</FONT><HR>Arrgh!!! Abashi, you still don't get it do you?<P>What else can a bard do when he had 1 or more MOBs mezzed during lullaby(pre-nerf)?  <BR>NOTHING!!!  Even if Lullaby was set at the EXACT same resist rate as mesmerise, it would still cost mana, from healers to keep the bard alive because of resists.  The fact that this spell wears off after a few ticks and has to be re-applied with the chance of more resists will be enough to make it impossible to keep going forever.<P>Now what can an enchanter do after he single target mezzes something?<BR>Cast a single target mez on something else?  Cast another single target mez?  Med for a bit?  Cast a buff? Maybe cast a debuff or a slow spell?<P>I really think the entire staff is missing the whole concept of bard songs.  The fact that a bard can do nothing else while playing their song, and the fact that each time a song is sung it gets to got through the entire stupid resist check, should mean that it should be (dare I say) more powerful than mesmerise.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I really hate that mana free argument.  First of all, almost everything a bard does is mana free.  If you want to use that argument, you should strip me of every song I have.  <P>Bard strength is not limited by mana, it is limited by our ability to twist, the duration and the resists on our songs.  Bringing mana into the picture is a fallacy brought on by a corporation that no longer has a perspective on bard abilities.<P>ABASHI:  Test this song yourself at level 20 on even con mobs.  Then come back here and tell us why you think it is overpowered compared to enchanter aoe mez.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>How about a return to a more open policy on testing these things?<P>One thing that is striking from the log of the GZ Lullaby test is the sense of openness.  Here is GZ and a bunch of players engaging in testing that they all can see.  GZ is interacting directly with players, answering questions and having some fun.  They all walked away having identified the problem by working together.<P>That sort of thing really fosters good relations between a company and its customers.  It really is a positive read.<P>Why not do the same thing for these other issues?  Although it seems that her efforts were earnest, it's not at all clear how Ester did the testing or even that she knew what she was looking for.<P>Get a few of the more respected and thoughtful bard players (Ro-kenn and Kaearia come to mind, among others) and test this with them in-game?  Let everyone log the session and discuss things and try to resolve misunderstandings.<P>A major part of the problem with the whole mez mess is that it seems so closed and some things appear to misunderstood.<P>I think it would be very useful to do this with Lullaby (if only to confirm things for everyone), and for the upcoming test of Pixie Strike, etc. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I believe much of the latest commentary has a base in the recent Bard postings.<BR>I play a Bard and have for the past year. I still enjoy my character and have adapted to the various changes that have happened over the months.<P>I've seen a lot of passionate posts on the boards from Bards trying to protect what once they had. The endless quotes and (excellent) statistical analysis from people who actually play the character for many hours, every day.<P>Discussions take place on many more boards than this one, and every person knows that the class simply doesn't "work as intended" regardless of what the QA department or GZ say.<P>But, stop to think for a minute. If these people had spent even a half of the time they'd devoted to analysing, criticising, flaming, retorting, quoting and amassing every shred of evidence necessary to back up certain claims, to their jobs and personal lives, how much happier would they be with themselves than with this game?<P>It's a game. Verant make the game. You play their game. They make the rules. If you don't like their rules, or their changes to the rules, you don't have to play their game. You sit for hours ... no, scratch that... you sit for months behind a computer monitor, focussed on an imaginary world called Norrath where the denizens are low-count polygons and the action is the same day after day. That's the world Verant made for you to play in. I wonder if they thought people would take it quite so seriously.<P>You accuse Verant of lying and deceiving the players day after day, week after week, month after month. And yet you complain to the very people who are naturally going to turn round and say your accusations are baseless and, at worst, inflamatory.<P>If you really want your complaints heard, take them to some organisation like the Better Business Bureau, or whatever exists in that form in your country.<P>But you know what? It doesn't matter, because it's just a game.<P>And if it's become more than just a game, then it's probably time to quit.<P>Kyrisha Soerbaird &lt;Praetoriate&gt;<BR>Bard of the 28th Song, Bertoxxulous.<P>PS. I can't *wait* until I get Cassindra's Chorus of Clarity at 32. You know why? Because it's *me* that decides if I'm going to give casters their dose of Clarity before, during or after combat... not them.<P>I like that kind of power. <P>Also, for the record: I haven't used Lullaby for lord knows how many months and yet, here I am on the threshold of achieving level 29 (I may not level as quickly as most, but I have a life too.) Bards are a jack of all trades, master of none... save adapting.<P>I adapt. I live. I level. I have fun playing their game.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>At last a comment from Abashi!!! Sure have pixie mez just a single target but for gods sake give us the same resist rate as the enchanters. The numbers dont lie, and enchanter can keep a group mezzed and gain mana, why cant a bard keep a single mob mezzed? Please adjust the resist rates to be inline with enchanters.

Guess they are right there with the Ranger and Wizards now.<P>Maybe it is class envy, we want to have spells/songs/abilities that work.   Not "work as intended", but work like they should work.  <P>example:  Rain spells for wizards & mages & druids<P>Guess if wanting things to work the right way is class envy, then guess I'm envious.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>However; we have flooded poor Abashi's brain with Bard/Wizard/Ranger/Monk/etc replies that all the good ones get lost amoung the noise.  The good ones that Abashi replies to, it seems like he reads but doesn't really under stand.  Sad really.  I love playng my bard.  I've used the Lullaby song to great effect, but that's ONLY playing that one song and getting the snot beat out of me every time it pulsed and broke mezz. Died a few times too...saved the group a few times too.  <P>Maybe Abashi is right ( and please don't just cut this one line out to reply to, if you do ), the song is "working as intended".  Bard's shouldn't be as good at crowd control as a chanter.  But, I say again, but,  how good at crowd control should they be?  <P>If they have a song that is for crowd control, why doesn't it work for crowd control?  <P>If that ONE song is the ONLY song a bard can sing while trying to control a crowd, why does it scare Verant so much?  Has Abashi ever seen a chanter mezzing a group of targets?  Has Abashi noticed how easy and almost mana free ( when you consider clarity & med ) a chanter can do crowd control?  Shouldn't a bard, singing NOTHING but one song be able to keep ONE mob mezzed?  A chanter can keep 2-4 mobs almost perma mezzed.  Lot's of people have already said that, but maybe if I repeat it, Abashi will acutally read that.  <P>Bah!  don't know why I'm wasting my time and your bandwidth with this.

</FONT><HR>Enough about drum animations.<P>Sure they would help the RPrs and 'complete' the look of the bard a bit more. <P>But having a drum animation doesn't have the game impact of a mez song which used to work simply not work any more.<P>The fact is, the bard lullaby needs to have the same resists as the level 16 enc mez song. And unlimited targets. The 3 second refresh time with the same resist as the enc spell is still enough for any bard to get their butt kicked every 3 seconds, and the unlimited number of mobs is part of the risk decision the bard should make.<P>Bards are the appropriate alternative to enchanters. It makes a LOT of sense to have this song restored to it's original state and for the single target versions to work reliably as well.<P>For the record, a good high level enc can reliably keep down 4 mobs indefinately. I've seen it.<P>These recent decisions are abysmal and I can't believe VI is seriously planning on standing firm on this. It's rediculous what they are doing. Once again they seem to be telling us exactly what we don't want to hear.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hi!<BR>granted i'm on the 8th page and i doubt anyone is going to read this, but here goes:<P>my bard was created around the time of the mez nerf, so i never quite got used to having that ability. the title of this thread is "Bard Issues." i'd rather not waste too much time on one of many issues that bards have.<P>what about our other broken/defective songs?<BR>dmg shied: gives ultravision then cancels it when song efect lapses.<P>what about the mysterious disappearing buffs? on numerous occassions i've had buffs kick then disappear on me. for example i'll see:<P>you feet move faster<BR>you slow down.<P>when i'm trying to evade a mob, this is the last thing i really need, another 3 seconds holding time before i can get away. this of course assumes that i'm not bashed in the mean time. at lvl 42 i'm still just under 1K hp, and can't take many hits from a lvl 35+ mob.<P>how about stuck bard songs? if you start singing a song and are bashed during startup, once in a while you are stuck singing that song. i've been killed by this one at least once. its a flat out defect-songs that must be refreshed will continue to hit a mob.<P>notes on bard charm kiting:<BR>somebody had complained about bards being able to solo 2 hill giants. i think this is fair compensation for the hybrid experience penalty. i know the other hybrids are getting shafted, sorry i wish there was something i could do to help them.<P>charm kiting is extreme risk. considering defects in the songs, such as speed song disappearing on you after it kicks, this isn't quite as safe or easy as folks would like to believe. once speed dies out on you, 2 33-36 mobs will catch and beat the crap out of you. at lvl 42, i have about 1k hp and start absorbing 90+ pt hits. this doesn't last long and i've been killed several times while charm kiting. <P>the ability to charm kite is one of two perks the bard class has. the other is running real fast.<P>our extensive linup of songs is at best rarely used by group-they are not needed or too dangerous. nobody uses bard speed song to travel. with lag groups get separated and the effect dyes out. nobody uses bard levitate for the party-how often is this actually needed? underwater breathing-forget it folks, i could get bashed or something. the only song that i have seriously used for party work is invisibility. the addition of see invisible really helped, actually it made the song worthwhile for groups.<P>the only time i see people looking for bards is usally when they need mana regen-its /ooc looking for bard or chanter at castle. plain and simple, this is the only thing groups really look to bards for. i don't want to knock our buff line too much. they are not major stats improvers, and do not scale with levels (hint). the problem is that people at best do not see any quantifiable difference to their performance. perhaps if the twist of song #1/36 were understood to improve tank performance by 22%, it would be considered more useful.<P>anyway-i'm not deleting the bard, his primary purpose these days is to charm kite those giants, i'm twinking hard on my cleric.<P>Nemesion Silversong, 42 bard of prexus.<BR>Linus, 35 warrior of prexus<BR>Physic, 17 cleric of prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The fact that those at Verant cannot see that Lullaby is useless in it's current form is apalling.  The fact that the song does not use mana has absolutely zero bearing on its power level.  This has been explained on these boards hundreds of times to no avail.  A single enchanter can easily keep 5 mobs mezzed forever without ever coming close to exceeding his mana regeneration rate with Clarity.  The risk an enchanter faces in attempting this feat is trivial compared to the risk a bard faces when attempting to do the same thing, even if the bard's resist rates were equal to the enchanters due to the very limited duration of the bard's Lullaby song.  Anything that can be done while using less mana than is being regenerated is effectively being done with NO MANA COST.  Apparently this is not unbalancing for an enchanter.<P>You have stated that bards are a support class.  That is truer than you know.  You have suceeded in reducing most classes in this game to being support classes for the real heroes of Norrath, those which are true casters.  If that is your "Vision" than you are sadly mistaken to think it can long endure.<P>The damage you have done will likely never be truly appreciated within the realm of EQ.  Many people will have invested such time in this game that they will not give it up as easily as they otherwise might.  The true damage will only be seen in your next game.  Those who are forewarned as to the approach you take to your games will not invest that time in other games you produce.  As you sow, so shall you reap.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The response makes perfect sense.  Verant decided that paying programmers to fix a problem that only affects 2% of the client base wasn't economically feasible.  So, they asked Abashi to come up with an excuse.  Abashi chose one that the brainless masses would accept.  Quite similar to the mez excuse.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I suspect you may be right in that theory about the chains nerf and bard mez nerf being economic in nature. Didnt Abashi come onto this threa not too long ago a comment about maybe changing our mez to single target instead of ae to compensate for not using mana. Only time will tell on this matter. Either verant follows up abashi's words with action. Or we come another step closer to proving the nerfs were indeed because they didnt want to waste time on bardic problems. <P>At this point I wont hazard a guess on which is the true outcome.<P>Nayami</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Since this thread is called "Bard Issues" and not just "Lullabye issues", I thought I'd add a copy of my recent bard-related post to this thread in the hopes that it may be seen before it scrolls off the board.<P>Some points to consider:<P>- Bards, like Necromancers, have a sense corpse spell that can be used to find player corpses<P>- Necros were recently enhanced with a spell that summons corpses<P>- Bards are missing a level 49 song<P>- Bards were designed as a support class. They should get abilities that help other classes. Necros were designed as a solo class, getting a support ability is just icing on the cake for them.<P>- The fact that summoning a corpse does not fit the classic image for a Bard is irrelevant. If anything fits the classic image for a Bard, it is a song that reliably puts enemies to sleep. Since this is not the case, obviously what is "fitting" in the traditional sense should not be a factor. Bards can sense corpses already, why not summon them?<P>- Bards have been nerfed a lot in the last year, Necros have received enhancements that make them more desirable to groups and more helpful to players in general. Bards were already weak with a bad exp penalty, necros were powerful with a low exp penalty (and a better mez spell).<P>- I am not asking that Necros lose summon corpse, I am asking that (for once) Bards get an enhancement that will fit perfectly with their role as a support class, and follow naturally with their level 4 sense corpse song.<P>- Necros are evil-aligned and make few friends because of their soloing. Bards are good aligned and generally well known and friendly. It thus makes sense that they would be able to help players in this way as well to balance the good/evil scale, especially for the Teams servers.<P>Conclusion: Make the level 49 Bard song a summon corpse song. Add restrictions to it if you feel it is necessary. This is only fair and logical, and would only improve the game's balance. If you feel this is a bad idea, please include some logical reason for it other than "no, we think only Necros should get this just 'cause"<P>- Zanen<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Mmmmm, I dont think its irrelevant if that spell doesnt fit in the bards repertoire coz otherwise you could give a wizzy healing spells  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>But I do agree that we should get some more song, and not only at 49. I would really love to see a fun song AND a usefull song every level (or 2 or 3 or whatever) because of the very few songs we have (vs other casters) we really cant afford a bunch of broken, useless songs. (Mez series, lack of stat buffers, infravision songs or the like should have a usefull song besides them at that certain level,etc). And its not to get ueberpowerfull but simply to BE a jack of all trades because now im FAR from one.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
