</FONT><HR>Kishstam posted:<BR>"I wonder if we'll see any more posts from him. That one definatly warrented a banning."<P>I doubt it.  VI and Abashi in particular tend to turn a blind eye to insults and flames that come from their boosters.  I'd love to go check out their office so I could see if the myopia that Abashi seems to project is indeed a part of their corporate culture.<P>  I also wonder if any current EQers own stock in Sony.  Having such shoddy PR and customer service that word actually gets out NOT to buy a game because of the "internet relations" guy probably falls under the category of not following due diligence towards ones shareholders.<P>  Abashi needs to realize that he is not only giving Verant a black eye (and hurting brand loyalty), but he's also hurting Sony's image.  Contrast Sony with Micro$oft (I can't believe I just said that), a company that actually DOES believe in winning over the customer (although many of their business practices are shady, they are no slouches when it comes to CS).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I dont know if there is an easy fix for to all of this, there probably isnt.  One thing that would help, though, would be if Abashi would follow up more to the threads he responds to.  A lot of time, a thread will get thousands of percent more traffic AFTER an Abashi post, and yet, that post wont get eny more attention and just ends up locked or corrupted.<P>Also, I dont pretend to know what all of Abashi's duties are at Verant, but I do know that his volume of posts here is pretty small relative to a lot of other people.  There are many, many threads deserving of some kind of official Verant attention that flat out just dont get it.

It was bad then, it's much worse now.<P>Just a tip, Abashi: people know when you are "spinning" them. Perhaps some spin-doctors can actually manipulate their audience without the victims catching on, but if so, you are definitely not one of THOSE spin-doctors.<P>You have aquired a reputation for being, shall we say, in the now imposed forum-speak, less than truthful in your answers. I could list all the techniques you use to avoid or distract from topics Verant hopes will die if ignored, but I've done that on numerous occasions and I'm sure you know exactly what I'm talking about.<P>The end result is that you are perceived, on this board, on other websites, and now, apparently, in gaming software stores &lt;LOL&gt; as: <P>1) A PR flack, a source of disinformation and manipulation, whose job is to trick EQ customers into believing their concerns are heard;<BR>2) A man who intensely dislikes the EQ customer base;<BR>3) An enforcer, a hatchet man, an intimidator whose job (or chosen vocation?) is to silence Verant's critics, and to suppress exposure on this messageboard of inforamtion which might hurt Verant's corpoarate image.<P>There is a lot of animosity on this board towards Verant, and while some of it can be written off as crybabies whining because they can't have EQ designed to their personal specifications, most of the anger is a result of customers perceiving (correctly IMO) that they are getting abused.<P>I'll give you some hints, Abashi: <BR>1) If you aren't going to give straight answers, it's better to not answer at all.<BR>2) If you try to invalidate or distract from people's issues (eg by claiming a certain problem can't be fixed due to absence of a player consensus, when we all remember the numerous unpopular decisions where Verant stated they weren't going to make decisions based on customer opinion - all hail The VisionTM), people are going to distrust you in future, and feel very angry to boot.<BR>3) If you make statements of fact which directly contradict your other recent statements of fact, you will get a reputation for untruthfulness.<BR>4) If you specifically promise that censorship of content, opinion or issues will NEVER occur, then ban all discussion of an entire issue, and delete every thread and post mentioning it, you will get a reputation for untruthfulness and untrustworthiness.<BR>5) If you perform the above blatant supression of an entire issue, then have the gall to immediately thereafter post a statement saying that we should feel free to discuss anything we want, provided we obey the rules of civility, then people will get VERY angry, and you will get a reputation for very cynical dishonesty.<BR>6) If you penalize an innocent and inoffensive post, which by no stretch of the imagination violated any rules, purely because you (incorrectly) interpret it as a criticism of yourself, you come across as a tyrant and a bully, and people will become angry and distrusting [note to MOderators: I am not calling Abashi a bully, I am saying that his actions might convey that impression of him - don't hurt me Hammer, don't ban my account, I'm littler than you ...].<P>In other words, you can continue to blame your customers for the anger and hostility on this board, you can continue to pretend to yourself that somehow every p*'d off person criticizing you is an immature neurotic, and apply increasingly brutal and draconian measures to bully and intimidate your critics into cowering silence.<P>Or you could take a really honest look at the situation, at the style and intention of so many of your responses, at the analyses and advice expressed by websites who don't need to placate Verant, at how Verant has dealt with so many issues, and ask yourself if maybe there isn't justification for all our anger and disrust. <P>You could look at the number of people, like myself, who started out supportive of, and polite to, you and Verant; and who have now become angry, untrusting and harsh, and ask yourself why we all changed.<P>You could consider that when many intelligent and articulate people (and many who are neither  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">) express a common criticism of your behavior, and the behavior of your employers, that they may actually have a point.<P>But I suspect that I already know which path you, and Verant, will choose.<P>Sky</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

If he went around all day posting that same mean-spirited comment, then that would be different.  Besides, you can hardly call Pullarius a Verant-booster.  He obviously doesn't like Lum, but that doesn't mean he likes Verant.  Read his comments on other threads.  We butt heads a lot, and people call me a VAK.  So if he's on the opposite side from me, he's probably not in the running for VAK of the Year.<P>[/em I can't believe I am defending Pullarius.  *slaps his own hand and steps away from the keyboard*]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

A result of an injured image is a decline in sales and revenue.  The numbers dont line up with your acusations.  <BR>4) Hurting Verants image? I dought it... its mostly people twisting what he says that make Abashi seem like a bad guy.  <BR>5) Hurting 'brand loyatly'?

</FONT><HR>What evidence are you speaking of, Pagan?  I posted my opinions and thoughts.  You did the same, but tried to claim that your opinions were "evidence".  <P>I can tell you exactly how Abashi is hurting brand loyalty.  I, and many of my friends that are flat out sick of Verant's handling have vowed never to buy another Verant product.  I have gone so far as to advise strangers in software stores not to buy their products either, and I'll continue to do so.  I know people in a similar position who plan to do the same, and also never buy anymore Sony products (I have a DVD player, I don't need a Playstation 2, thank you).<P>If you don't think that Verant currently has the worst name in the online gaming industry then you are deluding yourself.  I'd really like to know what server you're playing on where everything is peachy all the time.  Funny, when I played, the feelings of disgust towards Verant were by and large universal, and I played on three different servers.<P>This board is the only real mouthpiece that players have to get in touch with any of the EQ team.  Can you account for the uncommonly negative tone around here?  Funny, I've lurked on CoD (for Asheron's Call) and UO's main boards and the vitriol is nowhere near as intense.<P>I really don't know what to tell all of you folks that continue to praise Verant even after all of the lies and "enhancements" that we've been subjected to.  Maybe you enjoy slow torture and being lied to repeatedly by a digital crack dealer, but don't drag us all into your private hell.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Cuprin:<P>There always has been someone from Verant posting.  If not here, then on EQ Vault or on Usenet.  What there hasn't always been is someone from Verant:<P>- Issuing official warnings that could result in banning for discussing topics that have been addressed in the past.<P>- Locking threads because the game issues being discussed were not issues the person from Verant cared to read about.<P>- Proudly announcing the part they played in getting classes nerfed, and threatening more nerfs in the future if we complain too much.<P>- Constantly talking like we know nothing about the game most of us have probably invested more hours in playtime in than anyone working at Verant.<P>- Generally being rude, condescending, and smarmy towards their customers.<P>So yes, I say that the level of communications pre-Abashi was better than the level of communications since he took his position.  Indeed, I would, once again, go as far as to say that if Verant cut off ALL communications on these boards, it would be better for the morale of the community as a whole than the direction Abashi is taking Verant's relationship with us in.  Increased volume does not necessarily equal increased quality.  And that's not a matter of kissing Lum's ass, it's a simple statement of fact.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>After reading this thread I come to the conclusion that Verant would be better off closing down their forums entirely. Instead they should have one or more e-mail addresses to accept feedback (general or topic specific.) They could then pick and choose from those messages and either put up nice, tidy information bulletins or perhaps take a more "informal" tone by posting an excerpt of a single message with a response.<P>That way they would not have to deal with the following:<BR>1. Any negative postings on their official web site of any kind, save those they choose to display;<BR>2. Anonymity of the author of information on website making it Verant's voice rather than that of any specific person;<BR>3. Cut down on the ability of their subscribers being able to mobilize on issues that are awkward or unlikely to be resolved to the satisfaction of those subscribers.<P>If Verant had done that from day 1, I think that the perception of their customer service would be far better. <P>That disappoints me becuase it would largely be due to the fact that there would be no forum for complaint and public communication. Instead we'd have some _real_ spin doctoring.<P>I'd suggest that it's time to take a step back and consider the alternatives to our current status quo. <P>Anyone who thinks that the replacement of an employee such as Gordon would somehow magically turn around the thinking of Verant towards how they structure their game is sadly mistaken. <P>That being the case what exactly is the complaint? That we don't have an advocate in Gordon? Well the reality is that we didn't get together to form an advocacy organization paying Mr. Wrinn's salary.  He's paid by Verant to do a job and a basic expectation of an employee is to cooperate with their employers expectations. Any expectations that anyone working for Verant will stage a military coup in the name of any particular issue that runs counter to a company decision is deluded. I don't know to what extent Mr. Wrinn represents our multiple points of view. I do know that unless he's planning on resigning he's not going to share his internal job frustrations by posting them on the boards. We're not privy to those discussions here, and decisions will be made that create some unhappiness. If your definition of spin doctoring is that internal discussions are not fully disclosed then yes, there is a lot of spin doctoring going on. I don't undertand how anyone would expect to _not_ see that kind of "spin doctoring" otherwise known as professionalism.<P>Personally I'm glad that Verant perserveres in maintaining these boards. I say that as a player. If I actually owned stock in Verant (not Sony, 'cause let's face it, Verant's a tiny chunk of that pie) I'd want the boards closed given some of the previous responses about negativity spreading to affect sales of EQ. As a stockholder I'd advocate for some REAL spin doctoring by pulling the teeth out of these boards and totally controlling communication. There's some real corporate thinking to consider.<P>Thank you for providing the boards, Verant. (There, guess I've sealed my fate in the eyes of those reading). I'm glad you keep these boards open despite the negativity. I think that shows a true committment to a non-corporate ideal.<P>Aeloryn 35 Enchanter<BR>Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>LoL - I have only read about a quarter of these posts (life's too short) but I figure I won't have missed much - even the ones I did read were simply slightly reworded versions of previous ones.<P>I drop into the boards 2 or 3 times a week, mainly to check the tradesfolk and newbie ones. But I usually drop in here as well. And see the same names time after time after time after time. Both for and against VI.<P>I'm not even going to begin to comment on Lum's figures - they are based on poor data at best.<P>As far as Abashi goes, I started playing about the same time he appeared here and, to be fair to him, has shown a level of patience and good humour that I would never have managed considering the way many people on this board 'speak' to him. Maybe some of you think CS Rep is synonomous with whipping boy, but not me. From day one he has had to put up with personal attacks, invariably from the same few dozen people. And as someone earlier said, when he does join the fun side of things here, he gets attacked for that as well.<P>As for someone else claiming that asking in game would give a result of 90% of people not liking Abashi - what you'd actually find is about 90% of people going 'who?' because they are busy out there enjoying the game.<P>As far as the rest of it goes, does it really matter that much. I would be the last to say is perfect (can anyone say xp penalty or soulfire), but it's the best damn entertainment value you'll get for $10 a month.<P>Please feel free to disagree/flame/be very upset by life in general, at length and in detail - I'm off to play.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I'd laugh at the majority of the posters here but the situation is too sad even for morbid humor.  To even consider the idea that removing Gordon would improve our opinon of Verant or that communication would improve is a sad testament to one's near-sightedness. As has been posted, Abashi is nothing more or less that what he claimed: a go-between. That's it. He fights through the bile and garbage that get posted on these boards and others to find the "gold." He takes the concerns that we post and brings them up in the tuning meetings so that the ones responsible for the changes know. Then he brings back the decisions that were made. How many ways do you think you put a spin on "Yes, we think that's a great idea" or "No, that just isn't possible?"  Even if you were to remove him, his successor would be bringing the EXACT SAME INFORMATION to us. Personally I would prefer a straight "No, that's not going to happen" to a sugar coated placebo that made me realize the the Heaven and Earth acutually WOULD pass away if melee characters got bind.  <P>I say three cheers for both Verant and Abashi. They made a great game and they couldn't pay me enough to take Abashi's place.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Phelan:<P>&lt;&lt; They don't ban for one over the top post. <BR>&gt;&gt;<P>They DO ban for one over the top post. They banned my other account for one not very "over the top" post, without any warning, and without my ever having received a prior warning on any of my accounts.<P>The reason? I said Abashi was untruthful (of course I used the since-banned l-word, which was not verboten at the time - but to refer to his actions, not his person) for promising no censorship of opinions, then banning discussion of the entire Tweety issue, deleting all threads discussing it and stating that all future posts mentioning the issue would be deleted; then shamelessly claiming that there was no censorship and we were free to post any opinion we felt.<P>If that combination of statements isn't reasonably deserving of the "untruthful" accusation, what is?<P>They also banned Tweety's roommate for one post, coincidentally on the same topic. Anyone see a pattern? Like me, his post was not really "over the top", though it was extremely critical. It is highly debatable whether his post was a flame at all. Like me, he had no prior warnings, and reveived none in this case, just an immediate banning.<P>See lumthemad.net: "WARNING: LIVING WITH TWEETY MAY PROVE HAZARDOUS TO YOUR EQ ACCOUNT".<P>Don't kid yourself: Verant HAS banned people for one post, without warnings; and they WILL undoubtedly continue to do so. Your chances of "1-strike and you're out" are probably much greater if you are posting informAtion or opinions Verant wants suppressed. OTOH, your chances of an immediate ban are probably zero if you are flaming Verant's critics  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>Sky<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Pagan<P>&lt;&lt; Hurting Verants image? I dought &lt;sic&gt; it... its mostly people twisting what he says that make Abashi seem like a bad guy. <BR>&gt;&gt;<P>When clerks in game stores warn people not to buy EQ because of Abashi (this actually happened), it IS hurting Verant's image.<P>The extent to which Verant goes to suppress certain topics (especially related to bannings) in this forum, shows that they think so too.<P>I can tell you that 80% of my negative opinion of Verant comes from Abashi's behavior towrds the customers (and from similar behavior on the part of Brad, et al), and only 20% from the game itself. I didn't need anyone to "twist" his words - his own twisting of the issues was what did the trick. <P>Or do you imagine that there is some mythical twister of Abashi's words who has caused as all to lose trust in him, and in Verant? Like some awesomely powerful person just decided one day that they would assassinate Abashi's reputation for no reason, and everyone else who criticizes Abashi does so because we've been infulenced by some "twisted words", and Abashi is really a fine, honest, caring individual beloved of all EQ players.<P>Come on, the guy is trashed on every EQ forum I've ever visited. He is widely distrusted, and his bad reputation has spread all over the EQ web world.<P>Verant's lousy CS is well known - there have been several articles on it in gaming magazines, one of which, in a notorious episode (which led to my fortunate discovery of Lum) was actually pulled under pressure from Verant, then replaced after public outcry. <P>They are getting a bad rep for their attitude to their customers, and they deserve every bit of it.<P>Sky<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Skyye:  You've had an account banned?  Bummer.  Last I heard, Verant bans customers, not accounts, so this means that this account should be banned too.  I wonder if they'll track you down to do so.<P>Further, get over yourself.  It has nothing to do with suppression of facts or opinions.  That task is hopeless, since there are plenty of other newssites out there.  They would not be foolish enough to think they could do so.  I don't know the circumstances or the truth of the matter regarding Tweety's roommate.  None of us do.<P>Anyway, I'm done with this, for it's now degenerated into opinion bashing and that's boring.  Lum's methodology is suspect.  That's my opinion.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I truly feel like the minority then...<P>1) I have never felt that Abashi's statements were untruthfull, negative/inflamitory, condesending, nor dissrespectful.  <BR>2) I have never had a problem with my dealings with CS Reps.  (in game, and out of game)<BR>3) I feel that people who tell others "Dude dont buy that game! Their customer relations guys is a JERK!"  are not giving the whole story, so should hush...  One can play the game and have a PERFECTLY fun expericne, and not even know these messageboards exist or that Abashi even exists for that matter.  I played for months befor ever coming here.  Talking to Abashi doesnt have anything to do with how fun the game is.  So why tell people "Dont buy that! Abashi is a jerk and lies to yoU!" when it wont effect yoru gameing experince?  <P>What blows my mind is the hypocrosy (sp).  I see all these people groaning on and on and on and on about how horrible this is, how bad abashi is, how their class is worthless, yet you have to be a paying customer to post here... so why in the name of Innurok are you still here?!?! If you went to a movie, and it just plain SUCKED, would you seriously sit through it?  I dont think Big V should have to change anything at the whim of someones cry over something they dont like.  Now they SHOULD look into it, and determine "is this really a concern to how we want our game to be?"  And if so, change it accordingly, and if not they dont have to... and why should they?  (and i truely belive the do conduct themselves in this manner, yet so many people think if they whine enough they will get it changed)  Bottome line:  If something pisses you off that much, why do you continue to put youself there?  Sadomasticism?  If you have such a huge problem with it, move along...   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>It is pretty well established that VI cares about what Lum says. All you need to do is recall the Hakosako incident to prove that. As for Lum's numbers I have to wonder how they would look if you extrapolated them out based on number of players subscribing to the games? <P>If there is only one tenth of the total number of players on AC as on EQ then wouln't you need to multiply the AC numbers by ten in order to provide a representitive number? If you think about it in those terms it seems to me that the numbers are all about equal. But then I am not a statisticion(sp). <P>I must admit that I have pretty much given up on Lum's site though. I have come to the conclusion that he has appointed himself as the "Voice of the Common Gamer". I do not remember voting for him and I do not feel his opinions represent mine or even the majority. I have noticed however, that he seems to stir up trouble every once in a while if for no other reason than to keep his number of hits up.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
