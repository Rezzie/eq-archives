He suggested that people using wurmslayer in their 50's were Evil and Bad (or something to that extent) because other weapons were so superior.<P>While there are indeed better weapons, wurmslayer holds up very well in post 50 combat, lagging only a few percent behind lamentation.<P>He was misled by the Delay is King faction.<P>---<P>Your faction with Delay_is_King went down.<BR>Your faction with Damage_over_Time went up.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Physts:<P>What was that rape comment for?  It's amazing me how immature and insulting the "no nerfs!" crowd is being.  Wait a minute, no it's not amazing me at all.<P>"Ask for the old stuff to get better. Never ask for a nerf. Please put some thought into your complaints next time and think about what really ruins the game."<P>I have yet to hear of a game that actually died because of overnerfing (not saying it couldn't happen, just saying I haven't heard of it).  What I -have- heard that kills games far more often is Mudflation.  Mudflation is exactly the scenario we're talking about.  At some point, something gets put into a game that overshadows everything else (Wurmslayer is a perfect example).  So, in order to keep loot balanced, your suggestion is taken and rather than fixing one item, everything else (which in EQ would be like 300 weapons worse than this one) is made better too.  But wait, one of those weapons that was upgraded, or a new one that comes along, is now made out of whack too.  SO, boom, upgrade everything else again, cause we can't just have a nerf, oh no, we need to rework 300 items again cause we all know just how easy balance is to achieve  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif">, everyone on these boards could have done a better job than Verant with their eyes closed.  And then you upgrade again... and again... and soon you have games like Diablo 2 and Asheron's Call, that are easy as sinning, no challenge at all, gets very boring, people finish it (or see that it won't be any challenge to finish) in a couple of weeks and put it on the shelf.<P>It's happened to many MUD's out there, precisely because there's this vanguard of people in every one that can't look at a bigger picture and repeatedly intone "nerfs are bad, nerfs are bad".  It usually takes them witnessing the destruction of a game in this way for them to realize, but by that time it's too late.<P>Frankly, I think Verant has been both light and wise with the nerf stick in general, and have managed to maintain the integrity of the game without going over the top.<P>Goji:<P>Have you read any of the arguments?<P>No, there aren't "innumerable better weapons in the game".  That's our whole point.  Milena pointed out beautifully that this ranks among the best weapons in the game, certainly at pre 50 levels and reasonably usable all the way up to 60, and the very low risk and time factor is completely totally out of whack with the rest of the quests and loot in Norrath.  And it is coming into the game at what I would estimate is ten times faster than any other weapon except maybe the axe of the ironback.  Not even a BIBS drops this much, not even close, and comparatively speaking, the BIBS is now a joke.<P>Finally, remember people, I'm on one of the oldest servers.  If your server is a lot younger, the problem may not be as evident, but what happens on Tunare is indicative of what WILL happen on ALL servers once they reach the same age.  It's basically unavoidable.  Supply and Demand will do this.<P>Letalis:<P>Your post was one of the best responses.  I already answered some of your comments tho.<P>"At some point in time, given the group that is required to get a wurmslayer, and the fact that the X scale is kinda a hassle, and it takes some time to find Sir Hobble, I doubt any group that has the ability to do that would do it if they knew they would only get 300pp for their efforts."<P>One, the X scale can be gotten in minutes, you just need one person with the right faction that can tele, a wizard worshipping Solusek Ro got 5 of us the X scale within 20 minutes or so.<P>Two, while I would agree that if you had to go out of your way to get this, in an area that offered little else, then it would probably stop being farmed eventually.  But in the very same area and quest, you get a tattered mantle on EVERY Gullerback (an -extremely- good shoulder piece that most anyone except pure casters can wear, AC 12 Hp 20 and some disease resist, has made crested spaulders unsellable/worthless because everyone has the tattered now too, and that's despite the fact that it's lore).  You can also get very good exp from the local giants and sarnaks, the latter of which can drop the excellent Earrings of Station, ac 5 Str 5, awesome melee earring.  You can also get the tree weave -right- there, a 25 ac tunic that chain classes can wear (in comparison, Ivy Tunic is 19 ac).  When you've got a campsite -that- sweet, and the named wurms are popping very closeby and every 6 to 8 minutes, they're -gonna- get killed.  And groups will still get set up with both scales in groups of 6 in a matter of 3 hours or so.  And if 6 people all have the scales, even if a wurmslayer is only worth 300pp each, that's still 1800pp between all of 'em, and for the relatively low hassle for such a high stat weapon 6 people will probably take the small bit of hassle to turn 'em in together.<P>3)  Like I said, the X scale isn't hard, and most high levels do a lot of their banking in FV.  It is no big deal to just shove the scales in the bank and ask any tracker if the Squire is up each time you go there, odds are very high he'll be up at least once out of every 3 or 4 or so times that you just go to FV to bank or buy food or whatever.  And there's also a method to make him pop very quickly for those who know the details. <P>If you know how to do this quest, it is VERY fast, convenient, and easy.  And because the named wurms pop so fast and so close to such a great camping area (one that would probably still be constantly camped for exp like the paw spires in South Karana even if all the loot in the area became worthless), I don't think that the annoyance factor is going to keep people from doing this quest forever.  OH, by the way, doing the quest got me a good 3 pixels or so of exp in 48 too, that alone would keep people doing the quest too.<P>Qwinn Windfletcher<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>"There is just one reason why the price is going down, and that is because you are farming the item on you server!!!!"<P>-I- am farming the item?  I did the quest twice.  Traded the first one, and believe me, the person I traded with was by -no means- robbed  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  The second one is mine.  Then I stopped - I don't like selling things to people that I know will devalue quickly, I don't like conning people.  <P>Most other people I know, once they find out about it, do it at least five or six times each.  And they're not typical farmers either, they are there getting exp, and the wurms are just, well, RIGHT THERE.  And the wurms give exp to people who can do the quest.  Are you telling them not to kill the wurms?  Or should they just kill them and not loot?<P>If you want to come to each server and tell the dozens and dozens of people hunting in BW to please leave the wurms alone as they are dropping the price on the item and flooding the servers with an overpowered weapon, perhaps that might help things  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif"><P>Honestly, I think the comparisons to the Stein are both appropriate and silly.  How many held int items were there in the game before the stein came out?  Isn't it boring seeing every caster with the same equipment?  Coulda sworn I've seen complaints about that on these boards.  And, does a stein of mogguk ever increase a caster's damage output by up to 60%?  -MAYBE- it increases a caster's mana by 5%.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The Stein of Mogguk comparison is very apt.  And, as others have said ... the WS is a very good weapon - not uber. Thankfully, there are also other examples of very good items in the game that "normal" players can get without devoting their lives to the game.  It is unfortunate that there is a percentage of players in the game who are only happy if everything they have is superior to everything most others have.<P>YES, I got a WS for my level 25 Warrior twink ... and I am very happy about it.  I have been in this game since beta 3 and I can't get uber items because my time schedule is such that I play in mostly 2-3 hour sessions.  So every once in a while Verant throws the "normal" players (I refuse to use the word "casual" because it doesn't apply) a bone. Thank you Verant!<P>As for you elitists who can't be happy when other have what you have, you really should re-examine your reasons for playing.  I couldn't care less if the guy next to me has a WS ... so what ... let him have fun too.  This doesn't affect me at all.  I am happy that my weapon performs well and I am having fun with it.  I don't care what the thing costs because I don't farm items and I don't plan to sell it. You think we should worry that the poor farmers are going to be hurt by dropping prices ?<P>And, finally, the thing isn't that easy to get.  It is easy for HIGH LEVEL people to get.  Just try to kill Gullerback without at least a high 40s group.  Fine ... they put in the time to get their levels so they earned it.  And it's no big deal that you get a Tainted Mantle from Guller ... again, so what.  The things are lore and you have to go to a remote area to get it. So some lower level people can afford to buy the mantle because it sells pretty cheap ... it makes them very happy, which, I think, is the reason for a game. Let people enjoy these things and worry about your own business.    </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>  Quinn, my deepest appologies if I came off as being offensive in my earlier post.  Was just analizing outloud about the phychological ramifications...<BR>  Anyhow, my point was that the drops are lame enough allready.  Mobs in their 20s are still dropping rusty, 30s and 40s fine steel.  What self respecting 10th level pc carries fine steel around, let alone rusty.<BR>  If you love a real tough challenge, you're fully capable of nerfing yourself.  You wear patchwork, equip rusty weapons, not memorize your latest spells, etc.<BR>  I, on the other hand, can't do a damm thing about leveling easier (short of cheats and exploits).  I, and I think most players in the game, want the best of the best equipment as soon as I can possibly get my hands on it.  I'd love to have a set of trance sticks and an fbss, and so would most monks.<BR>  I've had a great deal of fun, but I'd like to have more to show for almost two years of EQ than a 28th monk, 21st druid, 20th cleric, 20th necro, and others too lowly to mention.  As you can see, I don't powerlevel.  There are a good number of other race/class combos I'd love to explore, but I haven't acheived even half of the glory of my main character.  And nerfs certainly won't help me.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Think of how much faster it'd be if the lazy people around the giant fort would actually try killing Gullerback by their own initiative rather than from necessity.. (PH for Azdalin, rare scale, blah blah).<P>Not that I care about who wants to use these, but the weapon, especially after the low/high delay adjustment (or was that on two handers only?), simply outperforms most 1H drops from 50+ dungeons.<P>And yes, Stein of Moggok is a good comparison.<P>Lech<BR>53 Heretic<BR>Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The comparison with the stein of moggok is not good. <P>just 10 int plus a few stats will not get a caster much more powerful even if it's the best thing he can get. Gear means almost nothing to casters. <P>Good weapons do make an enormous difference. <P>And I hate to bring this up but it does create balance issues. At the mid levels, a warrior (or ranger) using wurmslayers will constantly outdamage monks, rogues, magicians and necros, and I am sorry but that is just plain wrong. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The Jade Mace is a better weapon than the Wurmslayer, in terms of damage output (it's also useable in the offhand, which is a nice bonus considering you'll eventually upgrade). <P>The Jade Mace is the common drop off the Drolvarg Captain, a rather common spawn in the perpetually camped Karnor's. Should we expect the Jade Mace to plummet in value also? I'm sure it comes into the game at a rate similar to that of the Wurmslayer.<P>Anyways, the Wurmslayer problem is nothing new. Months ago every newbie warrior with a couple high level friends or 2kpp could get a yak, which was, at the time, pretty uber. People complained then too. Those that didn't have yaks got to benefit from drastically reduced prices on other weapons. How much did an EB Mace cost? Nothing, despite it being a pretty good weapon for the time.<P>Now that Kunark has raised the bar and really nice weapons are dropping that high level types can obtain fairly easily, the lesser weapons are dropping in price like they should. People have always been able to get weapons that rate a 9 out 10 at low levels, they're just different weapons now.<P>Holden.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Nerfs are always bad, if you like this game.  <P>If you are working for Asherons Call or Horizons, etc., then nerfing in EQ is a good thing, it will mean higher numbers of subscribers for your product when the nerfed individuals leave EQ.  <P>As for the W-Slayer, other people having it will not decrease my enjoyment of the game.  The closest thing I have to a W-Slayer is an exe axe, which is slower and 2-handed, but so what?  What other people have does not hurt me.

</FONT><HR>Rupee:<P>It's a matter of degree.  The Axe of IB obsoleted a -couple- of weapons, no big deal.<P>Wurmslayer outclasses every single 1hs weapon I can think of that existed prior to Kunark, including a few god and dragon weapons.  It far outclasses the executioner's axe -all by itself-, and it can be wielded in one hand, AND it gives AC!  It outclasses -everything- preKunark.  The fact that it does that, tho, is not the problem.  There are a few better weapons out there in Kunark, and you don't see me complaining about them.  It is that it ouclasses everything AND it is as easy to get as an Axe of the Ironback.  Everyone I've talked to who has done the quest agrees that it is far far too easy.  It threatens to completely obsolete to the point of being labelled newbie gifts not just a couple of weapons, but just about every weapon in the game outside of a couple of 50+ kunark dungeons.<P>Musicicus:  It may be part of a greater quest, yes, but when the weapon in and of itself is so high powered - does it make a difference?  I wonder what the heck that greater quest could be for that would make it worthwhile to give the weapon up for.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
