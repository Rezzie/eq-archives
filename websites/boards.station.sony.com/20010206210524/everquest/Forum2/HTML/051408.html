</FONT><HR>You can read the previous discussion here:http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050739.html<BR>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989.html<P>Absor<BR>Station Member posted 01-22-2001 12:38 PM <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>All right, due to the impression that you all have given me, it seems that I need to cover wizards next…<BR>I’ve already made several notes to myself about wizards, and I may as well start out this discussion with those notes. Keep in mind that these ‘talks’ are geared toward making sure that the classes are ‘balanced’. Please work toward that goal when posting (yes, even if that means you suggest a ‘nerf’). But I’m also interested in hearing about bugs and such too, I’m just not going to focus on them.<P>Here are the notes that I already have. Keep in mind that these are only my notes, and just because I’ve listed something does NOT mean that I like the idea or that the designers are working on making changes based on these notes. This is just what it is, a list of ideas. I’ve also added my notes to you all under the header of Note:<P>AoE spells: Mentioned elsewhere… (earlier on my list, probably under mages: basically the idea here is that maybe pets should be removed from the equation).<P>Gaze/Glimpse: Due to the clipping plane, these spells don’t really allow further seeing, just zooming in (which makes your resolution worse anyhow).<P>Note: this may not be ‘fixable’ at all due to the way the game works. It’s not like we can force your PC into a higher resolution when you use this spell…<P>Fade/Shadowstep/Yonder: There seems to be a problem with these spells. Since they will not teleport you up, they don’t work too well in hilly terrain; because the spell only sends you a few feet (stopping when it reaches a hill or building).<P>Note: Again, this may also not be something we can change, but it’s on the list.<P>Bind Sight: Seems to cause viewer to see the target as running into walls or spinning in circles if target goes up an incline.<P>Enstill: It seems that this spell is not a more useful or more powerful root, it’s just more expensive. <P>Cazic Gate: At level spell is attained, using it will most often cause death because the caster appears amidst many aggressive monsters that /con white to them.<P>Note: We’ve actually discussed this before. If I remember correctly, the general feeling was that having a dangerous gate like this wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. But it is also still on my list.<P>Tishan’s Relocation: This spell evacuates you to a very dangerous location, a monster crossroads in the Skyfire mountains. Could the location be moved, or was it intended that this be a very dangerous evacuation spell?<P>Note: See note about Cazic Gate.<P>Concussion: A level 39 spell dropped by a creature in a location that requires a party of level 50s to handle. Should it be in such a location?<P>Icestrike effects: Graphical effect looks like fire.<P>Lightning Bolt effects: looks exactly like Fire Bolt.<P>Other lightning and cold effects: It seems that there might be other spells that have the look of fire when they should not.<P>Having just re-read this list, I see nothing at all related to actual balancing stuff. This is all nit-picky stuff about minor effects and bugs and such (with the possible exception of Area of Effect spells, changing those would certainly have an effect on class balances). So, please, try to focus on balance issues…<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Brief statement of some concerns about the wizard class.<BR>The biggest negative concerns about the wizard class.<P>1) Many wizards do not feel that they are adding much if any value to their groups.<BR>2) Wizards are not ‘pulling there load’ vs. velious uber mobs, 100k+ hit point mobs make the damage a wizard can deal, very mute.<BR>3) A wizard has a very hard time staying in a battle due to very long med times.<BR>4) Due to many of the enhancement in the various melee classes, wizards can no longer keep up with the damage being dealt by some of the melee classes, both in speed and damage.<BR>5) Wizards lose a lot of power due to not having a pet, though giving us one is not a solution many wizards want, or what I am going to ask for. Pet classes at least can offer their pet as a source of value to a group even when they are oom.<BR>6) Downtime due to medding is the single biggest drawback, and a down fall to this class. I can agree to some of this to some degree.<P>I would like to point out some of the positive points of the class. Which I don’t feel any more change is necessary in to obtain or maintain balance. A change in any of these areas I feel would create over powering in one area or another.<P>1) Equally fast Evocation spells to other classes, the 3 second cast of DD spells, and 2 second cast of PB AE spells, is enough to fill the wizards role as masters of quick damage, in any group AE or single pull situations.<BR>2) Spell Damage compared to other classes is slightly higher then most other classes spells or has a lower cast time and mana usage factor, therefore this maintains are title of masters of evocation.<BR>3) AE spell Damage or delay is exceptional nice, so for the extremely rare groups where these spell work we fit nicely.<BR>4) Overall efficiency of the class is good, compared to battles against single mobs with DD spells or multiple mobs with AE spells.<P>What can be done to the wizard class?<P>Make a change to the way Harvest works. Bare with me please this is slightly different then most ideas you have previously read.<P>Cut the mana regained from Harvest in half to 150 maximum, but then also cut the recast time on the spell to 4 ½ minutes. This is not really any different then the spell currently works, however the real change needed is below. <P>Have Harvest take the number of members in the group and multiply it times the amount of mana normally gained if not grouped. So for example, if I normally gain 150 points of mana from Harvest (solo), if I am grouped with 6 other people I would Harvest 900 points of mana.<BR>This is 4 nukes, or 2,652 extra points of Damage every 4 ½ minutes at level 55, which is about the same amount of damage a mage or necro with there pet is going to out damage me by in this time frame. <P>Before I go any farther someone other then me came up with this idea and the good reasons why, but I liked it so much I decided to make sure someone reads this. I edited the whole thing but only slightly, so this may or may not reflect the orginial authors ideas.<P>1) This will help us to keep up with the tanks and pets in damage output.<BR>2) From a role-play sense, we gather mana from are surrounding. So this should be the people and the magical items around us, the best and easiest measurement would be how many people are in are group.<BR>3) Doing so would not allow us to solo something we couldn’t before.<BR>4) Encourage us to find a group.<BR>5) It doesn’t become a PvP issue.<BR>6) Its more fun casting nukes then sitting on are butts doing nothing, holding just enough back for evacs.<BR>7) Would help us stay in the long battles with Velious Uber Mobs, battles lasting up to a hour.<BR>8) Would not be over powering on previous mobs, as I feel a gap is becoming larger, between melee efficency and caster. <P>56 Wizard of the Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think the biggest balance issue is that wizards are very group dependant, but unlike other classes, wizards don't bring a whole lot to a group.  <P>I have a level 35 wizard.  I can spend hours trying to get into a group.  If I log in as my warrior - 5 minutes;  My Enchanter - 5 minutes.  My Cleric - 2 minutes;  My Necro - 10 minutes.  Sure, sometimes it takes a while, but in general, my other-classed characters have a much easier time getting into a group.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think an easy, quick fix for Wizards is the mana ratio. If the spells had a better ratio, the Wizard would become more fun to play, and easier to get in a group. This would also help the Al'Kabor spells to be used in the game, additionally, if the Al'Kabor spells were given perhaps, a special property like greatly reduced resistance, they would become useful. It's ok if it's mana ratio is not as great, if it doesn't get resisted very often. Also, the idea of damage shields that give mana back is an excellent idea. <P>I don't think that this would make the Wizard too powerful, after all, in terms of magic, the Wizard *SHOULD* be more powerful than any other class. Since the Wiz has no pet or armor, it would only serve to balance the game by increasing thier ability to kill with magic. <P>Xantriph &lt;Flame Of Havok&gt;<BR>Level 14 Dark Elven Wizard<BR>Vallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Hopefully this thread leads to some meaningful changes for the wizard class.  Eight months ago I parked the wizard that was my first character, and I have refused to go back ever since.  The issues that drove me to stop playing my wizard were these:<P>1) I couldn’t cast on a mob that was red to me, meaning two or more levels higher.  When that happened, my role in the group was relegated to sitting and watching the rest of my group fight while I collected free experience.  I can tell you from experience that after three or four pulls where you don’t contribute anything, you WILL be disbanded from a group.  <BR>1) My mana was good for about five or six casts of my best damage spell.  Since this was the case, my normal routine was to cast my biggest spell, followed by my midrange spell, then sit and meditate until close to the end of the combat, at which point I again stood up to cast my highest damage spell.  Three spells were hardly contributing that greatly to the groups damage output, but it was all I could afford mana and aggro wise. <BR>1) On the occasion where my group overpulled and I needed to cast my big damage spells, without care for what my mana supply was, I still couldn’t contribute as greatly as I would have liked to.  Chain casting of big damage spells would aggro whatever I was casting on, and my life span would be all of about five seconds.<P>There are a few things that I think should be changed in order to restore balance and worth to the wizard class, and none of them involve infringing upon any other classes abilities.  We don’t need increased defense skill, we don’t need to backstab or wear heavier armor, and we don’t need Uberspell_00 that class X has in order to be playable.  What we do need is for the powers that be to recognize that our role is to deal the highest magic-caused damage of any class, nothing else.  We can’t buff, heal, debuff, mez or charm.  Our job is to make the mobs hurt like no one else can, and if we get 100% resists on things that are two or three levels above us, we can’t do the one and only thing that our class is able to contribute to the group.<P>With all that in mind, here are the things that I propose in order to help the wizards out.<P>1) We should be able to effect any mob within seven or so levels of our own.  Before anyone objects, let me say that there are other classes that can do exactly that with their DD’s.  There is no reason that we shouldn’t be as good or better than any other class at effecting higher level mobs than ourselves.  The excuse that post 50 we get lure spells isn’t one that holds any water.  We have to first get to 50th level, a task which is made harder by how difficult it is for us to find a group, and by the increased resists that we get at pre-Kunark levels.  <BR>1) We need some sort of quick cast, low mana spell that lowers our aggro to the mobs.  That way if we choose to cast multiple DD’s without concern for our mana, we can do so without needing a cleric to Res us for the next battle.<BR>3) This third item is more a suggestion than a need, but I still think that it has real merit.  The mana cost should be reduced for all of our direct damage spells by twenty-five to thirty-three percent.  At first the percentages sound high, but consider this; Most wizards can cast about six of their highest damage spells before being out of mana.  Decreasing the cost by a third would allow us to cast eight spells, which is certainly not a game unbalancing amount of damage.  It is well accepted that as things stand in EQ today, wizards are not the highest damage dealers of the caster classes.  All that we can lay title to is the ability to cause the most damage in the least amount of time, assuming that the mobs would actually let us live long enough to let us cast all of our spells on them.<P>I hope this post reaches the right ears, I know that with the hundreds of others, some things can get lost in the confusion.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Druid spell Wildfire level 59:<P>1024 damage for 320 mana<P>This spell is avaiable at the Vendors.<P><BR>Where is our purchasable DD spell at 59?<BR>Where is our purchasable Magic based DD spell at 60?<BR>Are there at level 60 any purchasable DD spells for us, the Masters of Magical damage? NO..... hm. Well, that sounds balanced, pretty.<P>At level 60 i nuke in the best case for 731 damage / 215 mana, if i have not yet obtained the level 60 rare rare rare rare rare DD spells...<P>Next topic:<P>Trakanon raid, 6 groups go in.<P>One Group is five Wizards and one Cleric... all level 57 to 60. This group will NEVER EVER see one friggin' single kill, it all goes to the five melee groups...<P>Oh yes, pretty balanced this...<P>There are haste items for Melee characters out, that increase their damage speed over 40%!!! (Fourty)<P>I am lucky that those items are out for Meleers, cuz i am not ablke to protect myself...<P>There are Weapons out that proc for more damage than Ice Comet, mana free, additional to the Melee damage. Again, i am happy that those items exist.<P>But, regarding class balance, and class balance is NOT defined thru one week raid situations, i can't contribute enough to a daily exp party. Even not with C2, it just doesn't add enough mana regen.<P>Why i have choosen the Druid example above? I want to show you once more, Absor, that we are obsolete in exp groups. There is always at least one class, that can cover our abbilities. And we are not anymoew the Masters of Damage.<BR>This is not class envy, Absor, but you have to compare the abbilities of different classes to check the class balance.<P>Last exp group i joined yesterday were Cleric CLeric, Tank, Rogue, Chanter and me (Wiz). Two CLerics in one Group, the one healed and did his job, the other.... was playing exactly like a Wiz!!!. The group level was again 57 60.<P>You see what i want to say? All we can do, other classes can do as well, or even better. If you don't give us increased damage output, we become obsolete, well we are already.<P>Only Solution can be like this:<P><BR>Lower resistance checks for our spell drastically. We are the Master of Magical Damage and Knowledge, so we should be way less resisted in daily exp group situations. Wee have only out precious mana, so let us do damage with it.<BR>Ban the damned fizzles after say... level 53. It is bad design, if a Master Wizard at level 57, 58, 59 still fizzles, this is not logical. We have not the mana to waist it.... we lack already of power in exp groups, so ban fizzles.<P>Faster mana regen:<P>Give us post 50 for each new level we reach a faster mana regen. So it would be able to adjust solo gameplay and group gameplay. As closer as we get to 60 increase the man regen even more. At level 58, 59 it is hardly possible and not fun to solo. But we need faster mana regeneration to contribute to groups.<BR>A high level rogue is at present outdamaging us, not even over time, rogues outdamage us even in the short run.<P>Increase spell damage:<P>Increasing spell damage for ALL spell 1 to 60 at 10% won't hiurt class balance at all. But we would do more damage than mages, clerics and druids who are nuking at the moment for 90% to 105% of our DD damage (depending on level). A 10 point damage advantage and a 0.1 sec faster cast time is not sufficient enough to compensate our deny for Pets, Ac, Hp, Buffs and Damage shields. At the moment we are only mages without a pet and 10 point more damage output per DD spell. (Ignoring Lures and Teleports here, but those won't get us into a daily exp group.)<P>Decrease mana cost in relation of our current level.<P>At 59 Ice Comet shouldn't be cost 400 mana, i am supposed to be a true Master of Magical damage, so reduce the mana cost for each DD spell as i level. Make Ice Comet a 320 mana cost at level 59. Druids get an Ice Comet similiar spell at level 59 for 320 mana, so fix us at thus level, please and make us at least equal to druids.<P>A greater mana pool wouldn't solve anything, excepti making us better soloer. We need a self only faster mana regen to contribute in a adequate way in high level groups. This are the only solutions to fix us.<P>Natan Magus<BR>59 Evoker<BR>Mith Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, I'd like to correct a possible misconception:<P>Wizard damage output is just fine except for SoV ubermobs.<P>This is patently WRONG.  Our damage output even against the average lvl 50+ mob in PoG is pathetic.  Our DD just doesn't scale very well.  Period.  Plane Jane mobs at the high levels usually have 8k+ hp (more than that in SoV).  In constant pull groups we just can't pull our own weight.<P>To use Verant's terminology, there is no "compelling reason" to want a wizard in a group (unless they need a port, and then after the port they don't need us).  Based on your own standards of balance (i.e., there should be a compelling reason to play each class), there is no compelling reason to play a wizard.<P>FIX OUR DAMAGE OUTPUT!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>since we are on a new page let me summarize some of the problems...<P>1. AE needs to be fixe for pre-50 spells, esp alkabor line to make them more mana efficient. Rain spells need to be fixed to do the correct number of waves OR to be made less resistant. Definately need to remove pets from the equation on Non-pvp servers.<P>2. There aren't the same number of magic/fire/cold based damage spells at every level, nor is there a magic one at level 60.<P>3. Wizards run out of mana too quickly, and then is subjected to long waiting meding. There needs to be a better way to replentish mana. Harvest and manaskin were great but they aren't enough.<P>4. The mobs in SoV have too much HPs for Wizards and there needs to be something done for wizards to compensate. This could be from a new line of percentage spells, from fast damage, low damage, low agro spells that cost low mana, or Faster mana regens or some way to regain mana. AE dmg shield may help too.<P>5. Wizards do alot of damage in a short time, but in long battles they are useless, causing us to be turned down for some of the new SoV groups.<P>6. Gaze line of spells don't really see more, A great suggestion was the use of alternate point of reference for clipping plane fixed like eye of zomm.<P>7. Gates are lacking to few places, namely everfrost or near qeynos. Karnak ports to places like warsilk woods are non existant.<P>8. Very little wizard specific or defining gear, most of the casters get lumped together except necros in terms of equipment and wizards ignored for the most part.<P>9. There is still something wrong with resists, a fire goblin should not be resisting ice comet, especially when it is 20 levels lower.<P>10. The pointy hat...<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor-<BR>I actually have to say that you've did a pretty good job on wizards. I really like our spells, I love what you addded in Kunark but here is some things that you need to take into consideration. <BR>1) Damage over time is just not there for a wizard. This is even more apparent in SoV. This is part of the reason why wizard can never get in a group. They just can't deliver damage over a long period of time. That's is what a wizard is suppose to do. We don't buff, we don't heal, we don't tank, we don't have pets, we're suppose to do damage. You have given us great spell IMO to deliver damage but you haven't given us the means to use them. <P>Solution: Increase the mana regen on wizards as they increase in levels. If you let us med faster then you don't need to do anything else. Are spells are great but we are always waiting to use them. This solution is SIMPLE and it's the single biggest problem with Wizards. Let us use the goods and make wizards desirable again.<P>2) Spells: I think that you guys have did a pretty good job on these. But there are some things that I would like to see. <P>a) Why don't we get a high lvl MR spell like Sunstrike and Ice spear? I just find it strange.<P>b) Why don't we get a upgrade in the lure series for fire and magic? Lure of Ice is a great spell but is very limited.<P>c) Shield of Magi, Manasink, and Atol's fizzle way too much. Please look into these. <P>d) O'keil's is a joke and a buff. Take it out of the game for wizards. It was a mistake in Beta and doesn't need to be in the game. It's nothing but a distraction for the class.<P>e) Rain spell are great damage to mana ratio when they work. Not going to go into detail on this one because there is a million post already on this topic. But please fix it.<P>f) WK port is a joke. Please move it to the other side of the zone. <P>g) Concussion: Great spell and I don't even mind that it's hard to get. But please let it work like a lure spell. It gets resisted on every high level mob in the game and I swear it adds taunt. <P>h) Harvest: I think you realized that we need to regen mana faster with this spell. But 300 mana at lvl 60? Come on that's not even enough to cast a lure. If you made the simple solution and made wizards med faster. YOU COULD GET RID OF THIS SPELL. I know I wouldn't complain about getting to mem 8 spells again. <P>i) I don't even want to talk about the Al'Kabor line of spells. Get rid of them, they are all useless in every practical sense. I tried using them in every way and still haven't found a use. Give me the upgrades in the lure line and get rid of all these spells.<P>j) SF evac are you for real and I thought CT was a death trap. Nothing like evacing from a zone into more danger. <P>k) Tishan's and Markar's should work anywhere and not just in a Kunark dungeon. This only helps speed up the travel time of the game. It helps everyone in the game out and makes people happier not having to run so much. <P>IMO you could make the wizard class very balanced by just doing one simple thing. You don't need to make our spells hit harder, you don't have to give us more buffs, you don't have to give us pets, just simply allow us to med faster. The solution is simple it's just up to you to fix it.<P>Kriket the Arcane<BR>Lvl 60 E`Marr<BR>Da`kor <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wizard energized weapons:  Excellent idea. <P>It should be cast on group members only, like invisiblity.  Make it cost a nominal mana cost for the initial cast, and require a constant, very low-level mana drain on the grouped wizard. The mana cost to maintain this effect should be so low that a medding wizard will be able to increase his manna (slowly) inspite of the maintenance cost of the weapon.  If the wizard leaves the group, the energy effect leaves the weapon.

</FONT><HR>Absor, I really hope you are reading this new thread as well...this is my first post in many months, and I hope I am heard.<P>I haven't read all the posts in any of the three Wizard threads, there are just too many.  I think everything that can possibly be said has been said though.  What I want to say comes down to just one simple sentence...<P>There is NO COMPELLING REASON to play a wizard.<BR>  <BR>There is nothing that we can do that another caster can't do almost as well.  Yes, we have slightly better damage to mana ratios, slightly better casting times, and portals/evacs.  The list of things we have given up in order to have this slight advantage is long, and well established.  Take Level 44 for example...our primary spell is Conflagration which deals from 606 to 625 damage based on level.  By comparison, Enchanters deal 508 to 525, Necros deal 494 to 500 and have a DOT that deals 690 plus debuffing effects.  Magicians can deal 580 to 600, (which is direct, not a bolt), and they have a combination DD and DOT spell that deals 600.  Where in this do you perceive an advantage to Wizards that compensates them for not having a pet, or a debuff, or party friendly buffs.<P>The worst thing about this situation is that I doubt you can do anything about it.  The Wizard class requires major revamping, and EQ is far too entrenched in its current setup for that to occur.  We should have been MUCH better at DD spells than the other classes.  Take the Cleric for example (since they are up for discussion as well).  They receive Superior Healing a full 19 levels ahead of the other priest classes, and that defines the Cleric as a master of healing.  All the original defining abilities of the Wizard class have proven to be false.  Therein lies the biggest problem of class balance that Wizards face...we aren't the masters of anything.<P>You can't increase our mana pool, neither can you increase the damage we deal without changing the balance of player vs. monster encounters.  I hope you find a solution, I really do.  Maybe allowing criticals is the best solution, who knows.  I will continue to play EQ for the months to come, because there are a lot of things you have done very well, but I am disappointed with what my chosen class has become...or rather never actually became.<P>There is NO COMPELLING REASON to play a wizard.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I just lost an extremely detailed and lengthy post due to last thread being closed. Don't have the energy to repeat it entirely.<P>Just wanted to state the biggest balance issue has to do with DD equalization among all classes, particularly at 44th and 54th, as Alavair mentions above (for 44th). If you do the comparisons with all casting classes at 54th you will see the same thing. All casting classes doing extremely similar damage, for virtually the same mana, and just with various casting times and a few classes having some slight hold delays. This is not adequate balance given the two huge things wizards give up to be masters of DD. Pets & Healing.<P>We do not want pets or healing, but we do want our DDs balanced with our narrow focus in mind. Our DDs MUST do more damage across the board, and particularly on our 51+ draught line in order for the classes to be balanced. We want to be able to do subsantially more damage to foes than other casters. Having a cleric DD do the same damage is unacceptable even with twice the cast time and a few second hold time. This does NOT balance having a heal spell which can heal 3000+ damage for 400 mana. Having a spell which casts 1 second faster than a druid for a miniscule mana/damage ratio improvement does NOT compensate for their being able to heal their comrades for 600 damage at the same level, in addition to all the support buffs, evacs, regeneration, damage shields, etc.<P>Our DDs are the fundamental issue of class balance. They are inadequate. Yes, I can revert back to Ice Comet for a bigger single blast, this is not acceptable given it goes back to a poorer ratio of mana/damage. In the 51+ game the draughts are our bread and butter DD and they should be substantially more powerful than other casters, not virtually the same. In many long dungeon fights I am casting only 1 or 2 DDs per foe in order to maintain mana for an emergency burndown. In those situations a cleric or druid or shaman or enchanter can do exactly as much damage as I can, and virtually as efficienty. And being able to burn up all your mana very quickly to hurt a single foe (in Kunark) and barely scratch some foes (in Velious) is also unacceptable.<P>Rains are a good potential group-friendly alternative to doing more damage to a single target for less mana. These are really only useful in groups, so I love these spells. But for rains, the resist rates MUST be looked into. These spells definitely have a resist bonus vs. DDs or at the very least we don't get our wizard bonus to foe's saving against our damage spells with them. Whereas I almost never have more than a single DD resist on regular foes, it is the norm to have 1 wave of a rain resisted, often 2 waves, and sometimes 3. This makes them almost identical mana/damage ratio as DD, but with longer cast time and a hold time.<P>We want to be damage dealers above other classes, and particularly above healing classes. That's the most important balance issue. There are clerics at my level who have 930 AC to my 567 AC, they can use their pet hammer and chain-stuns to kill a blue-con foe with half the mana it would take me. I do not ask that you nerf any other classes, you guys put out these ridiculously powerful DD spells to all casting classes already and it's too late to take them away. But ours need to be made more powerful accordingly. DD damage has become far too cheap a commodity.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Not Balanced in the group game.<P>This was the information you were looking for, I gather?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Several decent solutions have popped up. Personally, I think the class will forever be a weak participant in a dungeon-crawl group, given the typically high rate of pulls in such groups, along with the wizard's fixed rate of damage output (which is lower than that of a continuously-fighting tank or pet, facilitated via Complete Heal and Mez). <P>At this point all you can do is fix a couple things that are broken. For example, Concussion is an extremely valuable resource for a wizard who needs to chain nuke. Should have been in-game from the beginning. Drop it to a purchaseable lv 20 spell, and add an upgrade that is quest only if you like. The percent-of-total-current-HP nuke is a great idea too. <P>Anyway, happy Wednesday to ye all!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Simryd L'Drael<BR>Wizard of Quellious, Saryrn<BR>46th season</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Spell idea for the "Gaze" line:<P>My suggestion would go hand in hand with the wizard definition: seeker of knowledge. My idea is to create a line of spell that will give information on monsters. Like a "scan" spell. Each version of the spell as level increase would give slightly more information and/or have more chance on landing and/or giving the right information. This spell could help wizards in knowing when to use their multi-flavored DDs, Lures, AEs. i.e. Description that could be given to the wizard after the spell is casted on a monster: This monster appears to be breathing out cold air. This description could become standard for that case for all monster with the same stats which would create a small list of possible description hinting on the strong resist and weakness of a monster. Of course a barrier could be put against monsters that you do not wish to reveal any information. This description could be also used when your spell fail to deliver any information. This way wizards would come to learn their foe and would be very valuable to their group.<P>Seiryu</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've got a few gripes as a Wizard that I think everyone has pretty well covered here...Mainly lack of use in groups/use of mana as our only resource.<P>One thing I would like clarifying though is why we dont get an upgrade to Level 12 Resistant sking shielding spell ? It seems weird especially for the 2 reasons :<P>1. we are supposed to be master of defence *cough*<BR>2. Elemental shield (level 20 fire * cold buff) gets an upgrade to a lvl 44 spell elemental armour...<P>Weird.<P>If Verant is supposed to be making grouping more attractive to all classes THEN make the Wizards more group friendly.  I levelled mostly from 35 to 53 soloing due to the fact that I'm only on for about three hours at a time and I dont want to spent two hours begging people to take me into a group...Solo'ing is boring as hell...BUT, its more inteesting that sitting in a group sometimes where all you do is, cast, sit for a minute, standrd up for a second, cast, sit for a minute, stand up for a second, cast etc..That is of course after you've telled everyone in the dungeon for spaces in their group and been overlooked in favour of most other classes.<P>And lures - make them more mana efficient.  Otherwise again, they're *almost* a waste of space (They basically are there to make us feel likewe can contribute for a few minutes in a fight).<P>Concussion...I love it.<P>Resists...need to be looked at.  As we depend on mana solely its pretty awful when you get a full resist on something like Ice Comet...What a total waste of 2 minutes medding make me feel REALLY useful that one...but hey, the group saw me cast they might not realise it resisted  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>AE Snare ... Great.  Better than single druid/ranger snare I think as it takes a little more skill...<P>Perhaps this is what I'm really looking for...Wizards need to feel skillfull - How much skill does it take to cast, site, med etc..? Zippo.  Perhaps I should have been a chanty.<P>Sad isn't it.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>But on the bright side, I love the TP spells, concussion, pillar spells, immobolise (since the last patch) and draughts.  Harvest is good too, but I think that has massive limitations post 50...I dinged to 53 the other day and harvest didnt even add quarter of a bubb (or so it seemed)..<P>Dunxed.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok here we have Wizards, cleric's and warriors prolly the 3 most to the point classes, wizards do direct dmg, cleric's heal, and warriors do melee. Thats it you can pretty much sum those classes up  just that easy. you need to ask yourself a question are they the best at what they do.<P>Cleric's? Yes with out a doubt in my mind i can say that cleric's are by far the best, in fact they are so good VI is gonna up the healing abilities of druids and shamans because they are so far behind and cleric's are getting mad!<P>Warriors? Yes with out a doubt in my mind i'd rather have a warrior in a melee battle then anyone else. because not only can they do almost as much melee dmg as anyone else they can take it to, and they can take it better then any other class. <P>Wizards? No, Wizards can barly do more dmg then the other caster classes in a short while, in fact at a few lvls Wizards do less dmg then other classes, Druids do more dmg at lvl 57 then a wizard can and at the lower lvls very low lvl like 1 and 5 clerics and druids do more dmg at that lvl then wizards.( i know at lvl 1 and 5 it doesnt matter to much but it is the princeapal).<P>Do you see what i'm getting at? Wizards shoudl be like cleric doing so much more direct dmg then any other class VI should have to up the dmg of the other classes to compete because basicly this is the only abilty we have we give up so much for it. like pets, utilty spells, and pretty much everything but dd and ports.<P><BR>retired player<P>PS. in the guide book it says we are the masters seekers of knowledge i know this chages alot and dont know if i'm on the current role of wizards but shouldnt this mean that we either start of with a higher int bonus or have a higher int camp??</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

They use powerful spells to not only see things from afar, but to transport them there as well. This thirst for arcane knowledge has also made them the true masters of the strongest form of defense: offensive spells of pure destruction. In their ability to do magical damage, they have no rivals.<P>Then explain and defend the abov words that made me pick the class wizard and played it to lv 50 if you arent going to make it work as intended "as i got it from your decription"<BR>And dont even dare to mention "if you dont like it play another class" if that is the only solution please transfer my account to a lv 50 cleric with simalar gear please, then i atleast have a chance of grouping and feel like wanted in a group.<P>PS. Was i reading the patch message WRONG the posts for Velious are now on some vendor.

</FONT><HR>***1)***Think about a Wizard Form, wizard and druid both have similiar spells and are second to eachother like what you said, but Druids get a wolf form and it helps with faction maybe think of a form for a wizard like Dragon form(form of a drake) with effect higher resists and levitate or something. this is not envy to druids i feel we simply got shafted in the "cool" type spells which let us show off new graphics and such for example the mage new monstor pets or the shaman change form. in as many movies and such as i've seen about a wizard they could change to a dragon form<BR>2) Think about changing the level 59 spell Flaming sword of xuzl as i cannot think of a use for it since it creates a pet not superior or balanced in anyway to other class pets, and doesn't really have any use at the level its acheived.<BR>2) Maybe have wizard snare altered so that it can not snare the caster (if this means changing it from aoe to single, then its not worth it ofcoarse)<BR>if verant is actually considering these changes then two thumbs up, ive been noticing alot of patches that have made me happy lately.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well before I mention anything else might I make one suggestion in light of the patch message this morning concerning wiz spells on merchants.  I will put this as nicely as possible.  Since we have time and again seen it said that thing are there and/or working as intended, I would like to suggest we do this first off before this conversation continues,  Go to the design, spell, and epic quest team and have them in precise terms tell you how these areas in connection wizards are supposed to work. What is a Wizard's unique and defining role in the world of Norrath as a whole and specificly group situations.  Where is the payoff for the early weakness inherient(sp) to the wizard. Then roll one up on a live server and make sure they do in fact work that way.  With all of the "well it's there and it's working as intended" posts I have seen in my 16 months in game it would not surprise me in the least that some of our spells and abilities are not working on the live servers they way they are intended.  Then and only then will we have a starting point to judge just how far out of balance we are.<P>I would also like to commend you on your efforts Absor.  It cannot be easy facing these issues and know that it has to be you who has to go try to justify any requested changes to the design teams.  <P>Will post more later but really think it is important to have a common pool of factual information before progess towards and end can be made.<P>Thnx for your attention<BR>Forge ahead lord Absor your task is an urgent and important one.<P>Glenwall Gnoltrainer<BR>Lvl 54 Wiz Innoruuk<BR>Skinny Wiz of the Pantheon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Well, I have played a wizard for well over a year now and recently quit playing him.  Part of my quitting the wizard was because of the high level politics on my server and the other and biggest part was because in comparison to most classes I felt obsolete.  I am not going to say how much better so and so class is than a wizard, I am just going to suggest a few changes for the class that might help bring fun and effectiveness back to the class.  <P>1) Mana is the biggest problem with a wizard.  When you are out of mana, you have 0 use to the group.  This running out of mana problem should not happen unless you are soloing or fighting one of the bigger mobs.  The solution I propose to this is that you give wizards a spell which is like a dot, but rather than having a fixed amount of damage to the spell, it does damage over time as long as the wizard has mana.  What I am saying here is rather than casting a dot, like splurt for example, which takes mana up front and does damage until it has done the amount it is allowed, this spell would rather cost 0 mana to cast and over time it would drain the wizard's mana pool as it does damage to a mob.  There are many possibilities with this spell, like having it do more damage as the wizard runs low on mana, or vice versa or even giving a fixed amount of damage per mana point taken.  The downfall to casting this spell would have to be something drastic like making the spell wear off if the wizard moves in any way whatsoever for balancing reasons.  But adding a spell like this for wizards would fix the problem with running out of mana on the big mobs in the game because they would slowly be doing damage to the mob as the entire fight goes on, rather than just dumping mana into him within the first 3-5 minutes.  I'm not going to go into what I think the numbers for mana/damage on this spell should be because I do not know what would be balancing, all I will suggest is that my wizard can dish out roughly 6-8k of damage when full med depending on resists.<P>2) Druid roots are now better than wizard roots since you put in the patch to fix them.  This may not be all in truth, but my entire career as a wizard I have been next to a druid and his roots will outlast mine in any circumstance almost 99% of the time.  The second problem with root is that my level 4 root works better than any of the roots from there to 49.  To fix this, simply add a minimum amount of time a mob can be rooted based on the level of the spell.<P>3) A lot of people complain about Cazic gate, but I don't think the real problem they have with it is that it is unsafe, more along the lines that you gate in there at say 50+ and you can get anywhere from 1 to 10 green mobs agro on you that should be running in fear when they see you.<P>4) Rain spells, take pets out of the equation and you have them fixed.<P>5) As for the pet spell that you gave us, in my opinion it is completely useless. Although I am not high enough level to cast the spell, I have friends who are high enough and seen it used and honestly it is a waste of 700 mana, not to mention the only conjuration spell "worth" using as a wizard.<P>6) Wizards with a single target snare?  Leave that to the druids.<P>7) As for wizards taking damage and their agro, concussion was a good idea, but remove the line of spells that deal with sight or whatever they are and add in a line of concussion spells that get better as they go up in levels.  <P>Anyway, these are just things off the top of my head.<P>Thanks for your time,<P>Gal<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
