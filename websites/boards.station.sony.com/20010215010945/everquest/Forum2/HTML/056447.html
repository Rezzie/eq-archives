Keep in mind that these ‘talks’ are geared toward making sure that the classes are ‘balanced’. Please work toward that goal when posting (yes, even if that means you suggest a ‘nerf’). But I’m also interested in hearing about bugs and such too, I’m just not going to focus on them.<P>Here are the notes that I already have. Keep in mind that these are only my notes, and just because I’ve listed something does NOT mean that I like the idea or that the designers are working on making changes based on these notes. This is just what it is, a list of ideas. I’ve also added my notes to you all under the header of Note:<P>AoE spells: Mentioned elsewhere… (earlier on my list, probably under mages: basically the idea here is that maybe pets should be removed from the equation).<P>Gaze/Glimpse: Due to the clipping plane, these spells don’t really allow further seeing, just zooming in (which makes your resolution worse anyhow).<P>Note: this may not be ‘fixable’ at all due to the way the game works. It’s not like we can force your PC into a higher resolution when you use this spell…<P>Fade/Shadowstep/Yonder: There seems to be a problem with these spells. Since they will not teleport you up, they don’t work too well in hilly terrain; because the spell only sends you a few feet (stopping when it reaches a hill or building).<P>Note: Again, this may also not be something we can change, but it’s on the list.<P>Bind Sight: Seems to cause viewer to see the target as running into walls or spinning in circles if target goes up an incline.<P>Enstill: It seems that this spell is not a more useful or more powerful root, it’s just more expensive. <P>Cazic Gate: At level spell is attained, using it will most often cause death because the caster appears amidst many aggressive monsters that /con white to them.<P>Note: We’ve actually discussed this before. If I remember correctly, the general feeling was that having a dangerous gate like this wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. But it is also still on my list.<P>Tishan’s Relocation: This spell evacuates you to a very dangerous location, a monster crossroads in the Skyfire mountains. Could the location be moved, or was it intended that this be a very dangerous evacuation spell?<P>Note: See note about Cazic Gate.<P>Concussion: A level 39 spell dropped by a creature in a location that requires a party of level 50s to handle. Should it be in such a location?<P>Icestrike effects: Graphical effect looks like fire.<P>Lightning Bolt effects: looks exactly like Fire Bolt.<P>Other lightning and cold effects: It seems that there might be other spells that have the look of fire when they should not.<P>Having just re-read this list, I see nothing at all related to actual balancing stuff. This is all nit-picky stuff about minor effects and bugs and such (with the possible exception of Area of Effect spells, changing those would certainly have an effect on class balances). So, please, try to focus on balance issues…<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well this is my first post in here. Sly I really hope you are correct! I have been watching this discussion since it started hoping to find a glimmer of hope after two years of playing a Wizard (including Beta). <BR>At this point I must agree with Grimstaff. I think he (and a few others) made some VERY logical and valid points about our class but we only got a response for two posters who didn't even address the issues at hand, only a few insults.<BR>What I find amazing is how unified the majority of us are yet we don't even get a "Yep, I see your points. I'm still discussing it with the team."<P>WHY?<P>Have any of you seen the responses the other classes are getting? They are clogging all of the prominent news site front pages to the point where they only have links to them. Ours just have links to OUR 48 pages of the discussion (oh yeah one curt reply).<P>I just really want to hear SOMETHING...ANYTHING!!<P>Well, I'm not going to beat the dead horse anymore. I just hope someone with a blue name will come and Exp res the poor thing  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Fryden<BR>Order of Light<BR>The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wow part 9 and still no response for a long time, I have read all 8 of the previous and there are lots of good ideas out there. I love my wizard, but the downtime can get frustrating. It can take me 80% to all my mana to solo a blue snow cougar @ lvl 33. Any of the ideas suggested to improve mana regen would be a definite improvement and yes I prefer to group but being a wizard it seems we have a reputation for not being good in a group. This is something I dispute at least in the pre 50 world.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well to sum up what a 1000 replies have said:<P>Wizards need to do MORE DAMAGE.<P>This can be achieved by making the spells themselves do extraordinary damage or by increasing our mana regen capabilites extremely.<P>This way we either contribute more to the group, or after contributing our meager current amount we don't sit around for 10 minutes (after fix should be around 1, or 2) to do it again.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think we are the most  passionate about our class. Most of us that play wizards have an idea of what a wizard should be from either playing one in other games or from reading. Wizards are supposed to be powerful masters of the magical forces, and well we don't really live up to that in EQ. I don't really care if we are the master seekers of knowledge, there really doesn;t seem to be a place in EQ for that ability anyway. EQ is mostly about killing things. The only thing that well help us is to increase or damage output either by upgrading the damage or upgrading our ability to use mana effectively.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've not read all 8 pages but I've played a wizard for over a year and a half, just leveled to 41 last nite. Here is my comments:<P>*more DAMAGE? at one point mages have a DD spell stronger than ours (level 34-39 i think) this should never be the case. NO other class should have a DD or AoE spell capable of doing more damage than us at the same level even if it costs them 2x the mana it does us.<P>*more DAMAGE? I learned long ago not to use my new DD's as I got them. The massive damage we can do up front in a fight will taunt a mob immediately onto us. Learning to spread out my damage conservatively during a fight came after much practice. If in a full group i'm lucky to (Stun- 34th DD - 34 DD) before it's dead. In groups of 3-4 (Stun - 34th DD - wait - Stun - 39th DD) to finish 'em off. This is the pre-50 wizard game.  <P>I'm not sure I want more damage. Less mana consumption for these spells might be nice, nothing huge.<P>Harvest has been great thus far 34-41. But, how about a lower level version, 20th, and by the time I reach 49 I'm sure to increase my mana pool considerably and Harvest will no longer be of much benefit.<P><BR>   Ndaar Bellicose<BR>   41st servant of Solusek Ro<BR>   Rodcet Nife<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Quickly now...<P>Wizards want the following things. Ready?<BR>1) To be the best at dealing damage.<BR>2) ...there is no 2.<P>Thats what we sacrafice all benefits for. We get bad AC and HP, so we cant tank. We get no heal spells so we cant heal. We get no group-mana batteries so we cant do that. What can we do? Nuke better than anyone else. Right? Err...kinda. Its a "Yes, you can...in 3.2 seconds, you can deal more damage than soandso's class...but in 3.3 seconds, they outdamage you for the rest of the fight."<P>Uzun stated that on most mobs at least one lure will have a 0% chance of failure at any lvl. This is untrue, and it SHOULD be true. It would allow us to be...awesome. One of the best and most needed classes in the game. And thats what we should be.<P>Warrior<BR>Cleric<BR>Wizard<P>Should be the ideal group. One from every segment. Its not. Not by a long shot. Wizards should be the warriors of casting. They arent.<P>Absor, you could do very little to unbalance us. Bigger mana bar? Thats going a little far...unbalancing I think. But overall, you could do very little to unbalance us based on our suggestions because we ARE unbalanced, and not for the good side of the scale either. Wizards are a very unbalanced class. They have a job in a group: Dealing insane amount of damage. They dont do this, or if they do, they do it only slightly better than soandso's class.<P>Mages have the best pets.<BR>Necros have the best life sucking death.<BR>Enchanters have the best enchantments.<BR>Wizards have the best damage...for the first fight...if it lasts only a few seconds.<P>Make every class DIFFERENT. Wizards are as of now pretty close to Mages without pets. Change it, make all of our sacrafices we give for being the best damagers WORTH IT, not only for lvl 60's but for lvl 30's as well.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I like the idea of removing damage caps off of the spells so that the damage keeps increasing as we increase in levels. We could use these for consistant damage and use the big guns in between, for emergengies, and to finish of the MOBS. Faster mana regeneration makes sense, after all we are the most mana dependent class. As for any other class related problems/ideas refer to Grimstaff's posts.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Personally, I would like to see our spells resisted much less, a new formula for mana pool determination (in other words more mana), and finally, fix the AE spells so pets are not included.<P>For a new idea, how about a 4th supercgarged mana bar, which can be used to cast unresistable, double damage spells, with bigger visual effects.  8-)  This mana bar is regened only after completely filling the regular mana bar, and of course is drained very quickly.

</FONT><HR>I was reading through a few of the other caster Talk threads and noticed the other classes are asking for everything- better pets, better nuking, better heals, EVERYTHING.<P>What makes the Wizard class unique is- we are basically asking for improvement to our basic abilities.  For example, we don't want pets, or clarity, or healing ability.  We simply want our Wizards to be what they were meant to be- masters of direct damage.<P>Looking at the numbers, we are marginally better than a mage or druid with respect to direct damage (of course without a hint of utility to offer groups).<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Not a very soloing friendly spell as you can see. But good in grps, especially one with a healer.<P>This spell line looks like a human sized funnel<BR>(you know like a tornado) but with multi-colored sparks so we look cool. Maybe it has slow casting time so we cant kite with it and the funnel goes from caster to target in an uncontrolable rage!!!<P>Maybe its percentage based for Velious, all i know is it solves our DD and grouping problem and would look dang cool. <BR>If Verant can handle the challenge of creating this affect, i'd sure like to see it. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Via class fit.<BR>Make them fit well with certain types of classes. ie they /assist the warrior and some aspect of the warrior becomes greatly enhanced.  This enhancement might last until mana is depleted.<BR>Same for any other class.  Enhance what they do best.  So a cleric heals faster/for more.<P>General note:<BR>I am absolutely serious.  The wizard is fundamentally broken at ALL levels.  The times when i would take one over a Mage are so rare as to be entirely insufficient to base a class around.<P>This means that to achive balance, the FUNDAMENTALS of the class need to be looked at.  EXACTLY the same as happened for the rogue, tohugh for different reasons.<P>And yes i would freely take the sarcastic option stated above and level a druid to be aporter instead.

More damage over time.<P>I dont want a bigger boom, because I can't handle the aggro of the booms I have now!  If I get say a 500 pt dd at level 34, and I cast it when the mob is half-dead, it should die right?  What happens if I get resisted?  The mob will aggro on me and then I will be dead.<P>So, if you are going to change the damage spells do, Wizard spells should be inherently less aggro than all other caster spells, and have a much last chance of resists.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>While I completely agree with most of the posts above (Specially Grimstaff's, of course hehe), the ones about a wizard able to wade into the thick of battle and melee effectively wouldn't and shouldn't work (In my opinion =). <P>First off, have you tried to melee for kicks? Mobs tend to ignore the tanks and go after the low HP (or AC perhaps, not sure exactly what their coding is) person trying to hit them. We would need completely new armor with AC plus defensive skills (dodge don't cut it) and hp to consider standing in the thick of things. <P>Also, we'd need a large amount of weapons flagged to allow wizards' use of them. <P>Not to mention people telling us to sit our asses down and med or leave the group (providing you get in one =P). <P>Lastly, I rather prefer the idea of the weak and frail (physically) wizard, though ultimately quite superior in power to anyone else (at ending levels of game that is... Let the difficult levels earlier weed out the weak ones).<P><BR>On a completely different tack, here's my suggestion for a spell that'd provide us at least a small amount of grouping ability.<P>Have a spell that you cast on a group member and the weapon they're wielding would proc. I'm unaware of any 'mega' procs that would unbalance this (excluding uber weapons which could be immune to the spell). The mana cost would have to be low for it to be mana efficient (consider yak proccing for 75 dmg), so I'm thinking around 25 mana. The recast time would be 30 seconds or so, so it couldn't just be chain cast.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wizards are being vocal for a reason. I have played most of the classes some (few past mid levels). The only class, in my epxerience, that has *serious* balance problems is wizard. The overall upgrading of everything else in the game has slowly nerfed wizards far behind other classes. Wizards are a specialized class, but their only skill is fairly closely matched by all caster classes. Niche class should always be worth 2 or more unspecialized classes on their own field (1 warrior tanking is not worse than 2 hybrids, 1 cleric not worse than a druid and shaman). This is not the case here, and there is nothing to compensate for that, or the fact that mobs have been tuned up while spell damage is not.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wizards should always regen mana at meditation levels without having to actually med.<P>They should then give us some interesting non-mana abilties (either interesting weapons, procing weapons, activatable items) that we can use during a battle when we run oom or want to conserve mana.<P>This would make us not useless during that epic fight when we run oom...we could instead grab a wand of magic missiles (for example) and start  blasting away (not major damage...less than a pet but enough to be more than token damage).  Since we're continuously regenning mana we can unload in a big way once we're full again.<P>Might also ease the impression a lot of people have of us as a parasite when all they see is us sitting on our butts most of the time contributing no visible damage.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wizard issues have been gone over forever.  I'm really only reiterating what I think is the #1 problem because there have been all these wonderful fixes for just about every class BUT the one that has the biggest room to complain.<P>What are Wizards good for in a fight?  Damage.  Verant says "fast damage" but I think we've basically already dispelled that little falsehood (nobody is treating that opinion with any respect, even as a courtesy).  When the absolute maximum damage output of a Wizard against a given mob from fm to no mana is 12000, this stops sounding significant.  The giants in Kael are certainly not impressed.  Got a Kael train?  Knock one giant's health in half, woot.<P>Okay, so in a fight, we do _damage_.  Direct damage.  AE's are a fun toy in a couple of non-SoV scenarios, so shut up about them, please.  What's wrong with the damage we do?  It works out to the lowest damage per minute of any class (save enchanters / clerics, who have specialized and far more critical jobs).  It's the irony of that predicament that blows a high level Wizard away the day he realizes it.  **Here he's playing a class whose JOB is to do DAMAGE, and he does it worse than EVERYONE.**<P>THAT'S what Verant has got to fix.  NO, not by giving Wizards an honest-to-goodness pet.  Not by giving them a spell that does 3000 damage for 200 mana but has zero chance of landing (I can see that little "solution" from a mile away).  Not, for Christ's sake, by putting an ultra rare drop on the hardest mob in the game and letting two or three people per year obtain it.<P>So what's the problem?  The problem is that Verant has been digging this little grave for years and, in much the same fashion as they were complaining that the Donal's BP would eventually ruin the game, their mob hp progression and refusal to address how that affects a Wizard's job security has ultimately made them a fine little mess that, from where I'm standing, they may not be capable of fixing at all!  On the other hand, they don't exactly have a track record that suggests to me they have any SUCH plans, so it's all moot.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I hope Im right to  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Right now its 5 AM, and I just woke up.  I usually do ALL of my best thinking when Im taking a shower.  And boy did I come up with a doozie  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Change harvest completely, or add a new SKILL, now spell.  Make it last 2 minutes and have a refresh time of 3 minutes.  During the 2 minute period it lasts, reduce the mana of our direct damage spells BY THE AMOUNT OF GROUP MEMBERS. examples:<BR>solo: spells cost full base mana cost<BR>2 man group: spells cost 80%<BR>3 man: 60%<BR>4 man: 40%<BR>5 man: 20%<BR>and for 6 man since I cant advocate FREE blasting, make our spells stay at 20% but allow them the chance to "critical strike" for up to double damage.  Ive heard someone from verant say that "I wouldnt think wizards would want to do that much damage due to aggro" or something like that.  Hehe, well thats why I have Concussion memmed at all times  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  As it is now, it really isnt useful unless you blast too early in fights.  If my idea were implemented, it would allow us to nuke through the course of the fight, and make possible the critical nukes without getting the life smacked out of us  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  Just a thought.<P>P.S. I based my idea off the fact that specialization can lower the mana cost for different types of spells, so I think that it would be possible to code in a skill that acts like a "super spec"  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  Not sure if it is possible, but out be nice.<P>Syndrome, evoker of Skyre Draneth in the world of brell serilis</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This class has been exceptionally weak since Beta.<P>It was tough getting a group back in mid-99, even when melee damage wasn't so vastly overpowered.<P>Absor told us to be patient.  Well, this class has not been balanced for nearly two years now.  I think we've been pretty patient!<P>I don't see how people at Verant can look at the numbers and tell us we are balanced.<P>I don't see how they can be so protective about the cleric's place in groups while totally blowing us off for so long.<P>I don't see how they can make the class so weak already and then give us ridiculously hard quests.<P>If there isn't a prejudice against wizards in the tuning team, there is at least something here they need to come clean about.<P>I'm happy for the wizards who have camped Jboots(and don't mind 5-10 min of downtime between solo kills) or those who have a steady group to join.  But I hope Verant hasn't based their "balance" decisions on those rare few.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Im starting to think that Verant doesnt have a clue how to fix us.<P>Menny greate ides have arrised from the players here, just hoping someone at Verant is looking at it.<P>One thing dont know if its realy a balance issue, but ill give it a try anyway.<P>I was thinking about my epic weapon yesterday, and i havent started of doing it yet, becuse the only thing i feel atracted to in that weapon is the stats on it. I was hopeing for a nice DD on it, but i guess that would have made us unbalanced in Verants eyes. But i have another ide of it, why not make the effect on the weapon party gate to wiz bind point. Im sure the codeing culd fix so if you need a key to get into the zone that a wiz is bound , it would work as the velious gates.<P>And just to comment a respons from another thread that i saw, that started me thinking.<BR>--- Didnt find the orignal posting so i trying to sum it up.<P>It was in a talk about clerics geting worse becuse of druids and shamans getting SHeal earlyer. There was a comment about clerics nuke kind of the same mana/dmg ratio of icecommet.<BR>The response was that: so its 6 levels after the wiz.<BR>Well give me CH 6 levels after the cleric then, sounds balancing to me =)<P>/em is sorry for all the typos, dont live in US<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>T6N6T, just a point i want to bring up to you and anyone else that wants the "Wizard group gate to bind" spell.<P>My Wizard is a Dark Elf and as most players know we're not that well liked in most areas so if by chance i was bound at say Overthere(Evil outpost in Kunark) and was grouped with a few persons that were KOS in that city there is a chance that they would get killed gateing in there if i used that spell,qranted its a good idea but if the gater forgot where he/she were bound and that happened it would spell disaster and if I was a REALLY mean person i could offer to gate people for free and gate them into some reall ugly places like say i was bounnd right over the lava pit in Lavastorm with a levitate spell and a level 15 needed a gate all i would have to do is make sure i had levitate on and gate them there and they would die farely quick and have a VERY hard time getting there corpse.<P>I do like the idea but there is too much room for it to be abused by the wrong people.

</FONT><HR>Good morning!<P>Alas, my one night of posting has already turned me off EQ (once again).  Yes, almost 2 years of the same fight and nothing has been done, with exception of two releases furthering the demise of the Wizard class.<P>There is another reason I am done with EQ, most likely for good.  Last night, I wanted to make some plats to buy my Peridots, but the Ice Giants were over camped.  So I headed out to Rathe Mts to give Hill Giants a try.  Of course Druids were abundant and Hill Giants were few and far between, but this is great for a soloing Wizard who needs 14 minutes 30 seconds to med to full mana. (22 minutes if you need to re-buff yourself).  So I see a Hill Giant, and I click on my jboots, cast lev, blah blah blah, and my first shot at Bonds of Force, the AE snare, is completely resisted (Shackles of Atoll is still resisted 90% of the time even on green mobs).  I had enough distance to squeeze off a root, and of course it was resisted.  After some running around, I thought I could squeeze off another BoF, and it worked but broke after the first 100% resisted Ice Comet.  I added a clops to the mix and died shortly thereafter.  Lost half a bub, back down to level 51, fighting green mobs.<P>My skills have been completely maxxed out all the way through 49 at least (that's all I can 100% remember without a doubt), with exception to specialization in evocation.  So it can't be my skill levels causing all these resists.  Just 4 months ago when I was 50, I hunted Hill Giants with relative ease.  Last night was a quick reminder of how weak the Wizards are.  Full bar of mana for 2 green Hill Giants, and/or quick death from resists.<P>I'm done, again.  Dawn, 1st quarter 2001, among others.  Until the release, I will continue to write my concerns for the Wizard class here on the message boards.  Call me a dreamer, but I still would love to play the Wizards as they were meant to be played.  Maybe in the next month or 2, someone at Verant will address the long broken class (since beta!!!).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056447-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056447-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056447-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056447-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056447-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056447&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056447&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
