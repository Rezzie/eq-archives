&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>First of all, I need to apologise. I haven't read every single post in these gargantuan threads. I have tried, but its so difficult to wade through pages and pages of statistics and whining and so forth. I pity you Absor.<P>Now, onto the rest. First of all, I play a Dark Elf Shadowknight, a hair's breath away from 41st level.<P>I love my class. Its very difficult to play a Shadowknight. Its much easier to play a Warrior, or a Druid, or a Necro or a Shaman. No, I don't say that to mean that those classes don't have their own weaknesses and flaws, more that those are the other things I have tried. And by far, I find the Shadowknight the most challenging.<P>But, I played a Shadowknight first - image is all important, and there is an undeniable cool factor to the class. It disheartens me to see that some people don't understand that, and can't look beyond the technicalities. But I don't want to start that whole debate either. I suppose what I am really trying to say is, that I love my Shadowknight.<P>The Shadowknight damage ratio in regards to that of a warrior is almost laughable. I've had a warrior four levels lower than me manage to out damage me time and time again. Now I pride myself on being an excellent representative of my class. No, I am not level 60, no I don't know anything about big raids. But I have worked DAMN hard to get where I am, so I believe that my, and every other Shadowknight's concerns out there warrant attention. <P>Issues I would like to see.<P>1) Weapon Specialisation.<P>Casters have Spell School specialisation. Why can there not be weapon specialisation ? And no, I don't just mean for Shadowknights, I mean for everyone it could be an idea to consider. You have the choice of choosing a specific weapon, and as you advance in your specialisation, there would be benefits. What kind of benefits ? My mind keeps drifting towards critical shots, but I cringe at the repurcussion and balance issues of that. Perhaps more that you would miss less often, and hit more often ?<P>This would of course level out the debate of "most shadowknights use this" and blah blah. I don't appreciate someone stating what most shadowknights use. I don't know who you are, I've never seen you, and you've certainly never seen me. Do a lot of shadowknights use 1hb and a shield ? Sure thing. And why is that ? Because of the stupidly high stats on certain weapons, such as the Ebon Mace (I think thats it, its late, forgive me). Me ? I prefer to use  a sword, and a two handed sword at that. Its intimidating, its large, its powerful, and you certainly won't miss it going through your ribs. At any rate, my original point before I became side-tracked was that offering the opportunity for specialisation, would perhaps even enable the wielder of the weapon to go above "normal" skill caps for that weapon. Be it 1hs, 1hb, 2hs, or piercing. Whatever. I don't think it would be a GOOD idea for one weapon skill to be increased and another not to be. I've never used 1hb, and I never will.<P>2) Offense vs Defense.<P>In my opinion, I see a Shadowknight as "offensive" (no pun intended) and a Paladin defensive. The paladin is the healer, the defender of faith, the protector. The Shadowknight is the bringer of pain and darkness and destruction. And more than that, a Shadowknight is not designed to truly protect anyone other than themselves. The only 'other' cast spells we have are what, Dark Empathy, and the Endure/Resist Disease Cold line. I have no problem with the Defense skill increase, should it go through. But in my mind, I believe Shadowknights to be more offensively minded.<P>3) The Equipment.<P>This I think is an often made mistake. It seems that with every expansion there is more powerful armor and weapons. Yes, the foes are of a much greater level of expertise, and there are new and dangerous lands and so forth. Honestly though, I don't think rapidly improving or (shudder for saying this) nerfing equipment wholesale for class balance is a particularly good idea. I think equipment should enhance a class, not make it or break it. Does that make sense ?<P>4) Harm's Touch<P>I have noticed the resists seem to have improved, but the damage still makes me cringe in reality. Against a mob with thousands upon thousands of hit points, my harm's touch on one occasion wasn't even enough to taunt a Crawler from the wizard casting on it. 401 damage isn't that threatening. What do I think could be done to balance this ? Well, my main problem, is when I read the different formulas in regards to Harm's Touch and Lay on Hands. And it seems like we've been unfairly done by here. In no way do I think Lay on Hands should be downgraded. But it seems like a constant concern of all Shadowknights that Harm's Touch is often a token power. For a blessing from our God (despise us as he does), its not exactly earthshattering. Yes, it is handy, but I believe under-balanced in comparison to what the other classes have available. Warriors and critical blows, Wizards with endless nukes, Shamans with their DoT's, Rogues with their backstabs, and the list goes on. Is there some way that Harm's Touch could be given some dignity back perhaps. The idea of it being a damage to health converter is interesting, though even I have doubts that could be unbalancing.... I think it is honestly something to think upon. It is a constantly re-occuring issue.<P>5) Disciplines.<P>I think the Disciplines sound great as they are. And I will leave it at that. I haven't used them yet, as they aren't available.<P>6) Casting vs Hitting.<P>Mana costs, weaker spells, casting delay. Lions and tigers and bears, oh my. I like to use all of my abilities to my advantage, this includes casting of spells. Now keep in mind, at this moment, I'm not 100% sure of the exact changes on Test, and honestly, those are mostly irrelevant anyway. Its called Test Server for a reason. Just because its there doesn't mean it will be implemented. But, back to casting... I receive my spells later than my brother and sister Necromancers. Understandable, I have to devote equal time to my body and my mind. As such, I only have a small selection of the spells available to them, and it takes me much longer to learn them whilst I am trying to learn my sword-craft as well. But why should it cost me more mana ? Perhaps my spells might lack the strength of my brethren.. understandable once more, I do not spend the time they do upon casting,because I need skills for battle, for melee. So why wouldn't, in being less powerful, existing later, would my spells not take less time to cast ?<P>I don't know, I suppose I'm trying to tack on a RP motivated rationale there, but honestly, why would I essentially stab myself in the foot by using the lesser damage of a spell, when I can instead poke something in the chest twice with my sword in that amount of time ?<P><BR>7) Miscellaneous.<P>Kick. I don't think its necessary. I wouldn't like to see an add on of a whole different plethora of skills, I would like to see an improvement upon the current lot of skills. Be it in their "cap" level, or their implementation (see Specialisation  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> ). <P>Faction : Part of the joy of being a Shadowknight. Don't cry about the lack of faction. Who wants to enter those weak good cities anyway ?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> And its not impossible to raise faction, should you so desire. I did it accidentally in Highpass. The guards regard me warmly. Dark Elf who worships Innoruuk. And REALLY hates Orcs. <P>DarkForge: I agree. Cazic is a nasty place, and grouping and trying to even find all of the pieces of decaying is just absolutely horrible. At level 40, all I have managed to get is multiple sets of bracers. I have the melatite, I have my militia helms and my Qeynos shield. Its the decayed that keeps avoiding me. Is there even a chance of this being evaluated ?<P><BR>Overall, I'm happy these discussions are ongoing. And whilst I love my class, I wouldn't complain if there were some little tweaks here and there. <P>Amarantha Draculesti<BR>40th Shadowknight of Innoruuk<BR>Drizzul Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Balancing Shadow Knights seems easy to me...we are Anti-Paladins, therefor  if you raise the Paladins defense skill to that of Warriors you have to do it for us also. or the oposite..offense egual to warriors.<P>All in all we are still fighters, not casters.

</FONT><HR>I play a 29th LVL Erudite SK on Rodcet Nife.<BR>I have to saw of all the character classes I tried, I like this one the most. I rarely moan about what SK's don't have. I am trying to find the things we do better than others and use thme to my advantage (in undead zones I rock!).<BR>I think the recent improvements to the class helped a lot. I personally find playing a little easier.<BR>There is one gaping hole in our design that I hope will get addressed someday soon:<BR>If you are not a Troll or Ogre SK, using 2H slash weapons (so loved by SKs) will forever doom us to casters frying us up! Either create better mid-level 1H Slash weapons so we can use a sheild to bash (there by having the ability to disrupt spells and deal a little extra damage) or give us Kick. The Kick skill should be made avialble around level 22, just about the time we start to afford discent 2H slash weapons.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR> I agree , I also do not understand how we can be the Knights of death and destruction being defensive ? You can cause death and destruction without fighting ? Of all the hybrid classes The sk should be second to only warriors to melee. Heh a ranger who is the defender of the forest with more offensive capabilities of an sk ? strange . Sounds like these two classes are mixed up. <P> On a side note. If you dont want to change it. Lets talk about the defensive abilities of the Sk. We dont get the armors. we dont get the defensive skill caped high. We dont get any defensive disciplines. In fact if we look at 90 percent of our major spells against mobs. Its all based on damage. Not Defense. So kinda of a double standard there. Please give us more skills on the defensive side, if you dont think that a Death knight should be a major fighting class.  Give us a couple defensive disciplines. ( good defensive diciplines please not some discipline thats been knocked down alot like our pets or our spells. Seems we get alot of knocked down versions of second hand skills. ) <P><BR> Quest . Please give more class defining quests.  And some quests that are no drop for sk only. Its always hard to do quests when everyone in the game is competing with you that arent even in your class trying to get the same items. ( ie. darkforge items, sould leech off cazik ). Speaking of our epic. Why oh why did you make the quest based off an item that others would use also.? The soul leach itself is rare item. Top it off. We have to fight with warriors to get that item. Hello ? Then to make the quest item lootable ? OMG..<P><BR> OK enough of that TO recap <P> Better defensive skills . <BR>    Higher cap on dodge, Parry , Defense, Taunt<BR> <BR> Give us a couple defensive disciplines. <BR>     Not like a warrior discipline nerfed please<BR>     ( we have enough second hand skills )<P> Give us more class defining quests . <BR>    ( some no drop - sk only quest )<P> Or make us melee heavy . We are death knights .<BR>     Please rethink this . Think your vision has <BR>     changed on our rolls. <P> Pets are cool . Keep them . Upgrade one class for each spell<P> Better life taps, Or a undead regeneration ability .. spell..<P> YOu know the more i think of it . If we had a spell or skill like Undear regeneration . That would be terrific. Class difining ability. Give it like a regen rate of a regen spell with a level advancment to increse more regen. Recharge in 30 min.  Nice. Maby that would be part of the Undead form spell or ability that you can put out. <P> Ok .. thats enough for now.

</FONT><HR>Well if they want us to use 2 handers instead of Sword and Shield give us a reason to carry one.<BR>The best solution for that would to give us the ability to get Crit. Hits with 2 hand weapons!<P>Give Paladins the ability to get Crits with Shields (maybe have the Bash do equil of a Force spell of something). This way both class's would get increased damage output, but not so much as to infringe on Warriors and add a bit of flavour to the class's.<P>I would hate it if it ended up that the only difference between Paladins and Shadow Knights<BR>was the colour of the armour and the line up of pells they could cast.<P>One point on the pets too, the problem is they gave us pets (for the first 50 levels) based on a Necromancers pet of half our levels (aprox).<P>This lead's to progessivly worse pets up to 50 and is only improved with the post 50 pets. What they sould have done was given us pets that are for necro's 10 to 15 levels below us throughout our carreer. This would give us more usefull pets without making us Necro's wearing plate.<P>Look at our pet list<BR>9 = 4 (5 lvl Under)<BR>15 = 8 (-7 lvl's)<BR>22 = 12 (-10 lvl's)<BR>30 = 16 (-14 lvl's)<BR>39 = 20 (-19 lvl's)<BR>49 = 29 (-20 lvl's)<BR>52 = 39 (-13 lvl's)<BR>57 = 44 (-13 lvl's)<P>I think most would agree the 50+ pets are fine and the early ones are ok and work as intended (basicly a fire and forget dot) but the 39 and 49 pets are just to low to even score a hit on blues they you are fighting at this level to gain EXP.<BR>These two should be raised to the 24 and 34 Necro pets, not a huge increase but enough to at least give the pet a chance to aid its master in battle and not just fill your speakers with it's silly laugh.<P>Jusr my 2 cp<P>Naele Shadowslayer<BR>40th lvl Shadowknight<BR>E Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I hope VI ids really listening about this. Because for the amount of actual SK's playing the game, i think they have all posted at some point. I already posted my opnion so no need to go BACK into that, but i will say this.. the fact that this discussion is now 5+ parts long shows that VI really has no idea about SK's in general. I really hope they take time to get this right eather than rushing into something. Oh and BTW...<P>The changes on the test server are NOT enough. We need better pets, higher damage output, Maybe giving us so un-nerfed, or unlowered spells would help. I mean if we got even ONE necro offensive spell that was even with their lvl we would be alot more useful. Let me set up a common SK spell casting problem.<P>I pull MOB X with darkness<BR>Ranger/druid cats snare.<BR>"Your XXXdarkness spell has wore off"<BR>I cast a DOT XXXXblood<BR>Necro in group casts how he normaly would(better dot)<BR>"Your XXXXblood spell has worn off"<P>At this point i am being beat on because i keep trying to get a spell to stick that someone dosent have a better version of, probably about 1 bulb of HP at this point. This irratating pattern goes on for a bit of time, as soon as healers are close to OOM i become a low priority heal because i can't compete in damage, OR tanking ability. <BR>"XXXX begins casting feign death"<P>AT this point, an ideal situation would be for SOMEONE to slip me a heal so i can get up and continue to do at least a little bit of damage, that never happends though. Soon after this the party is killed, and i am left laying on the ground, an i hear...<BR>"You A$#%^$* why did you feign death, we all died because of you!!"<BR>At this point you see a shout "lvlXX enchanter/tank/healer LFG."<P>If i dont have any friends or guildmates in the group you can imagine what happends next.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok I thought Id throw my 2 cents worth in here.I have read alot of things in these post and som I agree with and some I do not.<P>-Do not agree with uping pets. Haste will help them all so thats good but other then that no.<P>-Agree with bash skill upped. <P>-Weapon skill raised to warrior status. This i belive should happen but only on 1 class of weapon. That is a GREAT IDEA!! Warriors can pick up any waepon and be great. We are Knights is some form of the word  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">. Why can we not be as good as a warrior with at least 1 weapon class?<P>-More 2H with bash enabled. Sounds good to me but some large races will disagree with that. Easy fix. If a person that normal has a slam ablitiy uses a shield or a bash enabeled weapon they should get a bonus. This bonus could be a couple points of damage or a little higher percentage to actualy stunning  a mob or even a longer duration stun.<P>-higer defence cap . YES!!!!!!!!!!<P>-The spells. Well this couold take all day and I havent fully researched it all. I do not like the delays on the spells since we are in combat. There has to be something that allows us a better chance of using them. Faster cast time and a longer reset time might work (regaining concentration or something). This would stop the  constant casting (over powered) Yet we would have a better chance of getting it off.<P>-What I would like aslo is a form of constant aura. That effects every one in the party. It cant be dispelled and stacks with everything even the same auras. Its something that gets better with lv or every 5 lvs.  Its a aura of dedication. Paladins/Sk's/Rangers should all get one and it wont do much but it helps. Something like adds 1 to ac and  + to saves or attributes  or attack or resist certain spells at  certain lvs (like after a while you cant root a ranger, fear a Sk or diease a  paladin or something but it works for the whole group) . depends what ever class will have something diffrent. This will help in groups and even against uber mobs. I mean if it stacks with every thing that can only be a bonus no mater how little it is.<P>Well thats all the time I have for now. I realy Hope someone at vereant reads this and gives a answer. That would acctualy make my day  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Thanks <BR>4N<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>After some thought, I think I know why shadowknights are considered a 'defensive' class. There are already too many 'offensive' classes in the game. I suppose it makes some sense being a plate wearing class, but anyway...<P>Someone earlier made an excellent point. If shadowknights are considered a defensive class, then why don't we have a defensive discipline?<P>After reading your (Alan's) post, it seems that you are reluctant to add new disciplines to the hybrids. If this is true, then that leaves us with modifying one of our other disciplines. A number of suggestions have been posted here, some good, some impractical. Perhaps if you were to list some limitations, the SK community could focus more on coming up with an acceptable alternative.<P>I myself am quite pleased with the majority of the changes being pursued on test. However, there are a few things.<P>Grim aura: At 22, 5 ATK is barely noticeable. Also, if I'm not mistaken, don't rangers get firefist at 22? Granted they are a more offensive class, but still. I'd rather see this spell replaced with scent of dusk/shadow. If paladins are meant to heal and buff, shouldn't SK's be meant to deal damage and debuff?<P>Lifetaps/Casting time: I think I have a hunch why the development team is against the 'lifetap-DoTs' and insists on giving us lifetaps instead. I think the dev team is planning on there being a fair number of interrupts, especially on the higher level ones, keeping us from chain casting. Before it was the mana multiplier to keep things balanced, now it's simply the casting time. Having a DoT, would allow us to only have to cast the spell once. To be honest, I don't really see how having lifetap-DoT's is unbalancing. I suppose the lifetaps are better in that there are no stacking issues, but the casting times are horrific. I assume that the dev team put them in as ways to lessen downtime, not as an alternative damage dealer.<P>Defensive cap increase: Excellent. Honestly though, I'd be willing to trade points here for increases in the other defense skills (parry, dodge, riposte). Increasing parry would be a great way to up our defensive abilities without raising our offensive power like increasing riposte would.<P>Bash: What happened to this one? Isn't it easier to defend with a shield? Why not increase the skill cap here?<P>Last but not least, uber raid encounters: If there's any topic that lights up the class forums anymore, this is the one. In fact, most of the changes I've proposed in this post have really been heading towards this issue. You said in the balance thread for pallies that you were reluctant to give any defensive disciplines to hybrids. Why? If that's the case, then what do YOU propose.<P>On a final note, I wanted to mention something that I don't think many people have before. Before Kunark, the big bosses were tuned (i.e. balanced) with the average level 50 class in mind. Also, there wasn't a terribly large difference between the classes in terms of power. However, with the addition of Kunark, and a max level of 60, the power of mobs scaled dramatically. For the most part so did the other classes.<P>The problem is that most of the skills (besides the disciplines) increased linearly. Against exponentially buffed mobs, the disparity is huge, especially for those without disciplines. The real unbalancing comes from the reduction of damage by percentages. i.e. 20% of 100 damage is a lot less than 20% of 500 (that's a reduction of 20 damage and 100 damage). You then compare this to, say, Leechcurse. Leechcurse is a completely linear discipline. It will always do X amount of damage and heal me X life. It doesn't SCALE with the mob like the defensive disciplines do. I hope I'm making myself clear, it's a somewhat abstract idea.<P>I'd often thought to suggest that when leechcurse is activated that we would hit 100% of the time. Well, after some thought, I don't really think that this is the solution. It still does not scale with the mob. Despite your reluctance, I'd prefer to see SK's/Pally's get one offensive and one defensive disciplines. Similar to Bards, Rangers, Rogues, Monks and Warriors.<P>Oh yes, before I forget. I noticed in the pally balance thread that you mentioned giving them full time crits against undead. While I'm all for this, you do realize that this then places shadowknights as one of the least offensive/damaging (in pure melee) classes in the game?<P>As for some random ideas of my own, I'd like to see SK's get triple attack and kick. Of course triple attack would need to be lower than a warriors as well as kick.<P>I don't see all of these changes going live but since this is a discussion board...<P>Soldara Widowmaker<BR>Ayonae Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Good. <P>There are some things I also want to be changed and I will post here what I think and want :<P>Malgorzata, I agree there should be some kind of weapon specialization. Casters can specialize in one casting skill, why can't we Tanks also specialize in a weapon skill then ? Would be fair.<P>Spells :<P>1) Remove artificially inflated mana cost for pre level 50 lifetap spells<P>Answer : Great idea, altough a bit late..<P>2) Move Spirit Tap to level 55<BR>3) Move Drain Spirit to level 57<BR>4) Add Drain Soul at level 60<P>Answer : Sounds quite good to me but how about this : Move Siphon live (51) to lvl 39, Spirit Tap to 53 or 54, Drain spirit 56 or 57 and Drain Soul to 60. I mean the Lifedraw from level 30 drains away 45 hps, this is a joke. Please give us at least Siphon live at 39 because 75 hps is more realistic for that lvl range, and at 49 we get LifeLeech which rocks =)<P>5) Grim Aura added at level 22<P>Answer : Nice idea but shouldn't it be lvl 15 ?<P>6) Move Shieldskin to level 34<P>Answer : Why lvl 34 and not 30 ?<P>7) Mini Intensify Death pet buff added at 29, 10% (min) haste 5 str 5 ac<P>Answer : This one is a great idea in my opinion =)<P>8) Add Diamondskin spell at 59<P>Answer : Really great, I see this kinda as our upgrade so we can also tank uber encounters a little bit better, except Peridot is kinda expensive. But all-in-all a great idea.<P>9) Defense skill cap made exactly same as warriors<P>Answer : This is a good idea, but look at this :<P>Skills :<P>i) Offense a-n-d weapons skill made identical to warriors for Rangers.<P>This is kinda unfair, they get Offense AND Weapon skills the same, so we Pallies/Shadow knights should get Defense AND Parry/Riposte/Dodge the same as warriors or am I wrong here ??<P>Pets :<P>Here are some minor upgrade ideas for the Shadow Knight pets :<P>Lvl 15 Pet : Please give this pet a self only Grim Aura, its not much but this 6 atk would let it hit a bit more often =)<P>Lvl 52 Pet : If you give the 15 pet Grim Aura, please also give the 52 pet a nice upgrade to Grim Aura, something like 20 or more ATK (Shroud of Hate ?)<P>Also the Shadow Knight Pets are just a copy of the Necromancer pets. Please,please ! make them a bit more unique, I got 2 ideas how to do that :<P>1st idea : Give the lvl 9,15,22,30 and 39 SK pets automatically a sword and a shield when summoned, and give the 49,52 and 58 SK pets two 1-handed-swords. That way they would look a bit more unique.<P>or the 2nd idea : Make the SK pets look like ghouls. I for myself like this idea more =)<P>Thanks for reading this, and please think about it.<P>PS: The planned upgrades are already good, but maybe... there can be some more things changed ? =)<P>Fally</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Oops I forgot something...<P>Harm Touch :<P>Yes the upgrades to Harm Touch went quite good, and many Shadow Knights are happy now, but I am still not. I dunno if this is possible for you guys and if you even like this idea, but here it comes :<P>Why don't ya just keep the old formula for Harm Touch : (10*level)+1 from level 1-40, (20*(level-40))+401 from levels 41-60. And make Harm Touch a *Life Tap* kind of spell. This would actually make it a real *Life savour* just like LoH. Just think a lvl 60 Shadow Knight would get 801 hit points and do 801 points of damage = 1602 points.<BR>LoH does kinda the same so why not ? And Unholy Aura could then be used as 1) an upgrade to HT or 2) even better make it another discipline, a totally different cool discipline, HT would be much less resisted then as Life Tap anyways (I would say). I have never seen a Life Tap from my necro get resisted, except when I tried to life tap from a MOB that was 8 levels or so higher than me =).<P>So thats it now =).<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Our spells are too resisted, too whimpy, and too slow.  They are too few battle mode spells.  Please see my analysis at this thread of how you can view spells in terms of damage per mana second:<P>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/054394.html<P>The biggest problems with the spells we have, and those even proposed, are their casting times.  As we get higher in level we acquire more mana efficient spells.  However, the casting times attached to these spells places many of them in the not memorized category.  Any shadowknigt with a weapon delay of 35 or less will not cast a spell with a casting time greater than 2.1 seconds as they miss the ability to try and land a melee blow for actual damage.  Almost all the spells starting at level 49 have casting times much higher than 2.1 seconds.  You will find that almost all shadowknights up to level 60 will have 7 of their 8 spell slots filled with spells that cast faster than 2.5 seconds, one of them still being disease cloud.  Why?  Because they are only for taunting.  A SK can potentially do more damage with the weapon at this level in the 2 minute battle than any of the spells offered.  I think it is pathetic that very few level 60 SK use any of the spells they earn from levels 50 on.<P>Next is the defense cap.  It is pitiful the first cap is achieved at level 39.  For 21 levels this cap makes tanking (with slight increases after level 50) increasingly hard.  It was at level 45 that I realized I was a paper knight.  I think it is a shame that plate wearing tanks like shadowknights have such pathetic AC.  The gear offered does not offer enough AC to make up the difference.  The SK spells as offered do not make up the difference.  This must be made corrected in the foundational calculations for AC.  I hear defense may be increased.  I hope that the increase is enough.  As it is now, the plate wearing shadowknight too often takes full double damage blows from the mobs due to low AC.  The tapping spells cannot suck fast enough or often enough, if they were intended to make up for this ability to get spanked so hard and so fast.<P>I also support a change form spell of some sort.  A zombie form could be cool.  It don't matter.  Maybe it adds attack and disease resist or something but lowers agility, etc.<P>GET RID OF BOON OF GAROU!  Characters who follow good gods or are agnostic should not be able to cast illusions that bestow lifetap!  When cast on a paladin, the paladin can lifetap better than an equal level shadowknight using vampiric embrace!  I don't care if they get the attack or dex bonuses but the lifetap has to go.  Doesn't fit concepts of character classes.<P>Spell lines need to be balanced with the vision the class receives.  If the SK is a defensive class as described by Abashi, then the SK should have a means to help carry a battle.  The SK currently gets a one hit wonder spell of shieldskin and a few very insignificant lifetaps.  I would rather not receive any shield type spells but instead receive some really significant lifetaps spell changes.  Just look how pathetic this is:<P><BR>Spell		Effect	SK gets at:	Necro gets at:<P>Lifetap		5hp	9		1<BR>Lifespike	11hp	15		4<BR>Lifedraw	45hp	30		12<BR>Siphon Life	75hp	51		20<BR>Spirit Tap	150hp	56		29<BR>Drain Spirit	226hp	60		39<P>Why are all the lifetaps piled on the end of the career?  The lifetaps offered don't even equal one half of one round of damage that is dished out but the mobs of given level.  Tapping in battle is seriously a joke.  In addition, the first defense cap is achieved at level 39.  No ability to make up for defense exists in an ability to effectively lifetap until you reach level 51 and then the heal is too low and the casting time is too slow to be an effective Battle mode spell.<P>I would like to suggest that following lifetap series:<P>Spell		Effect	SK gets at:	Necro gets at:<P>Lifetap		5hp	9		1<BR>Lifespike	11hp	15		4<BR>Lifedraw	45hp	30		12<BR>Siphon Life	75hp	39		20<BR>Vampiric Curse	189hp	49		29<BR>Bond of Death	720hp	55-60		49<P>I propose the lifetap DoT's vs the lifetaps as the casting times of the curent high level taps are prohibitive in battle.  By using DoT, the lifetap can be engaged in one combat round.  The lifetap DoT's are more in line with the ability to carry a fight, i.e. be defensive (I suggest that lifetaps are dual role, offense and defense).  Also the tuning of the Kunark and SoV mobs dictates that higher tapping abilities need to be found.  Nothing I propose relieves the need for shamana, druids, or clerics in a group at higher level.  It does however help the SK tank a little more if we can sustain one or two more hits.<P>Some may argue lifeleach at level 49 is good.  Yea, to finish a mob whose back is turned signaling end of battle.  Lifeleach is a 2 minute recycle time.  This automatically makes it a non battle mode spell.  Here is one spell where the casting time should be made instant.  Chain casting may occur but the mana costs are so high the SK will be limited by that factor alone.<P>BTW, why have a spell for level 49 that the NPC who gives it does not recognize you till level 50?<P>While many will say that is too powerful, remember, we are very limited by the mana we have available.  No shadowknight will be able to debuff, disease, vortex, and lifetap in each and every battle, especially if he hopes to play the tank role and help taunt!  There is simply not enough mana available to abuse the magic.  This also helps the SK who chose the thinking, higher INT races to benefit from one extra cast of something because the gave up such huge amounts of melee power by not chosing ogre or troll.<P>Next, where is the upgrade to siphon strength?  In the old game I assumed VI did not do it because they created the Dark Reaver to steal strength.  The problem is the weapon is sooooo useless since Kunark.  You will not see a Reaver wielded post level 45 and rarely after level 40. The heralded Reaver has a market value fast approaching 200 plat.  Add upgrades to the siphon stength series.  Tapping strength increases the seriously lacking attack skill we have from level 39 on.<P>Finally, how about a beguile undead spell?  In limited circumstances that SK could charm an undead for a short period of time.  I see this as a useful crowd control tool and its use is severly limited to undead.  After all, the high end game is all about crowd control.  I also think it is in line with the class to be able to coerce an undead to stand by the SK side.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Above level 50 a shadow knight has one main role, being a tank that does mostly melee damage. His spells are weak compared to casters and actually will lesson the damage output by halting melee. Sk's get interrupted alot too. <P>Verant claims that warriors will be the BEST at tanking and melee. IMHO this is unfair. Sk's share the same role as warriors(esp after lvl 50). Why can't sk's be better at some tank skills and worse at others than warriors? Warriors get spells that proc off weapons, so no halting of melee occurs. They get the best weapons and armor. Their armor has very good spell effects like invisibility and shrink. They pay less experience penalty than sk's. They get disciplines. <P>What do sk's get that make up for all of our deficiencies(compared to warriors)?<P>1) We get spells. The only spell that helps in groups is darkness and summon corpse. Darkness is rarely needed and is inferior to other classes snares. Summon corpse is expensive, is limited in the number of coffins you can carry. Why do paladins get a lvl 49 cleric resurrection spell that costs no plat(like a coffin)? Sk's get the summon corpse, a lvl 39 necro spell with severe limitations. The only other spell I use at lvl 55 are the minor ac and atk steals(shroud of pain, hate, str steal). These do NOT help use compete with warriors as tanks  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>2) Harm touch and feign death. Harm touch has been appropriately called harm tickle. It's too infrequent and too harmless against lvl 50+ mobs with over 15k hps. The uber mobs all resist it too. Feign death gets interrupted alot and the recast time has made it almost useless. I've died many times waiting to recast it. <P>My solution? <P>1) We need to be better then warriors at tanking in some ways and worse in others.Better at dodging, bashing, defensively: something. Warriors would be more balanced at tanking, but not better or equal in every aspect of tanking. Otherwise, sk's will simply be second class tanks. What's the point of being merely second rate at our primary role? Simply saying that we can "cast spells" is unfair. The spells have to be SIGNIFICANTLY useful to our primary purpose, tanking<P>2) We need some USEFUL defining(group friendly) abilities. Feign death and harm tickle just don't help. At lvl 50+ these are mere token abilities that don't improve us much at all. If diamondskin is going to be a spell, 12plat+ per cast will severely limit it's usefulness. Summon corpse is too expensive and cumbersome. Just ask a necro to summon you.  The paly's get the lvl 49 resurrection. It has no plat cost per use. <P>The improved skills could be a hugely upgraded harmtouch(recast every 15 mins), useful sommon corpse spell, useful(no plat cost) diamondskin spell. Something we(and only us) can do alot of that will add significantly to our usefulness to groups. <P>Otherwise, we could all be replaced by warriors to the benefit of the group.<P>choklo 55 sk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

What this would mean is fewer interupts of course, but more importantly and entirely the point would be Faster Casting times.<P>For instance, a SK trying to cast a 7 second dot is almost impossible when tanking or soloing. Not to mention how much melee time is lost. More than half the SKs I talk to do not use most of their higher level spells, like cascading darkness, simply because the casting times are just rediculous for spells that may be resisted or over written anyway.<P>If a Hybrid had the ability to hasten casting times at later levels, making their spells more useful (or just plain useful) and allowing them to get back to meleeing more quickly (or recast again in the event of a resist) it would even out the fact that their spells are 20 levels too weak and only marginally effective.<P>It would also mean that less tampering would be needed with a hybrids base skills and attributes (the very things pure classes hold against us) as these faster casting times would mean we would be more effective with our watered down spells.<P>This makes sense to me.<P>It makes sense that a Cleric, who has gained considerable knowledge in spells would eventually specialize in the healing circle.<P>It makes sense that a Necro would eventually specialize in one of their circles of study as well. <P>This makes both characters better, more efficient casters in the areas they most need.<P>It ALSO makes sense that a Hybrid would specialize their spells for one purpose and one purpose only. To cast faster. So they can get back in the fight and do their jobs as melee's.<P>I hear complaints constantly from Hybrids about their spells being obsolete far too often.<P>But when would the superior heal of a Paladin be more effective than the superior heal of a Cleric? (who has more mana and is specialized in that circle)<P>Answer; when the paladin can get it off faster. Because he has devoted his study to being able to cast lesser spells quickly, in order to get back to the melee. It still cost him more mana, took longer to learn, and insn't as good as CH. BUT, he has an advantage of speed with his lower spell and specialized channeling.<P>Right now Hybrids are Forced to make hard decisions; Do we cast dooming darkness, with a good chance of getting it off successfully in only two tries? Or do we waste alot of time trying to get cascading off and to stick, when it takes forever to cast?<P>So why not create a method that allows Hybrids at higher levels to shave off some of the casting time to their spells? Thus allowing those spells to be more useful and in the end, more balanced.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>all the things u are changing to sks dont help our 1 main problem at high levels. We are still going to be useless on multi group raids. We need 1 buff type spell that necros dont have that can add value to a group or a raid. We do less dmg to ubers than other tanks and our spells, which dont hit, will be overridden when 1 necro shows up for the hunt. I suggest a group vamiric embrace type spell(but stronger) which is VERY hard to resist. This way we add value to other tanks through the use of a procing lifetap. Dont give us stuff that doesnt adresss our problem of being useless at high lvls.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Okay, so Shadow Knights and Paladins are getting Defense raised to meet Warriors but every other defensive skill is being left the same. Meanwhile you're taking Rangers and boosting their Offense and ALL Weapon Skills to meet that of Warriors. Um...why? Now give a Ranger and a Warrior the same stats, same weapon, same skill at the same level and they will damage exactly the same. But take a Shadow Knight or a Paladin and a Warrior in the same armor, same ac gear, same stats at the same level the Warrior will still have better AC, better ability to avoid damage and better hitpoints. Sounds to me like raising our Defense only was more to throw us a bone than anything. If we're the defensive tanks we should have the same core defensive skills at the same skill cap as Warriors. If a Warrior and an SK at the same level, same skills, same stats etc are in the same armor (incarnadine for example) they should have the same exact AC. That's the flip-side of what rangers are getting isn't it? So how about making it happen?<P>Then I see that Absor is going to suggest that Paladins should automatically get crits against undead mobs. Correct me if I'm wrong but don't we as Shadow Knights also get undead nukes etc? Or is undead mastery/destruction now a Paladin thing? If they get that we deserve something similar. Maybe remove our undead nukes (nearly useless anyways) and give us some poison or disease dots in place of them then give us a crit system against live mobs, to counteract the Paladin undead thing. Since there are more live mobs put it at half effectiveness of Paladins if you wish. But, giving them a skill like that would kind of make them far more desirable than us in say Lower Guk, Plane of Hate, Plane of Fear etc etc etc. Just seems a tad bit wrong to me, but hey that's my opinion.<P>It's been suggested time and again but I'll reiterate. Put in a quest to change our epic from 2HS to 1HS with same stats and damage ratio. Perhaps make it 20/22 (Ebon Mace is 19/24) instead of 40/45. Then keep the same look but shrink it. That can't be hard to pull off. It should be rather simple actually. For example, put in a new mob in Kithicor during the day. Have that mob respond to a hail and mention Innoruuk's Curse and some lost scroll he'd seen on how to empower it to better suit the minions of hate. Then add 2 new NPCs into East Commonlands. They don't aggro anyone. One is a 63 Paladin, the other is a 63 Shadow Knight. They spawn at dawn and stand there. Hail the Shadow Knight and he asks for assistance in killing the paladin and vice versa. You help out and he gives you a scroll as a reward for your services. Take the scroll to the guy in Kithicor and turn it in. He reads off the scroll that he needs a Dragoon Dirk, a blue diamond and a brick of malitite ore along with Innoruuk's Curse in order to reshape the blade. Hand in the items and you get the 1HS version.<P>Add similar quests specific to each SK religion. Change the name of the 1HS for each religion as such: Cursed Blade of Hatred, Dark Blade of Terror, Horrid Blade of Plagues or something like that. Make the each version a tad different color, black for hate, blood red for fear, blackish green for plague etc etc. This would give us a very nice flair and a great motivation to obtain the epic. A 20/22 1HS blade with the same stats as Innoruuk's Curse and the new name would absolutely rock IMHO.<P>Vendric Ravenkrest<BR>49 Tier'Dal Knight of Hate<BR>Ancient Council - Saryrn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok pardon my french, but I am getting soo tired of the ignorant *****ing that goes on in these chatrooms.  SK's post 50 are nasty plain and simple.  I only see a need for a few changes.<BR>1) a mid 50 dot that is not firebased.  Blood Boil rocks, but if you fight against any mob with any fire resist an SK damage output is greatly reduced to not being able to solo that creature being left with Darkness and Heart Flutter.<BR>2) DON'T TOUCH the setup of the lifetap spells.  An efficient SK can make do with what he has.  I myself forgo the Leechcurse spell, not mana efficient and lived with the 51 drain until  I finally got to 56.  <BR>3) a slight raise in defense caps would be nice, but it is really not needed.  between 50+ lifetaps and group heals, a SK can really be an effective member of any group.<BR>4) SK's are the only hybrid that can effectively solo with the right set up.  Thank you for fear/dark!!!<BR>5) As far as weapons are concerned what more does one need??  MoSS, Noc Blade, Epic.....are some of the best EQ weapons available.  And there are ALOT of great 2hs out there if you want to go that route.  But any SK that forgos the 1h/sheild combo unless upgrading to the epic is just nuts.<BR>6) Any improvement comes with consequences.

</FONT><HR>Vagabond, I know Channeling does not speed up casting times. I was simply stateing that it could be made to do so for Hybrids.<P>Pure casters get specialization of one spell circle. This specialization allows them to cast faster for less mana, those spells within that specialized circle.<P>What I am saying is, create a channeling specialization for Hybrids that allows us to speed up casting of our waterd down spells.<P>As an example 2x the channelings decible point in haste percentage for casts... ie...<P>channeling 100 = 20% increase to casting speed.<BR>channeling 150 = 30% increase to casting speed.<BR>channeling 200 = 40% increase to casting speed.<P>Now obviously Im just picking numbers as a demonstration. Actual implimentation would have to be debated for end values.<P>Al this would do is allow Hybrids to put their watered down spells to better use, and allow us to be more effective in a group comprised of pure casters.

</FONT><HR>I'd even settle for a discipline that accelerates our casting time and renders us uninterruptable while we do so.<BR> <BR>/disc darkpower<BR> <BR>You are surrounded by a nimus of black energies.<BR> <BR>Something along those lines.<BR> <BR>At lower levels,SK's are in good shape. You want decent armor in black? Fine Plate,dyed. If they actually got tradeskills working,Imbued Field Plate. Wouldn't mind a helm that replaced our normal head with a skellie head graphic(of the right grim shade) though. Plus,we'd get that nice obscene cackle that way when we whacked things.<BR> <BR>The primary problem is at the highest levels,though. And it's more the uber-boosted monsters widening the gap between pure class and hybrid,and now melee vs. caster period thanks to Velious. Mobs are one-dimensional in their threat to parties at this level,and there are none that are "magic weak" as opposed to "magic invincible".<BR> <BR>If uber_mob_001 had a proc that summoned up some minions that were basically totally resistant to melee damage yet had low HP/MR I'd have a field day. Joe Warrior would be sitting there tanking the ubermob while I was nuking the "skeletal guardians" it called up,DOTing and what not to keep the thing from nuking the warrior instead. Don't put major loot on the summons,so that if we DOT em to death,they don't poof in a big battle.<BR> <BR>Make em casters. Lousy melee skills,just obscene protection from same. Said guardians would be necros,you could also easily add in elementals and other "summoned" critters as well that are throw other types of magic. In fact,add creatures like this throughout high-level zones.<BR> <BR>We now have a role twice as useful if not more so than before. We are taunters supreme that can keep these "meleeproofs" busy where monks,rogues and warriors can't-and have the HP/resists to take the return hits from spells and the like. Pure casters will be happy as well,as these will be creatures the MELEE types need protection from,that casters will "tank" for them whereas the melee types will tank the "magicproofed" ones.<BR> <BR>Not only that,since the "meleeproof" critters will have lower HP,we'll also be able to be effective lobbing even our undead DD's and lifetaps at em,and HT will have an appreciable effect since it's not a melee attack.<P>Does this change appeal to anyone else? Heck,I'd love to see critters like this even at lower levels.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First of all I want to sincerely thank Verant for giving us the latest upgrades, taking away our unjustified exp penalty and for the proposed changes on test server.  Thank you VERY much for listening to our cries of inequity we have suffered for the past 8 months.<P>I've read a lot of ridiculous requests for SKs such as giving us dual wield, parry, riposte, and dodge caps equal to warriors in addition to defense skill etc.  Guys we need to stop asking for the moon and think in terms of what is realistic.  I'm going to list a few things that I believe are realistic changes that we could use.<P>Defense raised to warriors is great, that would help out a lot and makes sense to me.  I always thought it was silly that Knights in armor whether they be Paladins or Shadow Knights had less AC then Rogues or Monks.  <P>Bash raised to a skill equal to a warriors would be great and does seem to fit with the class since some of us use shields a lot and the others are large race SKs with the innate slam ability.  The idea of giving us possible critical hits on bash would certainly not be overpowering and more of a flavor RP sense to our class.  Consider making critical bashes a stun vs lvl 55+ mobs.  That would give paladins and SKs something that no other class can do, stun a lvl 55+ mob.<P>Concerns that Shadow Knights have:<P>-Long casting time on spells is bad, we don't like it.  What we need is hybrid specific spells with shorter casting times that aren't as mana efficient as the necro equilvalent spells or have some other drawback.  Life Leech is a great example.  When we're the tank we find it nearly impossible to cast any spells with a cast time longer then 4 seconds.  Also when we're casting these 6+ second spells we're not swinging.  I would much rather have Life Leech II then Drain Soul.  I could only cast Drain Soul when I'm not tanking.  I would only cast Drain Soul when I'm hurt which usually means I'm tanking.<BR>-Shadow Knights suffer from Necroitis on raids.  We rely on our spells to make the difference to make up for our low damage output, yet uber mobs resist every necro spells and thus they resist ours.  When it comes to raids SKs are the absolute WORST tank to have.  We have the damage output of Paladins (GASP) but we don't have any group friendly spells like heal or LoH.  Our upgraded HT was a nice step that at least allows us to do SOMETHING provided the mob doesn't resist which to my experience has been over half.  <BR>-Shadow Knights NEED something that will set us apart from the other classes for raids.  Rangers have Predator, Call of Earth, and Strength of Nature; all very friendly raid spells.  Paladins will have stackable HP buffs wave of healing and their LoH is much more raid friendly then our HT which is resisted half the time with disci used.  BTW if we DON'T use our Unholy aura our HT is resisted 100% of the time vs uber mobs.  So it seems like Rangers have ATK buffs covered, Paladins have heals and hps covered what does that leave for SKs to contribute to a raid?  ALL of our decent spells are selfish and self only which makes sense for our class, however we still need something to add to the raid to make us WANTED.  I just hope someday to hear, "We need a few SKs for this raid."  All the pure melees have their place, Rangers have their place now, Paladins somewhat do, Shadow Knights still do not provide a function for the raid besides a weak tank.  Do NOT say that summon corpse is our function, thats only for emergencies when there are NO necros around which isn't often.  Summon corpse is AFTER the fact, AFTER we're all dead because we had 12 Shadow Knights on the raid instead of 12 Warriors.<BR>-Some kind of a damage mitigation would be nice.  If I had a discipline that worked half as well as a warriors discipline, lasted half as long, and had double the reuse rate I would use it.  <P>In conclusion SKs are now decent in groups.  We don't hinder them with our massive exp penalty anymore thank god.  We will tank decently enough with the defense skill boost and with our spells our damage output will be decent IF we have a bard or clarity.  Where we suffer is the raids.  Our mana does NO good BEFORE, DURING, and AFTER the big fight.  I call this Necroitis syndrome.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm kinda low level, so I won't presume to make any kind of judgement based on higher level spells or the like.<BR>If I may, however, like to ask a couple of things.<BR>#1 The Darkforge Armor is pretty tough... usually SK's either get itat much higher level than warriors get their Quest Armor, or have to get bigger players to "twink" them.<BR>#2 As much as I like the idea of having one good "sk-only" item in each weapon skill, as "Knights" shouldn't we be pretty much focused on 2H slashing and 1H slashing w/ a shield?<BR>#3 As unlikely as this is to be implemented, I think mounts should be available to any hybrid class (cept maybe Bard).  You know, a Nightmare or undead creature for SK's, a warhorse or warelephant for Paladins, and a light horse or a griffawn (or similar) for a Ranger.  Of course, this is might be unfeasible to implement.  Just an idea.<BR>#4 I think most players are either Trolls (large size and regen) or Dark Elves (higher int for mana).  I'm stubborn and play an Ogre SK, but I've noticed that I'm not very well liked in Neriak or Grobb based on starting faction, only Ogguk. (dubious in both)  Trolls not like Cazic-Thule, my diety?<BR>#5 SK's usually get only one serious gripe at lower levels that I've noticed... lack of quests.  I don't mean newbie quests, but rather those quests that you start low, and complete various parts as you get bigger, similar to paladins.<P>Anyways, those are my "gripes".  Honestly, I'd love SK's just the way the are.  Not overpowered, yet not underpowered.  Mixing a good dose of offensive and defensive without being too big in either.  Just tweak them a tad, more of their out of game play than their actual abilities.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>When I started playing EverQuest, I didn't have the mindset that many seem to have: that EQ is a video game with some added roleplaying aspects. I started with the belief that it was a roleplaying game with some added video aspects. I don't think Verant will ever be able to truly "balance" the classes while maintaining each classes originality and purpose. My ShadowKnight was my first character. Actually, the character started in D&D about 20 years ago, and a ShadowKnight was the closest class to him.<P>The only reason I'm saying all of this is that there is very little that I actually have to complain about regarding ShadowKnights, especially in lieu of all of the recent changes. I don't care about SK's being defensive or offensive (personally, I think SKs are a mix, although more offensive than not), or our spells, or our faction hits (ESPECIALLY our faction hits -- being so hated is part of our intrigue -- it may take him a little longer to gain the respect of Qeynos Guards, etc, but it's far from being an impossible battle). I remember this character being hated by most when I played him in D&D 20 years ago. I remember this character having a somewhat poor selection of abilities. I remember this character struggling (period). I came to EQ with absolutely no false hopes of having it easy, and no one who creates a SK character should.<P>However, all this said, I think the biggest waste of space in EQ are SK pets. I honestly cannot recall the last time I used my pet in battle... oh wait... I remember when... it was when I was power-leveling my brother's character (some 20 levels under me). Other than that, he's completely useless. He doesn't even function as a DOT. Either raise his stats, or reduce the MOBs' (and I mean all of them) stats -- you pick which is easier.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'd like to add my 2 cents<P>- In my record of testing with SK in my guild, Unholy Aura + HT results in resist against anything considered an ubermob.....  we dont have any 58-60 SK in our guild to test this part...<BR>on RARE occasion the HT will land... but generally only against those mobs it already landed against....  unholy Aura + HT is not helping our raid viability due to it not doing ANY damage...  is it possible to add the code for the following?<BR>when HT + Unholy aura is used against a mob in the 10-level lifetap limit, any SAVE is for half damage only...  thus a HT is GOING to do damage to a mob  750 damage/72 minutes from a level 60 Shadowknight is barely scratching an uber mob, but its a LOT better than seeing ZERO damage.<P>-Leechcurse does NOT help a SK in epic fights, they die before the drain takes more than 100hp...<P>REVERSE leechcurse, so that it leeches back the damage done by that mob to the SK.... When the SK is hit in melee, the HP go to a bank which will then be re-added to the SK in a fast DoT heal...  for every point healed in this way, the uber mob takes one point of damage from leechcurse.  The curse lasts only so long and once gone has a decent reuse time<P>This version of leechcurse cannot be abused by naked SK.... if you die, the curse is gone...<BR>If the mob focuses on you, you WILL last slightly longer, but you will still die...  it is similar, but inferior to the discipline defensive in that it reduces damage done to you, but not right away... you lose the HP and regen them back fast, but a concentrated effort on the mobs part will kill you faster than any warrior would die.<BR>This leechcurse is also similar to the Riposte discipline in that it reflects damage in a way...<BR>HOWEVER, note the warrior is basically invulnerable to melee damage during this time, the Shadow Knight is not... this means Venril Sathirs taps and proc effects still happen... it also means the SK is never invulnerable.... just hard to kill<BR>This discipline CAN be used to effectively do damage in an uber raid.... but you CANT be the uber mobs only target......<BR>You also cant be complete healed if you want to do damage!!!!  if the curse doesnt heal you, YOU DONT DO DAMAGE WITH IT!!!!!<BR>this discipline is in keeping with the SK mythos and truly fits the name leechcurse... it also is less powerful than TWO of the warriors disciplines, but has a flavor of its own.<P>-SK combat or damage spells over 4 seconds are useless 90% of the time.......  Any dot longer than 60 seconds is pointless for a hybrid on a non-uber mob, as they dont usually last that long in combat.. and when I do the math, said spell didnt even increase my damage output by so much as 5% overall to that mob because of the time i lost to cast it and the fact the mob died before the dot could have completed...<BR>I simply cannot rememebr the last time I saw a Boil blood come to an end before the creature died...<BR>such dots are also pointless on uber mobs as they are always resisted...<P>Adding such spells does NOT add to our grouping ability or uber mob viability.....<P>suggestion:<BR>- add a self-only buff that SK/PAL can use to increase their damage and to-hit potential....<BR>(holy sword? forboding aura *upgrade to grim aura)?<P>this is a way to help the damage potential of Pal/SK without raising caps.....  they must cast a self-only buff which takes mana and a buff slot which warriors dont have to.....  in this way, the spellcaster side can AID the warrior side and create a roleplaying way to allow the SK/Pal to do more melee damage without makeing it SKILL based...  perhaps the holy sword has limitations like casting time or duration, and perhaps the pally one does special damage vs undead, and perhaps the SK one just does more damage..  the extra damage would come from MELEE, and not procs or magic... but from making their sword more potent (focused holy or unholy energies)<BR>perhaps the holy/unholy sword only increases TO HIT and grants damage bonuses to one KIND of creature... pally and undead come to mind... perhaps the SK version causes wounds that do not heal or that reduce positive regen rates...<P>Advantages<BR>-it raises pally/sk damage (perhaps only against a certain type)<BR>-it raises to-hit (I hate those strings of misses)<BR>-it is ENTIRELY in character<BR>-D&D has such spells for their equiv classes now<P>Disadvantages<BR>-It takes a buff slot<BR>-It is a high level spell (53+)<BR>-You are going to have to refresh it (cast)<BR>-it costs mana<BR>-It may only affect one type of creature<BR>-Possible complaints from warriors who think that it will bring Pally/SK too close to warrior<P>Brik</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055531-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055531.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055531-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055531-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055531-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055531-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055531&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055531&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
