I will have little access to the Internet while I'm there, and I don't want to start a thread like this right before I leave. Also, for you Rogues reading, I'm moving you back to Tuesday next week, I won't be in the office on Monday.<BR>Monks are one of those interesting types of warrior that, as a class, we have tried to balance a rather large volume of damage dealing with a lesser type of armor. It's not an easy task to build a fighting class that is 'balanced' with a warrior but doesn't wear armor…<P>So tell me what you think needs to be changed about monks. Keep in mind that I am primarily looking for balance issues, but give me whatever you've got. I am also not looking for suggestions that would dramatically change the class, or that would require an army of people to get into the game. I'm mostly looking for tweaks that would help to balance the class.<P>Thanks.<P>Alan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

It looks like a tranquil staff.  That looks like a Imbued fighters staff.  That looks like a staff of battle.  And THAT looks like a wu's stick!<P>Come on, how about making an all black staff or other neat colors.  The velium brawl sticks are a nice change, keep it up!<P>2) More varied monk looks.  Robe or bare chest or leather.  Okay, we got our velious stuff, but how about changing the crescent and shiver looks?  We look like a newbie for 50 levels, I mean come on!<P>And maybe we could shorten the robes a bit?  In real life, wearing a robe would trip you up more than anything else, how about shortening them to about the length of a gi's top?<P>Oh yeah, and please drop the leather look on the crescent headband, I hate the Iksar skull look!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm all for Bodi's ideas.<BR>One other thing I think should be changed is the lvl 35 FD nerf. It's such a pain to pull now. I think it should be changed if a mob thinks your dead and goes away why would it come back?? Also when your pulling a caster mob and resist the spell why is it gonna keep attacking when the spell did nothing to you? I usually always have to resort to chain pulling now and just lay on my butt the whole fight when we are suppost to be the best DMG dishers. This is the biggest problem I have had.<P>44th Circle Iksar Monk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My measly 2 coppers on Disarm, specifically.  This of course applies to more classes than just monk, but I feel no real need to cross-post it.  If it is going to get noticed, it will get noticed.<P>I like disarm in theory.  I feel it fits in wonderfully with the concept of a monk (not to say it doesn't also fit in with others).  And in practice, I like having one more button to mash; combat can get boring when all you have is a kick.  The big problem with it is that it does nothing.<P>Earlier today I dinged 40.  Just spent the last 5 levels solo & grouped in crystal caverns.  Great place to work on disarm, all those pretty little orc miners running around with their non-magic picks.  Of course, when I actually do make that little worthless-as-loot baggie drop on the ground, it hasn't had any effect on the orc's combat effectiveness, but I feel like I've accomplished something.  Then I get a watchman with a velium weapon, and I am reminded that I accomplished nothing.  HE is the one I really WANT to disarm, but I can't.  Can't get rid of that annoying proc of his, because his weapon is magic.  And to get rid of that proc would actually have some effect too.<P>That contains all my thoughts, but in a jumbled order, so let me sift them out for you:<P>1.  Why does a mob with a weapon do the same damage as one without?  Doesn't that seem somewhat pointless?  Now I know that this suggestion would take a lot of developer time, but perhaps on those monsters that frequently or always have weapons (i.e. those orc miners), make them notably less effective without them -- or from a more quantitative perspective, lower the strength of weapon-capable monster types, and then turn around and give them a bonus for wielding a weapon.  End result is roughly the same monster, perhaps a little stronger, but when that disarm succeeds, a weaker monster -- you have accomplished something with disarm!  And since I can still go an entire fight at 40 without disarming those pesky green miners, this wouldn't cause disarm to be all THAT imbalancing.<P>2.  Someone posted the idea of allowing disarm to work against magic, but just drop the weapon into the mobs inventory.  I could see where there might be issues with this, since the NPC AI sems to automatically equip anything in inventory it can use, but if this is in anyway workable, I would love to see it.  Disarm would really have an effect here as well, since it would allow the meleeing hero in question to reduce the effectiveness of some mobs (via procs), again without causing sever imbalance.  Perhaps this could be instituted by creating a seperate set of inventory array positions that the AI never checks for equipment, and disarm moves the weapon to those slots.  (I can already see this one coming back to haunt me... Rastur would stop equipping the mino horn and every other pre-rastur monk in existence hunts me down and kills me for it).<P>3.  The last little tiny bit is the complete worthlessness of the miner picks.  Only sells for a gold and piddly change, no one in there right mind would ever equip it... probably has some quest like the orc pawn picks, but I have yet to find it.  I am not complaining about the item itself, I have no problem with it.  On the contrary, I would actually like to see lots more weapons whose sole existence is to be disarmed!  This would not really present any additional benefit unless combined with either of the above suggestions, but it would bring a little more reason to actually bother with disarm.<P>I don't want to see it go away and be replaced with something else I won't use, I want to use it.  I like the idea, but the execution could use some attention.<P>I know, I know, I'm long winded.  Always have been.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'd like to boil this all down as a sort of recap.  Monks are jealous primarily of warriors, because since Kunark's release, Warriors have had an increase in offensive capability that monks haven't gotten.  This infringes upon the monk being the master of melee.  Problem in a nutshell is that because of a monk's innate lower AC due to armor restrictions, lack of hitpoints due to class restriction, and similar damage output to warriors due to new low damage/delay weapons available to all classes and higher offense caps, monks have lost the clear edge they had in melee.  Quite frankly, post-50, Verant has given monks very little reason to keep playing monks instead of warriors.  Feign death and mend are good class-defining features, but so are hide-and-sneak and backstab of the rogue, and in a high-level group, backstab can help get the kill, and feign death will keep the monk alive.  As a group, I'd rather have the higher damage output of a good rogue over the warrior-like damage output of a good monk.<P>So what to do about it?  Monks would love to have any changes made to fall in line with their characters - more offensive output.  How does one balance monks offensively keep the game balanced as a whole?  It's hard.  But this is a mistake that Verant has fallen into themselves, and they need to make hard decisions.  Obviously skill caps cannot be raised, due to coding restrictions.  It would seem that this leaves two things left with which to increase damage output of monks:  reducing innate weapon delay even further and/or increasing damage bonuses of monks.  If Verant is worried about any across-the-board damage bonuses being imbalancing, perhaps damage bonuses against level 55+ mobs would be in order.  The main concern is the desirability of the post-50 monk in a group.  Perhaps a damage bonus in those critical situations would be in order.  Just a thought.  <P>But please don't ignore the imbalance of the monk as a pure melee class.  We implore you to balance us to bring us up to par with what was the original Vision of how a monk is supposed to be.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>This post is an arguement against what most monks have stated in previous posts. I am a lvl 53 monk on Quellious.<P>To say that we should be causing damage somewhere between a warrior and a rogue is a MAJOR SELLOUT, and is pathetic.<P>Most of us started this class knowing that we SHOULD BE the biggest damage dealers in the game. Through other classes getting "fixed" this status has become long gone. We are no longer the damage dealers in the game and a Rogue puts us to shame. <P>Now why am i stating these things;<BR>Firstly, our usefulness in groups and the general design of our class. Both the Rogues and Monks were always to be secondary TANKS to the Warriors. This was, by far the obvious thing to do. Hybrids can and also do tank very well (post fixes). To bring them up to a standard near to the warriors has been a good thing for the game. But to put the monk on the shelf and let others now outdamage them reduces the competancy of the class dramatically. Rogues and Monks should always be the damage dealers. To make it fair we should do atleast comparible damage. Both our classes have distint differences but also likeness. We deal damage. We suffer when we are beaten on due to lower HP, AC, defence abilities in general. We both have aviodance skills to remove aggro from us as we are not the ones that should be tanking, nor were we ever intended to be.<P>To ask for an increase in HP/AC/Defence abilities is to ask Verant to change the class from what it should be. Any addition would be welcomed however  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>What we really need is the ability to do a larger scope of damage with our flying kick. To leave the minimum as is would not be a major problem if with 170 STR i could deal damage for 400+ on occasions. This would see us once again fiting the role of damage dealer and our usefulness to any group. (Possibly as critical flying kicks but would prefer our FK to be much the same as a Rogues BSing weapon. The chance for a small amount of damage and also the chance for a large amount. Even saying that if we hit from the back our flying kick would do more damage would also be a nice fix.<P>If we were to get any other adjustment as previously posted by others such as; Taunt Ability, higher defensive skills, greater AC or HP, then we lose our identity and blend into a hybrid warrior. Also - None of the above would be a great addition to the class unless every one of those was implemented. Give us Taunt as is.. and we die. Give us the HP & AC without taunt.. why bother?<P>Next we need to look at the FD issue. Rogues have a way of escaping damage. And it is a far superior way than any other class has. Why was FD nerfed so badly? It was our way of says "Get off me and back onto that taunting warrior!". We need it fixed to how it was ASAP.<P>Unhooking the punch and kick skills is also an excellent idea and would make our attacks look more spiffy but also add more damage and variety to the game as it is.<P>We do need coloured type armour to be individual. (Possibly letting us Dye our armour?) Or change the look of more items in the game. Who wants to be a lvl 60 monk that looks like a newbie... blah!<P>AC on our class specific armour from the planes needs to be looked at seriously - OR - a reasonable explanation given as to why it will not be changed.<P>LASTLY;<P>If we are incurring an exp penalty for being a MONK and Rogues and Warriors are not... then why do we not stand out more superior as a class than those other 2? What is our penalty for? The ability to fall down on the ground and stand back up because the mob still hits us? NOT carry more than 14lbs? NOT to weild anything more than blunt weapons? NOT to taunt? Not to Evade? To have 1000HP less? Not to have any nice looking armour? Not be able to wear 90% of armour? <P>To say Monks are "Unbalanced" is an understatement. We need these things "fixed" or else post 50 we may as well retire. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

This would see us once again fiting the role of damage dealer and our usefulness to any group. "<P>Actually, this is not the only thing that needs to be done to balance monks.<P>The problem should not be viewed as "Monks do not do enough damage", although that is true; it should be viewed as "Warriors are doing too much damage."<P>If you view it this way, you see what the problem is -- with new equipment coming into the game with each new expansion, weaponry has to be upgraded over the old weapons in order to make the expansion attractive, etc.  The unfortunate effect of this for Monks, however, is that Warriors are now at the point where equipping a weapon causes them to do more damage than a monk (combined with nearly identical skill caps).<P>What I'm saying is that if more weapons and expansions are to be added, Verant has to keep an eye on the top tier Warrior (and hybrid/rogue weapons, too) to ensure that there are no weapons combos that will outdamage a Monk with certain equipment.  I prefer to use Celestial Fists as the measuring stick.  If weapons are to be introduced to the other melee classes, they need to be balanced against the Monk measuring stick (such as the CFs) to ensure that the performance does not exceed the damage output of the CFs from the *front* of the mob.  If these types of weapon upgrades are to be put in the game, CFs should be scaled accordingly.<P>I choose CFs for a few reasons:<P>a.  CFs should be the measuring stick rather than fists because it's unreasonable to hand every 60 monk the best weapons in the game (if fists were to be the balancing factor in other melee weapons).<P>b.  CFs are the 'defining' weapon for monks; some people say a CF/SoS combo or a Tranq Staff will outdamage it, but these weapons don't define the monk -- the CFs do.<P>The reason all of this needs to be done on a regular basis is simple;  All the melee classes are only as effective offensively as their weapons.  This worked out extremely well in the Old World, where the best non-planar weapon was an 8/24 slasher with a proc.  Monk fists at the time were 14/36 (14/30 after the "haste" ability given to fists), which was pretty darn uber.  Combine that with higher skill caps than Warriors, and monks were the damage dealers of the game (along with rogues, once they were fixed  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">).<P>  Then, with RoK, new weapons with incredible ratios or incredible speeds were introduced.  The low-delay, fast weapons became the weapons of choice due to the damage bonus.  Warrior skill caps were raised to be nearly identical to Monks, while Monk fist damage received no damage upgrade, only a small upgrade to delay (14/26).  Jade maces now outdo monk fist damage.  A Warrior dual wielding these maces comes very close to Monk damage output.  Rogues shoot into outer space with their damage output, especially once Ragebringer comes along.  <P>Enter Epic Quests.  A Warrior dual wielding his Epic blades will do more damage than a Monk wielding his Epic fists.  Not a lot more, but enough to cause the Monk to lose his role in EverQuest.<P>Enter SoV.  Amazing items like the Willsapper and exquisite velium stuff futher increase Warrior damage output over the Monk epic fists.  Monks have to find even stronger weapons just to keep pace.<P>I know people will say "Monks get weapons too", but that's part of the problem -- the Monk is supposed to be a hand-to-hand damage dealer.  I love the weapons that are in the game; they offer variety, increased damage at lower levels, they look good, and I'm glad they are in the game.  However, in the 'end-game' a Monks fists should be the best weapon they can use when combined with their epic weapon (which, incidentally, is a pair of gloves, not a weapon, though for technical reasons it acts like a weapon).  When a monk reaches his full potential he should be fighting without a weapon and being a primary damage dealer in the game, second only to the Rogue. <P>Anyway, that's my thoughts on it -- balancing Monks needs to be done each time a new weapon is added to the game or else Monks will continue to lose their role as new items enter the game.<P>Feel free to comment or flame  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>MONK VISION BY A MONK<P>Alan once posted in response to a request, or idea, posted by an EQ player, presumably a Monk player, that he “…would have to check to see what the Vision had in mind for monks”.  That statement shook the foundry of  the monk community.  It also raised the question as to what the “Vision” really is for the monk class.  As this talk concerns the balancing of this class, perhaps the best way to balance the Monk is the define exactly what the class is and what it does.<P>As stated above, the Monk is a melee hybrid that SHOULD fall evenly between the Warrior and the Rogue.<P>Damage Output:	Defense Abilities:	Armor Class/Hit Points:<P>Rogue				Warrior					Warrior<BR>Monk				Monk					Monk<BR>Warrior				Rogue					Rogue<P>The Monk class doesn’t have enough damage dealing potential as the Rogue but gains higher AC, Hit Points, Defensive Abilities, and Feign Death as means to temper this loss.  The Monk class also doesn’t have the AC, Hit Points, or Defensive Abilities of the pure Warrior but gains pure damage dealing potential, versatility, and Feign Death as a means to temper this loss.<P>Outside of pulling, Monks are damage dealers.  Many people consider us, and Rogues also, the melee wizards.  Though considering the Rogue’s pure abilities, perhaps we’re more of the melee magicians.  Monks use a combination of weapons and fists to quickly take small, but noticeable, pieces out of our enemies unlike warriors who slowly take large chunks out of their foes.  These small pieces are augmented by large damaging, potentially at least, special attacks.  During the course of a battle, the monk will easily surpass, or should at least, the warrior in the group.  And should he/she aggro the foe or come to a point where he/she cannot deal with an encounter solo, the use of Feign Death as a ruse is used to escape harm though this is a last ditch tactic that many just assume not have to use.<P>OFF HAND DAMAGE BONUS:  Hand To Hand vs. One Hand Blunt<P>This suggestion has been brought up before but I think it needs to be explained a bit further.  In an attempt to bring the damage dealing capabilities of a monk up to a more reasonable level, several monk players, myself included, have suggested adding an Off Hand Damage Bonus equal to what we have on our main hand now.  This suggestion would indeed increase our main ability as a class.  But the problem is that the primary goal behind this was to bring the Hand to Hand skill and damage on par with that of One Hand Blunt.<P>With the release of Kunark came a wide variety of weapons for Monks to choose from.  It was stated by Gordon Wrinn (spelling) that the purpose behind this was to 1) give the monk a choice between his/her 3 primary offensive choices and 2) to increase the overall damage of a monk when compared to warriors and rogues with the new Kunark weapons.  The problem that came of this was that monks no longer used Hand to Hand because their ability to deal damage with fists was not as adequate or sufficient as when a monk used weapons.<P>Example 1:<BR>Dual Fighting Batons (attainable at level 30)<BR>vs. Level 30 Fists<P>8/20 <BR>vs. 10/34 Human or 10/35 Iksar<P>Example 2:<BR>Dual Wu’s Trance Sticks (attainable at level 40)vs.  Level 40 Fists<BR>7/18<BR>vs. 12/32 human or 12/33 Iksar<P>As you can see, there is no possible way that a monk, Human or Iksar, using his/her fists can match the damage as the same monk with weapons.  On top of that, with the introduction of faster and more damaging Warrior and Rogue weapons has decreased the margin of the total amount of damage that a monk can dish out when compared to warriors and rogues.<P>A suggested way of increasing our total damage out put was to introduce an equal damage bonus to the off hand that already exists on the primary hand.  But there was a strong out cry from many in the Monk Community that by doing so, it still doesn’t address the problem for damage output for the players that use Hand to Hand only whether it be for role playing purposes or any other reason.  To solve this, I suggest the following solutions:<P>Solution 1)	Place an equal Damage Bonus on the off hand that already exists for the main hand for weapons.<P>Solution 2)	Increase the damage bonus on the primary hand for Hand to Hand ONLY.  Than, apply an equal damage bonus to the off hand that already exists on the primary hand.<P>By doing this you not only increase the overall damage that a monk can produce and thereby bring the monk closer to where the class should be, but you also increase FIST damage thus creating a balance between Weapons and Fists and making the use of the Hand to Hand skill versus One Hand Blunt skill just a choice and not one of necessity.<P>But, in doing these changes, it would of course call for changing several weapons readily available to the Monk class.  Some weapons would have to be changed to Primary Hand only.  These weapons include:<P>Wu’s Trance Stick<BR>Fighting Baton<BR>Jade Mace<P>Some other weapons would have to be deleted entirely from Monk useable.  These include:<P>Moss Covered Twig<BR>Efreeti Battle Standard<P>DISCIPLINES<P>With the release of “Ruins of Kunark” came a bonus for the pure melee classes once they passed level 50.  These bonuses came in the form of Disciplines which were meant to enhance the power of the pure melee classes in relation to the caster classes and their additional high level spells.  Unfortunately for the monk class, several of these Disciplines are unused because they fail to significantly alter our performances.<P>Level 52:  Thunder Kick<BR>Duration:  Instant	Recycle Time:  7 minutes<P>&gt;The next successful Flying Kick will do in increased amount of damage.&lt;<P>This discipline is not as effective in the eyes of the Monk Community as it could be.  Granted, with the possible implementation of a Minimum Damage on Flying Kick, the chance of “landing a Thunderous Kick for (6)” will be eliminated.  But even then, this is still not what it could be.  There are two possible solutions to improving this discipline.<P>Solution 1)	Delete the discipline altogether and add the Thunder Kick as an ability once the Monk achieves Level 51.  This would work much like a Warrior’s Critical Hit when using the Flying Kick special attack.  Of course the chance of landing a Thunderous Kick would have to be increased due to the long recycle time, but not increased to a point where it would become over powering.  If this is done, we suggest that you either move the level 51 discipline, Stone Stance, to level 52 OR just leave it as is and not fill the discipline for that level.<P>Solution 2)	Give the discipline a duration so as to allow the monk using this ability to land several kicks.  Of course if this is done, you would have to increase the recycle time to possibly 10 or 12 minutes in order to maintain balance.<P>Level 59:  Ashen Hand<BR>Duration:  Instant	Recycle Time:  90 minutes<P>&gt;The next successful Eagle Strike will do an increased amount of damage.  Also, the target can be killed outright under certain circumstances.&lt;<P>This discipline is one that is very rarely used by the Monk class.  The main reason is that it is nothing more than a novelty.  The Instant-Kill effect only works on MOBs level 32 or below and it rarely ever occurs.  Also, the amount of damage that can be attained through the use of Ashen Hand over a 90 minute time period is nothing compared to the amount of damage that can be attained via the use of Innerflame which lasts for 12 seconds and can be recycled and used three consecutive times during the down time of one use of Ashen Hand.  Another problem that exists with this discipline is it requires the retraining of a lesser special attack for use and many monks are unwilling to decrease the amount of damage they are already doing using Flying Kick just to increase their skill in Eagle Strike for use in this discipline.  The main reason that you included multiple special attacks is because each attack is superior to the last.  So, as one levels, he/she increases the damage dealt through use of more highly skilled and more technical maneuvers and no longer continues training in past techniques as they are no longer up to par.<P>Through the implementation of the monk epic quest reward, the Celestial Fists, Verant Interactive has successfully encouraged monks to go back to the use of the Hand to Hand skill.  They have further done so by increasing the skill cap to the same level as One Hand Blunt.  They can continue to do so by changing this discipline to meet the basic need and nature of the monk by making a revision in this discipline.<P>Level 59:  Ashen Hand (revised)<BR>Duration:  9 seconds	Recycle Time:  45 minutes<P>&gt;During the time of this discipline, all damage done through the use of the Hand to Hand skill, and this skill only, will be increased.  Also, there is a chance that the target can be killed out right under certain circumstances.&lt;<P>The chance that the target could be killed out right would be the same as the original discipline.  Though under this format, a killing blow would “proc” in the form of a 100% unblockable Eagle Strike.  The strike would still do an increased amount of damage as before should the user be unable to out right kill the target.  But in this revised form, the strike would do less damage than originally planned.  There have been reports of these strikes, while using the original attack, exceeding 400 points of damage.  I would suggest this be toned down slightly should this change take place.  This overall change would not only make this discipline more useful to the monk community but would also reinforce the desirability of the Hand to Hand skill AND would no longer require the training in any of the lesser special attacks.<P>The amount of damage increased for the Hand to Hand skill can be handled in two separate manners:<P>1) When using this discipline, the base damage code of the weapon being used (regular fists or Celestial Fists) would be increased by 6.  This would change the level 59 fists to 20/28, level 60 fists to 20/26, and the Celestial Fists to 15/16 thus making our hands, for the duration of this discipline, truly deadly and thus capable of instant-killing a target.<P>2) Multiply all damage dealt by 2 or 3.<P>It is also recommended that the level of creatures that can be Instant-Killed be raised to all MOBs level 49 and below.  This is recommended for the Rogue’s Assassinate and the Wizard’s Instant-Kill spell also.  The reasoning behind this is there are no MOBs of epic or raid potential at those levels.  Also, as a player progresses in level, the percent of MOBs he/she will encounter that are 49 and below slowly decreases.  And by the time a player obtains level 59, the off chance he/she will be facing such mobs if very small in my experience of play.<P>Level 60:  Silent Fist<BR>Duration:  Instant	Recycle Time:  7 minutes<P>&gt;The next successful Dragon Punch will do a considerable amount of damage.  It will also have a chance to stun the target.&lt;<P>As with Ashen Hand, this discipline requires the retraining of a lesser special attack in order to achieve the greatest amount of damage that can be obtained through the use of this ability.  Again, the main reason that you included multiple special attacks is because each attack is superior to the last.  So, as one levels, he/she increases the damage dealt through use of more highly skilled and more technical maneuvers and no longer continues training in past techniques as they are no longer up to par.<P>Also, the ability to stun an opponent isn’t really something a monk needs.  Large race Warriors, Shadow Knights, Shamans, and Rogues get the natural ability to Slam which stuns/interrupts.  All other Warrior races, Paladins, and Shadow Knights get the Shield Bash skill at a low level stuns/interrupts.  There are several caster classes which getting stun spells such as the Cleric, Wizard, Paladin, and Enchanter and the Magician “magic blades” line of spells interrupts as well.  All of these characters can stun and do so long before level 60.  Warriors get the Shield Bash skill at level 6 and the Stunning Kick at level 55 because that is part of being a warrior.  They are the “meat shields” and are designed to take the punishment that other classes cannot take.  That is why they get the high AC, Hit Points, and Defensive skills along with a naturally innate high magic resist so they can take the damage from casters as well as melee MOBs.  Their magic resist and ability to stun via shield bash/kick is their way of helping to protect the group they are in.  A monk does not need to be able to stun.<P>Another reason why the stun is not part of the monk line of thinking is because at level 60, the high encounter MOBs in which the monk will be facing cannot be “stunned” and would just resist that portion of the discipline.  Also, a monk has several weapons at his/her disposal which do stun/interrupt such as the Tranquil Staff.  Though these weapons are rare, so is the likelihood of a character reaching 60.<P>Finally, this discipline is not really desired by monks as we have the ability to do much more damage with a Flying Kick than we would do with Dragon Punch.  And as recycle time of the special plays no part in this, there is really no desire to use this discipline over Thunderous Kick as even the STUN will be of no help in the higher level encounters.<P>Below is a proposed revision for this discipline.  As a pure melee class and one which is capable of a great deal of damage, it seems reasonable to change this discipline to reflect this.  Therefore, I propose the following change:<P>Level 60:  Silent Fist (revised)<BR>Duration:  14 seconds	Recycle Time:  30 minutes<P>&gt;During the time this discipline is active, all successful Hand to Hand, Dual Wield, Double Attack, and Special Attack skill checks will land and land for 75% to 100% of the maximum amount of damage possible.  These attacks cannot be dodged, blocked, parried, or riposted.&lt;<P>It could be argued that part of the “…will land for 75% to 100% of the maximum amount of damage possible” portion of this discipline could be considered to be over powering.  But in defense of this, the monks main role is that of a damage dealer.  Keep in mind that this increase is for Hand to Hand and Special Attacks ONLY.  And with this discipline, one that is not unlike that of the Rogue’s Kinesthetics or the Warrior’s Charge disciplines.  The only difference is this Monk version is gained at a much later level.  And due to this, a small addition is made to substantiate the downfall of gaining this ability at so late in the game.<P>THE ABILITY TO INTERRUPT CASTERS<P>Many Monks have been calling for the ability to STUN.  This is due to the need for us to interrupt caster MOBs when there is no class present that can.  But the sheer imbalance that would be created through giving us STUN would be too much.  What Monks want, and need, is the ability to interrupt.  Though a monk IS NOT a warrior and cannot do what his heavier brethren can, we are called to fill the role of the tank many times when a Warrior is not available.  And as we do not have the hit points or the magic resistance that warriors have, we have a tendency to take A LOT of damage from caster MOBs.  Plus, we cannot prevent others in our groups from suffering from caster MOBs either.<P>A simple solution to this problem is to add the ability to “push back” the casting MOB with our special attacks.  It would be similar in nature to the “force modules” on the Sol A Clockwork Guards and the effect that is on the “Force Shock” spell.  This allows us to interrupt while not overpowering us with the ability to STUN.<P>PLAIN OF SKY REWARDS<P>Please look at changing the stats on these quest items.  When Everquest originally came out, these items were to be the pinnacle of gear that a player could obtain.  When “The Ruins of Kunark” was released, these items lost a bit of an edge due to the increased availability of almost equal gear.  Now, with the release of “The Scars of Vellious”, these items are all but useless when compared to gear already existing in game.  This is not only a request for the quest items available for monks, the Golden Sash of Tranquility excluded as it is a GREAT piece of gear, but for gear available for every class.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, I won't re-post what I have posted, but I do have a new idea - Why not give monks 'Specializations' like casters? Only in the case of monks, use two only - fist speed and fist damage - and have one cap low and one high like specializations. <P>ie. A monk could somehow choose speed as their specialization. An innate haste skill? One that starts from level 20, goes up 1 skill point per level and gives .5% haste to the fists per level. The idea is to give a monk an innate 20% haste by the time they are level 60. (Or maybe 25%, 30%, who knows). And the other is an innate damage increase, where starting at level 15, the monk's fist damage goes up by 0.5 dam every 5 levels (for a total of 10 extra damage points, for example). <P>Like specializations, the monk would practice one and get that specialization above X (after which that specialization continues on and the other specialization cannot go above). You can keep one capped extraordinarily low (say that the lower capped haste is only 5% or damage only 2 or 3).<P>It would certainly offset the weapons problem (as the haste and damage would apply only to fists, not to equipped weapons) as well as allow monks a serious opportunity to forego ever using weapons should they desire it, without compromising their usefullness to a group. Massage the idea as you see fit. I, for one, would love to be able to use my fists again.<P>Thanks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I basically want to see the monk's AC increased to as much as the Ranger's AC are because monk should be able to tank a bit. Not as much as the warrior nor the paladin and shadow knights. Right now they tank just as bad as rogues and cannot output as much dmg as the rogues.  <P>Second thing is the monk should not be a weapon user, but a fist user.  As many players have stated, a monk was suppose to be beating people up with nothing but their bare fist.  I think instead of increasing the dmg output of monks using weapons, you can replace them by putting stuff like Treant's Fist that goes on the primary and secondary hand slot that raises or increase your dmg/dly ratios and/or adds effect like Poison, Stun, Slow, DD, or any other Proc effect instead of putting it on 1HB 2HB weapons. (and add glowing effect or stuff to it..they look kewl)<P>This is not more on the balacing side, but more on the roleplaying side and how monks are suppose to be viewed in the sense of mmorpg players.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One of my main issues with monk is that we have a much to low damamge output compared to warriors post 50. The closer you get to 60 the more equal the two classes are in damage output. This is mainly because Monks loose the Skill advantage they had over warriors and rogues.<P>This is ofcoursea mistake and i see several solutions availeble<P>at lvl 51 monks should reseave the tripple attack skill. The skill should increase perhaps 10 per lvl post 50( the warriors get this skill although it stays at 1 as far as i know this should be a monk skill.<P>add the abillity to do double attack with special at 55 further more increase the damamge out put more of flying kick over lvls<P>Also like alot of other ppl said change thunderous kick it must be broken.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think monks should go one of two ways:<BR>1) Mystical warriors. A few spells or "mystical" skills. This route you don't need to increase anything on them, just give them something useful. Like a light heal or self shield, and gate (passing through shadows to go back home). Some sort of mesmorize, too. <BR>2) Killers. Through and through, masters of the art of war. Go this route, though, and you have to ask...Why the HELL are they the masters of fists? I think someone read their fantasy novels and got diligent, well trained monks confused with the barbaric warrior. Monks trained in the use of all light weight weapons. Shurikens, daggers, swords, bo. For the life of me, I can't think of why monks are these wired up quick jabbers. <P>Another little side note, Feign Death. Make it's chance of success reliant on available health. If you fall down and are bleeding to death, automatic success. If you are at full health, radiant and strong....and walk up, slap someone, then fake a heart attack, there should be a script for the NPC to laugh at you before he starts wailing on you for your stupidity. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>&lt;whine&gt;<P>I'd like to chime in a bit about the spawn time of Raster of Guk. I've been camping him for about a week now, probably 6 hours a night. So far, I've had zero luck. Tonight, a few guild friends of mine were there camping the ass/sup room and one of my ranger buds spotted Raster on Tracking. I was in Oasis getting supplies (food, water, bandages) when this happened. I downed a SoW potion and headed off as fast as I could. Figures that I leave the camp for 15 minutes...<P>About the time I hit upper guk, my bud informed me that he was dead, not showing up on tracking. I got back in there just in time to see a level 55 ranger running around having a blast killing everything in that part of guk. He had killed Raster and looted the item... it was totally wasted, didn't even go to a Monk.<P>Considering the amount of time I have to wait for Raster to pop, this came as a little disappointing. I camped out quickly before I did something to that ranger that we'd both regret. He'd regret it more, but I hate it when I get that mad... I'm always sorry later.<P>If you doubled his spawn time he would still be rare as hell... why not make him pop like Targin the Rock in Sol B? Targin pops between once a day and five times a day from what I've seen... of course the kpc is far more heavily camped than the elder room, at least on our server. It helps the pop time when your placeholder dies instantly upon respawn.<P>I'm in a large guild, but our highest members are only low 50s, most of the guild is mid 30s, so camping the quest giver for the Robe of the Lost Circle is out of the question, for me at least. Our guild wouldn't survive an encounter with a 61 Monk. Building up a guild is hard work.<P>So, I am stuck with investing another 30 or so hours next week camping Raster again. I'm doing this solo, btw. Nobody in my guild has the patience to sit through that camp... I can't say I blame them.<P>Funny considering I'll be turning in the robe for an upgrade and then losing it altogether after (if) I go for the epic someday. I do think that the fact that the epic ties into quests that start at level one with a sash/headband is very, very cool. The fact that it takes an average of 400 hours of camping just to get the items you need to begin the epic quest is a little extreme in my book. If you want 400 hours of camping then at least don't stack 25% of it on one single MoB... make us travel Norrath, go to 25 different zones... that's much more fun. I'd rather hunt down 50 common drops than 2 ultra-rare ones.<P>C'mon guys, do you seriously think that sitting for 30 hours in a room full of greens is fun? If I didn't have a vcr next to my PC I'd be clinically insane by now... well, maybe I am, but at least I'm still lucid  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">. I'd rather be out hunting in the Tower of Frozen Shadow... that's a cool zone.<P>Thanks<BR>Raviel Darkfyre<BR>Servant of the Tranquil<BR>(Working very hard to be an acolyte of the lost circle)<BR>45 Monk, Luclin<P>&lt;/whine&gt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I've screwed the RotLC quest all in total. Im going to plan a guild raid (hopefull) on Bro Qwinn. Also necros can root (level 39? i think). Dont make those fighting batons primary only. Monks aren't masters of just fists as someone pointed out. Why would you want someone to use their fist, its called a choice...One thing I do see is everyone goes for 1hb. The reason (dont have to be a rocket scientist to figure this out) is weight. Nearly all the decent (500pp+) monk 2hb weigh 10stones, is that a joke? When Fighting Batons are 2 weight each, all 2hbs are 10stones. I am at 11stones with my weapons and bags and misc crap, 9 w/out my 2 KDs. Why would i ever bother getting any 2hb. I would lose massive ac...<P>some examples:<P>Adamantite Bo Stick (good ratio for level 30 monk,bad proc, 6.5weight)<P>Baton of Faith (expensive! 6.8weight)<P>Bo Stick (40pp! on Ayonae Ro. 7.3weight)<P>Burnished Wooden Stave (crap, 11weight)<P>Greenwood Bo Stick (good. 5.6weight)<P>Imbued Fighters Staff (extremely expensive 4weight)<P>Peacebringer (very expensive, 10weight)<P>Rod of Battle (ok, 9.7weight)<P>Rod of Lamentation (8.5weight)<P>Sage's Battle Staff (7.5weight)<P>Staff of Battle (7.2weight)<P>Stormwood Battle Staff (10weight)<P>Tranquil Staff (10weight)<P>Those range from decent to drooling great. What do you notice? ALMOST EACH ONE IS ABOVE 5 WEIGHT!!! I consider these tradable and semi obtainable (that is why no brawl sticks are included here, or no drop I think). Why would any monk go for these? Dmg is the only reason. Lose ac (either gear or over weight) to do some dmg. How about thinking about the "vision" and including low weight 2hbs. (i know i missed some weapons, you probably should also realize they are heavy as well). Please add some 2-4weight 2hbs or change the weight on those. Ive always wanted to train in 2hb but why lose AC for it? <P>Adamantite Bo Stick</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Our damage dealing ability needs to be fixed, and that topic is well addressed by others. I support Bodi's post. <P>Absor, I want to help provide an understanding of what we monks go through in growing up to the higher levels. <P>No other class endures the camps we are faced with. In order to be in a position to START our epic quest, we spend hundreds, yes hundreds of hours camping rare spawns, usually without the benefit of experience or loot. Raster is sadistic. I spent about 60 hours camping, and was LUCKY to get him after that.. My guild brother spent over two hundred hours with no luck, including gpoing round the clock more than once. I have spent another 80 hours there on HIS behalf with no luck. That is a total of almost 300 hours spent on his Raster camp.<P>I have not seen him online for almost two weeks now. I believe he has stopped playing the game out of frustration. Is that what is intended by the design of this camp? It is the result you are getting.<P>When you look at our quests, and the rarity of our good drops, it is clear that our "return on effort expended" is out of whack when compared to other classes. You have forced us to need equipment, yet made it almost impossible to obtain. In all my time playing, I have seen only TWO jade maces being wielded by Monks. One was on a level 15 twink!<P>We Monks pay our dues in many ways. We are almost always highly skilled and knowledgable. If you want to know a zone, learn it from a monk. If you want to know how to pull..  ask a monk. All that is good and part of our vision and mystique. We are willing to pay our dues..  we truly are. But once we have achieved what most players in other classes would never attempt, the results should reflect that. We should be dishing out damage in excess of what they can! We should be the "masters of melee" that we signed up to be.<P>Link reward (damage ability) to effort expended. Link reward (damage ability) to risk taken. Do that and we monks will be in good shape!<P>Torami Truefist (until you forced me to use weapons)<BR>Lost Circle Monk<BR>Torvonnilous</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There are a ton of great ideas, some can be implemented easily some not. I have posted before that haveing a damage reduction ability offered as a Skill (Iron shirt training, this is historically accurate as well) Lvl 20 skill. this would address the tank problem without haveing to give massive hp (a 250 hp inrease would be nice) or giving us massive AC changes.<P>This skill would also add to the uniqueness of the class and reflect class description. With this ability we could hang in fights longer.<P>Stuns, Instead of doing massive damage equal to every other warrior class, it might be worth testing the approach of variable stuns to a monks attacks. This would take the edge off the number crunchers and add a new dimension or calculation of effectivness in a crew. this something that should be persued.<P>Weight, Monks take it in the rear with the weight penality. Some folks have posted monk only weight reduction items as side quests. This would be of great benifit to the mid level monk community. Many monks are stuck doing logistical work that would amaze any high level manager in a fourtune 500 company. Its funny how 10 plat can cost you 14 ac.<P>All this and we get an xp penality?<P>Anyway  my two coppers worth.<P>P.s.

</FONT><HR>More than anything else, make my fists a viable weapon again.  Yes I think a small modification should be made to the epic fists, so that the CF do more damage than warriors.  But, overall, make my fists a viable weapon at all levels, even without CF.  Or atleast do something that makes our fighting style more unique.  Punching something is the same as slashing something.  Give us more options.  Warriors can bash, kick stun etc.  We have flying kick (which I hit for 3 dmg more than anything else), but looking for something that can help our groups.  Not sure if it could be slowing to a small degree on top of shaman spells, crippling the mobs ability to duel wield, or run away.  But, something that makes us more effective.<BR>I do not like the FD nerf.  I recently inadvertantly aggroed a Kelethin guard at level 35.  FDed, hit FD about 15 tims eventually, waiting 10 minutes as the Guard went home and continued patrolling.  Eventually I had to stand and run to CB zone cause it never mem wiped him.  Same thing happened in Kedge last night with a mob only 4 levels above me.  Had to zone again.  <BR>I am not saying add all these things together, that would perhaps give too much of an edge.  But, work on some of it.  There does need to be a change.  I have a 57 warrior, and when my monk gets that high I am sure he will not be as effective.  It is true that warriors are overly powerful, but that is your fault.  You have recently made changes for RAngers, Paladins, and Shadow Knights.  Monks are still left alone in the dark.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One quick comment on the Celestial Fist stacking issue:<P>Ragebringer (Rogue) and one of the Ranger blades (can't recall the name) have the exact same statistics that the Celestial Fists do (with the exception being that our fists are SPELL-haste, and theirs are ITEM-haste).<P>No matter what items or buffs a ranger or rogue is carrying, they get the bonuses to ATK and AC that their epic weaponry provides.  If a monk has ANY ONE of a long list of buffs on them (see Bodi's post for details) they LOSE their ATK and AC bonuses.  Please correct this BUG on our epic weapon to bring it inline with the other epic weapons.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First off this is my first post so be gentle.<P>Basically from everything I have read / heard from people in the game a monk using only fists simply isn't a viable option for most of the levels.  This upsets me because I started playing a monk for the sole reason that I wanted to use my fists exclusively.  Obviously Verant cannot make fists the best weapon in the game for the entirety of the game or everyone would simply play a monk because you would get the best weapons for free.  My solution to this (NOTE: I don't have any idea whether this is even possible or not) is to make a series of quests for a monk the reward for each would be to lower delay of fists or raise damage of fists or both.  As to how this would be implemented if possible I would suggest making it an item that you use one time and it permanently raises your attack or damage.  If this is not possible then I would suggest making another series of quests like headband/sashes quests that would allow you to turn in your previous gloves item for a new more powerful version.  Obviously make the entire item set noloot/lore so that the monk cannot be twinked out using this.  Also the damage would of course only change H2H values.  I also agree with the idea of unlinking our special attacks.<P>Alcair<BR>15th Monk of Xev</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057050-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057050-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057050-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057050-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057050&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057050&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
