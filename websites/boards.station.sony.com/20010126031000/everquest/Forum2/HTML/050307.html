And that's just Antonica!<P>There's two or three others that don't exist on Odus, and another two or three on Faydwerr.<P>This is something that could be made into, say, another add-on, or just added in over time.<P>I allways wanted to see these zones, but the only ones that have been added since release are Paineel and the Hole.<P>Anyway, just a thought.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>At first glance, yes, you could be right, these could be allready integrated into the current zones, but In looking further at the map, there are landmarks that are missing.

</FONT><HR>Once upon a time (early 1996, to be more precise), Steve Clover and I drew the world of Norrath on a white board in the old Sony Interactive Studios building.  We added rough names, including most of the starting cities I think (Steve is really good with fantasy names, and he also came up with the name 'EverQuest', btw).<P>Then, a few months later, Bill Trost came along, and he and Kevin Burns began to fill in a lot more detail... mountain ranges, lakes, oceans, and other regions, as well as dungeons and such.  <P>They did this for all five continents, and after working on the map for a while, they started to flesh out the points of interest, writing up documents describing them.<P>Some areas we meant to include in the game, and some areas were meant as context and background, similar to maps included in many fantasy novels, depicting areas the protagonist may or may not one day travel to, but implying a vast world and a deep history.<P>And, as actual development of the game progressed and we learned what could and could not be done, and how long it took to make a zone and all of the content associated with a zone, we narrowed things down a bit and came up with a list of primary areas of Norrath we wanted to cover. <P>And then, a little later, we decided, after experimenting with zone density, that it would probably be better to include less continents with more zones, as opposed to more continents with less zones.  So we axed Kunark and Velious, hoping one day we'd get to do those too, but realizing it would have to be after launch.<P>The good news, of course, is that slowly but surely, due to the continued success of the game, we've been able to fill in other Norrathean points of interest; for example, the Hole, Paineel, and the Temple of Solusek Ro, and over the next year, the Warrens and Stonebrunt Mountains.<P>-Brad<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You know, with everybody complaining about Verant releasing an expansion designed exclusively for the high-level characters (Velious), it seems like maybe now it would be a good idea for them to concentrate on mid to low levels.  The congestion in zones like Oasis and GFay is a well-known "problem," and adding in zones like Lake Neriuss, Broken Skull Rock and the Unkept Woods would be a good move on their part, if they designed them with the 10-30 crowd in mind (instead of 30+).<P>It would be nice if Odus weren't such a joke of a continent too.  Right now it's just a glorified island  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Zones like the Grand Plateau and the Barren Coast sound pretty interesting...  Well, at least Brad mentioned adding the Stonebrunt Mountains in.  That brings the zone count for Odus up to a grand total of 6!  (Okay, 10 if you want to count Erudin and Paineel's component zones, and Erud's Crossing as part of Odus).<P>Just out of curiosity, has there been any talk of another expansion?  From the sounds of it, the five continents that they planned on having originally have all been introduced now...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think another expansion would be fine from a business point of view (it would sell) but really how far can you stretch it??<P>Another expansion IMO would require another lift on level cap to keep the 60s happy which in turn would require a complete new batch of spells for all the casters. Probably new disciplines and skils for all melees and undoubtedly another vast ammount of new content for the ubers to play with. On top of this, lower levels will expect their share of content which all in all adds up to a LOT of work.<P>I'd love to see it, but I actually doubt it will happen. Maybe as Aradune says, zones will be added here and there but I doubt they'd like to get to a point where a single group of level 70s strolls into Veeshans Peak for a farming session.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think VI made a statement a while back that no zones are newbie zones (with the rude individual incident) and that they were happy with the number of low level zones.<P>My own feelings about oasis are that there are plenty of places newbies can go for exp but for some reason they hang around oasis.  This makes it hard for higher levels to keep them safe from Speccys because you cant swing a cat without hitting a newbie.<P>As for SoV, I find its a great place 30- 50 ish but from 50+ its more of a raid place.

</FONT><HR>IMHO the way zones are implemented make it so that the guild with the largest numbers will get to explore it first.  Case in point...The Hole came out and the 2 largest guilds on my server were there...over 80 people in the zone when it was first implemented.  <P>When it comes to expansions, I have a question.  Before I ask my question I am going to cut and paste the response from Brad...<P>Part of Brad's Response:  And then, a little later, we decided, after experimenting with zone density, that it would probably be better to include less continents with more zones, as opposed to more continents with less zones. So we axed Kunark and Velious, hoping one day we'd get to do those too, but realizing it would have to be after launch<P>So my question is this.  You already knew about Kunark and Velious, however, neglected to take the time and implement before launching.  As a result we had to pay additional for these zones.  We had to pay additional for the ability to level to 60...the ability to cast certain spells and use certain disciplines.  <P>As it is we pay at least 10 dollars a month.  With over 200,000 K players it doesn't take a Harvard Graduate to tell what kind of money you are making.  <P>When are we going to see zones/abilities/spells that we don't have to pay for?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Regarding crowded zones of our youth:<P>Oasis, High Keep, Lake of Ill Omen, South Karana.  They're similar in that they're always packed.  <P>Why?  It's pretty safe.  Outdoor zones are generally good hunting (HK has guards instead).<P>But take a look again at that last producer's letter.  Read the part about finding good, well-trained dungeon hunters at level 50.  Now ask yourself how much training you get going to these crowded outdoor zones?<P>Get a group together, and head into one of the dungeons that just go an XP bonus.  In the lower levels you can head to Kerra Ridge (save Odus!) or Runnyeye Citadel.  Higher up, go to Permafrost or Solosek's Eye (Sol A.).<P>Find people you trust.  Learn to hunt in deep, dark, dangerous dungeons, without sow!  Hone your dungeon skills now, while it's still relatively easy.<P>Remember - EQ gets harder as you gain levels, not easier!<P>-Azlina Crafte &lt;Ebony Order&gt;<BR>Enchantress<BR>The Nameless <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Brad,<BR>What about Veksar?  I know it isn't part of the general game proper, but it is part of Kunark.  While Kunark is an expansion continent, you can no longer get the normal game without it.  Most people now that play the game have Kunark.<P>Right now Kedge Keep is the only water only dungeon in the game.  I think Veksar would compliment the game as another all water dungeon.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>They have added "free content".<BR> <BR>Upgradded:<BR>paw<BR>kerra ridge<BR>najena?<P>New:<BR>Temple of Solsek Ro<BR>Paineel<BR>The Hole<BR>Hate<BR>Fear<BR>Air<P>Comming soon:<BR>Warrens<BR>Stoneburnt mountains<BR>**Can we get an idea of what to expect of these zones?**<P>New spells/abilities/equipment:<BR>Velious and Kunark BOTH had some sub-50 spells that you could have imported and scribe. You can also have them cast on you. Equipment from these zones seems to flow to non-enabled people as well. Skills like rogues evade, necros screaming terror....SK's got summon corpse, pally got resist disease which aren't new..but new to them. And I think you can use the resist discipline as like a level 34 warrior or so.<P>Personal thoughts of expansions:<P>If they add more spells it will be more for flavor and less about power. I'd suggest whole new spell lines that are epic in nature (series of small quests) that you build on as you level. IE you must have the 34 mist elemental spell before you can quest for the 39. And maybe make multiple similar lines with a twist (mist, steam, & metal pets) but you can only do one of the quests because your faction goes down with the other quest giver. Kind of like specialization.<P>Less raids, more group level stuff.<P>But honestly I think levels will be hard to give out. For example most melee are at 250 skill now. Thier database handles numbers up to 252. Mobs were tuned for level 60 max...etc..I think we will see more content. More flavor spells. More equipment. But levels...while I'd love to gain levels again (57enc 52 clr will max both probably) I think they are a bit cautious there. Levels wil be small in number if available and VERY hard to obtain. They might need to offer levels later to sell expansions though. Velious sold well...but because noone was level 60 yet really..when they approach 60 they will look for more advancement.<P>I'd love to see a new race like the iksars with kunark. <P>Of course EQ2 is in the works somewhere with a new higher standard of hardware etc....as is some starwars thing. I'm not much of a starwars fan.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I just find it funny that the Warrens was proposed to be released prior to the info on Kunark and the most recent expansion Velious came out.<P>All 3 Paineel, Hole, and Warrens were something Verant addressed up front when the game first started and said they were on their way.<P>Both Paineel AND Hole were delayed in implementation.  Warrens originally slated to go in a few months after Hole.  It's now been a year and 2 expansions have been released and Warrens is still NOT up.  It's not so much that people think that they are entitled to more content in original EQ.  It is the fact that you have stated, and given rough estimates on when these would go in.<P>If you call releasing 2 expansions in that time of 'fleshing out' original EQ NOT ONE new zone was opened that wasn't part of the expansions.<P>Either do it or don't I really don't care.  I like the game, but I hate the spin doctoring and broken promises.  Yea yea I'm sure it will be up and running soon but you guys did say it was in the works and comin out soon.........................<P>Still no Warrens.<P>BTW Nice job on Kunark.  Even Better job on Velious.  G'Luck on balancin all the classes heh. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I recall reading a post about thoughts on the next expansion from someone from Verant. They said the next one will be more along the lines of Kunark and not Velious.<P>After reading that, I saw that poll on EQ.com about which race would we want to play most. Pixie won.<P>I'm thinking that the next expansion will add a new race (hopefully more) and a new area to explore. Weither or not that new area will be a continent is unknown.<P>Personally I'd love to see three races added. Pixies/Faeries and a Neutral/Evil waterbased race. The entire new area could be a huge chain of islands (similar to the icy fingers) but each island would have it's own zone, perhaps many islands per zone. The Pixies/Faeries could have a small empire on the chain of islands (Since they're small the islands would seem like continents to them, right?), and the Water-based race could live in the seas that the islands are on.<P>This new area could be placed WEST of Odus, in "The Abysmal Sea". The boat could take off from the river in Toxx forest and travel west from there. This would promote alot of traffic to hit the "new free zones" when placed in Odus =)<P>As for the water-race, I'd guess it wouldn't be the Kedge. Phinigel is the last of them, he killed the rest. It would have to be a new waterbased critter. Perhaps some sort of crustacean, that would be able to go out of water and be ok. They should worship Prexus, and be on neutral terms with Erudites, but be at war with the Faeries.<BR>Imagine taking the Scorpians claws, mount those on a darkelf. Then instead of having two legs, add the scorpians legs and a lobster tail. They should be a medium race, and include classes like Rogue, Cleric, Warrior, Wizard, Enchanter, Monk. Being a lobster like critter, they should have high swimming and good starting AC. <P>The water areas could have all kinds of new water based MoBs and old too. <P>The Faeries and Pixies could be really neat to play, but hey shouldn't have the ability to fly right away. Maybe after level 20.<P>There could be an island with Cyclopes, remains of the last intelligent Clops, at war with the Faeries, and not so friendly with the Lobster-Dudes.<P>I dunno, I'm bored. Anybody think this would be a neat expansion? </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hmmm, good point about the game engine. It's kinda weak, hehe. Maybe a Siren (like kedge sirens) that grow legs when they went on land. that way it looks like a green wood elf.<P>OR, they could do a deep sea version of the deepwater goblin/bloodgill goblins. Ones that aren't stupid. They were so deep that the Rathes Curse didn't effect them, so they rule the ruins of the old Kedge city now. They could probably get by using the current goblin model.<P>OR, They could make the model for the lobsterman/lobsterwoman work. Like a Dracnid, but with a lobster tail and Skorpikis claws.<P>I dunno, I like lobsters. They taste good with melted butter, and I think I'd like to play one =) </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=050307&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=050307&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
