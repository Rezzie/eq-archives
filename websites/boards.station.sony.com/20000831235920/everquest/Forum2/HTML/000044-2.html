</FONT><HR>Rahan, <BR>You can state what you like about whether you think I know anything at all.  This is an open discussion.  Simply because you do not like hearing someone who does not agree with you does not give you the right to infer lack of knowledge.<P>But you cannot dismiss the point.<P>As you say, to keep it short:<P>There are excellent weapons, with good stats.  And these weapons are good for paladins.  That they are marked paladin only or not marked paladin only has absolutely nothing to do with the efficiency of the weapon.  Period.  get over it and go get a nice weapon and bash some stuff.<P>I know yall feel slighted by not geting more class specific stuff.  You have made that obvious.  This started as a simple comment that paladins do indeed have access to some impressive weapons.  That they are not paladin only does not preclude you from using them.<P>If your thought is that the existing weapons that you share with other classes are inferior due to the weapons not having more impressive stats, then your post should have read:  "give paladins more weapons with ratios better than rangers and warriors, etc" not be a complain about the sheer quantity of paladin specific items.  Because that is a wholly diffrent topic.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well I totally disagree that there are MANY paladin weapons.  There are maybe 7 that paladins can use that are not meant to be duel wielded and still drop.<P>Compare that to the 10 class specific weapons rangers can use and at least another 10 multiclass weapons they can use, the number of paladin usable weapons gor 50 + is severely lacking.<P>if paladins only had one weapon in the game would you say hey you have one weapon and its good so use it?<P>No becuase that weapon would be so expensive and so rare that very few paladins could get it.<P>The same is true to lesser extent in the current situation<P>Your argument makes zero sense.  You are basically saying too bad.<P>Say for example every melee class had 10 types of class armorc armor except rangers who had one set but it was shared by 4 other classes. Would you say tough rangers theres one possible armor out there for you. Who cares if other classes get their armor more easily. Who cares if the abundance of amror for trade for other classes means its easiliy obrainable. Who cares if prices are alot lower on armor for other classes.  Who cares that you have to comepete with 4 other classes for armor while other classes have 10 types that they alone can use.<P>No you wouldnt say that at all, becuase it doesnt make any sense just as your argument makes no sense.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>As a 49th level paladin who's just getting going in Kunark, I have to wonder why bother when I have hardly any item to look forward too.  The deepwater armor is underpowered compared to warriors and there's no weapons.  Oh well, as a hybrid, I can't get into hardly any Kunark groups anyway, so maybe its time to shelve my pally.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>&gt;Warriors have the most class-specific? why? <P>I suspect it is because they are the wariors.  It is self defining in a way.  They are the armed combat "kings" are they not?<P>Regarding comments that the weapons being paladin only and thus being the only weapons balanced for one handed use is kinda scary.  So you won't use a better weapon just because it is not paladin only?<P>This is my final post on this topic, frankly I'm suprised.  The fixation over having weapons marked paladin only is beneath you, and I'm sad that you are fixated on it.<P>Has it occured to anyone that with the improved ratios of kunark weapons (compared to the original lands) that concern over one handed balancing is different than it used to be?    Many weapons exist in kunark that a paladin can use and that that are superior to weapons pre-kunak.  Get one and have fun. Forget what other classes could use it and just get one that is nice and bash stuff.<P>Oddly enough, the paladins that I know are doing quit well with their weapons including the plain old mithril 2 hander and are having a grand time and deal out impressive damage.  Never hear a one of them saying "we need more paladin weapons in kunark, rangers got more".  <P>Have fun yall.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>To all those who are posting in here saying "too bad" Go mind your own damned business.  Nothing sets me off more then hearing someone who knows nothing of the subject refuting a claim of those who do know.  <P>The facts still remain the same<P>1.)  Paladins cannot duel wield, therefore weapons that other classes can duel wield with DO NOT CUT IT FOR US.  We need weapons that have slightly higher dmg to offset that problem.<P>2.)  There are only 2 class specific weapons in kunark that are post 50th level, while the other classes have upwards of 10.<P>3.) The firey avenger does not count for a weapon post kunark because 99.99% of all the paladins WILL NEVER GET ONE!  We need a weapon better then ghoulbane which is actually obtainable.<P>Please tell me how you can refute our claim on this?  I dont understand how other people can argue that this is fair?  Its simple math to figure out that we have been shafted on our weapons.<P>So please, im going to say again.  If you dont support this thread, or have an intelegent argument, please dont post in it.  We dont need to spend our time arguing with people who dont know anything about the subject.<P>Sir Derek Drygon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Gaelron:<P>The "interesting proc" is something I've been attempting to champion for a while, and it has improved... but not by much. I would love to see some weapons appropriate for a paladin with mediocre damage output. Thins like Heals (even a very low level heal), group heals, GRM, breeze, other group buffs would be super.<P>sodor:<BR>"You have 4 weapons that drop in Hate."<P>No, we don't. There are 2. Both are very slightly better than soulfire. The sprinkler is a decent weapon, which I used for many levels. But it's not kunark, and wasn't designed for 50+ characters.<P>Ofbac:<BR>"What items are class specific is totally and utterly irrelevent. It's about what you can use."<P>Only if those weapons WOULD be used. No shared 1H weapon (with any dual weilding class) would ever be ever be used by a paladin. Although by your posts you seem to not understand the DW issue at all so I'll not exasperate myself trying to explain.<P>PaganQWA:<BR>"I'm not even going to read this envy post..." You obviously already did. If you would like to contribute some data or perhaps an argument to this discussion, then please do so. Otherwise, kindly piss off.<P>Sirrach:<BR>"I'd also love to have an amazing weapon like the FA. Where's my godly weapon?"<P>So would I. But sadly because I am 53 I cannot have a FA. Warriors have a lot of 2H weapons with greater ratios than the FA - and all of which are easier to obtain. So you're saying you want all those items to be reduced in power, and placed in a broken incredibly difficult quest? </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>&lt;&lt;Are you upset because you do not have more? (you can only use one at a time)&gt;&gt;<P>I am upset because I don't have a holy axe.  Why?  Because I find it odd that the second Oldest God to Norrath has not had any time to create one, especially when his followers are a representation of him and Dwarves are Smiths.  The rest of my post was to disprove the whole "Paladins always got the most" rumor.<P>&lt;&lt;Are you upset because 3 classes got more than you? (2 of which are dual weilding classes and are simply designed to have greater damage output and use more weapons than paladins)&gt;&gt;<P>Nope.  I'm upset that I don't have a Holy axe, therefore no goal to strive for.  I don't have the "Find your god's item" quest that many do.  My dual wielding argument is to show how game mechanics work in EQ.  No item that can be dual wielded is as powerful as an item that cannot be (at comparative levels.)<P>&lt;&lt;Are you upset because you don't have more weapons than everyone else?&gt;&gt;<P>No.  I was brining up warriors because there are forces that can make a weapon paladin, sk, ranger only.  They are called Gods/Goddesses.  What Force prevents a Shadow Knight from using a Painbringer?  Is it because it is divined by an opposing god?  If so, then a ranger and/or paladin would be able to use it.<P>NoseSocks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>geesh this guys understand nothing ? Look a simple example :<P>Lets say:<BR>Paladin got 10 weapons multiclass they can use at level 50+ and 1 weapon class only.<P>Ranger got 10 weapons multiclass they can use at level 50+ and 10 weapons class only.<P>Ranger can choose between 20 weapons. Easier to find. Price are Lower. Class only "usually" better.<P>Paladin got only 11 choice. Harder to find a weapon. Need to pay more for them. There is 5 (FIVE) Sword of Morning on all the Mithaniel Marr server. Probably 4-5 FA. Ok. Lets do the count 5 + 5, wow 10 paladins got one usefull paladin weapon only on level 50+ on my server. Others have to share all the mutilclass weapons.<P>Actually not ALL the 10 weapons multiclass are GOOD. Thats make it very harder to find a GOOD multiclass weapons vs others classes. By adding some weapons paladin only. Paladin will have something to look for.<P>Btw i dont complain because i need a weapon. I got a Polyphenomenal Axe (37/48) from the first week that loot table was screwed. I didnt heard of the drop anymore... I know 2 paladins that got one (including myself). I support all others paladins (yes we are not only 12 on mith marr) that need something to get for a resonnable efforts like others classes.<P>Rahan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

If you guys want to try and find someone to argue with, pick someone else.  <P>All I did was ask a few questions and suggest that it's not so bad. <P>I'm sorry for you all that you are upset and mad about weapons.  But don't even think of trying to take our your anger or frustrations on me.<P>If I wanted to be rude or simply argue I'd say "well if you want more weapons play a warrior" or "stop whining" or any of a hundred other phrases that would be totally infammatory.<P>The end result is that yall are unhappy with not having more weapons.  <P>The end result is also that many do not view quantity of weapons as the key to happiness.<P>I'm truly tired of every class wanting more, more, more, more.<P>The title of this thread is not "paladins need more weapons that have special stats to make us stronger in one handed combat"<P>Complaining that you do not have a greater quantity doesn't generate sympathy and it is apparently not what many of you want.<P>Simply because ranger have more clas pecific weapons does not mean that paladins are lessened by not having teh same quantity.  It is the *quality* of those weapons that count.  If you want to debate the quality of your weapons start a new thread.<P>Every class in Norrath wants more variety in weapons.  Plain and simple.  What makes paladins different?  I'm not saying you are not diffrent, I'm asking why you honestly think that paladins are different in wanting more weapons.  Like the onepaladin posted, he wants his holy axe.  And I can tell you with confidence that every player in Norrath wants something.<P>I'd be thrilled if verant gave every class exactly the same number of class specific weapons.  But it's not going to happen.  <P>And comment to your heart's content that I must have no clue.  Doesn't realy bother me.   I can tell ya that I've played every class in this game. I can tell ya that the guy next to me on the other computer is a high level pally as his primary.  I can tell ya that pallys can do amazing things without increased *quantity* of weapons.  I can tell ya that he's quite happy with what his paladin can do without needing 15 more weapons by sheer quantity.  I can tell you that when he reads this thread he just mutters "whiners" and moves on.  But since yall are too obsessed with your argument to believe anything said by anyone not waving your banner, it won't matter anyways. <P>Go back to your argument, but don't you even dare try to point at me as if I started it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Im sorry, but what you are saying makes no sense and has no relevence to this discussion.<P>Beucase of the lack of Kunark weapons, many many paladins are stuck using vastly inferior weapons like Ghoulbane post 50. A weapon most have had for 30 levels.<P>Quantity matters becuase the lower the quantity the less liklihood someone will get a weapons upgrade. And in fact many paladins have not gotten one MONTHS after kunark came out.<P>OF COURSE quality matters.  All the weapons I listed are better than most GOD dropped weapons.<P>Appropriate quality of weapons should be ASSUMED for any class.<P>Quality is not an issue.  It goes without saying weapons should be quality.<P>If you cant understand simple economics of scarcesity, how can you make a logical argument?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Nosesocks,<P>I did mention that I would be delighted if every class has the same number of weapons.<P>To expand that..<P>Given that creating 30 new weapons for every melee class would take no resources and detract nothing from efforts to improve areas of the game that benefits all users instead.<P>Just as the short race clerics (dwarf, gnome, halfling) gave up on hoping for clerical robes since it would take devlopment time from activities that could benefit a larger populace.  <P>It's all about balance and resources. Do I wish that paladins had 26 new weapons in kunark that gave greater variety in the same levels of weapon power that they already have?  Sure, given unlimited resources.<P>Trying to explain from a different perspective...  each class suffers in different ways.  Rangers discuss their damage intake non-stop these days.  Paladins were on the helm thing and now the weapon thing.  Clerics want some spells to just make life not med/heal/med/heal, rogues want poison to be more effective, monks want kunark armor, druids want quest armor, nbards want kunark armor that doesn't just summon water and food, etc, etc, etc.<P>If you look at it all, everyone wants something.  And it's demonstratable that if you give everyone what they want, it does indeed change game balance and they will all still come back in 3 months and ant more changes.  <P>The key is to find out which changs help the greatest number of players, are easiest to implement and have the least impact on changing the balance that exists.  Discussing a dissenting view of why the changes should be deemed top priority is hardly reason to justify the type of response that was given here.<P>So for me, all I did was ask why quantity mattered.  And I tried to point out that some other classes have valid issues as well that apply to the discussion in the global sense.  What I got, from people that propose to play noble paladins, is a lot of flak and insults.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The argument paladins get shared weapons so they should be happy is really not worth squat.  I remind people paladins have no extra way of dealing dmg (except undead spells which are almost totally useless).  When paladins are forced to use a 1H weapon that a warrior can duel wield with, it is such an incredible disadvantage.  Using 2 handers that SKs, warriors can wield is not as insulting, however not being able to bash while using one is another severe knock.  <P>SKs and Paladins, for example, should be exactly equal on both tanking ability, and melee dmg.  The only diffence should lie in our spell casting (sks more offensive, paladins defensive).  Also, look at what happens when a decent paladin weapon can be used by warriors (Rod of Mourning), it's so powerful it gets nerfed although it was appropriate for our class.<P>About Fiery Avenger, yes I use one, and it is still a very decent weapon...but it's not keeping up.  33/44 base is not handling it when there are 19/24 SK 1 handers and very awesome warrior and ranger duel wielding combos.  Again, of all the melee classes, paladins should be at the bottom as far as dmg output.  The gap though, is simply getting too large. <P>Dantiel    </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>1. They are used and they are fine. The problem is we have to roll against four other classes which makes them harder to get. There are less of them which makes them harder to get.  They are more rare which makes them harder to pay for or trade for.<P>Take the ornate runed blade for example. Its a great weapon for a paladin. But four classes can use it. Which makes the liklihood of a paladin getting one alot harder. Sure its equally as hard to get for an Sk, but if an SK cant get one he can try to get one of his 10 class specific weapons. A paladin only has one.<P>The issue is scarecity. The existing weapons are fine, there just arent enough to go around.  While other classes have plenty.<P>2. I think paladin damage is fine if they can get one of the new Kunark wepaons such as the Onate runed blade.  The problem is that weapons are alot more scarce for paladins than all other melee classes. Which means many paladins still use ghoulbane post 50.<P>Its an issue of fairness and availablility.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Thanks Dantiel,  good reply  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>But my question remains, the focus of interest is the quality of available paladin weapons in your statement.   But the majority of this thread is about quantity.<P>While quantity is a factor in scarcity and cost, the relative accessability of the weapons also is a dramatic factor in scarcity and cost.  <P>I have not seen posts here that say "Man I really want a Wonderous Superblade but there are not enough to go around."  I just see posts that say "Warriors and SKs and Rangers got more, therefore logically we deserve more".  It's a different point being made.<P>It's a truth that Verant will sometimes make concessions to certain races/classes to promote play.  A good example are some nice items for new Erudites starting in paineel.  Or perhaps the erudite only paladin shield in Hate.  They try their best to add some race and/or class specific treate to encourage more people to play certain classes.  For example, the count of high level cleircs seeme to be rising so I would expect any cleric requests to be sidelined or now. Conversly the number of DE clerics was extremely low by comparison and lo and behold, some interesting DE cleric quests and items appeard and there are more now.<P>I really do see verant's job as a cross between putting fingers in the dike and using treats to encourage folks.  But each effort takes time and resources.  The only point in discussing the merits of a change exists in discussing the merits of a change relative to what that time and resources could otherwise do.  <P>So questioning a request is a good thing, it keeps everything in balance.  Use the question as a way to exemplify the point and see if it has merit by stating your case.<P>Heck I love paladins and would be happy to see them with lots of nifty new toys.  But I'd like to know why any one class/race asks to be a priority over other issues as a matter of confirming the validity of a request as well as just general knowledge of why folks feel as they do.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ofbac:<P>While we may play paladins in game, that doesn't mean we're paladins in real life. I'm not posting as a 'paladin' on these boards, I'm posting as a person who plays the class. Does this excuse people being rude, short, etc.? No, not at all. However just as if you played a necromancer in game I wouldn't expect you to be trying to raise the dead in your basement, please don't expect me to be praying to Tunare in mine.<P>That said, the argument as I see it is this: it is many orders of magnitude harder for a paladin to get a 'Kunark upgrade' weapon than it is for any other melee class. The class specific weapons highlight this nicely, and would be the easiest way to make it a little easier for a paladin to upgrade from his GB.<P> It can very easily be argued that paladins do not need the weapon selection of other classes, due to the other things that they can bring to a group (healing, stunning, and buffing if no cleric). However, all 3 hybrids were designed as 75% warrior / 25% caster (or at least that is my observation over 69 days playing time and 48 levels). Ergo, doing damage and/or tanking would seem to be 75% of what we need to be doing. For paladins, tanking would be the majority of our warrior heritage, to do that we need good armor, but also good weapons, so that you don't wind up so far down on the hate list that the monster never even looks at you. It doesn't do me alot of good to have incredibly high AC but at the same time swing a 15/35 weapon (GB) to try and taunt off of rangers, monks etc.<P>As for 'use weapons that aren't class specific', this is a very good observation, but you can really only apply it to 2 handed weapons. If the weapon is 1 handed and we share it with a dual wielding class, it has been tuned for dual wielders, and not for paladins/SKs. <P>VADERflag:<P>Sodor was talking about bards with his '4 weapons in hate' comment.<P><BR>Note to self: don't post at work, its taken me over an hour to write this with all the interruptions =T.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Bottom line is New weapons=New Toys=Fun<P>People want new weapons cause they are FUN.  Kinda stinks when you are using the same weapon for 15 levels and have no end in sight.  <P>Fiery avenger is a pipe dream for 99% of pallys.  I'm in a big high level guild and I can't even think about trying to get it.  The books off the dragons is just ridiculus.  Come on please change this quest a bit.  Make it so a 50+ pally has a shot at it at least.  This weapon isn't overpowering and rangers/rogues/warriors can get a better item in one group/one nights camp.<P>Allow Paladins a few choices for weapons in RoK.  Let us reasonably dream about getting that great weapon.  Paladins whithout the BEST weapon in the game are patheic when it comes to damage dealng.  If you aren't gonna give us a great weapon, how about a really great shield.  Maybe one that procs a damage shield.<P>I love my paladin, but I am forced to play another class if I want to have ANY tyoe of power.  People like to be powerful, that is what drives people to play eq for hours on end.  When you put in all that work and have a weak character(due to lack of a decent weapon), it kinda hurts.  I am almost embarrased when my 50 pally is trying to kill a mob in front of people.  The damage I do with my Mith 2hs is sad.  A SK in my group with a mace of the ss made me look silly.  Sad also when a pet can make you look like you are throwing rocks at a mob  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>"It's a truth that Verant will sometimes make concessions to certain races/classes to promote play. A good example are some nice items for new Erudites starting in paineel. Or perhaps the erudite only paladin shield in Hate"<P>I play an Erudite paladin for one. I started him before the plane of hate was even open. I take great pride in the shield I weild, and can't thank enough the people who helped me get it. Therefore I'm never putting it down, and will never weild a 2h (other than Fiery Avenger  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> but I wont be getting any time this year) <P>What would be nice is a 1h weapon with sufficiant stats to keep up with what the other classes are duel weilding. Just powerfull enough to keep us up on the hate list.<P>I'm weilding a Ghoulbane now. The other day I was grouped with a ranger wielding a Crystalline Short Sword and Green Jade Broadsword (both better than ghoulbane). How on earth was I suposed to tank in this group? I tried everything other than flash of light (no one likes that). But when the ranger is doing 4x your damage it's *very* hard. If I had a sword of mourning I could have taunted off her, but those are so extremly rare (on my server) and expensive it's very unlikely I'll get one. Unless I get lucky and get into a group in Sebilis which happenes to be in the room where the sword of mourning drops. Then I hope no greedy people are in the group, and then hope it drops in the first place  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>**is getting sick and tired of wielding the same ghoulbane hes had for 24 levels now**<P>Bleah.<P>Cmon Abashi, please at least give us some glimer of hope that you guys are going to look into it.  We have almost no obtainable comparable paladin only weapons in Kunark.  The sword of morning drops too infrequently, and to quote a fellow paladin on the pally boards the Halcolyn (bad spelling) Broadsword is rarer then Calafornium.<P>Sir Derek Drygon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Why Do Paladins Get One Class Weapon In Kunark While Other Hybrids Get 9 for 50+<P>I think that you have some valid points, however the idea when Kunark items were being created, there was actually a shortage of weapons for the other two classes to my knowledge, and that's what was addressed.  You do make a good point about the WAR/PAL 1H weapons being designed with dual wield in mind.  <P>That said, it is possible that things swung too far in the other direction.  I'll bring the issue up with the designers.<P>-Gordon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>For those that keep mentioning all of the common weapons, remember that paladins can't use piercing weapons (which warriors, rangers, rogues, and shadow knights can use) and paladins can't use off hand weapons (I was in a group that looted some sort of claws that listed paladins as a group, but they could only be wielded in the off hand, so in essence paladins would never be able to use them.)<P>Paladins in the past have been labeled the group that has all of the holy weapons. I don't think it's unreasonable to wonder why there are so many more weapons for all of the other melee classes than for that holy weapon class.<P>I have a paladin that is level 51. Since I couldn't ever get a group and there were so little new equipment I could hope to get for him, I have played him next to none. For a one hander he has ghoulbane, the same weapon he's been wielding since level 28 (yes, I went to hate many, many times, only saw one mace ever drop, and lost the random on it.) For a two hander, he has a jade reaver, which is better than soulfire or theo claymore, but is one of the worst two handed weapons ratio and delay wise that one can get with a post 50 group. Even then, I didn't get the jade reaver until after I lost rolls to several rangers and warriors that basically wanted it for fun, since they had so many better weapons to use.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Good to see that they will look into it at least. It really is discouraging, especially in light of all the other issues concerning paladins at high levels now, that there are so few weapons available to paladins compared to the other melee classes, and beyond that that quite a few of them really aren't well suited for use by a paladin.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
