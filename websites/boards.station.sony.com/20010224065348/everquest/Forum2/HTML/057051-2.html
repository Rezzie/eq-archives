</FONT><HR>   **RANT WARNING**<P>First off, Phelan42 put your head back in you'r ass and stay off the boards. Read what this thread is about, you'r post had absolutely nothing to do with it. Also if you had half an IQ point, that first post would have made sense to you and it's obvious he is a hundred times smarter then you, his english is a thousand times better then your french.<P> With that out of the way, I will get back to the topic. First of all pre 50 necros are amazing, we dont need any changes there. Varant has stayed true to what a necro is in those levels. Where they screwed up was the post 50. Every other class has basically stayed true to form through out the 60 levels,it's just necros they have completely changed post 50.<BR> I don't think that we need any new spells brought in, we just need the spells we have to actually be useable. Three of our post 50 spells are so expensive they are virtually useless. Having to have a 45+ player lose 1 bub of exp just so we can cast a spell once is completely absurd. I may be wrong but I don't think any other spells in the game are anywhere near that expensive, not to mention have 3 of them. Unless we are part of an Uber guild that can farm 45+ players, we will never get to use these spells. I don't see a problem with making spells expensive but this is rediculous.<BR>  Then there are the spells that only work at night, now this is just plain stupid. Does Varant actually think that letting us invis or evac during the day is going to blow the balance out of the water? Like our soloing abilities are now going to go through the roof, give your heads a long hard shake varant!<BR>  Last but not least lifetaps on uber mobs. This will not effect our soloing abilities in the least bit, what it will do is help us with the "new role" on raids. It will let us do some damage and help us make the mana to be a battery, without taps we have no HP and without HP we have no mana to give.<P>  Another thing is the spell drops, why are necro spells so rare? We just have the same chance to get these as anyone else does. I have 3 backpacks of spells that have dropped for me in skyfire, only one was a necro spell splurt. I have multiple spells from every class.<P>  As for the uber quest, I'm not even going to touch this. If varant can't see the problem with this then EQ is a lost cause.<P>  I thing this would help the class alot without destroying any balance VI is trying to achieve, but I could also be talking out of my ass =). Sorry for the spelling but I'm typing this at work at work so I'm in a bit of a rush.<P>Quote of the day :<BR>  "WARNING: Lifebane's little rant.... Necromancers being the masters of fear do not have the ability to have our pets be immune to fear, yet the Mages after this patches in (assuming it will make it to live servers) will be able to make their pets immune to fear. Sooooo, Necro's already had the issue of not being able to land spells on Epic Mob's, and all pet classes shared the pain of useless pets that run away throughout the battle. Now however, the Mage's pets will sit and fight while the undead skeles run off in fear as always. Hehe... the vision = you are a manastone-o-mancer. *boggles at the logic*<P><BR>- Lifebane"<P> I hope Lifebane doesn't mind the quote but it's a perfect example of varants backward thinking.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Kierstaad_Unity<P>hahah<P>no, you won't be able to take 12 necros to kill trakanon.<P>Trakanon has 32000hp, meaning 12 people, if all cast truc 1x (10 minute recast) = 11000 damage.  So he has 21000 hp left, meaning you need to cast touch of night 30 more times, meaning 5 more times each.  Therefore the battle will have had to last 42 seconds.<P>If you think necros can live for 42 seconds with no tank support against a monster that hits for 650+ (with 600ac) then you got another thing coming.<P>If 32 necros went in, MAYBE.  but they'd have to all cast at the same time and hope it lands.<P>Mind you 32 wizards could probably do this too.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I play a lvl 60 Necromancer on Tarew Marr<BR>&lt;Epocsorcen&gt;<BR>I spend most of my time in big raids doing the following.<P>/pet kill (if its a pet friendly raid)<BR>/cast DMF<BR>/cast give mana to clerics <BR>And I sit in Arch lich ALL the time. If you change lich its only going to hurt the group or the raid even move, I cannot give my mana out fast enuf or often enuf , I'm always having to be healed. Makeing lich take more HP's will only take mana away from others. Makeing giving mana kinda pointless.<P>"fixing" lichis not wise.<P>IMHO there are 2 thing to fix necromancers on big raids / uber mobs.<P>Make Taps or some form of a 'nuke' NONE DOT spell ( so more then 1 necro is worth something ) work on uber mobs.<P>Give us more efficient Give mana spells and or full mana dump. Clerics and other classes can heal Hps MUCH faster then we can "heal" mana at way better rates.<P>In the Group or casual EXP / dungeon crawl. IMHO Necro's do fine with their 2 'heals' pet and taps/dot's. Changing lich to take more life would just hurt the groups mana pool healing the necro, or make necro dot's worthless because no nocro would use a none life gaining dot or tap because it wouldn't be mana/life efficient if lich took more life.<P><BR>Some things to add / help but are NOT fixes / solutions that I would like to see.<P>Group DMF.<P>Give us diff looking undead mobs to summon kinda like the mages get, Where our pet at certain levels would summon as Spec or Greater warbone etc. or when you hold Item X in your hand your pets will look like zombies when summoned etc. Make Charm last LONGER. Its BS when your level 60 and have a lvl 30 mob charmed and it breaks after 1 min. ( not that a lvl 30 mobs worth charming vs using a spec pet ) but basicly our charms worthless.<P>IMHO charm should never wear off untill you zone , die or the pet dies. We are 'masters' of the dead, we should be able to have total controll over 1 undead mob and not worry about it killing you when charm breaks.<P>change the stones used on our insta 1000 mana spell to something else, like fire opals black sapphires or multi peridots like 5 or 10 per cast( that would be a good money sink)etc. Its not easy finding people 45+ to eat a death for a essesnse emerald exp is to valueable. I can see it taking an essesnse emerald to do the necro res. But having it take one for a 1000 point tap or 1000 poing mana gain is just lame.<P>Fix our epic quest item drops , RARE dropd off 7 day spawn mob / god is just dumb. Theres like 2938439 shaman's , enchanters , clerics , rogues , etc all running around with epics on my server ( Tarew Marr) theres only 1 necro epic. I think the necro epic is too hard to get. I've seen Cazic die 7 times and not have the quest item.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Even being able to rez with our limited heal would be enough to be considered on the bigger raids.  Our survivability is much higher than a clerics which can be useful for the "break in" phase of planes raids.  Make the components those Tiny Jaid inlaid coffins, or if you want to make it tougher, make it the regular coffins.  The regular ones cost 175pp with my char gear.  They are 10 lbs, and they count as containers, so you lose inventory.  You couldn't afford to carry more than one on you, and Clerics do it for free so their rez would be the prefered rez.  Plus it would take some heat off of clerics for rezzing too.  Most Clerics 50+ go anon (i bet you can guess why).<P>Vaelik Radanavich of House Radanavich<P>54th necro (looking into a good 401k plan for my future retirement)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Well, here are a couple other useful changes imho:<P>1.  Make the level 57 summon corpse a level 50 spell, as SK's get the old summon corpse at that level.  Make the 39 summon corpse spell not require a regeant that is a container and therefore can not be put in a bag.  Thats just being punitive the way it is now.<P>2.  Take away Mage dot spells.. WHY did you give this to mages?  If they keep it I want Scars of Sigil or Call of the Hero.  Mages now have a better dot than we do.  As well as pets that are 3 times better and a huge variety of DD and AOE spells.<P>3.  Give us the upgrade at 49 to our Word series... at lower levels we get the same AE spells as clerics...but at 49 we get zip.. then clerics get Upheaval..  Why cant we have these upgrades too?  At least we could be helpful on AE raids with these spells.<P>4.  Let us use research post 50.  Why did we work so hard to get our skills up only to have you discontinue this skill?  I think a lot of necros liked researching spells.  Drop rates on necro spells suck to say the least..maybe we can get more into circulation with research.  If not, then make all class spells post 50 purchaseable.<P>5. Let us cast gather shadows on others.  Surely after 40+ levels of having this spell we will eventually figure out what other casters figured out 30 levels previously..give us an "improved gather shadows" at 50 also with a fixed duration self only like druids got with Improved superior camo<P>6. Increase the duration of screaming terror.  Druids and Shamans can substitute for clerics if the changes on test go through.. why can no other class substitute for enchanters?  Give us an AE sceaming terror at higher levels too.  Do NOT make it fear the target... geez whoever suggested that is dumb.  Imagine the trains using fear in dungeons.<P>As has been stated before, let our LIFETAPS land on mobs up to 6 levels higher than us like they used.  Let us have our duel wielding dagger speed buff back for our skeles. Damn our pets suck worse and worse all the time and mage pets get stronger and stronger.  How DARE you call us a "secondary" pet class? <P>I think there are a ton of good suggestions on these boards.  Necromancers are evil OFFENSIVE spell casters, dont keep neutering us.  I did a count of 54-60 necromancers on Veeshan friday night during prime time (2100+ people online)... a whopping 6 were on.. all the rest of us with higher level necromancers have either quit EQ in disgust or play classes which Verant favors over necromancers.. <P>Are you guys at Verant really that clueless on game balance that you think necromancers are "Powerful as is" and balanced?  If you nerf lich I plan on cancelling my accounts and moving on.. obviously you lost your "vision" somewhere along the way.<P>one of thousands of very unhappy necro's post 50.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just a little tidbit for the people who can't seem to grasp the point of Arch Lich...<P>It's not a friggin upgrade to Lich.  It's Lich and you finally get to look like a spectre, which necros have wanted because it looks god damn cool.  If you need the extra mana, you hit demi lich.  If you can "get by" (hah!  Poor c2 dependent suckers...) with Lich, then you can stay in Arch Lich and have the same mana ratio while looking rather dapper.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Before you ask for changes in spells, take two minutes and think why things are the way they are.  If you still don't agree with it after that, fine.  But jesus...  going through this thread, I don't think some people have any grasp on what exactly would happen if necros got what some people ask for.<P>Despite all the nerfs, necros still kick ass.  I know a lot of high level necros who feel the same as I do.  The pet thing... anyone still using their 49 pet all the time is a fool.  The damage output of the 53 and 56 pet (haven't gotten 59 yet so I can't speak for it :P) are why you use them, not to tank.  If you need your pet to tank, yeah, you fall back on 49.  If you have a smart tank in the group, use the rogue pet to kill things faster.  If you're on a raid or have dumb or multiple tanks, go with monk.<P>I don't think it's so much that people have valid complaints on a lot of things brought up here so much as people just don't bother trying to use them.<P>Spells that stink in their current incarnation :<P>Trucidation, Infusion, Ignite/Chill Bones (the novelty wears off), Track Corpse, Defoliation (at least a few more mobs that could be hit by it would be nice), Quivering Veil of Xarn (like Zrazzt says, why the hell would I want to worry about if it's night or not?), epic item effect.<P>Could probably throw in Enstill because we get it at a stupid point in our careers.<P>The other thing is being able to affect the uber mob.  I don't want to do the most damage, I don't even need assured shots.  I just want to be able to damage it.  If I can have fearless pets and chain cast them, that's fine.  If I can have lifetaps raised above where they are in resistability but below lures, that's fine.  Hiding around the corner during Trak is boring, and anticlimactic.<P>Other than that... I can't think of much more that I'd like fixed.  I have a lot of fun playing my necromancer still, even going on raids.<P>And to fit in here, I'd like to post an idea that my group and I decided would be a good idea while camping spore king...<P>Necros should get a DoT that has a chance to stun every tick.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>*bow*<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Some things I think would help:<P>1)  When a necro is grouped, allow double tapping of the necros group key to be able to target the pet.  This way Healers could target the pet much easier when trying to heal.<P>2)  Call of Bones and Lich spell.  When sitting down in skeletal form it gives a view "under" the zone and screws up the text in the chat box.  This needs to be fixed so that when sitting down, you sit "on" the surface of the ground..not under it.<P>3)  Group DMF would be very beneficial.<P>4)  DMF-  Allowing this spell to be used in Kedge Keep would be a big step toward making this spell even more viable.  One of the few underwater zones and the spell doesn't work there.<P>5)Increase range of pet commands.<P>6) Put in some vendors that sell bone chips as spell components.<P>7)  Big wish here...But I think it would be nice to be able to summon various pets that have some similar abilities to mage pets.  Maybe summon a ghoul type pet with root ability...or drybone skellies with DD spell..or Icebone skellies with cold DD spell...Mummy type with small disease dots...etc.  You could keep the tanking ability along the same lines or even decrease it slightly for these other effects.<P>Other than that, I agree with some of the other ideas presented previously.<P>Also, I don't believe that Lich/Call of Bones line of spells should be 'nerfed'..just fixed on the visuals that screw up when used.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"DoTs are inherently efficient spells but are countered by the duration of the spell. Allow all DoTs to stack and necromancers suddenly get exponentially powerful when grouping"<P>No - dot stacking would make necromancers LINEARLY more powerful when grouping, which is exactly the same thing that happens to wizards, mages, melee, etc etc.  Two wizards can nuke for twice the damage of one wizard in the same amount of time.  If dots stacked, two necros could also dot for twice damage in the same time, just over a minute or two instead of 3-6 seconds like a typical nuke.<P>But then, there would be a use for more than one necromancer, and we can't have that! :-).<P>And dots are not *that* mana efficient compared to higher level nukes.  Maybe instead of 3 to 1, they are in the range of 4 or 5 to 1, but they rarely run all the way through, so in practice they are often LESS efficient than nukes.<P>scr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>We are a powerful soloing class because we are pure casters with some self-healing and feign death.  Other than that, the illusion of the "vastly powerful necromancer" comes purely from the fact that IF we are outside with room to run, and IF the mob is fearable and darknessable, and IF there are not other mobs in the area that will jump us, and IF it doesn't regen too fast, we can kill it - and we can do it a faster than a druid kiting and with more mana left than a mage chaining pets and with less danger than an enchanter throwing charmed mobs at it.  <P>Post level 54 there are maybe three places in the game we can go to do this (a third of the mobs in skyfire, the sentient armors in wakening lands, and the rare blue spawns in burning woods).  Any necromancer that has tried can tell you the high hit points, danger, and low reward makes these incredibly boring and unworthy pursuits except for a dedicated few.  <P>I don't like that we're asked to give up group play, which is verant's vision for the game and how most people that aren't sociopaths PREFER to play, for this.  And we are.  We are not wanted in a high-level group because due to GAME pathing and control issues our pet is an everpresent danger to a group or raid.  Unlike mages we do not have damage-dealing capability or other group-friendly abilities (like Call of the Hero or damage shields) to make us wnted without a pet. <P>So, like my original and much longer post stated with details and reasoning:<BR>-Let us recall or control our pets better to will make parties/raids want us to "pet up".<BR>-Give us a Screaming Terror upgrade to make us a desired group member IF a chanter or bard can't be found.<BR>-Allow us to affect ubermobs with taps, even if it requires new and less-efficient lure-type spells.<P>If you do these things, you will fix the three main issues high-level necros have.  In my original post I state how this can be done without making groups more powerful or necros more powerful as a solo class.<P>Oh, and lose the night-only component on spells, I think you've seen EVERYONE agrees it is just silly.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok here is an idea I have for making necros more useful in groups without affecting our solo power.<P>Problem: dots are too slow for normal exp groups - creatures die in 20 or 30 seconds, not the 2 minutes it takes for the dot to run.  And making dots faster would make necros more powerful solo.<P>Solution: dot run time is determined by group size.  Specifically, dot duration = current duration / number in group.  So soloing, they are identical to now.  In 2 person groups, half the time.  In 6 person groups, one sixth the time.<P>So, take your typical 2 minute necro dot.  In a six person group, this dot will run through in 20 seconds, which is about right!  Most kills in 6 person exp groups take 20 to 30 seconds.<P>It still doesn't solve dot stacking of course.<P>scr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OK i have to respond to this being a necro.<P>First off forget any group spells. We are not shaman, clerics or druids. However it would be nice to have our spells castable on others and our pet. This would make us much more group friendly.<BR>Lets face it our pets suck at all levels. They arent the worst of pets but they are close. I have grouped a lot with a mage and see first hand what a pet is. Would be nice to upgrade our pets a little. A good idea would be to give higher lev pets better ac and stats. <BR>Health to mana spells. I dont understand why you would need to make them do more damage then they do now. I can easily kill myself with one of these spells if i an not careful. It doesnt stack with clarity like others such as shaman cannibalize. Necros and all pure casters dont have much in the way of health so it becomes very important that we be able to life tap or health drain dot to keep up health.<BR>Dots. Dots will never be allowed in any big raid until veriant comes out and states very clearly that they will never cause corpse to disappear. even then there are still not going to be trusted. They are also to slow to use in any battle except when soloing. Some faster dots would go a long way to groupability.<BR>Would be nice to put the lev 29 plant dd in game and take a look at what counts as plants for both that and higher lev spell.<P>Basically it would be helpfull for some group oriented changes. If you really need to make the health to mana spells do more damage fine just stop holding it over our heads.

</FONT><HR>I have long since given up on getting anything from Verant on getting things that actually make sense. Masters of the dead/undead? no, clerics are just as good. Our pets are just skeletons (now we have a spectre at level 60) not varied undead. Not more power, not less power, just varied looks and sounds. But no, we are not.<P>We start with the terrible resists and the like and they say there are no problems. they take abilities away, and call it balance. They see that we have come up with new strategies that they did not count on so they take that away from us by either banning it, downgrading our abilites, or upping the abilities of the NPC. All in all, I have not been happy with the decisions that have been made regarding the class. I still play it, because I am a roleplayer, and I roleplay the experience. I like that.<P>The one thing I would like to see change is one thing in specific that irks me to no end is something that is not power related. It is our Epic weapon. It has great stats. It looks terrible. I am sure that most have heard its more common name, the Duck Head Of Death. It looks stupid, and for that reason alone I dont really want one. If it were a staff of skulls, with a sarnak skull or dragon skull on top, that would look good. If it was like the Staff of writhing, but with a Velium head that had a glow, and little green skulls that float around it like the fear spell has, that would look really sweet.

Even at that high of a lvl I would prefer a self TP over all of the other lvl 50+ spells that are pretty much crap.  Our spells at 50+ are supposed to be powerful, and id glady give all my mana dump spells, Infusion, Trudication, Quivering Veil, and certian other spells for self-TPs over Norrath.  I cant stand the nerfing is my basic point, give us something better or at least better then our Mage, Druid, and Wiz counterparts.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi all.<BR>Well, I stopped playing my Necro at 50 because it was no longer fun trying to get into groups, and i left the game for a while, now i'm back i haven't bothered playing her until I see what 'improvements' will be forthcoming.<P>My thinking is this.<P>-- DoTs  have 2 versions of each DoT, make one of them identical EXCEPT reduce the time element it takes to do the damage, now make it so that these versions of the spell can ONLY BE CAST whilst in a group.<BR>Perhaps the time can be reduced by as much as 4 times, even up the amount of mana the spell takes so as not to step on the other damage dealing casters.<BR>Result?.. when solo, necromancers can still use our efficient spells, when grouped we actually have spells that have a chance to do some damage.<P>--Lifetaps... DEFINATLY need the resistance to these spells on UBERmobs looked at, even if they only stuck 30% of the time, the agro we get from them would easily balance things.<P>--pets. Please look into this whole placebo thinking of how powerful they are. yes fine, i can accept that when i 1st started out playing 2yrs ago, pets did seem mind bogglingly powerful, but PLEASE look into the power of pets post 50. take into account that 50-60 is supposed to be equivilent to 1-50 in terms of power and leveling, shouldnt the pets be slightly upgraded!!<P>I will continue to play my twinked rogue eager to see what 'enhancements' we get.<BR>*waves at Kierstaad!*<P>Cneajna Draconia<BR>50 Necromancer<BR>Prexus<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>JCDDreamer, I'll answer for Z.<P>No, if taps landed just fine, and, you got 12 necros, and the other people, no, the necros could not kill Trak. Why?<P>First off- pets are VERY weak to dragon fear, one roar, and time to cast another pet. The necro pet takes a LONG time to cast, and a good chunk of mana. <P>Then there is the DoT of Trak, this would wipe the pets out in 2 breaths.<P>Let's not forget the damage Trak does, with the DoT breath, pets would die even faster, since he will be hitting for full damage, and, pets have VERY poor AC.<P>Also, pets now work like a PC. Can you imagine 12 46th lvl warriors trying to tank Trak? You get the picture.<P>How bout necro DoTs? Only 1 per necro is allowed, 1 necro can do dark, one can do the high lvl Blood, one can do a disease DoT, one person can do Splurt, etc. The ONLY one that can stack is Envenomed Bolth, but I am sure Trak will shrug it off like water. An to add to that, the FASTEST DoT will take atleast 1 minute to do full damage.<P>Could 12 necros, and 6 others do Trak? Not on their best day, with all the most uber l33t equipment in the game.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Unlike many previous posts, I'm going to try to be somewhat logical about this, because I have so much faith in those in control here...<P>Necromancers' skills are fine. Our pets are fine (with the exception of my desire to use the 56 pet instead of the 60. that's just wrong...) Furthermore, our soloing ability from level 20-40 is almost ZERO. I'll lay every DoT I have on a green and get killed 20% of the time, because fear is resisted 100%. This brings me to my focus here...<P>A Necromancer's weakness (in respect to other classes) lies in spells. I remember when I was lvl 20-35 I used to go into a zone like highkeep or cazic and shout for an hour to a zone with over 100 people in it and would never find a group. I was lvl 30 for nearly two months because of my complete uselessness in even low-level groups. The only time I EVER EVER found a group was when I simply yelled "lvl 31 lfg" instead of "lvl 31 necro lfg". I had to /anon myself and everything.<P>Just out of curiosity, one day I timed a few kills in highkeep with a full group with my help and without. Having a necro in the group helping shaved a total of roughly 4 seconds off a 3-mob run. From then on in, when I'm in a group, I just sit down and watch the show. 90% of the time they don't even miss me. I started watching X-Files this season because of this... I can watch X-Files and move around a little during the commercial break so they think I'm still alive...<P>As a necromancer, I have absolutely nothing to do with the success or failure of a group (unless I try to use my pet when we have an enchanter, God forbid)<P>I feel hopeless beyond the capacity for rational thought on the subject, so all I can offer as suggestions are these:<P>-Don't nerf/fix anything else... We're already too weak to survive for the most part.<BR>-Make the lvl 60 pet worth using over 56. I trust you to do something creative... Just do SOMETHING.<BR>-Animals don't attack rangers. Why in the name of Inoruuk do undead attack necromancers? I mean, it just doesn't make sense given the relationship between rangers and animals...<BR>-and on a side note, what you did to Kithicor woods during nighttime years ago is horse sh*t.<P>That's really all I have to complain about, but if you want a good laugh, don't miss my post on the main board about verant customer service!!! It'll be a hoot! Those morons... Developers here are the only ones with a brain in their heads...<P>Phearox Gravewalker of The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>More on this: "DoTs are inherently efficient spells but are countered by the duration of the spell..."<P>This got me curious to look up the efficiency of DOTs compared to nukes.  Let's take a 49th level player and compare the two.<P>A 49th necro has a few dots he might use.  I don't know of any necros who cast the Cascading Darkness dot (we pretty much have to use the lvl 29 dooming dark), but let's compare everything handy.  For the necro we have, in order of damage/mana/cast-time/time-to-do-damage:<P>Cascading darkness(49): 1150/300/7sec/96sec<BR>Bond of Death(49): 720/360/7sec/54sec<BR>Asystole(44): 690/210/6.1sec/60sec<P>For wizards we have:<BR>Ice Comet(49): 1120/400/6.3/instant<BR>Rend(49): 784/280/6.3/instant<BR>Force Strike(44): 625/250/5.5/instant<BR>Conflagration(44): 625/250/5.5/instant<P>The necro spells are more efficient in terms of damage/mana, but not radically so.  The ratios on the necro spells are 3.83, 2.0, and 3.28.  The ratios on the wiz spells are: 2.8, 3.14, and 2.5.  And no necro that I've ever met uses the 49 darkness.<P>When you consider that in most group situations the necro spells do less than half their total damage, things start looking much worse indeed for the necro spells.  Cut those efficencies in half or in third then (not counting resists, which every class gets).<P>On the other side of the coin, the necros pet (in situations where it is permitted, and lives more than 2 rounds) is essentially a super-efficient dot.  Cast once for 500 mana, and he'll dish out damage until the cows come home, even when the necro is OOM.<P>But the point is that necro dots don't have some sort of super-efficiency compared to nukes.  If they were coming in at 6:1 ratios, then sure.  But they're not.  In grouping situations, nukes are far (far!) superior.  So superior that I generally don't even USE my dots except for the lifetap one so that I can offset lich and heal a little with pact.  I just don't mem them in groups, except for situations where, for instance, I am on snare duty (and then I use the 29 version, not the 49 version).<P>scr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
