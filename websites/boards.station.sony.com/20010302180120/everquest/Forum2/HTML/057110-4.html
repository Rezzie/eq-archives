</FONT><HR>Okay Verant, you wanted to finish balancing out the classes right? Well, now's the time to realize that it's not the classes which are so horribly unbalanced, it's your method of artificially creating downtime and extending travel time.<P>I would like nothing better than to get a few friends and go do a dungeon crawl through Nurga or Droga, or Chardok, or to find pickup groups in places like that. But you must realize what such an expedition would cost my group:<P>Considering a group of myself and my friends would look like this:<P>52 Druid<BR>51 SK<BR>53 SK<BR>52 War<BR>another 53-56 Mage, Druid, Cleric, Monk, depending who's online<P>So, what happens if our cleric can't come? Well, whenever anyone dies, they have to run from the nearest bind spot (Firiona Vie, usually, since tanks are the ones who die most frequently if they're doing their jobs right), and we have to either evac back out, or try to crawl back up the dungeon one member short, dragging his corpse along with us.<P>So, here is where the problem comes in. Where can we get a ress for this fallen group member? Well considering we're hunting in Droga for example, there isn't anyone usually there, considering it's so remote. What if we need a corpse summoned? We'd either have to try to convince a necro to walk halfway across the continent from Sebilis or Karnor's to summon the corpse(or Ress, for a Cleric), or wait for a guild necro to come online. <P>Side point: What if our guild has no necros capable of summoning a corpse? We are SOL.<P>And then we'd still need a cleric to ress of course (no dungeon raid is worth losing 12 hours of experience over, but that's a story for another post). <P>This means that the Kunark dungeons such as Droga and Nurga are cut off from the general population, in not one but two ways: no grouping classes around, and no utility classes around if we need assistance. It's bring your own lunch to these places. So what does this end up meaning? Only guilds with a lot of people, and free time, can do these types of dungeons without risking wasting their entire night on a corpse recovery in the middle of nowhere.<P>THAT is what is wrong, here.<P>And you wonder why no one goes to these places. What was it you said about Permafrost? "It is supposed to be hard to get to, supposed to be remote." Well, there's your problem. Hardly anyone is going to GO to this dungeon, since it is a 20/25-minute walk from NK (providing you have a sow) just to GET there. Granted it's at least POSSIBLE, since Halas isn't far off, and the melees can bind there. But the travel time still negates the possiblity of any pickup-group there, so only guild events will populate the zone. And guild events are usually only raids, not exp-groups. What was the old addage? The only time Permafrost has more than 2 people in it is when a) there's a fight over the Mammy Cloak camp, or b) a Vox raid. Simple as that.<P>I have to drive home a point here, before I end my little rant. People get bored of EQ because they are forced to hang around zones in which they are guaranteed groups. They are forced to by design; if they do not, they waste hours of travel time reaching a remote dungeon, only to find it empty. And then, since there's no one around to port them, they must RUN BACK. Want the players to spread out to these types of dungeons? Believe me, we'd like to. But some things have to change, first.<P>1) You have to get it through your heads that downtime != fun, and downtime != challenge, and downtime != risk/reward. Downtime is downtime, it is the anti-fun, and is to be avoided at all costs (which is why there are 150 people in LOIO every day...). I'm not talking about downtime after battle, I'm talking about downtime as in TRAVEL TIME. You're not doing anyone a favor by making zones so rediculously remote that a druid is a manditory class to have around if you want to go anywhere in less than an hour of walking. You're making the druids frustrated, and further unwilling to help others, by designing the game in such a way as they are bombarded with teleport/sow requests if they go un-anon.<P>2) End the silly thing with the boats already. All they do is kill time of the players. Is anyone having fun on those boats? Not bloody likely -- we can't even fish while we're on the boat. We can't practice spells either, since we can't cast on the boat. We can't trade on the boat. We can't even see other people on the boat half the time. Does making people wait 20-40 minutes just to get from one zone to another, whose only distinction is that in the fantasy world, they are seperated by an ocean, create incentive for teleports from wizards/druids? Darn right it does! And do you think these classes are inspired to help people more by the fact that everyone and their mother is always bombarding them with requests for teleports/sows? Darn right it doesn't! They become yet more annoyed, always anonymous, never willing to help except for exhorborant amounts of plat (To those of you not like this, I salute you, but wait until you hit your 50s). <P>What needs to be done, is to shorten the time it takes to ride on the boats. Maximum 5 minutes, not including load times (which can be up to 5 in themselves...). This doesn't take away from the desirability of teleports, but it does take away from the constant load on druids and wizards, making them more likely to port someone in need, since they'll stand out from the crowd. Long boat rides != fun, they are != challenge, they are just dead, wasted time, whose only purpose is to provide the illusion of some sort of inflated largess to the world.<P>3) We need more bind points. That is plain, and it is simple. Firiona Vie (and CoM?) are the only bindable zones in Kunark, and they are on opposite sides of the continent. If your tank dies, and you can't immediately find him a ress, you must wait an hour for him to run naked from his bind point to the dungeon. This inspires only dread of new places in people, and certainly does not encourage them to explore!<P>Finally, people play to have fun. They don't play to have to spend 25 minutes on the boat, trying to find a group. You must understand this. Would the world really be so horribly bad if you could jump from one city to another, as in the case with the firepot rooms? Don't claim realism as the reason: there are no mounts in EQ to speed up travel time, there are no player-operated boats besides canoes, and there are no roads except the ones you paint on the ground. At the very least, a travel system involving the firepots in TD, shortened boat rides, and more availability to travel-speed spells, would create an environment where remote dungeons may actually be populated!<P>What a concept!<P>Again, before I close, I'd like to say that I love nothing better than exploring new places, but not at the risk of a four-hour corpse recovery in hostile territory.<P>Thank you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>How about enhanced travel quests?  Portals or travel NPCs in every zone.  In order to use the portal or use the services of the NPC and travel to the destination you wish to go to, you must have the associated rune for that destination you've attained through some challenging quest, which would certainly include having travelled to that zone the old way - on foot.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Poster has pretty well summed it up for me. Down time is a major drag. when I log on, I want to PLAY, not spend half my time  traveling to play. On any given night, a dungeon like Kaesora will have 4-5 people in it on Quellious. Why? Its located in the field of bone, and it takes too long to get there to make it worth while. To quote Abashi, its about risk vs reward. Many other dungeons in Kunark have the same problem. Day after day, only two are getting used to any extent: 1) Karnors, 2) Sebilis. Karnors is a few minutes run from the only ring, and Sebilis is only 1 zone away from the Kunark evac location in the EJ. We are seeing server numbers creeping up steadily on Quellious towards the 2500 mark, and these dungeons are not going to be able to take the pressure. Add more teleport locations, and revamp some of the loot issues to make the outskirt dungeons more enticing. IMHO, the exp table changes were nice, but didnt do jack to affect usage. Easier travel to the locale WILL.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
