</FONT><HR><P>OK, I was a bit wary when I logged on last night for my first night of playing since the evil healing nerf. I was expecting the worst. I didn't get it.<BR>I visited three dungeons last night. First, I went to the hand room in Karnors. Post-51, summoning mobs. Had a monk, paladin, necro, enchanter, druid and me. No deaths. Yes, I noticed an increased aggro. Yes, I got summoned a couple of times. But the group had no problem pulling the mob off of me. At one point I even had to chain-remedy the chanter on a 3-hand pull. I got aggroed by one hand, the paly pulled it off me, no sweat.<BR>I noticed I needed to adjust my healing tactics slightly, and I was more on my toes, but no major change really.<BR>Next, we went to Kedge to kill Phinigel Atropos for an epic item. Got hit one or two times by a guardian seahorse and by Phinny himself. Again, they were able to be pulled off me. I haven't even used DA or DB as of this point.<BR>Then we went to the disco room in Sebilis. A monk, ranger, druid, enchanter, me and a magician. More summoning mobs. Also noticed the increased aggro, but only had to use DA one time.<BR>I only died once the entire night because our monk (and he admitted this) screwed up the pathing in the pull room and brought 12 frogs to us.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>That was it. Three dungeons, numerous post-51 mobs, a ton of complete heals, one death.<P>But you didn't kill Trak! Or VS! Or Gorenaire!<BR>I can hear the whiners now. It's always something.<BR>But seriously, with a good group (and these were all guildmates - people I've grouped with for 20 levels or more) the aggro wasn't that bad for me.<P>On the occasions when I was aggroed, it was nice to have that druid with his new, improved healing backing me up. We made a good healing team.<P>Kyri<BR>54 Cleric<BR>Morell-Thule<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I haven't played my cleric since the patch.  I have no desire to.  My idea of fun is not "One heal and die".  As a matter of fact, after being disgusted with the changes in the patch message, I've logged in for a total of about 25 minutes.<P>Frustration does not equal fun.  If playing my cleric now means getting killed all the time then I really see no reason to continue.<P>I know, I know...it makes no difference to VI as long as I'm still paying for my account.  I have a theory though.  One of these days there will be a title released that is better than Everquest.  A few have tried, but none have come close yet.  There WILL be one better though.  When massive amounts of people start going to the other game VI will loosen things up in an attempt to keep people around and the game will become fun again.  That is when I'll come back to play. So, if I cancel my account I'll have to start over when that day comes.  <P>Now, should VI NOT loosen things up when this better game comes out then I will cancel.  There will be absolutely no reason to stay around then. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

And if you find out you have to run way too far to go around and it is more efficient to throw it down, then start to complain about it.  (I.E. Not playing your cleric just because of what you hear without trying to find a solution yourself is not really bright.

</FONT><HR>Kyri,<P>In your proclaiming of the non-problem, you pointed out two distinct things.  One, you had a backup healer... this is now effectively mandatory (and I'm presuming that you'd agree that this goes against their stated goal of reducing the "mandatory" slots in groups).  Second, you were in a team that didn't require chain-CH casting... you indicated chain-remedy, but never chain CH.<P>Once again, in any situation where CH is a mandatory necessity and not just an efficiency improver, you will see dramatic changes to your agro... and your death.  In any situation where CH is a luxury, and used because it is more efficient... you'll experience precisely what you experienced last night.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Kyri - <P>53 cleric here, I posted a similar message yesterday about how I wasn't having problems, and pretty much got flamed for it... At this point it seems like the definition of when the CH nerf kicks in is slowly shrinking.. i.e., some people post dying horribly in typical 50+ exp areas. Then other people report having NO problems in the same areas, and we're (retroactively, by even higher level people) told those areas don't really count.<P>For the person who mentioned Dragon Necropolis.. a relatively prominent cleric in the community reported no problems in that very location last night... <P>The possibility that the hate changes are currently different from server to server is a possibility that's been mentioned to explain these discrepancies. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Kyri-MT,<P>You're talking about an xp group. Many of the mobs you fought in those areas are under level 51, as well.<P>The concern is about large raids, and mobs around the 65th level, not 52nd level. Some important differences:<P>1) Your mobs double for 140, mine quad for 850. This means that you die in 30 seconds and I die in 3.<P>2) Your mobs are Tauntable, mine do not respond to Taunt at all.<P>3) Your mobs are slowable, mine are not.<P>4) Your mobs are rootable, mine are not.<P>5) Mem blur is a viable option for you. If we tried to mem blur one of my mobs, not only would it more than likely not work, if it did, the mob would regain a tremendous amount of hitpoints due to being unagro.<P>In conclusion, you are only level 54 and do not have any understanding the truly high level encounters. Therefore, you have no place to speak on this issue.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Gbeq - When there are just as many anecdotal reports of clerics getting slaughtered in these "exp group" scenarios, clerics like Kyri and I absolutely do have a place to speak on this issue even if we're "only" mid 50s. <P>Unless there is something screwy on a server-to-server basis, you can't have it both ways - if you're going to disregard reports like ours out of hand because we're not getting "quad for 850" (sigh), then you have to disregard ALL cleric reports in non-uber encounters, including the people who say they ARE getting beating down in Seb, Karnor, etc. <P>This little contradiction is not doing much for cleric credibility. I'd rather see clerics trying to get ALL the information out there instead of trying to discredit their colleagues who are "only" level 54.<P>Sheesh. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, I've tried it out with two good play sessions, one in Old Sebilis, fairly deep in (disco 2); and the other in the Plane of Fear. For these types of encounters, the changes are fine. I actually like them because they do make clericing more interesting.<P>The big problem you have to look at is what happens to the people fighting high-end Velious mobs? There is no strategy that works other than chain-CHing on those mobs, simply because it's the only spell in the game that can keep up with the damage, and even then only when you have 4 clerics per warrior timing spells so a CH lands every 5 seconds - and this now gets a cleric killed instantly in these fights. This group is basically facing a situation where no matter how good they are these encounters simply can't be done. This regression of ability does not make the game more interesting for those players. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My experience with the change in agro was ok, as long as I was using Celestial Healing instead of CH.  I actually haven't used much of CH at all since I have never slain a dragon, god, or any of the high level group encounters in Velious.  Celestial Healing with a balanced group will work in many situations.  The timed effect of the heal is a way to deal with the problem of increased agro of CH.<P>However, Celestial Healing will not be enough for encounters in the planes or reets and jugs and stuff like that.  Things will start to get especially crazy on a royal raid for instance.  I'd like to see the Celestial Elixer lowered or perhaps a new inbetween spell introduced to help with an increased boost of hps needed in these areas as well as control agro on myself.<P>I don't mind so much the increase in agro on CH, but since I don't go to encounters where I'm quad hit for 850 I can't speak for those people.  I can totally see what they're saying though so I won't flame.<P>Boroque<BR>56 Templar of Brell<BR>Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>People, these changes have no effect on 51 and below mobs.  Try going to a boss mob of some type, and them come back and say your pleased. You can be worthless, just like other classes have been complaining about in the class talks ; what does verant do about it? they make more classes worthless.  I used to love going to Skyshine with one high level group and fighting up to red con mobs with one group, now, that is not even an option. <P>We are all not as good as FOH or the other guilds but I know my guild will be fighting some of the same mobs in the future that they are fighting now. So this change will hurt all us in the end game.   <P>I started a cleric after playing a druid to 50 because our guild needed clerics for big raids.  If I have lost the ability to contribute to the guild on a big raid, whats the point of playing anymore. Clerics are very boring as is.  And starting another character is not even an option for me, I did not slave through 60 levels just to start another class. <P>Verant should just be looking to avoid these mistakes for EQ2, not trying to change the entire game engine two years later. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

You've got two groups of players the power-gamer/uber monster group and the group that just wants to play.

</FONT><HR>Kyri:<P>You isolated a couple of things.  You popped into three places for quick runs.  Not too significant really.  And look at your group...you probably have not really used CHeal much with a Monk, Paladin, Necro, Enchanter and Druid in a party.<P>For the last 24 play hours, I have been exp. grinding.  It IS taking a good bit more mana to handle the post 51 mobs.  My favorite SK is taking a lot longer to taunt things off of me.  I am getting summoned more often.  Downtime IS up. Along the way, I have been watching clerics dying a good bit more often in encounters that usually would not be quite so lethal...including me.  Essentially EVERY encounter has been made tougher.  The taunt changes do show up.  And the Healing aggro is too much - especially with taunt being less effective.  But, this is not unresolvable.  As long as you don't HAVE to use CHeal.  <P>CHeal on the other hand, is not good.  Massive aggro occurs if you CHeal.  This means a puller who took a beating and comes in and you are not going to CHeal - or else you will die.  Been there and Done that.  But really only affects you when you have a warrior pulling...and in the fact you will use up a good deal more mana to heal.  So you don't use CHeal.  Now note in these encounters, you can cope but it is costing you more mana.  And the healer is at greater risk. THIS MEANS MORE DOWNTIME FOR EVERYONE.  MORE SIT ON YOUR BUTT AND MED TIME.  LESS EXPERIENCE IN THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME.  And Kyri, you may enjoy spending weeks picking up a blue bubble.  I don't.  I WOULD like to see 60.  And I am tired of arbitrary timesinks being tossed at us.<P>Now if you are not going to use CHeal as a cleric, I feel a shaman is a much better choice in a party.  Turgurs reduces damage taken in a fight to a fraction of what it is normally.  Means much less healing mana used and much less risk.  ANd now, you can taunt off the shaman by just healing him.  More than makes up for the extra buffs clerics have (which could be cast by one cleric for several groups - same with Rez).  The pet gives the shaman much much more damage capability than the cleric without excessive mana use.  Malosi and Cripple really debuff the mob.  And Shaman's regeneration spell heals 2250 points over 15 minutes.  In short, Shaman wind up being a much more mana efficient healer than the cleric without CHeal.  And I tell ya this...if you are going to be summoned to a mob, its a whole lot more comfortable if it is slowed way down.<P>Velious is a very different situation.

</FONT><HR>Well, some additional good questions/points raised...<P>1)  Is the result of the CH nerf "fun"?  Do more players get enjoyment out of the game now?<P>2)  Is it really a good idea to attempt to extend the lifespan of your game by artificially changing the rules of the entire game halfway though the lifespan of the game?  Isn't that basically the game design equivalent of making your players walk through a huge maze in order to extend the "time to complete"?<P>If the answers are no (which I believe they are), then REGARDLESS of whether a_cleric_01 thinks the changes can be overcome readily, this was a very very bad design decision.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Asbor..<BR>My qiestion is, when new tactics do eventually come about to win the day even with the new changes...<P>how long will it then take for those tactics to be nerfed?<P>Especially, since the changes are nearly always for the 50+ crowd? Just what percent of the customer base is 50+? 10%? 15%?<P>Wouldnt it be more cost effective, and please more customers, to fix problems that affect everyone, and not just 10% of the population?<P>Yes, a number of the changes that recently went in affect a lot more than just those top players, but there is a history of VI spending the majority of resources on the minority of players.<P>Instead of worrying about  making sure 1 or 2 battles a day on any given server, why not fix those bugs that have been around forever? Why not make quivers usable in the ammo slot? Why not fix the falling-death bug? etc etc.<P>please, put as much effort into changes that affect everyone as you do the minority. Only makes sound business sense. We have all heard the talk, the easy rhetoric, but lets see some real action here. Lets see as many improvements to the sub-46 game as there are for the 46+ game.<P>talk is cheap, and many of us have had enough of it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>JubalClericofTorv wrote:<P>&gt;"The big problem you have to look at is what happens to the people fighting high-end Velious mobs? There is no strategy that works other than chain-CHing on those mobs, simply because it's the only spell in the game that can keep up with the damage, and even then only when you have 4 clerics per warrior timing spells so a CH lands every 5 seconds - and this now gets a cleric killed instantly in these fights. This group is basically facing a situation where no matter how good they are these encounters simply can't be done. This regression of ability does not make the game more interesting for those players."&lt;<P>We are looking at this situation.  There's a sort of the chicken and the egg thing going on here.  Tuning the mobs would change the way that the healing aggro change works, changing the aggro thing changes how the mobs need to be tuned.  The thing is, every time we set up an encounter that seems way too hard, players prove us wrong.  When we set up something we think is tricky, one or some of the 300,000 + players finds it easy to do.  You guys are always able to come up with a way to make things work.  You're tricky people.  And once the 'trick' is known, soon enough everyone is doing it (or trying to do it).<P>I find it very hard to believe that after two days people have given up trying to work with the change.<P>And I'm not really happy that people are painting this as the end of all clerics.  The only place where it really seems there might be a problem is at the very high end game, with the very hard hitting NPCs.<P>Straithlin wrote:<P>&gt;"And that's the problem Verant but you don't understand that. Granted there is a group of players who don't mind, but Honestly, we're sick and tired of needing to relearn tactics. I'll gladly take the challenge of learning how to beat a new monster, but I'm disgusted that every time I turn around and you change the AI, that I need to relearn how to beat the same monster I've already learnt how to handle."&lt;<P>Well, personally, I strongly disagree with this.  As a player, I want as many new challenges as I can find.  Having monsters that adapt and learn makes for one hell of a great game.<P>&gt;"That's not why I bought this game, it's also not why many of us did."&lt;<P>I can't argue with that.  I can only tell you that when I bought EverQuest I wanted a changing world, an evolving game.  I know plenty of people who wanted the same thing.  And I can't see the difference between fighting a new NPC that acts differently and fighting an old NPC act differently.<P>&gt;"You've got a serious problem. You've got two groups of players the power-gamer/uber monster group and the group that just wants to play. Every time you do something to satisfy group one, you make group 2 more and more upset and angry and closer to wanting to pack it in."&lt;<P>Again, I disagree.  The group that 'just wants to play' will just play.  They'll adjust to changes and keep playing.  You're not talking about the difference between 'uber' players and casual players here.  You're talking about the difference between those who want a game to evolve and challenge them and those who want it to be comfortable and familiar.  You'll find both types of people in both the 'uber' group and the casual group.<P>As for this specific change, it's mostly the uber players who are seeing any change at all.  For pre-50th level characters the change is only somewhat noticeable.  And, for that matter, for most post 50 encounters this change is not such a big deal.  It's only in the case of certain encounters, the uber ones, that people are having trouble adjusting.  That may indeed mean that we've pushed that part of the change too hard.  But it might not.  For you, it doesn't seem to matter if it's too much or not.  For you it seems to only matter that it changed, and you don't want change.<P>I know that many people don't like to hear me say this, but it's the truth.  Healing aggro was broken.  We need to fix it to make the game right.  I hold to the truth that a game isn't good for anyone if the mechanics aren't right.<P>We are pretty happy with the change.  There may be some fine-tuning needed for a few encounters.  We'll be looking at those specific encounters and making decisions about them.  We might make changes to those encounters.  We might make changes to the aggro effect.  Or we might leave it as it is.  But those specific areas will be looked at.  Over all, we're pleased with the way things are working.<P>I encourage you all to get used to the new mechanic.  Try out some new strategies.  There are some tactics that clerics can learn from wizards here too.  I have no doubt that, given time to adjust, you'll find that this was the right decision.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You mean to tell me that when I cast CH on TankX that was attacking Velkator that I imagined getting squashed for Quad 850? Or casting Word of Vigor after a Trakanon AE didnt cause Trakanon to Blind and Shroom me all those times? Or even the hundreds of times a froglok has turned on me after healing the chanter was imagined also? Youre Telling all this was BROKEN?<P>Oh and now that Tanks will be able to cause less hate from the Proc Nerf(not to mention the so called "fix" on defensive that wasnt needed) and Clerics will be able cuase MORE hate than they already did, basically comes down to clerics will always be first to die and damn near instantly.<P>Verant, this is single handedly the most detremental change you have made in EQ. Your incompetance becomes more and more astonoshing each and every patch. Dont get me wrong, there are nice changes in todays patch like the added spells and such. You claim you dont want to make sweeping changes like(gasp) add new spells or skills, but then you go and make changes as huge as this, completly revamping higher level combat.
