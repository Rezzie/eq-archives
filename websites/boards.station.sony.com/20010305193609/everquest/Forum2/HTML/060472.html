</FONT><HR>Alleged KSing problems were that way.  Verant claimed that Wizards have to be kept down and resistances had to be raised and root had to be nerfed because of 'rampant' KSing and the volume of complaints.<P>Of course the fact that Wizard complaints ECLIPSE this has no bearing.<P>You want to know where the KS wizard complaints came from?  I saw a CLERIC get called a dirty KS wizard once... because he fired a spell at a monster.<P>Start on a brand new server, first day.  Run around with your level 1 guy using his guild weapon and watch the shouts and OOC about ks'ers and whines about how awful they are.  You know what is happening?<P>Warrior runs toward a rat, with intent to kill.<BR>Shaman sees rat and begins casting.<P>Warrior reaches rat, shaman spell hits, rat runs off.  KSER!!!!<P>The fact is, changing the kill credit to the group rather than highest damager eliminated this as a real problem (note: Verant fought against doing this for months, even though players said it should be in even in Beta).<P>My personal suspicion is that it isn't unsolicited comments from players, its Verant staff playing that comes up with these problems and complaints.  Just because they happen to work at the company doesn't make them any more mature nor balanced in their view of things.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think the few dozen people that Gordon was referring to was the Live Team.  Remember when the thread when the BP was first discussed about being nerfed, Alan said there was a heated discussion among the team and that in fact several memebers of the team were still unsatisfied with the proposed changes...hence the increased aggro on heals...<P>Just my interpretation.<P>However, what I think they should have done was increased the aggro on the PC being healed...kinda like war's beserker str of some sort..enabling the MOB to do more damage after a certain amount of healing had been done on the PC. Although the hate for the healer should be increased as well, I don't believe that automatically healing the PC should turn the aggro onto the caster.<P>again, my interpretation<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Guys, if you don't like Abashi or Absor or Aradune then go somewhere else.  There are other games.  They own the game, if they feel they need to change it to be more balanced, they can do that.  It all boils down to, that you piss and moan they do something you don't like, yet you still pay the ten bucks a month and you play EQ.  Three choices.  One, Play a different character, two, go play a different game, and three just be quiet and play the game.  Most people, probably could care less about this fix.  Considering it is mostly clerics saying that the last patch ruined EQ, then I would think it would be a safe bet to say that a majority of the players are happy with the changes.  the only problem I saw was them giving rangers sow at 30 when there were posts by brad saying they weren't going to do it.  You know it has been shown that usually two to four percent of the population will complain about something they do not like.  All the while you will never hear a peep out of those guys who do like the change.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Guys, nothing we do is based solely off of info on this board.  That would be irresponsible as I think that most people would agree that the sentiment here isn't always unbiased.  What the posts did do was get us to look at complete heal and see what made it "so good".  Essentially what made it so good was that it allowed a cleric to heal a ton of hitpoints without being responsible for that heal.  <P>In spells, as in weapons, armor, quests, etc., ideally there's a balance of risk and reward.<P>-Gordon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>So Abashi, you balance uber mob encounters around the fact that CH will be used and use A LOT.  Then you largely remove the ability to make use of CH.  It's a death sentence.  Not only that, shamans and druids get higher heal spells so the cleric's only claim to fame is CH and rez.  Oh wait, he can hardly use CH now.  He just dies.  Cleric now equals rez machine.  Time to switch to a shaman/druid everyone.

You have adjusted half of the equation, but forgot to scale the other half, leaving an unbalanced equation.  Why didn't the same patch that scaled UP the agro scale DOWN the hitpoints of the boss mobs over 32k?  I mean, more than 32k is more than a "ton of hitpoints," it is a freakin' PLANET of hitpoints.  All scaled for Tanks being healed by clerics using the breastplate.<BR> <BR>I think people in the high end game like death to be a rarity.  For most people, the excitement comes from the close escapes.  Verant seems to like "grading on a curve," which translates into "x deaths per level are challenging and fun."  <BR> <BR>One of the fun parts of the high end game are those close escapes via Complete Heal.  Did the Cleric cast in time?  Man, that Tank's hitpoints are low!  One fizzle, one extra hard quad hit, and the Tank is toast.  Then BING!  The hitpoints shoot up, everybody starts breathing again, the Cleric sits down with a little smile on his face, and the fight continues.<BR> <BR>What's your scenario?  "The vastly overmatched but valiant little band struggled, but to no avail.  Songs were sung in their memory, and Necromancers of the highest caliber were hired to summon their corpses from the inconquerable beast's lair.  An attempt was later made by 30 stout Warriors to suicide rush the Beast, but reality became strangely choppy and then the Warriors disappeared one by one from the staging area, victims of the dread scourge disease, Link Death."<BR> <BR>I like the game better with Complete Heal.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
