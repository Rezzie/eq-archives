</FONT><HR>Has anyone noticed the other nerf placed on archery as of the last patch?<P>Before the last patch, you could cast a spell (root or nuke), then immediately fire the bow.  What this allowed was a nice combo of shoot and nuke while the mob was rooted--the delay on a Trueshot bow and recast time on Ignite were so close you could effectively alternate 37 and 22 damage easily and continuously.  What did it add up to?  Soloing capability in the low to mid 20's.  Nothing more, and definitely nothing overpowering.<P>Well, now you have to wait until your recast time is up before you can fire the bow.  No more Root & Shoot & Nuke.<P>I don't see why this was changed, since any mob that cons high blue or higher would break root after about 4 rounds of shoot/nuke, and everyone knows what happens to rangers who try to melee down a high blue.<P>In all seriousness, what this has forced me to do to solo is the type of kiting that Verant terms as cheesy:  Snare, then nuke until I'm OOM, and proceed to bow-kite until the mob is weak enough for me to melee without dying.<P>And yes, I noticed that you can no longer auto-aim.  I'd love to see what an archer, IRL, would look like if he tried to shoot something without taking careful aim.  Next thing you know, they'll force us to stand perfectly still (just like hiding) while aiming!   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I was kiting a mob with snare and bow, when low and behold I can no longer get off a shot right after I cast the spell. WTF is this ****? After that last patch Verant decides to nerf our bow skills, as if we weren't nerf'ed enough already. And the ****ty thing about is they don't bother to tell any of the players because I think it's a significant change.<P>Hey Bashi! Why don't you answer some of these posts about this topic? I want to know why the hell this was changed. It's not like we had some sort of advantage of being able to fire off a shot immediately after casting a spell on a mob. Our melee (I hit for about 4 - 6 damage on average now) and fizzle rate (I fizzle a good 45 - 60 %) is bad enough, but now you want to take away our bow kiting? WTF is that?<P>So get off your asses Verant Customer Service and let the Rangers know why this was nerfed, or if it's a bug!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>It's actually more broken than all that, you have to wait like 2 ticks past the spell "recovery" time to fire at a minimum & have the arrow actually shoot. You can actually cast again before you can fire an arrow it's so bad.<P>That being said the tester folks are aware of the situation & have reproduced it (not too tough), and have passed it to whomever the archery coder is. (I figure he's some half-blind gnome who lives in the VI basement who lost an eye at an early age to a suction cup arrow shot at him by his big brother, and who thinks all bows should have a 5 day waiting period & have a nerf ball for an arrowhead.)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

No matter how long I wait, whenever I click on the button for the ranged attack the first time after casting, it doesn't do jack.<P>I literally have to click on the bow attack button (of course nothing happens), wait for it to go through the cycle, and then click on it again for an arrow to be shot.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I'm no expert on bows, but I think I saw the effect you are talking about.  My warrior took a shot, and was turned slightly to the side.  The arrow curved to hit the target.  This is like how a mage bolt spell travels.<P>As a mage, I learned to use that "curve ball" effect to shoot around my pet when soloing.  If the bows now do the same thing, you may have a new trick at the cost of an old one.  Try it for a bit while Abashi looks into it, you may find uses for it.<P>If I'm wrong about this, then just ignore this post.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I don't know what you guys are talking about,  I'm a level 39 ranger, and started bow kiting at level 13 when i made my first trueshot longbow.  I have never been turned in the direction of the MOB when firing my bow.   and as far as the last comment about having to wait for the bow to recycle before you could shoot again..  well the actual change is that if you cannot fire your bow due to range or what have you,  then there is NO recycle time you can keep tapping the button until you get close enough or your spell is cast at which point the bow will fire.<P>I REALLY don't know what this autoaim mumbo-jumbo is,  like i said i've been bow kiting off an on since level 13 and have never been turned in the direction of the MOB,  the only similar thing that i have seen is the arrow tracking the mob if it runs to your left or right at all after shooting,   and that still happens.<P>Ranger Rikk Wolvenkin<BR>Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well, if you never saw it, then im sorry - I guess alot of people post here. But now that we've caught your attention, here's a few questions on Archery and the Ranger:<P>What was the reason behind double damage after level 50? Why was our hopes raised? I had put all this to rest ... Archery has always been for pulling mobs to me , nothing else. No real damage done to the mobs with the bow and arrow. If your answer has anything within the range of the subject, "avoid kiting with the bow" - My answer is; In order for an arrow to do the damage a Kiting Wizard, Druid, Necro (who whom ever else) , you would have to put alot more than just double damage to a "Stopped" mob, I mean ALOT more! <P>I can't say much about other classes, because i havent played them, 'cept i have a fairly high level Bard, and a Shaman - which i am very happy with. They can work alone or in groups (UNLIKE the Ranger, which must be in a group)<P>Another thing i've noticed: all the GM's and other top brass on the servers, are never Rangers! and, for example, the other night, I did a "WHO ALL 50" and up to 60 on my server- from 50-53 there were 2-3 rangers (including me)  after that, NONE. Why is this so? is it like that on the test server? maybe there is just no interest on behalf of the programmers and the test-players for the Ranger class? <P>Time paddles along, things change , other classes get nice things (Spells, Items) ... Please tell me, what was done to BENEFIT the ranger class? <P>I bet some of us know more about the problems with the class we play than you all do, I've seen a ton of posts here with alot of problems and GOOD solutions - and so far the only recent apparent solutions were "JOLT" (a level 55 spell)  and Double damage , as far as im concerned, those two were no solutions, as Jolt MIGHT benefit at level 55+ Ranger(what about the other 54 levels?), and Double - damage didn't even benefit the 50+ players it was intended for. NEEDLESS to say, NO ONE in the everquest message boards suggested these as solutions to the problems.<P>Call me a Whiner if you wish.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>well i never had that auto aim thing happen for my warrior and he is now 40. but i do have one problem. i recently upgraded his bow to a 19/41 compound darkwood rng 150. before he had a ashwood bow i think range 125 16 dmg. Well the problem is i cant pull crap. im hunting the same place i was before but the arrows seem to shoot into the ground more. if there is any kind of elevation plane that the mob is on forget it. my other bow use to wrok here and this one does not. Im hunting at the BW zone in FM and there is a slight angle there its very very very annoying. I have to run up toi the mob and engage it with my weapons i cant pull it worth a crap anymore. But after i engage and run backwards firing at it i hit 99% of time. Somthing is definately messed up here. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>ABASHI :<P>So you know there also was a fix put into bows to stop their dmg/delay from being hacked (yes I read other msg boards :-).  For whatever reason weapons could not be hacked but bows could be.  People were claiming to have 255 dmg/ 1 delay bows and the ability to take down HG's at level 15.  One person claimed to have done level 15 - 30 in around 2 hours.<P>This fix may have affected something else in the bows.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

It has been reproduced &lt;and we were TOLD&gt; and it is being forwarded up to be fixed &lt;AND we were TOLD&gt;  that sure SEEMS like *10* responses ATLEAST to me.  and I'm sure there have BEEN SEVERAL more posts on the BUG board as I have not read it all weekend<P>Renkana<P>PS.  to the person who STARTED this thread, you either A. KNEW about the posts that I mentioned on the BUG board and just wanted to make groundless accusations at verant or B. you DIDN'T know and next time before you start making all these wild accusations maybe you should DO SOME RESEARCH AND SEE IF YOU ARE EVEN *RIGHT* about Verant's SUPPOSED lack of response.  and in this case you were 100% ***WRONG***  <P>Besides, Abashi...  I didn't realize YOU were the BUG liason from Verant.. I could have swore that MANY times it has been put out that ESTER is filling that position.<P><BR>thanx all and go play EQ instead of pouting here<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

My bow had to recycle again before it would shoot.<P>I think this began happening after the patch where the bow didn't grey out if the target was out of range.

</FONT><HR>Similar to Pexcer a few posts above, I have a level 40 ranger.  I have been using archery since level 6 or 7.  I have never been turned to face the mob while firing.  As a matter of fact, I have had to intentionally turn to keep the target in view.  Also, my arrows have always tracked or curved toward a mob that is moving.  I've been playing this character for 9 months, so most of this characters played time is previous to this archery patch.  I am making this post to point out that there is apparently a discrepency in the way some characters functioned pre-patch.  There is certainly a need to check into the issue.  I, for one, have always liked being able to plot a back up direction while firing my bow.  Also, I agree with Whatyamean, the tolerances for being too far above or below should be looked into.  Very often, I can't shoot because of this issue when it seems like it should be a very plausable shot.  For example, in the rathe mountains, I'm trying to pull a hill giant while we are both on the side of a grade.  I am just a very slight bit above or below yet I can't shoot.  If I am not on the grade and shooting the giant from the flat while the giant is on the same grade I can sometimes shoot it even though the giant is farther above me than when I'm on the grade with it.  In these same circumstances, I can use any of my spells as long as they are in range.  In my opinion, if a line of sight spell can be used, then why not an arrow in the same conditions?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
