&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I want to point out a couple of things that I think Absor is missing or is incorrect in his assumptions. <P>Absor states:<BR>&gt; My personal opinion is that enchanters shouldn't have any undead illusions, that should all be left to the necros and their type. <P>Unfortunately as stated elsewhere this cat is already out of the bag, and while I value your opinion it really doesn't have anything to do with the true discussion. Since it has already been done for other undead mobs by VI, there is no real argument that I have seen as to why Enchanters can't have the Spectre Illusion. <P>Absor states:<BR>&gt; Again, my personal opinion would have it so that only druids and shamans were to get nature-type transformations. I'm all for leaving that unique factor with them, and not giving it to enchanters. Again, that's my personal feeling on it.<P>Again this is one where the cat is already out of the bag, Wolf form, Tree..<P>Absor states:<BR>&gt; I'll see if I can get an official response for you on the reasons why. But don't discount the whole uniqueness thing, it's important.<P>What is it that enchanters have that is unique? We are not the only ones that can cast Illusions or transformations as you put it. Clarity? Bards have their mana song. Werewolf? that was unique, but is no longer.<P>Concerning the "Illusion" spell enchanters got in Vel.<BR>Absor states:<BR>&gt; Basically you're saying that you got a new illusion, but you don't like it…<P>Wait we get a target illusion spell that has a silly recast time. It is not a new Illusion, it is an existing illusion that can be  targeted, semantics but still..<BR>I would gladly trade that in for the ability to cast the other illusions and transformations. Don't tell me that this can't be done, it has been done in the past.<P>Absor states:<BR>&gt;Rather than 'throw you a bone' that at the same time reduces the uniqueness of the classes you mention, I'd rather see something that is actually unique.<P>So you agree that enchanters have nothing unique? And what do you think would be something that would make them unique when it comes to Illusions?<P>Absor states:<BR>&gt;While I understand, at least to a degree, the frustration that this might engender, the fact that those forms were given to those classes should not be the focus of our discussion. The focus should be on what should enchanters have in the way of illusions?<P>We should have Bear and Spectre, there is nothing you have yet to state other than "uniqueness" that makes sense and IMHO, your uniqueness arguement holds no water. Why should druids, Shamen and Necros be the only ones that are unique? And why should it be that a "Transformation" is what makes them unique? And if you feel they are not the only ones unique, give me an idea of what is unique about the other classes esp. Enchanters.<P>Overall Absor I appreciate you addressing this issue, but to be honest I see you only blowing smoke. Here is something that might be fun for Enchanters, let us illusion our pets. I don't really understand the idea behind giving Enchanters an animation for a pet. Might also be nice to change enchanter pets to some type of summoned mob, simular to the way Mages can summon different elementals.<BR>You want a list of Illusions that Enchanters could do? Heck there are a ton of Mobs in the game, lets do Grif, or Giant, Gnoll, or Orc. Heck a Wurm/Dragon illusion would rock. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Since VI will never take the time to read this far down in a post, this is directed towards All who play the enhanter class.<P>This unique factor for other classes is absurd.<P>We were enchanters, the masters of enchanting items and ourselves.  When the game started we were given, by those that created 'THE VISION', enchant metal spells for jewlry.  We were also promised, by those that created 'THE VISION', the abilities to enchant weapons and armor.  This was the basis of our class, to make us viable in combat, we were given, by those that created 'THE VISION', our mezz line and clarity.  This is 'THE VISION' of the creators of the game.<P>With Kunark 'THE VISION' was changed, now not quite so grand 'the VISION'.  We had found ways to make ourselves needed using the spells that we had been given&lt;mezz&gt;.  Why this apparently upset the new people, who had a new 'the VISION', I do not understand.  So they nerf.  Maybe they thought that their&lt;please read: abashi&gt; necro's&lt;please read: best soling character in the game&gt;  was being out cooled by the enhanter class.  I do not know their reasoning, but while others get very nice additions to their class, what do we get?  We get unmezzable creatures.  We also get renamed, we are now illusionists.  No longer can we claim to be the masters of enchantment as per 'THE VISION', we are now a small part of our original class.  We are now under the infulence of 'the VISION'.  I truely feel for those that designed the game originally, I know what it is to have your ideas and concepts changed, mutated, and torn apart.<P>Now we have Velious.  The &lt;hopefully&gt; final degradation of 'THE VISION', even less grand than 'the VISION', so here is 'the vision'.  In 'the vision', you enchanters are NOT enchanters, you illusionists are NOT illusionists.  Your abilities will be given out to others.  Many creatures will now be unable to be mezzed.  Your illusions will be only that, there will be no benefit given to them.  Your charms will still work "as intended" &lt;seconds of control&gt; so that mobs will agro so badly that it is near imposible to get them off you.  Your illusions will be given out to others, but we'll call them transformations&lt;hide in our symantics&gt; and give them special bonuses.  Welcome to 'the vision'.<P>Long live 'the vision'.<P>I'll be playing my enchantress, but with a different attitude.  No longer will I be reporting bugs&lt;and yes they are in there&gt;  I will use everything I know to give me an advantage with 'the vision'  I will patiently wait for a gm to be online while I am, in the hopes that I'll be banned.  And since there usually ARE NO GM's online, I'll just quietly leave as soon as the next online RPG comes out.  <P>Am I upset?  Yes, and you should be too.  Have they lied to us?  YES.  Will the game continue without me?  Yes, though I hope that when the enchanters start to slide off the face of Norath, they will remember 'the vision' and it's difference between 'THE VISION'<P>I hope to be banned before christmas.  'the vision' is no where near what was originally intended for EQ.  Yet they continue to cling to 'the vision' as their excuse to give away everything that was intended, from the begining, to go to enchanters.<P>Sorry for ranting, I'm off on my quest to get banned.  I'll bet that quest will be more succesful than alot of the still broken quests in 'the vision'. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm not going to stop bringing this up till i get an answer about Illusion: Evil Eye.  We all know it's in the global file already (Ahem, Eye of Zomm lets you summon a pet that looks like an evil eye in any zone).  We all know that no other class has anything remotely close to an Evil Eye illusion.<P>Absor posted~<BR>---------------------------<BR>Personally, I'd rather see a couple of new illusions that are cool. But I've mentioned this to the team, and I'm sure that we'll talk about it soon in a more in-depth way...Rather than 'throw you a bone' that at the same time reduces the uniqueness of the classes you mention, I'd rather see something that is actually unique...I'm all for more illusions at higher levels. My concern is that we don't give enchanters that while at the same time affecting the unique feel that other classes have gained...it does seem that there has been a lack of illusions for enchanters recently. That, by the way, is the whole point of discussion in this thread. <BR>---------------------------<P>C'mon, Where's my Illusion: Evil eye?  Is that unique and original and creative enough for you? I don't want any BS answer about the Global file or taking away uniqueness from another class. I want to know if we are gonna get Illusion: Evil Eye!  I'm not a good at thinking up illogical excuses as Absor is, but i'm still sure they will find some lame reason to not give us this spell.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First off, what do you Enchanters have that is unique? Umm, the elmental forms? (though I hear there is an item that does earth).  Spectre and wolf are both pets too so saying it isn't unique because an elemental is a mage pet doesnt wash.<P>You are no longer the masters of illusion?  You still get illusions for every PC race and can enter all their cities if agnostic (yes I don't like that requirement either). You get more illusions than other classes get transformations yet the lack of two images takes away your mastery?<P>Tell that to the Wizards, who are masters of DD, where *every* caster in the game gets DD, sometimes more powerful than the wizards.<P>Why do you get an animation?  You enchant a weapon to defend yourself.<P>Finally, take a good look at an Eye of Zomm sometime, and then take a good look at an evil eye.  I don't think you will find they are the same model.  I am not sure the zomm eye will look at all interesting if enlarged.<P>Mike</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Abosr:<BR>&gt;While I understand, at least to a degree, the frustration that this might engender, the fact that those forms were given to those classes should not be the focus of our discussion. The focus should be on what should enchanters have in the way of illusions?<P>I believe you are very wrong about this.  In fact I think this comment shows that, at least to some degree, you are missing the point of this thread.  <P>The discussion you are saying should be happening in this thread is the ongoing discussion that has been happening for enchanters ever since the first enchanter got past 44.  Enchanters have been looking at what illusions to add to their class and comming up with unique ideas for a long time.  The point of this thread is that our ideas were dismissed as not possible and then, when they were available, they were not given to enchanters even though we though of them and have been asking for them for a long time.  <P>Illusion Spectre inchanters have always wanted and always asked for, I can't count the number of threads I remember about enchanters getting this illusion.  Considering the reason for this one not being an illusion (no room in the global file) we came up with another unique idea that circumvented this: illusion target, or even illusion random mob, but this was given to mages.  The point I believe is that enchanters have been asking for and thinking up new unique ideas for illusions and VI does hear them, but they give them to other classes.<P>Other points related to what you have said:<P>1) Your opinion or no, enchanters already have undead illuions (skeleton and dry-bone skeleton) so that is not a valid argument for us not getting Spectre<P>2) Enchanters already have "nature" illusions (tree form and wolf form) so that is not a valid argument for us not getting bear illusion<P>3) Not all illusions give faction, which means there is a way to make illusions not give faction.  I seriously doubt that mage pets have the faction of the monster they assume, and if they do then this is grossly imbalancing.  One of the main drawbacks to pets is that you can't use them in a lot of dungeons, they will agro too many mobs and cause trains a lot of times.  If you just gave them the ability to have the faction of the creatures in the zone, there went that down side to pets.  For these reasons faction is not a valid reason for not giving enchanters new illusions (illusion targt or random mob in zone).<P>4) Enchanters are too cool already, already very effective, are better than x-class, are the (first, second, etc) best class in the game, etc. are not valid arguments because we are not asking for spells that would affect game play in any way.  <P>5) I would like to see these ideas:  Gender Illusion, Armor Illusion, Giant/Growth Illusion (not from the giant model merely an increase in the ratio of the character model.) Shrink Illusion (not unbalancing because we can already illusion to a smaller race to fit anywhere, just this way you keep your race.)  I think all of these should be stackable (if possible) with current illusions, and some with each other.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Nothing we can do here will make him change his mind. <P>He basicly said that be happy with what we got because he feels that we already have too much (like undead illusions and nature illusions).<P>So what if other classes can get the stuff that enchanters have wanted for so long. So what if a lot of the mobs in velious are unmezzable. So what if other classes have better lines of mez, slowing, and mana regen. We always have that great thing we are known for.

</FONT><HR>i have sat here today and read through every single post in this thread, and like most of the chanters here i find myself very disheartened. Whislt i realise that absor is in a difficult position in answering our rants and raves i feel he is doing the best he can, but like alot of you i feel also that he is missing the point.<P>Since i started eq some time ago chanters where known as masters of illusion and crowd control, now my definition of the word master is someone that can do a certain skill better than some else. therefore i think it very wrong for VI to give spectres bears and wolf illusions (YES illusions, the point being they LOOK like these creatures is our point, i dont think we are bothered about the effects and stats that come with them) to other classes because they are not illusionists. We already have to suffer a necro and a bard being able to boost mana, a necro being able to mez a bard charming, a druid charming, it doesn't matter a great deal to us, but with the addition of our illusions being given away aswell makes us feel seriously ununique as other classes now have alot of our main skills. So what if a necro mez doesn't last long, the fact is it is still a mez, at higher levels the bards manasong is faster than clarity. <P>I am not whinning and saying please dont give other people these spells, my point is that for us to remain master of illusions we must at LEAST be able to have these illusion spells with no stats/faction involved, after all we were told that we couldnt have a spectre illusion because of the lag caused, but now not only do you let a necro have a spectre pet but he himself can be one too, so because its for a necro the lag no longer matters? is that right? the whole lag story sounds like a lie to me<P>Tell me now how a chanter is unique?<P>And Absor humour me here....but let me guess...you play a necro...right?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I remember back when i played a warrior.. he was 35 at the time when i was running around CT. Well, one day I spotted something i'd never seen before..  An Enchanter in Werewolf form.. <P>It was that same day I created my Enchanter out of pure NEED.. I NEEDED to be able to do that!<BR>Since then my Enchanter character has slowly but surely crept up the lvl ladder and now sits proudly at 45.  My Warrior you ask?  Still 35.<P>When I made my Enchanter I knew very little about <BR>their spells or what they did besides the usual Mesmerize and i wasnt all that great with that either.. All I wanted to do was be a Werewolf!   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Bad news is i've been 45 for about 3 months.. <P>Just lost the drive that the werewolf spell has kept me striving for for so long  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>I think it's hardly asking a lot to give us a few new illusions.. after all it's the soul of our character. It's hard to imagine why we didnt get any new illusions with Velious since it's only like the ONLY thing we want and because it's so "Class Balance Issue" bonine.<P>BTW I've already heard that lameass excuse about faction problems if we got a "target mob type illusion".  What is this garbage? You telling me there's not one programmer that cant figure out how to NOT add faction to a spell?   <P>You guys need to either give us the straight facts or take a few classes on the art of Lying cause you guys are bad at it.<P>You can keep about Half the new 50+ spells and just give us a few "JUST FOR FUN" Illusion spells.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>i hear you LOUD and clear Killeus-rathe. thats exactly how i started my enchanter too. a man by the name of Kelton was running around in Werewolf form. he was nice enough to answer my very excitable questions and i knew from that day on i was destend to be an enchanter. i have FINALLY reached 49. but the only thing now &lt;because it certanly isnt spells exp or item&gt; is my ability to be a good enchanter. i know im good despite what anyone may say. but I LIVE FOR DUELS. wich is why i was ticked at the Best of the best and Test of tactics. thoes battles just  glorify anyone big enough to actually enter. <BR>but Illusions are a HUGE part of dueling for me. dueling also helps you TREMENDIOUSLY in the game.. if you dont think so. you need to rethink your skills  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am ready to give up my Enchanter.<BR>I was not aware of any of the new spells until I logged in recently and saw a mage with a werewolf as a pet then a sand giant. Now I find out Necro's get specter? This is B.S.  I guess pretty soon all classes will have some form of eveyone else's spells. It is called trying to make everyone happy and it truly takes away from the game.I remember I could not wait till 44 to get werewolf, It meant something. Now illusions mean nothing. what a joke. So can I have sow with wolf form? or a pet as good as a Necro's now? Clarity is pretty much going out the door... why is everyone gettin Mana Enhancement spells and Illusions... ? Why would any other class get them? Can I get sow? can I teleport? Can I get more HP's? do I want them? No. I only want the spells for the class I started and enhancements to them. Oh..but those belong to Necro's and Mage's now.. I don't know who's brain child that was. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Firstly, thankyou Absor for paying attention to this thread, even though you have not yet finalised any answers for us.<P>Secondly, I still play a chanter as my main and love it. The only complaint I have in my day-to-day playing is that with over 140 spells at lvl 43, and at least 20 useful at any time, 8 slots forces me to think too much! But no, I don't want any more spell gems, I like a bit of tactics.<P>I have stopped reading every response on this thread, as it really did get a bit much after the first 500 or so.<P>I can not continue to say "The main point of the thread is..." as there are too many opinions here to pretend we are speaking with a unified voice. But I have more input.<P>1. Absor mentioned that the factions tied to a form are tied to it _in the global file_ so we can't get any different faction without significant effort on existing global models like bear or spectre or eye of zomm. This is useful information.<P>2. Absor mentioned that his opinion is just that, and has stated no Company Policy (or Vision) regarding the issue of additional illusions, be they undead or otherwise. Okay, thanks for taking it to the rest of the team.<P>3. I don't think this would have become such an issue if we hadn't had our title given as Illusionist. Sure, VI reserve the right to change their ideas for progression of a class, and just cos we have new illusions every spell circle to 44 doesn't mean they think we should ever get more. Until we are named after that ability at 55, which leads us to believe this is considered a core ability.<P>4. I would like an answer to how this came about!<P>Enchanter community: Can we have a new illusion?<BR>Verant: Maybe, we'll see. No new models in global file though.<BR>Enc: Spectre would be cool.<BR>VI: No room in global file.<BR>Enc: okay, i guess. *sniff*<BR>VI: Oh, we have room in global file for a new race.<BR>Enc: Cool! Illusion: Iksar?<BR>VI: Sure, but it doesn't make you safe in cabilis without big faction work.<BR>Enc: okay, i guess.<BR>VI: Oh, we found room in global file for a new pet, spectres.<BR>Enc: Cool! Illusion: Spectre?<BR>VI: No, too many polygons.<BR>Enc:  okay, i guess. *sniff*<BR>VI: Actually, not too many polys, necros can have spectre form with Lich.<BR>Enc: Cool! Illusion: Spectre?<BR>VI: No, we don't think you should have it.<BR>Enc: You tell us this now? This is very vexing.<P><BR>it looks like this could be taken as:<BR>Enc: New toy?<BR>VI: No, tech issue 1.<BR>VI: tech issue 1 resolved. toy implemented as pet.<BR>Enc: New toy?<BR>VI: No, tech issue 2.<BR>VI: tech issue 2 resolved. toy implemented for other class.<BR>Enc: new toy?<BR>VI: No, you don't deserve it.<BR>Enc: eek! 800 post thread on forums complaining, and querying, and getting sidetracked.<P>5. You may think this was a poor design decision, but the fact remains that prior to Velious, Enchanters had access to every form other classes did - either pet or illusion or transformation. This was PART OF OUR UNIQUENESS! Yep, skeleton, drybone, spirit wolf, tree, all races, elementals, and a bonus of werewolf! (this one's unique, it's a mob, but that's okay, nobody likes it. it's a toy.) Maybe a bad call, but that's what we grew up with. It's our environmental conditioning! <P>Now, suddenly, not only does someone else get what we have asked for, not only do we not get higher-level illusions, we are told that our own preconceptions are wrong. That maybe we should never have had access to these. That we won't be getting to look like the new pets (monsters) or like the new pets (bears) or like the new pets (spectres) or like the new illusions (spectres) or like the new transformations (bears). And you quote this as being sacred because it's a unique thing for the other classes. It seems to me that this reasoning is flawed, because it is taking away some of our own uniqueness.<P>So yes, class envy rears its ugly head, and we start saying "We want it too!" or maybe even "We want it instead!" <P>I apologise for my own class-envy additions. I blame social conditioning, and false expectations formed by looking forward to being named an illusionist, and maybe even to earning that title.<P>If we are told "No, you won't get any further illusions," I think that this may be accepted as dogma. Bad dogma, but there it is. Equivocal responses seem to have allowed us to form our own expectations, however.<P>Thanks for your time, and for your responses, to Absor, the enchanters out there, and everyone else who is paying attention.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, this may be kind of harsh, but I feel I need to say it...<P>First, enchanter=enchant, not enchanter=illusionist.  Accept what they give you and play the game.  It is only a game and it's what you make of it.<P>Second, what idiots out there think brow beating Absor is going to get you what you want?  This is real life people and not the game.  You can't charm them or mez them, all you can do is talk to them in a rational manner and hope for the best.  Because I can tell you now, it's their game.  We pay to play it.  They OWN the game and they can run it any way they damn well please.  So try being kind to them and see if that works before spouting that you KNOW the way this game should run and telling them to make it the way you want or you'll quit.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, heres some suggestions on what I think may be some of the more "powerfull" Illusions:<P>**Mirror Image (like the AD&D spell)<P>**Sanctuary (Area of effect spell to turn a group into something like a bunch of bushes or rocks for safety)<P>**Shadow Form (in line with our AC buff, a sorts of shadowy wispy form)<P>**Cast Illusions on others!! (thats a biggie!!)<P>**ANY Group Illusion of exsisting form<P>**Wings - a sorts of Levitate but maybye a faster movement and no dang bobbing effect<P>**Phantasmal Force - A horrific type of monster that flys out at the target and has a fear effect<P>**Illusionary Wall/Cage - This could be in line with the "Mezzing" ability of the Enchanter. A sorts of 'Stun' <P>Lastly at level 60 every  class seems to get some uber type of spell that is specific to thier class such as the Necro Spectre pet etc. Now I am assuming that the spell for us is "Dictate" a fixed charm, but with a useless durtion of 48 seconds, cost of 750 mana and a recast time of 5 mins!!! this spell is absolutly useless and worthless. So I was thinking the last and grande Illusion that we all can look forwad to, such as Dragon or Giant. Give us something to really look forward too.

</FONT><HR>Alan,<P>Originally, the Public Relations guy was supposed to act as a liason between us, the customer, and Verant.  Though with every logical debate that enchanters have presented, you end up shooting it down.  Now, please do not take this wrong because I am an advocate that everyone deserves their own opinion.  That is the entire basis of Freedom of Speech.  However, I think the feeling we enchanters are getting is that, with your opposing views, enchanters will never get any new illusions.  I can probably say for a majority of the enchanter community that this is the way we see it.  Picture you are trying to sell a new idea to your boss.  Your boss says that he does not like the idea too much but promises to present your idea before the Board of Directors.  Your boss goes before the Board and says "Well, this is the idea Johnson came up with, but I think it is a bad idea."  Just what do you think the Board will do.  Probably dismiss the idea without much thought.  That is the feeling I get from you.  I am sorry if you feel I am stereo-typing you or making unfounded assumptions, but this is the conotation I get from the tone of your posts.  Please try to be a bit more un-biased and objective in your responses and views.  If you have never played an Enchanter then there is no way you can understand what the class is or what it is about.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Since it has already been done for other undead mobs by VI, there is no real argument that I have seen as to why Enchanters can't have the Spectre Illusion. *****<P>YES THIS IS AN ARGUMENT!<P>I believe it was a MISTAKE.

</FONT><HR>Wow, what a tempest in a teapot!  Absor, I congratulate you on keeping a very reasonable tone despite some heated diatribes on what is actually a pretty minor part about being an Enchanter (IMHO), and yes, I do play an Enchanter.  The main things my Enchanter brings to the group are Crowd Control and Buffs.  We are one of the best classes in the game.  Illusions are fun and useful at times, but not a huge deal.  The Illusion I use the most is Illusion:Gnome so I can get around better in tight dungeons.<P>I would be fine with dropping our Undead and Animal Illusions and making those the sole province of Necro's, Shammies and Druids.  I think the reason that we originally got them was that the Programmers wanted to give us as many Illusions as possible so they basically just gave us everything in the Global File.<P>To the guys trying to argue that there is no distiction between Illusions and Transformations, please shut up.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  The logical outcome of that arguement is that our Illusions would lose their added effects.<P>But anyway, here are a few ideas for some new Illusions.  They may have been suggested before or they may not be practical from a proggramming point of view, but tell me what you think.<P>Illusion:Face -- checks your race and sex and randomly picks a new face from the Global file for that Race and sex.  No stat mods.<P>Illusion:Chain -- makes us look like we are wearing chainmail.  May give some AC if you want.  The Magician spell Phantom Armor should do this too.<P>Illusion: Plate -- same except that it is Plate.<P>I also think you should consider adding a few illusions to the Global file.  Evil Eyes would be a good one and they are often Enchanters.<P>Finally, and what I think would be the best way to go is to allow Enchanters to start casting their Illusions on other targets at upper levels.  The Werewolf illusion is a good start on this.  I think this would be useful without being overpowering and wouldn't need any additions to the Global file.

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I agree that Necromancers should be able to look like various members of the undead world.  I also agree with the new spells that Mages get.<P>I think the main disappointment everyone has here is the lack of new illusion spells, the reason we were given for not receiving any, and *then* seeing that other spell casters were given spells that seemed to take away from our class uniqueness.<P>I believe I understand the issues and reasons you have given behind this, and the possible difficulties that will be raised if enchanters can make themselves appear as any type of creature in a zone.  Here's an idea though, add illusion spells for some unique type of monsters, ones that wouldn't allow you to go anywhere special.  I would love to be able to walk around sometimes as a giant, or fly like a griffon, or swim the seas like a shark or sea serpent.<P>Basically the spells could be groupped along various levels (Type I, Type II).  These would then allow you to select a specific type of creature (or randomize it) that would still be KOS to the guardians of the zone (much like I am KOS when in elemental form, but not when in some other form).<P>Even if not, just add a few illusions (like the Giant/Griffon/Shark) and I'll be happy.  As for the Illusion-Gender spell, don't bother unless I can cast it on others. :-)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
