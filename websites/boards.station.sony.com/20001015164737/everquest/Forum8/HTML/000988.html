&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>While I had been doing a little yard work (A mindless task, let me tell you), a few questions and ideas sprang into my imaginative mind.  Ever since the new tradeskill patch came in, I was dreaming of being able to make items that matched those found on high level MOBs.  After a few looksies, I was a little disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, it's great stuff, and I'd bet that a level 1-30 would more than likely want to wear that armor (maybe even higher!), but... at the peak of leveling, all of the best stuff is found off Dragons, Demi-Gods, or very rare spawns.  That in it's own way is romantic ("I had to defeat the biggest Dragon in the WOLRD to get this!"), but making something with YOUR OWN HANDS just seems to be the pinnacle of greatness.<BR>  <BR> As I said before, don't get me wrong, it's great stuff!  But I'd doubt that a level 57 warrior would be wielding a Northman Mace.  But, what if... You could MAKE something as good as, let's say... The Wurmslayer?  Ghoulbane?  Or another higher level item?  "Wouldn't that just be swell?"<P>   Here's my  idea in action: A level 47 Troll Shadow Knight likes the items out there, but wants to make a 2-handed sword for himself, but doesn't see any he likes.  He's been an avid Smithy, and has a skill level of 213.  After fighting Frogloks in Guk, he kills a new spawn named "Froglok Master Smith" who happens to have a No-Drop "Guide of the DarkAvenger" book.  After reading it (and a great story of the Dark Smithy and how he conquered the powerful forces of good) he finds a recipe of sorts... for: The DarkAvenger!!!  He needs: some ShadowTemper, a shadowed forging hammer, one ball of crystallized death, 2 bars of Banished Black Ore, one Blackened Dusty Mold, one Death's Eye (jewel), and one mysterious item (a Paladin's blood spilt upon the ground of the unforgiven).<BR> <BR>  Now, using this example, we can make an incredible item, holding everything true to "The Vision" (that is assuming I know any of "The Vision", which I really don't.  So, I guess I'm just guessing what "The Vision" is).  The Shadow Temper can be acquired with a relative amount of ease... I'm not going to go into detail.  This item already exists.  The shadowed forging hammer (I'm fairly sure this doesn't exist) would be on a Shadowed Man.  It could be on a named one, or it could be a common drop on most shadowed men.  The ball of crystallized death would be on a spectre named "Lord Muertos" in Oasis.  This item would be No-Drop, Magic, Lore.  A good portion of these items I feel would and should be made No-Drop.  This would prevent many people camping a relatively rare spawn just for profit and (I feel) extortion.  Next would be the 2 bars of Banished Black Ore.  This would be a rare drop on common spawns (i.e. something like Frogloks in Guk, anyone Froglok, would have a 1 in 100 chance of dropping the ore).  This would be Magic, but not No-Drop.  Since this item is pretty much not campable, it would profit people to sell it.  This way, a lazy person could buy the ore, while a penny pincher could obtain the ore.  And both of these are just as achievable.  The Blackened Dusty Mold would be found on a named MOB in a high level dungeon.  Maybe an "Undead Dragon" in Veeshan's Peak or a "Fallen Paladin" in Unrest.  This would be a relatively rare spawn, but I'd make it common drop.  This would be Magic, No-Drop, and Lore.  The Death's Eye cold be found in two ways: 1) found upon a powerful or rare spawn (such as Cazic Thule for the powerful and Pyzjn for the rare) or 2) obtained through a mini-quest.  The mini-quest could be semi simple, like having an NPC Rogue have the gem, but want 12 Expensive items.  These items could be obtained by giving a new NPC such as "A Rude Individual" 10pp (100 gold if you want to keep NPCs using gold) and they would hand you an "Expensive Bracelet."  Another of the same named NPC could give an "Expensive Amulet" or an "Expensive Belt."  This would be simple in idea, but would aggravate players to no end (especially me) by trying to find EVERY "A Rude Individual."  I know this is just the kind of thing that Verant would make us do... AND they'd enjoy every minute of it (RivenClaw lets you know that he was JUST KIDDING!).  Finally the last mysterious item could actually be very simple (despite how it sounds).  You could hail common people walking by, and they'd comment upon "Poor old Wizenbred and Booterkin."  It would seem that Wizenbred was killed by an evil Shadow Knight and little Booterkin (A Paladin) tried to come and avenge his old friend.  Booterkin being an inexperienced whelp met his fate in Lesser Fay when he met that very same Shadow Knight.  It seems that all there is now is a wilted flower on the hill where he died.  All you'd have to do is go to the hill and pick up the "A Wilted Flower."  Having all the items, our good ol' troll comes upon a special forge deep within a dungeon (I heard there were a few already...) and he prepares to create the DarkAvenger.  He takes a deep breath and...  He failed! But wait... No!  It was just lag!  He now has the DarkAvenger!  A 2-Handed sword that is 36/45 Magic, Lore, No-Drop, SK only.  It's stats increase are: 10+ STR, 10+ STA, 5+ DEX, 5+ AGL, 20- INT, 10- WIS.  And there you have it. <BR> A complete guide to a well made sword!<BR>  <BR> I just made up numbers and names in this, and (of course) these things could be changed by Verant.  But the idea of making an exquisite item yourself is quite nice.  Think about it! "woooo... kewl sord dewd!"  "Aye!  Me make dis' all by me self!  Me am GOD next to punny creature like you."  Yeah... Definitely the pinnacle of EQ Evolution in my mind.<BR>  <BR>Plus, this follows the roots of AD&D (for those of you who just really want to stick close to the "Original").  It seems that it takes the same amount of difficulty making a +5 Long Sword as finding one!  And, another thing I forgot to mention, is that there is even MORE risk involved in making it.  Not only do you have to be an adequate skill in smithing, but even if you do, there IS a chance of failure.  Now that would break the heart...  But, it's the matter of risk vs. reward.<BR> <BR>  Personally, I'd love to hear other's players responses on this but also (more importantly) A Verant employee!  I'd feel honored if someone like that came down from their lofty position as "Creators" and decided to converse with the, at times, lowly common player, the "1 in 20,000."  (Sorry, I just like romanticizing being the 1 in 20,000).  I hope this idea spawns a new beginning (if you hadn't already planned something like this, which I know you did, right?)  <P>However, I don't want this to be just for smithing.  I would love to see caster's be able to make a nice robe through tailoring or a good staff.  It's just the idea the counts.<P>Thanks for listening to my lengthy post!<P>~RivenClaw</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I Don't like "No Drop" in this situation.<BR> I don't see the pinnacle as making it yourself, after all, what should a big burly warrior type know about making stuff?  I like the idea of getting the stuff together, heading off to your local (trusted) smith, and having him forge it for you, (maybe protecting him as he goes to the magical forge/forges it) presenting you with the finished item, then paying him some huge amount for a job well done.  (*grin*)<P>  To that end, I would like to see the following implemented, either 1:  Not No Drop, and success/fail message "sayed" listing parts used for trade skill combines.<BR>  or 2:  (and I like this one better, actually), and you can do the whole No Drop thing in this one.  Once a trade window is open, a tradesperson can open up his "tool of the trade" and the open container will ALSO appear on the GUI of the other person.  The other person can then drop items directly into the "kit" (including No Drop items), as well as any items/money onto his side of the trade window.  When the "trade" is acceptable to both, the crafsmen hits "combine" and the buyer hits "trade".  If the skill check is successful, the buyer get's his brand new item, and the craftsmen gets all the stuff in the trade.  Otherwise, the parts are lost, (except any that survive) and all the stuff returns to owner.  (If either hit cancel, all stuff returns too.  Like trading, you can't remove.  (NOTE:  if trade container starts with stuff in it, it is treated like normal container, until it's opened while empty.)  Also, possible either generic skill "title" or actual number value should be shown.  (NOTE:  title would only really work if Verant decides to put in a few more titles above master.)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well, I like that idea about the trading/combining.  It almost makes me want to change the No-Drop situation.  But still, this would just be like the Fiery Avenger quest, as in that ONLY the smith can make it AND aquire the items necessary.  Whether or not the Finished Product (in this case, the DarkAvenger) would be No-Drop would be up to Verant.  Personally, I like the idea of being able to sell an extremely good hand-made item, so I honorably withdraw my past comment on making the Finished Product No-Drop.<P>~RivenClaw</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum8&number=8&thisthread=000988&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum8&number=8&thisthread=000988&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
