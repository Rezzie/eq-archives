</FONT><HR>Ok, please excuse me, but I skipped a few pages of this thread as it seems to have denigrated into a name calling contest...and who has time for that nonsense. <P>So, to address Drakezius and his original post:<P>Dude, I think many of us, especially after spending a year or two in-game start wondering if the time has been well spent.  EQ is brilliant about providing a doorway to escapism.  <P>Escapism is a double-edged sword.  Either you can handle real life as it happens, or you choose to avoid it and wait until you feel better equipped...as it were.  If you select EQ as your method of avoidance, and you never find time to deal with RL, well, then EQ will seem addictive.  (And quitting anything addictive is always difficult.)<P>I have seen friends become "addicted" to EQ to the point that they have very little contact with the real world anymore.  I believe these people would have become "addicted" to anything that allowed them to escape the absolute horror that was their real life.  <P>By the same token, I have plenty of friends who play EQ on the weekends.  It doesn't interfere with their jobs, their dogs get walked, their house is not crawling with unidentified bacteria and the fridge doesn't attack.  <P>Ergo, EQ, like anything else, is what you make of it.  If you find yourself avoiding your real life in favor of your virtual life, then perhaps it's time to evaluate what in real life makes you unhappy or uncomfortable.  <P>To address point 3, where you say that you are getting nowhere in game...at the risk of being too Jungian for the board...perhaps what you are really unhappy about is that you see no progress in any other aspect of your reality and you are transferring those feelings onto an easy target.... sprites on a screen.  <P>I say none of this as a flame or as an attack.  But, I believe that if you feel thusly, perhaps it’s time to explore those parts of your reality which you feel to be neglected…i.e., friends and family.  In other words, you may have had an epiphany which truly speaks to your situation.  If so, you owe it to yourself to follow that path.  <P>EQ, or it’s equivalent will be here.  You can always go back, you don’t always see a clear path ahead.  <P><BR>Oh, and to Bloodsage; what in the heck does "GQLLFM" stand for?  Sorry to be the official idiot, but everything I came up with was either nonsensical or obscene.  (Of course, I spend most of my life either nonsensical or obscene…so it’s not too much of a surprise really.)  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It'll be interesting to see if this gets split, and perhaps has a chance at reincarnation to a higher existence.<P>Straithlin,<P>Interesting that you simply pull my point out of context, and blithely ignore the fact that Verant _has_ stated their position.<P>Oh, wait.  You're now demanding to know _why_ the policies are the way they are.<P>Who cares?  Why do you think you deserve a personal explanation?<P>Get over yourself, already.  Your measly little monthly fee doesn't entitle you to demand answers at every turn, or demand things change to meet your personal satisfaction.  Either play by the rules as they exist, or go elsewhere.<P>Pretty simple, if you'd think about it.<P>The fact that this thread is not locked or deleted, when so many others around it have been, ought to be answer enough to your silly question.  What more do you want?  A personal telegram from the CEO of Sony telling you to defend your ideas, if you have any?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

So your hypocricy, mixed so thoroughly with disingenuous posturing, is by far the slimier of the two, even if one accepts your premise.<P>Since your only point is to say you don't like my style, what makes you think I care?

</FONT><HR>Bye BS<P>I hope your future posts can be a little less confrontational, just for the well being of this message board. There was a post that said they just might get rid of the whole thing because of the state of mind that has come about because of it.<P>While most of your posts I have observed you are defending Verant (why they need defending is beyond me) there is a better way to get your point across. Lighten up a little.<P>And while I was in the military myself. I was not and officer. Although I was a M.P. and many times ran into officers that thought that because of their rank they deserved to be treated better then your average everyday soldier.<P>While I haven't come to a conclusion if you fir in this category. It is very obvious that if indeed I would have had any run ins with you while in that position. Being it for speeding/not obeying a traffic control device, or anything. It seems quite obvious there would have been a problem between us. <P>You need to look in the mirror and stop pointing fingers at everyone else's behavior. While others (including myself) are not perfect, and sometimes will come across to you as being inferior, or whiny. This does not give you the right to question anyones intelligence or character.<P>Like I said before, there are alot better ways to get your point across. Weather or not you choose to use those other methods are up to you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Dominate,<P>Bye, and good luck to you.<P>Please don't presume to know me or predict how you think I am in RL: you are guaranteed to be wrong, and the only outcome is more of that confrontation thing you don't like.<P>There are as many MPs with bad attitudes as their are officers, as I'm sure you know.  So your point is a bit lost, there, sorry.<P>I'm as polite as I feel the situation warrants, and, frankly, this situation didn't seem to warrant anything resembling kid gloves and tea cups.<P>While I appreciate your observations, I think I'll continue on my merry way, with due consideration that some may not like it.  That's okay, though, I'm not here to be popular.  But there are as many who popped in voicing support as there were drive-through bashings, so I find it hard to feel to bad.<P>Perhaps this will be split, and receive a new lease on life.  Too bad dejahblue's excellent post is buried in this tripe, though; it deserves better.<P>Good luck killing the beasties: fair wind and following seas, as the squids say.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

You can call it hypocritical if you want, and to some limited extent you are correct.  I think the person who landed the first 37 blows has a far bigger problem, though.<P>Other than the first sentence of your first four posts (which, left alone, would have been an interesting starting point, but which you regrettably followed with a pointless insult), your first four posts contained no content of any sort.  They were exercises in belittling other people for your own entertainment.  Other people did not make you the subject of this thread, you made yourself the subject of this thread.<P>When you condescendingly chide other people for not discussing content once every five (of 37) threads, you are playing a manipulative game.  One where you define the rules on the fly, and everyone else loses.  That's a common attribute shared by bullies and abusers, and while you may be neither, it is worth some reflection.<P>Here's a challenge for you:<P>Respond to my post with a straightforward statement of your own position on the first poster's comments, without referring to any of us on this post in any way.  Discuss the "content".  I sincerely doubt you can do it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Dominate:<P>Go play your game somewhere else.  Or try to score fairly: I'm under no obligation to sit still for this silliness.<P>Kenross:<P>Do you have reading comprehension problems?  You seem unable to understand any of what you've read, at any rate.<P>I don't really care that you think GQLLFM is an unwarranted insult.  It isn't.<P>You seem conveniently to characterize this thread as me ganging up on everyone else, which is nothing short of bizarre.  As if I spent 37 posts on the offense, against poor, defenseless people trying to have a conversation.  That's ludicrous.<P>I simply challenged--I don't really care if you approve of the method--a confrontational comment in the original post.  And was roundly attacked for it, it quite personal terms. . .followed by a series of others, such as yourself, who feel free to add their own poorly reasoned psychoanalyses to the glut already present here.  I chose to respond--as you say is okay, given your far-fetched and melodramatic analogy.<P>The bottom line is that if Drakezius was unable to defend himself except through blatant flames and name calling, he shouldn't have chosen to be confrontational in his opening gambit.  He proved everything I said every time he responded.  As have so many others, yourself included.<P>I addressed the cencepts in the original post.  Go back and read the thread if you weren't able to catch it on your first time through.<P>You still seem unable to make subtle logical distinctions, as I've tried to point out to you.  Perhaps your holier-than-thou arrogance has blinded what faculties you possess.  Or perhaps, as you imply early on, you are simply offended at your perception of who you think I am, and the facts or situation matter little beyond the opportunity to get your digs in.<P>Feel free.<P>But at least attepmt a little honesty.  Your tortured self-justification is nothing short of dizzying.  Simply admit that, like the others, you've come here to bash me.  Don't try to claim you're sticking up for the helpless (a veiled insult to everyone else in the thread), or that you're accomplishing a greater good.<P>That's just pathetic.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I have gotten two years of great enjoyment from the game but it is going to be time to move on very soon.  Generally, when I tire of an entertainment vehicle, I move on to another (shocking, eh). No blaming the company for my boredom.  No incesent whining on a company sponsored Gameplay Board about my selfish desires to make the game more to MY liking.  I just leave.  When I went to see the movie "Major League", I left in the middle.  Why?  Because it sucked.  IF you think EQ sucks, what should you do?  Why leave of course. You would think any bright 12 year old could figure that out.<P>Keep up the good work Blood.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cool.gif">   <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Verant doesn't cause your feelings, _you_ do. If you're no longer having fun, the reasonable thing to do is to take your bi-weekly McDonald's Quarter Pounder Value Meal's worth of fee and go do something you do enjoy. Not to whine and cry and moan that Verant is somehow at fault for not building a game that meets your personal specifications.<P>It's their world, their vision, and their game. By any reasonable metric, they are wildly successful. Be glad you've been invited to participate in this historic endeavor, and leave quietly when you're no longer having fun. If you feel strongly that you have suggestions how to improve the experience for those who follow you, then send them a letter explaining ways to improve.<P>Wow looks like you have bitten your own tongue riht off doesn't it?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Thanks, Chanter.<P>I've been kind of bored with it myself, lately.  I'm considering starting a new character on one of the PvP Teams servers to see if that adds spice.  My schedule dictates a mostly solo career, though, so it'll just be the added element of danger and the occasional pickup raid into enemy territory, though.<P>BTW, I just got Clive Barker's Undying, and it's awesome.  Outstanding voice acting and a really creepy atmosphere make it very immersive.  If you like FPS games with a plot, I highly recommend it.  But don't play at night!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sorry, Dominate, but I'm missing your point.<P>Are you saying that my nonsense post making fun of all the usual after-patch whines is somehow related to, and somehow contradicts, my feelings that EQ is a historic game and people should either play, or leave, but not blame Verant for their self-imposed lack of fulfillment?<P>Or did you think the first thing you quoted was serious?  That simply proves you didn't read the thread.<P>I really do want to understand, but I can't make the connection.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064058-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064058.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064058-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064058-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064058-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064058-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064058-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=064058&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=064058&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
