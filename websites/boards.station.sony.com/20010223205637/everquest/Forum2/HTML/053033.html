</FONT><HR>Alright, since we're all revving up the nerf machine, mebbie they need to take a look at the Jaundiced Bone Bracer. 250+ mana for free, every 7 seconds or so. I dueled a shaman who had one last night, he expended all his mana, then hit me with those over and over and over for no mana. No class should have a class defining item? Head over to http://forums.eqforge.com/shaman . They're pulling a Ranger and keeping quiet so they can be overpowered *ahem* Trueshot *ahem*. <P>I know I'm going to get flamed, but you get flamed no matter what anyhow, so let it rip!<P><BR>Dethek Casts<BR>RZ</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Woo hoo, the Cleric backlash has begun.<P>Anyway, Verant know about the Bracer and do not believe that 263 damage for approximately 120 mana is anything untowards.<P>In fact that ratio of mana cost to damage is perfectly in line with the rest of the game.<P>Anyway.  Glad they finally nerfed the abysmal BP of Overpowerment.  Fingers crossed they fix Complete Heal next.  If they have *any* sense they'll divide the Death Penalty by ten and remove XP Ressurection.  Maybe they don't have the guts to go that far, but CHeal is an acceptable target and now Verant ADMIT that it is a broken spell, hopefully it will be removed.<P>Nice end to your pathetic free lunch that would be, Cleric.<P>Regards,<BR>Eduin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yes<BR>Nerf the Shaman Jaundice Bone Helmet too. Its completely imbalancing the game when those damn Shaman can cast a lvl 30+ charisma buff on themselves without using mana. Then they go to the bank with NO downtime and sell fine steel and rocks and get up to a Plat or 2 more than me. This item is too UBER and must be nerfed. <P>Might need to look at the Shaman Breastplate too. It is SOOooooo L33t it's scary. That dmg shield is just incredible and all class defining for the Shaman. They get all this and Alchemy, which is the most awsome skill in the game.

</FONT><HR>I usually would use tact in this situation, but shamans have been so anti-cleric, thinking we shouldn't be the best at healing, and needed at all, that I had to ....reallocate some of the love. <P>Shamans say, and you can head to their site and read a few posts, that we shouldn't have CH...and that they should have all their nukes, buffs, slows, speeds and still be able to heal the same as us, just only a circle or two below us. So they want we clerics, to be watered down to where we're completely useless in any situation. I take it all in stride, and when they rejoice in a nerfing of the cleric class, I rejoice in taking the opportunity to nerf theirs. I didn't throw the first stone. <P>Now that the hybrid exp penalty is gone, and they're getting all the upgraded healing spells, along with their nukes, buffs, TPs and everything, the healing-hybrids are (perhaps unaware that they're doing it) trying to be the second best at everything. Making those of us who had to sweat through getting our levels, without diversity, regret our decisions to become pure classes. <P>Nerf me, Nerf you. It happens. Mock me, and I'll open your eyes to what you neglect to see. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>wow. Emotional handicaps. Genius. <P>I'm all for upgrading some of the healing for shamans and druids. But not to where you can fizzle-less superior heal at level 44 like some shaman suggest. Mebbie you should read more than one post, and some of the ones on here?<P>Bottom line is cleric lack diversity. One thing that we DID do well, is heal. Now, the exp-unhindered, uber-diversity-classes, like shaman and druids want to heal CLOSE to par with us. SH at 44? <P>An upper level raid group should have a cleric, a tank and the rest should follow. Which would you want in your group? A cleric who can heal and buff, or a shaman who can heal nearly as well, buff, DoT, Nuke, Slow, cast speed buffs, cripple, cannablize, chloro? I know if Shamans had SH at 44, I know who I'd pick. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The majority of people who play Clerics are incredibly selfish and greedy individuals.  They *love* the fact they are required and no-one else can heal.  In fact for most of them, its why they choose a Cleric - no-one would group with their main but they *must* have a Cleric and even a sociopath playing a Cleric is better than no Cleric at all.<P>You fear that Verant might on day understand that *all* healing classes must be able to heal.

</FONT><HR>Whoever said clerics shouldn't have CH is completely insane. I am a Shaman. I do not want to be a Cleric. I do, however, function as a healer more often than not. Even at my current level, 41, I'm starting to notice that I cannot heal enough to keep my sword swinging friends on their feet. I liked the idea of perhaps adjusting the fizzle rate on my highest heal. I also liked the idea of a spell similar to the new Celestial spells that Clerics get. <P>I do not however want CH. CH is NOT my job, but I can already see how bad the situation is going to get for me. And the people who depend on me. <P>Calling for nerfs of any type is just plain sad. I don't care what a Cleric and a Warrior do with or without their armor. Go solo Trak for all I care. <BR>I don't care if a Shaman uses his bracer in every single fight from the time he gets it until he hits 60. I don't have on yet. I may never have one. Using either of these items, as they were intended to be used, doesn't affect my playing at all.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Which would you want in your group? A cleric who can heal and    buff, or a shaman who can heal nearly as well, buff, DoT, Nuke, Slow, cast speed buffs, cripple, cannablize, chloro? I know if Shamans had SH at   44, I know who I'd pick.&gt;&gt;<P>You'd pick a cleric.  Because if a shaman is the group healer, he's not doing all those other things you mentioned.  Maybe one or two, but certainly not all.  <P>I don't know that the JBB is broken, but without a doubt the breastplate does too much.  It *has* to be nerfed, and I think Verant is being pretty generous with what they are proposing.<P>The bottom line isn't cleric diversity, at least in this thread.  The bottom line is that an overpowered cleric item is being nerfed, so a few clerics have decided to expend their grief on any target available.  Shamans want to be viable healers in the end game (when no clerics are available), shamans have a good, if rare, item, shamans get targeted.<P>It is the very height of whining.<P>-TTm</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Right now I am so sick of the protectionistic whining of (specific) clerics, I wouldn't care terribly if they were deleted as a class.<P>*sigh*<P>I love clerics as a class, but we should not NEED them.  The way things stand now is ridiculous.  Clerics are indispensible.  We should be able to survive with a druid or shaman (not as easily, but we should be able to). <P>If one was to assign a point value to a clerics value soloing and their value to a normally balanced group, and compare those numbers to the numbers assigned to ANY other classes' totals for a similarly balanced group, you'd see HUGE disparities across the board.  <P>Sorry, but you should not NEED a cleric. <P>Following your logic, mages intrude on wizards because they can nuke well enough to be a (weak) substitute for a wizzie in a pinch.  The fact is that you SHOULD be replacable!  ALL classes SHOULD be replacable, and the fact that yours isn't, is a GROSS balance issue!  It's putrid and violates all CONCEPT of balance in this game!  <P>Is this inflammatory?  I HOPE SO!  LOOK AT WHAT YOU WRITE!  You're behaving like children, jealously keeping others out of the high level game so you can go where you want, when you want.<P>If it were even remotely viable, I'd suggest a boycott of clerics to protest this balderdash that Shams and Druids should not be able to be effective as the primary healer at high levels.

Thats a shade over 120 mana for this "free" damage.<P>All Shaman spells are *grossly* inflated in mana cost due to this skill.  Which is *utterly* pathetic when Necros have a *VASTLY SUPERIOR* method of HP to Mana which requires *no* work (Shamans have to repeatedly hit keys for up to 10 hours at a time).

Clerics have very little to be proud of except their ability to heal, and ressurection.  I have fun playing my cleric, I do a lot more than just sit and heal, but you take away CH and give Shaman and druids better heals and I'll never have a reason to play my cleric again, ever.  If you claim the game would be better if clerics weren't so powerful you are laughably ill informed on the abilities of clerics.  Healing and rez, thats it.  You take away healing and you will NEVER find a cleric to rez your stupid butt when you've died, they will cease to exist.  I know I'd never log mine on again, why should I when the Shaman would be nearly as good, and just as good with another shaman or druid along to help out.

I have one, so I know. There are so many items in the game that truly ARE imbalancing that it amazes me the JBB keeps getting picked on over things like say...oh quad-kiting, or virtually any of the extremely decent cleric items in game (and no I am not suggesting they take away from the cleric items...more power to em in fact as they are lucky to be one of the favored classes). The Shaman class usually gets nothing but BS from Verant in the form of nerf after nerf, or giving away of Shaman class defining spells to other classes. I'd say, leave the Shaman class alone in your calling for nerfs, or better yet take a deeper look at your OWN class as it is likely to have better items in need of nerfing that the Shaman sole claim to fame...the JBB (whose extremely long casting time makes it only marginally useful).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Look, heh.<P>JBB is absolutely useless in the high level game.  It can be used in the late 40s to level much faster and well, for that reason it may need to be nerfed.  Whatever.  I'm an iksar so I couldn't give two rat droppings.<P>Clerics, be quiet.  You have a full xp rez, healing spells and buffs which matter, and if I were a tank I'd take a cleric over a shaman in a heart beat.  Shaman stat buffs are _USE_LESS_.  Shaman AC & HP buffs are inferior to clerics considerably.  Shaman dds are worse than enchanter DDs.  Shaman dots are worse than necro dots and arguably worse than druid dots.  The only reason we get into parties is to slow and give the occaisonal paranoid tank some buffs.<P>Shamans are a strong pvp class.  Having a pet and being able to melee are certainly advantages in _PVP_.  However, with Uber resists on velious mobs we play ZERO role.  It's cleric/warrior/rogue hack hack hack slash slash slash.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wow. I was going to ask if all cleric's were members of the piss and moan club, but thankfully I saw the post from Keldain. At least he is one cleric that isn't acting like a spoiled rotten 3 year old who had their teddy bear taken away and its mad that anyone else has any kind of stuffed animal.<P>Yes I am a shaman. But if I did play a cleric, I'd be very ashamed of my class after reading this crap you posted. <P>You don't want anyone else to be able to help keep a party alive, but you. Your complaining that shamans and druids want the fizzle rate of their heal spell reduced so that when a cleric is not available for a group, they can save folks from death. I simply can not believe this. Are you that selfish that you would rather see players die than have some other class be able to possibly keep that from happening? I don't care what links you post, NOT ONE shaman is asking to heal AS WELL as a cleric. We are described by V themselves as a healing class (psst, read the book that came with the game). <P>Bah. I'm not going over this again. It's been said over and over. You can take your over inflated 3 year old ego and your little temper tantrums and go have a time out. So, go sit in the corner and zip your mouth. I'll let you know when your time out is over troll. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If the JBB was incredibly overpowered and a class-defining item, why did I give it to a guildmate?<P>Because it is nigh useless in most groups.  The cast time is such that it can be dangerous to use unless you are in a 100%-safe situation... Seven or eight seconds isn't "a long time" when suddenly your enchanter gets aggroed on--it's an ETERNITY.  And I prefer grouping, so I gave it to someone who soloes far more often.<P>The JBB may well be overpowered--manaless damage is primarily the domain of melee classes (and classes with pets, when they're up).  However, since the blast is level 34, it's not *really* a blast, compared to the number of hit points mobs have when you can use one--it's a DoT, roughly equivalent in damage per second to our level 49 poison DoT, Envenomed Bolt, IF we're not interrupted, if there are no resists, and if all we have to do in the situation is click it over and over again.  And, each bracer-click costs ~49 mana, in "meditation opportunity cost."<P>I'll be the first to admit that if a shaman can get a bracer at 45, it's definitely a big twinking step, equivalent to giving low-level meleers incredible weapons, because s/he is essentially able to use a DoT from a spell rank above their level.  But at 52, it is becoming a less impressive amount of damage, and I would prefer to use a disease DoT and root when I'm soloing, and do other things while grouping.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053033-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053033-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053033&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053033&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
