</FONT><HR>Tactless wrote:<P>&gt;"Me: Well, it has been suggested, and even responded to. If there is no "party line" you are aware of, please consider this, among other things, a petition for Illusion: Gender."<P>Fair enough.  The last I heard was that this spell just never worked right.  I'll take your petition and run with it.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>&gt;"Me: Race is _one of the things_ as you say, which influences reaction. Remember there is still reputation and religion parts to faction, and I'm sure there would be some way to negate any race-related faction issues in a creature. It seems you have simply put a skin over a standard pet for the mage illusion, and not copied all aspects of the creature when Monster Summoning is used. You also mentioned that this code was specially made for this spell. Is that so unreasonable to ask for illusions too, if need be?"<P>Well, it's not that simple.  I think (not certain) that pets are gaining the faction of their race when summoned.  This is not a problem, really, because having the pet not attacked by the locals is fine, the master still isn't safe.  When the PC can gain these faction bonuses…<P>I'm not saying that it's completely impossible to make such an illusion factionless.  The real questions are, is it worth the time to make it so (and it would probably be a very massive task)?  Would it be worth it to make a spell that is, essentially, fluff?  And, would it be worth it to make a spell that would be, essentially, contrary to the illusion line of spells (consider that faction is one of the main uses for illusions)?<P>Personally, I'd rather see a couple of new illusions that are cool.  But I've mentioned this to the team, and I'm sure that we'll talk about it soon in a more in-depth way.<P>&gt;"Me: Okay, and neither do I. But once there is a model in the globals file, is there any reason why we can't get an illusion for it? this question comes up again later."<P>Sure, there are some.  Like I've mentioned before, there is the consideration of the other classes that already use those forms.  And there is also the consideration of faction mods for forms that are in the global (this will likely mean that they are in use in a lot of places…)<P>&gt;"Me: Well, if you read through three or four hundred posts here, I'm sure you'll see about a hundred of us who HAVE heard of that. If you think we shouldn't have undead illusions, what does that say about our existing Illusion: Skeleton and Illusion: Drybone spells? It seems your personal opinion here is not in line with The Vision (tm) so could you please find out a second opinion on Illusion: Spectre?"<P>Sure.  Keep in mind, that my personal opinion is, well, just that.  It won't keep me from doing my job.<P>&gt;"Me: Okay, borderline class-envy comment here. DAMN RIGHT uniqueness is important! That's our complaint! WE ARE ILLUSIONISTS, but you seem to be giving this unique skill to druids, shamans, and necros, with a nod to magicians, while we get nothing. This is not a nerf, and we lose no skills, and we don't go backwards objectively, but we LOSE OUR UNIQUENESS!"<P>Ah… but didn't you also ask for the Spectre and Bear illusions in this very post…<P>Rather than 'throw you a bone' that at the same time reduces the uniqueness of the classes you mention, I'd rather see something that is actually unique.<P>&gt;"We still have no answer on the main point. Why the changes of tune, and different reasons given for the same thing, then turning around and actually giving Illusion: Spectre (by another name) to someone else? And will enchanters ever become high-level Illusionists in anything other than name?"<P>Well, there hasn't been a change in tone, but a change in technology.  And I would hope that the main point isn't that at all, but your last line.  I'm all for more illusions at higher levels.  My concern is that we don't give enchanters that while at the same time affecting the unique feel that other classes have gained.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Velious enchanter spells are BO-RING!  Those Gift spells that give a little more mana and add a tiny bit of mana regen?  We really needed three of those losers? Gimme a break!  Throw us a bone here. Something nifty.  That Illusion: Gender spell would be fun....or here's an idea...Illusion: Platemail, Illusion:RyGorr, Illusion:Chainmail.  How about an illusion that randomly changes the face we're using, and can stack with a race illusion!  These things have no value except fun.<P>Bristlebane's bundle is fun...doesn't effect game play...Monster summoning is really just for fun.  The pet is no better than the other pets they get at that level, and since the type is random, you only have a one in four shot of having the correct focus item equipped.  This is not a power spell.  Illusion bear?  Bear pet?  The shamans and druids are loving these things like kids on Christmas morning!<P>The Gift series of spells shows a lack of imagination and effort in crafting the new enchanter spells.<P>Come on guys...it's the holidays...we want a cool toy too!<P>Belarios<BR>Twist of Fate<BR>Innoruuk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Very good post! <P>From what I see is happening, Enchanter are being dethroned of their class abilities. Look at all the classes now they can do what we do, in a small form, but put them all together and you have an Enchanter. Pretty soon we will probably see Warriors casting spells? It’s that the Enchanter is my favorite class to play and with every expansion we become class-less as Enchanters.

</FONT><HR>OK, a few minor points.<P>1. This thread doesn't need to be bumped. It bumps itself automatically because it is a hot topic.<P>2. Shaman etc....Verant will most likely address you specificaly in a shaman thread. If you look at the thread topic it says "ENCHANTERS IN VELIOUS". No offense but they just don't respond to other classes very often in class specific threads.<P>3. Illussion gender. I'm not going to look very masculine with "Citra" hanging over my head. I could only imagine some of the more masculine or feminine names and how stupid that might look ;-)<P>4. People who come just to flame. Don't you ahve anything more important to do? Your wasting your life away.<P>5. I'm all for us NOT having spector and bear...although it would look cool I'm glad shaman and necros are happy with thier toys. And I understand your argument. However, we should have gotten something as well....we are illussionists and haven't gotten an illussion in 2 expansions or the last 16 levels.<P>P.S. even if you ignore the points about crowd control in this thread...they won't go away. We will just start a new thread or 8 (hard to get everyone to stay in one thread) and it will keep popping up. I don't like doing my laundry...if I ignore it...it doesn't go away. May as well address them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I COMPLETELY agree with Silh.  Thank you for bringing up an arguement that I have also been itching to get off my chest.  <P>The only illusions right now that is unique to its class are the Elemental illusions and Illusion: Drybone, which are also used as pets for Mages/Necros.  Someone else can have everything that we already have.  Want Skeleton form?  Amulet of Necropotence.  Want Wolf Form?  See your local Druid.  Want Werewolf Form?  See your local Enchanter.  <P>All we want, is at least one 44+ self-only Enchanter spell that no one else has.  If we are the master of illusions, we should get at least 1 that identifies our class and which you need to work toward to use, such as how Werewolf form used to be until the Garou popped up.  In a month or two when the spell is more common, any Joe Blow thats above the level cap can go grab the form.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think the most disappointing aspect of this thread is that I think the core issue isn't really being heard, though it has been stated again and again.  Semantics have been used as a shield, but the issue remains...<P>In my opinion (and, I think, the opinion of many), the compelling aspect of illusions is their form (fun factor) and main "effect" (str on earth elem, damage shield on fire elem, etc).  The faction aspect is secondary... and is generally only a factor in specific circumstances.  For example, once you're over level 34, there are very few reasons for a non-DE enchanter to visit Neriak and use DE form... while using DE form for the ultravision is MUCH more likely.  Remember that the faction aspect is capped... I'm barely scowls to Troll Guards... yet in illusion form, I can't improve beyond threatening.  It isn't as if I can overcome my faction with an illusion.  However, illusions DO get used frequently for fun... for show... and for their abilities (I use air elemental form frequently for free levitate).<P>Now, Absor has repeatedly stated that the "illusions" for druids and necromancers aren't "illusions" but rather transformations.  Well, the same could readily be true of enchanter illusions.  I get strength because I'm an earth elemental... I fight better because I'm a werewolf... etc.  Let's get off the semantic kick and instead focus on the issue.  <P>The issue, again, is simple.  Enchanters have repeatedly been ignored with regards to gaining new uses for their illusion abilities.  No one (hopefully) is asking for more powerful illusions.  What is being asked for is some additional variety when CLEARLY that space could be so applied... but isn't being.  The issue is FUN.<P>As for the complaint of Monster Summoning... I agree that it is a cool new ability.  However, the ability could EASILY have been mimiced.  If I could cast Illusion: Monster and become a random monster (KoS to pretty much everything), that would be wonderfully fun!  Would it be powerful?  Nope.  Unbalancing?  Nope.  Costly in resources?  Nope.  If you wanted to spend actual work time on it, you could let each form have some trivial effect (like our other illusions do)... tiny poison dot attack in spider form... +STR but -AGI in giant form... etc... but this would be a bonus.  The core is just the desire for the fun factor.<P>So let's address the issue... not the semantics.  Please give the fun to enchanters in a similar fashion as you did mages, druids, and shamans.  You can do it... easily.  The only question is "will you?".<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The ONLY reason we would not be granted a few more illusions and make everyone happy is to spite us unless there is a legitimate techical issue (I can guarntee you that there is a workaround somehow, eg take gods/dragons out of global file except on weeks when gm's are going to have events).  As we get further along on this topic the posts are starting to degrade but the issue remains the same, we should get illusions 50+ we have been lied to several times about several illusions by abashi (don't ban me, its the truth) [I have had 3 threads deleted for pointing out abashi's falacies] and we want some illusions, honestly the rest of our spell line gets WORSE 50+ except C2 I think its completley logical to at least give us one thing to look forward too (eg you use level 49 dazzle at 60 &lt;or entrance if you prefer that&gt;, you use level 49 carm at 60).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I feel my earlier posts were pretty explanatory of my feelings in this matter, but the constant argument of "Well, we have wolf and skeleton illusions" should be met with a swift retraction of these spells from enchanter's spellbooks. You have stepped on the toes of nature casters and necromancers one too many times, and your own arguments will rise up against you.<P>Note: That last paragraph was facetious. But I wrote it to illustrate a point. Don't try to get what others have, keep true to working on cool (NON EXPLOITABLE) illusions. Good luck and /stay positive/, ie: don't point at other classes' spell lists to back up your arguments, work from the basis of the enchanter as a standalone issue, and you may get much farther.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First off Enchanters are the master of Illusion and Mind Control.... They should be able to cast any illusion any other class can cast (as they are the master.....)  If Druid/Necro spells are not true illusion but transformations, VI screwed up, and SHOULD NOT HAVE CALLED THEM ILLUSIONS. Simple fix, rename the spells to something more appropriate name. But with that said Enchanters should have more illusions.<P><BR>Now for those of you who said that VI hasn't address the main issues of this post, that's VI's style... they cherry pick a few issue they can (or think they can) defend and ingore the real issue. To see a perfect example read any post about Guild/Surname changes... VI's always defends the Naming Policy (which i have no problem with...) but NEVER EVER address how it was not hahdled properly by the GM... which seems to happen alot.<P>Oh well, sorry to get off subject.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Actually, I'm more concerned with what seems to be the underlying cause for the original poster's complaint.  He said: "You are overlapping what all classes are able to do. Although it seems good at first sight, I think it's not the right decision."<P>I agree that this overlapping often goes on in a fashion which makes me wonder if the full scope of game balance and class nature is being considered when additions are made.  The new Monster Summoning line is a good example.  It's a fun spell; fun to see others' reactions.  It is not a true summons, though.  They're just monster appearances wrapped around a random Mage pet.  It's more of a random pet illusion.  Why use it for real combat when you can summon a pet with the abilities you need instead of essentially a random mage pet that looks like a monster.<P>I'm a mage and I like REAL summons, not illusions.  When I summon blades from the sky, then by golly real steel blades are popping into existance at my command and smiting mine foes.  Why do I have so many evok DD spells?  That's for Wizards.  It crosses us mages over too far into the "territory" of another class.  Just as giving all kinds of summoning abilities to other classes crosses them over into OUR area of excellence.  The satisfaction of being a particular class comes from the differences, and game play should embrace all class' special abilities and limitations.  Distinct limits encourage us to seek out and befriend others with abilities we don't have.  Verant stands pretty firm on the larger issues: not adding big abilities like teleport or SoW to more classes, and this is a good thing.  I think, however, that they loose a lot by diluting more "minor" abilities across classes.  There are many, many examples of this.  Like food, water, pet, etc. summons for (here I exaggerate) all.  And, sure, it's fun for us mages to run around with a pet that LOOKS like a monster, but some poor enchanter is going to be standing there scratching his chin and wondering what's up with THAT?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Maybe you could clarify how the summon monster is not a simple Illusion.<P>From my understanding, it summons a pet with the illusion of a random mob. The pet will cast the same mage pet spells. Every griffon I saw never cast a earth root, or air stun. Yet if a mage summons one, it is an elemental with an Illusion on. <P>If this was just a monster summon in the true sence, it would act like the original mob. And in the truest sence, it would act like a charmed mob.<P>Monster Summon is just a fun spell, and should mages have it? Sure. I think it is a great spell, and very fun. It is way up on the coolness factor. But I love seeing tiny Trolls running around going Weeeeeeee.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I just wish the programers had read any enchanters' posting about wanting more illusions before they made the Kunark spells, and if not that, I wish they read a post or two before they designed the SoV spells. I was hoping that I just didn't find the quest for a new Illusion item that was enchanter only, but from reading the posts, I don't think there are any.<P>Please prove me wrong.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am very disappointed with the enchanter Velious Expansion spells we have recieved.  The Kunark spells overall are marginal at best as they are primarily only upgrades due to the level limit raised to 60.<P>Boon of Garou is severly limited. Won't be using this one. Ever.<BR>The new "Gift" series...who the heck came up with this lame idea? Won't be using this line of spells either.<P>More and more of our spells are being copied in one form or another, being given to other classes.  This detracts from my enjoyment of the enchanter class as being unique.  With the two expansions, and various changes made of late, the enchanter class is becoming less and less unique, as are the other classes.<P>It disturbs me to see Verant's trend, which shows a lack of creative thought and a terrible lack of a focused vision for each class.  I have played many many online RPG's, old text-based ones especially.  I have watched several of them follow this path which Verant is now walking down.  Blending of the classes to satisfy the whims of a very vocal minority of whiners and complainers who  are too lazy to learn to play that other class to enjoy that special ability and instead moan and groan until they gain that ability for the class they are playing now.<BR>I have seen it time and time again.  And each time this happens, the game is severly crippled in its claim to being unique and special in comparison to all the other games.<P>What it always comes down to is this: Profitability.<P>Verant is concerned even more so than ever with maintaining a bottom line.  Which means, limited creative change, since it takes less man hours to modifiy an exhisting game mechanic and apply it to another class with a  differant name.  Just tossing us bones now, hoping that will make us happy. <P>Its not going to work Verant.<P>I won't be using any of the new Velious spells, nor will I waste my platinum on them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I just read VI's official response to the question of further enchanter illusions and the person responding obviously has no understanding of how important outward appearance is in this game, particularly to enchanters.  He also tells us that we are putting too much value on the appearance of mage pets.  He implies that if we believe we are being betrayed by their ill-considered decisions we must be playing our characters wrong.  That is amazingly arrogant for a service company who would not survive without its current paying customer base.<P>First of all, excuse me, but who are you to tell us what we should and shouldn't like about this game?  The market drives game success, not the company releasing the game.  If we feel betrayed, we feel betrayed.  Period.  And your obvious effort to downplay this betrayal as exaggerated is not the correct response to a customer who feels betrayed.  You don't tell them, "We believe your feelings of betrayal are unfounded, (so start acting the way we intended you to act.)"<P>Ironically, the fact that he looks down his nose at pets as being insignificant further supports our assertion that pets should not have more capabilities than us as player characters.<P>Like many, I started an enchanter because of the fun of being able to assume many different forms.  Also like many, I was disappointed when Kunark only added a single illusion.  It was at that time that I also noticed there were no more illusions above level 44 and made my first complaints on the issue (along with many others.)<P>Imagine my dismay when Velious was released and there were ZERO new illusions for the "illusionist" class.  Imagine how my displeasure grew when I discovered that several other classes DID get new illusions. (!?!?)  Then imagine how my anger has increased upon finding out that most of the previously rejected suggestions enchanters have made for our new illusions were used in Velious, but were given to OTHER classes!  <P>You can't tell me illusion specter went to necros because only they should be able to look like undead.  That argument makes no sense.  The original design for EverQuest gave enchanters illusion skeleton, illusion drybone, and illusion werewolf.  Further, we have always been able to assume the same appearance as the pets of other classes.  Enchanters can look like earth, water, air, and fire mage pets.  Enchanters can look like necro skeleton pets.  Enchanters can look like shaman spirit wolf pets.  <P>If you look at these facts carefully, the pattern established in the original design should dictate that necros would have specter pets and that we should be able to look like that necro pet.  Further, we should be able to look like the druid bear pet.  Instead you have arbitrarily taken the illogical path of blurring the patterns that separate classes in the original design.<P>Looking at your choices for expansion enchanter spells, whoever made those choices has lost the logical vision the spell arrangements had originally.  Further, this person obviously thinks of the level 44+ enchanter as nothing more than a mana hose for supporting other casters.  Next time, get somebody who loves every aspect of being an enchanter.  We've waited too long for new illusions.<P>Let me sum up by saying that you won't keep us from leaving when "the next big thing" arrives if you keep dismissing our feelings of betrayal as exaggerated.<P>-Parvo Dragonspirit<BR>A renegade dark elf enchanter fighting for truth<BR>in the alternate reality of Solusek Ro.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

With the next (and surely the final, if they keep on doing this) expansion, enchanters will be able to wear plate armor and wield 1HS weapons, and Warriors will be able to mez.<P>Look, I'll put this in terms that VI can understand: if you keep on blurring the distinctions between classes, people won't bother to try other classes any more.  This means they will leave the game sooner, since lot of people keep on playing EQ to try new classes.  Net: less moola for Vernat.

</FONT><HR>Wow some pretty angry Enchanters.  <P>Sounds like a pretty clear oversight not to have released at least a single new Illusion for Enchanters in Velious to me.<P>I can't say I'm upset because I haven't bought Velious and no plans to buy anything further from Verant unless they consider and address the lack of good 1H summoned weapon for higher level mages to summon that surpasses the Rusty Shan Tok (to replace the nerfed sword) or at least add some sort of foot speed increase to one of the Enchanter Illusions.  <P>Either of those would shut me up or they con continue to enjoy my compliments and praise like clockwork right here because their decision making appears to me flawed and undeveloped.<P>Software engineering got better (03)<BR>Customer Support got better (02)<BR>Keep at it - got quite a ways to go!!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I really like the idea of having a random, invis like duration on a random illusion spell. Or, make the random illusion just for fun, like outdoor shrink. Just give us the look but not the faction. Most people probably don't agree with what i feel but i think running around as a random monster would be great fun. <P>Maybe make it a line of spells so the first one, at a lower level, would just be for looks and the second one would have faction changes but be very unreliable like invis, and the third one, probably level 60, would last as long as normal illusions and give faction changes.<P>Feel free to shoot my ideas down if you want to, i just want abashi or someone to read this because it would definitely make a nice addition to the illusion line up and also keep us from complaining.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hiya,<P>I have been playing the enchanter class for well over a year now on and off and it's the best class in EQ.<P>The improvements I would like to see:<BR>1) Pet commands, how is it I can command any charmed creature yet not my pet. I can command creature with no soul or brain and even Mage pets:P;<BR>2) Target Illusion, well enough has been said on this one;<BR>3) WW form changed to group and reduce casting time and increase duration. The spell could have it stats reduced to make more usable;<BR>4) Gift line made group? If not reduce mana cost and casting time. This is such a pain to cast 6 time in a row, then c2, GMR and speed;<BR>5) Change pet from just a shield and sword to a warrior illusion of the casters race, ie I'm a Gnome and would have a little Gnome Warrior(WOOT);<BR>6) Change Tashani back to a major magic debuff and area effect as it was when first created.<P>Hmm I cannot think of anything else at the mo. I think these idea will not unbalance the Enchanter class. These would reduce the boring asspects, ie continual buffing and inject some fun:P.<P>Regards<P><BR>Quos<BR>Gnome Battlechanter 54.5<BR>PS Enchanter needs plate armour with exta AC and HPs, would be nice, but will never happen </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello all,<P>I'm an Enchanter of the 38th season, and personally I would have to agree with Alan when he mentioned that the real "magic" is how you play your class.<P>I've been trotting around Velious for a week or so now, and yes, I've noticed that the new mage spells are quite the eye-opener (ever had a mage running with a "named" snow griffin behind him yelling for help the whole time? LOL).  To me, that doesn't mean that Enchanters are all washed up, though.<P>Keep this in mind:  Our function in the game (in a group) is crowd control.  Now mages can have all the nifty pets that they want, but they won't be able to have the same sort of crowd control ability as Enchanters....  Sure, the bard can mez now, but we have:<P>Root to keep mobs at bay<BR>Entrance/Mez to keep them quiet<BR>Charm/Beguile to let one fight for us<BR>Memory Blur/Wipe if they get too overpowering.<P>Combine these lines of spells, and we're the lifesavers.  In my opinion, that creates much more "awe" from other classes than just having a walrus attack a frost giant.<P>Once I was in HighKeep with a few people, and the pickclaws got out of hand... there must have been 6 or 7 all attacking our group of 4 people.  In a normal situation, that would spell death.  With an Enchanter in the group, though? ..:<P>Charm one, have 1 attack 2, entrance 3, 4, 5, and 6, root all of them afterwards.  Color Shift the 7th while everyone attacks it... Then move down the line.  If one breaks mez, you re-mez before the root breaks.  If the charm is broken, then Color Shift and re-charm.<P>In the end, we didn't suffer a death, and actually we were all pretty stable afterwards.  Everything worked out great.  In my opinion, THAT'S the "magic" of our class, and people WILL notice, that's a given.<P>- Effa</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>a long long time ago befor kunark they said there would be new spells for enchanters, and other classes in the expansion. i play an enchanter so the first thing i did was come to this bord and make my sugestions.<P>The spells i asked for were group illision spells.<BR>and im glad they finaly gave us the abilty to turn others into werewolves even if they arnt as cool as the original self only form.<P>What i think enchanters should get for illsion spells.<P>Boon of guruo ... pump up the duration to normal illision durations, remove the life tap proc (where did this come from anyway?) infact id be much happier without the dex bonus if they would have just made the spell the same as the self only one. maybe they should make it a new spell and leave this silly version of the spell the way it is, make the new version level 58  (same stat changes as the self only) and able to cast on targets anylevel!<P>with full illisional durations and the same ajustments the self only spells of the same would do.<BR>level 50 group earth elemental form (just gives the mob faction needed to compleat some quests, druids currently cast group wolf form on thier firends so that they can compleat quests they would otherwise not have the faction for.)<BR>level 52 group  water elemental form (water breathing) <BR>level 54 group air elemental form (group levitate)<BR>level 56 group fire elemental (12 point dmg shield)<BR>level 58 group werewolf form (attack bonus and small haste)<BR>level 59 group illision dry bone (fire resistance)<BR>level 60 group specter (this is the form that should have a life tap proc)<P>they may want to give the xcuse that a group of 6 specters will cause to much lag for low end users, and i think they might be right but have you ever tried to pull the 5 specters in oasis? there are 5 of them chasing you arround the newbie zone and you think that dosn't cause lag? give it up latancy can't be a restricting factor... if some one in the group has a problem with lag and the polygon count for specters i am sure the enchanters wont use it, its not like enchanter want to cause lag for themselvs, but just because it could cause lag in some situations.. doesn't mean it can't be added for enchanters to use at thier discression.<P>one of my major concerns is the part about using illisions to help your friends do quests. Why do players have to seek out a druid to get an illsion to compleat a quest! they should be seeking out an illusionest! Enchanter are known for being able to charm mobs for their friends to compleat needed (epic) quests so i would think it would make sense that enchanters would help thier friends with quest with thier illusionary powers.<P>ok thats my sujestions im sure they will get filed off in some dungeon and no one will care again till the next expansion comes out and enchanters are overlooked again.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Citra:<BR>"Your comparison is way off base."<BR>Of course it is, that is why I made it.  You do not really think that I expected Verant to give Magicians crowd control or mana regen spells, did you?  <P>"Illussions are a minor element of what we do."<BR>Correct.  I have to wonder why 90% of these Enchanter/illusion posts either start with or end <BR>with "We are the masters of Illusion"<P>"BTW bears and spiders are not summoned beings..they are born that way. It's a new ability to summon living breathing creatures and make them fight for you. It's called charm. Only permanant duration with a lower level cap. I think since this is monsters that have a will of thier own..there should be a chance they break this "charm" and kick your butt....just like what happens to us. Now that would be balanced, LOL."<P>Charming a creature and summoning a creature are two separate things.  We could get into an RPG discussion about the differenece of excerting your will over a creature as compared to binding a creature to do your bidding, but that really does not matter.  What matters is that in EQ, the game we are playing, charming and summoning go by a different set of rules.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is just wonderful.  The original poster is all up in a tiffy because they didn't get illusions.  Because they're no longer able to "wow" people with what they can look like.<P>I'm even more amazed that this, this so low on the importance of real issues in eq that need to be dealt with, has gotten a really *really* long response.<P>Where's the response to the mana cost on the 55 Shaman pet?  "That's just the way it is," isn't what the Shaman Class is looking for.  850mana for a pet that can only be summoned one level higher than the 49pet (500mana) is, in my opinion, absurd and out of line.  I (along with plenty others) want an explanation as to why our level 55 "it's just a companion guys" (as Abashi put it) has to cost 850mana.<P>Shaman Group Buffs.  They buff less than the single target buffs, and of course, like all other group buffs, wear off quicker than the single target buffs.  What is up with that?  And more importantly, what am I going to do with group charisma?  Come on!  I'm all for fun spells that don't have any practical use..but that spell has very very limited use, practically no use at all.<P>Shaman armors!<P>Cleric Kunark BP:  Casts CH (you know what this one does..)<BR>Cleric Kunark Legs: Casts Symbol of Naltron (you know what this one does too..)<P>Cleric Velious BP:  Casts Celestial Elixir (regen 1000hp in 24sec along with cure)<BR>Cleric Velious Legs: Casts Word of Health (group healing, 100hp each)<P>Shaman Kunark BP: Casts Bramblecoat (lvl 29 druid spell, 18ac, 3point DS)<BR>Shaman Kunark Legs: Casts Health (lvl 34 Shaman stamina buff, 31sta)<P>Shaman Velious BP: Casts Riotous Health (level 54 Shaman stamina buff, 50sta)<BR>Shaman Velious Legs: Casts Abolish Disease (high level disease cure)<P>Clerics get their biggest recurring mana hogs put on their armor.<P>Shaman 51+ biggest recurring mana hog is first: Turgur's Insects (66%-75% slow), second: buffs (celerity/alacrity largest, kragg/tuna being next, followed by stat buffs).<P>But yet on the kunark bp (which iksar can't wear), Shaman get a self only buff.  And on Kunark legs, get a low level sta buff.  But on Velious BP, we get a high level sta buff!  W00t?  NOT.

</FONT><HR>Does any of this matter.  Enchanters are a desired class so they are not going to change anything for us even though countless other classes have been upgraded.  The only real enchanter upgrade so far that has mattered has been to the low level players (ie breeze)  I never had it never will.  Generally we have enjoyed our lot in the game but slowly all our class defining specialties are being given out to other classes. (sorry necros but i was flabbergasted when i was told no let the necro mezz it!! ***???)  <BR>    When kunark came out and titles were announced i laughed.  I even started a thread that it was rediculous to call us enchanters since they stopped at 44 and after 50 when we get those titles theres not one illusion.<BR>    Good luck in your quest to become illusionist, im gonna go play a warrior who now has spell ability from armor pieces.  (Does that blur those class defining issues or what?)<P>Kandi, disillusioned enchanter</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree with Allen that our illusions should effect faction. A targeted illusion should befuddle the witnesses into thinking that you are truly that race. There are people in my guild that still aren't sure what race I am.<P>That said, the illusions are not complete racial faction adjusters. I have never harmed any friendly members of any race (I don't count bandits as friendly) yet there are still cities that I cannot go into with simply that races illusion. Granted, I have not worked on increasing my faction with those cities, but I haven't harmed it either. Thus I feel that any targeted illusion would likely have the same effect. An increase in faction with the target, but not a complete re-factioning.<P>Besides, changing into a sarnak, for instance, doesn't mean you can run around Ill Omen without care. I see sarnak's and goblin's fighting all the time. Maybe this hate code could be adopted to make targeted illusions a possibility.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 8 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/040527-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/040527.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/040527-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/040527-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/040527-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/040527-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/040527-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/040527-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=040527&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=040527&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
