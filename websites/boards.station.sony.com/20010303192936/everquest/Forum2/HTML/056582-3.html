</FONT><HR>First, when I say you, I mean Verant, not you personally Absor.<P>A word of advice.  From all the high level rogues that have posted here, you are obviously fixing a problem that only exists in your mind.  And the fix will do a lot more harm than good, unbalancing the Rogue negatively.  <P>Isnt this counter to what you are trying to do - BALANCE the classes?  <P>Here is the advice you woudl do well to heed:<P>Look to some of the player solutions - they sound like reasonable compromises (put into the middle of the hate list and other things like that).<P>Here is the advice if you continue to ignore your player base:  <P>Be ready to have to back out this change that only you want to make.  Its very reminiscent of the mistake you made with the mage pets.  You are wrong.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi Absor,<BR>   Ive only posted once or twice in the two years ive played EQ. But as a rogue, I feel that if I didnt take a stand now, It would be a sin. Ive played a rogue since november of '99. I love my rogue, and though Ive made many other characters, I have never liked any as much as my rogue. Without my rogue, I would have canceled both of my accounts long ago.<BR>That said, I feel that this nerf is totally unwarrented. In the many months I have played a rogue, I have NEVER ONCE had a MOB run off to attack someone else far away after a successful evade. Rogues are balanced. Please consider the cries and anguish that us faithfull players have expressed and re-consider the changes to evade.<P>As for my only wish, please make sneak/hide go accros zone lines. Thank you.<P>Thoryn Darkblade <BR>Rogue of Bristlebane;<BR>Guildmaster of the Short Norathians Union</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am apologize that I haven't read all the posts before I joined the discussion.<BR>Basically I would like to know what is the meaning of balance. Is it like siccors, paper, stone or we can have a chance to get a mage off? I think it shouldn't be the latter one. But Rogue is helpful enough in a group? I don't think so.<BR>Each time the rogue player said that we are weak and we look like a idiot. Station will provide us some data that we will be good and helpful. But actually we still bad. It is same as a student who knows Newton's law and doing expirment. But he doesn't know there are some friction and other condition which will affect his calculation. I hope you can login a rogue and test what does a Rogue look like.<BR>I will suggest these 2 improve me. Rogue's resist posion will increase as warrior's resist magic. There many tales which talking about someone who keep testing and making posion. Then he become more resist posion. so why a rogue can't?<BR>Another improve is about evade. You should have some fantasy first. =) Ok. .  Start now )<BR>Imagine you are an Assassin. You are going to give a backstab to the target. Then you hit it. It may not success. But you have to escape now because you are staying at the upper position of the hate list. Then you will evade. If your evade success. You will drop to the bottom of the hate list cause they can't target and revenge on you. But if you are fail on evade. YOu will receive one hit, ensure that this hit may completely damaged or miss or dodge .etc.  Then we will drop to the third position of the hate list. Why there are only one hit? because you are escaping. they try to hit you, and you may accept that hit but you are still escaping so you will drop to mid-position from the hate list. Since they know there are a sniper or assassin targeted. They have to take care.<BR>I think it will much better than drop the rogue to the bottom of the hate list each time. Sine this situation will look more storical. =)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I first of all just want to say that the "evade nerf" is not as bad as it sounds.  This will actually make it more useful to me.  I've been in several groups where I was the only melee character, or where I was grouped with several monks.  None of us had taunt, so if the monk had to feign, all it took was one ill-timed evade and I could kiss my group goodbye.  The reason is, when I evaded, it put me below both healers on the aggro list, and their subsequent heals put them so much higher that even after SEVERAL backstabs I could not pull the mobs off the healers.  The new evade will fix this by still allowing me to get out of immediate danger, but not so much that I won't be able to taunt the mob back on me if I want.  As I rule, I evade after every backstab anyway, unless I'm the one that needs to be tanking (in which case, I usually find a different group).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I do have one thing I would like to see added to rogues, though this isn't a skill or anything, but it is (in my mind at least) a balancing issue.  How many rogues out there currently use throwing instead of archery?  Not many would be my guess.  Why use throwing when archery gives more damage at longer range on average, even when considering crits?  In fact, I get more damage from a single shot with my bow than I get from a crit with a 7 dmg throwing spear.  Make throwing more useful for rogues, either by adding more purchasable or player made throwing items (as cheap as arrows of similar stats) or by increasing the damage/frequency of crits, or both.  Currently there's no reason to use throwing unless you're a barbarian (barbarians are the only rogues that can use Throwing boulders).<P>On a related subject, why are there so many throwing weapons that are NOT rogue usable? Monks get a 100 dmg shuriken off of Innoruuk (sure it's a bit rare, and sure it's off of a god... but hey, maybe rogues should get a 50 dmg throwing spear off of Cazic Thule or something at least).  Even more questionable is the Bracer of Hammerfal.  This bracer is usable by every class except pure casters and rogues.  Yet the effect of this bracer seems uniquely suited for rogues... almost as if it was designed for us and then put out there to tease us because we cannot use it.  Not only can we not use it and its unlimited charges of Summon: Throwing Hammer, but Clerics, Shamen, and Druids can... and they don't even HAVE a throwing skill!  I don't think it was an oversight, as it seems quite obvious that the rogues were intentionally excluded from this item, but even so it should be changed so that rogues can use it and the hammers it summons.<P>In addition, I think there should be more items in the game like this... maybe a nice item in Veeshan's Peak or Sleeper's Tomb that summons those 50 dmg throwing weapons I was suggesting earlier... useful for a lot of people, but amazingly useful for rogues.  An item that powerful would HAVE to be in one of those two zones (or perhaps plane of Mischief) however.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, this may have been said already, I didn't read EVERY post, but I feel it is a constructive idea.<P>If Verant insists on changing Evade so it doesn't work as well, then at least let us get BETTER at evading.  <P>Right now, evade fails VERY often.  Pick a level, like lvl 40 or something, and for every level we go up, our chance of failure goes down a little.  <P>As we progress in level, we should only fail maybe 1 or 2 times out of 10.  As it stands right now, the number is more like 4 to 6 times out of 10.  If you don't believe me about the failure rate, just go to any LIVE server and ask the rogues.  Not the low level ones, but the ones in established guilds, the ones that go on planes raids, and to the bowels of Kunark and Velious.<P>I think this is a fair compromise if Verant INSISTS on changing Evade.<P>Heim Macvass<BR>lvl 51 rogue of Rallos Zek<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Short and sweet -<P>Evade change:<BR>I don't see any problem with this until the high 30s when rogues easily start defining themselves for the insane damage. If it is so neccissary to change evade, at very least up the success rate to compinsate. It's only 30% at the moment or something close, no?<P>Make Poison:<BR>It's is fine, stackable would be nice, but that's beating a dead horse..<P>Apply Poison:<BR>Trigger bind wound crouch to apply poinson added, very nice, thank you! ^_^<BR>Apply to OTHER people's weapons. It is possibly feasible if set up like bind wound. The target player must stay still (Even make them have to be sitting and/or grouped with the rogue, and most definately not engaged in combat) and stick some sort of level cap on the poison so a rogue could not put high powered poisons on a low person's weapon to power level (the same reason weapons like the Serreted Bone Dirk don't proc until higher levels, obviously)<BR>Rouges being able to poison the weapons of the tank in the group before a fight would help offset the evade change, since the tanks would hit with that poison right off for an extra taught. Rogues could be more welcomed in group if they are carying poison with them for those exact reasons.<P>Instill Doubt:<BR>You said you're making it work better with backstab, good enough for me.<P>Sneak/Hide:<BR>A gradual speed incread would be nice as levels went up, until maybe the 40s, rogues are easily out done where invisiblity could be helpful because of caster's invis not being seen through consistantly yet.<P>Low Level Quests:<BR>It would be nice if Rogues could obtain Ravenscale through quests set for the 20-45 range as most classes are able to enjoy for their class specific armor. It would make the class more enjoyable in the levels where the full utility of the rogue is not yet fully appreciated.<P>I'm done now. Applying poison to others is the one I'd really like to see to give rogues more value to groups. Thank you.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>No I didn't just make this name up to make a flame. In fact..this is my first time posting on these boards.<P>Now then, I am a VERY casual player, I have a wide range of characters and classes on my server, and I have not gotten very high.  And my rogue is fairly low, I dont even have evade, so my knowledge of what it does is limited, however, I do know through experience that we dish out enough damage, as has been said, to bring us to the top of hate list real quickly.<P>Even though I could make a new page to view the exact words posted on the evade subject, I'm just a bit to lazy, so I'll go off of memory  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>In a nutshell, whats being said is that they have made mob's more versatile by increasing the size of their hate list.  However, due to the way evade works currently(dropping person to bottom of list) this apparently is "broken".  I also seem to recall Arkss(sorry, dont remember exact spelling, I'm tired right now) saying that, somewhat quote: "This essentially allows a rogue to deal a considerable amount of damage, succesfully evade, and then have the mob go off and start attacking someone who is on the other side of the zone who has a slightly bad faction with it."<P>Now then, at first look sure, it seems like a good idea, hell, I'm more or a less a newb so I dont know what this would do, but after reading a large amount(I know how you feel now absor, jeez what a boring task  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif">)of posts I can get a very good idea as to how this works.  Now then, on with what I have to say!<P>The way I perceive this to be is this, if you want to correct me go right ahead.<P>We have Happy the Rogue(Now to be reffered to as HR)on the east side in zone pumpkin bliss(now to be refferred to as PB) and Grumpy the Enchanter(now to be refferred to as GE) on the west side of PB.  HR, who cons indifferently to a Ugly Purple Bear, and GE who cons scowls at you.  HR backstabs and ensues to start layin some serious damage, while being delt a fair amount back.  But HR is a resourceful rogue, and uses evade and succeeds.  Now, a Ugly Purple Bear is no longer angry at HR, and then runs straight towards GE, on the other side of PB, and starts kicking his ass.  Since HR has dealt significant damage, he will get the exp even if GE kills the bear, and he has less downtime. <P>(*All entitys and characters in this writing are completley fictionous, and have been put there for your slight amusement, any resemlance to any existing people, real or otherwise, is completley coincidental*)<P>Now then, this is "Essentially" what a rogue can do.  Now then on to the flame/rant section of this post on the proposed plan: 1)Why is the rogue soloing? He/She should be in a group! Not soloing Ugly Purple Bears in Pumpkin Bliss!. 2) If evade supposedly DOES work as well as is claimed to be, then why arent all rogues soloing in pumpkin bliss with grumpy enchanters? Because evade has a low chance of success, so even if it does drop them to the bottom of the list, they deal such a large amount of damage fast enough, they stuck back in the top hate list sparring w/ the groups tank. 4) Ahh monkeys...I forgot what I was gonna say, but you get get my general idea.<P>Granted, this example is exagerated a very slight bit, but it is almost EXACTLY along the lines that were set.  Now then, the proposed changes are going to "fix" this problem, but since only the "broken" aspect of this can be seen through a soloing career(HAH! Fat chance with rogues LOL)it wont fix it. Because HR and GE could be playing in PB and HR could still kick that ugly purple bears ass, evade, and then just follow it to GE, bind wound, and then deal out a bit more damage for the exp.  Which = No "Fix".  And, as has been said a bagillionzillionillionthousand times, all the "Fix" will do, is make Rogues die faster and more or often.<P>Boy what a long post!

</FONT><HR>I dont thing this is a bug. I believe it to be a balance issue. Although very minor in nature. Maybe it has been discussed, but here goes anyway.<P>Concerning the Invincibility line of spells tha Clerics get. Something needs to be justified. From the RP standpoint, you are blessed by your god with a shield that is not penetrable from either side. If that's so, then why can a cleric be stunned when running from a mob while Invcibible? This doesn't make any sense to me. <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/confused.gif"> I have to be hit to be stunned.<P>As far as a balance issue. I dont think this would create some huge advantage for Clerics.

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>It seems safe to assume the nerf of evade will go through. Although I've tested it tonight and my evade has failed repeatedly no matter the message displayed and allowed me to get pounded to my near death. Since it's very likely going through, here are some suggestions from myself and from the previous posts:<P>1. Allow evade to work more often than it already does. If we're goona have to repeatedly evade every 7 seconds, it should work more often atleast.<P>2. Make the taunting ability of tanks stronger. If the effect of evades changed, but not its accurracy, please atleast make the taunt ability stronger, if tanks can't taunt mobs off us we're dead.<P>New focus:<BR>1. Allow rogues to hide/sneak through zones.<BR>2. Make poisons into charges<BR>3. Check instill doubt accuracy<BR>4. Increase Safefall skill cap atleast to master<BR>5. work on the Ragebringer particle effects<BR>6. really check the accuracy of backstab in the pre 50's. I am almost certain I'm not suppose to miss green mobs that often.<P>If your wondering why there aren't any details behind my suggestions in the new focus, I have stated them again and again in my past posts.<P>Kallus of Rathe </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Alright, before I get started with my really serious bit here, allow me to say a few things:<P>The Rogue, a widely debated class in EQ. No spells, where most other-game Rogues had them in some form. No chance of heavy AC armor (save so-called "uber" items), unlike many other games. These are 2 things EQ has much different from other games w/ Rogues (Thieves) in them. References to the Final Fantasy line, Diablo, and upcoming expansion to Diablo II come to mind. But you know what? Those things don't really bother me that much...<P>The EQ rogue was a whole new take on the Rogue class. Light armor so we can be sneaky and speedy, low HP because we're not built physically strong, we're limber. Double Attack and Dual Wield skills nearly that of a Warrior, with added abilities to steal money / items, find and disarm traps, and poison our weapons (gving us a psuedo spell-system of sorts), along with doing the most damaging melee attack in the game, the Backstab. But above all else, they're a FUN class, and overall, tie with the Bard as my favorite.<P>I enjoy the fast-paced action of a Rogue. Hit 4 times, backstab, "HOLY CRAP the mob thinks I'm the girl he was with last Friday when he was drunk and wants a piece of me! Taunt, taunt, heal, backing outta battle a second... Ok, I'm back in... WHOA, whaddya mean outta mana? Crap, I'm running for it!" This is how my Rogue was fighting when Evade was implemented, at the time against lvl 30-35 mobs in the Cazic-Thule zone. With TWO Warriors in the group. Then it was nerfed to be slightly less effective, so I was forced to wait 10 seconds of Aggro time before I attacked, lest I be dubbed "Sir Hadanelith Mana-Sink Raswrolski of the Veeshan Server..."<P>Now you are suggesting another tweak to Evade, to make it even less effective. As it is, I have to time my Backstabs to come just before Evade is ready or I have a serious problem on my hands. Aside from my lvl 35 Rogue I also play a 51 Druid, Trewaldian, both on Veeshan server. I've worked with many rogues, most who don't meddle in the ways of poison near as much as I do. ("It's useless" they say, unaware of the wonders 5 bags of Lixt Wing Dust can do in Lower Guk, dead-side.) <P>These Rogues are the ones I am healing while the Cleric takes care of the main tank, these are the Rogues I am sometimes forced to watch DIE because it is one Rogue or half the group, save the Rogue or save the Tank and Casters, that is the choice that must be made in some dire circumstances. Evade, force a mob to attack someone on the other side of the zone? Hardly. More like Evade, give the Rogue a fighting chance at making it to the Xp/Loot portion of the battle. A rogue has roughly 1/2 - 2/3 the HP of a warrior, depending on stats and equipment, and roughly 2/3 - 3/4 the AC depending again on Stats/Equipment. If you were to put a value on this, say the Warrior has an 2500 combined score of HP/AC (1750 HP, 750 AC) at a given level, a rogue of the same level would have approximately a score of 1375-1730 (875-1050 HP (very extreme circumstance), 500 - 680AC). Then you suggest that a Rogue should have nearly no chance of Evading more than 4 hits worth, thus forth being able to take the damage a Warrior might? There's a huge difference between 1750 HP and 900 HP in case you haven't noticed.<P>I admit that my numbers are rough, but according to things I have observed with my Wood-Elf Rogue and other Rogues (Of all races, including Barbarian), and most Human / Barbarian / Troll warriors, this seems to be pretty close to on par. Now take a mob such as a Drolvarg Sentry in Karnor's Castle, which can hit for roughly 100 hp... the rogue has 2/3, BEST CASE SCENARIO, the chance of surviving multiple blows compared to a Warrior of the same level. (the numbers are a bit low in comparison to a Drolvarg Sentry, but even regular Drolvargs in Firiona Vie hit for up to approx 87). This is, of course, assuming that a Cleric is ready to heal your chain-mailed, dagger-wielding, low-HP'd, hard-hitting schnazz before you see the fabled Key Phrase: LOADING, PLEASE WAIT.<P>My point in case? I will always love my rogue, they will always be fun for me. No matter how much you nerf, degrade, humiliate, torture, and utterly DESTROY my favorite character, I will keep playing him. It will be hard, and I'd best find a way to make more money for Corpse Summons and Resurrections, because it will be one heck of a lot harder to stay alive, but I will do it.<P>I urge... no, not urge, I BEG of you, LEAVE EVADE AS-IS. I know we (the Rogue community) may have asked for some absurd things... Tracking (which we all love but don't NEED), frontal Backstabs (it's called BACK stab for a reason), Spells (we're only thinking of what other games do), and stackable poisons (that'd be 2 procs on 1 weapon, something currently reserved to the abilities of an Enchanter or Ranger to apply), but the fact stands that they are NOT in-game, and probably never will be. If you never do ANYTHING else for the Rogue class, do this one thing: LET US KEEP OUR DIGNITY! Leave EVADE, AS-IS, and spare us the humiliation of "Will Disarm Traps For Res" signs! There are many things the Rogue community would LOVE to see, but that doesn't mean they will happen, and are just pipe-dreams. But one thing we can ALL agree on is that we DO NOT want extra corpses! The Rogue community has had its chance to speak out on this board, and you have heard what we have to say. You make the choice of what happens from here, but if you are concerned about Rogues being "balanced," then think of how "balanced" they will be when they are no longer played.<P>Sincerely,<BR>Hadanelith Raswrolski (35th Rogue), AKA:<BR>Trewaldian Tildarewn (51st Druid), Veeshan Server<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I try not to spend time ranting and raving about how balanced or unbalanced the game is. I personally love the game. Always have always will. I have seen many changes to the game. I have seen many things done to it within the past two years I have played. A lot of things made me happy (when warriors got critical hits and crippling blows), and a lot of things have saddened me i ways (the 'nerfs' [i hate that word too] on classes such as Necromancers, Bards, and Magicians). I have always been around Rogues, and learned a trick or two from them, and just recently started a Rogue myself.<BR>Personally, playing my character, it gives me freedom to elaborate on roleplaying. I do roleplay quite often in the game, and it makes me happy. I am also an active role in fighting with groups. I know of several Rogues who have 'twinked' themselves with the FBSS (flowing black silk sash), Trakanon's Tooth, Burning Raiper, and Fungi Covered Tunic, and played solo well into their late level 30's and early 40's. My friend on Morell-Thule has a level 57 Rake (rogue of course), and we both have enjoyed this class greatly. I really don't see that much wrong with the class. In fact, I find it quite balancing. There are several things that make it powerful in some areas, and less powerful in others, but that really makes it balanced as a whole. I guess I should lead into some examples...<P>First off, in the changes to Bind Wound. I am all for it. I have had many high level (40+) Warriors. I did find it hard to manage in groups without a healer there (it does happen, and it is unfortunate), and we generally resort to spend 5 or 10 minutes binding wounds of the whole group to 50%. Then we would sit for 15 to 30 minutes just to get around 80% health or so, get up, and fight, only to repeat this same process. The changes to Bind Wound are welcomed with opened arms by all classes. And I thank you for that.<P>Second item is Sneak and Hide. I must agree with some of the posters that it is unfair that casters (Druids, Mages, Enchanters, Necromacers, and other invisible casting classes) can cast invisible and stay invisible at zone or Link Death. I really cannot see why Rogues wouldn't be treated the same way. An example would be: At level 20, I went to Ocean of Tears to join a friend who was waiting for the Ancient Cyclops (AC) to spawn, for her Journeyman Boots quest. Well, the AC spawned, and she got her ring, so she decided to go over to the island with the Seafury Cyclops to obtain her level. I decided that I will go with her. I was over with her, and when she was meditating, I would have some fun, and sneak/hide around the island, literally /hug 'ing the cyclops. It was fun for me until I began to go Link Dead (when the bar mysteriously starts disappearing). I paniced! Here I was, surrounded by monsters that are in upwards of 15 to 25 levels above me, and if I went Link Dead, and logged back in, I would be slaughtered for sure, because when I logged back in, Sneak and Hide would both be reset, and I would be visible for pounding enjoyment. Luckily for me, I didn't go Link Dead (in fact, I managed to 'spam' my way back), slowly crept back to my friend, and shakenly said, "Okay, I am staying here now..."<BR>I just feel that Rogues should at least get this change. It wouldn't be 'over-balancing' or 'nerfing other class abilities'. It would be helping Rogues.<P>On poisons, I really haven't had much experience with them. I talked to my friend (the 57 Rogue) and he uses them quite often. I have talked to other Rogues, who do and don't use them. More often than not, they tell me, that poison making and applying, is a waste of time. I really don't care if the poisons stack or not (I did think that instead of changing the code to make the existing poisons stack, that you can 're-make' the poisons [same poisons] as a new item that does stack, but then there is also the coding on how to make the 'Apply Poison' skill recognize the new 'stackable' poisons), but I would like to see either, a lot more 'worthwhile' poisons, or easier poisons to make. I honestly want to start making poisons, but I have a hard time finding components, getting money to buy/make the vials and items to make the vials, the money to pay the vendors for the suspensions, or the lack in skill and [from what I hear] obscene amounts of money to make it work. I wouldn't necessarily just want poisons to stack, just make it a little easier to work on the skills.<P>On the pick lock/disarm traps/sense traps issue: The skills should be easier to learn, have a better chance to succeed, and have a larger radius of effect (the sense traps skill seems to have a tad smaller radius than it should). Asisde from that, I really see no problems with it. Not many people actually use the skill. But I think it would be a nice fix for those who do use it. For example, on the sense traps skill, people who reach a certain skill level (say 150) the radius would be increased to a 50 feet diameter.<P>And now the issue at hand. Evade.<BR>The easiest way to put this is this way: I agree with everyone else that evade should not be changed, or changed so drastically. If you begin talking to a zone of people about damage dealers, and who does the most damage. Most of the times, they will rank Rogues as the first, Monks as the second, and Warriors as the third. And I would have to agree. It is also player experience, that the more damage you do, the more the 'mob' will hate you for it (such as in real life, if you insult someone a lot, they will hate you more, and more, and more, and more, until they get to the point to hire Billy the Thug who can cut off out your tongue and hang you from the flagpole on the 34th floor of the Empire State Building). This brings in evade, or 'quickly hitting buttons til you don't get attacked' method. As a Rogue. I find myself constantly getting attacked. A small example would be an event that happened a few nights ago: I was in Lake of Ill Omen hunting Sarnarks, Goblins, and Sabertooth Cats. The party consisted of me, a Cleric, three Warriors, and an Enchanter. It was decided, that Warrior number 1 would pull, since he had the highest hitpoints and armor class, and not me, who had Journeyman Boots, because it would be better for me to not automatically be on the direct top of the hate list so I can start doing heavy damage from the start. As Warrior number 1 would pull the 'mobs' to the group, I would hide/sneak behind the mob, and wait til all three tanks where attacking and taunting (we made this agreement before we began to pull), then proceed to attack and backstab. For a few round, maybe about two or three, the Warriors would be getting attacked. It wasn't until I got my second or third backstab off, that I would be the prime target. It really doesn't matter if I landed the backstab or not. I would start getting attacked, and it would take four or 5 rounds to get the 'mob' taunted off me to the point where I could get another backstab off, only to be thrusted to the top of the hate list, and attacked once again (even if this backstab failed). The same would occur on the next few 'mobs'. I am not saying, however, that it does this everytime. There are sometimes where I can stay an entire fight without getting attacked once, but it is rare. I find, that with the new formula you have figured out, while truely a nice way to work it out, would not be effective and 'balancing' as you would be lead to believe. I seem to recall mentioning of how the hate list was extended with the release of Kunark or Velious, maybe both, and how the rogue's evade skill was not 'tweaked' enough to accomidate (spelling?) the larger hate lists. However, the damage dealing comes into play now. With the release of Kunark and Velious, came new weapons. Namely Rogue weapons with high damage and low delay (which was a general upgrade from the Serrated Bone Dirk, the prime choice for Rogues pre-expansion), such as the Crystal Grinder, and the Slime Coated Harpoon. Both these weapons outrank the Serrated Bone Dirk in terms of damage delay ratio, and therefore, do more damage to the 'mobs'. So with the common theme of 'the more damage you do, you will get attacked more', these weapons need to be offset with the original evade: evade bringing the Rogue to the bottom, or near bottom, of the list. It has also been from personal experience, that fighting a 'mob' with other people around (where the mob would 'aggro' on them and attack) and evading, doesn't make the mob leave me alone and attack them. It keep attacking me. So I am not quite sure the meaning on a 'mob' aggroing on the others if I still can't get the mob off, even after running half a zone away (the exception I have seen are some skeletons and undead, but they generally attack the nearest person anyway, or I have found). Before I begin to bore you with more incessant drabble, I will get to my point. Don't change evade, or don't change evade so drastically as you are thinking of (to the point where rogues will be bumped to between the 2nd and 3rd person on the list) but make it lowere, maybe to between the 5th or 6th person, that way we aren't the lowest, and in a six man group, we will still start getting back at the top fairly quickly. To me, if the changes do go into effect with the current settings, you should try to offset the 'Rogue pounding session' that will usually occur (ie. raise the armor class, or increase the skill success rates of skills like riposte, parry, and dodge). From the people I have talked to who play rogues, many will abandon the class (or leave Everquest entirely) if these changes are made, because it means 'instant death' just by backstabbing 'if' you do manage an successful evade [their quotes, not mine]. And honestly, I would hate to see that happen.<P>And my last point is about Instill Doubt. I find this skill to be an excellent and very useful skill. From the Rogues I have talked with/grouped with, they don't care much for it, because it doesn't seem to work as much as they think it should. I have seen a level 60 rogue sit there for hours (on those boring sitting-waiting-for-the-cleric-to-get-mana-for-a-rez sessions) just instill doubting the same 'mob', which just happens to be around level 30 or so, sit there and not do anything. It is very discouraging to see such a useful skill go to waste because it doesn't succeed as much as it should. I personally use this skill in every fight (as well as practice it where ever I go) and it seems to work a lot (but a lot of people call me intimidating anyway), but when it does work, a lot of times it gets resisted. That's right, resisted. I just gotten this skill above 100, and it is still resisted by mobs that are ten levels under me. A simple solution I could see to remedy this problem would be to lower the resist rate as the skill gets higher, and let it succeed more as the skill gets higher (say a 50% chance it succeeds when the skill is maxed out, because at the time it is maxed out, many rogues will be fighting in the dungeons anyway, where it isn't safe to fear 'mobs'), and then from levels 51-60, raise the skill cap and allow a 75% success rate on 'non-uber mobs'. That would seem to make it a more useful skill and a reason to actually use it in a lot of cases. I would love to be able to hit Instill Doubt when my party is all below 20% health and have the mob run away while we zone or evac.<P>I would like to thank you, who ever you are, for reading this post. I know it is quite long, but I feel there are a lot of valid (and as a friend pointed out, moot) points. A response to any of these comments would be greatly appreciated. Keep on going, and don't let anything take you down.<P>Pexx Preemoh<BR>Wood Elf Rogue who serveth Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>  In regards to Rogue changes,<BR>Hmmm, it doesnt matter what else they do to our class really.Once the evade is nerfed we will no longer be a viable class after 20.Until 20 we can actually fight up front usually,the same for most classes. After 20 with EVADE being nerfed we shall have 3 choices 1)Not play rogues 2)Enjoy dying alot 3) Not be a rogue. Soulbound lockpicks,poison resist, etc will mean nothing .We already have less than a 30-40% chance of success, with massive taunters (ive had 2 warriors an SK AND a Wiz not be able to taunt them off me when fighting ONE white/yellow/red mob).<P>  If any there has played a rogue you'd know that 70% of the time , We hit Evade(fails) and wait not attacking while our taunters(meat or castor) try to taunt them off , taking major damage usually . Now considering that most castors have more hitpoints than me(or close), this isnt good.<BR>  Now considering that i have a habit of grouping with several tanks and castors, and still die because i cant get the mob to lose agro in the process usually draining our cleric of mana who is trying to keep me alive.Dropping me to only 3rd on hate list is a joke.Not only will i die, but usually the rest of the party because our healer is OOM from trying to heal me.<BR>   Take the above into consideration and also remember that a soloing roggue is a DEAD rogue, how many party's will i get into? How viable a charcter will I become to play?How many will just stop playing rogues?<BR>  And to adress the issue of DAMAGE MASTER's.The only reason we are considered damage masters is because we are able to backstab.We dont do more damage in attack except for our backstab.Most of our bacstab's hit for less than 50% of max.Id guess bout 70% percent of the time.Now if we arent able to lose agro, which we wont with the nerf. How many backstab's do you think we will get facing the mob pounding on us? Pray for a stun so we can run around? Then you've just written off rogues completely.Only thing we would be good for is corpes retreival- im not even going to touch sneak/hide. And lockpicking. Both of which youd actually have to gain experience in level's to get a high skill. Which wont happen because we have to group to get exp, and we WON'T find any groups willing to take a group killer.<P>  Ive seen alot of possitive changes the last couple years, ive see very few negative ones.Ive played all the classes and most race class combonations.I love my rogue because he is complicated and sometimes frustrating to play.This change in EVADE will make him near if not impossible.<P> Little fact for you.Durring my stint as a cleric, at about the level 30.I opennely refused to allow a rogue in my group and would leave if they took one.Why? This was before EVADE.A rogue would kill my group.I spent all my mana healing the rogue to watch it die, then to watch the rest of my group die because i was OOM.That was if I was alive.I hunted on a regular basis with RL freinds. One a monk, the other a ranger. 2 of my RL friends who had started rogues and wanted to group with us had to restart because almost every player didn't want a group killing rogue in there group.Including me, their REAL LIFE friend !!!<BR>   You did this crap to me when i first started playing EQ after it went GOLD, i loved my ranger.He got deleted.Im not going to bother deleting characters anymore , to be honest.Too many good games coming up hot on EQ's butt .Sure they might not be perfect when they release, but I remember EQ when it was released.<BR>  <BR>   Well this is long enough, if you make the proposed EVADE nerf you will once again see the rogue population drop.And to all those that have spent time playing their beloved rogue, you will most likely see them leave in sadness and disgust.<BR>  Oh and to some who say upping HP and AC to compensate.If i wanted to be a warrior, id made a warrior.<P>Grunthor Macstabb- Master Puller , Innoruuk<P>Burning Rapier...an ok Offhand weapon <P>Ravenscale Armor..hahahaha,sure if im a twinked newbie,though a couple peices are ok.Too bad ill never get it all till 50 and I buy it off a twinked newb.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Kendrick has stated that he took a large group of testers on Test Server and tried a Velious encounter.  We..he died first attempt and his EXCUSE was he missed the timing on an evade because of battlespam.  <P>My problem with the evade nerf as it stands is NOT with dam velious encounters.  I want to know how it will affect the typical group of 6 gameplay.  I play in a group with 1 warrior, 1 rogue, 1 enchanter, 1 cleric, 1 druid, 1 shaman.  With these evade changes I can see me being the MAIN healing sink.  Warrior taunt SUCKS!  I will DIE!!!   I fail more like 60% of my evades cause i'm getting the crap pounded out of me and I'm moving backwards from a blow.  <P>If you screw with evade this way..PLEASE fix evade so movement isnt in the fail equation.  THAT is SOOO unrealistic.  That is lazy programming at its finest!!!  Why CANT I evade when I'm moving...DUH!  Wouldnt a real life evade involved movement??  <P>If you all havent realized that SoV will be the demise of EQ, well here is a great example of it.  In the name of balance, they will "fix" evade, make their UBER Vel encounters meet the Vision (tm) and slap each other on the back and move off to Galaxies FAR FAR AWAY!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have only been playing this game since Sept and I only played a Halfling Rogue and is of 28 seasons. Clearly to me my Rogue is incapable of soloing blues and can not survive a heated battle as a Warrior of  the same level or other tank class straight up. The ability to provide a solid backstab is usefull but staying alive soon becomes the focus of battle. I would  venture to say that a rogue needs the ability to take either take less  hits or  have more of them. Either more class armor or allowing Agility or Dex to play a greater role in Ac for  those wearing lighter armors would be more roleplaying like effect.   Maybe a change to the parrying skill could be an Option.  Make it a choice allowing u to parry a foe like a duelist allowing others to attack. Rogues overall need a stronger defence as mobs tend to smack us a around relative to our lack of spells that other classes get or high hit points & AC of Warrior. <BR>Taebbon<BR>28th Seasons </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Hail and well met,<P>     As one of the previous posters on this board, I too have been playing my rogue and EQ for about 2 years, June '99. I must say that I have seen almost all there was to have seen in and about the class. Heck, 2 years and Im just now getting through level 40! lol My point is, I've been here, done that, got the t-shirt ( and even the Burning rapier TWICE ;-) ) All I have yet to see are the post 50's stuff, and the raid environment. However, I at least like to believe that I learned a great deal from what I have seen, the development of the class, and the balancing of the rogue in EQ. <P>     Let me begin by saying Verant, as a team, and with no credit or ill repute to one induvidual, because I know it is a team, and not one person as many people believe, has done a GRAND job in the development of the rogue class. June '99's rogue was has blossomed into that which we see today, February 11, 2001. Poison is in game, evade has given more of a stealthy feel to rogue battle, items, weapons, armor galore. The world is nice for a rogue, as compared to the past. <P>     Well, with that said, let me give to you what I see, what I believe, and the ways in which I could _possibly_ see these ideas implamented. Ill try to break this up into main categories.<P>( I )COMBAT:<P>1)EVADE- Well, evade is one of the key aspects of the threads here. As far as I have seen, evade actually works VERY well, but not "too well" as you stated. Now, perhapse this is simply due to my observations. Your codding, according to you, includes more spots on the hate list then it previously did. The only loop I can possibly pose to you in this is that though the rogue goes to the bottom of that list after evade, he is much higher up on it after he lands even one regular melee hit. Thus, after going from 1 to 60 (theoretically) he is soon back up to at least 4-6 due to his involvemet in the direct melee. I dont claim to have the greates of knowledge of the actua numbers and such, but this is what seems to be the case with my observations.Now if the hate list now keeps track of everyone in the zone, it seems to me that there are going to now be legions of hyper omnicient mobs out there, hating everyone before they even see them! lol ( just a bit of humor, not my take at all on the current state of things) As is, I am happy with the skill, and it in no way actually frees me of any danger in a battle, it just allows me to stay where I should, behind the mob, backstabbing, just as taunt allows the warrior to keep the mob facing him, not allways perfect, but it works a good amount of the time. So, quite honestly, I dont think it needs change, but what will be will be.<P>2.)Damage Dealing- We are fine, one of the best if not THE best heavy melee classes, save for monks.<P>3.)Damage taking- Agian, as stated in previous posts, would be neat to see a more "dodge-parry-agility" based defence system for the rogue than compared to a warrior, who uses his or her great stamina and heavy armor to survive a battle. I invision a rogue moving like a butterfly and stinging like a bee, to use the old cleche'. Granted, a monk should have more of an emphisis on that than any other class, but perhapse re-evaluation how different the AC ratting of a rogue and perhapse a warrior are, at comprable levels and armor worn, as well as maxed skills as far as defences are concerned, and then seeing if  there is apossible tweak that could be done, I.E. more direct agility based defences, or just a hightened doge/parry/defense network for rogues ( and an even higer one for monks, if the results show a better effect then just relying on raw ac for these two, or maybe even all, classes) but like I said, this would be neat, I'm not dissatisfied with the current state of things, but this MAY be one of those often overlooked factors in the ballancing of the entire picture, not even for the rogue alone ( but please dont think me overly boald, im not trying to tell you how to do your job ;-) Just playing the part of customer, giving a suggestion from my point of view.)<P>( II ) Poison<P>1)Variety- BEAUTIFULLY done as far as variety and scope of abileties avialable. From DD to DoT, to snare or even a buff. Not strong enough to eclipse a caster, eitehr, so it is not unbalancing in its scope.<P>2)Application- again, I really do not have any problem witht he 7 second sit ( or seeing your enthusiasm in the idea) Kneeling applications, good effect, even in a roleplay situation ( Roge needs to handle the delicate poison carefully, making sure not to have any contact with it, or else it may be contaminated  or contaminate her! )<P>3)"Packaging"- In this, I mean the LONG debated poison stacking. Now, I see what you mean that recodding the game to accept poison as a stacked, clickable, skill based, rogue only , multy effect, primary inventory item is, in all respects to how you see it, impossible. Now, what about making it a regular clickable item, ala Stein og Mogguk to the fungus you get off of the Fungus guys in guk ( name eludes me) or even brewed drinks. In this regard, you make the effect of the item the same ( I.E. the application of the poison) however, instead of strinnging a great deal of code out in order to make it something different, what about making it a rogue only, multi-charged item, that, when clicked springs the apply poison skill to go into effect, and then, if successful, the poison is applied, one charge is taken away, and the effect is applied to the rogues primary weapon slot ( as I understand the system to work) as it origionally does. Trying to code the poison sytem now to accept multi charged poison will not work, but as I heard one of the weapons and armor guys say at the Fan Faire ( great time btw ;-)) you are now not looking to change the code, but trying to trick the old code into doing what you want it to. This could be the trick you need to make multi poisons avaialble. Wish I was a great programmer, so in that light I could more fully understand what the fact of the matter is, but what I DO know of programming, and what you are doing, this may be a great option. Just a note, I do not believe multi charge poison would be unbalancing. As it currently stands, a rogue would spend JUST as much time making the poisons as before, only now, he/she would be able to carry a bit more then before...it doesnt make the creation easier, but the carrying and management would be. The only time sinc avoided would be the travel to and from a bank or such, not the actuall difficulty of the skill. Who knows, I WOuld absolutely LOVE to hear your feedback on this particular issue, above all else ;-)<P>( III ) General Class Items of Interst<P>1) Masks- Now I may take a lot of flak for this, but I love the mask situation as it is, I mean, the guise of deception is a mileston most rogues look forward too, as should be the Iksar and erudite varieties ;-)<P>2) Traps- I am anxious to see what can be done with or for traps. An invisable or hard to see mob designated as a trap would be neat (looks like a trap instead of an orc Lol) and maybe try to hide the mob name, like is appearant with almost all skelons, or even an object of the environment (sorta like lava) that can harm or be deactivated for a matter of seconds ( to allow for movement of a group for example). Point is, I think traps, though not a direct effect on the class, would ad a measure of balancing to the rogue, and give teh skills he still has, a chance to shine.<P>3)Pickpockets- I like the intended changes, gives level 60 rogues a reason to use their skill again! lol I cannot and willnot try to argue the "way it was" with the seperate loot pool stuff, but I at least like seeing a skill being useful or at least usable again :-)<P>4) Weapons- Now, this is actually a VERY personal opinion, but, I notice a lot of spears and daggers in game forthe rogue, all of comprable speeds and damages, but, I personally am a fan of teh rapier. I have noticed a lack of intersting stat rapiers after the burnning rapier. Granted, there are some, but not as many rapiers as spears or daggers. Ive always susspected the genereal idea of teh three weapons are that, daggers are fast, but weak, spears are strong but slow, and a rapier is an even balance. Maybe there are more rapiers in game, but if not, please add more, mundane or extravagant ;-)<P>    Well, that is about it from this windbag...If you read through that whole thing, I not only thank you for listening and trying to see my point of view, but I salute you for being able to read all my ranting! lol With great regards and thanks, to Verant and all my fellow rogues<P>Kudos, <P>Rooksarii Talonbane, 40 Rogue of Tunare<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor....you better be reading EVERY post in here and taking EVERY one of them into consideration.<P>Now, on to what needs to happen with the rogue class: in a word NOTHING, this evade nerf is rediculous! We dont evade enough as it is! If you decide to nerf the evade aspect of hide, then remove the evade part COMPLETELY, to compensate, give us feign death, or maybe shadow step that lowers hate as an ability with a 5 or 6 second reuse time. Sound fair?<P>I want to know why in the world you even start these class talk posts. Think, when has there EVER been a single time that you have done something for a class other than nerf it?! Every time somebody gets an idea that something is wrong with a class or something makes them too powerful, what do you do? Nerf it WITHOUT testing on a LIVE server yourself! Come on, you and I as well as everybody else knows that you do little to no actual testing BEFORE you nerf something. <P>Go ahead, nerf evade, oh, by the way, dont forget to delete the rogue class while you are at it! I said it once and I will say it again, if you nerf evade, we NEED one or more of the following as compensation:<P>1 - Feign Death with the same cap as the monk version.<P>2 - An innate shadow step ability. (one of the worse ideas, I know)<P>3 - More HP, the same as a warrior.<P><BR>4 - More natural AC<P><BR>5 - A higher regen rate.<P><BR>6 - Mend. That works more often than the monk version pre - 100 skill.<P>7 - Evade to work EVERY time at 200 skill.<P><BR>I  could go on for days, but I won't. I am just making a point. (Though I as well of a lot of others would like to see rogues get  feign death)What you are proposing is NOT fair, if you nerf rogues like that, take bash and kick away from warriors, make ALL spells cost double the mana, take away the AC boost from warriors..get the point yet? All thats happening is you are CAUSING a balance issue, DONT MESS WITH EVADE!!!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
