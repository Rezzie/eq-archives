</FONT><HR>Well most of the obvious wants have already been stated, i.e. Defensive skills, archery issues...  <P>I thought of something I don't think has been brought up.  In one of the earlier replies to this thread someone mentioned the lack of Dark Elf trackers, and someone else mentioned Rangers being thought of as somewhat rogue/druid more than warrior/druid.  Well one thing that would be a nice addition to the class would be if Mask of Deception was usable by rangers.  I don't see this in anyway causing class balance issues, and it's not unreasonable at all.  Rangers have a way of blending in, they blend in with the good races through their natural form, they blend into nature with wolf form, why not also blend in with dark races?  I can't give a reason why it would make the class more powerful, but it's not about power in this case, it's about fun, it's not asking much, and I really feel it would make being a ranger more fun to play, and a bit more unique.      <P>  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well there's a problem with the whole `masters of pulling' thing, at high levels all the track in the world won't do you any good becasue if you get too high on the aggro list you'll be green paste. A lot of rangers have had to stop being the groups pullers becasue of this.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Something you could think about for us Rangers is something like a self-only bind that we could cast in any outdoor zone. We are a class that would know the lay of the land well enough to where something like bind should come natural. Make it like something they receive at like level 22 or 25. That in all honesty would be the only thing I would need. I dont care about adding more spells or making us more warrior like, just that since we are kind of a solo class Bind would help us so that we dont have to run 4 or 5 zones to get our corpse back.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, Rogues got their first Absor responce about 30 minutes ago.  Is our coming soon?  We are dying to hear what is being considered and what will not be.  IE: I fully expect to hear a resounding no on ranger gate/bind or earlier SoW.  I also fully expect to see an acceptance of raising ranger defense to match Pally/SK offense.

</FONT><HR>First of all, I love the recent Ranger changes and I think the proposed spell changes are also in the right direction.  However, all of these offensive changes are turning Rangers into the supreme suicide machines.  Rangers dish damage and have self-damage shields, but don't take hits well.<P>First, I accept that Rangers are not meant to take hits.  They have fewer hitpoints and lower AC than other melee classes.  However, a Ranger's strength should be AVOIDING being hit.  When a Ranger and a Warrior go up against a creature of their level, the Ranger should be hit less, but hit harder when hit.  Having lower defensive skills and avoidance skills is a double (triple, quadruple?) whammy.<P>Rangers should have better PARRY, better DODGE, and better DEFENSE than they do now.  In fact, Rangers should be the best or right up there at skills that avoid damage.  Rangers should be poorer tanks based only upon their lower hitpoints and lower AC (tied to equipment not as good as warrior).<P>Secondary, but still important, there should be some consideration of a self-bind or self-port/evac of some sort.  This ties into the belief and I think necessity, that Rangers should be better than others at avoiding damage, whether in battle, or roaming the world (this is NOT true now).  Rangers right now have to tie themselves to cities.  As a level 1 Ranger, I was bound in Qeynos Hills and was a guardian of the forest and it to me.  I cannot bind there anymore, as I am now dependant on cities.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just going to summarise what I want from whats been said.<P>-  Lower the resist rate on Jolt<P>-  Increase our damage output, either thru better offensive spells or improved melee capabilty.<P>-  Improve the trueshot disciplines damage output, this should do far more than melee damage as this is a disciple, this discipline used to make the bow symbol on our inventory make sense, in it's current form it doesn't.<P>-  Give us something to make us more RAID viable, whether thru improved pulling abilites or the increased damage output.  (The trueshot discipline would be a good way to improve this)<P>-  Increase our riptose skill, slightly more defense but also more offensive output.<P>-  More unique spells, the spells currently on test are pretty much worthless to a Warder, and have limited capabilites to an Outrider in a normal group/raid situation<P>- The mentioned spell stacking issues.<P>-  Make the Runed Scout Armour easier to get/more accessible, currently alot of the other classes can merely hunt in PoG and have their armour dropped, in a high level situation where your most commonly with a guild it benefits the guild more to hunt in PoG than to run around doing everyones time consuming quests leaving rangers/paladins and druids at a disadvantage.<P>Basically I'm in the pro-offense camp, increase our damage output, but also increase our damage avoidance thru jolt or an evade like skill.  <P>-------------------------------------<P>Sharfeer Lonespirit<BR>Warder of Xegony<BR>Illumanti Sancti</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have played a ranger now for 52 levels.  Most of what I would say is already here but I want to add my voice to the masses.  I think you'll find that the vast majority of us are in agreement on this.<P>How to balance the ranger:<P>1) DEFENSE - We are supposed to be light, agile fighters.  Make us so.  Our defense, dodge and parry should cap HIGHER than a warriors.  Why?  I've worn both plate mail and chain mail and fought in both.  Trust me the chain wearer will out dodge, manuever the plate wearer every time.  That doesn't mean he'll win the fight by any means but he will out dodge.  No ifs, ands or buts.  I think this is all the defense enhancement we need.  Let the Warriors, SKs and Palys keep the AC and the hit points just make us what we are supposed to be.<P>2) OFFENSE - The changes on test are great here.  Just what we need.<P>3) GROUP DESIRABILITY - We DEFINITELY need something to make a group want and in certain cases NEED a ranger.  Let's face it the Warriors, SKs and Palys will always get chosen over a ranger for tanking.  Rogues and Monks will always get chosen over a ranger for melee damage.  So, where does that leave us?  At this time we really have no class defining ability that makes us preferable under any circumstance.  All the things we were supposed to be "masters" of are no where near unique and we're not even necessarily the best at them (i.e. Archer, duel weild, tracking).  We need to be made the clear master of at least one of these and in a meaningful and group friendly useful manner.  Failing that something else must be created that is unique to us.<P>4) MAGIC - The new spells Call of Earth and Strength of Nature are both great ideas and could go a small way to making us desireable by groups BUT because of their stacking issues with more desired spells they have not had that effect.  Jolt NEEDS to be lowered in level, to at least 51 if not 49 and made more useful on bigger (i.e. Velious, Uber) mobs.<P>Thank you for giving us this thread to air our views.  I hope you will see that these are reasonable requests that would balance the ranger class.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I noticed several people talking about trading jolt for evade.  Having a rogue I understand the evade ability and I honestly don't have experience with jolt BUT:<P>1.  Casters should cast spells.  Pure melees should get unique skills.  Jolt fits better as a spell for Rangers from a game world perspective than evade (rogues are dark and rangers generally are light, as one point of discussion.)<P>2.  Jolt, evade, and feign death are all hate management abilities/spells.  Mem blur is NOT ENOUGH for a ranger since it wipes some or all of the WHOLE hate list and the real problem is rate of hate accumulation.  Jolt and evade properly move the ranger/rogue down the hate list.  Evade is an arcade spell and requires the rogue to:<P>a.  stop attacking--if you're moving it fails<BR>b.  'hide' (hit the hide skill button)--the button must be white<BR>c.  succeed at the roll--based on 'hide' skill and probably succeeds 60% or so when skill maxed at level<BR>d.  have others on the hate list nearby to be attacked (or an aggro monster just turns back on you)<P>Jolt has a series of resists and apparently increases hate if the monster resists (yes...resisting spells STILL seems to increase hate more than actually missing a spell...talk about back***wards.)  Jolt:<P>a.  Takes time to cast (1.5 seconds according to castersrealm) while evade is mostly instantaneous<BR>b.  Takes mana (60 is pretty large, though it IS a high level spell)<BR>c.  Occurs late compared to when the AC and defense discrepancies start at level 39<BR>d.  Is most valuable if a good tank is available (SK/Warrior/Paladin) and in melee range same as evade<P>3.  Ranger ability to manage combat as a "secondary tank" or "light tank" is strongly affected by poor defense/AC.  It is even more strongly affected by the poor effect of stats on gameplay (particularly agi) and the lack of tradeoff for defensive skills when heavy armor is used.  One suggestion was to put a weight limit on Rangers, but I think it fundamentally makes more sense to cut down the effectiveness of the defense skills if heavy armor is used.  The trade off SHOULD be heavy armor but hit more often v. light armor but hit less often.  (Verant has FAILED to implement THAT game, and the one that is implemented requires more hate list management instead.)<P>I fundamentally believe that giving evade to Rangers is a mistake from a class differentiation perspective, but Rogues would probably survive that change.  I believe it would be better to lower Jolt to when it is needed (level 39) and make it a faster cast (0.5 sec) and less mana (20 at most) AND make it lure-like or lifetap like from a resist perspective.  The latter is particularly important as the monster spell resistance goes up and may be the single most important reason to CONSIDER giving evade to rangers (since it does NOT get a spell resist roll).<P>On the other hand, Rangers not being useful at high level is symptomatic with a complete breakdown in the game design process at high level.  IF monsters have 50,000 hit points then it only seems fair that the typical party should have about half of that damage come from melees and half from magic users.  I believe Verant would be hard pressed to demonstrate that even 5% of the damage comes from magic users in the high level game.  The hybrids suffer through the same comparison precisely because the spells which should make a tremendous difference in combat can at best contribute to the 5% while their combat abilities seem to contribute less than half of a warrior, rogue, or monk.<P>The game is fundamentally broken from a gameplay perspective and the best description of the problem is mudflation.  Verant MUST rebalance melee v. magic or throw up their hands and admit that their vision sucks at high levels since magic users and hybrids really can't affect fights all that much.<P>Alan:  just admit it out loud and deal with it.  Trust me that the players know the problems and we're trying hard to overlook Verant's tendency in the past to ignore problems.  You asked us to deal with you honestly, but you're absolutely ignoring some of the problems that are being raised in these threads.  Admit them all and then tell us which ones the company actually plans to deal with and give us time frames.  We're patient or we would have left already...but unless you want us to leave for the next game, deal with us honestly and forthrightly.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I would think that maybe, just maybe a rp example could be made for using the guise of the deceiver.. Faydark's champs want to spy on the evil cousins in Neriak.. <P>But, it's such a minor thing. <P>I think that all rangers right now are either Tunare or Karana worshippers (don't think you can be agnostic as a ranger, not sure). So blending in with the evil folks would only be practical if we were spying on them, not because we want to help them. Again, such relatively low importance when compared to most of the other stuff.<P>Keep the changes on test.<P>Ditch jolt (again, useless against high MR mobs, and there are a whole lot more of these now than there were pre-velious, it seems the way of the future), and disarm.. <P>Give us evade.  <P>I was thinking of an Improved Harmony as well, but couldn't decide on what level it should be obtained..53? I mean, that's a damn good spell, and 53 is what... Storm Strength only? Also with the larger aggro radius in many dungeons, you would want the range to be longer thant Harmony. <P>Harmony has always been a little flakey when it comes to whether or not it has stuck on something, please look into it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well most of my concerns were mentioned but the main problems I see while playing my ranger is the defense cap needs to be raised. Rangers taunt too much(with just plain melle) and cant take a hit at all. Raising it to the paladin/shadow knight offense level would be good since they are the defensive hybrids and we are the offensive hybrids.<P>Second concern is about jolt. This really needs to be lowered to level 51 and an upgrade given at 55. As stated above rangers taunt way to much with just melle damage, this gets more noticeable post 50. I didnt think there was a problem pre 50 so I think making it 51 would be right. And the upgrade at 55 would be for the more resistant velious mobs that are quite common. Maybee give the upgrade a lure type check.<P>Cant wait to get the tracking changes we have been told about either. Please get them in asap.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1) Defense should be upped minimally (220-230)<BR>2) Dodge/Parry/Riposte should be increased tremendously. As light armored, dual wielding attackers, it is horrendous to think that paladins and shadowknights (in heavy plate armor, wielding one weapon) can Dodge/Parry/Riposte better than us.<BR>3) Archery should be much more powerful than it is.  There's nothing more annoying that shooting your party members, and when you do find an opening you hit for 80 damage tops with double damage (post 50); why would you consider doing this when you can just jump in the fury and do some real damage?<BR>4) Tracking filters or a scrollbar are ESSENTIAL.  If these cannot be implemented for coding whatever reasons, then a range finder should be created.  When you begin tracking a target, you are given the range to that target, with the same units as the range on our bows.  Countless times I have been asked to track QuestMob01 and I get pummelled with "Are we there yet?", "How much further?", "I have to pee! Can we stop a sec?"<P>ex.<BR>You begin tracking Elam.<BR>Elam is ahead and to the right, about 600 paces.<BR>Elam is straight ahead about 550 paces.<BR>et cetera.<P>I don't know what kind of units are on bow Ranges.. make up something.  I think this is very doable, every character in the game has a coordinate position; it is simple algebra to determine the distance.<P>[51 Pathfinder] Henklin (Wood Elf) &lt;Spirit Guardians &gt;<BR>Saryrn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Tilara, I was just about to post something about Forage, you beat me to it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Funny thing is, with a 200 skill in forage I forage more gold, flowers, pebbles, barc... well you name it, than food and water. I actually have to buy water these days. A 30 bard I met while waiting for the Catliff (sp?) in Mistmoore a few weeks ago said all he forages is food and water. Lower cap = better than a master 200 skill? Same goes for tracking. Make it possible to filter Forage as with Tracking, if we're supposed to be masters of these things.<P>Another question (which I hope you other Rangers out there can answer?) - is it/will it be possible to change the con colors in the Tracking list? As they are now, the blue is so deep/dark blue I can't read what it says. Can we change these colors in the, say, eqclient.ini file today? Will we be able to do so?<P>And a comment. Harmony 2. Not a bad idea. It would make Rangers more useful and wanted in dungeons, something I find to be one of the most painful things today.<P>--Dark, 51 Half-Elf Ranger<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'd like to see Arhcery improved beyond discipline changes. Specifically, I'd like to see Rangers gain limited access to poisons and then combine these poisons with arrows. I think this would help dish out a little extra damage through the bow since you could dot a mob with it. I do not believe they should even come close to the rogue skill, but as wanderers of nature it seems reasonable that they could make natural poisons.<P>Second, I'd like to see the tracking changes completed, to allow scrolling, etc.<P>Third, consider making rangers bind differently. Maybe they can bind in certain forest zones in addition too cities, or possibly instead of cities. <P>I am not a ranger but I have friends who play them. I will therefore not comment on any other issues, for I can not articulate on them as others can. <P>Granamyre Nevermore of The Watchmen<BR>35th Druid of the Mithaniel Marr </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>These thoughts are based on the first EQ character I played to any significant level, a Ranger named Renada on Povar who is currently 24.  Certainly I learned a lot I would do differently if I were to start over with a Ranger.  Much of this knowledge has made it easier to level my current favorite characters faster than this.  They are a Druid and an Enchanter.  I retired my Ranger for about a year in favor of the other characters, and also some lower level characters which I play occasionally, specifically a level 9 Bard, a level 7 Necromancer and a level 16 Cleric.  I've recently started to play my Ranger again in part because of some better equipment my Druid and Enchanter have obtained for Renada.  Since Renada was my first character, he made it to level 24 entirely on his own efforts and was not twinked in any way.  I will try to detail in this post the frustrations and rewards of this experience.  I stopped playing Renada in frustration about the limitations of the Ranger, and my perception that they are the most underpowered class.  It will be interesting to see if the proposed changes affect this.  I have some specific goals to complete and will see if I start to like playing a Ranger again.<P>Some general observations:<P>Tracking:<P>I loved tracking until I reached about lvl 22.  At that point the number of things I can track overwhelm the number I can see in the display window.  Velious UI may change this, I don't know.  It became very frustrating when I could look around and see the Scythe beetle I wanted to kill while I couldn't see it in my track window.  Or when I use trackiing to check what's around, then sit down to med and have a hill giant immediately start beating on me.<P>While '/trackplayer off' helps some and I like added 'con' functionality, some sort of scroll bar or distance filter would be helpful.  It should work better (or at all) in hilly areas.  Its unfortunate when a skill is better when you first learn it than when you have mastered it.<P>Fletching:<P>I spent a lot of time building up this skill and the only use I make of it is constructing my own class 2 arrows.  I appreciate the changes being made in trade skills in general, and would like to see arrow damage more comiserate with their cost.  For instance a class 2 arrow and a 20 damage bow do 21 damage.  An arrow costing 4 (or so, I'd have to look it up) times as much will do 22 damage.<P>Underpowered:<P>When I started playing my Ranger again, I was in Lake of Ill Omen.  I did a simple shout for a pick up group.  The first comment I got was that Rangers were the worst class in the game.  This started a shouting match with more heat than light and actually more supporters than detracters.  I finally said that I'd rather be a Ranger than a biggot.  Which got a response from the original commentor that essentially some of his best friends were Rangers.  I mention this because it points out my impression and I think many people's impression that we are underpowered.  The main complaint I have about being a Ranger is those situations where I know I'm going to die and there is nothing I can do about it.  I can't gate, I'm far from my bind point, and I'm being hit too often to cast snare, or its not sticking.  I see that Warriors have a similar complaint.  I don't wish to start a flame, but my impression is that for many of these situations, if I had been a Warrior I would have been able to last long enough or been able to do enough damage to kill the creature instead of it killing me.<P>What to change:<P>From the Warrior discussion and others, it appears that the decision a Mob makes as to who to hit is based on who is hitting it the most, not the overall damage being done.  I think we would all be happier if it was based on overall damage rather than frequency, and if Taunt skill worked better.  I suggested an Int based check for Taunt elsewhere as even stupid mobs will get angry when they expect they are being made fun of in ways they don't quite understand.  This might unduly penalize the Ogre Warriors though.<P>I would like to see classes be more distinct and different.  I would not ask for better spells, esp DD, AoE, and DoT but for our class defining spells to work better and be more unique, ie Snare, Root, and perhaps Harmonize, better Agi and Dex buffs perhaps.  We do need to be more effective in melee however that is handled and others have addressed this better than I can.<P>Archery:<P>Apparently archery changed after I stopped playing and is now quite broken.  This is a skill I used to depend on and I think it should be fixed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>For those who are saying the don't want more Offense because it will increase agro, PLEASE take the time to understand it doesn't work this way.<P>It is the NUMBER of ATTEMPTS that increases agro.  Fast dual-wield weapons do this.  Increasing Offense does not increase the number of attempts.  Our low defense and HP also add to that agro, making us look like an easier target for the mob.<P>Proof of this is Rangers who get agro hard when even just trying out a new weapon for which they have a low skill.  In spite of always missing, they still get hard agro.<P>So, to restate: increased Offense will NOT increase agro.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A skill that I think would be usefull for the ranger class would be called something like PARRY.  It would be a skill selectable like Kick or Sneak.  Basically what it would do is Stop the dual wield skill from working while activated, and would increase the defenseand chance of parrying of the ranger by using the offhand weapon as a shield of sorts.  The Ranger is then doing less damage and getting hit less thanks to increased defense/parry and would be easier to taunt off of, but he/she is not reduced to backing out of combat or casting some silly spell.  This skill could become usable after dualwield is available and could not be abused since there is a significant negative impact of doing less damage if you left it turned on all the time.<P>Just my thoughts o nthe matter.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>RANGER SKILL CLARIFICATION<P>Seaul - Good post, however, I would like to clarify further so that others and you understand my thought better<P><BR>From your post:<BR>3. Ranger ability to manage combat as a "secondary tank" or "light tank" is strongly affected by poor defense/AC. It is even more strongly affected by the poor effect of stats on gameplay (particularly agi) and the lack of tradeoff for defensive skills when heavy armor is used. One suggestion was to put a weight limit on Rangers, but I think it fundamentally makes more sense to cut down the effectiveness of the defense skills if heavy armor is used. The trade off SHOULD be heavy armor but hit more often v. light armor but hit less often. <P>I Agree wholeheartedly, With my suggestion of a weight limit, I was speaking in reference to the suggested skill that would automatically max or significantly multiply the remaining DOGDE PARRY RIPOSTE Checks when we are attacked.  <P>Assume a weight limit is place on the Skill and the skill is implemented<P>I currently find my weight at or about 90 with Ivy and Weapons (plus sundry items in my bags). I usually have 20-50p and little else.<P>Now Lets say I am attacked - If there was a ranger Deftness skill - Each blow the mob attempts, currently the AI checks my AC, D(lvl) /P(lvl)/R(lvl) skills and if unsuccessfull, supposedly checks against my agility for and damage mitigation.  I then receive a dame message for that blow.<P>What I suggest is that if I am infact a light tank (say 90 stones for discussion) and I have the "deftness skill I suggested. the following would happen<P>Mob attempts a slash<BR>AC check happens<BR>Deftness Check (weight below Max - Yes)<BR>Deftness Check (Agility 131 buffed  - roll requires 125 min agility (could be 0-200) - Yes)<BR>Deftness Successfull (all D/P/R at 252 or *multiplier to exceed 252 for this attack)<BR>then check against D/P/R<BR>IF these all are unsuccessful perhaps Deftness would allow a saving roll against the final calculated damage (say upto 50% of final damage)<P>A MOB Glances you for 50 damage (assuming D/P/R all failed but saved against damage)<BR>instead of;<BR>A Mob Slashes you for 101 damage<P>SO the result would not be an increase in AC, it would not require defensive skills raised - it would mitigate some damage for the "light Tanks.<P>Mostly it would make us that Cat like predator that we should be.<P>A leopard or a mountain lion are not built like Grizzly or polar bears, but are to be equally feared.  <P>This skill would do NOTHING fopr our Tuant Factor, nor should it, however, it should allow us the opportunity to be what we should be - Cat like preedators - able to dash in and strike blows and avoid contact.  <P>If We want to play like a bear, then we should be built like em.<P>Sorry if I ranted there.  <P>No flame intended but I think this "type" of skill could run a long way to allowing our Light " weight be an advantage in a group<P><BR>Dyarrig Lawne</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hmm... Very interesting threads. <BR>I feel the pain of consistently being beaten down on too. <P>In the early days of creating Ciyan, the template suggests that your attributes will help define your character. i.e. high str means more damage. <BR>The Ranger template (we all share this) has a pathetic base str, but an agility that is exceptional. I actually increased Ciyans agi rather than str thinking that this would make him more difficult to be hit as described in the template. Survivability.<BR>Major mis-conception there! <BR>Futhermore we get agility enhancing spells very early in life. Seemed logical that we should take maximum advantage of this with our class.<P>The problem that I see, as we increase in lvl, our defense seems to fall off. It would seem logical, that with this higher than average agility that defines our class, we would be able to dodge, riposte, and avoid ALOT of damage which would normally be absorbed by a warriors high HP base. If the defence caps where kept, but agility actually enhanced our abilities, we would effectivly be balanced in our defence issues. <P>As it stands, with all the shaman buffs and AGI gear I have, I can exceed an agi of 200 easily, which will increase my AC *slightly*, but does really nothing in the end for avoiding/preventing damage with skills.<P>If we're nimble, I'd like to see the game reflect this. It is the reason why we have light armour at best, is it not? Have the higher agi be more significant in game play, similar to how str enhances damage output.<P>Ciyan  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Now, I play a ranger as my main, and in general I am very pleased with him. The one thing I am VERY happy with is the recent ability for us to cast spells and not reset our melee delay. Up 'til you guys did that, I wouldn't even use my spells while I was in combat. Now, the ranger class gives us many advantages and disadvantages compared to other classes, and that's what should happen; just like every other class should be. Why? Because this is how balanced classes should be. I enjoy the ranger class because we get the fighting ability of a warrior, although not equal, but it should be, and the spell-casting of a druid. I don't have a whole lot to complain about on the melee side of the ranger, besides the skill cap increases, but many people have already mentioned that. What I came here to talk about was the magic side of us. Now, yes, most of our spells come much later compared to a druid. Which, I can understand. Yes, some of them, I would enjoy at having at earlier levels, but the one that concerns me the most is the always infamous: Spirit of Wolf. It is and always been one of the most beloved and asked for spells in the game, next to asking for teleports or rez. Now, only three classes in the game get Spirit of Wolf, shaman, druid, and ranger. Shaman at 9, Druid at 14, and Ranger at 39. This is the only spell I have a problem with, that is a problem with when we get it compared to other classes who get it. Druids get Skin like Wood at level 1, ranger at level 9. Makes sense. Not too late to not be useful and a nice spell for a semi-tank at level 9. But when you look at the levels at which other classes get it, it doesn't make that much sense; 9, 14, 39. I love playing my ranger, but if I could only change one thing about the class is that we get this spell at a earlier time. Now, since, spells don't come too often for rangers, I would have to say level 30 (Altough, I would prefer level 22, but that would be just a bit too close in levels there) Another thing I thought of was to add in in the middle between 22-30, something like 25, but that wouldn't make too much sense to add a single spell in one level pre-50. Unless, you moved the 22 level spells up to level 25, which, I think, there would be a lot of rangers who wouldn't too happy with that. So, in closing, I think you did a great job with the ranger and the game overall. But, it would help the ranger class out greatly to get Spirit of Wolf at an earlier time.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Thanks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I like the idea of being able to do a lot of dmg and be the dmg dealing hybrid.<P>Idealy i would like to see it so we can do enough dmg in short bursts, then use deagro tatics to save our hides, then join back in the battle and still autdmg a warrior.<P>IF we can't autdmg a warrior what real use are we in uber mob and epic raids...We will never be able to soak up dmg like a warrior.<P>Anyway good luck and hunt well.<P>Tilian <BR>40 ranger</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm very happy with my Ranger and I think that I have lasted just the right amount during fights.  Its a heck of a lot longer than the bards thats for sure.  Here is the only balancing issue I see:<P>Paladin is part warrior/cleric.  The cleric definining characteristic is resurrect - Paladins get resurrect and a special skill (lay on hands).<P>ShadowKnights is part warrior/necro.  Necro defining characteristic summon corpse - Shadowknights get this and special skill(harmtouch)<P>Ranger is part warrior/druid.  The druid's defining characteristic port/evac - No port/evac no special skill<P>My idea is that rangers get a few self teleport at 49 maybe 1 to each continent (this is 30 lvl's after druid gets them) and maybe even an evac at higher levels as a group friendly spell.  Then a specialty skill similiar to lay on hands and harmtouch.  Call it Natures Call or something, not sure what to have it do but maybe offensive (heal) same as the others or defensive (gate or scale of wolf speed to escape).<P>If you looked at the stats closely I'm sure you can nit pick that this should be higher than that, need more hp, ac, or whatever.  Stats can be changed with gear.  But I think when you get down to just the class itself it comes down to these 2 things that those hybrids get and rangers don't.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Most of the points that I would like to mention have already been covered, but there is an issue of sense that I would like to bring up.  Many posters before me have tried to define the Ranger as a class, I've heard "sons/daughters of Druids", "woodland Rogues", "Monk-like" and so on, but the fact remains that the key to balancing the Ranger as a class lies in it's historical precedent.  If you read any classic fantasy literature (Tolkein's LOTR is an excellent place to start), you will find that Rangers are depicted as woodland WARRIORS, using SKILL to face their daily toils.  In that vein, they should have Warrior-like abilities.  They are master's of the bow, highly skilled trackers, cunning, alert and deft.  While they do dabble in magic, it is in a very limited fashion (if at all).<P>This leads me to the conclusion that the keys to balancing Rangers are as follows:<P>-fix Track and Archery.  We should be the unquestioned masters of these skills, and they should be a significant presence on the battlefield and off (longbowmen rendered the English efforts in medieval France virtually invulnerable).<BR>-give them better "passive" defensive capabilities (the deftness/evasion ideas from before really hit a chord)<BR>-DO NOT go slap-happy heaping wacky, unrelated spells on the class, they actually serve to dilute it's core ability.<P>My 2cp worth.  Hope it helps.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Zubris, NO.  No more spells for these things.  Give us real fixes.  Spells consume mana, spells wear off and have to be rebuffed, spells wear off at the worst time, spells can be dispelled by the mob you're fighting.<P>Hochimihn, I don't think you understand what Fireflies is for.  It's to raise your conjuration skill so that you can actually use Stinging Swarm first time you get it.  Try getting Conjuration to go up when you fizzles 99 times out of 100.  Then you will appreciate being able to practice with Fireflies.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Rangers can be pushed into the same role as rouges (melee damage) without takeing away what makes them unique.

</FONT><HR>I read my previous post, and was unsatisfied with it; so here is a revision with added information.<P>Okay I have a lot to say since my main character is and has always been a ranger (since July 1999).<P>Let me start by saying that some of the changes are great and appreciated however some are too little too late.<BR>I'm happy that you are focusing on lower level rangers, but none of the level 22 spells that are on Test will help me now.<BR>We need to look back on WHAT a ranger is.<BR>A ranger is a hunter with a bow and arrows who lives off the land.<BR>This is my first complaint about rangers: there is no real use of the bow implemented into group play.<BR>Sure we can solo better with it, but this is a group oriented game; the ranger should excel at archery not be exactly the same as a warrior.<BR>A warrior has the same critical hits as a ranger, but normally has higher strength for harder hits.<BR>This actually makes some warriors BETTER at archery than rangers.<BR>We need something to seperate Rangers from other bow users.<BR>We need something original like magic arrows that can poison, or stun.<BR>Maybe we should have bows that shoot fire arrows or somthing that would make using a bow worth more than just pulling a Mob.<BR>I personally have a raincaller, it's great for stats, but that's it.<BR>With only five unrenewable charges, I don't intend to ever use them.<BR>Archery is a difficult skill to build, I personally have over 150 skill and miss almost every shot: that is unacceptable.<BR>Also, it's not very realistic to be standing on a hill and be unable to shoot an arrow at something lower than you.<BR>The heighth issues with archery are unrealistic and need to be changed.<BR>Make rangers more like a sniper with magic archery abilities (stay true to the original concept of what a ranger is in traditional roleplaying).<P>My second complaint is spell based ( cause quite frankly I do NOT think any class should match warriors in Def or Off ), but we are half druid, and this needs to be emphasized more heavily.<BR>One of the first things to define a ranger spell-wise was snare.<BR>This has been stripped of Rangers and WE NEED IT BACK.<BR>Now Druids, Wizards, SK's, and Necro's can all snare so whoopty do that a Ranger can.<BR>We need a snare that overpowers the other classes; I mean at high levels of course, we should get a snare with a bonus.<BR>Perhaps snare will also slow a mob or dot it, not a massive complement to snare, but perhaps a 20% slow or a 100dmg DoT.<BR>Just anything to bring back the pride we once had in the spell.<BR>We are supposed to be half warrior, half druid, that's why we are called Hybrids.<BR>I'll tell you Absor i sure don't feel like a druid.<BR>First I really have to question why our meditation skill stops at 39, why is that?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/confused.gif"><BR>My wisdom is very low (due to lack of decent ranger wisdom equipment), yet I still have to meditate for 20 minutes like a level 39 ranger.<BR>I am, however, grateful for the mana boost that you granted us, thank you.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cool.gif"><BR>Second you don't see any rangers quad kiting.<BR>I'm not saying we should be able to, but my god at least give us bind or something other than druid spells 25+ levels later than they get them.<BR>Some of our spells are so weak that our parent Druids actually laugh at us for the level we get them.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/mad.gif"><BR>Perhaps rangers can get a weak shaman pet, I'm not saying we should have a level 49 necro pet, but rangers are the true friend of animals, not those treehugging Druids.<BR>We should at least get some of the animal charm series.<BR>One improvement that would help rangers greatly would be to increase the duration of our buffs.<BR>I have to recast three to four buffs every five minutes.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><BR>A thought, which would benefit several classes, would be to add two more spell slots in fullscreen mode, there is plenty of space for this.<BR>I believe this would promote the use of some of the more obscure spells that collect dust in the spell book.<P>Because almost all of a Rangers skill are capped between lvl 39 and 50 I think this is the best place to start improving the class.<BR>Also, I agree that the disarm skill (at the current skill cap for rangers) is quite useless.<BR>This is a very difficult time for Rangers, so the spells and skills we get at 39 have to carry us to 50.<BR>Also, we are the only Hybrids without an ability.<BR>Sk's get HT, Pally's get LH, Ranger's get...well stuff that a lot of other classes already have  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">.<BR>VI is trying to balance the classes, maybe you can never achieve that.<BR>Think more about individualizing classes instead.<BR>Ranger need an ability too.<BR>Yes, pluses to defense and HP's would be great, but I'd like to see a little more originality from VI.<BR>I would like to see a slight increase to ranger HP, and a dramatic increase to ranger defense.<BR>I am satisfied with ranger offense being where it is, except for dual weild and double attack.<P>In conclusion, I say to all my fellow Rangers, 'This is our only chance to glorify our class; do not stand back and accept mediocre spells as balancing us with our parent classes.  Instead, insist on original thought, individual skills, and better defense to survive in melee.'</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, here is my personal bias as to what would balance the ranger class: <P>1) Give jolt lure level resists. It is pretty clear that at the high level, rangers are not tanks, but damage dealers. Rangers should have a fairly reliable way to reduce aggro, even on 100percent magic resistant mobs. A ranger should be able to nuke, snare, duel wield in combat, and be able to avoid most of the attention, most of the time, with jolt. Many "good" rangers forego the use of spells at lvl 50+, just because of the excessive aggro this causes. This should not be the case. A ranger should not be "afraid" to use his nukes, given judicious use of jolt. <P>2) If rangers are to "step up" to the damage dealing plate, they will need to use spells. Ranger melee damage is comparable to warrior damage. There must be some benefit to choosing a ranger with low hps and ac over a warrior, spells must be it. Currently, we have 3 damage dealing spells, all fire based: Call of Flames(lvl50), Firestrike(lvl52), and Calefaction(lvl59), doing 200, 300, and 450dmg respectively. Now, I have no problem with these spells except the recast time. Call of Flames has an 18second recast time, Calefaction has a 45 second recast time. Firestrike has a low recast time, but at 4.6 second cast time, it is questionable as to whether this spell can be cast in combat situations. Considering the total mob hp's at high level, and the built in penalty for chain casting (ie, aggro = dead ranger), is the recast time a bit excessive? <P>3) Fizzles. There have been numerous complaints of excessive fizzles on our high level spells. This is similar <BR>to caster complaints, except most rangers dont carry nearly as much wisdom gear as druids. (Higher wis = lower fizzle). Please look into this. <P>4) Tracking. Rangers should be the premier trackers. This is slated to be addressed in a future patch, but I would just like to stress how important this is. Rangers are the 3rd best damage dealers and the 7th best tanks. Rangers need a "selling point" to get into a group. In my honest opinion, the current tracking bards and druids get is 90percent sufficient to meet most groups tracking needs. I would examine the correlation between tracking skill and range very closely. Currently, a very low tracking skill will allow you to track things withing "normal pulling range". There should be a real benefit to having a 200skill, as opposed to a skill of 50. <P><BR>[Edited by FarseekerTZ on 02-01-2001 at 05:08 PM]<BR>__________________<BR>Farseeker Trueguide <BR>Nos Byth <BR>Lvl 49 Ranger of Tallon Zek<BR> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Indoors harmony, while an awesome idea and I would be lying if I said I wouldn't want it, would trivialize a lot of dungeon encounters.  Some dungeons were designed to have multiple mobs attack the party at one time, and if there were ever an indoors harmony spell I think a lot of dungeons would either have to be retuned, or there would have to be a resist check... and a failure would result in mass aggro.<P>But I feel that indoors harmony just does not fit in with the outdoorsman persona of a ranger.
