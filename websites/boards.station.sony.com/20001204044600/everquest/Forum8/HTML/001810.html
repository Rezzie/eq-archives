</FONT><HR>Now that I've made 52 and I've gotten sooo bored with trying to level as it's sooo slow I started working on other aspects of the game.<P>So, I thought I would start trade skills.  Being a necro however I had to fix my factions.<P>One month later<P>Now that I'm loved I grab myself a bunch of guides and recipes and a bunch of plat and had at it.<P>After just one Saturday I became a master potter, baker, blacksmith, brewer, fletcher, and jeweler.<P>All it took was going to vendors, buying supplies, and making them.<P>I was surprised to discover a few things.  <BR>Brewing - to get any higher I need a druid/ranger to forage me some items and then I cap at 168.<BR>cooking - uhm, what recipe is harder than rat ear pie?  hello?  I'm at 142<BR>Blacksmith - all the way to 200 with just vendors, very boring<BR>Fishing - all the way to 200...takes time<BR>Fletching - all the way to 200..just vendors<BR>Jewelcraft - all the way to 200..takes lots of money and just vendors<BR>Pottery - up to 148 and then I had to start hunting, but max at 188<P>My point here is that all these skills take just a little time, faction, and a chunk of change and you can get your skill to master.  A few require PC interaction to get skill as high as possible, but it would appear to be the last 30 points<P>And now my true point of this post.<P>Tailoring. 100% PC interaction or 100% NPC hunting.  The only way to do this is hunt for spider silks or skins.  <P>There is NO vendor which sells any kind of skin or silk.  <P>To max this skill, which by the way maxxes at 115 with known recipe of tailored quiver,  you must kill a million and one spiders, and then a million and one animals.  OR, take your patterns and bug the hell out of people trying to buy them.  It literally takes a week of playing to max this skill.<P>Please justify this.<P>I can't see it being unbalancing to have a vendor who sells spider silks and a LQ pelt.  I'm not asking for HQ pelts to be sold at vendors, although that would be nice.  It's just that in comparison to all the other GENERAL trade skills that everyone gets, this is completely different.<P>I'm looking forward to the improvements to the other trade skills after seeing what has been done to blacksmithing.<P>I am just hoping that this can be addressed.<P>Or maybe weight reducing bags will be tailorable therefore justifying the huge time investment compared to all the other skills. <P>Thanks<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1. To get above 142 in baking, you need to make items with chocolate in them.  Max is 168 I believe.<P>2. You couldn't have gotten to 200 in smithing from only buying STOCK items from vendors.<P>3. It has always been known that Tailoring is a longer pain than any other trade skill, strictly because you can't buy needed items from STOCK merchants.  You need to employ several means in order to get what you need.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Trade skills aren't focus on you being unlimited on money.<P>I'm lvl 9, and I love the challenge.... I don't have the money, and I HAVE to hunt for everything to work out.<P>Smithing is 25<BR>Tailoring is 34<BR>Baking in 40's<BR>Brewing is 30's<BR>fishing is 12<P>   I have about 100plats...  a lot of luck with High lvl not looting their kills... hehe  And the moment I hit lvl 10, I'll be working hard to raise some of these skills a bit... Maybe spend not more than 50plats, and hunt for the necessity just for the skills.  I have 1 1/2 stack of silk threads and 1 stack of swatches just doing casual killings of spiders in past 2 lvls.<P>Now, if I was lvl 50+ with unlimited resources...  I could buy almost everything... and there would be no challenge what-so-ever.  You can buy silks from Newbies/Lowbies, or go to venders where the Newbies/Lowbies hunt.  And try to find a stash of what you need.. if you have that much money to throw away, that should be a no brainer.  So many talk about doing that.<P>I'm a scrooge... so I refuse to buy supplies, I prefer wasting time instead....  Considering I'm a very Casual player with not much time each night...  It's very easy to fill 45 minutes on just killing spiderlings and Large spiders...  At least I'm not frustrated in thinking I don't have time to do a quest, find a group or go somewhere specific.<P>It's fine the way it is...  Start a new character, and try this with no money... You'll then see that Interaction, and hunting is crucial to advancement.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As to number 2 above - Fine Plate will take you to 207 or 208 currently, all stuff bought from vendors (vendors several zones apart from each other *urk*).  Evidently Large Fine Plate has higher trivials than Medium for no apparent reason.

</FONT><HR>I would be disappointed over having gone the path of killing lots and lots and lots of spiders and cats to have gotten to 115 in tailoring (by buying some spider silks and HQ cat pelts too) and now have items that throttle one's progress be available from NPC's.  What's the point in having so many PC's that are master smiths or jewelers or tailors anyway?  There is no distinction in it.  (I have a friend for example that took the short course on smithing and with several hundred plat and 3 to 4 hours, voila, he too is a master smith.) <P>At a skill of 195 in smithing, I've noticed a tremendous fall-out in smiths actively making and selling fine plate.  My failure rate is down to 10% so I can afford to cut my prices and still double my investment.  Maybe some have opted for cultural armor but that is not a possibility for my Erudite mage.  Dunno.<P>The point here with smithing is that though it was easy to get to 175, my experience has shown that it takes 450 or so pieces to get to 195 (where I am not in skill).  And all this with an INT of 190 to 204 during this time!<P>I suspect there will few continuing on because it comes down to a lot of time to get to grand master or 200.  Time and persistence is the differentiator with tailoring as well.  Please let it stay that way with pelts, skins or swatches.  I feel I've accomplished something that will be nerfed my making the skill-up items available from NPC's.<P>So, simply put, master is one thing, grandmaster (and a skill level of 200) looks like still another thing -- especially in jewelcraft and smithing.<P>But, I can always console myself with whatever Verant decides to do with these two notions: we are in their world now AND it's only a game.

</FONT><HR>I guess my point was being missed and re-reading my post I can see how.  I apologize.<P>I agree that being a grandmaster should be something of pride and take time and effort.<P>My point was the disparity that existed in tailoring vs other trade skills.<P>Since they made a big update to blacksmithing and made it what it is today, I was putting in a suggestion when they do tailoring, please consider adding a vendor so that likewise becoming a master is easy, a grandmaster - time and effort.  Just looking for balance, that's all.<P>As it is now, I'm happy I never used any training points I didn't have to.  Doing tailoring was easy as I had lots of silk from camping the Dread Widow, then used my training points for the rest.<P>I'll quietly not mention I'm a gnome necro who is still sad at tinkering.  Also, due to no quest to improve faction with my guild, I cannot do any gnome quest to get better prices in Ak'anon as ALL of the gnome quests ruin my guild faction.<P>But, here's hoping<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I imagine the tailoring patch has been delayed by all the Velious work.  They mentioned various hints about new trade skills stuff going in with Velious (though it might be shortly thereafter), so I think we'll find some new stuff soon.<P>Specifically mentioned in the past were high quality silks made by Erudites, bags by halflings (presumeably weight reducing), and leather armor by wood elves and (I think) halflings.  If there was anything else I can't remember.<P>At the moment 115 is the max, and my suggested progression is:<P>Using spiderling/spider silks to get to 20-ish, then raw silk to 36.  Switch to cured silk (masks), since silk is far easier to find than mq pelts.  This will take you into the 80's, but you'll fail a lot at first.  You of course need to get brewing up to 60-ish to not fail at heady kiolas.<P>After cured silk, do quivers until 115.  I did reinforced leather, but that requires smithing & lots of running.  I'm at 104 now, haven't bothered recently, since I've been using all my HQ cat for leather padding  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Spider silk - best place I know of is Crag Spiders in EK.  They can drop as many as 6 at a time, and if you're 30+ you can mow through them quickly.  Carrion spiders in the area can also drop as many as 4.<P>For the lower level tailor, the dune tarantulas in NRo are probably your best bet.  The ones in WK are few & far between, and they and EC/WC spiders don't seem to drop many silks.<P>EK also seems to be one of the best places to auction for HQ pelts or silks.  <P>NK is pretty good to hunt for pelts too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I have a hard time believing that there is no tanner in the world.<P>I didn't say add a merchant with ALL the components.  But one who sold spider silk maybe?  Or LQ pelts?<P>Sheesh.  I thought I was making a logical request.  It is clear that this is an oversight.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>hehe.... not that your request is illogical... but you did it when you had more money than God.<P>Most people doing trades, are poor when they start.  I had 10-20 plats on average for the past few lvls... Got lucky sold 4 HQ Bear skins for 80 plats to someone that was Auctioning for it in EC Sunday.  But at lvl 11, half of that are for my spells at lvl 12.  So, I still don't have a fountain of resources.  What happens ?  Well, I try to buy as much as I can find... but I have to hunt quite a bit.<P>I looked into Neriak, and this is what I bought.<P>about 50 Spiderling Silk.<BR>6 Spider Silk<BR>3 Silk Swatches<BR>8 LQ Wolf Pelt/Skin.<P>I can't buy in East or West Commons, at least not yet as my Dark Elf Necro.  So I can't find all the goodies there.<P>So with patience, and some money there are alternative to hunting for some of these.  Well, I have to figure out a way to get to merchants in EC/WC before tomorrow... they will nuke inventory... darn.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>LOL.  I have more money than God?  <P>Sheesh.  I'm a necro, not a chanter.<P>I've just been playing for a year and a half.  PP just piles up after a while.<P>Besides, I tried working on mastering Tinkering and that took 20K pp in about an hour for 15 points increase.  Sigh.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm beginning to think I should write the Dark Race Guide to Tailoring here. Sheesh.<BR> <BR>Anyhow,modern Tailoring for the Newbie:<BR> <BR>First: Bash things. Get up a level or two.<BR>Second: Once you can flatten spiderlings safely,start doing so. Get a sewing kit(large is best). Make threads from spiderling silk,and threads into bandages. Scavenge any kills people leave for pelts or silk. Get a skinning knife and reduce the non-HQ ones(or any wolf pelt) to LQ and combine with silk threads for backings. Take some patterns along and make patchwork from ruined ones,or raw silk armors from swatches of spider silk if you're lucky to nail some. This'll get you into the low 30's max,31 is max for padding.<BR>Third: Learn to smith. Whack out toolboxes until you hit smithing 51(I believe),and start making yourself studs. These stack now,BTW. Now when you find MQ pelts,make studded instead of patchwork. This will get you up to tailoring 51.<BR>Fourth: Learn to brew a little. Heady Kiolas,namely. Use em to make cured silk masks out the wazoo. This'll get you to tailoring 82.<BR>Fifth: This is where every HQ pelt you scrounged up and saved come in. Make reinforced masks out of the HQ wolf,quivers from HQ cat,and backpacks from HQ bear. Packs sell for money to keep you skilling up. Reinforced takes you over 100,and quivers can max you out at 115+.<BR> <BR>I have more fun tailoring than I do with any other tradeskill. Any twink with a bucket of money can up the other stats until they get to the point where tailors are every day-having to forage for components. <BR> <BR>I hope more and more trade recipies require foraging,hunting for parts,and all the rest of the things that make players have to TRADE with each other for stuff that then gets made into things useful for all. I don't have to camp things to trade.<BR> <BR>Do I think some things are a little too tough? Yep. Maybe temper components shouldn't spawn so rarely-more like HQ pelts do. Jacinths and blue diamonds are insane mad tough to get one's hands on. But I don't think high end or even many middle end items should be off-the-vendor completely.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum8&number=8&thisthread=001810&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum8&number=8&thisthread=001810&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
