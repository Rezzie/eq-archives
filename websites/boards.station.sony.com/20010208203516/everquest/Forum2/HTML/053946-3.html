</FONT><HR>I still think it's funny when people think this person needs help...<P>We play this game, and get so caught up sometimes...  That we're getting all worked up when we Die, or have someone Kill Steal something we waited for hours...  We Scream, and B*tch...  We become Infuriated, pissed...<P>Now...  The above paragraph in no way generalize the population of EQ... but I'm sure there is at least 25% of the people that do react that way... So do they all need Help ?  Cause Emotions, are all about Crying...  Anger, Sadness, Laughter... And so on...  So if we get pissed, our Anger is way up there... as much as this woman's Sadness was way up there...  So she takes the game too seriously, be we don't ?<P>It's human nature....  When things happen out of our control, we're going to react one way or the other.  This hit her out of No-Where...  NO, SHE DIDN'T EXPECT IT... She never thought this was ever going to happen.  She probably didn't think she violated any policies.  Probably created that name on her first Character, not even thinking about policies...  She made a name for herself, everyone knew SHE was ManaGirl...  Now... she's not...  This is an Alternate reality for many... a place to put you're mind in, and forget all you're worries and problems...  God knows this is my relaxing part of the day (well, when I used to play more... hehe).  My wife used to get upset, cause I was so much into the game I wouldn't even hear her talk to me when she was next to me.<P>Yes... some people take this game farther then they should... some do it for Sanity's sake... God knows...  With 3 kids, borderline Bankrupt...  this Kept me out of Depression for a while... Is that wrong ?  Do I end up getting more into the game than others....  Well, sometimes I do.  Sometimes I calm down enough, were I realize I got too much into the game...<P>Who are WE to judge who should/shouldn't react in any way doing anything in their life.  Who died and many anyone King.  Rules ?  Well, I never read them...  And the majority of people probably haven't either... I just want to play the game.  I'll be nice, won't do anything bad to anyone... and I should be ok... Well... Managirl thought so... and it wasn't ok for that GM.  The fact that it violates 1 rule of EQ, does not mean he's not Anal.  Most GM's on all Servers are not going out of their way to change names, unless they are pretty bad... or you got caught causing trouble.  This GM...  Probably had nothing better to do...  Sad... After all the complaints we have that we can't find GM's to help us... this one goes and changes someone's name....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ohhhhh pull-lease, Another naming violation troll. Boy there is so  much here to comment on I dont know where to begin....<P>lets see....lets start with the obvious, your wife's in-game name, Managirl Beachbum.  Both names are clear violation of the naming policy.  Both names contain two words that make up a common phrase; therefore, against Verant's naming policy.<P>I know I know you should be able to name your charcater what you want. And to tell you the truth, I laugh my ass off when I see a funny name or a somewhat humorous name (My god they were able to get that through the naming system..good for them). However, I know it's just a matter of time before a GM/guide tells them to change it.  It is within their right.<P>Second, your are an ex-cyber cafe owner? Who cares, I guess the most important part of that is the "ex" part. I guess if you didnt spend all of your time playing EQ you may have been able to save your job/cafe/whatever.<P>Third, I empathize with your wife as using EQ as a distraction from real life, as I do the same thing. Nothing I like better than after the kids, the dogs, the wife, and the work is asleep/away than to kill a bunch orcs, frogloks, trolls, ogres, etc..you get the picture. It's a nice release. However, if she is going to bawl her eyes out because she got her name changed then maybe you need to seek some additional help for her since real life must be taking a heavy toll.<P>Further, if she likes the beach in Oasis so  much, why not take her to real one for awhile. Ever think of that one, skippy?<P>The last point, so you know alot of gamers because youre an ex-cyber cafe owner. So what?  Idle threats are made here all the time and the amount of "gamers" you know compared to the customer base is miniscule. So basically your blowing smoke up your own ass to make yourself feel good.<P>In conclusion, find your wife another diversion to EQ if she is getting that emotional about a name change. Geez.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>While I think GM's and guides need to be more consistent about applying the naming policy and picking a good new name can certainly take more time than 3 minutes, the naming policy exists for good reason, and it should not require a leap of faith that a name like "Managirl Beachbum" is hardly befitting a fantasy environment.<P>It's kind of like painting your house neon orange in America.

</FONT><HR>"EQ is not a substitute for real life."<P>Do you have hobbies? Have you ever had hobbies? Do you enjoy a good movie?<P>"Real life" includes diversion and relaxation, a break from the serious. EQ was her diversion, one she didn't practice as a religion from the sounds of it. From what Elem says, she used it as a healthy break from everyday stresses. <P>Everyone needs it, and what you chose to do for stress relief is personal.

</FONT><HR>Yes, he was rude and ignorant. <P>He was kicking someone when they are down which, to me anyway, is not playing fair. <P>However, the name could be seen in violation of rule #11 (it is "OR" not "AND"). Should it have been changed? I don't care either way. I've seen worse not get changed and I've watched others that I still don't see how they violated anything. Maybe I just don't read enough fantasy books or spend enough time trying to play "decipher the liscense plate" with peoples names to catch all the references. <P>As for whether or not this particular person should be crying, that is her business. If something like that happened to me about 2 weeks ago I might have lost it. Because I'm female? Nope. I lost a very loved, very much part of the family cat suddenly. This person that people are telling to get medicated or walk away may have had other outside influences that the original poster does not want or need to share with the rest of us. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>While I feel for you and your wife, Elementalist, you have to realize that both first and last names were in violation of the naming policy.  Both names are anachronistic and combinations of RL words.  While this is certainly true of other names that have not been changed, your wife got caught for some reason (probably a petition from another player) and was forced to change it.  It's suspiciously arbitrary how they enforce the policy, but the policy is still a good goal, IMO.<P>I agree in principle with the fact that there has to be some control on names in EQ as it is, nominally, a role playing game in a fantasy setting.  That being said, VI's handling of naming issues is half assed and capricious, which leads to hard feelings such as your wife experienced.  They've made the naming policy into a useful tool for the malicious to exact revenge on people.  Most clever people can come up with some reason that any name violates the policy and most GMs seem incapable of offering any coherent implementation of that policy.<P>My suggestion for VI would be that if they are really serious about names, have all names be submitted for review at the time of character creation.  At that time your name has a probationary status and is only finalized after a GM signs off on it.  Then your name is officially sanctioned and immune from being changed.  That would remove a lot of these hard feelings.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>JCDDreamer said:<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Do you know that "YourFriend" in Indian or in some other Language would be a VERY VALID Name<P>The word 'kurva' means nothing in English, that doesn't mean you can walk around in eastern Europe and say it freely without repurcussions. If you said 'bosmag' to a stranger in Atlanta, they would look at you funny. If you said it in Hungary, you would get a punch in the face.<BR>If you live in Chicago and you name your child 'Yourfriend', people would look at you like you were an idiot. Yet if you live in the jungle in Brazil and your tribe's interpretation for 'your friend' is an acceptable given name, it wouldn't be given a second thought.<BR>It's all about context. <BR>Managirl is not only a stupid name, it does, infact, violate the naming policy.<P>The context is a RPG played in English using classic 'fantasy' elements. Would you expect to see a knight in a fanatasy setting named 'Swordboy' or a wizard named 'Magicbuddy'?<BR>How about a enchanter named 'Mesmerizegirl'?<P><BR>Verant does not have 'name nazis' or 'name police' wandering around changing names that violate policy. The only way they will go out of their way to change a name is if someone petitions.<P>If I saw the name 'Managirl Beachbum' I would just laugh and think... 'heh, what a stupid name' and be on my way.... <BR>you gotta admit, that is a pretty damn stupid name.<P>My names may not be the most original, but they at least adhere to the naming policy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Akeezi (When I say You, I mean Everyone... not you specifically... making sure you don't feel targeted... hehe),<P>   Everyone is different...  I've seen a woman cry because a car broke down...  I got emotional myself last summer, when 1 of our 3 cats... my favorite dissapeared.  And yes, I'm a man.  This cat an I bounded...  big time.  Does that mean I need drugs ?  That I'm unstable... God forbid...  a Guy having tears in his eyes... hehe<P>   What are the chances that EQ was her outlet. Outlet from stress, and all that happens in Real Life.  And ManaGirl was her tool in EQ to get into a relax state, and be VERY social with others.  Get a reputation, be known as ManaGirl...  Everyone (or almost) knows you in a region (Oasis)... you go around chatting, helping people... saving their life... And get people saying... "Hey, it's Managirl... Heard a lot about you"... and you get into this relaxing alternate life a few times a week... do it for 8-10 months... and one day...  You're told you're name isn't going to be "ManaGirl"...<P>Is the topic really about Policy ?  Or about the fact that the GM was really Anal ?  As for the woman's reaction...  She built a reputation... made friends...  and for a moment... she felt despair and a great loss...  Can she get it back with her new name ?  Could she still get back into things as before...  That's not the issue...  That moment this happened, She felt hurt... and a loss... on something she invested on...   A hobby...  Something you though you had control on... but someone else Intruded into your hobby.<P>Everyone reacts different.  IT is very unfair for someone to think because they would react differently, someone else has problems.  I think some of the Most lvl Headed people in this world could react to some things surprisingly to others...  Doesn't change who they are.<P>These assumptions are what our kids suffers from... so easy to point fingers and say you're weird, unstable or something's wrong with you...  Where do we think our Kids gets it from ?  Why they turning out to be mean in General (Not all kids)...  We parents are supposed to show them how it's done... and we think we Know... when in reality...  We keep learning until we die... Life is a never ending learning experience...   So why think of others as Weak, weird or needing help... when a month from now...  You could be in a situation where you need help...  You want people to treat you that way....<P>I've lived my whole life treating people the way I wish I was treated...  And reading some comments here... I feel sad on how the world is turning out to be.  I get angry, and will probably get out of control too... and tell someone he's a total Morron, Stupid, Ignorant.. and so on...  But someone did get hurt, and people are mocking it...  That... is Sad.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Nah, you probably enjoy seeing some Troll or Ogre walking around with a name like Hooge Faattazz.

I can say that if I ever met some of the people that play this game, I would tell THEM to get a life.  It's sad to see that it's ok to sit on your ass day in and day out, playing almost 24/7, and then think that makes you better than everyone else.<P>Again, I will state to you that unless Verant requires their GM staff to abide by the same rules they have laid down for players, I can't see why they have the high ground in the argument.<P>Verant - "Well, WE made the game so we can do whatever the heck we want!  So THERE!"<P>Really nice way to treat a customer.  I'm beginning to see more & more how you have deviated from the motto "The customer is always right."<P>And before people lambaste me for getting down on Verant so much, need I remind you that they had a GM who went and death-bound people in VP, and then pretty much said to the people who died, "Well, this is all we can do.  So sorry you lost so damn much XP or stuff, but, hey, we're not at fault."<P>Sorry for the rant, we now return you to your regularly scheduled program, already in progress.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Yes...<P>"Dances with wolf" was the name given to the main character of movie... but the Indian name sounded totally different.  But it had meaning.  I'm talking about names that aren't Vulgar...  You just had to go there... hehe<P>Let's talk about Role playing, cause it seems you didn't really pay attention to that part.<P>	Got an Ogre, his name is "YourFriend"  Well, let's think Role playing perspective.  Ogres & Trolls are Dumb.  And you've got an Ogre with a soft spot, wanting to speak common... that keeps telling others "Me Your Friend" to make sure he wants no harm to them... and after a while Others start calling him "YourFriend" cause he's always refering himself as that.  I'm cutting down story lines and all... but this is called ROLE PLAYING.<P>Now... if people could stop comparing Real Life with EQ... Cause EQ... IS NOT Real life.  EQ Is a fantasy game...  Ogres can have a common name that comes from a given NickName...  If you've played AD&D anytime in your life...  You'd see that this is possible.  And it was the point I was trying to make.<P>I'm not talking about Dirty words and all... But Compound names should be allowed if it's in good taste.  and ManaGirl was nothing to worry about.<P>Did you know I was refused my surname "Qron'us" cause it SOUNDS like a Klingon planet in Start Trek....  I don't watch That show, and could care less...  But hey, seems like the GM decided to use his Vast Knowlege of Star Trek in EQ for some reason...<P>Verant is going too far on the Rules...  Those rules are too strick.  Compound names in good taste should be allowed.  Some names don't make sense...  But in AD&D, I can see a woman Adventurer wanting a NickName of "ManaGirl"... and everyone would refer her as that...  Why would the DM have a problem with that ?<P>The GM was Anal Retentive... and those that keep going back and saying... Well it's in Rule #11... you show that you don't know any better.  The rules are ridiculous... not the people that have violated them without knowing.  I never read the rules... I'm playing to have fun, never in my life did I think that a characters name was so much to fuss about.  The Vulgar, and Absurb names need to be taken care off... some of the names they are changing are fine... they have no reason to go so far.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Zel - I have to disagree with your opinion completely.  You said it yourself, this is a fantasy RPG and not RL.  Yet you use a RL comparison.<P>What's wrong with a goofy name for a person that RP's a goofy character?  Same lines as someone with a 'dark' name RPing an evil character.<P>Pookie Blookie would be a silly name.  Put it on a gnome mage that seems to think he's actually a rogue that can cast spells and constantly tries picking peoples pockets although he doesn't have the skill..... it's funny!  Well, maybe not to everyone, but if that's how they wanna RP it then so be it.  It adds content and takes away from dryness.<P><BR>To the poster-<P>I'm sorry to hear what happened to your wife.  I can understand yours and hers feelings.  I don't necessarilly agree with the naming policy, but you can't blame the guide or GM that enforced the rules.  They are only carrying out that which they are told to do.  I don't think any of them actually enjoy taking peoples names away.  As a matter of fact, I know the person (in game) that is the 'name police' among other things.  She has changed friends names right before my eyes.  Actually she even made me change my last name!  (which I was happy about though heh)  On the outside and in tells, she is very professional and carrying out her job as she has been instructed.<P>On the inside, she feels horrible for having to take away some peoples names.  The people who have really attatched themselves to the names and built a reputation around it.  But the fact is, if she didn't change it, someone else would.  And if she 'looked the other way', you may have your name a little longer, but she would lose her job and privaledges in the end.<P>Don't blame the guides or GM's.  Instead, try and address a discussion about the naming policy and see if you can get it amended.  These boards would be a great place to start since they are constantly monitored.<P>I for one, would support change to the naming policy.  I think it needs to be looked at.  No, I don't want to see anything offensive or detracting from the game like 'Idiesomuchitsucks'.  But Managirl doesn't offend me and I think it's quite in content with the game.<P>With the current policy is Managurl acceptable?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Elementalist-<BR>sorry to hear about that.  First off, its Verant, not Variant.  Second, if you read the naming policy, your wifes name, was, in fact, in violation of the policy.  While the policy is oftentimes trite and unenforced, it does exist, and the GM was correct.  The fact that it was changed to Matemp was only to give her a placeholding name until she could think of one herself.  There was no maliciousness on the part of the GM, he was just doing his job.  The fact that it emotionally upset your wife is unfortunate, but neither the GM nor Verant is at fault..technically, your wife is, for not  reading the naming policy prior to creating her character.<P>Personally, I like(d) your wifes name...nothing wrong with it at all, except you can't have a name comprised of 2 words.  You could have simply changed the spelling to Managyrl or some such and been fine.  Getting all bent out of shape isn't going to change a thing.  Having a few players gripe about the naming policy isn't going to do a thing...people have been complaining about the policy and its arbitrary enforcement for over a year.  If you really want to make a stink about it, send Verant a letter.  Personally they are not uniformly enforcing the naming policy,  when they most certainly have the means to do so.  That is what I would be complaining about.  But I read all the policies and conventions before I created my characters.<P>Akherat</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR># This is supposed to be another world, in a fantasy setting. Verant doesn't want people naming characters after real life things, or use their names to be descriptive. Would you name your child "Twelvevoltman"? (yes that was a name I saw once) Verant wants the names to stay within this fantasy setting. #<P>Then they should allow inoffensive "phrase names".<P>You ask if someone would name their child "Twelvevoltman".  Yes, many would.  Not that specifically, perhaps, but consider how many American Indian names are phrases:  "Running Bear", "Sitting Bull", or the movie popularized "Dances With Wolves".<P>I find those sorts of names to be FAR more "staying within a fantasy setting" than "Gonaber", "Velkrab", or "Gruntt".<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is a really silly reason to leave the game, but if that's how sensitive you both are, whatever.  I had my name changed at lvl 23 and I wasn't happy about it but I understood that it went against the naming policy after the GM explained it to me.  Your wife needs to get a grip, take a break from the game for a day or two and then come up with a new, clever name.  If she can't do that, then she probably shouldn't be playing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>DotMaster is cool.... ManaGirl I think sounds cute.  Well that's my opinion.<P>Please re-read the Roleplaying paragraph... over... and over again...<P>A stupid ogre present himself to everyone as "Me Your Friend"... he barely understand any common... So when Humans ask him, his name... and he didn't understand at first... he'd answer "Me Your Friend"...   Well, the Human feeling like he's was just a big Jolly Ogre, and not as bas as most.... decided to Trust him at some extant... Well, since they didn't know his name... they decided to call him "YourFriend"... for comical relief cause that's all he kept saying "Me Your Friend".<P>Now, I played AD&D... and the names made sense... but NickNames are also something you pick up in AD&D.  You're nick picking the Rule, and making it so anything else don't count.  In Roleplaying, you could have a name that doesn't follow the regular rules...<P>A troll that lives near a Gnome village... and kills Gnomes week after week... could have a NickName of "Gnome Killer"...  And maybe the Troll would like the sound of that...  Does the name sound Stupid ?  To you it does.  To the Gnome it makes them tremble... To the Troll ?  He chuckles and repeats the name and thinks...  I like it...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Role playing is just that... Roleplaying... You put too many rules, you're not giving a chance for roleplaying.<P>Names like UStupid, Iloveu...  Might not exactly make sense in the game...  But You never know... If you role play things right... there might be a reason behind a name, which no one else can comprehend until they know the whole story... That... is the fun part of REAL Roleplaying...<P>I'm not saying some names shouldn't be changed, and some are not an Abuse of just having weird names... but there should be a bit more freedom than they have been given us.  If you don't cause any trouble, and you don't bother anyone...  they shouldn't be coming after you like you just murdered someone and put you on the spot.<P>Bah... it's just my opinion... and people here just stick to Rule 11... and can't see past it.  What-ever.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am so glad some people started posting that crying is not necessarily inappropriate.  After all, we all invest a great deal of time into this "world", so her reaction was tears rather than screaming & cursing, that doesn't make it wrong.<P>As to the name - I would like to know EXACTLY which naming policy was broken.  From my point if view it skirted close to some, but I don't think its clear what the Guide was thinking.<P>Yes its anachronistic, but so are 20% of the names in use it seems, I can't believe that was the reason.  Trademarks - could the guide have thought Verant invented "mana"?  I hope not, but you never know.  This leaves the compound/sentence rule.  Well, there are alot of compound names out there, I honestly can't believe a guide would single this one out even if it was petitioned.  Sentence though - Maybe some fool read it as "Man A Girl Beach Bum".  That's the only way I can see a clear violation.  I would ask if "Mannagirl" was acceptable - although there you might run into the religious issue (remember Exodus?)  OK - so try Manaagirl - not as pretty, but it might work.<P>I still think its wrong.  There is a name on Lanys that I find highly offensive - but I didn't meet the character until L49ish, I would never consider petitioning.  I've grouped with her & she's quite nice in fact, I just try to ignore that this big Barbarian woman goes by the name Pubeces...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hey Thinking about this..<P>My 19th High Elf Cleric (Soulsavor) which I'm about to delete when my new Cleric reaches him, he's lvl 5 Dwarf (Danodar)...  My name has been violating the policy since I started... 6 months now.<P>I've talked to about 2 if not 3 GM's and as many if not more Guids.  Was in ErudsCrossing, and there were 3 GM's/Guides meeting there... I went to talk to them, and chatted... asked them what they were doing...  They responded to me by my name...  I never heard anything about violating the policy ?<P>But again... I was told on my server, that they won't enforce it unless you're a trouble maker... or until a new Guide comes on and he wants to be a jerk.  It's been fine... I think every server follows those rule differently.<P>No matter how stupid a name is to someone, if the person chosen it likes it... that's all that counts.  If I like "Soulsavor" why would I can if 5 or 10 people said it was a "STUPID" name...  Hey, it's my char... I have to live with it... It's just funny that some people put down the name thinking it even matters they think so... hehe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
