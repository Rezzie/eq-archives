</FONT><HR>Absor, you have committed a grave wrong against many of the more serious posters on the mage "summoned item" thread, and perhaps several others as well.<P>At the start of the summoned item thread, you asked that we list ideas for summoned items.  That's all you were looking for, and you made that very clear.  Despite the fact that several people took it as a chance to vent about every problem about the class, several of us kept our posts to the topic you had asked for.<P>Those of us keeping to the topic have been waiting for our promised "Mage Talk" thread to give our views on the rest of the class issues.  What was our reward for trying to give you what you had asked for?  Finding out (thanks to yet ANOTHER off topic post in that thread) that you were using that thread as a substitute for an official class disscussion.  I didn't really believe it till I searched for the thread that they talked about, and read this.<P>I (and at least a few other mages I know) have been thinking about what we wanted to say when the long awaited post started.  Thanks to you, we allmost missed our chance to be heard.  Only those that drifted away from the topic you had asked for would have been listened to on several important issues about the mage class.  I pity any other players whos favorite class had a "stealth thread" done on it without them realizing.  They may have missed out on the chance to make any good arguments they had on the topics.  At least I lucked out in that area.<P>Now, if you will excuse me, I need to go add my voice to those that derailed the topic of the mage thread.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor:<P>I, for one, really enjoy these threads and think they'll be good for the game.  A nice way to get a bit of input that could even out a few of the imbalances in the game.  I'm definately looking forward to the enchanter one... the trick of making the enchanter class fun in SoV when they are already on the high end of the power spectrum just due to buffs... well, that'll be interesting.<P>As for the opinions bit, I do see a few problems with it.  For instance, your druid/shaman healing recommendations (remedy/divine light) won't solve the fact that these classes are useless against boss mobs, in terms of healing.  I think that's the type of thing that sort of upsets people.  The thought that you'll only suggest that which you think has value (as opposed to ideas that you feel have merit, logically, even if you personally don't agree with them).  It's a subtle difference of being a filter for bad ideas and being a filter for what you deem as being how it should be.  I think that is where people's concerns are coming from.  Basically, on the lists, if you threw out a few different options to solve a problem, like the best 2 or 3... then people would not worry so much about it being personal views.  I think it also has a bit more merit as you lack experience in the high level game and are therefore relying mostly upon what people tell you.<P>Anyway, overall, good job.<P>Hopefully once classes are done (and you give yourself a bit of a breather), we can hop into tradeskills, as this is an area that could also use some work and I'm sure the smiths and we tinkerers would love to have someone to actually discuss our issues with.  Yak is a bit on the silent side <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Keep up the good work.<P>Axterix En'Obelix<BR>Level 59 Enchanter<BR>Master Tinkerer<BR>The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Something else to be brought up about this whole class balancing and lockdown idea:<P>As Brad and Absor have said in other threads, EQ is a dynamic environment.  Change is inevitable.  There are a couple new zones promised (i.e. the Warrens and Stoneback Mountains (?)).  What was good design two years ago might now be seen as needing a change. Etc., etc.<P>Why then this foreshadowed deadline of freezing class capabilities and improvements?<P>If the game is dynamic, and people are still willing to pay monthly for it, then why shouldn't Verant keep employees allocated to keeping things up-to-date and running smoothly?<P>The talk so far from Verant makes it sound like other than database corrections, EQ will be stagnant from then on.<P>Even text based MUDs can keep players interested for more than a year or two.  Is EQ really going to look that bad compared to what's coming out in the next few months?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor said:<BR>Some have suggested that I should start these threads in the class specific boards. Well, perhaps I should have. But I don't want it to seem like I only want opinions from people that play the class being discussed. I actually want input from anyone that has ideas. &lt;end&gt;<P>For the sake of better filing and being able to find an article, or a discussion, I do think that it is time that you split your board up into classes. It is really bad when it takes 5 to 6 pages just to go through the regular whineplay board and then hope to say something constructive.<P>It would also make sense, and allow you to create an admin post at the top of some threads, so you can say things, and point the direction of the thread. What this will do, is cut down the traffic on the generic areas, and change the way people think. It might make a "hybrid" discussion less attractive, but I rarely find that anything I say about my Bard (a hybrid), makes me any kind of an expert on the other hybrids. When one reads the hybrid threads, one can also find this in action quite often.<P>The other issue I have with whineplay, is that there are way too many topics that repeat time and again. If whineplay was down to minimal, and all it had left were 5 video card topics, I don't think that another player would create a new topic ... see?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Because of this, no animal will ever attack him unless first attacked by the Druid. They are spellcasters whose focus is all things natural, allowing them to call upon nature for aid. They share some woodland skills with their Ranger brothers.<P>The Cleric is a holy man endowed by his patron deity with the power to heal, and, to a lesser extent, call upon the wrath of his deity to smite his foes. Prayer is how the Cleric gains his ability.<P>Shaman<BR>They are similar to the Cleric, but are more of a tribal witch doctor and are typically found amongst the more primitve races. Their primary focus is largely healing and other Clerical type spells, but they also have a good deal of offensive spells<P>Never once does it say anything about a Druid being a healer, whereas the Shamans class specifically states "Their primary focus is largely healing and other Clerical type spells."  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi Absor,<BR>Maybe I missed it, but where is the mage thread?  Is it the one about mages and summoning?  Because just talking summoning is not dicussing the entire class balance issue.  Or do you feel, like necromancers, that from the many recent magician threads that you have a good grasp of their problems?  If this is so, then I'm concerned.  I have conciously avoided posting to these threads because most have struck me as turning into whines.  These threads have also received very few positive replies from a VI representative, so I have avoided them.  If a single coherent, "let's talk mages" thread had been posted by you then I may have offered some suggestions (at leaast one of which has not been suggested by anyone to the best of my knowledge).<P>At the very least Absor, it would be nice to have a posted summary where we could verify points you may have missed.<P>Thanks for you time and keep up the good work.<P>Sincerely,<BR>Morynn Starspear<BR>Clan Jax, Prexus<BR>51 Magician</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Look A Great Idea: To remedy the downtime of casters and non-casters is they med or sit. If I am a caster completely out of mana I sit for 15 mins to regain my mana to full. Why while medding have what is called a trance state take over a period of time. The longer I med ie the faster my mana will start regening. the closer to full I get without moving, standing or casting the faster mana fills up the bar. Near the end of medding last bubb or so the mana could be regenning at 4 times the normal rate. However if I move get hit cast the trance state must be restarted. Also with non casters who are sitting to regen hps The longer a tank sits the faster he starts regenning hps after about 5 mins of sitting his hps should be recovering at double normal rate, until he moves. You can call this type of sitting relax ). the more relaxed ie not moving the person is for periods of time the faster his body start mending, once near four bubbs of health the person can be regenning hps at near 6 times normal rate.  These processes could work for all classes and shorten the downtime in groups and solo for casters and for non casters. So here is your great idea ) use it .  Btw I am most happy with the game. I enjoy it in its current form as well as when I first started playing. The constant improvments are just gravy to me ).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Shamans have been literally ignored since the beginning days, and one thread with coupld of points does not help anything.<P>In all the threads about shamans, they have been asking to make their spells more useful, especially post lvl 50. Shamans have been also asking to stop giving out shaman specific spells out to other classes! Yes this goes on and now clerics are demanding yet another shaman only spell?? Shamans might as well demand then many cleric specific spells.<P>Don't count that this little thread you once had was all what shamans had to say out there. It was not enoug. Shamans have been ignored since the day one this game started, and is literally "dying" class in EQ.<P>We don't want anything "uber" or special or spells from other classes.

I actually believed that many of the issues would actually be given some time and thought and heck, even a response (other than the original one).  Its sad to see you give us a 1 lvl pet upgrade (with decreased damage of course) and call it a day.  I've also heard that we may get some of the clerics healing spells.  Thats great for us (sorry Clerics  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">) but for the love of Peete, FIX THE CURRENT PROBLEMS TOO.  <P>Also, it doesnt help our confidence when your pet enhancement wasnt noticed for 5 days after the patch for two reasons.  One, you didn't know about it, and two, it was really a nerf.  And its scary that you didnt even know what the patch was going to do (oh, the damage went down????).  If i were you, i might talk to the people making the changes so as to keep us better informed. <P>Oh well, just another disappointment.  Don't sweat over it Absor.

</FONT><HR>I just wanted to talk about balance.<P>Most people who are above 50 realize that raids and uber mobs are what this game is all about.  In the end, THAT is what needs to be balanced.  The levels before can be unblanced somewhat at different levels but the end must be balanced.<P>You can't have a class that is great in the beginning then horrible at the end.  That is not balance that is a road to nowhere. The melee disciplines are extremely unbalancing in this respect.  Uber mobs with a billion hit points disturb the balance of mana based damage and "free" melee damage.<P>I really think that all classes need "disciplines" that make them as effective as a warrior in the end.  Give hybrids the same disciplines and double or triple the resuse time.  That would keep normal play balanced but let the hybrids unleash the same amount of power in an uber encounter.<P>Wizards need % of hp spells to combat the uber sov mobs.  1.8% would make it do 600 ish damage to a 32k mob but more to a velious uber mob so as to not throw off the balance.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I have, however, been involved in very intense threads about these classes, and I feel I have enough information on them to build a good list.  I am NOT talking about the summoned items thing, nor exclusively about the necros on raids thread (though that one was certainly important).  There were several threads (probably long gone from these boards by now), and I gathered information from them.  They were the threads that inspired me to start these class threads.  I will not be starting necromancer or magician talk threads until I am done with the others.  We can continue those discussions when I post my lists later.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bump.<BR>Why does the 59 Necro pet consume a peridot, and why is the spell itself so freaking rare?<BR>Related to class balance...<P>Are the epic quests supposed to be balanced? If so, they arent, neither in terms of difficulty or usefulness. If they arent supposed to be balanced, what was the thinking behind that?<P>It seems to me that 3 of the most useful items, are also the 3 easiest to obtain. While others, like the Necro and Druid quests are pretty hard, and the rewards crappy, relative to the other epic items.<P>Sayleth<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
