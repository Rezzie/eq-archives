</FONT><HR>Well, the problem with some things on that list is they're race specific. Iksar-only necro stuff, flayed skin is only for humans and erudites. I don't believe any of the class-specific items for the other pure casters are race-specific. If you were to do the list just for, say, a gnome or dark elf necro, it'd be a bit shorter for them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Leave out the veeshan's peak stuff.<P>Most players won't ever see Veeshan's peak.  Stuff from there doesn't belong.  That'll make the list better.<P>Second, there are also items out there that anyone can use.  Some of those are more useful for some classes than others.  Sarnak Arcane Fetish, for instance, may not be enchanter only... but only enchanters will wear it for the most part.<P>That's what really matters in the end.  The amount of actual useful stuff.  And in that regards, the int casters get hosed for sure.  They couldn't think of what we want.  Still, there is hope.  Perhaps they'll spice up the drops in chardok a bit with some nifty class specific caster gear (and monk too) that casts spells, just so that we won't feel left out.<P>Then we can argue about how useless the spells are like all the other classes <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>A few questions about the many new necro items since I play a ranger and a cleric and thus am not familiar with necro equipment.  How many of the "new" necro items from kunark are iksar only?  How many of those items are BETTER than current Norrath proper items?  What is the level at which can they be gotten?  Iksars (I think) can't wear Golden Chitin Bracers because (I think) they are plate-looking, so are they getting comparable bracers?  <P>Why do I ask these questions?  Because of all the robe casters, the only ones that Iksar can be are the necros.  It is my understanding that Kunark was released with the goal that if an Iksar never wanted to leave Kunark the player could actually do all his leveling and gather all his equipment in there with no need to go to Norrath proper.  Do these items exist just to achieve this goal for Iksar necro's or are there really TOO many necro items in Kunark?  I'd like to know the answers to these questions if anyone can help.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Can we stop this "Abashi favor's necros" bs?  It's childish to assume that because I play one that I would drive the enhancement of the class.  You guys want people here who play the game, but when we do, you assume that there's some class favoritism going on.<P>Shortly after I got here everyone was screaming about how "Brad plays a Ranger" and how they were the "favored" class.  <P>I'm lucky if I can play my necro 4 hours in a week these days.  I've made 4 levels in the past 9 months.  I'll never see 60th level as I'm not in it to level these days.  I have only one necro-specific item and it isn't even on that list (Harvester).  I've refused to consult on most issues related to the necromancer in house (except for nerfs, which I've usually been the driving force behind).  I don't really plan to go after any of these items on the list, and I told the game designer who's working on some really high end quests for all of the classes that I wasn't interested in helping with the necromancer one.<P>What could have been a good discussion fades into yet another thread about how we must have some deviant plan to hurt your class or favor ours.  We don't play the game on "god mode", create items out of thin air for our characters, or run around trying to slip through enhancements for our classes.  <P>Please stop posting this garbage.<P>-Gordon<P>P.S.

</FONT><HR>Mr. Abashi, the question still remains. The comments about your class are just an attempt to understand why Necromancers have so many advantages not only in the core functionality of their class, but in item selection as well. You have stated that the staff is at a loss for ideas of equipment for casters (I'll give you some ideas sometime, btw). From the standpoint of the Enchanters, Wizards and Magicians, Verant hasn't even tried. We'd like some more class-specific items too.

</FONT><HR>Abashi, you know you seem very defensive about this Necro favor thread that runs through posts and people's conversation, but even you have to admit it is an easy conclusion to draw.<P>How many posts about AE Rain spells did it take before you responded?  And the response was "they work like they are supposed to, oops it hits pets, that isn't good, this is closed."<P>Some guy posts "Necromancers should get teleports" and you are on it like white on rice.<P>NEcromancers have more class specific items by a gross margin than the other INT casters, and start out and continue to be more powerful and varied in spells than the others, even more than Enchanters.  They have nicer LOOKING gear, something everyone likes for themselves.  Now... of all the new stuff that is added, how much do you think people will smile and put up with before they start to complain?<P>The way you respond and behave, coupled with Verants APPARENT fixation and favoritism for the class over others plus your playing a Necro really does lend to a quick suspicion, if not conclusion.<P>So how do you fix this?  Your choices are to post on here defensively and angrily about how its not true... or to do something IN THE GAME about this lopsided approach, and on the board.<P>Your choice, bro.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Something which hasn't really been discussed in this thread is whether class specific stuff is a good thing. My limited experience with Kunark is that there is some very specific items (Hammer? of Flattening SK/WAR BAR/OGR/TRL 2HB) comes to mind. I don't imagine that a lot of these items are being traded because at least in this item's case it's extremely specific and not likely to be very useful. This is admittedly not a typical example, but I think that it illustrates a point: class/race restrictions on items lower an item's value. <P>To my mind class/race specific items compare to more general items as follows:<BR>A. Specific items are worth less than more general use items because,<BR>B. Trading in these items is to a smaller market, (i.e. only 1 class/race combo rather than all int casters of all races). Microeconomics - less demand due to smaller market = lower price. <P>So to my mind maybe as an enchanter I would like more ENC specific items becuase they'd likely be cheaper than the equiv. ENC/WIZ/MAG/NEC item (I'd only be bidding against other ENC rather than all casters). Drawback being that resale would be a bigger pain after the fact and a fracturing of items into class/race specific types complicates trading significantly. I'm not into the whole trading thing personally. I'd be curious to hear from those who are what there experiences are with class specific items like the Robe of Foci versus general INT caster items.<P>I don't really mind items being shared by ENC/WIZ/MAG. As an enchanter I'd biased towards an INT/CHA item which would likely be a much lower priority of other casters. I don't see the need to have them restricted though.<P>Just wanted to raise the issue of the desirability of this sort of change to class-specific items. BTW, Robe of the Foci gets a thumbs down from me as an Enchanter item: where's the CHA bonus? I'm trying to increase that stat right now, so I'm biased.<P>Another observation is that I think we'd all like greater variability in appearance of our characters. Wearing robes given the way EQ renders characters pretty much leaves most of our appearance up to a single item. So, yes I'd like to wear something other than an FBR that a ton of other people have. However it seems from previous discussions, Abashi has indicated that there is a pretty limited capacity for different styles of robes given colors and tints, etc. <P>So, in conclusion (ramble, ramble) I think that it's unclear if class specific stuff is a great idea. I'd guess part of the reason why necros have so much stuff is that the whole evil, raise the dead thing lends itself to a whole bunch of themed items, and frankly the other Int casters tend to be lumped together (share guild space in cities, etc. etc.) and aren't as distinguishable in temperment. (I'm sure that comment's going to annoy a bunch of people.) <P>Just my 2cp.<P>Aeloryn 31 Enchanter<BR>Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I want to clarity a few things before this thread degenerates anymore.<P>First thing:  I made a mistake in my origional post and I failed to mention Kunark item drops.<P>Second Off: I would like to appoligize Gordon for saying that you are creating favoritism towards necromancers.  I am only trying to point out the lact of class specific items for Magicians, Enchanters and Wizards.<P>Third Off:  I realize that I have missed some items from the list.  But I feel that it is quite clear there are many more necromancer items compaired to Magicians, Enchanters, and Wizards.<P>Fourth thing:  Yes, not all of these items are good.  But there still necromancer only, this is the point I am trying to get across.  I noticed a level 53 necromancer mentioned alot of the items are "junk", but really.. if you were level 30ish would you find alot of these items decent?<P>Fifth thing: Yes, Flayed Skin is not necromancer only BUT it is shared with there sister class Shadowknight.  In essence it is a necromancer only item.  Also some are race specific, but there still a necromancer only item.<P><BR>I hope this clarifies a few issuse people are noticing.
