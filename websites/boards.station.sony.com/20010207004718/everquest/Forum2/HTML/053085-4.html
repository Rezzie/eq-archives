&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor, some responses:<P>1) Please don't do something like add criticals to throwing shuris and think this "improves" our damage.  It does not in any way.  We use shurikens *IF* we are pulling (which in velious most of the time we are not) 1 time.  That doesn't increase our damage.  Its a cosmetic change.<P>2) Monks have always been proclaimed as the "masters of melee" by Verant.  Now in almost all cases, they are 3rd, which makes us less than desirable in the high level game, when our damage output is far exceeded by rogues, and fairly easily exceeded by reasonably equipped warriors too.  They can easily (mind you this is talking about high level (55-60) warriors in good guilds) get weapons that make our epics look like cheese puffs.  If we are to be the masters of melee we must have a way to keep up, which means at least put us somewhere in between.  <P>3) You noted our epic being "too easy" and you noted the epic effect "bug" as something to put on the list.  Our epic, in my opinion, is not too easy.  Just because it is *possible* to kill a level 61 monster with 27k hps to get the Robe of the Lost Circle, does not negate the hundreds of hours most players spend camping all of the stuff needed to just start the epic quest.  The Monk epic requires us to kill 6 monsters level 55-63 and complete 2 quests (RoTLC + RoTWF) that require 200-250 hours of camping generally.  That to me doesn't seem to easy.  One thing you left off your response list is the fact that the damage change the Celestial Fists gives which turns our fists into 9/16 weapons is rather meak when compared to the readily avaiable weapons out there.  There are plenty of 10/18, 11/19, 13/20 weps appearing in dragon necropolis, western wastes, and now sleepers tomb.  If our epic item is to be epic, we should at least compete with this stuff.  Jade Maces are fairly commonplace nowadays and at 9/18 are nearly as good as our *epic* item.  <P>4) Triple Attack:  This is not necessary.  By increasing the fist ratio (a fact you put on the list, thanks!), there is no need to add a "triple attack" skill.  Its a fluff skill which doesn't provide much as proven in many many logs.<P>5)I don't see a problem with "too many weapons or armors" that one player mentioned.  I personally think monks have too few items.  There always is room for more variety.  My problem is that at level 53, if I don't wear my Robe of the Whistling Fists, I look like a newbie.  Make some more textures for Monks.  Cured Silk = Crescent = Shiverjunk = Silver Garbage = Black Pantherjunk etc.  You noted the looks, so hopefully something cool can be done  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>6) Shiverjunk was put on your list.  Applauds for this.  A lot of it just isn't used.  The legs for example have 5ac, 5agi and 5 *wisdom*?? with 7 svfire.  The only time these ever go on my legs is if i need Fire resistance.  Otherwise i use any one of dozens of better items.  <P><BR>I think what most monks want (or at least most monks in the 51-60 level range) want is some redeeming qualities in the end game.  The end game has become a very narrow field as of late because of changes in Velious.  There are no reasons to pick a monk over a rogue or warrior, because the monk brings nothing to a group anymore.  There are a lot of "cosmetic" changes, as i call them, that could be implemented, but the real meat of the problem lies in feign death, and damage (both epic and otherwise), in that we no longer "fit".<P>I think the majority of the balance issues that need addressing are in the end game..the 51-60 game.  Monks were very well balanced before RoK and SoV when it was just a 1-50 game.  It is 51-60 where we fall behind, and eventually dropped from the end game.<P> Zadkiel sums things up very well, as do a lot of the other high level monks from other servers (arlos, carissa, derra, denzalo (and i hope myself) all come to mind immediately).  Please hear us  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Cymorg<BR>Whistling Fist of Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alright my second post...<P>I see a lot of posts here suggesting an improvement to the fist damage/ratio.  Some of these are just lucicrous though.  16/18?  Though I agree that our fists should be a bit more competitive, THEY SHOULD NOT OVERSHADOW EVERY UBER-RARE DROP WEAPON IN THE GAME.  And this seems to be what a lot of people are suggesting.<P>I am somewhat against drastic modifications to fists, and I instead think that our damage advantage should be increased via our special attacks.  As far as I'm concerned, sure, the best weapons in the game maybe should belong to warriors.  And yes maybe they should have better ratio than our fists, considering they can be rare and difficult to come by.  Why steal the limelight from your friend's 14/24 weapon he worked months to get by laughing in his face with a (ridiculous) 16/18 or better, free fist?<P><BR>We need to regain our damage advantage, but do it through the special attacks.  Vs. backstab, crits, crips, aggressive, weapon procs, etc, in it's current state a lone flying kick is no comparison, considering it's long recycle time, low minimum damage and frequent misses.<P>Heck actually to tell you the truth, monk combat is bland..actually BORING in it's current state.  Crush, crush, kick.  Crush crush, kick for 3.  It is actually more exciting to watch for the crit, crip, procs,  trip attacks, berserkers, assassinates and stunning kicks of my warrior/rogue friends than my own repetitive, flavourless spam.<P>I'd like to suggest adding a new special attack..perhaps at level 40, or 45...something like 'flurry'.  Same recycle time as FK, but it triggers all of your specials at once..from flying kick all the way down to round kick, with separate hit rolls for each.  This could be relatively easy to implement, and would probably add a decent yet not overpowering amount to the monks damage output.  And heck would it ever be fun!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Celestial Fist Quest too easy?<P>Nooooo!<BR>----------------------------------------------<BR>MoorGhost bravely stated:<BR>&gt;"8) Epic quest is too easy. This may not be a popular opinion, but it is true. The Robe of the Lost Circle is obtainable by killing the quest NPC's (please change this). Headbands and sashes can be traded instead of quested for. The Robe of the Whistling Fists can be multi-quested. Once the last robe is obtained, three groups can do all four of the battles needed to get the fists, and none of the mobs are rare spawns. In theory, you only need to camp two components - the pipes for the RotWF - the rest can be purchased or killed for. Our epic weapon should mean more than that."&lt;<P>Absor Wrote:<BR>Thanks for saying that. I appreciate it. And, well, it will end up on the list.<BR>------------------------------------------------<P>Ugh!<P>What this really states is the getting the ROTLC is too easy.  Especially if Zephyl drops it every time.<P>Getting the ROTLC may be easy for some (amassing an army to kill Zephyl), but for 99% of the monks out there who got theirs by 'Questing', this is thought is just plain scary.<P>I personally have been doing this 'chain' quest since level 1 and am working on the ROTWF.  <P>My suggestion is to simply REMOVE the Robe from Zephyl's drop table.<P>But really? How many monks are actually obtaining their robe this way?  Not many, and if they do, the tactic is to hand Zephyl torches or junk to reduce his effectiveness.<P>And here we all thought that the Epic Quest was made relatively painless due to all of the mindless quest camping we've had to do since birth.  How many other classes have quests this involved or dependent on previous quest items (the sash/headband chain quests, the Raster camp, the Targin camp, the Qwinn camp!)?<P>Don't change this mid stream for those of us out there who are working diligently to complete the quest.  I got my ROTLC the proper way and will still need to gather forces to finish the quest once I approach the Elements.<P>The break in the link is Zephyl.<P>~Ezhar<BR>54 Disciple, Karana<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>About the epic quest...<P>No other class starts it's epic quest at level one. Honestly, this complaint is baseless.<P>The monk community that I know (I lurk on both the major monk boards) are honorable. Their code is to complete quests themselves. One of the worst camps in the game is needed for the Robe of the Lost Circle. Raster in Lower Guk... I hear stories of people spending well over 100 hours waiting for him.<P>As to the complaint that quests can be multi-ed... any quest involving more than one item can be multi'ed... that's inherant to the code - and this includes the Robe of the Whistling Fists.<P>The only post I've read in this thread was Absor's reply. I'm a casual gamer who has played a monk since April 1999 - I'm only level 35, so there's lots I don't know about this game. But to say that the monk epic is too easy, after all monks have to go through to get to the point of being able to attempt it, that's just cruel.<P>Just my 2 coppers... Good luck Absor - rather you than me  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, <P>I would really like a discussion about what the role of a monk is.  Why did splitting spanws be taken away from the monk (feign pulling) and given to the shadowknite and rogue.  The shadownight can darkness, causing one mob to return to their spawn point slower than the rest. Combined with feign, they can do an even better job at it than monks used to be able to do.<P>The rogue has reduced aggro when they sneak. They can effectivly use that to pull one mob out of a group if htey know the pathing.  <P>If these tequniques exist, why was it so detrimental to the game that the monk feign pull?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>here's a gret idea: Meditate<BR>Uses of meditate can either be these 2 things:<BR>1)poison/disease/etc...<BR>2)Increase attack (then once you stop meditating it will go down slowly)<P>Other ideas:<BR>1)minimum Flying kick dmg.  3dmg on flying kick is very pathetic.<P>2)Grapple.  Essentially it reduces the AC of the target by a ton, say from 1000 to 500 or something. The downside is that while the monk is using it, they cannot attack, and if the mob breaks the grapple the monk is stunned for a number of rounds. So it would be sort of dangerous, but it could be used to help the group tear down another mob. (got this idea from monkly-business. not my own idea but i love it)<P>3)Velous pulling needs to be changed to where mobs train back to spawn point instead of walking at the same time.<P>4)there are many other good ideas <BR>www.Monkly-business.com has a great idea page which you probably already know about. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

But how can you possibly hope to understand our issues, if you've never played them?<P>Absor if you wanted to we could trawl back through literaly hundreads of statements from VI stating not vaguely but categorically Monks intended position of most damaging meleeists toe-to-to.<P>Further, take it to the community at large... not just Monks, the other classes. Go read any commentary on other class boards (there are some recent examples over on the Rangers glade), where they see Monks in terms of damage compared with Rogues and Warriors.<P>Every time you will see... Warrior, Monk, Rogue.<P>This is not a grey area Absor, so please resist diving into doublespeak on us and trying to introduce doubt through rhetoric on a matter that is quite clear cut.... you're better than that.<P>Monk relative damage has been eroded significantly. We are damage dealers, if we don't deal the damage then what use are we?<P>Also, please don't try and write this off as a flame...

</FONT><HR>Absor, thanks for replying.<P>Id like to point out a few of the suggestions you have on your list that i disagree as being high priority.<P>Critical throws. unneeded. we use shurikins for pulling, we are not rangers.<P>Triple attack. This is not a balancing situation.  Warriors triple attack once ever 30 rounds if they are lucky, unless you give us triple attack as an entirely new skill(maybe through that monk guildmaster quest idea), and cap it at like 200+ its not going to help.<P>The Epic weapon.  This is alot harder to do if its done correctly (through the personal acqusition of the robe, and then the robe upgrade). I think having the LC robe on Zephyl's loot table is sensible in the fact that iksars are kos in quenos, and typically might have to 'steal' the robe to continue the quest.  I really dont think it needs to be changed. its not like every monk has his fists and no mater who multi quests the items for you, the pawbuster pipe and raster camp are simply outrageous in terms of camp length.<P>Why do monks need more damage?<BR>Why would monks need more defense?<P>This is the heart of our problem.  Verant has never decided what a monks role is post 50.  You and your tuning team will now have to make that decision, and work from that point.  If you decide for us to do more damage then a warrior and less then a rogue (say inbetween the 2) then putting that offhand damage bonus, and other various offensive suggestions would give us the boost we need to distinguish ourselves from the warrior.<P>Likewise, if you choose for us to remain only marginally better then the warrior in offence, then you should  consider giving us the means to tank better, as we are forced by our nature to only slightly outdamage the warrior, then we are in the same boat as the ranger was before jolt or the raising of there defense skill caps. In this case, raising our dodge, riposte, block to maximum,(possibly adding another skill as well) would help us tank enough to fill our roll.<P>Or you can do a bit of both.  Since we only do a small amount of damage over the warrior, and have less ac, then giving us a damage boost, as well as a raising of our defense caps somewhat would put us at the midway point of between a rogue and a warrior in damage output while still keeping us in the middle of the road.  <P>Simply put, why play a monk when a warrior has more ac, more hps, and does very nearly as much damage?<P>Also, i will give you a reason where that triple poster didnt.<P>Why should we get a stun?<BR>At this time, monks do not have any way to stun or inturupt casters other then by normal attacks, which is a very low percentage.  Monks kick for upwards of hundreds of points of damage (rarely...usually i FK for 3 and TK for 24). A warrior's kick does damage in the single digets. yet his kick stuns and ours does not? this isnt class envy its common sense and practicality.  If we are suppose to do more damage then a warrior then why does this not carry over to the caster mobs? <P>We play monks so that we can do the damage.  For this we sacrifice equipment with high AC. We accept that.  But as oppposed to the pre-kunark game, where we outdamaged the warrior by a good 50%, we now outdamage them by 10% and thats typically with our best uber rare weapon. This was proven several months ago by Abashi in a test of monk vs warrior.<P>I know youve been beat over the head about this one, but ill just toss my support in.<P>Thunderkick, Flying kick. minimum damage. *cry*<P>Azith Evertoon<BR>53rd iksar monk of the nameless.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I haven't read all of these so forgive me if I repeat others suggestions.  I support the threads by Zadkiel, Bodi.  Enough said there.<P>A few minor "tweak" things that would be desirable to me.  And one off the wall request since I have your attention.<P>1.  Increase range of all our attacks (hand to hand, special).  I lose 2 or 3 rounds of combat with the "Your target is out of range message." nearly every fight.  With force spells, I can accept that, but in normal melee, you get a little pushback, and sometimes every swing counts.<P>2.  Mend heals 25% of our hitpoints, and basically never fails or changes after level 20 (reaching a skill of 100).  I'd like to see Mend heal 33% of our hitpoints in later levels (you folks decide.. 51st is my choice).  I don't think this is unreasonable.<P>3.  Flying kick recycles slower than dragon punch, eagle strike, etc.  I'd like to see the recycle time equal to that of dragon punch in later levels (again in the post 50 game is where this makes most sense).<P>4.  Here's my off the wall one, but you asked hehe..  Last special attack we get is at level 30.  Then we go 30 more levels without something new.  Like to see a multi-mob strike (even if only for 25 - 40hps) for all mobs in melee range.  Sort of a point blank AE for melee's.  I would drool if we got something around 45 that was either this, or maybe unlinking any two of our special attacks.<P>Thanks,<BR>Vladin<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I would like to start by saying that most of these ideas have a lot of merit.  And I am very sorry to whoever is forced to sift through all of these.  My idea/recommendation is a very general idea, and more importantly, i have no idea how easy or difficult it would be to implement, but how about an "ability"/"skill" that would lower that attack rate of a monk in order to raise the chances of a dodge or block.  Kind of along the same lines as sneak's on/off type thing.  It wouldn't always work, but when it did, you would chose how long.  This would be the same as a monk looking for fewer openings to hit their opponent, and focusing on the attacks of their enemy.  <P>Another idea I had is that of quest skills.  Who couldn't see a lone monk somewhere in the frozen wastes who has created a new strike?  He would be the only trainer in all of Norrath.  What monk wouldn't LOVE to attain that skill.  And that would be a rather easy way to introduce skills that would have these stun or debuff effects monks have been lacking.<P>Hope any of these ideas help.  If not, monks will survive, we always do.  Though not always with feign death.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor, I think that you have overlooked a few issues that the 50+ monk community has. Our place in the high level grouping game has been lost. The following section is not a plea or whine to increase monks abilities by comparing them to other classes, but instead a few thoughts to let you undertand where monks stand in the 50+ game. Suggestions on how to make monks fit into the game better will follow.<BR> <BR>Warriors, paladins, and shadowknights all 'tank' much better than a monk. Their larger numbers of hps make complete heal so much more effective that even if they did have lower defensive skills it is more mana efficient for them to take damage. The monks ineffective tanking is only amplified when fighting "uber" mobs that hit for 600+ damage and miss rarely, in which the monk is dead before there is even a chance to heal him. This combined with the fact that the armor realeased in kunark and velious allowed the ac of the "tank" classes to exceed that of monks by a significant margin leaves monks undesired in the majority of situations where a meatshield is needed.<P>Monk damage is also questionable. Obviously rogues are meant to deal absurd amounts of damage now, that is their defining characteristic which makes them desireable and "cool." Rogue damage has been shown to nearly double that of a warrior, making them more desireable in certain situations. This gives rogues a "place" in the high level game, that of a damage dealer. Monk damage is considerable, but is on par with that of a warrior, not of a rogue. In fact, monks deal such a little amount of damage more than a warrior that the monks "place" and desireability in damage dealing is compromised by the warriors increased ability to absorb damage and be healed efficiently. Some of the new weapons in Velious available to warriors even exceed the damage dealing of monks. <P>The monks "old" role of pulling with assistance from the fiegn death skill is no longer effective in velious, and has been shown to be frowned upon by game designers. <P>Tell me then, what role do monks play? They cannot deal as much damage as a rogue. They cannot absorb damage as well as the tank classes. They seem to be headed towards a rogue/warrior hybrid that deals damage somewhere in between these two extremes and tanks somewhere in the middle of the spectrum as well. However, they are not outstanding in either aspect. They are left in the dust in both damage dealing relative to rogues and damage taking relative to the tanks. Even if a group did desire the flexibility of a member that can tank and deal damage, the current monk is simply too poor of a compromise.<P>What can be done to give monks a niche in the current 50+ game? Since they are a melee class it would probably be an enhancement of their melee abilities, ie. to recieve damage effeiciently and/or to deal more damage faster. How can this be done without stepping on rogues and tanks toes, so to speak? The truth is the designers have created a large problem in the game. Specialization is key in the game, as it creates more efficient groups. There are only 2 things for a melee class to specialize in, damage taking and damage dealing. These two area now have resident specialists, rogues and warriors, which leaves monks out in the cold. Note that doing the most "toe to toe melee damage" is hardly a specialty and I see it as an excuse to throw monks to the side when there is no other place to put them, similar to any claims that monks are valuable because they can fight well naked.<P>If monks recieved a bonus to their damage they would also require one of two things; an evasive ability, or increased damage taking ability. This results from the fact that when dealing more damage the monk will often be at the top of the aggro list and the focus of the attacking mobs attention. Simply recieving more defense moves monks into the territory of the warrior. Giving monks more ability to deal damage and an evasive ability simply makes monks a rogue clone. <P>I wish to be niether a warrior nor a rogue.<P>The only way I can see to make monks recieve a place in the 50+ game is to increase their damage without increasing their aggro generation. This also must be done in a flavorful, cool, and "monkly" way.<P>Option 1) Make npcs unable to dodge, riposte, block, or parry monk attacks. This goes in line with the claim that monks deal the most toe to toe damage in the game. A martial arts master should be able to anticipate these evasions just as they are better at performing them. Effectively this makes monks deal 10-30% more damage in an "invisible," monkly, and cool way. It generates no more aggro then we already have (which is arguably too much). Of course we can get this same damage bonus simply by standing behind the mob with the rogues, but this carries problems. When the monk does attract the mobs attention, the mob is now facing the rogues and severly hampers the damage dealing abilities of the rogue and finally the whole group. Allowing monks to deal similar damage behind and in front of a mob allows monks to get this bonus in a group friendly and "monkly" way. I prefer this route.<P>Option 2) Give monks a damage bonus to the offhand attacks. Not neccessarily the same damage bonus that all melees currently get for the main hand, as this could boost monk damage beyond rogues with certain fast weapons (moss covered twig and celestial fists). This suggestion also goes in line with the martial arts master theme, being masters of dual wield and coordination. Since there would be no more attacks then monks currently have, aggro would not be increased at all.<P>I have the overwhelming feeling that the "spirit" of the monk class has been lost to the use of weapons, rogues incredible damage, and warriors incredible ability to absorb damage.<P>I believe you have already seen the problems with a monks aggro and lack of evasion in other posts and are looking into fd's effectiveness in the higher level grouped game. If I am mistaken please adress these issues. Of course there are other issues, but I believe they have been covered already in other posts. It was only the fact that the above issues were being shoved out of the way, either to ignorant posts or poor articulation or any other reasons, that I wrote this, so here it is.<P>Mestre, level 53 disciple of the lost circle<BR>7th hammer server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, very few issues<BR>1: INCREASE DAMAGE AT HIGH LEVELS!<BR>2: When the Hand to Hand skills were brought up to match the 1hb skills, it was made ONLY post 50, makes no sense, why should a level 47 monk not be just as effective with h2h as they are with 1hb? Why are our weapons dictated to us pre 50? (that was a little harsh, though)<BR> <BR>Those are the balance issues, really, as far as Im concerned, other than a few other nice low weight monk weapons comparable to the warrior weapons out there at the same level ranges. I really think the BEST way to judge these kinds of things is NOT to look at how easy something SHOULD be to get. Instead look at actual weapon populations on the servers. <BR>The other issue I just wanted to mention was an armor/quest issue.<BR>Midlevel armor for everyone! Except druids and monks. Midlevel quest armor, without any decent monk or druid quests. Can we figger something for that? Mebbe?

</FONT><HR>The major problems I see with the Monk class become evident mostly at higher levels (50+). The following observations and suggestions deal exclusively with that level range.<P>There are 2 things which I believe need to occur before the monk class is anywhere near balanced: 1) Persuasive reason for a monk to be 1 of 6 people grouping at higher levels, 2) Ability to stay alive in boss mob encounters for a reasonable amount of time.<P>To address 1: <BR>Currently, Monks are invited into groups to provide melee damage, control the numbers of mobs pulled to the group, and in very rare situations absorb melee damage. As you have heard here, there are other classes which now can fill all those roles in equal, if not greater, capacity. Warriors can now come close to equaling the melee damage of a monk, Call of the Hero and the uselessness of feign pulling (as per Verant Interactive's stated objective) gives the warrior similiar-if not greater-abilities in pulling, and there is no question at all of the warrior's superiority in damage absorption. Add to that the warrior's ability to taunt and there is no question of his desireability over a monk in most situations is there? Of the 3 reasons I listed above for monks to be in a group, only 1 is greatly increased by having more than 1 person doing it: melee damage. In this category the monk is an equal or slightly higher choice over a second warrior yet still FAR, FAR below a rogue. Why then should a Monk be invited into a group?<P>The only 3 options really are: increase damage output, increase pulling abilities, or (and this is the one probably least desireable) increase defense abilities.<P><BR>To address 2:<BR>Observation-Many of you are familiar with Ixblat Fer. In a fight against him recently, I purposely stayed out of the fight for a period of time. This allowed the other melee characters to get ahead of me in damage dealt, yet when I began to actually fight, he turned quickly onto me. And when he did that, I died in less time than I could push a single button. Lag was an issue here but lag happens everywhere and it's downright pathetic to not even live long enough to twitch your finger over your defensive discipline button.<BR>Problem-"Ranger Syndrome." Monks do their damage in such a way as to cause significant hate from your given NPC and can neither absorb that nor negate it in any way. Feign death does NOT work for this as it used to. The ONLY practical way to avoid this hate now is to turn attack off at some points and back away from the enemy. That, of course, makes monks inferior to most melee classes in terms of the amount of damage they can provide.<P>The options here are: reduce the amount of hate incurred by the monk without reducing damage output, provide a way for the monk to reduce his hate ("evade"), increase damage absorption abilities, or increase the damage such that it's worth the extra hate incurred.<P>I realize this is more vague than specific but I believe it paints the larger picture accurately. These are the problems; we would all like to see them fixed and there are many good ideas in this thread with which to do so.<P>Thank You,<BR>Copperhead Fang --The Imperial Order--<BR>59th Master, Ayonae Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi absor,<BR>This is my little wishlist I would think help tweak the monk class to what I think they should be.<P>-Treant fist power up, I spent about 90 hours on this quest literally going almost insane to find out that there were plenty alternatives that wouldnt even take me a tenth of the time and result in an item of equal power. I also feel iksar have an edge over the humans and by increasing the power of this it would help equal the playing field out a bit.<P>-Make it so the ROTLC cannot be obtained by killing zeph.. I find it a breach of honor to have to kill yer fellow monks to obtain power. Monkhood should be about honour not bloodlusted power.<P>- I definatly feel we should get a slight damage increase over warriors as we cannot tank at all. Sure we have other advantages but this doesnt make up for the innability to tank. <BR>I recommend doing this by drastically increasing the minumem damage on flying kick + thunder kick its annyoing kicking for 2 damage hehe. Also, say past 55 allow us to use 2 skills at a time so dragon punch + flying kick could be used at the same time. <P>*favourite idea*<BR>-sort of a hybrid of what somebody said. <BR>Implement some quests that allow us to train new more powerful techniques.  Monk class is very much like a martial artist and they always had the teacher to learn from so I think it would be fitting to have this.<BR>say 3 new skills or something. Each could have a different use, for example one could be a stun type attack, another could be a pure damage output type *improve to fk* the final could be some sort of status ailment, like work as snare *long reload*. <P>Those are the ways I think would be great to improve the monk class.<BR>However, if im making a generalized statement of what lacks in the monk class, I DEFINATLY feel the thing that should be improved is our offense capabilties and slight increase at effectivness for feign death.<P>Kryodus Kegmaster lvl 51 monk<BR>Solusek ro, Mystical legacy </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well alot of posts here so far. In answer to your question about where monks are supposed to be in terms of damage dealing. It has been stated time and again by verant that Monks are the masters of melee damage.<P>In fact the reason why verant implemented a delay reduction eons ago on monks fists was because our title as damage dealers was being challenged by other melees. This problem is once again starting to happen.<P>Alot of us chose to play the monk class because of two reasons. First, because we are supposed to be the masters of melee damage. Second, because we are not gear dependant.<P>Absor I understand you wanting to get all the information about the class in one post so that you do not have to waste time looking around on other message boards. However, it might be a good idea to just take a peak at two of the best known monk boards out there. You do not need to look on the board for information specific to this topic. But by just reading a couple posts you could get a feel of how us monks think.<P>To sum it all up. I, along with many of my brothers and sisters, would prefer an increase in damage output to an increse in AC. Currently we barely outdamage warriors and do not even come close to the damage output of a rogue double backstabbing for 400.<P>Here are the URL's to the two main monk boards. Feel free to check them out if time permits.<P>http://pub28.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1<BR>and<BR>http://pub18.ezboard.com/fmmrpgdiscussionmonks<P><BR>Note: Just ignore the anti-twink/anti-iksar posts... the introduction of monk usable weapons into the game has caused some conflict in the comunity <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Master Mers<BR>Paragons of Fury<BR>The Nameless<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The addition of effects for each level of sash/headband such as haste or what have you would also be a nice touch.

</FONT><HR>Ahhhh...a class discussion I can really sink my Fists of Fury into.<P>Ok, first thing, I think that most of the requests for a Stun component to one of our attacks stem not so much from a power/ability perspective than from a desire to be able to better taunt.  Stun has been brought up several times as an option for increasing Monk taunt capabilities (since it's usually argued that Monks shouldn't really get an equivalent of "Taunt" from a RP perspective).<P>I also support adding specials to the earlier attacks EVEN IF IT SACRIFICES DAMAGE, but I'm a Roleplay oriented guy myself  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">.<P>As far as evasion skills are concerned (Dodge, Parry, Riposte), let me tell you how _I_ would like to see things implemented (I know this is probably unreasonable, but I'm going to shoot it out there).<P>All classes that have these skills SHOULD get a bonus to the skill inherent from having a high DEX or AGI.  Monks should get this bonus as well, and (like the AC bonus), should get a HIGHER bonus when their weight is below the monk weight limit (or even below a further monk weight limit).  This would help balance the fact that a monk's armor does not provide much AC protection in a way that could be controlled and would have a roleplaying reasoning.<P>My point being that a Monk should NOT want to focus primarily on Strength where Stats are concerned.  It doesn't make a lot of sense in MY (and I think Verant's) particular vision of the Monk class.  Warriors, yes, but not monks.  We do not just pound...we pound with FINESSE.<P>Of course, that might take some engine changes, and may be well out of the scope of things.  At the minimum, it might be nice to get a bonus to Dodge, Parry, etc when you're under the monk weight limit, even if it's a small one.<P>Just my thoughts...a number of the other ideas here have been good as well, but I think overall Monks (and Warriors) are fairly well balanced.<P>-Zekestrom of the Many Names</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I had this idea on the Monk boards... <P>1) it's a meditate.<P>While medding, you have to sit.  The screen goes black (except for your information/text box), and you can't see what's going on.  However, your regen rate increases.  This would be a post 50 feature, one to even further increase the regen ability of a monk.  I think it's great sense for a monk to be able to concentrate on our wounds (and yes mend does this, but i'm not talking a great amount, like 2-6hp/tick).  It carries a disadvantage, but also has an advantage. <P>2) i'd really like to see a combo type attack... one that uses all our attack skills, maybe proccing randomly... strike-kick-flyingkick-claw all in one, rare like a crit, whatever... but just something to make us proud of our damage =P  i think our damage is pretty good, but it's a _tad_ low.  going a bit beyond what we have now is really all that's called for.<P>that's all i have, would really like it if we got some positive changes =D<P>xian hsiao<BR>55 monkie lanys<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Whoops forgot ONE MORE THING (and this was always my most important request).  As far as quests are concerned, a LOT of people play monks for Roleplay reasons rather than because they're the uber-pHaT-cLasS-dat-RULEZ-YOO!<P>We also know that the results from MOST of the Monk Quests (epic and Treant Fists the only exclusions I can think of) are paltry and virtually useless to a monk.  Believe it or not, there are still some monks who wear the sashes they have collected with pride.<P>So, toward that end, would it be POSSIBLE for you to finish the Headband/Sash quests through Black-level?  Would it be POSSIBLE for you to re-examine the items and determine if you could throw, oh, maybe 1-2 AC at them at least?  And, would it be POSSIBLE for you to revisit the possiblity of having the sashes/belts show up on the character model?<P>A LOT of us were hoping for this when Velious came out and we heard about the "New system for headgear that lets us design really neat-looking headgear!".

These gloves NEED something extra to make them worth that camp.  I think a boost to ATK (firefist?) would be a step in the right direction.<P>** Not only is this a hard camp (I've spent over 22 hours so far and 100-200 hours is not uncommon), but there is now contention from monks who have their epic to get their robe again.  Please reduce the spawn time on Raster, even if you have to increase the spawn time on Qwinn.  As a way to stop monks from re-questing the robe it would be nice if another robe (same stats as RotWF but no effect) was dropped during the CFs quest.<P>*** Simply put: We should have our damage increased to have the same sort of comparison with other classes post 50 as they are before.  An ATK increase level by level from 51-60 would probably be the simplest and most effective way of doing this.<P>**** This is a major beef with monks.  Our planar armour planely sucks (pun intended).  At level 48 I'm wearing a Lockjaw Vest, Azure Sleeves, Gatorscale Leggings and Crown of the Froglok Kings.  The Silver Moon Chestwraps are the only thing on any of the planes that I see being superior to those items.  Even then, I'd drop that for a Fungal Scale Tunic any day!

What, exactly, are monks SUPPOSE to do then besides FD pulling? People play monk because they do the MOST damage than any other class in the game. Period. Verant said it themselves and we believed it. Now they've basically took monks unique feature and gave it to rogues and BAM rogues are fixed!! And to add insult to injury we're now require to use weapons in order to do damage effectively. Monks are becoming a joke everyday. What, exactly, is the *vision* for monks? I'm curious. Here's what I believed in last year when I played one:<P>-Do the MOST damage over all other classes.<BR>-Master at hand to hand fighting. Meaning we don't need weapons and still be at the top.<P>What Verant has done is destroy the monk class completely. They say one thing and do another. So yes I think monks should not only do more damage than warriors but rogues also. But, ah, then what will rogues be good for? If I'd know what will happen to monks I would've picked a rogue and go from there.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here are my views on monk...<P>1-monks should be masters at avoiding damage. While they can not wear heavy armor, they should be hard to hit. I would like to see monks be able to avoid damage better, but if they get hit, ouch. I would rather see more dodge like things then more armor.<P>2-monk special attacks are fleeting in their use because the next special attack just replaces it. I would like to see better use of the monk special attacks. As of now, two attacks get replaced after 5 levels. Adding a special effect to the attacks would make them cooler as well as more useful at later levels.  Perhapse adding a proc 10levels after getting the skill would work.  Dragon punch could proc a extra fire damage at 30 or 35th level. Eagle claw might be a nerve strike creating a temporary "snare" like effect. Jump kick could knock back a monster.  Tail rake might sweep the monster off its feet for a second (same as a stun). <P>3-Monks are master of their bodies. A natural increase in jump height and running speed would reflect this.  I think in general, it would add a lot of flavor to the concept of the martial arts master.  The increase should be ever so slight per level, but become significant in the upper levels.<P>4-there is no way to get the black belt or headband from the human monks without killing them.  In a way, this could work.  Have it that you have to challenge the school's master in a fight and beat him to get the black level belt/headband.  It is not too far off as it is now. You just have to change the faction hits associated with killing the masters.  Maybe you can turn it off when the key words are spoken (I challenge you to a duel!). You would also have to fix it so that no wander npc join in.<P>5-Just as a flavor thing, I thing "masters" should be added to the landscape. Have them sit in a empty building as their dojo waiting for challengers. These masters could train monks to improve their special attack (adding that proc i spoke of before). They can also be sources of quests.<P>6-I dont like the fact i am so dependent on my weapons. hand damage/speed ratio probably needs to be reviewed.<P>I hope my suggestions are helpful.  BTW, i love this whole free exchange with players.  Great step to hear the will of your customers!  Good Work.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I would like to see monks having the ability to use special monk only 1h slash weapons, cause monks did also use swords.

</FONT><HR>no one likes my emphasis CAPS?<P>/cry<P>i only have 1 comment to ABSOR's comments...<P>15% increase damage really isnt going to cut it... i dont mean to sound ungrateful... but consider what each class does for a group.. and also consider what each class is CAPABLE of doing:<P>rogues can do 100% more damage than any melee from behind (after lvl 55+ where double backstab and minimum damage really rule) and can tank comparable to a monk (and they can taunt as well)... if you dont believe me ask a tester<P>warriors do the same damage as a monk... yet can also taunt and tank MUCH better<P>where does the monk fit into this situation?<P>nowhere<P>Abashi has stated numerous times that Monks were SUPPOSED to be the masters of melee... toe-to-toe... dishing out more damage than any other melee<P>well this really isnt true anymore<P>i understand your reluctance to boost our damage output by a drastic 40%... but you really should have the testers TEST a lvl 60 warrior, monk, and rogue in high end equipment... then maybe you will understand why a 40% increase in damage is warranted<P>if you are going to move in baby steps and give a marginal 15% boost in damage... then you really need to consider making us better tanks to make up for that HUGE hitpoint, taunt, AC discrepancy that exists right now between monks and warriors<P>and to answer your question... YES monks were originally supposed to do much more damage than warriors... that was our special ability... to kil fast and quick... we will never replace the warrior as a TANK... but we sure as heck should whip him in damage output<P>otherwise why would any group want/need a monk?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I ready Mr. Absors responses and I laugh. Abashi said a year ago monks were the master of Melee, the dealers of damage, since when in the hell should we fall behind Warrior and Rogues.? <BR>I wanna know.  As far as i can see at level 39, I deal less damage than rogues or warriors of similar sometimes less than my level do.  I cant pull because i get beat to death by everything, and if its a casting mob u can forget it im out of the fight entirely.  So where do i fit in the Vision, no where. Back to looking for a group, any group please god just give me a group this month</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
