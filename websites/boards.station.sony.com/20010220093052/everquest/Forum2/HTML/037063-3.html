</FONT><HR>First of all, there's a big difference between American culture and the rest of the world, and it has a lot to do with both our Puritanical founding and our seperation of Church and State, which actually seems to foster Evangelism.<P>Europeans (and likely Aussies and NZers as well, but never having been there I can't say for sure) are bound to think this whole thread is ridiculous.  Why would anyone get banned for this?  And, indeed, why would it occur to anyone to do it at all?<P>But we Americans love our taboos.  And while I will agree with the parent who has taught their 3-year-old to say "penis" instead of using silly baby-talk, there is a matter of context.  A child saying "my penis is caught in my zipper" is communicating with their mother.  A teacher telling the child "let me see your penis" is doing something quite illegal and probably very harmful.<P>And someone shouting (and I got the impression it was repeatedly... not sure why) the word to the zone completely out of context is clearly just doing it to bother people.  There is no other reason.<P>For those who said that it was "bad parenting" to let kids even play EQ in response to the idea that the person who complained was probably a concerned parent whose child was online in the zone: it is in my opinion bad parenting to allow your child to get input in any form, whether movies, tv, or the internet, in an environment where the parent is not accessible for review and discussion.  It is also bad parenting, in my opinion, to try to block your children from these sources of input to avoid having to review them.  That which is forbidden becomes attractive.<P>Which brings me to a final comment on the morality debate regarding prostitution.  The origins of prohibitions on prostitution are rooted deep in the American Puritanical history.  Prostitution is not illegal because it is untaxable; it is untaxable only because it is illegal.  Where it is legal, permits cost money and income is taxed just like always.  Neither is it really because of disease; with an underground, there is no regulation, and disease is rampant, but properly regulated legal prostitution can drastically reduce the spread of disease.  It is illegal now because sex is "wrong" and violence is much preferred as a method of expression (see our ridiculous gun "control" laws).<P>But there is an issue about legalizing prostitution.  Say a woman is beautiful, but destitute.  Let's paint a tragic picture of someone who was widowed early in life with two small children.  Her husband had a good income and she didn't go to college or work, but now the life insurance won't pay off the house and she has no income and no skills... only two children to raise.<P>So she goes to the EDD and they tell her, "ah, but you're in luck... a woman with your beauty can easily find work in a brothel!  You're healthy and pretty, you can make good money for many years in that trade."  Is this right?  As wrong as it is to tell people they can't or shouldn't have sex, is it right to tell them they must?<P>Generally I feel that vice laws are tools for keeping poor people poor and in prison, but it's hard for me to get over this little hump.  The above scenario is little better than rape.  Most of us know that few people love their job; should anyone *have* to go into this line of work?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>okay, this IS bs.  i know tylas personally, and they would never hurt a fly.  they do NOT deserved to be banned.  this is nothing but a reproductive organ, which, yes, tylas was pretty immature to call out but has entirely no offensive potential, other than if you DECIDED, based upon _brainwashed_ notions of "proper" social norms that have been hammered into your head, to take offense.  those who so decide to take offense to PENIS can do so.  <P>i will start to take offense to the word offense, because i don't like how it sounds, and because it personally offends me.  from now on, should i start /petitioning gms because some robot dope tells me he takes offense to what i say, and i take offense to offense?  ack!  should i begin to take offense to people taking offense to the word offense myself?  omfg, i can't take offense to people taking offense to the word offense, because then i'd be taking offense to myself, if i were taking offense!<P>just chill, everyone, please.  it is just a word.  a word cannot harm you.  only if you are that DIRELY dependant upon what others say is there an instance where you cannot even get yourself to walk away.

</FONT><HR>I have one point to make in this particular thread.  I have seen references to religion as being the motivating factor, and then the blanket insults against religious people begins.<BR> <BR>I am not generally publicly religious, but I have strong personal beliefs in that area.  In other words, I consider myself to be a religious person, and let me assure you, I don't care who ANYONE sleeps with as long as neither one of them is cheating on a spouse.  I have no prudish body tabus, although there are some things I prefer not to see when I'm eating.<BR> <BR>Thank you for your indulgence, I simply wanted to point out that relgion isn't to blame for puritanism, societal pressure to battle over the "high moral ground" is.  They mention people like the Puritans in the Bible, as a matter of fact, they were called "Pharisees."

</FONT><HR>fridayjones,<P>I appreciate your point.  A previous poster did make reference to "religion" as a motivating factor.  Like him, I am an Atheist... but I specifically spoke of Puritanical and Evangelical influences.  These are marginalized aspects of religion, which unfortunately are gaining political power in recent years, but do not describe most "religious" people.<P>Individual beliefs do not hurt anyone.  Mob rule and attempts to use power, whether political or monetary, to dictate what *others* do are harmful.<P>But the harm is done.  We have raised millions of children who canNOT be expected to "handle" the language discussed in this post.  This, IMO, is wrong, but is a fact.  Forcing it on them will only exacerbate the issues of sexual repression and frustration.<P>I can hope that we see the light some day.  There are many, many people with much money and power who strive to keep us in the dark.  If they prevail, the EU is going to kick our United butts in the next century.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I consider myself a distracted agnostic.<P>The word penis in and of itself is not offensive to me.<P>Someone going out and shouting PENIS! in a zone is -looking- to offend someone.  He isn't interested in whether or not there are children out there, whether their parents are watching, etc., he just doesn't -care-.  His sense of humor is so infantile that he thinks it's really funny to see how many people he can get upset.<P>He is actively trying to make people angry - he is being a troll in the game.  To me, THAT behavior is offensive.  Not what he did, but his obvious and undeniable intent.  To offend, to annoy, to decrease other people's fun.<P>Most people I know in game wouldn't ever dream of doing this.  It really just would never occur to them.  Nor would it ever occur to me.<P>The fact that he -would- do this speaks volumes.  He clearly shows that he does not care about other people's enjoyment of the game.  I can't see any reason why anyone would defend him or want him to remain in the game.<P>He tried to piss people off.  He was successful.  Now he whines?  Good riddance.

</FONT><HR>Burly:  What possible context can there be that wouldn't make shouting "PENIS" inappropriate?  As the original poster is a friend of Hibbens, I'd think they'd provide that context if there was one.  As Qwinn stated, the only possible reason for doing this, is to annoy people.  As stated by others from this server, Hibben has an awful reputation for being a dork, KSing, training, and just being an all around idiot.  The banning was clearly not based upon this conduct alone, but on all the other times he acted like a fool.<P>In response to someone else on /filter, the filter does not give anyone license to be a fool.  Read the "cussing" thread from yesterday.  It's pretty well covered.  There is no reason to cuss or shout penis, so your disruptive, non-rp behaviour will have consequences.<P>My guess:  This guys reputation had finally been spread to enough folks, that he was having a VERY difficult time advancing, and was just trying to get banned.  Suicide by cop.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

If that is the case then it is the parents fault to put them in the adult world. I would like to know the average age of the player, I bet it is mid 20's.
