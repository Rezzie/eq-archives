</FONT><HR>Well, two basic ideas have been stated here.  One is the idea that there should be a 51-60 board that should only be accessible by people of that level.  I don't think this is appropriate at all.  After all, if people are giving *specific* examples (i.e. wizard X has Y mana, casts Z spell that does A damage against monster B that has C hit points), why shouldn't a warrior be able to comment effectively on that?  If the wizard is level 40 or 60, I can still make valid commentary on the situation since the FACTS were given (whether I am level 20 or 60 and whether I'm a warrior or wizard).<P>The problem lies on both sides (the 1-50 people and the 51-60) and with most people who post here, in that when someone complains they rarely BOTHER to give all the salient facts.  Most of the w***e posts just say "I don't like &lt;X&gt; because it [is unbalanced/is unfair/is too hard/sucks]."  How can ANYONE, level 1 or level 60, comment effectively on this kind of post?  Even THIS post is an example.  It suggests that we should have a 1-50 board and a 51-60 board that are segregated so that low-level people cannot comment on 51-60 "issues."  Yet, it does not give examples of ideas that were rejected because of 1-50 comment, nor does it cite any evidence that 1-50 input has ruined the game for 51-60 people.  Despite being many levels from 51, I can still comment on things like taunt, be it level 1 taunt or level 60 taunt, because I have the capability to understand the problems being discussed.  Further, my input IS important because I *will* be level 51 at some point, and why should changes be made to that part of the game be made without my input?  If I get to level 51 and find out that things were changed that it turns out I *don't* like, which were discussed on this "high-level" board, why didn't *I* have a shot at offering input?<P>This idea is simply yet another idea from a person who wants to stifle dissent about their issues.  "Anyone who disagrees with me is a newbie and they shouldn't have input about MY issues."  This is the same argument that individual classes have about people NOT of their classes commenting on their issues.  "You don't play a [insert any class here], so you don't know what you're talking about."  I could have played with that class every day for six months, but there are STILL people who would say that I know nothing about the class.  I could have 20 friends (guildmates, perhaps?) who I talk with a lot about the 51-60 game (and who are there now), yet it would be *assumed* by my level that I don't really *know* anything about it.  All of these factors militate towards NOT splitting people off according to level.  Just because you don't like their opinion doesn't mean the "newbie" doesn't have a valid idea or argument, and the fact that I have never been there doesn't mean that I am unable to comment intelligently on a specific situation (which is what we ALL should be discussing here, instead of all the over-generalized w***ing.<P>The second idea posted here was to post everyone's characters and levels as a "signature" on their posts.  I would never return to the boards given that kind of change (you can stop applauding now  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"> ).  I do not NEED to be tracked down in-game and harassed because I am one of those who agrees with the naming policy (to use one of the more controversial examples) and will report names that bother me.  I do not NEED to be tracked down in-game and harassed by that 15-year-old kid that I categorized as a troll because he won't stop posting a new "Verant Sucks" post every other day.  I do not NEED to be ostracized from groups because of *whatever* opinion I posted here.  Those results would be a big hassle and I don't want to have to start all new characters in-game.<P>The OTHER reason that this idea is wrong is because is leads to similar problems as segregating the boards.  If everyone sees that X player's highest character is 40, then there are many people who will just sit back and assume that this person is just a newbie who knows nothing about the game.  While it's true that the person might not know AS MUCH as the higher level person, that alone does not detract from the quality and/or validity of their particular argument.  They *could* be making a very valid point that would be dismissed (and likely flamed) out of hand just bsaed on the player's level.  Most *reasonable* discussions require that you listen (read) and think about everyone's point before you agree or disagree.  Unfortunately, this isn't a place for *reasonable* discussion.  It is too often a place for rationalization, ego stroking, whining and flaming Verant.<P>This isn't because under-51 people post here and it isn't because the board is "integrated."  It's because the collective IQ (at least in terms of what is written) rarely rises above the bare minimum required to feed oneself with a spoon.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I can't believe I read that entire thing...but I can respond to it rather easily.<P>No matter how much you hear about, seen, or think you know about something, you really cannot make a valid comment on it till you yourself have expierienced it.  I cannot say weather Sleeper's Tomb is really too hard for what it's worth.  Though I have heard tons on it, I cannot comment with merit, because I haven't been there.  Retrospectivly, a level 30 warrior who hasn't been outside of Cazic-Thule can't comment on how bad 55+ wizard resists are.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Just the facts.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Good point, and there are definitely things that *I* don't post about because I can't make an intelligent comment.  However, if specific examples and a reasonable case are given/made regarding a potential issue, I submit that in many cases there ARE comments I could make that would be valuable...just as valuable as someone who has actually DONE the thing being discussed.<P>This always seems to come down to one thing, and that's the people who post, not necessarily the mechanics of posting.  The people at Verant who monitor this board DO play the game, and they DO have the capability to play an &lt;X&gt; level character with &lt;Y&gt; piece of equipment against &lt;Z&gt; MoB.  This means that the uneducated, inaccurate and irrelevant comment by a level 45 person about a level 55 player/MoB should be ignored by the team because they should be finding out for themselves when a problem keeps coming up.<P>I am still of the opinion that limiting posts to two or three a day (a rule that I won't follow until everyone *has* to follow it) in each board would solve this problem much more neatly than segregating boards into levels.  It would be easier to identify the trolls and the people taking comments out their tuckus and sliming the boards with them, but would still allow everyone the freedom to read and post what they want (within the posting limit).<P>P.S.- I would also note that level 55 people have been *just* as likely to post whines without any basis in fact (or without the specific examples necessary to bolster the post) as under-51 people have been to post stupid comments about things they know nothing about.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I domnt see why this cant be implemented.

</FONT><HR>I agree.<P>If you dont have a lvl 51+ player, actually it should be 55+ you have no idea.  Everquest at lvl 55 is a FAR FAR different world than it was at 35.<P>At 35 I could pretty much walk anywhere and get XP in a zone.  Getting a rez was a non issue. heck you can get by without a cleric.  6 person groups are viable.  Cash was always an issue.  Never had enough cash, spent time at auctions, selling fine steel, etc...<P>Buffs didnt cost 11pp a shot, there was no such thng as a "raid" you didnt need 30 people to do anything.  In fact most times you could log on and actually start killing within minutes.<P>lvl 55+ you need a key to go anywhere, you cant get any loot without a cleric, you pretty much need a cleric for everything unless you want to risk losing 20+ hours of XP from a single mistake.<P>You cant walk anywhere to get XP, almost everything in the old world is green, anything above green in kunark requires a key or a raid.<P>In SOV you are high lvl yet greens can kill you easy.  at least in the old world, greens were no threat, go to SOV i dont care if you are lvl 60, get 1-3 greens on you unprepared, and you are toast.<P>Its 2 completely differnt games. 1-50 is fun its challenging etc.. but its completely differnt.<P>Until you have planned a raid for 1 week only to spend 8 hours getting everyones corpse and rezzing because of a single mistake or because the cleric went linkdead, you have no idea.<P>The 55+ game is extremely stressful,  it can be exciting, rewarding, but usually its lots and lots of effort and honestly not really worth it.<P>XPing takes too long, raiding for loot takes 8 hours at a clip, getting groups together takes too long etc..<P>at lvl 35 you can run down to lower guk or droga or FM or dreadlands or anywhere in SOV and start hunting.<P>at lvl 55 you need a gate everywhere, or a key or a rogue, there is no running over to a zone and getting a group.  YOu have to bring your group everywhere you go.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just because somebody hasn't been on a raid, hasn't been to really tough zones, or something like that doesn't mean that person can't have ideas pertinent to the 50+ game. Separating the board by level is pointless because you lose many valuable viewpoints. Sometimes it helps to get a lowbie's viewpoint because they aren't biased. More importantly, even as a lowbie I want some say in how the 50+ game will be changed, because I will probably get there someday. It's not just for the 50+ crowd, it's for all of us. I agree that there are a lot of useless posts on these threads, but I'd rather have them than narrow viewpoints and lack of input on the future status of the game I play.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One does not have to be under level 50 to realize that preventing people from being able to have input on discussion is a bad idea.<P>One might also argue that having a character over 50 is an indication that one spends way too much time playing silly games and probably is not properly versed in such fields as statistics.  Therefore we should disallow people with characters over level 50 from contributing to any discussion that involves math.<P>Just drop it already.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
