&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I'm going to try and sum up the overall balance issues with rangers:<P>-No class defining Ability<BR>-Less Hitpoints and AC than other hybrids (others can wear plate) Our defense should be equal to paladin/SK offense<BR>-Broken spells Jolt(get rid of resist or reduce level needed to cast), Strength of Nature (Stacking), Firefist sounds cute but it won't stack with str of nature and that won't stack with augment/haste at least make two of these spells stackable. Call of the Sky (breaks root), is castable and therefore interruptible. That’s right the only ranger stun spell is interruptible, and its a weapon proc! When it procs you get a begin to cast spell message, during which time a mob can hit you and interrupt your proc. Combust SHOULD be a level 49 spell according to the current progression of spells. But in its current state the spell says level 61 Rangers can use it... I'll get right on that! Hehe umm last time I checked there was no such thing as a 61 ranger.<BR>-By the way putting the effect "swarm" on our class only arms is very disappointing, how about immolate or even creeping crud? You really think an 80 Damage dot is worth taking the time to cast as a melee class at level 45-60? No way. I can do 2 rounds of Damage with a CSS/silken whip in the time it takes those arms to cast If I double attack once with a dual wield hit that’s already around 70-80 damage...<BR>-Archery: Warriors NPC's can go berserk on arrows...when rooted. (Root a Hill giant) They dodge arrows while rooted and snared and they are  20+ feet tall... hmm<BR>Arrows disappear...Where do they go?<BR>You are too far above / below your target... I thought the point of a bow was ranged attack.<BR>-Disarm can only be used to disarm rusty weapons; I can't even disarm bronze with a 50 skill...<BR>-Safe-Fall for those who live in 100 foot trees is non existent, but for those who live at the North Pole its a must have.<BR>-Any class can solo if they know how. Paladins and Shadow Knights have many more abilities after level 39 to make it easier for them to solo than rangers. There are no Harm Touch boots or Lay Hands boots. There is SOW boots though...<BR>-Track is the ranger only ability *snicker* See below<BR>-Dual wield is the ranger only hybrid ability...Ever heard of bards? Yeah bards the ones who wear plate, have warrior defense skill and dual wield.<BR>-Brad said downtime is a major issue. Downtime between fights I mean. Casters Meditate... Paladins now get regeneration, SK's can be Iksars or Trolls which have innate regen, and they can drain life...they get pets too! hehe. Where's our bear pet?<BR>-Ranger kick does not equal a class only ability. Pali's and Knights can bash which stuns and at 50+ which would you rather have? a stunned mob or a mob kicked for 25 dmg, a timed stun is invaluable vs casters that complete heal<BR>-Paladins have a whole bunch of paladin quests. Shadow Knights the same. The amount of ranger based quests are few and far between compared to the amount of paladin quest and SK quests.<BR>-The last and probably most Irksome problem is with TRACK. Tracking is what supposedly separates rangers from any other class. Unfortunately I hate to tell you its broken. They have promised tracking changes, what I hear is very exciting. But now as a I look around I see changes being made to bard and druid tracking. when I saw the first tracking upgrade I was so happy. I could con what was on track. The a guild-mate druid said he was tracking down a blue con something or other...my heart sank. They promised these changes to be ranger only. This makes rangers further useless for the time being considering that druid can track close and bards as well, rangers track things form random locations all over the zone so they can't pull very well or tell if any rare spawns or red cons are up close by. When clerics get lay hands and necros get harm touch then we can say that track is a ranger only ability. Until then It remains a large thorn in any ranger's side. So to speak :-) Hopefully Verant will open their eyes to some of these problems. I hate to complain but enough is enough. <BR>I have played a ranger since 1998 and I have never looked back. I believe rangers should have a role in a group that is equal to warriors, and other hybrids. Rangers do a lot of damage but shouldn't always have to tank. But they should still have the option to solo. After all their parent class the druid is arguably one of the easiest classes to solo with, they have teleports, DOT's, DD's Root and snare.<P>Thanks for your time.<P>Xaren Hithorn ranger of Karana<BR>Ruis-Saille<BR>Fennin-Ro<BR>    <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I know that Mirklin, but the answer lies not in giving rangers more AC or HPs or whatever, but in making the Warrior Taunt skill more effective.<P>As for pallies, they can Taunt as well if not better than SKs with their Stun and Root lines of spells (the latter not cancelling your Snare anymore, BTW), so rangers grouping with a SK or pally is really not a problem as for as agro management goes.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This may have been mentioned i've only skimed the thread so far but i would like to see the archery skill and throwing too for that matter go up through use like spell skills do. As it is now they only go up through combat with an exp. mob. Training this skill is hard enough and costly enough as it is. Finaliy if you don't feel it should be changed you should at least change the text on  the surfall glade ranger guild leaded he thinks he can get skill from a target... the silly man.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>AHA!  Hope I'm not to late to give my input!  Itemized lists seem to be the easiest to skim through, so here's what I got:<P>1.  TRUESHOT DISCIPLINE  Still needs work!  I have had incredible results now and then with some shots, but you MISS WAY TOO MUCH!<P><BR>2.  SPELL STACKING ISSUES   Call of Earth not stacking with Shield of the Eigth (velium coldain insignia ring effect).  No reason these shouldn't stack!  And if there is, I disagree!  Heh after the immense amount of time that I spent on the quest, I lose 27ac for 4 more points of damage shield if I want to use it. :-(<P>Call of Earth not stacking with Augmentation line of haste buffs.  Is this intentional?  I'm not sure why, but if it's not, it's something that would make a big difference to this spell.  (going from used once in a great while, to using it all the time)<P>Strength of Nature not stacking with Divine strength, Grim Aura and This new paladin hp buff?  Not stacking with grim aura isn't a huge deal.  If it wasn't intentional, then sure I could see it being useful for them to stack.<P>I think the ranger and paladin buffs should stack for several reasons.  The main reason is that with the 15 buff limitation, you can only stack so much.  Depending on the situation and the presence of a bard, it's very easy to eat up those 15 slots as it is.  With all these new buffs, it adds a great deal of variety and forces players to chose from a larger pool than before.  Kind of like the old dilema with robes.  SMR was your best bet as a caster and everyone wanted it.  Now casters have a much wider variety of robes to chose from instead of having to fight over the 'single best' robe in the game.  (not including planar)<P>Another reason for them to stack would be from an RP point of view.  The sources for the paladin and ranger spells are different!  Paladins call upon the holy powers of godly might!  Rangers call upon the natural forces around them!<P><BR>3.  I CAN'T CARRY ENOUGH ARROWS!  Please reference this thread:  http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/051295.html<P><BR>4.  NEW PLANAR GEAR?  We have one item (helm - tunare only) in the new planes released with SoV.....  Same with paladins and druids.  Why?  If PoM will have druid, paladin, ranger armor please tell me there will be much more in the zone to attract other classes.  Right now PoM is THE most difficult zone in the game to get to.  Especially compared to PoG which is incredibly easy to get to and farm.<P><BR>5.  SELF ILLUSION SPELL   Instead of Wolf Form and Greater Wolf form, could we have Panther Form instead?  I think the panther seems to reflect the rangers stealthy hunter spirit more than the wolf.  Wolves hunt in packs, panthers go solo.  It would also be nice to distinguish a ranger from a druid in their animal forms.  Also, instead of the attack buff, maybe give a lesser attack buff, along with a dex buff.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Mythral,<P>I happen to run semi-regularly with a SK myself, and he can keep things off of me np at all even without jolt (he's one of the damned best SK around, IMO).  However, he's about the only one (I would imagine the more appropriate statement is SK's) that can seriously taunt off me np (a /very/ well played pally that does nothing but focus on taunt can, if I also jolt here and there).  Warriors and Paladins, often I need to manage aggro to keep things off of me, and often requires a jolt halfway through even if I'm using low taunt weapons (2h sword, which, IMO, already defeats our purpose if we need to use less damaging and lower taunt weapons) or jolt regularly (in which case, I have to be careful it might switch to the enchanter or cleric).  However, when it /does/ turn on me, I get wacked for about 80% hit rate (chardok, seb, even low blues in Burning woods), and a good number (60+%, maybe 80%+) are 100+ hits.  That inability to take even some hits without the cleric panicking (loosing 1 bub due to ripostes because I'm using fast weapons also is fun... or when a mob becomes enraged and ripostes all attacks and I loose 80% of my 2.5-3k hp before I can turn off auto attack), is not what a warrior hybrid should be.  If we were a druid with some offense hybrid, then yes, but our spells/abilites/design show us as a warrior hybrid.  While we should not take hits nearly as well as you defensive hybrids or warriors, our ability to take hits in the 50s seems to be much closer to a druid's than warrior's (same Defense, and druids carry shields, and often able to get near ranger AC, such as those ac 14 legs from velious from a quest, etc).  Compound that with lowered AC equipment, HP, a ranger is too fragile even for an offensive oriented mainly melee character.  I do not (well, I do, but I am extremely objective and know what should/should not be) want to tank, but when I get aggro'ed by a mob, I do believe that I should be able to take the swings (we /should/ be hard to hit, and get hit hard) that are inc our way in that time, and not feel like a dualwielding druid instead of a dualwielding, light, agile fighter.  Also, I an not kidding when I mean we tank at best same as druids, I run regularly with a druid, and he literally stood and tanked a mob without significant HP dropping for the 10-20 secs that he tanked (he was pulling due to his higher level and similar AC/HP to mine).  This happened in sebilis, and was more often than not.  To me, that is just wrong.<P>Jaraxel</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I am writing this assuming the current changes to the Hybrid classes on Test will go live. Furthermore, for brevity I refer to Paladins and Shadow Knights simply as “Knights”.<P>Some preliminary remarks. I feel that the changes on Test regarding skill caps for Hybrids are just and beneficial. I also feel that they in no way threaten Warriors, who will still maintain a necessary and desired role. Verant has been doing a fine job in their attempts, recently, to help Hybrids become more desirable.<P>The things I feel still require change regarding the Ranger class are as follows:<P>1) INCREASE RANGER DEFENSE SKILL TO 230 FROM 200.<P>REASON: Since Knights (and Bards) have had their Defense increased to 252 and Rangers have had their Offense increased to 252, and therefore Knights defend and Rangers offend almost as well as Warriors, I feel that a Ranger should defend as well as Knights offend. Therefore I think it is appropriate that a Ranger’s Defense skill (currently locked at the pre-RoK value of 200) should be increased to 230, which is the current Knight Offense skill cap. Knights will still maintain a significant AC advantage, both with regard to Avoidance and Mitigation, including approximately 300-350 more HP. I do not think that this position rationally can be argued down other than by an arbitrary prejudice. Rangers clearly need assistance in Defense, and balancing a Ranger’s Defense against a Knight’s Offense strikes parity between them. Rangers remain the “Offensive Hybrid” and Knights remain “Defensive Hybrids.” This fix (and it is a fix) just allows Rangers slightly better to defend themselves, about as well as Knights are offensively.<P>Defense pre-RoK: RNG/PAL/SHD/WAR = 200/200/200/210<BR>Defense RoK: RNG/PAL/SHD/WAR = 200/252/252/252 (per Test)<BR>Proposed Defense: RNG/PAL/SHD/WAR = 230/252/252/252<P>PAL/SHD RoK Offense = 230<P>The parity here is appropriate and not overpowering.<P>WAR = RNG = 252 Offense<BR>WAR = PAL/SHD = 252 Defense<BR>RNG Defense = PAL/SHA Offense = 230<P>2) INCREASE RANGER RIPOSTE SKILL TO 175 FROM 150.<P>REASON: When Kunark was release, Rangers received zero defensive increases. It was seen later on that this was a mistake. Our Dodge and Parry were increased, therefore, to the same proportions, as they existed with respect to Warriors pre-RoK. But Riposte was not increased, whereas the Knights’ were. Since both Warriors and Knights received 25 skill points in Riposte with RoK, it is felt that Rangers should also have received those additional points.<P>Riposte pre-RoK: RNG/PAL/SHD/WAR = 150/175/175/200<BR>Riposte RoK: RNG/PAL/SHD/WAR = 150/200/200/225<BR>Proposed Riposte: RNG/PAL/SHD/WAR = 175/200/200/225<P>3) ARCHERY ISSUES:<P>SUGGESTIONS:<P>A) Increase Archery skill cap to 252 from 240. There is no good reason that a Ranger should have the same cap as a Warrior.<BR>B) Grant Archery a Damage Modifier similar to the Primary Weapon Damage Modifier. It is unfathomable to me how a 28 DMG bow with 8 DMG arrows can hit for 1 DMG.<BR>C) Consider Double Attack with a Bow, or perhaps Double Attack with Discipline Trueshot.<P>4) HYBRID SPELL STACKING ISSUES. <P>SUGGESTION: It is unfathomable why Verant developed some very nice, unique and beneficial Hybrid-only spells, yet these spells do not stack with each other or with the most common Haste buffs in the Augment-line. Paladin Divine Strength does not stack with Ranger Strength of Nature, and Ranger Call of Earth does not stack with the Augment-line. Please reevaluate these Hybrid spells.<P>5) MODIFY/CHANGE JOLT RESIST RATE OR GIVE IT A SKILL CHECK.<P>SUGGESTION: Jolt’s resist rate or resistance check needs to be changed.

If jolt is resisted forget it I will have to turn off attack.  I always wait till arond 50% to snare.  Any later I risk not having him under control when he starts to dash.

</FONT><HR>My suggestions for the Ranger class:<P>Jolt at 39th--Improved Jolt at 55th<P>All melee weapons have a base max at 1x damage instead of 2x--starts to fix mudflation problems.<P>Smoother twink caps on weapon damage that fixes more than just the max damage on high damage 2h weapons.  Again this is a mudflation fix that should help re-balance melees and casters and make the hybrid spells more meaningful.<P>More damage on hybrid damage spells--I would argue that a more limited range of very powerful spells is a LOT more useful than a broad range of relatively useless spells.<P>Smooth out the 'magic boundary' between too little AC (monster just pounds through for max) and too much AC (monster can barely affect combat).  You can feel the difference when you switch from slightly blue to yellow monsters in all situations.  It is the heart of the Ranger defense problems--unless you bring their defense VERY CLOSE to full tanks, it will still seem like you did nothing at all.  The cliff (magic boundary) is just too steep.<P>The same works out for offense skills:  unless your offense is sufficiently strong to overcome the monster ac, then it is like you aren't doing any damage at all (because you pretty much aren't.)  Smooth the magic boundary.<P>Fix stats so they are meaningful--you make rangers spend a LOT of stats on agility when it makes an almost invisible impact on gameplay.<P>Fix defense and offense skills so there is a DECISION as to whether or not to trade off heavy armor v. light armor.  E.g., if you wear plate, it makes no sense that you could dodge better than someone in chain or leather.  Make dodge 3x as effective for leather as it is for plate...and 2x for chain as it is for plate (or something like that...you guys do the design, we just table talk.)  Block/Riposte are arguably dex based, so use dex to determine outcome there.  Make the curve smooth--if the floor is 75, then give a 1% chance to dodge (agi) or block/riposte (dex) and then increase it to double at 150 and triple at 225.  If you had 3x3% then you're fully dodging 9% of attacks v. a low agility warrior's 1%--you start being able to FEEL the difference.<P>Note that these aren't specifically ranger fixes but instead address the game as a whole.  The combat overwhelms every other part of the game and poor game design favors warriors and clerics over all other classes at very high level.  Either fix the skill cap (uncap the 255) and make a real game, or consider some real fixes to the existing framework.<P>And...not to belabor the point but you don't seem to care about this:  come up with a robust approach to PROVING your design works through modeling and testing.  I will argue that you don't know what any change will do to the game because your modeling tools are either weak or non existent.  This problem has existed on every online game and mud that I've played with the possible exception of GemStone 3 using the ICE Rolemaster rules.  (In that case, the 'magic boundary' still existed, but it was ICE's fault, not Simunet's.)<P>The other advantage to fixing this is that larger ranges of parties can effectively group together because the level differences are visible but smaller.  We really did enjoy grouping with a character 10-11 levels higher and it would have been even more fun if she wasn't SO MUCH MORE effective in combat.  Meleers overwhelm the game, especially at high levels--time to fix it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I really hope you guys buff up the ranger class, but the thing I most want to see is an update to track.  I REALLY hope Verant updates track.  Some things I would like to see happen are <P>1: Make it so that as the track skill goes up, so does the radius that track covers.  At 1, only things within a few feet should show up.  At max skill, a ranger should be able to track anything in the zone.  Adding a scroll bar to the window would make that work.<P>2:  Tracking corpses.  This doesn't make sense from a RL standpoint.  If a ranger can track living beings, then they should be able to track down a dead, decaying, smelly corpse.  I think having the ability to track corpses would be great.  Make it so there is a lvl rangers have to reach to get it.  Like when you hit 30, rangers can then track corpses.<P>3:  Make a /track command.  At max track skill, having a /track &lt;player's name&gt; command would be helpful.<P>4:  Make the track window like the others in full screen mode (meaning it doesn't switch between higher and lower res when activated)<P>Last thing.  I think rangers should get the bind affinity spell.  Not early, but at like 50 or so.  Rangers are a druid hybrid, and druids get it at low lvls.  Making rangers the only tank class able to bind themselves anywhere, and bind others to cities, would make them far more appealing to play.<P>Also, another thought is self only teleports at higher lvls.  At like lvl 52+ adding ranger self only ports would be a boost.  If you look at other hybrids, they pretty much get alot of stuff their caster counterpart gets.  Pally's get superior heal and exp rez, SK's get pets and all.  Rangers should get more of druids abilities.  I think bind afinity and self teleports at post 50 lvls would make rangers alot more fun to play.  I really don't care about the dmg, tanking issue.  I am happy with my ranger's dmg output and tanking ability, but adding track upgrades and more druid abilities would be great.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, so far all the changes have just blown me out of the water with excitement.  I can't wait till new tracking gets implemented.<P>Here's some concerns which probably match everything that everyone else has said.<P>1.) Move Jolt to lvl 49 and have it resisted less and work as often as the Rogue Evade skill:  Justification being that we are, like rogues, a damage dealing non tanking class.  I find myself backing out of almost every fight because of this and clerics just run out of mana too fast for us to even come close to desirable.<P>2.) a 205 Skill in Archery doesn't seem to be too different from a 100 skill.  I still miss quite often, I hit for low damage 10-20 most of the time with a suprise max of 148 one time that I can remember.   Even w/o trueshot bow shots should be able to do at least 3/4 of the damage we can do melee...especially if we're going to be backing out of a fight because of the taunt problem.  Archery should do double dmg on chance instead of whether the mob is moving or not, or even perhaps double damage while moving after 51, and triple damage if the mob is still.<P>Lieah Moonglade<BR>[52 Ranger] Luclin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>DarkAdept said, "In fact one of the best tag teams in Melee classes are Shadow Knight(Taunter) with Rogue back stabber."<P>A Rogue's Defense is 250, same as a Warrior, and higher than a SK/Pallie currently.

By the time you get it at 39, it's a nicety, but we should really get it earlier. 29 perhaps?

</FONT><HR>Mythral-CN,<P>End game:<P>Rangers are now defined as a damage dealing fighter. Three other classes are as well. Rogue &gt; Monk &gt; Warrior &gt;= Ranger. The Ranger is at the end of the list. A very well equiped and well played Ranger can surpass an average level 59- Warrior in damage output though, so there is some blurring of that line.<P>Ok, that's out of the way.<P>Rangers are forced to hold back to avoid taunting. A Ranger who does not do good damage is not good to the group as a damage dealer. The group would be better off getting a class who does not have to hold back so much, does not naturally produce as much taunt, does more melee damage, has better ways of clearing aggro(like a Rogue), or is ok with aggro as the game's best tank(Warrior). There is more to the picture than your skill as an SK. <P>If another hybrid(like yourself) is tanking, they have the benifit of spell taunt. That's even better now that melee timers don't reset with casting. However, Rangers are still going to need to hold back, just not as much as with a warrior. The group is still better with the other choices for a damage dealing fighter. They all do equal to better damage, don't have to cripple themselves like a Ranger, and can take damage pretty well(since they all have 252 defense, etc).<P>Jolt is too late in level, has too high of a mana cost(especially for the 65 wis Half Elfs), lowers damage output, and is a little too resisted(a condition under which Jolt ADDS aggro).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

With Ranger damage increased to that of a warrior, as far as skill is concerned, we will be taunting monsters way too fast. Because of that, I think the following spell change should be made:<P>1) Move Call of Flame to level 55 (to conform with the new spell at 49 and 55 format for hybrids)<P>2) Upgrade Call of Flame to make it more appropriate for level 55: Make it do 350 damage at first and improve up to 375 or 400 at higher levels.<P>3) Move Jolt to level 49.<P>You may want to make Jolt a quest spell and Call of Flame come from merchants as well.<P><BR>Eorlin, Elven Ranger<BR>Tunare Server<P>PS: I am trying to change the chat handle!

</FONT><HR>First, I would like to say that I have read the changes that are on the Test server now and for the most part I think they are a big improvment. I am not quite sure that we really need Panic Animal though and from a roleplaying point of view seems very Un-rangerly. We are friends to animals and therefore should not be fearing them.<P>The boost in our offensive skills to be equal to warriors is probably the most significant change that I noticed and I am in total agreement with it. I do have a major concern our our defensive capabilities though. As most people know, from all the complaints over the years, rangers are Thee taunt class. We deal huge amounts of damage in short peoiods of time, even without the proposed change. This tends to make most mobs extreemly upset at us and tends to lead to an early death for most rangers at higher levels. Being able to do high amounts of damage to a mob is wonderful, but it is very hard to do any damage when you are waiting to be res'ed. <P>I have read the posts on the Ragers Glade website and many people there have had some good sugestions on how to improve our surviorablity. Some suggest improving our defensive skills, boosting our HP's, making Jolt atainable at a lower level and unresistable, and/or a combination of these things. I am not really sure what i would suggest to improve our defense (I am not a game designer, hehe, and I think that choice should be left to the people who know what they want the role of the ranger to be). I do, however, know that we need am improvment in this way, and in fact my choice would be to improve defense and leave our offense alone if I could only have one or the other.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Changes on test for the spells looks great.<P>5. Add the Call of ***** into the spell list at 52 or 53 that adds a snare proc to our weapon, 53 would be better, we only get one spell then.<P>Wish I could give input about Rangers at higher levels, but until I get there I can't comment on it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'll start off by saying I have yet to read the other posts due to my haste to post this.  I was under the impression that the ranger talks were going to be last on the 7th.<P>First off in all respects to those pushing the defense boosts I must disagree.  I know some just demand more defense, but most have stated valid reasons why they feel Rangers need more defense.  Absor I hope you take into consideration both sides in this matter.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>I've always seen the Ranger as an offense based class that melee's as hard as a warrior and adds damage through his/her spells.  Since on test the offense has already been pushed I don't have to ask for that anymore.  But I still will ask for some spell changes that I feel are needed post 50.<P>lvl 52 we get Firestrike...  This spell takes 4.6 seconds to cast for aprox 180 mana(after hybrid penalty)  The total damage dealt out is only 302.  In the amount of time it takes to cast this I can dish out in melee aprox 400 damage with far less agro.  What I say is we replace Firestrike with a Cold version of Call of Flames.  The cast time goes quicker, along the lines of a Rangers speed, it adds a cold based spell to our line up and allows us to be over-all more versatile and effective.<P>lvl 54 we get Drones of Doom.  By the time were lvl 54 nothing were fighting is going to be seriously hurt by a 340 damage spell.  The time it takes to cast Drones is also unfavorable.  The 4.5 seconds to cast the spell can be used for melee and remember this IS a DoT so the damage isnt immediate.  Replacing Drones with Drifting Death will not imbalance our class as a whole and will make us more useful.  Drifting is an extra 300 damage compared to Drones, not overly powerful, but not as weak as Drones is post 50.<P>An upgrade to our Dismiss Summoned would be nice, however I am personally at a loss where to put it in our spell line up.<P>I have seen it mentioned since we now get SLN that SLD should be moved down a few levels.  I agree with that notion, maybe moving SLD to 52 or 53 would help.  We could use the added hp a little sooner, and this brings me to my next point....<P>Ranger HP or lack there of.<BR>I do find it quite hard to believe that the 'rugged outdoorsman' is so fragile.  I do believe that more HP is something we need.  Whether Strength of Nature is changed so it grants ~300 hp at 60 or we recieve natural hp boosts.<P>Tolans in general.  I personally don't wear any Tolan's.  Not because I dont have any or dont have the chance to, but because I dont want to.  The only peices IMO worth wearing are the BP and Legs.  I'm not a tank, stats are more important to me then AC... that and most of the spells on Tolan's is an insult.  4second snare on my gaunts? i'll spend the 25 mana for Ensare thank you.  Besides I'm not gonna give up 9str 9dex on the TV for that.  The Vambraces make me cry.  Stinging swarm?  Heck right click Careless lighting would have been some-what better...  Over-all I think we got ganked for our Kunark armor.  Maybe we're payin too much for the Port spell on the BP. :/<P>Now for my last thought, maybe the best one I've come up with  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>Make Jolt a skill/spell similar to LoH or HT that refreshes at the same rate our hide does (similar to the way evade works).  My reasoning behind this is Jolt is our get out of agro spell, however it uses mana and is resistable.  It also has a cast time that is too long IMO.  <BR>Think about it this way: same speed as evade refreshess, casting time at same speed as a HT or LoH, can be interrupted, can be resisted.  So it fails just as evade can and since we get it post 50 its not like we'll be getting it before rogues get their evade  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>I'm pretty sure no-one has thought of or at least mentioned this as a way to make Jolt better and more user friendly.<P>WELL I'm hoping ya read this Absor and askin that you take my ideas/requests into consideration</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Bump.<P>Increase Defensive caps= Yes Big time, we are supposed to be light, agile, and evasive by the definition of the class.  Keep us more in line with warriors on Defense, not Offense.  I do enough damage now, and will be a complete blender in later lvls with an FBSS, so I need a way to defend myself from my already superior taunt capabilities<P>More HP= I don't care about low HP if I get more defense, and a better natural AC boost, I won't need more HP.<P>Trueshot= What a great Idea.  Too bad it was squashed by the "Vision" =P.  No really, it is a good idea, just needs to be tuned a little.<P>Increased Offense= (erk..) Verant must want to see a lot of dead Ranger bodies laying around.<P>Bind/gate= face it, we deserve those low level druid spell by the time we hit 39.<P>Armor class= see above for increased defense.<P>Spells= eh, I don't mind what I've got now, other than no Bind or Gate, I learn to use them the best that I can.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor:<P>Here are a few ideas that I've come across for rangers in my 42 levels of play.<P>Problem:<BR>Taunt: Rangers are the uber taunting class of Norrath.  Maybe the warrior upgrades will fix this, but untill then, we are typically pullers (outdoors) and snarers (huge taunt).<P>Solution:<BR>Evade at 35 instead of Disarm.  Disarm never works, and I don't bother using it.  We share enough attributes with rogues to where this shouldn't be a problem.  We get jolt at 55, but we start having aggro problems at 35 or so.  It's been suggested to step back out of combat, but I've found that a mob follows us around continually beating us down.  So I stand there and get beat to death, not contributing anything, and generally annoying my groupmates, as they feel helpless to do anything, except pour mana into me.  I don't dualwield, I don't have a haste item, and I don't ask for haste buffs, just to try to keep my aggro manageable.  I don't think I'm contributing as much as I can, but don't really have a choice.  Jolt is much better IMO, simply because now that we can cast and attack, you can keep attacking, jolt a few times, and never stop.  With evade, you still have to stand there not attacking, but it lowers the amount that you'll get pounded.  Generally consider evade as a stop gap until we can mature to 55 and get jolt.<P>Spells:<BR>Most ranger spells are very nice, but I do have a few changes/modifications I'd like to see made.<P>Feet like Cat: Awesome spell, I keep it on at all times unless I'm with a shaman.  But, where's the upgrade?  It's this poor orphan spell that never gets' upgraded.  Without detracting too much from Shaman, possibly an upgrade at 30 or 39 would be in order?<P>Stinging Swarm: Great for pulling or soloing, as long as a druid isn't in the group.  But it uses conjuration, and the only conjuration spell we get prior to this is the mostly worthless dance of the fireflies, which can only be practiced at night.  Maybe something more usefull could be implemented, or at least the only at night limitation removed.<P>Spirit of Monkey: This may be inappropriate, but a lot of our weapons/spells rely on procs, our Call of XXXX line, etc.  Maybe implement this spell around 39 or 49.  I don't think it's too unrangerly to be able to give ourselves a minor dex boost.<P>Now the biggie  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Archery:<BR>Maybe you could balance this with evade, but make this a semi-viable form of combat.  Youngsters might be able to solo, but realistically, could a ranger carry enough arrows to even solo one mob in Kunark?  Would they even want to?  It would give fletchers a major boost if it was semi viable, as well as help the economy.  I'm not talking uber damage, but maybe make it so that there is a damage modifier based on your skill or current level.  Also, as it stands, warriors a little better at archery than we are with crippling blows, etc.  Most rangers use a bow, because it's part of our class (it's even featured in our class graphic), but most warriors use a bow only for pulling.  Could we get crippling blows as well?  (or better?) Also look at the amount of misses we do, it's a real pain missing 30-40% of the time against a mob 7 levels lower than I with an archery skill of 190.<P>Class defining ability:<BR>This is mostly for flavor, but could you all come up with a nifty neat RP flavor class ability?  We are a hybrid, and Paladins have Lay on Hands, and Shadowknights have Harmtouch, could we get something similar?  Maybe like the called shot ability of D&D, where once per day (you could implement it like a discipline) your next successful bow hit does 10x damage or something.  Not overpowering, but just a slick skill to give us something defining.<P>Thank you for your time<P>Ursusfury Ghostbear<BR>Ranger 42</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>First let me thank you and Verant for holding these talks.  We appreciate the ability to discuss these issues with you folks.<P>Since many folks have already laid out much more eloquent arguments that I could prepare, I will limit my post to a list of issues that I support and trust that you will have seen the arguments for them already.  These are listed in order of importance to me.<P>1. Tracking Fix/Upgrade.  I just can't discribe how annoying/embarrasing it is to hit track to try and find a mob, tell your group he's not up, and then have it waltz into your camp unannounced.<P>2. Archery Fix/Upgrade.  As it is now, Archery is impossibly hard to gain skill in, EXPENSIVE to practice, and frustrating to use.  Please rethink arrow part pricing, the high/low limits and skill progression.<P>3. HPs.  With many mobs, Rangers can be drained of HPs so fast that literaly by the time the cleric gets the HP update on their UI, the Ranger is dead.  Even faster casting spells than CH don't go off in time.  More HPs doesn't mean we can suddenly start being the main tank, it means that the cleric has an extra second to get a heal spell off.<P>Thanks again for these talks Absor, and good luck reading them all...  ; )<P>Aizle Rathebone<BR>50th Ranger of Karana<BR>Order of the White Lion<BR>The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't think it's too much different that what most people have posted, but I'd like to throw in my 2cp.  I think the changes so far have been great, and quite helpful, and I'm grateful for a chance at true dialog.<P>First and foremost is damage mitigation.  It is widely agreed that rangers take a triple hit here, with low defensive caps, low hit points, and low AC armor.   Most arguments have compared us to the defensive hybrids (paladins and SK).  I happen to think that folks should also being including monk and rogue numbers too.  We are offensive melee, just like rogues and monks, and in a combat situation, bear a decent bit of resemblance-our role is to deal damage, as per our new post-50 role.<BR>    Examining the other offensive melee, I notice a couple of rather glaring differences-first, our "evade" type skill (spell in our case) comes much much much later, and second, monk and rogue defensive caps around the highest of all the melee, where as ranger defensive caps are the lowest of ALL melee, including bards!<BR>     In my mind, giving monks and rogues such high defensive capabilities, and early evasive skills, indicates that Verant understands that high, fast damage places the player in a continual high spot on the hate list.  I think this really just needs to be applied to rangers as well.  If our roles is going to offensive, we need to be able to deal with the results when the inevitable happens.  What I think would help:<P>-re-examine class armor ac/defense cap/hit points.  At least one of these needs to be increased, and realistically, two should be increased to make us truly useful.  All three would make rangers estatic I think  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"><BR>-re-examine the role of Jolt.  This spell should really be moved down to 49-51, although it would be quite useful at 39 or 45.  My personal preference is Jolt at 45, and an upgrade (upgrade could be less resist?) at 55.<BR>-Examine the drop rates of Thorny Vine armor in the Plane of Fear.  In all honesty, I think just about all the drops in Fear should be re-examined, since the number of drops *per class* on a full clearing of Fear is about 1/2-1/3 that of those dropped *per class* in Hate...and Hate is rarely fully cleared.  Add to the fact the large numbers of rangers, and the fact that rangers are almost required to upgrade to Thorny Vine to remain viable 50-54, and you have rangers spending thousands of hours trying to acquire their planar armor, vs. many classes who can aquire a full set in under 100 hours.<P>Beyond defense, there really are only minor problems:<P>-Archery.  Been mentioned a bunch of times, but I tell ya, for all the arrows I lose, I'm damn glad I use cheap ones.  If the "lost arrows" "Line of Sight" and "too high/low" problems were ever resolved, I'd actually have a reason to use my 200 fletching skill<BR>-See invis.  <BR>-something other than high level Fire based spells would be very nice.  <BR>-a "once a day skill"  Since we're generall compared with other hybrids, this becomes kind of glaring.  The tracking changes will help....but it's still not the same thing.<BR>-at the high level, we really should get one of the unique parts of our parent classes, much like SKs get summon corpse and pallys get an exp rez.  Druids are known for sowing, porting, and high damage.  I'd love to see rangers get a really nice DD at 60-SLN is really nice, but even Resolution overwrites it, so it really still only a soloing spell.  Personally, I don't think giving rangers the 3 lowest level druid ports is unreasonable, but I understand that Verant seems to be of the opinion that melee should run, lots.  Maybe it's to keep us in shape?<P><BR>Talil Stumwald<BR>51st season Pathfinder<BR>Keeper of the Rangers' Tome<BR>Representative to the Confederation of Guilds<BR>Lore Keepers of E'ci<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I want to start by saying thank you for giving us this chance to tell you what we think needs to be done.  I also want to say that I know everything can't be done, and what I list below is not saying that we need all of it, but just some suggestions on things you might try.<P>The changes you put in on test so far are great, I think they will help a lot, but the offensive changes, while I've often wondered why they weren't already like that, create a bigger problem for us, in that they magnify our defensive problems.  We pay a triple penalty on the defensive side, and to make it worse, the fast weapons we tend to wield make us agro very bad.  Something needs to be done in this area, and here are a few of my thoughts on the different defensive areas.<P>AC:  We are fine on ac, about what we should be for a chain based class.  No changes needed.<P>Defense:  200?  All wis based casters have defense of 200, why are we relegated to the same defense as them?  A slight upgrade here, maybe 15 to 20 points would help a lot.<P>Dodge/Parry/Riposte:  Ah, now here is the idea that I like best.  Instead of upping our defensive cap, raise our caps in these skills by quite a bit, this would still allow us to get hit HARD when we do get hit, but give us a better chance of avoiding getting hit, which is much more in line with the idea of a ranger being the light agile fighter.  At least give this a thought, I think this is the area where you could best tune our survivability while keeping that vision.<P>HP:  If nothing else is done, and even if it is, this NEEDs to be looked at seriously.  We are the only melee class that did not get an adjustment here in Kunark, which is when our problems began. A modest increase here post 50 would help us survive just a little longer, maybe just long enough for the healer to land a heal.<P>Jolt:  Our biggest problem right now is taunt.  The super fast weapons with which we do our best damage, are extreme taunts because of the speed.  Until lvl 55 we do not have an easy way of reducing agro to mitigate the damage we take.  One of the only options we have is to stop attacking and retreat from battle, which costs us damage, which in the eyes of a group is a bad thing.  Please consider moving Jolt down to 50 or 51, and reducing it's resist rate, or perhaps putting an upgraded version back in at 55 which has a lowered resist, It costs us damage every time we have to cast it.<P>That's my ideas for the defensive side of things. As for spells, I think lowering SOW to 30 wouldn't be a bad thing, or perhaps something like Scale of Wolf pre 39, with it's intense restricitions, it's really only good for travel, and not very good for that.  A see invis spell, needs to be considered, maybe adding a see invis to our Eyes of Cat spell.<P>Please look at the stacking issues with Call of Earth and Strength of nature.<P>Please consider making Call of sky and Call of Fire castable on others (maybe group only), this would go a long ways to making us attractive to groups.<P>Please consider fixing the line of sight issues on archery and also consider some kind of min damage modifier here, and also, raise the archery cap for rangers to 252, we are supposed to be the masters.<P>Tracking: Implement the changes that were announced and you'll make a lot of rangers very happy.<P>Disarm: Please just remove it.  I would like to see something useful in exchange, perhaps a very low level safe fall.  As it is, I'm level 49, and in the 14 levels since I have gotten disarm, I have yet to actually disarm something, not even the level 2 and 3 decaying skeletons and orc pawns.<P>Again, thank you for your consideration, I don't expect, and honestly don't want everything I have listed, I do firmly believe that a few of the options need to be done to balance rangers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>All of the main points I agree with have already been stated, but I'm here to voice my support for them.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>More hit points - 1423 base hit points now at level 56. 1938 with all of my gear on and my gear is not shabby in the least. <P>Lower the resist rate on jolt - I think the spell is great a lot of the time, but in epic battles or in most of velious, it's useless. <P>I like the offensive upgrades, but I'd like to see some measure of defense or aggro avoidance to go along with that. <P>Overall, still love playing my ranger and I'm having a good time. <P>-Donal Rootfinder<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I know this is a class balance thread but this was just way too funny not to pass along where Absor can read it.  Found this on Ranger's Glade.<P>---------------<BR>I keep hoping one day I'll get a leetle puppy companion. Maybe not much damage in a fight (if any) but someone to keep my company on those long-assed runs from freeport to Halas. <P>I also have this hilarious image of me casting harmony, telling him to 'fetch' the targeted mob and have him run up, hit it, then come right back to me. (what, you never played fetch with your dog?)<BR>---------------<P>Couldn't help getting a Lasie picture in my head.  "Lassie, I got rooted and am getting ground up like a hunk of hamburger.
