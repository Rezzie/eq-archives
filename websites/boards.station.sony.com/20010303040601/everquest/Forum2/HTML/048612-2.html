</FONT><HR>Absor:<P>I sincerely hope its fixed as well.<P>I'm not sure when we'll try again.  Since this wasn't an admitted bug to begin with, the shimmering pearl lost due to the second Ragefire poof was not reimbursed.  Since that is a couple hundred person hours of effort down the tube, our guild is understandably a bit disenchanted.<P>It would have been nice if customer service, specifically the Lead GM on Bertox, Axgorath, was informed that Ragefire poofing is a bug.  According to him, this is a feature, one for which we can not be reimbursed.  I must say I am not terribly impressed by this particular "feature" of EverQuest.  <P>I am glad that some attention has been paid to the Ragefire problem.  And I truly do hope it has been corrected.  However, returning the pearl Badina and others like her lost to this particular problem seems like the minimum that can be done to satisfy frustrated clients.  Please instruct your GM team to do so.<P>Paeter</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Technically this mob poofing stuff isn't a bug.  <P>Since day one, if an NPC get's the kill on a mob, the corpse will poof, and since a linkdead player is considered by the game to be an NPC, well, if he gets the kill guess what, mob's corpse poofs.<P>The solution I think is to make it so a LD player is NOT considered by the game as an NPC.  The drawback here is, when you go LD (notice I didn't say IF, I said WHEN) and are attacked by a mob your character can't defend itself, which I believe is the purpose behind LD players being treated as NPC's in the first place.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Happened this weekend in Western Wastes on one of Verants AE Happy LD Dragons. It is not fixed. The reason they are not able to replicate it is because they are not taking the dragons on with 28-34 people with varying degrees of connectivity to the server. I have been on raids where half the people go LD from one AE attack. This either ends up being a messy Corpse Recovery or the MOB goes poof because 3 or 4 LD wizards are nuking the snot out of a dragon and get the kill.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Apparently, Ragefire is still poofing.  On more than one server.<P>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050517.html<P>Absor, I recognize that the corpse-poofing-to-NPCs code has a reason for existing.  I further surmise that Verant is resistant to removing corpse poofing as it pertains to players in NPC mode in light of some real or anticipated player exploit.  Therefore you and your customer support staff choose to consider this a feature instead of a bug, thereby costing players of hundreds of person hours of effort each time this "feature" activates with Ragefire.  GM's claim they can't replace the shimmering pearls lost in this fashion, since it isn't a bug...  <P>But I can accept that.  I don't like it, and personally I think it is extremely short sighted.  But your position is clear, even if misguided and damaging to Verant's client relationship.<P>However, a potential solution has been offered in this thread and others.  Allow players to disable linkdeath AI (so that they can choose to stand and die rather than fight after LD).  I can not imagine how this could possibly be exploited, and it seems to be a potentially simple solution.  <P>Instead of adding more and more complex and apparently ineffective code to the existing corpse poofing routines...if they can not be eliminated, then give us the option of sacrificing ourselves to prevent the problem.<P>Paeter</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>So Absor, what exactly did all this extensive testing you guys did involve? Did you try and replicate LD's? If not why not? Clearly 90%+ of corpse poofs are being attributed to player LD's. If you ignored this then you guys wasted whatever time you spent.<P>As this is clearly not fixed and is still clearly a major flaw in EQ design then you owe it to your customers to compensate them if affected by the bug. Tht either means you examine logs in cases where players claim a corpse has poofed or you have a guide/GM attend EVERY ubermob slaying and give them the authority to referee it. What the hell is the point on having guides attending these raids if all they do there is add to the lag? If they don't have authority to remedy the situation (or worse still their word isn't even good enough to you guys) then they shouldn't be there. Let them sit at derv camps working out PnP disputes.<P>You still haven't answered why players have to continue attacking/casting after going LD? What purpose does it serve? It makes 0 difference to a players chances of surviving post lvl 20. Please re-examine this, at the very least it should be player configurable if they wish to carry on attacking after going LD. Why not even have a poll on it?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ok lets run over this one more time. You have some problem with the coding of Zordak where all of the sudden you have him poofing what looks to be about one-fifth to one-third of the time. You have clerics losing pearls once, recieving a new one, taking a lot of precautions regarding LD and it happens again. These people are now SOL due to a bug you now know is verified. They have been told there wont be a third pearl. <P>You have CS staff sending Emails to CUSTOMERS that they followed the wrong steps. The dragon wont even SPAWN unless you do the right steps. If you are going to have CS people for gods sake educate them on what the heck is going on!! These clerics didnt follow the wrong steps they followed the quest and were stymied by a programming problem you KNOW is there. To tell them that they are guilty until proven innocent simply because your CS rep isnt reading your OWN patch message regarding Zordak Ragefire is simply insulting.<P>Your people have resources to verify what does and does not happen in game if these people have successfully done what YOU required of them to complete a quest simply give them the heart and let them move on. Its kind of funny I suspect that this change occurred from one of your coding on a previous patch because it simply wasnt an issue when the quest first started being completed.<P>BTW there has been a cleric given a heart by a GM who either saw or verified what had happened simply to keep the 30 plus customers who came out to help said cleric happy customers. <P>GMs can create any item in the files yes? Quit trying to test it on the test server have some PLAYERS do it for you on a PLAYER server--how hard is that to do ? Just because you cant duplicate it with perfect connections on test doesnt mean it isnt happening. <P>Belkram of BB <P>PS I already have my cleric epic weapon I feel strongly about this because we have had about 4 or 5 Zordaks poof on our server and one poor cleric has had it happen twice. This cleric's name is Lizwulf and she will not ask her friends to go thru the many hours and deaths it takes to do this quest. Besides she has already done it once. She is the one that recieved the CS email telling her that the wrong steps were followed please educate your CS staff and adress this issue properly--its no less than your subscribers deserve.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Oh and to the Mages that posted on this thread--this isnt about how easy or difficult the quest may be its about taking LD out of the equation so that a mob that takes a lot of effort to kill and even more effort to spawn isnt lost due to a silly bug. If this thread were about Quillmane poofing not just once but over and over again I suspect you would be up in arms. This crazy LD problem can affect you on ANY spawn large or small but its more evident on dragon hunts because of the numbers required to do it and the fact that once a PC goes LD they revert to NPC status. <P>Due to the fact that this is a epic mob this is being brought into the spotlite and I  would say thats good for every player because this may help prevent this sort of wasted effort.<P>Belkram Edgewalker of BB</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"That is why people go LD in these large encounters. Basically you are getting spammed with others' hits, damage shields, others' misses, your hits, your misses, etc.. etc. even when you have the chat filters on. And when a mob has an AE spell it causes a huge burst of even more spam because it hits everyone near you."<P>Chromite is exactly correct. You are filtering the message spam on your CLIENT, but the SERVER is still flooding your connection just as badly as if you turned off all the filters.<P>There are a few things you can do to cut down the spam, but they're VERY crude and you will lose a lot of combat efficiency in the process.<P>Dispell any damage shield the monster(s) may have right away.<BR>Do everything possible to limit the number of people being hit by the AE at once (ie no pets, healers stay outside of the AE range, casters go in range only to nuke at the end, etc etc)<BR>Have all the tanks use slow two-handed weapons<BR>No pets, and go with the *absolute minimum* number of people you can get away with. If you have extra visitors or what have you, have them stay far away.<BR>Nobody uses AE's of any kind whatsoever. No AE stun or mem blur or any of that.<P>Combine all this together and you just might get through a fight without any linkdeaths.<P>The problem will still be there, and Verant will still need to fix it, but this might do the trick in the meantime.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Do you want Verant to reverse it's policy about not returning items involved in Epic quests when a bug destroys the item or "poofs" the mob?<P>Simple.<P>Everyone involved who has had this happen to them simply cancel their accounts, send Verant's customer service a reasoned, polite explaination as to why you have taken this action and post on every non-verant owned, EQ related board and newsgroup why you are making this protest of Verant's policies.<P>Ask your friends and guildmates who have not been involved to support your action by canceling their accounts as well.<P>According to Verant's policy concerning canceled accounts, your characters will be safe and waiting for you to come back a guaranteed minimum of at least 6 months time. This is noted under the billing faq posted at:<P>http://www.station.sony.com/everquest/<P>I would expect that this may be the only way to force accountability from Verant... Hit them in the pocketbook and make known to the public exactly how bad things are concerning customer service and Verant's accountability to its customers.<P>No company which is out to make a profit enjoys losing money and bad publicity. Labor strikes and public protests are used by dissatisfied indiviuals because THEY WORK.<P>If only 100 people per server were to take this action, with the express purpose being a boycott of the game until these issues are corrected this would result in a loss of nearly $40,000 dollars a month which Verant would have to attribute to these problems...not to mention the amount of bad publicity Verant and EQ would receive from such a protest.<P>I expect that this would inspire more of a change in policy than 1000 people per server who gripe about these problems but still pay their $10 every month despite the lack of action.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It does effect more then the cleric who lost an item. I have no intention of spending a lot of time trying to do something when the chance of it poofing is extant.  If I go help a friend do a quest I certainly feel that I am impacted if the quest doesn't work properly.  AFter all, I spent time with the person, I worked on accomplishing it, I like the person.  I am a generally optimistic person, and I generally assume that people will do the right thing, it seems so patently obvious what the right thing to do in this situation, I fail to understand why VI is making its customers pull teeth for a positive and reasoned and just response.<P>please reimburse anyone who lost an item to this, you know it exists, because you have logs, you have threatened us with canceling our accounts if we pretend to lose something that wasn't really lost, it would seem that if your logs are defective you would go ahead and give your customer the benefit of the doubt.<P>43rd Cleric of Bristlebane<BR>Quellious Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The chat filters are all client-side, this is correct.  They have nothing to do with going linkdead or not.<P>By the same token, updates are sent to the client within a certain radius, the direction you're facing has nothing to do with it... culling in that fashion is entirely client-side, otherwise you'd turn around and not see any spell effects or whatever until the next server update (which clearly doesn't happen).

</FONT><HR>I have to bump this post. This happened to one of my guild's clerics as well. He was told to basically do the whole thing over again. I can't understand why they do not re-imburse the lost item when this is obviously something that could easily be fixed, and would give them necessary postiive PR. As it is, they are getting massive negative PR for not helping out their customers.<P>I know he's probably not going to be re-imbursed for his first, failed attempt, but some kind of assurance that this won't happen again (or mandatory re-imbursal if it does) would be great. As it is, you're going to have a lot of clerics not try to complete their epics because of a lack of faith in Verant's PR policy.<P><BR>Eleriath Pelandriel<BR>Level 53 Paladin of Tunare<BR>Iron Cross - Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
