There may be a few discrepancies here and there, but it would take a nit-picking complainer to pick them out and complain about them.<P>Warriors do a good deal more damage than paladins.  Warriors tank a little better than paladins mostly.  In certain high-end, high level raid situations, there is no tank substitute for a warrior.  In everyday leveling, even at high levels, a paladin makes a superb tank.<P>In exchange for being the best damage sponges and doing the third best damage in the game, warriors don't have the ability to cast any spells without the use of certain items.  For the most part, the spells that they may cast with items are very minor.<P>Paladins have the ability to heal, LH, and their place in high end raids is stuns.  Cleric, enchanters, and paladins are great stunners.  However, clerics are often too busy casting CH, and enchanters are often busy mezzing.  So who's going to stun that mob to keep it from complete-healing itself or gating to a safe point?  The noble Paladin.<P>With our healing abilities paladins make an excellent solo class, IMO somewhat better than ShadowKnights although this is debatable.  Have you ever had trouble finding a group?  With a warrior if you can't find a group, you either a) keep looking or b) play a different character and try again later.  The only way around this is to have VERY costly equipment.  A Paladin who can't find a group can just solo while s/he waits  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

We have no offensive spells (apart from a few Undead DD's)<BR>4) Our healing/buffing is ok most of the time (few people know that at lvl 39 we are on par healing-wise with a druid!)<P>So, why play a Paladin, then? Quite simply because you have to fight each fight thinking! Your damage output won't keep you or your group alive.<P>You will have to learn crowd control (root parking) the moment you get your hands on that Root-spell.<P>Who do you use your Lay on Hands on? The main tank or the cleric if things go bad?<P>Who do you pull the adds off first? Enchanter? Cleric? Wizard?<P>Mob casters putting the smack on your casters? Switch from 2hd to 1hd/shield in mid-fight to interrupt or stick with that high damage 2hd and stun?<P>Sure, it needs tremendous skill to play a Warrior right, too. But in the end his vastly superior damage output and his higher hitpoints can correct a mistake. As a Paladin, a mistake will quite likely get you killed.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Lots of opinions and not one addressed the original question.<P>The question that was **NOT** asked:  Are paladins a playable class?<P>The question that **WAS** asked:  Are paladins balanced?<P>My opinion:  They are close to being balanced, but not quite.<P>(level 40 paladin is my main)<BR>The developers have stated that post-50 they discovered that paladin damage output was well below what they had intended.  Apparently paladins were doing about 50% of what warriors were doing and this was considered too low.  <P>Maybe it's just me, but from my experience (pre-50) paladins reach about 50% of the damage output of what warriors inflict.  I'm lost as to how post-50 this is bad, but pre-50 Verant considers this ok.  <P>I would not ask, and certainly not expect, for paladins to become equal to warriors as far as damage output.  But simple changes would go an extremely long way to putting paladins into that balanced state.<P>2-handed weapons doing better damage.  Paladins and shadow knights are clearly the main users of 2H weapons.  Why?  Because all other melee classes dual wield.  This should indicate just how much extra damage 2 weapons provides, and every single player in existence knows it.<P>Better selection of 2H weapons.  The list of 2H weapons that are available is actually pretty short.  Even worse, they drop from mobs that are 10+ levels above where a paladin would find the weapon useful.  <P>Better selection of shields.  If the paladin is the premiere "stunning" class in raids, wouldn't it be nice to have a decent shield to do it with?  The measley 10-12 points that most low level shields provide does NOT provide incentive to switch from a high damage 2H weapon!  A shield that provides 20-25 points, however, would pose a serious dilemma!  <P>These little things will not imbalance the class, but they will make life a little easier.  Best of all, shadow knights could be just as easily included in these changes.<P>Lance.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

A much better protective item is a high damage sword that causes the fight to end quicker (and thus mitigates taking less damage).<P>Would an AC 18 shield available to a level 10 character imbalance the game?

Our self regen spell only adds about 100hp during a typical fight, not enough to make up for the warriors more hitpoints.<P>The whole, Paladins heal as well as Shamans and Druids at such and such level is not true either.  We can't cast a regen spell on others, and the amount of mana we will have is much less than a Shaman or Druid because we need AC equipment not WIS equipment and we would have to med the whole fight.  I can cast greater healing about 8 times if I have full mana with 114 WIS.  If you are in a patient group after 45 you can use a deepwater helm to heal, but you have to sacrafice the better valor/heroic bond buffs and you'll always be low on mana because you won't have time to med.<BR>We are nothing special against undead mobs except that we can cast invisibility against undead I guess.  In the time it takes to cast the undead DD spells you'll probably do as much melee dmg, so what's the point, and a mithril 2hander will out dmg a ghoulbane against undead even if you consider the rare proc of ghoulbane.<P>I can't think of a raid type mob that wasn't a giant or a dragon or just 55+ so unstunable.  Our stuns are resisted a lot because of the add damage component and higher level mobs tend to have high magic resists.  Also while we are stunning we don't do much damage, but if we can chain stun a mob it makes for an easy fight, we'll just be oom afterwards.<P>Paladins can tank if you can't find a warrior.  Unless we have some kind of mana regeneration we really can't do more than one mana related task at a time, either we stun during combat, or we heal after it.<P>We do excel in groups that aren't very well rounded since we can do several things, we just do none of them exceptionally well.  Paladins are also top notch at protecting casters since our stuns can prevent the finishing blows to the caster and have a high taunt.  Paladins pair well with most other classes that can do some damage.<P>Oh well, enough of my rant.<BR>Just my opinions.<P>Kinamaf<BR>53 Paladin<BR>Zebuxoruk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=012297&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=012297&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
