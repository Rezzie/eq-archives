</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;There is one thing that REALLY bothers me about Harvest though. It permanently uses up a spell slot. Now, you might say necros need to use a spell slot for lich, but once they cast it then they can unmem it until they need it again. Same goes for clarity.<BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Wizards can not afford to EVER unmem harvest<P>It's a tradeoff.  Wizards decide whether or not they want to have the spell available always, and "pay" for that decision with a spell slot should they choose that they do.  <P>It's a good enough spell that it is worth a slot, at least for those who keep it memmed all of the time.<P>-Gordon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I found it useful for emergency and travel assistance then, but now I find that at 31st level, I can't afford to put it in a slot and have to wait 15 minutes for it to be available.  I am finding myself in a healer role more often, so I have to have Heal and Greater Heal loaded, Snare or Ensnare is a must, Gate or Evac, SoW, one DD spell, Creeping Crud, and usually Harmony.  About the only thing I could drop in a group would be Creeping Crud.  I had totally stopped using it on Tribunal after the change, because I couldn't afford the wasted slot.

</FONT><HR>ok boys and girls.  This message is to all of you missing the point.<P>A class specific ability is one that is not shared with other classes.  This means those of you posting those really, really annoying posts about how this is class envy and those other people who come here and show incredible ignorance by posting things about how they have spells too that should be abilities are obviously not reading the post.<P>Harvest (like Harm Touch and Lay Hands) is an ability that is not given to any class but Wizards.  Gate, fear, healing, and feign death are all multi-class shared.  That means that the concept of a spell slot being allocated to them makes sense.  If Harvest were shared with another class, it'd make sense to be a spell.  It is not and therefore makes more sense as an ability.<P>I don't expect to ever illicit a change in wizards anymore.  Countless thoughtful posts are either ignored or are ruined by people who begin screaming class envy and bringing other annoying statements to the wizard thread to distract or troll.<P>Whine and moan about wizard threads all you want.  There are glaring, obvious issues with the wizard class.  Why does everyone feel so threated with simply talking about them?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>There's a big difference between class envy and class improvement posts. There's also a big difference between whining and presenting a well thought out argument for change.<P>Let's step back for a moment and ask ourselves why wizards got harvest in the first place. Someone asked in a response what a wizard was before they got harvest and made reference to shrubberies...<P>Not a bad analogy! When a wizard runs low or out of mana, they are the most useless class in the game. They found themselves in the not-too-enviable position of being a wallflower for extended periods of time, even when managing their mana well. A good group outpaced a good wizard before the Kunark expansion.<P>Now, the argument that wizards were supposed to be masters of magical damage and aren't is as old as Everquest itself.  We were told by Verant time and again that our payoff for being able to do damage fast was that we would be outdamaged by the pet classes, and there is nothing any wizard is going to do to change Verant's mind about that. Whether that is an inequity or not is up to you to decide.<P>However, it is clear that somewhere in Verant's think tank the wizard complaints were at some point listened to.<P>Because Harvest was added to the game. There was one compelling reason for this spell to be added. WIZARDS COULDN'T COMPETE. Wizards were subpar. It was done somewhat quietly, without anyone at Verant coming out and saying "Gee you were right, you WERE always out of mana."<P>Any way you slice it, HARVEST WAS PUT IN IN AN ATTEMPT TO BALANCE THE WIZARD CLASS. <P>To suggest that harvest is the only spell that a wizard needs to have up is a joke. People say "Well I wouldn't unmem my heals." Great. I wouldn't unmem my nukes. It is not like divine aura, or any other spell of that nature. It was put in the game to tip the scales closer to even.<P>Why then am I, as a wizard, paying a price to come up to par with other classes? Why should I sacrafice my versatility to be up to par?<P>I highly doubt now that Gordon has responded that he will even read this again, but dismissing this as a spell I can mem or unmem like any other is demeaning.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>When are you people going to realize that Abashi does NOT like wizards? Look at all the changes to the wizard class versus other classes and you will see that very few come close to the wizard in absolute disregard as to balancing... Not many changes have been made and very, VERY few are meaningful. Spells that teleport you to places that are way too dangerous at the level the spell is given (CT, etc...), spells that are given at a level where the wizard could not possibly get them (lvl 39 Brainbite, my retired wizzy is lvl 51 and I still can not finish this one), and a whole host of spells that are downright useless (for every one you can name worth a crap I can name 3-4 that suck). Bottom line, Abashi got ganked in PvP by a wizard and has been spoon feeding the class junk ever since, except for harvest, which is barely passable as a improvement (need proof, remove the spell from your slot, it really doesnt make that big a difference). Wow, they might change the damage message for Ice Comet in the current patch, man that will sure make me bring my wizard out of retirement! Funny how the class defining spell gets trumped the very next level (51) by a fire spell in efficiency (Draught of fire) so much for waiting 48 levels to get IC, LOL!!! I apologize to the people who play wizard as this is not meant as an insult to the people who play wizard, but rather a "I give up trying to play this class" to Verant. Why? The only time I get called for groups is when they need an extra evaccer. I have been in tons of groups, everyone loves the job I do and they all believe I excel at the class but honestly would rather have an extra enchanter/cleric/monk. Small wonder the wizard is retired and donating all relevant gear to his younger brother, the enchanter. I will quit the game cold turkey before I give Abashi the satisfaction of seeing me start a necro...<P><BR>/rude Verant<P><BR>Llaars<BR>Lvl 14 Enchanter of Tunare<P>Alaadin Mastablasta<BR>Lvl 51 wizard (retired) of Tunare<P>Baeaan Marr<BR>Lvl 23 Paladin (semi-retired) of Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
