</FONT><HR>  First off, I apologize for using your competition as an example.<P>  I was watching my friend play Asheron's Call (did I say that I apologize?) the other night, seeing what it was like (regardless of anything said in threads on these boards). One thing I noticed in the game, was what I could best describe as a compass/radar. I'm not going to assume that you or anyone else has ever seen Asheron's Call, so I apologize if any of the following information is common knowledge.<BR>  <BR>  In essence it is a compass (in that it shows which direction you are facing/heading) that has "blips" on the screen (a la Radar). Yellow "blips" are MOBs, White "blips" are buildings and (I think) other PCs. It has a line-of-sight area (approx 90 deg), and the rest is out of sight (grayed over).<P>  Could something of this nature be implemented into EQ? This would be immensely helpful to players. Being able to see any and all MOBs in your general vicinity would be a great help. I can attest  personally to how valuable it could be, as I've been attacked countless times by MOBs I didn't even know were there.<P>  If there is even the slightest possibility that this feature could be included, then PLEASE see to it. I can't think of a single reason why every single player wouldn't love it if this was implemented.<P>AWM<BR>Torvonnilous</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Why should you be able to see ANYthing that is out of your field of vision?  That is what trackers are for (ranger, druid and bards).  If this was an alternate view for the tracking classes, that would be cool.  But as a non-tracker, you should only be able to see things that are within your visible distance and not blocked by some other object.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well the thing that tracking is good for is allowing players to find mobs of appropriate level to fight no matter if named or not. For instance with my Ranger I will track and see what is on the track screen that I can fight, and then track to it whether it be named or not.<P>The one way I could see this being implemented is with just a dot that was colored based on pc or NPC no names or levels whatsoever, however it seems like this would still be a nerf to a Rangers track ability which is the one skill that makes them unique.<P>A better thing to do i believe would be to have in game maps that you could aquire through fighting or trade that would allow you to look at them, and they would show a dot on the map that represented you on the map with your loc. The map could have labels on it for zones and such, and then if you clicked on a part of the map it would give its loc. Therefore it would be used to travel to different locations not to find people but would still be cool.<P>Also you could have maps for different zones as well as continent or world maps. It could also list camps and stuff on the maps, so for instance the orc camp in G. Faydark could be marked on the map and at least you would have a general idea of where to go to find the Orcs.<P>Another idea would be to have labels put on the map dynamically as you talked to NPCs for instance if you talked to a NPC and he told you there was an ORC camp to the north then it would show up on your map. Maybe you could have a cartography skill that would add more stuff to your maps as your skill went up. Anyway that is all.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>  &lt;Why should you be able to see ANYthing that is out of your field of vision? &gt;<P>  Is this to mean that IRL, YOU can only see what's straight in front of you? You can't turn your head? Take a look around? <P>  I know when my Dark Elf stands still, he makes the motions of a person looking around. That is what this would imitate. Considering this is a perrilous world, with everyone and his dog scowling at you and ready to attack, it makes perfect sense that the player's character would be looking around. Over their shoulders. Making sure that a YounG Kodiak isn't about to trounce on them.<P>  I'm not asking for a huge range either, just something that is reasonably realistic.<P>AWM</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well back to the map idea it wouldnt be for the sake of navigation alone it would also address the problem of being surprised by mobs to some extent. For instance if you bought a map from someone it would have a list of all of the monster encampment locations.<P>So a map of Crushbone for example would have the castle on it with a note saying Dvinn and King in tower or something. Then if we had a cartography skill the higher the skill the more notes that would appear on your maps.<P>Hence this would be better then the sense heading skill, however it would not unbalance tracking in any way due to the fact that these maps are already available if you look online.<P>However I think it would be cooler to just ask around to see if anyone was selling a map in game then to have to log off and search dozens of websites for a map. Also I think it would add to the atmosphere of the game, it would get more people out to explore because<P>a) they may just want to make maps of all the zones and have them to sell<BR>b) they will have maps and feel a little more comfortable in otherwise unknown zones.<P>It could also be cool to map scars of velious when it comes out. Just think you could be like Amerigo Vespuci and maybe have a zone named after you or something if you were the first one to completely map all of Veliouses zones  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>Anyway what do you think of this idea?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The reason the radar works in AC is that (apart from the notorious Drains) all damaging spells are line-of-site. EQ has too many spells that don't need LOS to allow this to work. The radar is useful, but it's a bit unrealistic.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I would like to just see a regular compass on the screen. Say after you reach a skill of 100 sense heading, you would always have a small direction symbol in a corner of the screen. Just a simple N/S/W/E/NW/NE/SE.. etc. It gets annoying to run through zones constantly hitting a button to find out what direction you're going while avoiding mobs/objects.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Oooooh Camili I like that idea...  I currently have a sense heading of 125 and it never fails.  Now if my character has the ability to "Sense" her direction that well (i.e. human compass) why couldn't a "N" or "NW" appear up at the top, or next to the lag/loss meter...  The sense heading button system does work well, I'll admit that, but have you ever been running away from a monster, OOM with SOW going blinky on your screen, it's raining (SK usually) and you have 2 avo's on your tail, and you're trying to get to zone AND pay attention to your sense heading...<BR>C'mon Gordon, reconsider, it won't change game balance one bit and it would just be a nice feature.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I've always liked the idea of a compass that was dependent on your sense heading skill.  Heck, if the text output was parsed and a simple "N" (or whatever appropriate direction) was put up near the top of the UI when I pressed my little hotkey, that would be great.  I think because it is a skill that has to be raised, it would require you to actually continue to push the button.  On the other hand, the client could just simulate it anyway and as you go up in level it would automatically increase.  After level 10 or so, SH seems to be fairly consistent and at my current 165 or so, I just mash it when I level to keep it up with all my other skills.  <P>This is not a huge issue either way with me, but VI has seemed to be trying to make the UI more user-friendly.  I do not like having to switch to another bank of hotkeys, hit the button, figure out which way I'm going, then switching back to my normal hotbank.  <P>If the client handled it: at newbie levels you might see your heading flash up at the top every now and then, by level 20 (or whatever) you would have a fairly accurate compass, then by 35 it would be almost always on and accurate.  I don't think this would detract from the exploration vision, as by level 20 you should have a decent grasp on geography and learned how to go locate the information you need if traveling to new lands.  <P>Dador Caduceus<BR>Realm of Valor<BR>Mithaniel Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Abashi,<P>Your point is well taken and there are indeed serious drawbacks to adding this ability. But...<P>One of the reason that groups "camp" (sit in one place and pull mobs to them) rather than "adventure" (whole group moving from room to room exploring) is that it is an incredible pain to try to keep a group together in a dungeon. I cannot count the times that my group has said something like "let's move up to room x", we start to move out and people start to get lost. Part of the problem is the warping inherent in multiplayer games. One moment you are in front of me, next frame you are gone and I have no idea where. Next thing you know, the party is scattered all over, mobs are aggroing, trains are forming and people are dying.  <P>I know the response can be "well, this gives an advantage to well-organized teams" or "this is realistic" or "people find ways around it". All of which are true. BUT... it has the practical effect of making camping and pulling a much, much safer and rewarding game-play method than adventuring. And since it is more rewarding, it is much more likely that playes will do it that way. <P>The general comments I have heard in the past from Verant were that you guys were always looking to find ways to turn the game from "EverCamp" to a more exploration-like dungeon crawl kind of game. I would love for that to happen. But I cannot imagine how that is going to happen if it is as difficult to keep a party together as it now is. <P>I hope you guys reconsider it and perhaps try it on test. I think that just the ability to see where your teammates are will help so much that it will make up for the loss of "realism".<P>Thanks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I thought the original intent of this posting was to get something so you could see MOBs around you?  As an earlier post read..."IRL, can't you turn your head and look around?"  Well...yes.  In EverQuest, you can press F9 four times and get a MUCH bigger and better view than RL could ever afford.<P>I'm a low level character (14), and yesterday, because our party didn't have a lookout, we almost got smashed by a HG in West Karana.  Would it have been nice to see him on a little radar?  Yes, it would have been nice...but it would NOT have taught me and my party to keep watch.<P>This is a very good game as is, and I personally don't mind clicking on the Sense Heading skill whenever I need to...because it simulates me using CONCENTRATION on my skill...what's being proposed would eliminate that sense of realism and adventure.<P>2cps for anyone who cares...   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Cyron<BR>14th Enchanter<BR>Torvonnilous</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

At first it's a little unwieldy, but it gets better with time.<P>Or, just look around as you're fighting in an open area.
