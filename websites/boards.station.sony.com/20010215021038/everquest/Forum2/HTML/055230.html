</FONT><HR>I'm curious to know how many clerics on each server are backloged on their epic by this spawn? I know on Tarew Marr we have at least 17 clerics waiting on this insanly rare NPC to spawn. I might mention a spawn that is now camped 24/7 for days just to get one cleric their epic. The ill will between guilds at times vying for this spawn can get down right nasty.<P>Why must this spawn be on such a long timer? 24-72 hours at best guess. If anything the Overking in Chardok requires far more work, skill and preperation to kill. <P>Zordak Ragefire should be on the a fixed timer or spawn on the death of one of the Fire Giants. The only thing this part of the cleric epic does is cause lost nights of sleep and animosity between guilds over his spawn. Was this your goal Verrant?<P>Every other part of this epic is a camp fest from the named aquagoblin in Lake Rathe thru the named in Sol A. Days to Weeks are spent just getting to the point of killing Ragefire. Why must this part be a insane camp?<P>I'd like to hear comments from others on all servers that have help a cleric with this quest. What are your feelings on it?<P>BTW I'm not a cleric. Just a guy that's been helping my guild clerics work on thier epic. We have 3 ready for Ragefire and 5 more at verious stages of this quest. I'm not sure who it's more frustrating for, the cleric or the crew that waits those hours/days for quest NPCs.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is not so bad a problem on Morell-Thule.<P>Morell-Thule has only about 8 completed cleric epics so far, mostly due to the fact it is a fairly young server, and up until quite recently not a lot of guilds a tried Overking or Ixiblat Fer.  A couple of weeks ago our guild had 5 clerics needing ragefire, with 2 completed a month or two earlier, but unfortunatly other guilds have started reaching this stage as well.  We still need 2, mine included.  I think theres a few more clerics coming, but we've been waiting longer so we intend to take him.<P>This is going to become a real bottleneck, get in while you can because theres gonna be a queue a mile long.  It will take a while to get bad on younger servers though.<P>Khain<BR>RA<BR>Morell Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have to agree with False_Prophet on this one. This spawn is causing so many problems that I don't even know where to begin. The only part I have left on the epic is Ragefire, and already I have been bamboozled by guilt trips from other guilds about why their cleric deserves the spawn next. It is not fun for me to have to babysit a spawn 24/7 for up to 72 hours, where is the "questing" in that? <P>The problem is the larger guilds tend to monopolize the spawn, and just because I am not in a larger guild does not mean I should be denied because I don't know the people to watch a spawn for me while I actually get stuff done in real life.<P>The only solution I would see would be to increase the spawn time and make the loot rarer drops. 24-72 hours is absolutely ridiculous!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have to agree. So many of the quests seem to be well thought out and at least proactive. This isn't a quest - it's a long camp. And to put this last step as yet another camp is horrible, but what is worse is that the cleric can't just go and suffer through the camp alone like we have for so many of our quests. We have to have people with us, suffering as well. THAT was the worst part for me.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree.  This is a pretty ridiculous method for making something hard to get.  Surely VI can figure out some other way that is both challenging *and* entertaining.  This brings to mind the tag "Evercamp" and the threads and discussions on downtime.

</FONT><HR>I also agree.  The difficulty in the quests was supposed to be based around solving puzzles that involved many steps, having to work various factions along the way to be able to do parts of the quest (as if handing over 8000 bone chips is fun), gather enough other players to be able to take down the uber mobs required, etc.<BR>Hanging around all day, every day, for 3 or 4 days has no relation to fun.  And knowing that if you were to log out to say shower, your mob popped and someone else managed to snag it while you were away, is just maddening.<BR>Understand, Verant, that YOU play a role in how EQ effects peoples' Real Lives.  If you make it so that the FINAL step of an epic requires 3-4 days of SOLID camping, TAKE RESPONSIBILITY for how this effects the lives of others.  Understand that the game has a greater pull on some than on others, in an addictive sense.  Take a roll in mitigating this, not in denying your responsibility.  Where is the fun, the game, in sitting in front of your PC for 4 days, doing the same thing over and over and over, because you have no choice but to wait because you want this other mob to spawn?<P>/rant off</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree.  When the servers get big like TM is, and so many clerics are ready for this step at the same time, I imagine its even more stressful.  I mean, if you really want to get this item, you (and your guild/friends) literally have to sit in the same spot for days.  <P>It's one thing to sit there and let your Real Life go to hell for 3 days (or whatever the real spawn time is).  It's another to have to fend off the other big guilds that just might decide to get all powerhungry and take the camp away from you - even after you have sat there for days -- just because they think they are "more deserving."  <P>As everyone else has said, this isn't a test of gameplay (especially NOT clerical abilities).  This is a test of whether you can handle letting your Real Life fall apart enough to get this item - or whether you have enough friends willing to let their Real Life fall apart for 3 days while you actually get some sleep.  <P>What is the point of having the spawn be so long anyway?  <P>:confused</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well it does kinda suck, but imho second to rogues, clerics have the easiest epic quest.  Yeah the ragefire camp is slow and sucky, but at least you know where he pops.  Mages have it far worse with the earth staff situation off Inny, as well as the Quillmane spawn.  Wizzies have it really bad with the Cazic Skin drop.  <P>Though I would be happy to see every cleric out there with a Rez stick, your complaints about ragefire pale in comparison to the suffering some other classes have to go through to complete their epic.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>All of these epic mobs (vs, trak, cazic, inny, zordak, faydader) should be on a timer like they are now, with the additional 'spawn by turning in an epic piece'. <P>Every epic has steps in it that take time to complete, from the raid planning time alone. The folks who have taken the time to get that far in their epic quest deserve their epic items. It shouldn't be about sticking things on rare spawns to control the rate they enter the game, rather that the raids needed to complete an epic quest take months to organize and complete. <P>Will use ranger as an example, because it's the only one I am intimately familiar with..<P>1-2 groups needed for EK Corruptor/Reavers<BR>2-3 groups needed for Jade Reaver in City of Mist<BR>3-4 groups needed for the guy in the Hole<BR>5-6 groups needed for Venril Sathir<BR>5-6 groups needed for Innoruuk<P>If you guys at Verant are thinking that someone will be able to persuade their friends that they should bounce all over and complete most of these steps 'walk-through' fashion in a day, it just shows how out of touch with the players you are.<P>When you add the fact that a ton of the epic mobs are on a rotation, or just so unpredictable when they spawn that people get in screaming fits with each other when one does... Why have epic quests at all? It seems that you think that most people don't deserve to complete the quests, so why not take the quests out altogether, and award the epic items to whoever you DO think deserves them? That would be about as fair for everyone as the situation is now.<P>How about this.. Move the required epic pieces to new mobs that drop nothing but the epic item, on a daily, or 72 hour spawn that are just as hard as the mobs they are on now. That's all they drop, nothing else, no loot for anyone except the person doing the quest, and they can also turn in an item to spawn it.<P>An example is the Monk epic... Look at the major mobs in that quest, noone else needs/wants anything they drop, and they are entirely spawnable (or at least on a 2 hour timer). Whoever worked out the monkey quest got it right.. The other ones need some work.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yeah, monkey quest was good.  I enjoyed doin it...it actually had a cool storyline.  But don't forget questing for the robe.  3 things in that quest can and probably will take days of camping to get.  2 are pointless and boring for anyone of level to get the epic.  Qwinn in sk can take days (even have a monk in our guild who has been searching for him, and mind you he has trackers out there helping him, for 6 days now straight, with probably 8 hour days), and raster can take 100+ hours of just camping him sometimes...<P>But once you're passed the robe (and don't forget the pawbuster camp) it's a great quest.<P>Oh, and if anyone wants to complain about an epic, try the druid quest with faydedar.  At any one time you'll see 5 variations of "faydedarpharmer (lvl 1 dr00id) zone:timorous deep"<P>Now I've spent all day waiting for ragefire before, and we've had conflicts, but this camp is far better than many others out there so I don't see it being changed...especially since the result of the quest is so awesome.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>On over emphasizing the cleric epic.  Part of the reason for this is it is one of the few epics that benefits whole groups of players and not just one player.  As for looking at the makeup in our guild.  On TM, our guild has 2 rogue epics, 1 Monk, 2 Shaman, and 1 Cleric.  The cleric was by far the worst because of the Ragefire camp.  The other epics that are not complete are because the RL time requirements are beyond reasonable.  Verant thinks boring = challenging.  They are wrong.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You are right, but its not just ragefire, its every long spawn epic mob.  As soon as ragefire pops, you know there is a torrent of people rushing to solb to lay *claim* to him.  Just like as servers go down, you know people are rushing to camp in/outside hate/fear.<P>It is verant's flawed design which does nothing but cause conflicts between groups of people.  All we can really do is live with it and hope to get lucky sometime.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yes I have to agree with mstorrie and others that there simply are too many excessively long and boring quests.  For Zordak specifically I know my guild had to exchange phone and pager numbers just in case the guy spawned in the middle of the night (which he did).  Also, we had to keep a large percentage of the people nearby, just so another guild wouldn't jack him.  <P>Perhaps Verant doesn't think there's something wrong with people excessively disrupting their real lives for these quests?  I think it's a bit much when you have to take vacation days and ask many others to be on standby around the clock to do the same, just to get an epic.  Many of the epics require dedication, but not insane multi-day multi-person round the clock camps, that the others do.  With the number of clerics backed up waiting for the Zordak on my server, I have a minimum wait of two months, assuming of course they don't down the servers a lot, since he spawns randomly 1-3 days after Naggy dies.  <P>It's just not worth the hard feelings to keep the camp for days, along with making a whole lot of people change their lifestyles for a few days just for me.  And while my focus has been on the cleric FA, the druid one and others sound equally bad.  Difficult dungeon crawls are fine for the quests, sitting on your butt for days changes this from a fun game into a boring waste of time.<P>My 2c, have fun  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055230&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055230&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
