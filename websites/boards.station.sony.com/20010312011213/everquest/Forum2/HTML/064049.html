&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Guys...<P>I think you all have created a great game.  I'm sure you have also been well rewarded for your ingenuity and hard work.  I don't know if the size of those rewards have made you complacent like wealthy linebackers who seem to avoid taking the risks that were taken by their predecessors, but something has gone horribly a miss.<P>A little context.<BR>I am over thirty, married with kids, and work as an executive in a professional services company.  Now..that and 1.50 gets me a plain cup of coffee at Starbucks.  I include it only to explain that I am not some Kewl Dood out to define his self worth by a virtual personna in a MMORPG.  This game one of the ways I choose to unwind, unplug, from the demands of work and home.  Writing this open letter is not part of unplugging or unwinding...quite the opposite, but I have decided to invest this time.  What I ask is that you read and respond in this open forum.  If that doesn't convince you; my wife is really ticked that I spent all this time writing so a lack of response will mean if got in trouble for nothing ;-)<P>My career and the success of my company is predicated on a high degree of customer service.  I'm sure many of the 300,000+ subscribers you now serve have similar roles in the "real-world."<P>Please, do not get defensive, but in my humble opinion, your customer service is woeful.  "How can that be?  We have such a high retention rate.  Things must be pretty good."<P>Can you do queries on your user logs to determine how many of those accounts are still being used by original owners?  Here is my hypothesis.  Few accounts are truly canceled.  Many are either sold on Ebay or absorbed into a guild.  I know the guild with whom I play is supporting at least 1/2 dozen "canceled" accounts since they provide good utility in terms of "porting", "resurrections," "mez-on-demand," etc.<P>Many people who play your game are, quite frankly, addicted.  I do not disparage them but this subset of your customer-base is largely unaffected by poor customer service.  They will argue and complain, but do little else.  However, when a suitable alternative to your product is available, they will likely shift their addiction in that direction.  What about Ashron's call?  Quite frankly, that game, from what I hear, doesn't hold a candle to what EQ was (pre expansions)  It just wasn't good enough to peel away your customer base.<P>I think the major issues with the game came when you expanded the characters beyond lvl 50 in an enviornment that was never designed to support it.  You have major balance issues between melee and casters because of the wealth of melee items and the relative scarcity of both spells and caster items.<P>I am starting to delv into the minutia and that is not my intent so let me raise my points up a level.<P>I think you are doing a terrible job of communicating with your customers.  I am a customer and that is my perception.  Many here seem to have the same perception.  Perceptions of one's customers is reality...trust me it is.  Your customers feel you are adversarial with them.  They believe that you think they will destroy "your" game with their unbalanced ideas.  Perhaps you are right...but they (we) are the customers so how do you communicate your concerns while answering ours.<P>I'd like to offer a couple suggestions and then provide a small case-study to illustrate why the implementation of such suggestions (or ones similar) are needed.<P>I think Alan's idea for "Talk" threads was a good one.  That said, I do not believe Verant Management provided him the support or infrastructure to make that good idea successful.  This confuses me.  If Verant's data is accurate then you have approximately 300,000 active accounts which equates to about $3 Million dollars in revenue monthly plus revenue from the sale of retail boxes at $16 - $50 each.  Surely, even after expenses and R&D, there are enough funds to provide a robust and thoughtful customer support engine.<P>I suggest that one member of your current staff be assigned as advocate to each class.  Such a person should have as their mission in life to understand the wants and needs of that segment of customer.<P>Each class should have an interactive page on the EQ website through which to see a regularly updated status on their issues.<P>You might say that you already have such advocates as part of your tuning team.  Great!  Tell us who they are.  Have them engage us.  You don't know how lucky you are to have a vibrant customer base that WANTS to tell you what they think.  Most companies have to pay 3rd parties to find quasi-interested pseudo-customers who then provide their input...for a fee.<P>These 14 folks would, of course, also have to maintain the objectivity one would expect of a Verant employee as opposed to a purist player.  The "good-of-the-game" would temper the natural desire to advance the position of their advocacy group beyond what is reasonable.<P>The ideas put forth by the 14 would be managed similar to how Alan has started the "talk" threads, but much more actively so.  Part of this open communication would include time lines and thoughts in process.  I know companies think of their project plans as some kind of top secret document.  "We can't share that with our customers; what if we miss our projected timelines?"<P>I would just love to see the look on one of my customer's faces if I told them I would not share my team's project schedule.  Communicate with us; tell us what's up.  If you miss a date...so what.  It's a game to us, not a mission critical enterprise application.  Tell us why its going to be delayed and give us a new date.  You know, I bet dimes to donuts that if the high-powered healing items were discussed in an open forum, even in general terms so as not to ruin the excitement, the uncomfortable issues you now face would have been avoided.<P>So, to recap.  <BR>1) Verant employed, class specific, advocates.<BR>2) Such advocates are either members of, or have significant input to, the tuning team.<BR>3) All issues managed by advocates are communicated and over-communicated to the interested community via class specific, verant managed, web pages.<BR>4) Time lines for resolution to issues are published and any slippage communicated in a timely manner.<P>Now....perhaps I am just full of hot air.  Pehaps none of my issues have any validity.  Can I cite even one case example.  Why yes...yes I can.<P>Let us take the case of the Necromancer class.  I play this class and have since beta.  I have a upper mid 50s character and am biased as hell ;-)<P>Here is some history which most of us know.<P>Everquest is a grouping game where experienced is gained by vanquishing foes and such experience is shared among those participating.  If someone vanquished a foe by themself they got to keep all the experience.  Wow..that sounds like a great deal.  <P>And thus is born folks attraction to soloing characters.  Of the classes that could solo, Necromancers seemed to be able to do it best although many would argue that Druids solo better.  Even if that is the case, Druids' solo ability is due to player ingenuity rather than Verant design.<P>Necromancers advanced quickly through low and middle levels and jealousy developed among the other classes as they saw one class doing what it would take a group of them to do.  As is typical of human nature, they did not explore the situation and realize such abilities were quite situational.  Open areas...good fear pathing...undead only...etc.<P>Such was the Necromancer class' abilities in this area that pretty much everyone "hated them"  They were tuned to place their advancement in line with other classes.<P>1) Pet damage was reduced<BR>2) DoT damage was reduced in some situations<BR>3) Pet damage was further reduced when dagger speed changes were removed<BR>4) Post 50 pets were made more powerful than the 49th lvl pet by only the slighest of margins<BR>5) Post 54 creatures universally resist lifetaps at which point the entire class breaks down because its ability to restore health from mana conversion is disconnected.<P>Well...that's a lot of change there.  Perhaps too much, but some things were added too.  However, was the community ever asked if it wanted to become a benevolent giver of mana?  No.  Communication.  The hallmark of all my points above was woefully lacking.<P>The Necromancer community, of course, raised these issues.  Unfortunately most times in an immature and confrontational manner.  The other 13 classes, still smarting from the Necromancer of yesteryear were quick to raise the ante and call Necromancers overpowered and called for greater nerfs.  General ugliness ruled the day and continues to rule the day.<P>Fast forward to the recent past.<P>The creation of Epic items.  Great idea.  Was any focus group work done with the player base?  What would they really want?  What would truly be epic.  How would they balance that epic power with what was good for the game.  I'm betting this communication did not occur.  The result, most classes (&gt;7) are unhappy with this ultimate reward.  Some, Necromancers for example, are outraged.  Verant put a lot of time into these quests; I'm sure it wasn't easy to code.  Artists spent time creating textures and so on.  My gosh, why would you want to go to all that work only to have this "gift" rejected with such venom.  To be honest, the Necromancer epic item is both embarrassing to look at and has an effect of marginal usefulness.  This should not be able to happen in a well run, customer-centric organization.  To be blunt, if 90% of your customer segment believes you made an error in your product then you did.  You made an error in the necromancer epic and should just say so.  Trust your customers to, in turn, reply, "Thanks for telling us that, how can we help you fix the problem."  TRUST YOUR CUSTOMERS!<P>Dovetailing off the trust your customers comment, please consider the following true scenario where my guild was going to Chardok to obtain items for the Cleric epic mace.<P>Raid Leader:  Please do not use Ignite/Chill bones; it confuses the melee.<BR>Necromancer:  You realize it is my only DD<BR>Raid Leader:  I know; I'm sorry ;-(  Use your DoTs<BR>Necromancer:  The critters die in less than 10 seconds; they will do no good.<BR>Raid Leader:  Use your fast ones then<BR>Necromancer:  Ummm...my fastest is 45 seconds<BR>Raid Leader:  No way ;-(<BR>Raid Member:  Why not have him make a pet<BR>Raid Leader:  NO!!! Pathing is bad..pet will get us killed.<BR>Necromancer:  No DD, No DoT, No Pet.  What should I do; I want to help.<BR>Raid Leader:  This is going to suck, but give everyone DMF and give your cleric/enchanter the balance of your mana.  Sorry...<BR>Necromancer:  Ok...<P>Well that was how the raid went.  What can Verant do about that today.  COMMUNICATE.  State it.  Tell us, "Ok...there are some problems with your class.  We are committed to fixing them.  It will take some time.  Susan here is your primary contact at Verant and she will be working on your behalf.  We will get all your ideas down and then follow-up with some dates and next steps.  We will at least have the next steps posted for your feedback by date XYZ.<P>Guys...this is basic business here.  You will have amazed and delighted customers.  You will develop loyalty that will enable you to retain customers through the release of "the next best thing."<P>Brad...when was the last time you delighted a customer?  Why do people pay 2x as much to get a shirt at Nordstrom?  Because Nordstrom strives every day to delight every customer.  OMG..my dog ate my shirt and I have a meeting in Chicago; what am I going to do?  As your checking into your hotel all stressed out, the clerk hands you a package from Nordstrom with a shirt, your size, in it,having been told of your dilemma and expressing the item to the hotel at no additional charge.  This is not B.S. this happened.  If Macy's has a sale on shirts tomorrow; will you see me there; hell no!<P>Well, there you have it.  Largely stream of consciousness since I'm tired and irritated, which, Brad, is a far cry from delighted, I must say.<P>Now is the time for the long pants.  You three look at each other and decide if you are going to continue the way you have been going, or strive to delight your customers every day.  Even when they are being major pains in the ass.  These customers are the ones that put food on your tables, braces on your kids' teeth, and the Porches in your garages.  Talk to us.  Trust Us. Listen to Us.<P>For my part, I'd be glad to help in anyway I can.  Shoot me an e-mail; lets talk.<P>Best Regards,<BR>A Customer<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Customer service is largely dictated by the line of business the company has and the reputation it has. I work for a Fortune 500 company based in Austin TX. This company, which like Sony, could buy Verant with its loose change. Yet, I dela with irate customers on a daily basis who have come to expect a great deal from the reasonably small outlay they have spent on our product. It's incredible what our customers expect from us.<P>Now...let's look at EQ. Go into the in-game's chat channel sometime, General Chat or whatever it's called. About 50 to 100 people trying to play childish oneupmanship with a beleagured GM. If my company forced me to spend a shift doing this, I'd look for another job honestly.<BR>And, customer service is commensurate to the money invested in the product. Verant are virtually unknown outside the gaming industry and the odd few that have heard of them would not know that they are a Sony subsidiary. As such, they have no large scale reputation to cover. Sony makes literally billions more from its electronics and IT industries than from Verant. As such, their customer support has nothing really to offer the buying public in general. They expect to deal with "gamers" rather than corporate IT heads, business executives, purchasing officers like my company does and they could argue you are getting what you are paying for in $9.95 a month. Also, there's a good chance their CS is outsourced and as such can't take the company's interests to heart as well as a "true" employee would.<BR>In other words, their expectation of customers is a lot lower and they have set their sights equivalently.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok..so I have a couple more minutes.<P>Wewal...I agree with your points, but not necessarily with the context in which you made them.<P>I am not concerned with Veran't CS as it relates to product disbursement efficiency.  We all remember the problems with Kunark shipments, yet I did not bring them up.  Why?  Because Verant communicated quickly and crisply that mistakes had been made and that they were working to fix them.<P>I am also not concerned with in-game support.  I find that fair to good and Verant has the benefit of a small army of volunteer player/guides to help out.<P>It is customer service as it relates to game design and mechanics that I find woeful.  With that aspect broken the other two don't much matter.  Game design IS Verant's business.  How it designs the game is within its control.  The value of the Verant brand in contrast to that of Sony is largely irrelevant, IMHO.  If Verant wants to be a premier game designer, it needs a solid feedback loop.  It needs to listen to its customers and develop a context in which such customers feedback can be trusted as well.<P>I outlined some ways to accomplish that in my novel &lt;grin&gt; above.<P>The only way a small unrecognized company gets to be a large, admired company with significant brand equity is by listening to its customers and giving them what the want.<P>Best regards,<BR>A Customer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Darkwen,<P>To nip this in the bud.  All of us play some character.  Therefore all of the things with which we agree and disagree revolve around those character(s)' issues.<P>If I had no design issues with the class I played, there would be no reason to write anything.  But my issues have more to do with the way input from all class communities is treated than with mine in particular.<P>I clearly stated my characters' class and my inherent biases.  I neither demanded nor suggested changes to that class; rather I suggested a construct that would benefit all customers in having their feedback both heard and managed.<P>Please please do not let this degrade into a class bashing post.  It is not that.  We all deserve input into game mechanics and I wanted to point out that it is also in Verant's best interest to do so as well.<P>Best regards,<BR>A Customer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Whenever a Druid/Wizard/Cleric leaves the game they almost always get picked up by a friend to port and rez. It happens all the time.<P>Further, notice the poster didnt claim to have done so himself, simply to be in a guild where this is going on.

</FONT><HR>Well written post with excellent points. Especially about the Epic weapons - for the amount of work that went into creating them, they should have been better thought out. I will give Verant credit for steadily trying to improve - it's just that results often come across as "hit and miss". Alan's class talks were a good idea, but came across as very rushed and may likely prove to be unsatisfying for all involved. The notion of "class champions" is a good one.<P>Be interesting to see what happens as some of the other MMORPGs hit the market. I'm sure it's an incrediable balancing act to create a game with the long-term adictiveness of EQ, and I suspect competitors will have a tough time meeting or beating it. But I'm eagerly awaiting finding out.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Second, he said that if they told their customers the truth about what they intended to do *before* they did it and got feedback from their customers that that would count as listening and make the game better.

They were created in that veign when this game was a far different game. <P>They release Kunark and Velious and up the levels to 60. They require grouping in most situations. General HPs and Damage dealing of mobs doubled and tripled while necro "solability" was raise only by the slightest margins. <P>People used to look to the necro with hatred and jealousy, as it was designed and actually says in the original guide book. You will be hated by everyone, and other players will fear your power. <P>Not anymore. <P>The one greatest advantage to playing a necro in the high lvls is that on big guild raids, there are so few necros around that Necro gear ends up being a lotto of 1. Sad. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
