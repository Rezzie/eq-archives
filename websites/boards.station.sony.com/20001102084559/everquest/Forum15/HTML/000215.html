</FONT><HR>Bards use to be amazing. We could fill in for almost any class at a moments notice plus we could regen hps and mana. Bards were welcome in any group because we could contribute.<P>After Kunark came out, things changed. The same level mobs hit harder and faster and had more hitpoints. Higher level mobs were even more powerful. Now, groups need a cleric to heal and an enchanter to do crowd control and after this latest patch, haste before even thinking about heading in deep to any Kunark dungeon.<P>I do not see where a bard fits into a balanced grp. We used to be able to balance a group but now you have to have a balanced group just to survive. The only two things I can do now is pull and regen (hps and mana). I can't help out the enchanter with crowd control because my mez songs are broken and can not be overwritten by an enchanter's mez. You say that a bard's mez would be too powerful if it had no secondary resist because it consumes no mana. Verant do you realize an enchanter can keep four mobs mezzed indefinitely? Why can't a bard keep two mobs mezzed indefinitely? Since you "fixed" the haste bug, my melee is extremely poor because I would never roll on high-end haste item.<P>What can I do for my group? Really one thing, mana and hp regen. Bards can pull extremely well but why should we when any lvl 60 can pull SINGLES from a camp of low blue mobs. It kinda makes OS a joke. hehe. Pull a path and then only pull phs for the rares.... I guess I can just wait until I am 60 and be the pulling, regen man.<P>You are slowly killing off bards. There is really no need for us. A necro, druid, mage, or actually almost any non hybrid would be a much better choice. Our songs aren't powerful enough to make our group THAT much better.<P>We still play because we don't want to start over. I think I know your plan. You want everyone to get a second account and use their bard to powerlevel their new enchanter, cleric, or warrior. Do you know what I use my bard for? Powerleveling my warrior and enchanter on my other account!<P>How do I think a bard could become a welcome addition again? Three things. Kill the secondary resist on our two targetable mez songs and make our mez songs overwriteable. We would still be nowhere near as powerful as an enchanter but we could help. Last thing, make our haste songs stackable with haste spells. This would help our party receive max haste.<P>If the above changes where made a bard could actually contribute instead of take away from a group. I would be hearing tanks scream for us because the enchanter and myself could take him to max haste. Enchanters would like the extra help on those 5+ mob pulls. And of course any mana user would love that extra bit of mana.<P>Verant, you can not say these changes would imbalance the game. Why? Here is why.<P>1. Everyone with a haste item has been at max haste since the beginning. Kunark was tuned with players at max haste. You said many many many times that the game was balanced with everyone at max haste.<BR>2. You claim enchanters are the king of crowd control. An enchanter can keep 4 mobs mezzed forever. An echanter can keep 2 mobs mezzed forever, buff clarity, buff augment, and throw in a nuke and still gain mana. A bard should be able to keep two mobs mezzed forever while doing nothing else. Enchanters will still be the king.<BR>3. It is not like half the server is a high level bard. There is less than 10 bards over 50 on emarr. It would not imbalance the game having 10 bards being able to do what I mentioned above. Keep in mind that bards below 50 can contribute in other ways.<P>I hope you see my point. Bards just want to be contribute again.  Adding a couple of group friendly abilities to bards would give us bards the uniqueness we desire.<P>Mackentil Dapuller<BR>55 Bard<BR>Erollisi Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>You have to adjust to every situation that is thrown.<P>We don't do enough damage, but our songs can help more than you think.  Recently I've been in Lower Guk, we get an average of 2 mobs per pull (Monk).  Into the room, Enchanter Mez, I play trusty Melodic Binding ... contrary to popular necro mith this DOESN'T break mez ... necro mez is just not really good.<P>It slows the mob down a lot, on a monk pull the puller will get hit the most (unless a warrior is there to taunt).<P>I binned Bellow.<P>Mez isn't the only use of a bard, I still fight with the rest of them, rarely take damage if with a monk/warrior/paladin and that is with a SSOY.<P>I've never failed to get a group in a zone like SolB/LGuk and in Karnor, I've only been rejected once because I was to low a level.<P>Just my opinion, it would be nice to be able to mez a couple of mob ... but it's not the end of the world.<P>Khelor 45th Bard of Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well, try and play a bard post 55 and see. You are not good at anything except to play the mana song and buff the AC some. We all know that stats suck so there is little/no use doing those songs.<P>Try and say to your group that you will do the slowing and hasting when you are in the disco room (OS) for instance... or maybe that you will take care of the adds.<P>Good luck.<P>/A lvl 58 mana battery</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Verant really needs to start looking at what they are doing to hybrid classes by both nerfing character abilities and making Kunark so difficult at high levels. By making the anchor classes (warrior, cleric, enchanter) so necessary it makes the hybrid classes less and less valuable as group members. At a certain point, the marginal utility of adding a hybrid, compared to the potential value of adding a pure class (particularly one of the anchor classes), becomes so low that people just don't want a ranger or a bard, for instance.  Sure, the ranger can add some melee damage, and the bard could add some mana regen, but a second warrior, or a second enchanter, or even a necro (much more damage than the warrior) or wizard (unresistable DD, evac), etc., adds so much more to a group that you really only take a hybrid if there is no other option.<P>It really doesn't make for a fun game to know that you are only being added to a group because there is nobody else available.  Verant needs to keep in mind that subscriber numbers are not the only indiciation of customer satisfaction - I know for a fact that many of the high level players in my guild only continue playing for social reasons, and many of us have no intention of buying another Verant product and building up similar social ties if the current mismanagement of class balance and PvE issues continues.<P>P.S. I have no idea if opining that Verant is mismanaging class balance and PvE issues violates the posting rules here. Sadly enough, I'm so dissatisfied with the product that Verant is producing that I'm willing to post this anyway in the hope that Verant pays attention, even if there is some risk in doing so.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Verant claims time and time again that they don't want bards being mana batteries. Well, that is exactly what they are doing to us. I have had requests for the "mana song" since level 8!! I'm only level 25. At least once a level, someone wants the mana song. You know what Verant, take away everything else, and give me the mana song at level one. That way I would have know what I was getting into.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
