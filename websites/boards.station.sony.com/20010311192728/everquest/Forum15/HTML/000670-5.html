</FONT><HR>Just one little wish list thing to post although I went off on people posting wish list stuff, this one might just be kinda nice to have and add to out uniqueness... give sk's an innate ability to gain a slight amount of hp back each time they hit their opponet maybe something like ((lvl/10)/100) which would basically scale it from around .001% (i think, im tired so math may be off) at lvl 1, to around 6% at lvl 60, this isnt really a huge amount just a nice little bonus to maybe throw sk's, but if this would be given to us then have us told were balanced as theres many more pressing issues for us than little "bonuses" like this such as giving us the ability to be desired in raids</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>All I have to say is this<P>You need to do something about our offensive.<BR> Sure I dont think we should match a warrior or even close to it but by god I think we should be able to hit something. I though I was bugged for like 6 months because I was killing things 30 levels lower than me and would miss more than half my swings and lord have mercy if I was fighting something 10 or fewer levels lower than me when I did manage to hit it was for pathetic amounts. I called GM's and guides in all the time asking why I am missing so much. and all they would say is well its ok that you swung 84 times and hit 42 times you did hit once for 80 points I mean comeon I am level 55 and use a 28 damage weapon I should be able to hit more than 12 points of damage at time and shouldnt miss 14 times in a row you know how pathetic that is?<P>All this other stuff sounds ok I guess but I could really care less I just want to be sorta effective in a group if I would have known now what I known when I started I would never had made a SK.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>To be effective at the highest levels,one or more of the following must happen:<BR> <BR>1) SK's get more accurate at swinging a sword. Viola,they're now another second-rate tank. Whoopie. SK's end up being able to whack the monster once in four,maybe.<BR> <BR>2) SK's get more effective with spells. Spells are cast faster and stick better,though are significantly weaker by virtue of being gotten at higher levels.<BR> <BR>3) SK's get better defense. We still can't hit the broad side of Vox with our weapons,and our spells still blow chunks. OTOH,we can hold a mob down while the rogue and warrior are busy. Bash and shield discs fall under this.<BR> <BR>4) SK's get better opponents. Where are all those undead that should be humbled before the dark knight? Those supernatural foes that mere warriors cannot face? Paladins and SK's are the ones that are supposed to face the extraordinary foes that simple steel cannot turn aside,only magic and faith. Add in monsters that fear only magic spells and dark powers(OK,and all those namby-pamby light powers too) but laugh at mere weapons(though not what they proc).<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If I could have my wish list to balence SKs (without stepping on the warriors), I would do the following:<P>1)  Add the ability for hybrids to bash / slam interupt unstunable mobs (in order to stop mobs like Trak from gating).<P>2)  Give SKs the level 44 necro mana transfer (in order to allow us to contribute in a small way to downtime reduction).<P>3)  Add 10 to our defense cap, and 10 to our offense cap (keeping us still below warriors, but higher than we are now).  Alternately, I would take 12 - 15 to defense and no offense.<P>4)  Reduce casting times of SK spells, sort of like is currently on test, but perhaps less extreme (IE, instead of an across the board reduction, pick out the combat spells that actually need it and reduce to cerca 3 sec, + or - 1, CT).<P>5)  Fix Leachcurse to what it should have been in the first place, and currently is on test--hit every time for the 20 seconds, and get the healing.<P>I think that, together, these things would balence the SK class nicely.  <P>Numbers 1) and 2) together would make us more needed on raids and on uber mobs, without trying (vainly) to compete with a warrior in the ability to tank said mobs (it's not like we are tissue paper atm anyway).<P>Number 3) would generally increase our tanking and offensive ability across the board (without stepping on any warrior toes, as our caps are still less than theirs).<P>Number 4) would address the problem that many of our spells are basicly useless in combat, due to long casting times and interupts taking more melee damage than the spells would do.<P>(A more limited aproach to CT reduction, however, would keep weird things from happening, like Hybrids being faster casting all spells than their parent classes--IMO, CT reduction should apply to battle spells only.)<P>Number 5) would make our level 60 disc something worth using, without nearly making it overpowerful.<P><BR>Taken *together*, I think these would balence the SK.  On the other hand, I firmly believe that something like Defensive or unresistable Lifetaps (while I would *love* to have them) would overpower the SK.  If Verant feels differently and gives them to me--well, I won't complain.  But I doubt they will, so I am going for something more realistic.<P>Gruulgrul Nomesqusher<BR>58 SK<BR>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi absor, you asked for a updated respsonse and some corrections. I am a troll gravelord who got his lvl before your "xp" fix. I am bitter about that but np.<P>1.Most important Issue<BR>&gt;Ability to tank /affect big uber raid mobs.<BR>I am not sure what changes you have made on test to affect our ability to contribute in a fight against such mobs. The increase defense cap is great but much mroe is needed particularly to the parry,riposte,dodge caps. Our melee is the only thing we can use in such a fight because the design of these mobs mean no pure caster except a wizard can affect such mobs. Hence all a hybrid spells are unused, we did not have the use of such abilities going to a fight either since the defination of such a raid means all our spells are overridden.<P>&gt;All thats left is our melee ability be it tanking or damage dealing. Since verant has envisioned us to that of a defensive tank( which many Sks disagree ) then we will need the defensive AC cap and the defensive skill caps to be raised. We will still lose out to a warr due to hp, equipment concerns but we do need the raised caps. Even then this is not enough because the power of such mobs mean that without a defensive discpline we cannot tank such mobs. Thus the need for a porper defensive discipline which mimics the power of the warrior discipline Defensive. For your info, Defensive lasts 3 minutes, recycles at lvl 60 every 30 mins and totally mitigates all melee damage done to a warrior by 40%. It also decrease his melee output by a slgiht amount, estimated around 10%. Basically it turns a 850 point mob into a 550 poin mob, giving the clerics a chance to heal the tank before he keels over.<BR>&gt;&gt;That is what we SKs are asking for, something around that mark. Currently Leechcurse our lvl 60 discipline which lasts for 20 seconds and has a recycle time of 45 minutes, does nothing. It heals at best estimates around 600 points of melee damage over 20 seconds against a Boss type mob. Now as you can see 600 points is nothing to a mob who quad hits for 850 points, 600 points is also optimal because our low capped melee means that we tend to miss or do less damage against a boss type mob diue to our low skill caps. Since our Harmtouch and our lvl 55 discipline does not change the ability of the mobs to totally resist( ie at lvl 55 the typical boss mob is immune is most magic and disease based spells ) , we struggle to bring a equal contribution to such a fight. Not lag, latency, are common when u try to squeeze 30 plus ppl in a small area fighting one mob.  Evidence is easy to find of this and some Guilds now require the person requesting entrance to ahve a broadband connection because of the mass LDs common to such a fight.<BR>&gt;So please give us something we can use in such a fight. And it has to be melee related. It has to be as useful as Defensive.Or its useless.<P>2.Secondary concerns<BR>&gt;2hander vs 1 hander use. Currently many SKs use 1 handers because the ability to bash and the AC bonus a shield gives is overwhelming the small increase in melee damage a 2hander will give. More importantly if you see, most SKs use KUNARK 1handers because all the 1handers for SKs coming out from velious are frankly crap. An example , a Named in Temple of Veeshan was kill and he dropped a no drop SK only weapon. It stats were 20/30 weight 12 , no stats. No cinsider it took 40 of the finest to kill such a dragon. Now consider the Mace of Shadowed Souls which can take 1 group to get. It stats are 19/29 weight 2.6 plus 10 int bonus. Can you say totally screwed??? or how about this, Dark SPear of Venom 17/27 some stats , , a relatively easy quest to do for an SK in velious. It can be done solo even....How can a weapon coming from a encounters 10000 times tougher producce such a poor reward???<P>&gt; Bash plus the ability to stun. Sks and paaldins long have shared the ability to stun their opponents. It was considered one of our premium abilities. But now comes veilous many mobs cannot be stunned thus making our contribution negligible..<P>&gt;Spell casting concerns, i am indifferent to this as it does not address the ability of SKs at the highest lvls.<P>&gt;Armor issues, all classes have armor issues, some races inparticular have equipemnt issues, tis too vast to be covered.<P>3.unimportant issues.<BR>Grim Aura, Archery cap,Summon Corpse, mana transference does nothing to make out class more useful. it is a simply fact that the Attack number given is not a useful indicator of how high a melee characters ability to deal damage is. <P>&gt;Level, weapon delay and haste are greater factors, Grim aura does not help a low lvl sk and certainly wont help a high lvl one. Unless it gives a whooping 50 attack. <P>.Archery is useless. Please do not even worry about this. We hsve spells we do not need archery.Knights in plate armor should not go prancing around with Bows.Crossbows maybe..<P>&gt;Summon corpse,ermm ppl do not grab a SK for a group or a raid because of his ability to summon corpse.<BR>&gt;Mana Transferance spells. NO self respecting SK wants to be a mana whore to the clerics..<P>3. Interesting concerns.<BR>&gt;for the sake of RPG value, many SKs would like voice graft and a skeleton illusion . It doesnt change the pwoer of the class, its for fun and its of rpg value. I do not see the harm. Please absor do not suggest that giving skel illusions infringes on another classes ability ( necro or chanter ). Warriors have been sharing the ability to use just about most of the Sks offensive and utilisation spells on their weapons and equipment IE Boil Blood,Darkness, see invis, Invis etc.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Some of this list looks good, some of it puzzleing (archery?) and one thing very disappointing.<P>I spent 3 hours camping summon corpse spell and even died doing so due to a freak set of circumstances.  Part of the game, no problem right?  Now you are looking at taking it out?  VI just put it in!!!  I am a 50+ SK and finally after enduring the hard life of an SK (proudly w/o complaints from me) we are thrown a bone to allow us to help out our necro brothers and sisters and summon the corpses of our guildmates and friends in a pinch.  We never get the upgrade that necros get at 57, which is how is should be.  However, I was thrilled to get this addition and I will be VERY DISGUSTED if it is removed.  It would be bad enough if it was a spell we had to buy from a vendor, but I camped this spell on the Ishva before it became common knowledge that it was dropping off other mobs.<P>I hope you will take into consideration that the vocal minority is not always echoing the feelings and desires of an entire class, or even the majority.  This is the first time I have ever posted here on these SK threads, but I felt very strongly about this taking away of something that in no way unbalances our class and allows us to help, in a very SK role-playing way, our guildmates and friends.<P>The coffin weighs 10 stones, doesn't fit in a bag, and is not easy to get (if you are deep in a dungeon), and costs 162pp (with my charisma).  I can't imagine any valid argument that this spell unbalances our class.  The necros in my guild are thrilled I have it because they aren't on all the time and sometimes cannot get to where a corpse needs to be summoned due to other gaming obilgations.  Some classes scream any time they feel the least bit threatened, but to cry foul when your dark brothers/sisters are finally given something to make them a little useful is just pathetic IMO.  We are after all supposed to be 25% necro.<P>Absor, I apprecaite your attention to our class and I hope you will take my comments along with your list regarding summon corpse.  <P>Thank you!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Shadow knights need the same parry, dodge, riposte as well as defense as warriors. We are DEFENSIVE, so being less defensive than warriors makes no sense- Especially when our offensive is weak. Why do rangers get the same offense AND weapons skills as warriors and sk's get just defense? Why to sk's have the same defense as a bard for pete's sake? I don't think verant has helped sk's enough. <P>choklo 55 sk brell</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>There are some interesting changes proposed, but I think there are some other items to address:<P>1. Pets.  These are still an issue.  I must admit that once upon a time I liked the idea of having pets.  But now I have joined the other camp.  First, they can't be used in so many places.  So you put a certain portion of our power into the fact we have one, but we can't use it everywhere.  Could we trade the pet for something more universal?<BR>Second, we are fighters, why would we summon a weak fighter for us?  Maybe the pet should be a caster!   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>And finally, it doesn't fit many people's vision of the SK.  Everyone has a slightly different take on it, vampire/knights, evil killing machines, etc.  I tend to view the SK as a win-at-all-costs, no quarter type character.  They will fight dirty, use poison, disease, tap life, fear, use darkness and anything else they can summon to win.  And I think they would be loners, not tromping across the countryside with their faithful pet Jabober!  So maybe remove pets and replace them with more poison and disease dots, or even maybe a few weak poison DD.<P>2. Pets, the alternative.  Ok, if you insist we keep them, you can buff them, up their power a bit or do whatever you want.  The one thing I personally still want to see, and I know a lot of others would as well would be to make them con AT OUR LEVEL.  That would allow us to actually summon one in a dungeon without attracting hordes of green trash to us.  It would help to make them more universal, and I might add, group-friendly (how many groups let you SKs make a pet in a dungeon, show of hands please?).<BR>Other pet classes don't have this problem because they create pets near their level.  Only SKs have this problem.  So to solve it, when a mob cons our pet, let it see our level instead.  Or if you feel that makes it too easy, at least make our pet con at the level we get the spell.<P>3. Archery.  I don't know about others, but I really don't care about this skill.  It is class defining for rangers, for Paladins it is good for pulling, but we have spells for pulling.  What good does archery do me?  And I really don't see a dark knight with a bow.  Maybe you could remove this skill entirely and give us something more in line with our role, like improve disarm (make it useable), or one of the many shield-based skill proposals.<P>4. Skeletal form.  Nice idea, but I still like the idea for SKs of a look more like a spectral.  It would be a new look, so not infringing on any other class's look.  Call it Phantom Form or something like that.  With effects similar to the enchanter werewolf form (ie. VE as part of the form).  It would be nice to still look like yourself, but in a semi-transparent, spectral sort of way.<P>5. Casting times.  I am glad we are finally getting some faster casting, but it comes very late and seems too little.  Could we maybe have a skill/discipline to make us fast casters?  Since we have a small selection of lower powered spells to choose from, is it unreasonable to assume that we may learn to cast them quickly since we use them all the time?  I cast spells necros haven't used for a long time.  Maybe my long use of them makes me better at casting them?  I can see this is the line of reasoning you are getting at with the change, I would just introduce it earlier (maybe starting at 39) and ramping it up to maybe 50% at 60 instead of 30% (making our longest spell a 3 second cast).<P>6. Spell upgrades.  Things like VE at early levels don't last long.  For most classes, self buffs are usually upgraded every so often with longer lasting versions.  Could we either have an "upgrade" to some lower spells like siphon strength, VE, etc for longer duration, and maybe greater effect, or at least have their duration scaled with our level (eg. VE lasts 2 minutes at the level it is acquired, but lasts 20 minutes at level 60).  It's just annoying to have to mem spell, cast, unmem all the time.<P>7. Self buffs.  This one I find a little annoying.  Don't get me wrong, "draining" AC, ATK, etc is nice.  Makes me stonger, and makes the mob weaker for everyone attacking it.  However in practice I don't have the mana and open spell slots to cast all these spells all the time.  So they end up getting used as a SELF-BUFF.  So, I shadow vortex, siphon strength, etc on the first mob, and don't bother with subsequent ones, saving my mana for heart flutter, heat blood, etc.  It might help if these are made proc effects (like VE), or just a buff, or the mana cost decreased.<P>8. Summon Corpse.  Why shouldn't we have this spell?  We can locate corpses, we are supposed to have special knowledge about the dead.  If I can find your corpse why can't I summon it?  I don't see this as overpowering or anything, and the cost and weight of components means we won't be running around offering summon services.<BR>The comparison to the Paladin situation is correct.  Giving them res didn't infringe on Cleric ground.  And they even get an upgrade, we don't get the improved spell (though that would be nice).<P>9. Piercing.  Yes, raise it with the other skills.  I don't understand why this is lower, and in fact I do use daggers from time to time.<P>10. Damage.  I know I'm not the only one wanting to do more damage in melee.  If that just isn't in the cards, then maybe our damage spell lines should be upped and we can switch to being casting tanks.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>11. Harm Touch.  I like the idea of this being a tap.  It would put it in line with our other spells and make it the supreme tap we get.  It would also be useful as a last chance spell.  If a fight is being lost, you let off HT, which taunts the mob onto you, hurts it a lot, and heals you enough to be able to tank it a bit longer while your party evacs or whatever.<BR>I also think changing the HT discipline is in order.  You could call it Death Touch and make it work like the other high level caster insta-kill spells.  It would allow you to instantly and irresistably kill ANYTHING (ok, maybe almost everything, might be hard to justify that you can insta-kill Cazic Thule).  But the corpse poofs and no experience is gained (and in PvP, none lost).<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Oh, forgot one last thing.  Damage shields.  I don't know why we never had one, and now that we do it is acquired so late and does so little.<P>Like I said before, the SK to me is like a dirty fighter, not fighting fair, using disease, fear, poison, and your own strength against you.  Doesn't this sound like someone who would use a shield that hurts you every time you hit?<P>I can see a Paladin not having one, not having a lot of offensive spells, because he is "good".  He wouldn't cheat, and when you ask for mercy, he would grant it.  This is clearly not us.  I think it is also another good example of why SKs really are offensive in nature.<P>Think about your first encounter with a mob that had a damage shield.  Didn't you fear it just a little more than the others?  Didn't it seem a little like it was cheating?  Yet we have druids and rangers running around with them, yet SKs don't?<P>I think Banshee Aura should be moved a good ways down the spell list, maybe to 39, at least to 49.  And then an upgrade that does more damage added (or maybe just add a damage component to one of the shroud spells).<P>Or better, and more in line with our type of damage, give us a damage shield that is a lifetap (sounds kind of like our discipline eh?).  What if Banshee Aura tapped for 12 instead of inflicted 12 damage?  Then we would just need a lesser spell for earlier in the spell list.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A comment on one specific change that went in with today's patch: The pet buff.<P><BR>Overall it's pretty neat, but one thing in particular about it needs to be changed: The duration.<P>It only lasts 10 minutes, which is way way too short. It is horribly annoying trying to keep this buff on a pet, especially with the recast on it being 30 seconds, which means it takes 30 seconds for the spell gem to pop up after we mem it.<P>I would recommend a duration of 30 minutes or so for this spell, which would make it much less anoying to use.<P><BR>One other change I would possibly make to it would be to increase the strength buff that it gives to the pet, maybe to around 15 or 20 by the time the caster is level 30 or so. The pets swing faster now, but they still miss a majority of the time, the extra str would hopefully lower the miss rate.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>regarding: Innoruuk's Curse<P>Change Name?<BR>although not all shadowknights worship Innoruuk, the name of the weapon depicts its origin, not who can use the weapon. to change the name would require a major change to the story that follows the quest.<P>Fix Proc?<BR>the Proc on Innoruuk's Curse is a life drain damage over time spell. 50hps per tick, max of 250. the spell will refresh itself. BUT, it does not stack or overwrite any other heal over time type spells. specifically, it will not allow Celestial Light to stick; this causes a problem for clerics that need to heal efficiently. Because EVERY shadowknight that manages to go through an extremely difficult quest to acquire Innoruuk's quest, one would be hard pressed to get him/her/it to put it down and use a lesser weapon just so they can be healed effectivly.<P>Eevil 56.71 Revenant - E'ci</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Precious few of us are mad about the pre-51 SK situation,friend. It's the POST 50 population that's got troubles,since that's where the melee gaps and magic resistance boosts make us ineffective.<BR> <BR>Any fixes that go in may help us at lower levels,but only insofar as they should lead up to things that allow SK's to be useful members of groups at the highest levels. Which is,until recently something not even close to being a reality.<BR> <BR>The Hate changes do wonders for increasing the "intelligence" of mobs. Cheal is now like placing the crosshairs on the cleric,and superior is almost as good a "taunt".<BR> <BR>Now that monsters will actually attempt to pulverize healers at that level again(huzzah,I say-now monsters aggro on healers at all levels) we can see a reduction in raw power-which will benefit all the secondary tank-types,including us.<BR> <BR>If the monster doesn't sit there and let clerics chain-heal without jumping them,party total lifespan drops. Hence,to achieve the same results,the mob no longer needs to inflict damage capable of incinerating anything short of a warrior on Defensive with a cleric rapid-firing heals into him to be a threat.<BR> <BR>What a concept! And our taunt capacity makes us more useful in this case-even if debuffs have lessened taunt,we still have Disease Cloud,Boil Blood,and the Darkness lines working just fine.<BR> <BR>If Verant fails to nail the high-end monsters with a nerf stick as well,then we're back to figuring out what needs to be done to get 50+ SK's back on track....<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok.  I don't have much time or much different to say than what's already been said.  I'm just putting another vote in for what needs to be done.<P>I've always thought we got ripped off oh our spells.  A cross between a warrior and a necro.  Well, if that's so, then i got crossed between the cross eyed warrior and the handicapped necro.  I can't hit anything and my spells are worth jack.<P>I defintately think that 2hs should get some sort of bash.  I, like many other SK's, think of myself as offense.  I'm not gooing to carry a shield because you think I should play defense.  If you can't give us a bash with out 2 handed sword, can you give us a punch or something with that free hand when its not on the sword?<P>Spells spells spells.  Alright, if I wanted every spell in the book, I'd be a caster.  I'm not asking for that.  I'm asking for a unnerfed spells and a little sooner too.  I think everyone thinks that the disease line is a good idea too.  I'm fighting burynais which are blue to me right now and can only land half my spells.  That's only if Cazic-Thule is on my side that day.  Just imagine what it was like when i grouped and was at the sarnak fort.  *shakes his head in embarassment*<P>Even at this level (17) my group members are asking me if I plan on doing anything and helping out.  We're not warriors but come one... it's made so i cant hit a tired fly with an over-sized fly swatter in the middle of winter in alaska.<P>Pets... I don't know what to say about these because I never use mine.  He's so useless I'd rather sell the bone chips then waste them casting.  True, you don't really use pets to group.  Again, you're almost forcing me to play the way you think i should be played.  I spend the majority of my time soloing to level faster so i can group with my friends who are almost double in levels.  I'm getting there, but having to group as a useless defensive tank doesn't help.<P>Recap:<BR>More spells possibly but at least stronger and maybe earlier.<BR>Better hit ratio.<BR>Maybe a good punch in place of bash for us 2 handed users.<BR>Useful, non bone chip wasting pets.<BR>I think the cosmetic ideas are cool too.  I love this game and think it would be better if it were more in depth.  If making it so involves changin the names of swords, cool.  Changing the looks of shields is great because it makes us stand out.<P>That's about it for now.<P>Thanks for your time.<P>Mannajax<BR>17th Shadow Knight<BR>The Scaled Brotherhood</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Also posted this on the PvP (Part 3) thread...<P>--------------------------------------------------<P>Absor, I do truly hope you read this far. Anyways, although this post with an SK-only concern, I have posted it here because it really only is a concern on PvP servers. I have been playing an SK from the moment EQ went into Beta 4, and on TZ since the day that server went live... just so as you read the following you can know its an informed opinion.<P>HARM TOUCH<P>First, I am the first to agree that the reduction in PvP damage via HT is a GOOD thing in general. HT had become too powerful, expecially at higher levels. Circumstances had flooded in of Lvl 60 SKs being able to "auto-kill" casters. Harm touch in essence became Death touch. The 12% decrease (from prior to the patch) in HT damage in PvP still allows HT to be as viable in PvP as it was before the damaged was upped, while allowing it to be more useful still in PvE.<P>However, the change I do feel needs to be looked at it the fact that HT will no longer respawn upon death. In my (almost) 2-years of playing EQ, and since TZ has opened, I perhaps have heard, let alone seen, of maybe only 2-3 incidents where SKs bind-rushing another and HTing them was a problem. However, I am willing to accept that some (albeit it a huge minority) may feel it is a problem. Below I will make some points as to why I feel it is LESS of a problem than it is made to be on PvP-servers, and finally, a simple compromise that could be integrated with no large coding changes (I am assuming here, but once you see the solution I think you can agree its not a major change).<P>1. A typical Lvl 50 SK HT will do approximately 500 pts damage (rough estimation) in PvP. If they use it, are killed in that battle, they return to their bind-point and must wait 72 mins (I belive this is the refresh time... never actually had the patience to check it in-game) before it comes back. However, a Lvl 50 wizard, killed in PvP returns to his bind-point with no mana. How long does it take for that same wizard to meditate enough to be able to cast a 500 pt DD? 5-10 mins? And that is being generous I would assume.<P>2. Seeing as how SKs, being melees, cannot currently bind anywhere that does not have a "city" flag (i.e. Neriak, CoM, GF), while casters can bind almost anywhere, doesn't this make caster bind-rushing still more viable currently than SK bind-rushing? This leads to point 3...<P>3. When an SK uses his HT in PvP, and then dies during that encounter, he now must wait upwards of 72 mins before he is at full fighting capability. HT IS a very important part of an SKs arsenal in PvP. A caster on the other hand is at full strength againonce all their mana is back... say, approximately 15 mins. So, for over an hour after a PvP death in which the SK used his HT, he is penealized for that encounter. In all subsequent PvP encounters during this time he is far from able to function at full capability. No other class, not even paladins, have this restriction placed on them<P>4. Previously an SK could know that in any PvP battle he could use his HT (provided it was up), even if the encounter was in doubt, because on death it would refresh, and therefore in any other PvP encounter following this death he would not be at a severe disadvantage, even though he had died in the first battle. Now, the situation is essentially that you MUST be sure your HT will kill your opponent, or change the outcome of the battle. Why? To use it and still die means you have essentially wasted your HT, since it will not refresh for 72 mins, even after dying. Therefore, in all subsequent PvP encounters during the period the SK is at a severe disadvantage.<P>SOLUTION:<P>Upon death, if the SK has previously used his HT, and it has not yet refreshed, instead of having HT refresh immediately (as prior to the latest patch), have a 10 or 15 min timer start, at the end of which the HT will refresh.<P>This means that no SK can use his HT for bind-rushing, since those who killed him have at least a 10-15 min repreve. This seems consistent with the fact that a caster who returns to his bind-point with no mana after a PvP death need only med for 10-15 mins to be at full functionality, and cause considerably more damage than an SKs HT.<P>This solution also means that an SK may use his HT in PvP without being concerned that if he were to die in that encounter, he would be at a disdvantage for quite some time even following retrieving his corpse.<P>Its a good compromise. Ask any questions you may have about the reasoning Absor, I know I kind of began to ramble.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OK I think everyone is kind of confused.<BR> SK's and Paladins are supposed to be opposites of each other. In so Verant tries to keep them pretty much balanced so if one gets something the other usually gets it as well.<BR> But what they and all the rest of you are failing to realize is this.<P>They are opposites a pally is a goody goody and a SK is an evil SOB.<BR> Paladins help others , SK's kill others. <BR> Paladins have LoH which in return heals someone a SK has HT with in return hurts someone.<BR> Paladins get healing spells to help others. SK's get dots which hurt others. <BR> Paladins get buffs to help other people. SK's get debuffs to hurt other people.<BR> When you think of a paladin you think of someone who is noble and will strive to defend the innocent.<BR> When you think of a SK you think of some evil guy wrecking chaos on everything he touches.<P>Paladins are in respect a Defensive class where the SK is an Offensive class. Why is the SK haveing their Defense increased and not their Offense instead? in our spell listing how many of them is a defensive type of spell? maybe 2<P> I think that verant should increase our Offinsive to be on parr with a Warriors and increase a paladins to be on parr with a warriors.<P>some of you are thinking well that would overbalance the class's vs the warrior. I think you are very wrong.<BR>While a SK will have their skills increased to a warriors we will never in our wildest dreams with our epic weapons be able to deal out the same amount of damage as a warrior.<BR> And in the same respects a Paladin with their defensive skills increased on parr to a warrior not be able to tank a mob with in the best armor they can get vs a warrior with worse armor.<P>so this is what needs to happen<P>Paladins needs to have their Defensive skills includeing parry, dodge, and reposite increased to be equal to a warrior and a SK needs to have his offensive and weapon skills increased to be equal to a warrior <BR> If this happens then I think the class's will be more balanced</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This concerns on SK but it counts in some degree for the other hybrids too.<P>All spells with casting time over 2.0 (with or wothout patch) are getting nearly useless if the hybrid has to be the main tank in the group. The new patch benefits only the post 50 again.<P>A shadow knight is a very offensive class in the case of his spell. There are nearly no defensive spells and if there are any then they are expensive (because they need components). <P>What an SK needs is an AC self buff only line like the ones of a necro. (Shielding line)<P>An improvement of the Siphon Strength spell would be nice too. (Ex: Drain Srength draining 20 STR at lvl 30 and a Draw Strength at 49 or higher draining 40 STR).<P>The spell "Vampiric Embrace" procs too less and it is too weak. Please use the necro version and not that wimpy spell it is now for the SK.<P>The Life-Tap spell are too weak for the SK levels.<BR>Lvl 9 Tap should at least heal 8-10 damage, The lvl 15 Tap should heal 18-22 damage.<BR>lvl 30 Tap should heal 55-60 damage<BR>Add a lifetap spell at lvl 39 because the next lifetap spell after lvl 30 is lvl 50 (the requirement to do the Life Leech spell quest)<BR>And the next regulary Lifetap spell again is at lvl 51.<P>And one thing more: Hybrids needs at least one spell per circle that is not shared with the parent class. Else a hybrid can be rendered nearly useless. (This counts especially for the SK with his DoTs).<P>Elfenfeuer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>That last point is very important.  If you have a cleric and paladin in a group, do you have a problem?  No, a heal is a heal.  If the paladin heals you, then the cleric, his heal isn't overwritten.  If you have a druid and ranger doing DD, is there a problem?  No, there is some extra damage dealt by the ranger.  And with a necro and an SK?  Every dot we lay down can be overwritten by the necro, so we have just been rendered into a weak warrior.<P>So some unique SK only dots would be a good idea for us.  Or make our versions of dots stackable (not sure how to do this, maybe create a different spell with the same name so the game can handle it as if it were a different spell and stack it?).  Or finally, make most of the damage spells the sk has tap based instead of dot, in which case we are like a paladin/ranger in that we add a bit to damage, add a bit to (our own) healing.<P>One other point I was thinking about.  It has been mentioned before how SKs, and hybrids in general have always been double-triple-quadruple penalized for things.  We had the exp penalty, the mana penalty, the lesser spells, lesser skill caps, etc.  You can see how these multiple penalties add up over time to make us weaker than we should.<P>One example is spellcasting.  What if we had the same casting skill caps as necros, along with specialization.  Would we be as powerful as necros?  Of course not, our spells are still weak, our INT is still much lower because we need AC/STR more than INT.  Ok, what if our skills are lower, but you up the spells we get?  Same thing, we don't have the kind of mana a necro would have, so we would burn it up fast, and we also couldn't tank and cast these long casting spells.<P>It has also been pointed out in other posts that you could give an SK the same skill caps as a warrior and they would still be better offensively and defensively due to equipment, disciplines, more skills, more choice of weapons, and other inherent abilities.<P>I really don't see why everyone seems so timid about upping the hybrid skills given all of this.  I think we should have equivalent melee to warriors, after all, we are still going to be 1 hander and shield or 2 hander.  We don't have dual wield and triple attack.  And for casting, give us the full skills of a necro, the casting haste that has been added and the existing spell lineup (with a few additions/changes, but no major increase in spell power would be required, instead it would just be in the type of spell).  What would be the problem?  So at level 60 I can cast a level 30 spell as efficiently and even faster than a necro!  Oh no!  The necro most likely would not be caught dead casting that spell at level 60 anyway!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok we have a few improvements, hopefully this is a stepping stone to the total fix.  The new spells are "ok", i.e. anything that gives us an increased stat is good.  One problem with them though is that unless your soloing, they are too weak to give up a "buff slot" that could be better filled by the Shamen, Druid, Enchanter or Cleric.  Nothing youm gave us is unique and powerful enough, I sometimes can't even justify taking a slot for Vamperic Embrace because it does so little.<P>You want to ballance the "grouping" issues, well our new spells won't be used in groups they are too low level.  Soloing they have limited value, but not for a properly balanced group.<P>Melee, I was a killing Machine at level 15, still was at 30.  I hold my own at 42 but I see my damage going down in relation to Warriors.  This isn't excessive and I still play main tank most times in my groups, but I'm starting to see the difference.  Biggest issue is the misses.  I stood toe to toe with the Ry`Gorr chief last night when he was too low on life to move or fight, I missed 8 times in a row with my Dark Reaver.  The level 37 Rogue in our group finally got free from the other MoB we were fighting and killed him for me, 2 hits (no misses).  That was embarrassing.  Is that what we have to look forward too as we level without weapons and offensive skil increase?  I love this class, I'll keep playing it as long as I play EQ, but I may have to stop playing him as much if I get much worse.  (back to soloing low blues I guess)<P>I don't really care how hard I hit (although good damage would be nice), but if I don't hit they, I don't taunt, disrupt, proc or any other useful effect.  I don't care whay I can hit with, if you say we will only get a skill upgrade in 2hs, 1hs, 1hb whatever, I'll addapt and use that, I JUST WANT TO HIT MOBs CONSISTANTLY.<P>Please keep working on the ballance, don't forget about us.  We are trying to be rational with our requests (well most of us), give us some feedback on what is still in the works.<P>To those pushing for a skell illusion, it's not a ballance issue, put it off a little bit.<P>Duel Wield seems to finally have died out (hopefully), but I think the concensius is that we need a bash/shield upgrade.  If that goes through (please, please, please) then up our 1hs/1hb skills only and leave it at that.  That limits our damage output and gives us the defensive slant we are being pushed into.<P>Thanks for reading all this.<P>Neptunis Rex</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>To the necro player that just posted:<BR> <BR>You sir,are mistaken. Badly.<BR> <BR>When I cast,I am in melee combat,not sitting behind my pet. Most frequently,I am tanking. I need that speed just to get a spell off with any reliability.<BR> <BR>If you'd like to try casting while being whacked repeatedly all the time you can see what we mean. Many spells in the SK lists aren't used owing to the incapacity to cast them in our role-that of a front-line combatant.<BR> <BR>The same applies to Feign Death. We get the upgrade because we fight. <BR> <BR>We get the massively inferior version of Summon Corpse,at a far higher level than the necro does,and furthermore you get an improved version of it(using the stackable coffins). Paladins get the inferior rez spell. Why shouldn't I get the inferior Summon spell?<BR> <BR>Overall,our casting power is far lower than a necro of the same level-our spells are weaker,our mana supply lower(owing to the need to concentrate on melee protection over raw INT and mana),and our spells far more prone to combat interruption.<BR> <BR>So take your arguments and take them elsewhere.

I think that Verant doesn't know what to do with us and really doesn't care, don't forget, we are a minority and a minority has no right of speaking in the Vision(TM), if we were a larger group of people, they would have listend to us (just look at the other classes.....)<P>I am very sad about this, like most other SK's i think i will go and play an other character.<P>Gravel Blacksoul,<BR>A very tired SK of all this "Balancing" stuff  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The only thing that really bothers me right now is my hit and miss ratio. Make it so we hit a little more. If you cant do that because we are too defensive in your eyes then up all of the defensive skills, like dodge parry and the likes. Im tired of not being able to hit while getting pounded on left and right from low defensive skills.  None of this inbetween crap. Make us one or the other. One simple step up all defensive skills or up our atk skills a bit...not too hard to figure out.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000670-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000670.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000670-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000670-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000670-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000670-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000670&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000670&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
