</FONT><HR>There are already some people studying the new experience tables and it appears that Trolls and Iksar's who are not a Rogue or Warrior will be leveling 20% slower than normal.<P>For every 5 bubbles you make, my Troll Shaman will only make 4. Every 5 times you level, I'll only level 4 times. That seems a little harsh for regeneration and Slam (for the Trolls). Some people are forgetting the horrible faction penatly both races get and the added disadvantage of being big for Trolls.<P>I could easily understand if we had a penatly equal to the Ogres maybe, but we don't. We have a distinctly larger penatly then they do. I don't see how this is helping anyone, only hindering anyone who wants to play a Troll or Iksar.<P>LanceOmega</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Trolls and Iksar both have regen. Therefore they have considerable less downtime than other races. It only makes sense that they require more experience to level, since in a given period of playing they can get more experience.<BR>Basically, they won't be "left behind".

I really don't care to (and even more now that they've redone the experience tables).<P>I group a lot, it provides the most efficent and enjoyable way for me to level up. Regeneration doesn't help me much when the mob rarely takes any of my health. And, my downtime is everyone else's.

</FONT><HR>When is the last time your group decided not to heal the troll or iksar after a big fight?  Did you all say, well don't heal THAT warrior after the fight, we'll just sit and wait for him to regen.  I think not.  Regen doesn't come into play, because no group waits around for the warrior to regen his hitpoints.<P>If I still get that 20% exp penalty, then make regen better.  It should go up every few levels throughout the warriors life.  Otherwise, it isn't a bonus in later levels and the penalty is for nothing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Azith:<P>You're missing the point.<P>Before the patch, in a group, the troll SK was leveling just as fast as everyone else in the group.  Now he is leveling slower because of the troll penalty, which unlike the previous penalty, isn't being shared among the group.<P>IMO it's a valid complaint.  They should have removed ALL penalties, as WELL as all bonuses.  Yes, the halfling 5%, and the warrior/rogue 10% should have been removed as well.

</FONT><HR>Racial regeneration is usually downplayed on these boards, but it's an extremly useful ability.  Not so much on a per-fight basis, but on the fact that as a general course, you ARE going to have more health than the same class of a different race would.  If you're traveling and take some damage on the way, you might be at full health when you arrive instead of down a bubble or two.  You will, in general, be in a slightly better position than you would be otherwise.<P>It's not a night or day difference (though iksar necromancers are arguably heavily benefitted), but it's definitely nice to have.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Micker well let me give you a few reasons.  First off less iksar quests than any other race.  Secondly, more places for DE Necro to go to get spells.  Iksar have to travel a minimum of thirty mins to get to their only Necro guild in Cabilis.  Yes More AC but less hitpoints, check I will bet you will find that an equal lvl iksar necro has less hps than a DE Necro of the same lvl.  I agree that there should be some sort of penalty but not as much as there is.  As for swimming, sure that helps when swimming to the teleport room in Timirous to get back to our guild, but you cant outswim any MoBs even at 200 so whats the big deal about that.  Finally, necros cant solo forever and be practical so why have an exp penalty at high lvls.  If you really want to be fair, all exp penalty should be removed at least while grouped, and a smaller penalty should be implemented for trolls and iksar when they solo.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Cannibalizing off of regen amounts to a 3% increase in mana regen rate for Troll/Iksar Shaman, not 20%.<P>The disadvantages of Trolls and Ogres vs. Barbarians are insane.  If anything the fatees should get an xp bonus, not a penalty.<P>I'll repost some of the reasons I posted on the Shaman board:<P>The penalty for Ogres MAY have been justified early on in the game. Not being stunned can be a big issue. 15% still seems a bit much to me. <P>Since Kunark, Ogres and Trolls became very disadvantaged. A lot of things in Kunark are considered "giant" and therefore CAN stun Ogres even from in front. Everything in Chardok for example. Just doesn't happen often. Tons of Kunark loot is medium race only, including the Jarsath worn by most Barb and Iksar Shaman. Granite Spaulders from the hole have great resists and are 8AC higher than ANYTHING Ogres and Trolls can wear. Some claim they are rare, but I saw 8 of them drop my first 3 hours in the zone. Barbs have had Cultural armor added that adds WIS on every piece with some pieces adding other stats and resists. Ogres have had Cultural armor added that just adds STR, no other stats or resists. Like I need more STR. With no points added at creation, an Ogre Shaman has 248 STR naked self buffed at level 50. Hopefully things will start appearing out of Kael that even things up, but I'm not holding my breath. <P>Actually I don't believe there should have EVER been a penalty because the STR STA and unstunability is more than balance by the other downsides, but oh well. Went with Ogre mainly cause I like bein a big goofball sometimes. Ogres have the worst faction in the game except for Iksar, only Trolls are close. . The only stats Ogres have higher than Barbs is STR, STA, and 2 points of DEX. All other stats are lower except INT which is the same. 13 less AGI means a little less AC (negligible) and slower defense increases. The HUGE size is a much bigger issue than most think (see below). <P>Size causes problems in most zones including both Cazic and Guk and ALL cities other than Oggok, Grobb, and possibly Kael & the dragon city. This is why Upper Guk is always empty. Its a better designed dungeon than Crushbone in my opinion, but its in the fatty areas and they can't effectively hunt there without shrink. One thing you may not be aware of if you haven't played an Ogre is the game treats them as MUCH bigger than they look, both for collision detection and in determining eye level perspective. An Ogre sitting down has slightly higher eye level than a Barb does standing up. So ANYWHERE where a Barb has to duck, there is no way an Ogre can fit without Shrink. An Ogre with a plate graphic helm (totemic) is treated by the collision detection code as rougly the height that cyclopses in Rathe Mountains appear to be. Our eye level is maybe 6 inches below the cyclops eye. When in melee range of most creatures, you have to look down to see them. <P>The game apparently determines fall damage not only by how much you're carrying, but by how much your race is supposed to weigh. An Ogre will die from falling if they try to run through Oasis with Spirit of Cheetah. (I've taken over 600 points in a fall running through Oasis with just normal SoW, not encumbered). <P>If anything, Ogres should get an exp BONUS, at least the Shaman for who STR, STA, and Slam don't matter. <P>Same with Trolls. An extra 2HP every 6 seconds till 50 (7 extra at level 51+), is not a big deal for Shaman who have regen and healing spells. And Troll stats are terrible. And they get a resistance penalty, while Barbs get a resistance bonus. <P>The only race for which the xp penalties might be justified is Iksar, because of the AC bonus.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I posted this in another thread, but it applies here as well:<P>"Someone said: 'Every race has it's advatages and disadvantages. Just like with classes you give up somethings in order to get others.'<BR>What (other than being a large race) do trolls give up? <BR>They have night vision.<BR>They have great warrior stats.<BR>They have regen.<BR>They have slam.<P>Faction? Troll faction isn't great, but with a little work they can buy and sell in a decent range of places. This is an evil race penalty more than a troll penalty.<P>Skills? Trolls can't hide. Trolls can't forage. Trolls can't sneak. I cannot remember the full range of racial skills, but I do believe that trolls get slam and regen, which happen to be the 2 best warrior racial abilities.<P>Basically, as far as the warrior and SK classes go, trolls deserve their exp penalty. Not because I don't like them (in fact I love my troll SK), but because they have less downtime than other warriors (due to regen, slam, nightvision, and better stats). They do not require as much healing (regardless of whether they are grouped or soloing). They can be more effective fighters with slam. They need less stat equipment (ie. they have much better warrior stats while wearing the same equipment as a smaller race), so troll warriors can shift their equipment over to almost pure AC while still having high strength and stamina. I think this is a great advantage. Even if stats don't decide the game, they are still important. They do have a size penalty on equipment with regards to barbarians, but being locked into one size of armor is the norm. Barbarians (and elves..) have the bonus of choosing from 2 size categories.<P>A case might be made that trolls are not the best shaman. While that is true, I think that as a whole, the troll race has advantages that would allow players to level significantly faster than other races without an offsetting penalty."<P><BR>In response to some other comments:<BR>"It makes no difference if they have a regen ability if the rest of the group dose not. You still have to wait till eveyone else heals up to attack the Mobs. Trolls only have one class that can solo and that is SKs. And even that is suspect. "<P>If the troll is regenerating the whole fight, then they have more hitpoints left at the end. Therefore they need less healing, resulting in the healers using less mana and the group spending less time waiting on the cleric/healer.<P>Also, I have seen only one warrior character soloing. A troll warrior, who was soloing in his mid 30's. I'm sure he used lots of bandages, and had sow potions and what not, but he was soloing for a solid week. <P>"Very valid point, regeneration does not make leveling faster. I would like to see this addresses."<P>Recovering hitpoints faster and being able to bash mobs without a shield (thereby letting you use better weapons) are abilities that will drop mobs faster with less life lost. Isn't that the definition of "leveling faster"?<P>"Size causes problems in most zones including both Cazic and Guk and ALL cities other than Oggok, Grobb, and possibly Kael & the dragon city. This is why Upper Guk is always empty. Its a better designed dungeon than Crushbone in my opinion, but its in the fatty areas and they can't effectively hunt there without shrink.

Our eye level is maybe 6 inches below the cyclops eye. When in melee range of most creatures, you have to look down to see them. "<P>I can understand how this is a drawback, but from the perspective of a warrior or shadowknight, this isn't really a balancing penalty for all the bonuses that the troll and ogre races offer. Yes, size is a problem, and sometimes you can get stuck and it can cost you a death, but it just doesn't happen often enough to totally balance out all the bonuses that trolls offer. <P>Trolls are incredibly powerful warriors and shadowknights. They also make great shamans.

</FONT><HR>I didn't plow through all the responses but my response to the original post is don't worry so much.<P>I have an Iksar and already figured it out just from the producer's letter.<P>If an Iksar and a human of the same level group then yes, the Iksar will fall behind.  Now, then human will level and the Iksar will be one level lower.<P>Now, an Iksar groups with a human one level higher.  The Iksar MAY loose ground but if he does it'll be at a slower rate.  Once the Iksar falls behind some number of levels the Iksar will stop falling behind.  I can't tell how many levels lower the Iksar would have to be without seeing the experience tables (which you can't see without hacking EQ).  <P>What you forget is that like all other RPGs, the experience required to gain a level is exponential.  It takes FAR more experience to go from level 20 to 21 then it does to go from level 10 to 11.  It takes more experience to go from 21 to 22 then it does to go from 20 to 21.  If a level 20 and a level 21 are grouping under the new rules the experience is divided almost evenly but the level 20 needs less experience to level then the level 21.  Eventually the Iksar will fall behind enough so that his share of experience moves him as close to his next level as the human's share of experience moves him to his next level.<P>So in the end, an Iksar or a Troll get some nice racial abilities and pay for them by being a few levels lower then other people they group with all the time.<P>If you didn't understand what I just said, don't worry about it.  You won't be falling behind forever.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One thing to point out is that for 3 of the 4 penalty races, Shaman is one of the ONLY 3 classes that those races can be, accounting for at least half of all Ogres and Trolls (SKs are not popular), and at least 90% of all Barbs.<P>Also as far as stats go, Trolls have 30 something higher STR and STAM than a Halfling.<P>STR has been shown time and time again to make very little difference.  66 STR from a Shaman buf makes about a 2% difference in damage output.(Verant has verified that the reason shaman stat bufs do so little is to keep any one race from being too powerful).<P>Trolls and Ogres both also have 25 lower AGI and DEX than a Halfling.  Not saying AGI and DEX are all that important, just pointing out there are downsides balancing the STR and STAM.<P>And Trolls have 20 lower fire resistance and I think lower magic resistance as well.  The extra damage taken due to poor resists will more than counteract the extra regen against any casters.<P>The only REAL advantage of the large races is Slam.  And that is only important for Warriors and SKs (since it maps to bash skill).  For Shaman and Rogues the skill never improves above 0, and therefore rarely hits anything.  Rogues especially never use it because it disables backstab.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&lt;--<BR>What (other than being a large race) do trolls give up? <BR>They have night vision.<BR>They have great warrior stats.<BR>They have regen.<BR>They have slam.<BR>--&gt;<BR>What we give up.  Here we go.<BR>1. We give up plat to begin with.  We sell for less and buy for more.<BR>2. Being a "large" race is a HUGE draw back.  Play one in SolB and then talk to me.<BR>3. Barb's also have slam and good warrior stats<BR>4. We give up convenience.  This means play time.  Which is sure a lot more than our extra 3HP or regen mean while doing any fighting.<BR>5. We give up the ability to have racial armor.<BR>6. We give up the ability to wear certain armor(can you say Hero bracer).<BR>7. We give up the ability to hunt in KC if we want to buy or sell in Kunark at all.<P>Let's break you list down blad.<BR>Night vison - Wood Elfs, Half Elves, Trolls, DE, Iksar all have it.  If you don't, buy a light source.<P>Great Warrior stats - Maybe to start with.  Everything is fixable with gear and buffs.<P>Regen - A joke for a warrior once you begin grouping.  My 54 Druid goes from OOM to FM faster than my 51 Warrior goes from half health to full health.<P>Slam - Barbs, Trolls, and Ogre.  Nice attack.  To bad we don't stun very often and kick does more damage.<P><BR>Somehow you dismiss faction with a wave of your hand.  I can't tell you how many RL days I have done nothing but try to fix faction.  <P>How does nightvison and slam effect downtime?  Buy a greater lightstone if you have no night vison.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;Therefore they have considerable less downtime than other races. &lt;&lt;<P>Troll Regen does nothing to help a Shaman get their mana back.

</FONT><HR>I am not going to address if the racial penalty is a good idea or not (I think it is but that is beside the point)<P>The real point that I am going to address is that the racial penalities are EXACTLY as they were before the patch.  Iksars and Trolls are not leveling any slower than they were before.  There is not modifier against experience EARNED that is racial, it is simply more exp NEEDED.
