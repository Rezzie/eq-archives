</FONT><HR>Brief statement of some concerns about the wizard class.<BR>The biggest negative concerns about the wizard class.<P>1) Many wizards do not feel that they are adding much if any value to their groups.<BR>2) Wizards are not ‘pulling there load’ vs. velious uber mobs, 100k+ hit point mobs make the damage a wizard can deal, very mute.<BR>3) A wizard has a very hard time staying in a battle due to very long med times.<BR>4) Due to many of the enhancement in the various melee classes, wizards can no longer keep up with the damage being dealt by some of the melee classes, both in speed and damage.<BR>5) Wizards lose a lot of power due to not having a pet, though giving us one is not a solution many wizards want, or what I am going to ask for. Pet classes at least can offer their pet as a source of value to a group even when they are oom.<BR>6) Downtime due to medding is the single biggest drawback, and a down fall to this class. I can agree to some of this to some degree.<P>I would like to point out some of the positive points of the class. Which I don’t feel any more change is necessary in to obtain or maintain balance. A change in any of these areas I feel would create over powering in one area or another.<P>1) Equally fast Evocation spells to other classes, the 3 second cast of DD spells, and 2 second cast of PB AE spells, is enough to fill the wizards role as masters of quick damage, in any group AE or single pull situations.<BR>2) Spell Damage compared to other classes is slightly higher then most other classes spells or has a lower cast time and mana usage factor, therefore this maintains are title of masters of evocation.<BR>3) AE spell Damage or delay is exceptional nice, so for the extremely rare groups where these spell work we fit nicely.<BR>4) Overall efficiency of the class is good, compared to battles against single mobs with DD spells or multiple mobs with AE spells.<P>What can be done to the wizard class?<P>Make a change to the way Harvest works. Bare with me please this is slightly different then most ideas you have previously read.<P>Cut the mana regained from Harvest in half to 150 maximum, but then also cut the recast time on the spell to 4 ½ minutes. This is not really any different then the spell currently works, however the real change needed is below.<P>Have Harvest take the number of members in the group and multiply it times the amount of mana normally gained if not grouped. So for example, if I normally gain 150 points of mana from Harvest (solo), if I am grouped with 6 other people I would Harvest 900 points of mana.<P>This is 4 nukes, or 2,652 extra points of Damage every 4 ½ minutes at level 55, which is about the same amount of damage a mage or necro with there pet is going to out damage me by in this time frame. <P>Before I go any farther someone other then me came up with this idea and the good reasons why, but I liked it so much I decided to make sure someone reads this. I edited the whole thing but only slightly, so this may or may not reflect the orginial authors ideas.<P>1) This will help us to keep up with the tanks and pets in damage output.<BR>2) From a role-play sense, we gather mana from are surrounding. So this should be the people and the magical items around us, the best and easiest measurement would be how many people are in are group.<BR>3) Doing so would not allow us to solo something we couldn’t before.<BR>4) Encourage us to find a group.<BR>5) It doesn’t become a PvP issue.<BR>6) Its more fun casting nukes then sitting on are butts doing nothing, holding just enough back for evacs.<BR>7) Would help us stay in the long battles with Velious Uber Mobs, battles lasting up to a hour.<BR>8) Would not be over powering on previous mobs, as I feel a gap is becoming larger, between melee efficency and caster.<P>55 Wizard of the Nameless<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>    I agree that wizards need something other than pets or more powerfull nuks so they will be more valuable to groups. I see more and more posts regarding this issue and as a wiz I fully agree with it ( but I have noticed that sugestions of this type keep getting slamed after the posts; my guess is that the slams are from no wiz classes ). However this change to harvest would be too powerfull and I realy doubt that EQ would empliment it ( what is to stop a wiz from grouping with 6 ppl for 1min just so they can cast harvest and get the mana bonus). I think a change like this would more likely be used for soloing than to help wizards with grouping.<P>    That is my 2cp. I am glad to see that other  ppl are at least trying to think something to help the wiz class with grouping issues. If you want to see some ideas I had check out my post titled ( no one wants to group with wizards they are the lepors of EQ )</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Those are the fustrations Ive had in the past at lower levels but it goes once you realize what a wizard is there for....<P>1. A wizard is not there to put the most damage in on a mob on regular camps.  That line of thinking gets you killed or aggrod most of the time.  A wizard helps fights go faster.  Fighting and gaining experience is usually a group thing and everyone is there for a purpose - recognize your groupmates strengths and modify your playing to fit that.  Those little 20-220 points a melee is doing adds up a lot -- but you put your 2 cents in also with 1120 damage in just 6 seconds.<P>2. Mana - Once you get to 200int you can get a lot of Mana objects to increase your mana anywhere from 200-500+ extra mana easily (even if you mistwinked your int in the beginning).  Also, you get manaskin in 50's, it stacks with c2, and bard songs -- ive actually found myself medding a whole lot less with manaskin + any one of the follow above.  The thing to remember is you dont have to DUMP your mana totally on one blue mob on a experience camp then med for 10 mins.  You dump 2k - 4k into one mob on an experience camp and youve barely used a bub of magic (at 50+)<P>I consider my character extremely valuable to a group -- fights last a lot shorter with me around, i know how to conserve mana for the Sh** Happens scenario (and it does happen)...that is a wizards true time to shine and the 'make fights go faster' really helps when tanks stamina starts to drain.  Im there to evac my group if we cant overcome the s-happens scenario.  Also stun lines help clerics get that long cast time in with much sucess when they need to complete heal a near dead melee.  Without stun - many melee would die or the healer of the group would be oom all the time.<P>The issue is not mana or mana-regen -- its knowing your class and knowing how to play the hand that was delt to you.  Every class could use some modifications im sure -- but we are not lepers of eq and are needed.  If you dont recognize that you should probably explore another class - they all have their advantages and disadvantages.<P>"Come to my DOJO - i will teach you Daniel-San.  First you must wash all of these cars.

</FONT><HR>Oceanbreeze, i have to disagree with almost all of your negative concerns.<P>1) "Many wizards do not feel that they are adding much if any value to their groups."  I have seen this drivel on many boards, but have never met a wizard that has said this.  I can only believe that the folks that spout this are either not really inclined to play a wizard, or self-deluding themselves into believing they are the center of the universe.  Wizards play a support role in any group... we will never be the center of attention, but we are always valuable.  <P>2) "Wizards are not ‘pulling there load’ vs. velious uber mobs, 100k+ hit point mobs make the damage a wizard can deal, very mute."  You bring up an interesting point here.  The uber mobs in Velious are far outside the scope of anything we have had to fight before, and therefore require new tactics.  The 9-10k damage that an individual wizard can dish out against the ubermobs may not seem like much in the fight, but what about all the fights getting up to that mobs?  What about the ability to translocate folks home when they have to leave before the raid is over?  The list goes on.  'Pulling your load' doenst have to mean DD only, otherwise druids would be even less welcome on these uber raids than you must perceive wizards are (that is sarcasm, for all the druids out there).<P>3) "A wizard has a very hard time staying in a battle due to very long med times."  If you are always OOM, then I say you aren't rationing your mana properly.  Wizard's are all about the judicious use of force.  Pace yourself... let the warriors do most of the work, and be ready to save the enchanters butt when there is an overpull, and one or two mobs need to get burned down fast so he can sustain that wonderful mez on the rest indefinitely.  :-)<P>4) "Due to many of the enhancement in the various melee classes, wizards can no longer keep up with the damage being dealt by some of the melee classes, both in speed and damage."  I have now idea where you came up with this... I challenge you to find a single melee class that can dish out damage faster than a wizard can, at comperable levels and equipment.  (btw, you refuted this point in your first note under positive things about the class)<P>5) "Wizards lose a lot of power due to not having a pet, though giving us one is not a solution many wizards want, or what I am going to ask for. Pet classes at least can offer their pet as a source of value to a group even when they are oom."  How do wizards "lose" anything by not having a pet?  It is not like they were taken away from us.  Pets are one of the balances the other casters get for having to run everywhere.  There is alot more to this game than just doing damage in a fight.<P>6) "Downtime due to medding is the single biggest drawback, and a down fall to this class."  You are absolutely correct here, in part.  As wizards, we live and die by our mana... it is our life blood, even more important than HP.  Which is why we need to be careful where and wehen we use it.  We already have a huge advantage over other classes.  Not only are our DD the most mana efficient, but they are all evocation spells... this means that our specialization applies to all of them, making them even more efficient.  This is a point i see getting overlooked alot.  Downtime is boring... but if you are in a halfway decent group, then you have clarity2, or at least clarity.<P>I have already posted alot here, so I will stop here.  They me conclude by saying that the Wizard class is not for everyone.  If you are upset with it, by all means move on to something else.  Not everyone is suited to play every class, you couldn't pay me to be a cleric... talk about being bored all teh time :-).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=004817&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=004817&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
