</FONT><HR>Multiquesting used to be a bug, at retail.  Most quests implemented after this were designed with it in mind ; thus, it's no longer a bug but one of the game's feature.  If you do away with multiquesting, you will need to remove No Drop from most of the quest items in the game.<P>Maybe it could have been considered a bug at retail, no longer.  It IS a part of the game, because the game has been designed around it for 2 years.<P>But this will be implemented, because most of the lower (50-) level player have no idea, are totally clueless to the fact that, this is a nerf directed at them, not at the 51+ who have already completed their epics.  Just like the Hate agro changes were a nerf directed towards the up and coming players, who are'nt as versed in how agro works and don't have as much time as the Ubers to develop strategies around it.<P>And none of the quest items will be changed, just like when the Breastplates were nerfed none of the Monsters that were designed around those items were modified.<P>Same old, same old.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Um, ok, apparently everyone but me knows this, but what is "multi-questing"?  Is that where multiple people combine their loot to complete a quest?  <P>For example, Quest X needs components A, B, C and D.  A and B are Lore No drop.  Character Y has managed to get items B, C and D, but A is unavailable to him for some reason...like campers.  Someone, let's say Character Z, hears Y lfg so he can get this final item for his quest and she has said item and doesn't want/need it.  <P>Currently, if Characters Y and Z were to go to QuestCentral (where ever quest is), Z could turn in item A, then Y could turn in BCD and the quest would be completed, no?<P>This is what you would like to stop, yes? Is this to stop farming? Or is it an inherent change in how the NPC's are coded?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor I think this is a better solution.<P>If you give the NPC one of several right items the NPC should say yes I was looking for this do you have the rest? At which time the Multi-quester would give the rest of the items.<P>If the player does not have the rest of the items he simply says to the NPC no and the NPC will return the item.<P>Multi-questing is really a great way for players to interact and help each other out. I for one loved helping another Ranger in another guild get his Epic. It made a new friend that I otherwise probably would not have met.<P>Another problem comes to mind. Right now for Rangers and Druids they both need stones from Venril Sathir. Well on our server and most servers only one or maybe 2 guilds every kill Venril because of time zones and the ability to have the right people on every 7 days at spawn time. This would mean that while these one or 2 guild monopolize this spawn then no other guild would have a chance and aquiring a Venril Sathir stone for there epic. <P>Venril Sathir is really to long of a spawn (7 days) to be fun for most players but that is another issue intirely.<P>This above example is one of many reasons mulit-questing is a good thing for EQ players.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

However...<P>It just seems like a mask to hide the goal of nerfing multi-questing.  Make it policy to reimburse items that were turned in incorrectly first, THEN worry about putting in a system to prevent that IF that is your goal.

</FONT><HR>Do not make this change.  So a couple of gimps get Jboots (no doubt what this is about).  Everyone working in POS, VP keys, etc. now get totally hosed.  Half our guild wouldn't be able to go to VP if it wasn't for the ability for other members to help out getting the keys of the very rare spawns (blood gill and ancient jarsith come to mind).  Not to mention all of us holding rare sky items in the hope of one day helping a friend out with them.<P>In answer to the question what if we make these items tradeable.  Yeah just like you were going to adjust mobs designed specifically for donnal bps when you nerfed them.<P>Quit messing with the game, you guys have done enough damage in the past two weeks already.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>the correct solution for you would be 2 fold.<P>1) give a time limit in which items need to be handed to an npc for multiquesting. That way multiquesting works, but you could always just wait a few minutes before turning stuff in to make sure his inventory is "clear"<P>2) items you dont want multiquested (read jboots!!) change the quest to need a combine box.<P>pretty simple really, you solve both issues, while still allowing multiquesting</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Multi-questing goes against the spirit of several of the quests, most specifically J-boots.  Eliminating it is not a nerf because the fix puts the implementation back in line with the INTENTION of the designers.<P>Fixing questing so it isn't so stinking annoying rocks no matter how you measure it.<P>BUT the KEY argument for fixing it?  It makes the game more accessible to the mainstream player.  The mainstream players are here on the fringes, but there is enough stupid junk that is wrong that must be fixed to open up the game to the masses.  Questing being part of the name of the game means that questing (and trade items) should ALL be useful and should ALWAYS work.  The more 'fool'proof the game is, the more the mainstream player can immerse and play.<P>My wife is a 'mainstream player'.  She has watched her geeky friends and husband play the game and grown interested over time.  She now plays with us but she gets pretty frustrated.<P>What frustrates her?<P>1.  It is nearly impossible to tell which way you are going in some zones.  /Loc is too hard to use and if you're immersed in warslik's woods, you have NO CLUE where you are.<P>2.  She can't tell what spell she is throwing because of the silly icons.<P>3.  She can't untarget and re-target easily when trying to heal.<P>4.  She doesn't get things like follow for free (why don't you have a stock set up for each class???)<P>5.  The keys don't automatically float between computers or chars, so she has to re-set them up every time.<P>I know the purpose of this thread is to discuss whether to put in a quest fix, but i just thought Verant should think about the possibilities of making EQ actually ACCESSIBLE to the average, non-hardcore (defined by your marketing department as buying LESS than 2 games or more per month or LESS than 10 or more per year) gamer.<P>Think about it!!  By the way...the non-hardcore gamer would never even THINK of trying to multi-quest...it just doesn't make sense to them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>With the difficulty of some of the harder (high level end game) quests the ammount of time and people required to get the items needed for them often leaves out the oppertunity for the person the group of people is working to complete the quest for to loot.  This means all the work guilds do could often go to waste if multiquesting was nerfed.<P>Examples are armour drops in ToV, some armour peices are so rare (ie plate chest peice) you want to save it for a certine member that has done alot for the guild.  Currently anyone could loot it and save it for that certine member to multiquest with the gems.  If this was taken away rewarding people for their effort would be much more difficult.<P>Please don't take this away, you've destroyed the game enough in the last few weeks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Please do NOT nerf multiquesting.<P><BR>For many people, multiquesting is the only way that a quest can be finished. Many mobs in the game die when people are at work or at school - multiquesting allows those people to have an opportunity to complete a quest that they would not otherwise be able to complete. Not everyone can live in EverQuest 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. These same people who cannot be there to get their quest drops are able to get them indirectly by playing EQ the way it was meant to be played - by interacting with other players.<P><BR>I myself had a few brain nerfs that caused me to mess up a quest turn in. I sucked it up and redid what I had to do, and spent 20+ hours requesting. Guess what?

However, if people are willing to run the risk of multiquesting and loosing items due people before them messing up their turn ins - they should be allowed to take that risk.<P><BR>Additionally, if you turn in ALL the items needed to complete a quest or a quest segment yourself - you still get the reward no matter what. People who can correctly turn in all quest items themselves are not hurt by people before them that mess up their turn ins and are in no way at any risk.<P><BR>It isn't broken - please don't "fix" it.<P><BR>Crydee Ossiriand<BR>L53 Ranger, Ayonae Ro<BR>Writer of the Ranger Epic Quest FAQ<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>If the mob keeps the items when given them (ie. doesn't hand them back) then when the mob is killed it should have the said items, which leads into the next point.<P>If the item is no drop then it should NOT be possible to give it to an npc, NO DROP means it can't be traded sold or looted then why the hell can I give it to NPCs! Upon presenting to the correct quest NPC the item will be converted destoyed whatever consumed in the quest. (ie. /ooc if you give a no drop item to the wrong npc it should ALWAYS be returned).<P>Since a quest npc will never ask for a bag with items in it, any containers with items in it should be handed back to the person giving it to them. At the very least see the first paragraph.<P>No quest giver that you are meant to hand bits into should keep moving after being hailed. Even if they stop moving for 5seconds and emote "a_quest_npc stops and raises an eyebrow."<P>Multi questing should be left in, that way people on a raid can work together, a Wierd_no_drop_item drops, some one loots it, later you find out that a_stinking_quest_giver01 wants the item for some uber sword, but the cleric looted it. If you remove multiquesting then the cleric can get uber sword which no doubt is No Drop. Is EQ about working together and player based economies ? or about ebayed accounts and greed ? ATM with all the no drop stuff, you really need to have hailed every NPC in the game, or have to be using one of the various spoiler sites out there (thats hardly the vision I would imagine). Or perhaps there should be a way to make any/some quested No Drop items traddable (make it expensive to do tho).<P>If you want to stop Particular quests from being multiquested, make the player put the items in a combinable bag that produces a single no drop thing to give to the npc. And to get around the pp of some quests (eg. j boots) make them put in an appropriate number of gems or an expensive store bought thing (giving faction and charisma more of a role in the game). Also the quest bag when you hit combine should only compine/destroy the right recipe anythign else and it should say sorry can't do that.<P>I assume this is in response to people getting peeved with continually broken quests, bugged npcs, not to mention people scamming (ie. selling ring of ancient for real $$$ or huge pp and then "giving" the ring when in fact they are giving say giving a shadowed raiper). <P>To that end when you give an npc an item that he wants instead of saying what he says he needs, he should say something like "Yes I needed that an_item_for_quest, do forget the rest".<P>These are ideas I have after losing Alot of very valuable gear (a piece of dragon loot and better, 11 items in all, including one item I spent hundreds and hundreds of hours getting) to the transparent inventory and a quest mob that wouldn't stop when hailed. And of course your oh so helpful GMs stuffed me around for 6 hours until 4am local time only to tell me yes they can confirm what happened but that they can't help me.<P>Another time losing a bit that took 36 hours straight to get but lost it because 2 npcs where standing close together (thanks awesome pathing bugs) so I hailed the right one but gave it to the wrong one.<P>The quest interface and how mobs handle items being given to them needs to be improved, here's hoping you do it, however removing multiquesting is not the answer.<P>Annoying people with a bug ridden quest system that is more about stopping the minority of the scammers/cheats etc is silly. Quests should be user friendly non frustrating at the handing in level. Nothing worse then seeing several hundred or even thousands of hours of work go up in smoke, because you got a little excited or the npc was bugged or whatever. <P>Remember its a game verant, we the customers want to have fun, help us to have that fun.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Thanks for soliciting our input for doing this!  I like that a lot.  Would like to see it happen more often.<P>There are some nice advantages to having the NPC give you stuff back if it is wrong.  Yes, multiquesting would end and that would be sad.  <P>But there are some advantages to multiquesting ending too, it would prevent people from farming the ancient cyclops and doing some of the other quests over and over again to get a single no drop piece.<P>I'm divided over it.  <P>There's other ways to solve it though.  If you hand in the wrong stuff could you have a confirmation box that said, "you have handed in the wrong stuff, if you want your items back press "return my item", otherwise press "keep it and wait for more".  If you wait for more, it is possible that someone else might complete the quest before you do."<P>Hmmmm... if given the choice though I guess I would want the NPC to give back.  Maybe if that were to happen you should review the no drop status on quest pieces and change them where it seems reasonable.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

That way you dont acumulate a big DB store forever.<BR>Then I say, "Give me back my components"  and either a picklist comes up with the items that this player has handed to this NPC or you just put them in the players inventory.<P>There are a multitude of ways of doing this but this is a very feasable way to do it AND does everything you want.<P>Thank you for reading.

I ended up losing ALL the gems and the GM's said they couldnt help me (basically because they never can take a player's word for it).

</FONT><HR>One person here does NOT want multi-questing nerfed and is placing a very vocal vote in that direction.  If you want to fix NPCs, do it another way; there is always more than one solution to a problem.<P>Ok, you've always said, "Tell us how to do it!"  Here it is:  Don't do it.  By changing this issue, you continue your pattern of marketing your product to the lowest common denominator of the human food-chain in order to increase your sales.  Who cares about them?  They're a bunch of ignorant freaks anyway!<P>For those of us with half a clue, we realize that if this change happens, you will NOT evaluate the NO DROP tags on many high-level quests.  That basically breaks multi-questing and isn't acceptable after you've gone to all the trouble to develop quests with multi-questing in mind.<P>If you want to solve the AC/JBoot issue, make them insert the Ring into a box that Hasten will give you if you just ask for it, then make them COMBINE it with the other components.  There, now you can't multi-quest JBoots anymore.  You're a hero.  Let the whiners scream away about not being able to multi the JBoots quest, you saved multi-questing for EVERY OTHER QUEST IN THE GAME!!!<P>Also, you can't fix the "eating components" problem without hurting multi-questing unless you implement a pop-up confirmation check system for every quest in the game.  This would work as follows:<P>NPC requests item1, item2, item3, item4.<BR>PC hands in item1, itemb, item3, item4.<P>Confirmation window pops up showing the item's ID number text output for correct items in green and shows the item's ID number text output for incorrect items in red.<P>You hand NPC (green)item1, (red)itemb, (green)item3, (green)item4.<P>Now, even a complete moron can figure out that if they hit "Accept" and all the items aren't green, they eat all the items.  If one item is output in RED, then they STOP and hit "Cancel"(wow, I need to go patent that idea, red should always equal stop from now on.  Oops, it already does).<P>The information for this change is already there, all you have to do is show it to the user.<P>Meo</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I seriously can't believe you are even proposing this change after so long.  Your example is rather thinly veiled as someone else pointed out.  If this NPC is looking for the items, he's not going to care if 1 person brings them to him or 2 people who are together bring them.  It's even reasonable to think he would ask the 2 people who helped him with his task which one of them wanted the reward.  Furthermore, if you are going to attribute reasoning to NPC requests let's look at other things that are or are not realistic.  Why are things "no drop"?  Some sort of magical enchantment? Sure.  <P>If you're going to make any changes then make it so you don't lose all the items for turning in one wrong item.  Make the NPC give back all the items if there is a wrong one.  If all the items handed in are correct, leave it as is and allow either the same person or someone else to finish the quest.<P>Anyway, I cannot see any positive gain from this change.  Everyone is arguing that people should be there to do the whole quest.  Do you people not think that *most* quests, I would even say on the order of 80%+, are finished by one person?  Multi-questing gives the chance for the person to miss a certain fight every once in a while.  What is wrong with that?  And do you really think it is bad that people help others complete quests?<P>The biggest example I have seen so far is the Ancient Cyclops in South Ro.  I challenge anyone in here to say that there will be less instances of KSing if there is no more multiquesting.  Instead, it will just be different people each time but the incidents will be the same.  And if you're doing it for a twink, it would be reasonable to assume that if you're there in the first place you would take the time to bring the twink and maybe a friend to hold the corpse while you log off of your higher level character.  Guess what, nothing's changed.<P>In the past, there would always be some outcry that people will quit if such-and-such change goes through.  While I never gave them much credence because of the immersiveness of this game I think we're building up to a point where this may come true.  The heal aggro alone didn't do it.  This alone wouldn't do it.  Something else down the line won't do it alone.  But mix all those things in with the fact that this game is 2 years old, and other MMO games will be coming out soon and you have the recipe for a noticable decline in server population.  The more broad, unpopular changes you make in the name of the "integrity" of the game, the quicker this will happen.  There has to be a point where you leave well enough alone.  You're at that point, now you just need to realize it.  Seriously, when you guys actually play the game do you think it's too easy?  I don't, I just think it's fun.  Isn't that supposed to be the point?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"Would eliminating the problems with losing quest<BR>items to NPCs be worth the loss of the ability to multi-quest?"<P>No!  Absolutely not!  Multi-questing has been in game for over two years now!  You cannot honestly think the majority of players WANT multi-questing removed!<P>If you do this, it will be the single largest nerf to date and would affect 99% of the playerbase in a NEGATIVE way.  You will lose more customers over this change if you actually go through with it.<P>Multi-questing, as far as I know, was designed into the game.  Quests have been designed around the whole principle.  Why else would classes require no-drop components that are nice items for other classes?  (ie bards need a warrior weapon from Fear for their epic, necros need a nice wizard item from Hate for their epic, etc).  You would have to re-do all epic quests since they were designed (as far as I can tell) with the intent of the classes working together to multi-quest the various pieces.<P>PLEASE do NOT change questing works in EverQUEST.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
