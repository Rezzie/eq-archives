</FONT><HR>How about this guys and gals.<P>Level 20 spell (since that levels spells suck) <BR>Orb of Storing- conjuration skill.<BR>This spell would summon an orb (graphic of a lightstone) that is Lore/no drop so that you could only have one at a time. The orb once summoned would be useless until you picked it up and with it on your cursor cast a spell you want to store in the orb for future use. The orb could light up to let you know it has been charged. You can store any spell into the orb that you can cast normally.(even the summon orb spell, since the orb disappears when used, although that would be pointless) Then, when you needed to use that spell, like when OOM, you could simply right click the orb with the proper targeting and viola... one last blast when it counts.<BR>Of course the spell would have a casting time and be interruptable as usual. The orb would simply be a mana storage unit so to speak.<P>Personally I think I would use mine for an evac, since I tend to overburn a bit in tense situations and not have that last bit of mana needed for an evac. But you could store any spell you wanted in it, even Ice comet  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>Then you could med up to full!!!<P>At higher levels, say 29, 39, 49, the upgrades could hold several charges of the spell at a time. The orb would still be lore/no drop to prevent exploiting, and the spell stored would have to be the same exact same spell for each charge.<BR>So at level 29 you could store 2 charges of Inferno shock if you wanted. <P>Here's the kicker though. The summoning of the orb would be VERY mana costly, since conjuration isn't the wizards specialty. Say around 150-200 mana at level 20 and then up from there for the upgrades. That is JUST for summoning the orb, the charges are on top of that. So what this in effect does is make you med the mana back in a fair amount of time for the large benefit this gives, therefore balancing its power with downtime.<P>This would give the wizard a MUCH needed way of increasing his/her conjuration abilities well into the upper levels. As well as giving the wizard a balanced way to be useful to a group when OOM. As well as just being really COOL!!!!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  As seekers of knowledge shouldn't we have a way to STORE that knowledge for later access?!<P>Anyway, I think this would solve a LOT of the wizards main problems. Namely being totally useless when OOM and not being very group friendly. It would solve the first problem totally, and help somewhat with the second.<P>What are your thoughts????<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>OH yeah, forgot to mention that they should POOF when you zone or log out also.<BR>Sorry, but this IS a very powerful ability and would need to be balanced accordingly. Besides, they are summoned right ?<BR>Bye bye mana if you have to run for zone.<P>By doing this it would mean that you would have to summon the orb once you were already inside of the zone you would use it in. And then you would have to charge it and med to full. All in all, several hundred mana points and about 5-10 minutes of downtime, longer at higher levels with no clarity. Imagine the downtime on a level 49 orb that you charged with 4 Ice Comets!!! Lets see, 400 mana x 4 + around say 400 for summoning the orb itself = 2000 mana points! YEOUCH!!! hee heee, but WELL worth it if you are desperate enough to be chain casting 4 manaless Ice Comets.<P>Oh yeah, you could also replace charges if you have an orb that holds more than one and you used one of them. So an orb with 2 charges that you used once could be charged back up to 2 for only the cost of the spell.<P>Wow, i'm drooling and I know this will never make it live. But its still a nice dream, SIGH.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>P.P.S.<P>hee hee, last one for a while promise.<P>I'm a wizard over level 30 and my conjuration skill is 16, and my specialize conjuration skill is 23. GO FIGURE!!! hee hee, trained specialize at level 23 and never cast either of the two useless spells we get that use it.<BR>Wizards REALLY need something at higher levels for this spell skill, makes me look like a newbie when I try to cast eye of zomm  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><BR>even if it isn't my idea, PLZ implement something to boost this skill....<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Me again :P<P>Verant could do any number of variations to this idea to balance it. Instead of giving additional charges at higher levels, as that could be a TINY bit overpowered, even though it costs an arm and a leg manawise... they could make it so that the level 20 summoning could only hold a spell that is level 20 or lower. Then the level 29 summoning could hold any spell of level 29 or lower, etc...Always only one charge though, regardless of level.<P>This would limit its potential for abuse and also limit its power tremendously if Verant thinks that would be necessary to balance it. Also, you would be unable to store level 24 spells until you reach level 29, likewise with level 34, and 44, thus limiting it in those spell circles.<P>Another variation would be to simply make them store mana itself. Increase the casting cost GREATLY and let it hold say 100 mana at level 20, 200 at 29, 250 at 39, and 300 @ 49.<BR>Casting costs could be twice the amount stored. The amount stored at each upgrade is approximately the cost of one DD spell for that level, actually a little less. This would not require the process of charging, it would be a one spell deal. Maybe even make this variation non no drop, so that you could give away your mana? (although at a 1:2 ratio which is poor, but still a good deal for party members) Still lore so that each member of your group could only have one at a time. That would make the wizard VERY group friendly, WOW, love that idea!!!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>Instead of everyone bugging the enchanter for clarity and the mage for staves, they could actually bug the wizard for something other than a TAXI RIDE!!!!!!!!! woo hoo  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>Medding afterwords would suck big time of course, but who cares as long as my group WANTS me! Also remember these still POOF if you zone with them in inventory or log out.<P>I can just see everyone asking their group wizzy for a "mana battery plz" hee hee, that would just tickle me pink  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">. <P>This would be cool because it is better than the staff that mages summon because it doesn't eat hp. But it doesn't make the mages spell useless either, because you could have one of each! One mana orb and one staff = a good supply of emergency mana when you need it most.<P>I feel like I just gave birth or something, haa haa haa.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Heh, kinda funny, your two reasons. Magicians are the summoners and shamans are the potion makers and yet, both classes get to do basically the only thing a wiz can (or is supposed to) do: DD (and in the case of mages, do it almost as well or better, depending on your level...).<P>No offense, but I don't think your reasons are very sound ones. If this won't happen because magicians are summoners, then why can necros, shamans, enchanters and shadow knights summon pets? And why can druids, clerics (and anyone else I'm missing) summon food/water?<P>And as far as shamans and potions..I really don't see how the two conflict, if these were made no drop (which I definitely think they should be). The ability for a wizard to store one of his/her OWN spells in no way diminishes the usefulness of having other, non-wizard spell-potions. Trust me, you could give a wizard 5 of these things with Ice Comet stored in them, and I guarantee he'd still pay good money to have a sack full of SoWs.<P>Anyway, this is all just a bit of fun, wishful thinking. Heck, they don't even feel there is a problem with the wizard class, why in the world would they even consider giving them a new spell?<P>Nintik Fiddlefest, Arch-Wizard of Jwor's Army (Prexus)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
