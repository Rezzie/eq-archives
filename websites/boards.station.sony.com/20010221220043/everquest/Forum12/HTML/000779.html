&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>About these lists:<P>First and foremost, understand that this is only a list of concerns to be brought to the Live Team.  This is not a list of promises, and I'm certainly not telling you that any or all of these items will be changed or implemented.<P>Also, there are three types of items that I don't have listed here.  Epic Quests, Magic Resistances in Velious and Mid-level quests.  Those three items were mentioned by enough classes that I've pulled them out for separate examination.<P>All items are currently marked with NONE for status.  Obviously we've already started working on some items, you've seen the lists from the patch messages on the Test Server.  I will be updating the status for items early next week to reflect those potential changes and with any responses from the team.  I just wanted to get these lists out to you fresh.<P>I want these lists to be final as you see them now, but I know there will need to be changes made.  So this list is not final.  But if you want something added to or removed from the list, please be convincing about the change.  At this point I don't want to tack on too many more items, since the team is already reviewing the original list.<P>Thanks for the input so far.<P>Alan<P><BR>Necromancers:<P><BR>ITEM:  Ignite Bones.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Despite the coolness factor, this spell can't really be used on the big raids because it suddenly pulls the enemy out of range, and by the time you relocate your range, one warrior could conceivably do more damage than the spell is going to do.  The best solution is to make the skeleton match the target in body type and size.  If the skeleton can’t be sized, then perhaps remove it and find some other cool way to make sure that the spell 'sticks' to the target to prevent chain casting and to make it more than just another DD.  Or, give it a longer recast time instead of the ‘sticky’ thing.  This would give value to multiple necromancers in a group.<P>STATUS:  None<P>NOTE:  Any change to this spell should also be made to Chill Bones (55).<P>---<P>ITEM:  Lifetaps.<P>DESCRIPTION:  The number one request is to allow Lifetaps to land on the big monsters.  A necromancer uses these spells, at least in part, to fuel there mana transfer spells.  Allowing them to land on the big encounters would make them much more useful for doing damage and for transferring mana, and would help them feel more useful in the final encounters on raids.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  DoTs and corpse poofing.<P>DESCRIPTION:  This affects everyone.  Hopefully this is now much improved, but I’m not taking it off the list until I’m convinced.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Mana transfer.<P>DESCRIPTION:  If the Lich series bug is fixed, then perhaps a 2:1 transfer rate might be a fair change.  Reducing the effectiveness of the hit point regeneration for necromancers will also lower their ability to transfer mana.  Necromancers would like to see this ratio raised in any case.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Infusion.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Make infusion targetable. The necro might still see it as a 'worthless spell', but if another caster wants to sacrifice their experience for 1000 mana, then might actually cast this spell.  Otherwise, those Essence Emerald’s will only be used for raising the dead.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Defoliation.<P>DESCRIPTION:  There seem to be plenty of plants that this just doesn't work on.  Certainly this spell needs to be limited in its use because it is overly efficient against one monster type.  But it might be worthwhile to evaluate the things that are not considered plants that maybe should be.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Track Corpse.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Broken spell.  Is it going to stay that way?<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Lich Series.<P>This series of spells is broken.  It is more powerful than it should be.  It takes the necromancer's hit points and turns them into mana.  It was calculated at a certain ratio to be 'in balance'.  Unfortunately, these spells were adversely affected by the reduction of damage to spells used by players on players.  This also reduced the hit points taken from the necromancer by Lich spells, so that the ratio of mana gained for hit points lost is nearly 1 for 1 (instead of about 3 for 2).  This is a bug that was left alone because it would be a 'nerf'.  In conjunction with a serious look at the entire class and the balance of all the classes, this series needs to be looked into and a decision should be made.<P>Other ideas for this line would be to allow it more stacking (with Clarity and Heal over Time spells).<P>There is also some question as to why there are two Lich spells at level 60.<P>STATUS:  None<P>NOTE:  Series includes:  Arch Lich (60), Demi Lich (60), Lich (49), Call of Bones (34), Allure of Death (20).<P>---<P>ITEM:  Trucidation.<P>DESCRIPTION:  This is the 1100 point life tap that requires an essence emerald and has a 10 minute recast.  The next weakest lifetap does about 750 points.  The suggestion here is that this spell be unresistable and do more damage.  The high cost of the reagent and the long recast time, are very limiting factors for the spell, even if it were unresistable.  It also might allow the necromancer a lot more leeway against the big opponents, doing some damage and also restocking their hit points for more mana distribution.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Pets and Fear Immunity.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It makes some sense that undead pets would be immune to fear.  Again, this would help the necromancer do more at the end of a raid.  Perhaps only the highest level undead pets would be immune to fear.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Stacking Bug with Splurt.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Heart Flutter, Asystole, or Cessation will stick if Splurt is cast first, but Splurt will not take hold if they are cast first.  Seems like a bug.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Summon Companion.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Giving this to magicians requires consideration about giving it to necromancers (and all other pet classes).<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Screaming Terror.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It seems that Screaming Terror is not overwritten by enchanter mesmerization spells.  It also seems to work on NPCs that are unaffected by those same enchanter spells, making it a bit more powerful than enchanter mez.  Also, it appears that it was intended to be a fear spell that also wiped the hate list, but it wasn't technically possible to make it work that way when the spell was first introduced.  If this is so, perhaps now it is possible to make it (or some new spell) work that way.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Sedulous Subversion.<P>DESCRIPTION:  The ratio of mana transferred with this spell seems to be worse than the previous spell in the line, Covetous Subversion.  That seems like an error.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>STATUS:  Coffin Availability.<P>DESCRIPTION:  There appear to be no regular coffins available in Necromancer/Shadow Knight guilds other than Neriak.  They should probably be available elsewhere<BR>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Spell Availability.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It seems that there are no 49th level necromancer spells available on vendors in Paineel.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Shadowbound.<P>DESCRIPTION:  The previous spell in this line stacks with regen buffs and Skin Like Nature, but Shadowbound does not.  This seems like a bug.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Component Usage for Summon Corpse.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It seems that if you duck during a casting of this spell you can prevent the component from being used for a failed casting, otherwise it is used up.  If the component is supposed to be used on a failed casting, then it should be used up, regardless of the character's movements.  If not (and this seems to be the proper course of action), then the component should be used only upon successful casting.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Spell Icons.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Most of the icons for necromancer spells are the same black skull on a red background.  It sure would be nice if there were some new icons to help distinguish one spell gem from another.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  59th Level Pet.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Many necromancers think that this pet is not much stronger (if at all) than the 56th level pet, and the cost of use is higher, so most just use the 56th level pet.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Dead Man Walking.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Necromancers would like a spell that has all the benefits of Dead Man Floating except the floating part so that they can use it in places where levitation does not work.<BR>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Rare Spells.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Chill Bones, Devouring Darkness, and Quivering Veil of Sarn seem to be very rare, perhaps too rare.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Cannibalize and Mod Rods.<P>DESCRIPTION:  These two items should probably be checked to make certain that they are not also affected by the PvP damage reduction change.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Group Dead Man Floating.<P>DESCRIPTION:  This is a spell that seems to be universally wanted by necromancers.<BR> <BR>STATUS:  N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.<P>---<P>ITEM:  Temporary Animation.<P>DESCRIPTION:  A new spell idea.  It would return a character to life for two minutes, at which time they will take lethal damage and die (again).<P>STATUS:  N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.<P>---<P>ITEM:  Possession.<P>DESCRIPTION:  An idea for a new spell that would allow the necromancer to possess his pet and play him like a character, while his own body crumples to the ground and remains helpless.<P>STATUS:  N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>2 things.<P>Darkness only spells like Quivering Veil and Levant should have their darkness to cast only restrictions removed.  This didn't make your list and should have.  Quivering Veil is basically the level 50+ upgraded to the level 20 spell harmshield.  If it is felt the other effects of quivering veil are too powerful, remove them and just leave it as an upgraded version of harmshield...with an 18 second/can't be stunned component just like divine barrier (cleric) is to divine aura (cleric also).<P>2ndly, screaming terror.  From someone that knows..having an enchanter of high level and necro.  ST does not let an enchanter overwrite it with their mezzes.  Probably should.  ST DOES NOT mezz monsters that an enchanter can not mezz.  The no stun/no mezz flag like with giants...makes ST just as inoperable as it does enchanter mezz.  Other than fixing the overwrite problem, the spell is fine as is.  It lets me with a full set of +cha equipment...'sorta' be an enchanter in a group on a horrible pull when one isnt available.  It's still highly risky and I can max keep 2 monsters mezzed...if lucky and wearing my high cha gear.<P>Screaming terror originally was a fear spell...and memory wipe/blurr.  It was also at first castable outdoors and inside, later changed to inside only.  It was modified to its current state after every necro pointed out it's basically nothing but a train maker.  You used it..in a dungeon, it didn't give a message if the blurr component worked or not, and several minutes later you had all of lower guk come looking to eat you.  Thus it was made into it's present form.....a sorta 'ghetto' mezz as we call it.  Not as good as the real thing, but can pass in a pinch.<P>Mindreaver *</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Why the Targetable FD isn't present here ? I think it was BY FAR the best improvement Necro can have to find a group and to be usefull in it. Who cares about a group DMF while we can cast it (one by one, that's true) on anyone, IN or OUT of the group !<P>Please, can you make our FD work as it should and make it clear aggro ? it is very boring to be forced to LD then coming back in dangerous zone without any clue of what is around...maybe clear aggro after several minutes but please, do something.<P>Track Corpse just works perfectly to me and is the only one I use now to recover corpses (with a Circlet of Shadows, this is a great spell...invisible to 85% PoF mobs).<P>Please, add target FD (call it what you want) to your list, it is a really great idea !</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The main reason you and others are most likely wanting the change, is that necromancers can solo extremely well and therefore level too fast.<P>Since the issue is leveling, why not leave the 3/2 ratio on the level 60 lich/spectre form, and 'fix' it for the lower levels?<P>Thus leaving necro's mana gaining capabilities the same for those that are 60 and have raid uses for mana, and if you still feel the need to 'fix' lich, make it affect those that are using it to gain exp faster, since that is your reasoninig.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Let's stick with Abashi's plan when this lich issue first came around. NO PLAN TO CHANGE IT. Mana transfer is nice for a tight situation... To make that a main task would totally suck. I would rather ppl suck it up and live with our transfer spells that we have now rather than get turned into a manapump. We will let u land your life tap on Uber_Mob_00, so now we screw lich and give you a lame manatransfer spell so someone can put your mana to real use... Bad idea IMO. <P>The other changes mentioned seem reasonable, "IF a necros place is to be a manapump..." That has to be the lamest job/duty I have heard yet. Why don't we leave it as a nice spell to use for down time issues or used in a pinch, etc.. <P>Seems like this talk brought more issues to light but I think things are going down hill from here. Necro needs slight changes. NOT duty changes. <P>Everyone complains of the useless spells that waste essence emeralds. Here is your chance to make a NEW spell that would make us able to do dmg to Uber_Mob_00, withOUT changing the life of every necro in the game! <P>Lex</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Wasn4t it a Necro Balance Thread ? Don't nerf others just because we "have" to be nerfed.<P><BR>---<P>ITEM: Screaming Terror.<P>DESCRIPTION: It seems that Screaming Terror is not overwritten by enchanter mesmerization spells. It also seems to work on NPCs that are unaffected by those same enchanter spells, making it a bit more powerful than enchanter mez. Also, it appears that it was intended to be a fear spell that also wiped the hate list, but it wasn't technically possible to make it work that way when the spell was first introduced. If this is so, perhaps now it is possible to make it (or some new spell) work that way.<P>STATUS: None<P>I am most of the time the second mezzer and I NEVER saw any mob I can Mez that Chanter just can't. The ability to Chanter to Overide mine would be great. An upgrade would be helpfull too (shorter recast time, not used for Solo ability and REALLY helps Chanter)<P><BR>---<P>ITEM: 59th Level Pet.<P>DESCRIPTION: Many necromancers think that this pet is not much stronger (if at all) than the 56th level pet, and the cost of use is higher, so most just use the 56th level pet.<P>STATUS: None<P>Yes and no. YES, lvl 59 pet is far too poor for that cost but NO, it is not the only one ! You've choose to give us pet with lower lvl range than Mage's ones (despite the fact they already have much more pets that are really touhger) bur our pets have'nt the whole class abilities (my lvl 53 pet still keep aggro because of its cast, the monk only used Flying Kick, no other Monk ability). They don't have enougth HP too.<P><BR>---<P>ITEM: Rare Spells.<P>DESCRIPTION: Chill Bones, Devouring Darkness, and Quivering Veil of Sarn seem to be very rare, perhaps too rare.<P>STATUS: None<P><BR>Hum...is this list exhaustive ? For example, the lvl 56 pet is UBER RARE !<BR>---<P><BR>PS : Possession would be cool too, just give opportunity to play different ways each day  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/redface.gif">))<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"The best solution is to make the skeleton match the target in body type and size"<P>That's not the best solution.  That leaves the spell nonstacking, making only ONE (1) necro able to cast it on a creature at a time - all others get "your spell did not take hold". The BEST solution is to remove the skeleton effect entirely, since our dots are too slow to be used in most grouping situations.  The hideous recast time already makes this a poor damage output spell compared to mages and wizards and druids.<P>I also did not see DOT stacking in your list.  If 2 wizards can nuke a mob for 2X damage, and two mages can, and two druids can, and two clerics can, and two enchanters can (assuming the non-wizards can even hit it with spells), why cannot the same be true of necros?  Please, (PLEASE!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> bring this one to the attention of the team.  The further you go into the game, the more you take part in large encounters.  Larger encounters = more necros = all but one necro left with essentially nothing to do, because "your spell did not take hold" on the few dots that might make sense for us to use.  Two necros stacking two 1000 pt dots (over 1+ minute) is no more powerful than two wizards nuking for 1000 pts in 5 seconds.  Just make the spell not stack with the same spell from the same necro.  But it should stack with the same spell from *another* necro.<P>"Many necromancers think that this pet is not much stronger (if at all) than the 56th level pet"<P>Heck, it is not much stronger than the *49* level pet.  Most necros would be happier with just a simple linear upgrade of the 49 pet, in exactly the same way we've been getting every since level 1.<P>"but if another caster wants to sacrifice their experience for 1000 mana, then might actually cast this spell"<P>In much the same manner that Keanu Reeves might win a nobel prize in molecular biology.<P>I hate to say it, but your list seems to carefully ignore all the suggestions that went by aimed at improving groupability of necros, by making more than one of us useful at a time.<P>scr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am now completely disheartened after reading this list.  The majority of the well thought out arguments made by necros of all levels have been ignored.  Why not compile a complete list of things necros have suggested to take to the team rather than just the ones you personally will consider?<P>Whatever happened to the suggestions for self-only ports to a few select locations, targetable FD, pets with abilities actually related to their con level, esssence emerald modification suggestions (so someone might actually use them) and some form off DD upgrade in the 50s?<P>I've read through the other class talk summary lists and in the vast majority of them there is at least one post which says this is fantastic and thanks a lot.  What you've brought back to us is a list you really already had along with a couple of very minor suggestions with a few token items thrown in to keep us happy but in effect have very little impact on our abilities - group DMF anyone?<P>As I've said before I think that if you were doing EQ over again you wouldn't have the necro class as you really don't seem to like us.<P>In any case I still don't think you've addressed the real issue which is do we actually fulfil our class definition?  We are meant to be the masters of death and solitary characters.  Therefore you'd expect us to have the best death related spells and the greatest soloing abilities.<P>Whilst it is true that previously we were the best soloers we have been nerfed to the extent that at least two other classes can solo better than us.  In addition some of our specialist death-related spells have been handed out to SKs and they even get a spell improvement which we don't (FD).<P>If you wanted to make us more group friendly then please give us abilities which fit in with our class definition - the ability to deal damage in some way related to death.  Where was the definition for mana dumper - I didn't sign up for that when I created my character and its not what I want to do?  Why don't you listen to necros - the majority of us want to get rid of our mana transfer spells if we could actually get some different spells in keeping with our class.<P>I think if you said to clerics that once they hit level 50 and they went on raids they'd no longer be able to heal others and that they'd be forced to tank (badly) they would not be very happy.  Likewise if a warrior was told that on a raid they were no longer allowed to hit a mob but just stand there and taunt and be hit whilst rogues did damage they would all be up in arms.  These roles are similar to the mana transfer spells you have thrown at necros to give them some grouping abilities.<P>Either give us a decent grouping ability in keeping with our class (targetable FD) or just scrap mana transfer skills and give us back the ability to solo better than other classes again.  You can't have it both ways!<P>As a final plea, again, please take all our concerns to the team - don't just take the ones you think are relevant!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>NOTE: Series includes: Arch Lich (60), Demi Lich (60), Lich (49), Call of Bones (34), Allure of Death (20).<P>And death pact (8)!<P><BR>ITEM: Pets and Fear Immunity.<P>DESCRIPTION: It makes some sense that undead pets would be immune to fear. Again, this would help the necromancer do more at the end of a raid. Perhaps only the highest level undead pets would be immune to fear.<P>/applaud.   This would be big, but you're gonna want to be careful with this.  Already, I can see a server's 50+ mage population going after fire dragons with fire pets (immune to fire aoe AND now immune to fear).  Nevertheless, if mages get it, necs should prolly get something similar.<P><BR>ITEM: Stacking Bug with Splurt.<P>DESCRIPTION: Heart Flutter, Asystole, or Cessation will stick if Splurt is cast first, but Splurt will not take hold if they are cast first. Seems like a bug.<P>Dont forget the Enchanter DOT line (all of it)<P>ITEM: Summon Companion.<P>DESCRIPTION: Giving this to magicians requires consideration about giving it to necromancers (and all other pet classes).<P>Not summon companion.  Mages are the masters of summoning, remember?  Pet sow, and pet fear immunity on the other hand, should definitely be considered.<P><BR>ITEM: Shadowbound.<P>DESCRIPTION: The previous spell in this line stacks with regen buffs and Skin Like Nature, but Shadowbound does not. This seems like a bug.<P>Actually, they made it so that you cant cast 2-3 shadowbonds on 2-3 other people and only have one effect on yourself.  The regen was a side effect.  We just use our 49- spell, which doesnt have these limitations.  Fixing would be good.<P><BR>ITEM: Spell Icons.<P>DESCRIPTION: Most of the icons for necromancer spells are the same black skull on a red background. It sure would be nice if there were some new icons to help distinguish one spell gem from another.<P>Definitely.  ESPECIALLY lifetap dots vs. lifetaps.  Lifetap dots used to be blue, but that was changed when the new color coding system was put in.  BAD!<P><BR>ITEM: 59th Level Pet.<P>DESCRIPTION: Many necromancers think that this pet is not much stronger (if at all) than the 56th level pet, and the cost of use is higher, so most just use the 56th level pet.<P>56 does more damage, 59 has many times the amount of HP.  59 is used when it is expected to take damage, IE soloing... but what 59 nec soloes?  The fear immunity on the 59 pet is a start to this issue.<P>ITEM: Dead Man Walking.<P>DESCRIPTION: Necromancers would like a spell that has all the benefits of Dead Man Floating except the floating part so that they can use it in places where levitation does not work.<P>Would be nice, but we do have resist poison, and (self only) see invisible<P>ITEM: Rare Spells.<P>DESCRIPTION: Chill Bones, Devouring Darkness, and Quivering Veil of Sarn seem to be very rare, perhaps too rare.  <P>Chill bones is NOT THERE.  Never seen it cast.  Darkness seems alright.  Zarn isnt there, but no one cares.. who uses an escape spell that can only be casted at night, and takes 10 minutes to mem the other version when it goes to day?  While we're at it, lev 29 defoliate doesnt exist.  Too bad, it might actually be useful (in three zones, OT and EJ/trak, out of the 120ish in the game).<P>ITEM: Group Dead Man Floating.<P>DESCRIPTION: This is a spell that seems to be universally wanted by necromancers.<P>heck yeah.  THAT is a unique ability.  Hey, if our ONLY thing we can do in veeshan's peak is DMF and mana dump, might as well make it group.<P><BR>Not bad.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>After reading this list I am in a state of shock. This list fails to address most of the concerns of the necromancer wanting to be an equal, relevant contributor to groups/raids post lvl 50.<P>I spent a good 4 hours composing a lengthy post on the official Necro class talk thread in which I laid out many solutions to making necromancers more useful in groups. I wasted my time obviously and so did most the the necros who posted with suggestions.<P>This list is a rehash of Absors initial post which started off the necro talk thread with a few additions. Many times it's mentioned in the list how Lich is "broken" and how we must have to pay for that (shades of Abashi). Yes folks another nerf will soon be upon the necromancer class. How convenient a time to reveal this. Yet most necros will notice that the infamous COB bug (call of bones) is still not fixed. How many necros have died due to this bug?<P>Absor with all due respect, *you* don't speak for me and *you* don't represent me or 99.9% of the necromancer community. We never elected you as our representative or spokesperson to Verant. You have a conflict of interest in that you work for Verant--how can you claim to represent the over 300,000 players and Verant at the same time? <P>I feel that most of the intelligent, thoughtful suggestions provided by necromancers in the official necro talk thread were simply *ignored* by you. I think the time has come for concerned necros like myself and others to write, phone, fax and email Brad McQuaid at Verant/Sony Interactive in San Diego, CA and make a personal appeal for the necromancer class to someone who seems to still care about this game.<P>If EverQuest is to have any future and longevity in the online gaming market it's going to need to setup an independent group of volunteer players (player council) that are elected by players who can sit at a table with the game designers at Verant and truly *represent* the concerns and issues each class has. <P>Finally, I am truly upset and angry with Verant because I just invested over 1,372 hours playing my necromancer only to find the class is useless post level 50 in the new reality of expansion EverQuest. A company that does not respect and appreciate it's customers is not worthy of my respect and continued patronage.<P> Dornette<BR> (soon to be retired) <BR> lvl 54 necromancer<BR> The Nameless<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I'm VERY pissed off that it has to come to this.<P>Take the whole mana transfer crap the hell outta our books.  We are NECROMANCERS, not mana babysitters.

</FONT><HR>Sigh, I typed an hour's worth of constructive criticsm in response to this thread but I managed to poof it.<P>But I'm not going to bother rewriting it because clearly Absor YOU ARE NOT LISTENING! You have just reiterated the statements made at the beginning of the Necro Talk thread and added a couple of minor details. Even with all these 'fixes' in place the necromancer class will still largely be crippled post-55.<P>It angers me that I and others wasted so much freaking time over the last few months posting to the various Necro discussions to try and bring you the reality of the necro class at high levels. You have blatantly disregarded these posts and continue with your blinkered approach to 'helping' the class.<P>I hope you didn't waste more than the 2 minutes I expect it took to put that pathetic list together at the start of the thread Absor, if it did you only wasted your own time as well as ours.<P>What point is there in reasoned debate when you simply don't listen? It's PATHETIC.<P>If you are prepared to read a post full of constructive critiscm and actually respond to it and not completely ignore the ideas in it like you have just done then let me know and I'll take the time to rewrite it. Until that time I'm not wasting any more of my time on the joke that is the Necromancer Talk.<P>/em walks off bitterly and slams the door<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>So this is it. After hundreds upon hundreds of post by concerned necromancers this is the list you come up with? Tell me, out of those hundreds posted, which did you read? The one you posted?  I really find it hard to believe anyone can be this stubborn.  You didn’t even address the issue of Essence Emeralds with their huge cost that just cannot be justified.  DoT stacking, not an overpowering thing, resists, why do you not want us to do damage to uber mobs? Pets that just look different post 50 and in are in fact no better and often worse.  You seem to be so blinkered you cannot accept the necromancers have been nerfed to the boarder of broken post 50.  OK Bin mana transfer spells.  Fix Lich. Improve pets. Address the Essence Emerald situation and let us do some damage.  To be honest I’m gutted, time to twink a tank, at least my necromancer can do that.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>hi absor,<P>sorry to say that,but the majority of your points are not the requests of high level necros in our talk.seems so,that you ignored alot of other qualified requests.<P>lets look at the list:<P>ITEM: Ignite Bones.<P>DESCRIPTION: Despite the coolness factor, this spell can't really be used on the big raids because it suddenly pulls the enemy out of range, and by the time you relocate your range, one warrior could conceivably do more damage than the spell is going to do. The best solution is to make the skeleton match the target in body type and size. If the skeleton can’t be sized, then perhaps remove it and find some other cool way to make sure that the spell 'sticks' to the target to prevent chain casting and to make it more than just another DD. Or, give it a longer recast time instead of the ‘sticky’ thing. This would give value to multiple necromancers in a group.<P>STATUS: None<P>NOTE: Any change to this spell should also be made to Chill Bones (55).<P>---<BR>i see no reason,why this spell shouldnt stack.it has a long recast time*12 seconds*and has a poor damage/mana ratios,so it wouldnt replace wizzard nukes in epic fights.only fixing its useless effect is pointless,when not 2 necros can cast this spell on a mob.<P>ITEM: Lifetaps.<P>DESCRIPTION: The number one request is to allow Lifetaps to land on the big monsters. A necromancer uses these spells, at least in part, to fuel there mana transfer spells. Allowing them to land on the big encounters would make them much more useful for doing damage and for transferring mana, and would help them feel more useful in the final encounters on raids.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<BR>lifetaps are essensial for necros(like dual wield for warriors,cc for chanters,backstab for rogues..)there are no reasons,why we shouldnt be able to land deflux*310damage for 200mana*on a mob with 300k+hp.thats wouldnt unballance the game more then the current damage output of ONE rogue in such a fight.<P>ITEM: DoTs and corpse poofing.<P>DESCRIPTION: This affects everyone. Hopefully this is now much improved, but I’m not taking it off the list until I’m convinced.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<BR>no discussion about that.please give a clear statement,that this bug is fixed.<P><BR>ITEM: Mana transfer.<P>DESCRIPTION: If the Lich series bug is fixed, then perhaps a 2:1 transfer rate might be a fair change. Reducing the effectiveness of the hit point regeneration for necromancers will also lower their ability to transfer mana. Necromancers would like to see this ratio raised in any case.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<BR>we dont need better mana pumping spells.all high level necros hate it to be mana batteries in raids and they hate also this spell-line.<P><BR>ITEM: Infusion.<P>DESCRIPTION: Make infusion targetable. The necro might still see it as a 'worthless spell', but if another caster wants to sacrifice their experience for 1000 mana, then might actually cast this spell. Otherwise, those Essence Emerald’s will only be used for raising the dead.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<BR>remove the ee or remove the spell.its useless now and noone will cast this spell,even when targetable.ee-spells are the most laughable idea in eq.<P><BR>ITEM: Defoliation.<P>DESCRIPTION: There seem to be plenty of plants that this just doesn't work on. Certainly this spell needs to be limited in its use because it is overly efficient against one monster type. But it might be worthwhile to evaluate the things that are not considered plants that maybe should be.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<BR>make this spell usefull at the big majority of the mobs in pog and also the fungies in sebilis.its a useless spell at this moment.when thats no option to make more plant looking mobs into plants,then remove this spell. <P><BR>ITEM: Track Corpse.<P>DESCRIPTION: Broken spell. Is it going to stay that way?<P>STATUS: None<P>---<BR>no idea about this spell.i dont use it since more then 20 levels.<P><BR>ITEM: Lich Series.<P>This series of spells is broken. It is more powerful than it should be. It takes the necromancer's hit points and turns them into mana. It was calculated at a certain ratio to be 'in balance'. Unfortunately, these spells were adversely affected by the reduction of damage to spells used by players on players. This also reduced the hit points taken from the necromancer by Lich spells, so that the ratio of mana gained for hit points lost is nearly 1 for 1 (instead of about 3 for 2). This is a bug that was left alone because it would be a 'nerf'. In conjunction with a serious look at the entire class and the balance of all the classes, this series needs to be looked into and a decision should be made.<P>Other ideas for this line would be to allow it more stacking (with Clarity and Heal over Time spells).<P>There is also some question as to why there are two Lich spells at level 60.<P>STATUS: None<P>NOTE: Series includes: Arch Lich (60), Demi Lich (60), Lich (49), Call of Bones (34), Allure of Death (20).<P>---<BR>the rate is ok imho.look:we risk our skin to get mana faster and thats,why we should geta  big reward by getting more mana back then clarity or just medding.its a risk/reward ballanced spell now.BUT,when you want to nerf it,then let the cob and alure of death at their current rate.it would calm down all the people,who dont play 5xin the week and have low level necromancers.<P><BR>ITEM: Trucidation.<P>DESCRIPTION: This is the 1100 point life tap that requires an essence emerald and has a 10 minute recast. The next weakest lifetap does about 750 points. The suggestion here is that this spell be unresistable and do more damage. The high cost of the reagent and the long recast time, are very limiting factors for the spell, even if it were unresistable. It also might allow the necromancer a lot more leeway against the big opponents, doing some damage and also restocking their hit points for more mana distribution.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<BR>useless spell at the moment.noone casts this spell.remove all ee spells except the convergence or remove the ee as a component.<P><BR>ITEM: Pets and Fear Immunity.<P>DESCRIPTION: It makes some sense that undead pets would be immune to fear. Again, this would help the necromancer do more at the end of a raid. Perhaps only the highest level undead pets would be immune to fear.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<BR>making the pets fearless isnt a big advance,because most of the mobs use powerfull aoe dd spells,which kill the pets in 10 seconds.raise the fire/poison/cold resistance of the high level pets,so they are usefull.actualy they are only usefull against a very few number of meele boss mobs with no aoe dd and in few zones with a average pathing.<P><BR>ITEM: Stacking Bug with Splurt.<P>DESCRIPTION: Heart Flutter, Asystole, or Cessation will stick if Splurt is cast first, but Splurt will not take hold if they are cast first. Seems like a bug.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<BR>necromancers dots should stack more.they loose in damage/mana ratio to dds in the high levels,espacialy after the dot-nerf.when we are deep in sebilis,the dots make only 66%damage,what makes them useless there.also,we need faster dots.we are the masters of dots?then we should get more then ONE fast dot(EB is our only usefull dot indoor and,when we have a shaman in the group,we cant use it and must switch to this slow dots)<P><BR>ITEM: Summon Companion.<P>DESCRIPTION: Giving this to magicians requires consideration about giving it to necromancers (and all other pet classes).<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Screaming Terror.<P>DESCRIPTION: It seems that Screaming Terror is not overwritten by enchanter mesmerization spells. It also seems to work on NPCs that are unaffected by those same enchanter spells, making it a bit more powerful than enchanter mez. Also, it appears that it was intended to be a fear spell that also wiped the hate list, but it wasn't technically possible to make it work that way when the spell was first introduced. If this is so, perhaps now it is possible to make it (or some new spell) work that way.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<BR>chanter cc spells should overwrite st,BUT from what i see here,you are thinking about a st-nerf here.we need a upgrade of this mid 20er spell.that will be in line with the philosophy,that people group more.actualy,we depend on ONE class for cc.i mean the chanters.giving us a upgrade wouldnt add anything to our solo-abilities and also would eliminate this situation,that 5 men sit at the zone and wait 2 hours for a chanter.<P><BR>ITEM: Sedulous Subversion.<P>DESCRIPTION: The ratio of mana transferred with this spell seems to be worse than the previous spell in the line, Covetous Subversion. That seems like an error.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<BR>high level necros hate this spell line.nothing more boring,then giving your mana to others,because you cant use it.<P><BR>STATUS: Coffin Availability.<P>DESCRIPTION: There appear to be no regular coffins available in Necromancer/Shadow Knight guilds other than Neriak. They should probably be available elsewhere<BR>STATUS: None<P>---<BR>remove the coffins or make them lesser expensive.clerics make a free ressurection.why should we pay 80pp for a component for conjure corpse or 180pp for summon corpse?that makes no sense to me.<P><BR>ITEM: Spell Availability.<P>DESCRIPTION: It seems that there are no 49th level necromancer spells available on vendors in Paineel.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Shadowbound.<P>DESCRIPTION: The previous spell in this line stacks with regen buffs and Skin Like Nature, but Shadowbound does not. This seems like a bug.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<BR>let this spell stack with all other healing/buffing type spell.that would make us more group friendly and wouldnt add anything to our solo ability(DAMND,soloing is DEAD after 54)<P><BR>ITEM: Component Usage for Summon Corpse.<P>DESCRIPTION: It seems that if you duck during a casting of this spell you can prevent the component from being used for a failed casting, otherwise it is used up. If the component is supposed to be used on a failed casting, then it should be used up, regardless of the character's movements. If not (and this seems to be the proper course of action), then the component should be used only upon successful casting.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<BR>remove it.simple.<P><BR>ITEM: Spell Icons.<P>DESCRIPTION: Most of the icons for necromancer spells are the same black skull on a red background. It sure would be nice if there were some new icons to help distinguish one spell gem from another.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: 59th Level Pet.<P>DESCRIPTION: Many necromancers think that this pet is not much stronger (if at all) than the 56th level pet, and the cost of use is higher, so most just use the 56th level pet.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<BR>actualy,the 59er pet loose sometimes to the 49er pet.this pet is only a 49er pet in specter form.the 51er mage pet eats our 59er pet.is that intended?i know,mages should be superior pet-casters,but our post50er pets need a power boost badly.they loose to every 50+mage pet easy.<BR>there is NO difference between our 53er and 56er pet now!<P>ITEM: Dead Man Walking.<P>DESCRIPTION: Necromancers would like a spell that has all the benefits of Dead Man Floating except the floating part so that they can use it in places where levitation does not work.<BR>STATUS: None<P>---<BR>just let this spell work in all zones.like kk for example.would make us more wanted and wouldnt make any changes to our solo abilities.<P><BR>ITEM: Rare Spells.<P>DESCRIPTION: Chill Bones, Devouring Darkness, and Quivering Veil of Sarn seem to be very rare, perhaps too rare.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<BR>the drop rate is a joke.we depend on our spells.meeles dont do that.i know 60er necros,who raid trakanon and the juggers constantly and dont get the 59er pet spell.also,i know 58er necros who use the 53er pet,because they cant get the 56er one.<BR>ITEM: Cannibalize and Mod Rods.<P>DESCRIPTION: These two items should probably be checked to make certain that they are not also affected by the PvP damage reduction change.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Group Dead Man Floating.<P>DESCRIPTION: This is a spell that seems to be universally wanted by necromancers.<P>STATUS: N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.<P>---<BR>no ned for this spell.would be a nice add on,but its not vital.<P>ITEM: Temporary Animation.<P>DESCRIPTION: A new spell idea. It would return a character to life for two minutes, at which time they will take lethal damage and die (again).<P>STATUS: N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.<P>---<BR>would be a joke spell,like 22 of our post 50er spells.<P>ITEM: Possession.<P>DESCRIPTION: An idea for a new spell that would allow the necromancer to possess his pet and play him like a character, while his own body crumples to the ground and remains helpless.<P>STATUS: N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.<P>no need for any action here imho.another fun spell,but not realy vital.<P><BR>hope,you will read some of the excellent posts in our talk topic and add this points to your list.<P>bye</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Awww.  2 things really disappoint me.<P>1st, it seems that Verant thinks that better mana transfer is preferable to necros than the existing lich mana/hp conversion ratio.  I think this conclusion is completely wrong, except for the highest level necros who's primary function is to go on raids and who accept the necro's inability to do damage.<P>2nd, it would have been nice to let necros have conjure corpse at a lower level, especially since shadow knights have received summon corpse as well.  Almost universally, other caster classes have received the upgrade to a spell before the hybrid receives the same spell as the caster class.<P>Lastly, although many of the existing bugs appear to be on the list, I don't see very much effort in terms of "balancing" necros.  The vast majority of concerns, other than what to do on raids has again been swept aside, without any discussion or analysis.<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here are some errors I noticed you made on your summary:<P>*ITEM: Mana transfer.<BR>*DESCRIPTION: If the Lich series bug is fixed, then perhaps a 2:1 transfer rate might be a fair change. Reducing the effectiveness of the hit point regeneration for necromancers will also lower their ability to transfer mana. Necromancers would like to see this ratio raised in any case.<P>Actually, Necros would like to see this spell line removed completely.  It is not in character for a Necro to have this line of spells, Necros don't want to use this line of spells, this line blurs class destincion.  Necros don't want this at all!<P>*ITEM: Infusion.<BR>*DESCRIPTION: Make infusion targetable. The necro might still see it as a 'worthless spell', but if another caster wants to sacrifice their experience for 1000 mana, then might actually cast this spell. Otherwise, those Essence Emerald’s will only be used for raising the dead.<P>The main problem with this spell is that it only gives 1000 mana.  To us or anyone else, this is simply not enough mana to justify taking someones life.  For the cost of this spell, it should completely fill the target's mana, if not completely fill a whole group's mana.<P>*ITEM: Track Corpse.<BR>*DESCRIPTION: Broken spell. Is it going to stay that way?<P>This spell works.  Unless it is not working as intended (and as players, we have no idea), you can take it off your list.<P>*ITEM: Lich Series.<P>Actually many patches ago, this issue was addressed.  It was stated that Verant was aware of this issue, and had decided to leave it alone.  You can take this off your list.<P>*STATUS: Coffin Availability.<BR>*DESCRIPTION: There appear to be no regular coffins available in Necromancer/Shadow Knight guilds other than Neriak. They should probably be available elsewhere<P>They aren't available in the Necromancer/Shadow Knight guild in Neriak, but rather they are in the Cleric guild.  They are also available in Plane of Sky.<P>*ITEM: Group Dead Man Floating.<BR>*DESCRIPTION: This is a spell that seems to be universally wanted by necromancers.<P>A lot of Necromancers said they don't need this.<P>Did you read the same class talk thread that I did?  There are SO many things there that you failed to address I can hardly believe it.  PLEASE go back and read it again.  I'm not joking, this list is way off.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Essence Emeralds - if you make Truc completly non-resistable this would STILL be a bad concept - please remember 1 EE means more DOWNTIME for another live player.   Why not make sacrifice a spell we can use with like 100dmg that has a 5% chance of giving up an emerald - OR making EE's buyable for 200pp a pop... *sigh* this will not go away no other class must pay a price like this for a spell, and if you insist on the price we'd better get spells that are 100% verifiably the best spells in the game that do more than 2x over what other spells (the best other classes get) do.  Why do *I* have to pay 1k to someone to kill them and waste that players time for a spell that another class can cast for 300 mana flat. (and mine has a 10 minute recast time etc. etc. etc.) Our 1k lifetap is even castable off an item (Trak's tooth I think) with no EE cost - so I am totally flaberghasted.<P>Mana Transfer - *NOTE* This is a downtime reducing spell ONLY - it is NOT what we want to do on raids... it is not usefull for raids ... we didn't say we wanted this more - we were COMPLAINING that this is the ONLY usefull thing we could do - NOTE that *usefull* does not mean *needed* or *wanted*.  No raid or group or guild wants a necro for a mana stone.  The response I get when I bring it up is "nice for a CR to get clerics ressing more often, but why don't you start a cleric or warrior?"<P>Pets -  All of our post 50 pets are weak on the HP's ... we don't hit as hard as mages and our pets don't have the special attacks that mages pets get - but we would like our pets to either have better hps or get a defense upgrade (skele's in *other* games do take 1/2 damage from things)...<P>Night only spells - nice concept - but useless really.  There really is nothing more to say - if you don't change the nightime only Quivering will never be mem'd by necros anywhere over harmshield.  Any other changes to the spell are a waste of development time.<P>Dead Man Floating - regardless of other things make this spell work in Kedge Keep.  It's the only zone we looked forward to for this spell (breath underwater for other people) and you would have thought the spell was designed with this zone in mind - but we can't use it?  No new spell necessary - nothing drastic - make this spell work in kedge keep.<P>Ignite Bones - This spell was supposed to have a stun component - the illusion was never meant to be a 'cool effect' but rather a limitation to keep necros from chain stunning with damage - which would make necros too overpowered in a group - now that it does not stun the spell is just another nuke (still less efficient than any other nuke spell that any other class gets with a long cast and recast time) - this spell should be made into just another nuke with no illusion and the ability to be cast by many necros on the same mob.  If not then the stun component should be put back in as the confusion caused by the illusion would not cause problems if the stun took hold.<P>Lich and other spells that take health for mana - too much has been said on this issue already - it's clouding over the real reason we are here.<P>Coffins - Make these avaialable in the gnome city - in the iksar city - and in freeport - this would make the game much better.  It might be nice to see the spell summon corpse drop off of other mobs in the game also.<P><BR>Conjure corpse - our hybrid class gets the summon spell at 50 - we should get the upgrade (Conjure) before or at the lvl they get the base spell.<P>Long acting DOT spells - At lvl 34 we get a spell (Venom of the Snake) that does 500 damage in 30 secs... we should get an upgrade to *this* type of spell in the 50's that does 1.5k dmg in 30 secs - dots don't work in fights as they are over too quickly - we need a fast acting dot to cast durring grouping.<P>Damage in general - This is caster specific and I know you are looking into the issue - however it must be noted that all caster damage does not scale past 50 - the 'ultimate' wizard spell sunstrike does 1.8k dmg... that's only 600 more than the spell they get 9 lvls ago.  My opinion on the matter is that you tried to scale spell damage in the same manner you did 1-50 (the 39 spell vs the 49 spell has the same damage ratio upgrade that the 49 spell to the 59 spell does)... this would have been good if you had balanced the monsters and hp's that way - however you didn't .. while you used the same linear scale for PC's you used a log scale for the monsters... <P>- Ckorik</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Bah, anyone being happy as a mana pump is an ass, necro is BY FAR the weakest class 55+. I only use my necro now when I need to farm for my twinks. I know ALOT of people that have quit their 50+ necros & many more on the verge of quitting. Maybe Verant will finally get a clue when they see nobody 55+ playing necros anymore.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am concerned about the proposed changes to Lich. I play a 46th necro, and think that the health-to-mana transfer is fine. It's not overpowering IMHO.<P>I know he said that the list isn't concrete or anything, but I'm still worried that it's going to be nerfed.<P>And why should it be nerfed this late in the game? I remember when the issue came up a long time ago, it was dropped because (IIRC) Verant felt Lich-series was fine the way it was.<P>Necros definitely need some enhancements, but leave Lich alone for goodness sake. <P>Just because the necro community has requested a few upgrades to make themselves more group-friendly doesn't mean one of our best abilities needs to be nerfed.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Have been here since Beta 1.<P>Necromancers need a boost X5 as they are right now in the 50+ game.<P>If they do a Lich Series nerf -X2, then they had better make the boost given be X7.<P>If not, I will bid EQ my final farewell.<P>Just because I have had the most fun running a Necromancer up to a high level (and I have done all other classes by one to 45+) does not mean that I will accept a sudden cessation of fun at a certain point.<P>Ridiculous to think that I will keep paying.<P>Just got billed for a 3 month cycle, have written down my "due date" of next billing on calendar.
