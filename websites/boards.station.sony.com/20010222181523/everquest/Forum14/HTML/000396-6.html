</FONT><HR>There are many ways dwilgar, you're just thinking in a box.  Don't say it can't be done, be creative.  I suggested several possibilities earlier in the thread, no deep tinkering with the way stats work, just some adjustment to the stat buff spells - each spell seems to be able to have up to 4 effects, take advantage of that and add effects to stat buffs in addition to the actual stat improvment.  Simple and effective.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Stow- This is the shaman discussion. Please take your wizard issues back to the Int Caster board. All your doing is introducing your own issues (selfishly) into the discussion of someone else's class.<P>Absor- Please, please, please take a look at stat buffs. If other classes are going to have almost equal, equal, or better abilities of ours in other areas (Slowing: Enchanters, Resist Debuffing: Mages, Speed Enhancements/Regen: Druids, HP/AC buffs: Clerics, not to mention that fact that many pieces of melee armor now have our buffs on them as right-clickable effects), then please allow us to see that there is indeed some benefit to what you say we are best at: Stat Buffs.<P>Almost every shaman agrees that stat buffs are minimally useful as they are now, and not worth the mana spent for what they do. So we slow and perform back-up healing duties, and debuff resists if a mage isn't present. I try and avoid stat buffing as much as possible, because I see absolutely *no* noticeable improvement in the tanks performance (possible exception is small-race rogues and strength). During Vox raids, I'm asked to put my stat buffs on everyone as the first 4 buffs (people call them the "crap buffs") so that the important buffs, like HP/AC/Speed/Clarity buffs, last longer before being dispelled. Why is this, if my buffs are so useful?<P>And finally, as far as Iksar and JBone armor goes, perhaps things are different on my server, but I've played into the low 50s as a Barbarian Shaman now without having a JBone Bracer, and I'm perfectly viable. Iksar shaman are capable of doing the same (especially with their superior regen). It may make things easier, but all shamen can still do fine without it.<P>Tyric Bjornande<BR>Shaman 51<BR>Tallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, I'll go through it point by point I think, the way I see it. I must admit I'm a bit skeptical about the possibility of any serious corrections though, I think the shaman class' decline into mediocricy was predetermined at the release of Kunark - but we'll see.<P>Stat buffs: these aren't very useful, due to gamedesign. Nothing to do about that I think. Shamans are fated to be the kings of buffing something that isn't very useful, and it's too late to change. Just remove the group ones, they are basically just taking up space, and focus on fixing the things that matter, i.e. the spells we actually rely on.<P>Healing: Moving Superior Heal to 51 and reducing the resist rate is good. A Remedy-type spell at 55 is good. Giving druids an upgrade to Superior Heal but not shamans is not good. Torpor has far too many restrictions to be considered equivalent to a big direct heal.<P>Pet: the final shaman pet should be able to soundly defeat the final SK pet. Currently, that isn't the case. This is very wrong.<P>Debuffs: shamans need to get their edge back. We used to be the undisputable masters of debuffs, but now shamans really can't offer anything that enchanters and magicians can't offer. One of our most important defining abilities as a class is lost, or at least in serious jeopardy. I would like the debuffing edge back please, in the areas where shamans used to be special. One way to do that would be to introduce a special kind of slow spell that no one else has. I'll leave that to you to figure out, although I personally would love a very low resist (but limited) slow spell. And giving magicians the Malise-line was a mistake from the beginning - giving them the upgrade so close to shamans is an even bigger mistake. Please make sure there is an actual edge here for shamans, I was under the impression that this was a shaman spell line.<P>Damage spells: there is at least one damage spell missing. Four spells just don't hack it, I see no reason why shamans, who used to be on par with druids in damage dealing, are left out in the cold like this. Some kind of useful upgrade at 52-53 would be nice, I was thinking a debuffing disease DOT of some sort. And since shamans now have a poison DD line, it would be nice (and logical) if there was a conclusion to it post 50.<P>Resist rates: Shamans are resisted a lot, it's a fact of life. My only problem is the resist rates of the DOTs, they are resisted too easily considering that they aren't particularly powerful/efficient compared to spells like Splurt and Winged Death. Druids got improved stackability of DOTs in the expansion, perhaps shamans deserve adjusted resist rates?<P>Drop rates: many of the 55+ spells are too rare, especially the DOTs. Our brother class druids can waltz into shop and buy all their important damage spells, while shaman ones are so rare that most shamans don't have them, which obviously has a crippling effect. I assume shamans are balanced with these spells, correct? Well, in that case they are negatively unbalanced without them, so make them available please.<P>Avatar etc: Personally, I don't care much about these, because I never expected them to be good. Clerics and enchanters are the real buffers, and I was fine with that. I did debuffs. But I do find it somewhat troubling that what is supposed to be the "jewel" of the shaman spell list is in actuality less useful and desired than a level 44 enchanter buff (Boon of the Garou). That is surely wrong. <P>Alchemy: Don't know, don't really care. I never expected it to be great. My only complaint here is that it is far too expensive compared to what it actually produces. The resale value of the stuff should be comparable to jewelry.<P>Thanks for reading</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR> The problem isn't that stat buffs dont do anything they do,but they do not give us enough additional benefit to justify the lack of other spells we get beyond 50.<P> If they increased benefit but made them uncastable on &gt;7 levels below casters that would be great.If they give us something really useful pre level 55 that would be great</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Planes:<BR>Iksar Shaman currently have no reason to do the Planes of Hate or Fear.  I do them by choice to help out my guild mates, but its obviosly somewhat depressing when there is nothing you can use in either plane save one item.  <P>Armor:<BR>Also obviously the problem with hate armor is that Iksar shaman cant wear it or Jaundiced.  I love my 54th Iksar shaman, and would never quit playing him because of gear, but it would be nice to be able to use the same items that my fellow troll, barbarian, and ogre shamans can use.  If the Rune Etched or Jaundiced is too much of a problem, then I suggest to do what you did to create an Iksar Totemic equivalent. Which, by the way, I think was a very nice thing to do on Verants part.  At the time it was introduced the armor was lower stat-wise than what I currently used, but still very nice to see progess of any type in this area. <P>Thanks,<BR>Hemloch 54th Shaman<BR>Rodcet Nife <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just a few last minute Suggestions: <P>Group Shrink:<P>this is one of our fun Spells, Making it work anywhere is already on the list, A group version would also be nice<P><BR>Group Sow and regenerate line of spells: <P>While I can understand why druids would get the exclusivity on the group camoflage, water breathing and other utility spells. But Sow and regenerate are Primarily Shaman Spells. I'm basing this on the fact that Shamen get these spells earlier. Why Does the shaman not have the group versions of these spells at least at the same level as druids, Or perhaps even earlier. <P>You can get away with just stat buffing the classes that need it. Everyone in a group Is going to want to be Sowed, and often regenned. I started a Shaman to have a character that would be group friendly, But when you consider that once I've finished buffing myself, And eventually my pet, I barely have the mana to buff more than one or 2 other people... I'm left with the impression that when compared with the druids that get group versions of almost all of their buffs before level 49, that the shaman wasn't really meant to be a group player.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Dwilgar, are you Absor operating under an assumed name?<P>There have been numerous suggestions in the Shaman Talk threads for improving stat buffs that would not involve a massive revamp of code, nor imbalance the game.<P>They don't have to change what stats fundamentally do nor rewrite all the item codes. They just have to alter what the shaman buffs themselves do.<P>Examples:<P>Shaman str buff increases minimum damage per swing by a certain percentage. Does this mean that any item which adds str should do this? No! Only the buff.<P>Shaman agi buff reduces damage taken by a reasonable percentage. Does this mean that any item which increases agi should do this? No! Just the Shaman buff.<P>Shaman dex buff increases the chance to hit by a certain percentage. Does this mean that any item which increases dex should do this? No! Just the Shaman buff.<P>You get the idea, I hope. Again, there is no need to revamp massive amounts of code, nor every stat improving item in the game, nor change the way stats function. Only the buffs need to be fixed (i.e. made more useful/effective).<P>Now, would you care to explain how changing just the shaman spells to have additional benefits would require major reprogramming and unbalance the entire game?<P>Regards<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Let me say something akin to saying that the emperor has no clothes.  I think that you guys have it all wrong.  I don't think each class should have a separate and distinct skill.  I think that groups of classes should have separate and distinct skills but that within that group, we should have one that is clearly the most superior and others that provide more flexibility to play more than one role in groups.  <P>What do I mean by this?  I think that all healing types (yup, that's the group we get put into, not the buffing group, not the debuffing group and anything that takes focus off that is diverting from the main function of the class) should be able to heal really well.  The cleric can be the best but the druid and the shaman shouldn't be very far behind.  Why?  Because often when you are grouping, you don't have the luxury of putting together the perfect group.  You need people who can move from one role to the other to fill in holes.  I mean, you only have six slots to fill and the odds are not good that you will be able to put together that fabled warrior, cleric, enchanter, shaman/druid, (fill in other tank here), (fill in caster here).  Maybe when you hit level 50 and all your grouping is planned.  After spending hundreds of hours getting to that place.  But for most of your EQ career, you will be in groups that need people who can shift from one role to another.  <P>If they need a healer, I will heal.  If they have a healer (and frankly there arn't that many clerics around so I heal alot) I cast debuffs, mostly slow or malaise depending on the make-up of my groups.  This helps the healer by reducing the number of hits and can really be thought of as a way of healing by avoiding folks getting hit. <P>If I'm not needed to heal, I cast DOT's or DD.  Or I have even tanked when occasionally stuck with a group of all casters.  I'm not a fabulous tank but I can pitch in in a pinch.  And there is a lot of value in that. <P>The point is that I fill many roles in the group.  I trade that off by not being the best healer. I just need to be good enough at healing for groups to want me as a healer but not good enough to displace a cleric if they have one.    The tradeoff by playing a shaman though I am not the master of healing, I am pretty good but I can also be useful in other ways.  <P>I think you need to rethink the role of the groups of classes and think how they can complement each other.  Buffing isn't what we do.  There is no buffing group.  We are healers.  We mainly do things to heal or avoid people getting hit.  The stat buffs don't do that.  Tagar's Insects and the Mal line do.  These are the things we will be wanted for.  That and being able to fill holes in the group when needed.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It's awfully wrong from a roleplaying perspective to give druids better direct healing than shamans, because all the druid races already have clerics or easy access to clerics. Shamans on the other hand ARE the clerics of the less developed races. If any class should be close to cleric healing capacity it's shaman, not druid. Giving only druids Nature's Touch is upsetting to say the least, unless they seriously boost Torpor to almost full Celestial Elixir-status to compensate.

</FONT><HR>Lets deal with some of this misinformation:<P>Stamina --&gt; Riotous Health:  Upgrade gives 10 more stamina, duration is increased 9 minutes to 72 mins.   On a level 54 shaman, 10 stamina give 27 hps.  On a level 60 warrior it give 54 hps.  Upgrade costs 50 mana (which is way out of line and the only real problem with this spell - should be 20 mana)<P>Center : level 9 cleric hp/ac buff (same line as heroism, so no stackable with heroism).  For 40 mana give 85 hp, 6 ac, lasts 27 minutes.  <P>The only problem with the comparison of these two spells is that the MANA cost of the STA buff upgrade is messed up.  If it was the proper 20 mana increase the STA buff is an excellent spell.  To top it off, stamina buff STACK with all other hp buffs.  Of all the stat buffs shaman have, this is the best.  One last thing, is our stamina buff as good as heroism, nope it isn't.  Should it be?  Shrug, I don't know.<P>Regarding the requests for making the stat buff lines "useful".  If you want neat effects, just ask for new spells, don't turn a line into something it isn't.  It would be nice to know though if some of the suggestions offerred are even possible; things like increased crit %age, increased dodge %age, % damage mitigation, +x damage to each hit.  From previous Verant comments I would think not, but their track record of knowing what is possible is flaky and they have never been particularly forthcoming at discussing the mechanics of how things work.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A question regarding your comment on the JB effect Rameus.  Personally I like the AC component of the buff - very nice.  I am just curious - does the damage component really get shaman summoned?  Damage shield damage is unassigned damage, so if you don't do anything else, will the damage shiled damage put you on the hate list and thus make you a possible summon target?  Just curious since I rarely get hit (triggering the dshield) without having done something else to put me on the hate list.<P>Dwilgar<BR>Luminary of Rallos Zek<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Dwilgar asks a valid question - <BR>Lets say it is possible to code an effect on the strength buff that actually increases tank damage by x% per hit. My question is keeping the current duration and mana cost, what should x be? Would you be happy if x was 3%? 5%? 10%? Just curious. I am trying to understand what the expectation is and whether it is realistic. <P><BR>I think it would be great if strength did, in fact, raise damage per hit by some percentage.  It clearly does not do that now, by design.  If strength raised the magic number for the melee types, then it would have this effect, and it would be very noticable and easily measured.  It would stand out on the graphs!<BR>So, thanks for the support Dwilgar - I too, think that strength should be changed to affect the magic number, rather than the chance of hitting for maximum.<P>My answer?  hmmh - increasing the magic number by even 1 per 10 pt increase in strength would be a lot - probably too much, and really impact the tuning already done on dam adn del for one handers and two handers.  An increase on 1 in the magic number for ever 20 points of str increase?  more reasonable, imho.  An increase of 1 in magic number for 30 points of str increase is not enough.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am bored so to make it even clearer ...<P>Well IMHO Buffs are not fun. Many claim useless too nowdays. I didn't like them when I started my shaman, and I dont liek em now either.<P>IMHO we should have a 3-tier role as Shamans: <P>1st tier - DOTS and DEBUFFS. <BR>============================ <BR>We should have better DOTs post 50, earlier, and with a revamp on their drop rate. Why not buy them even, if druids can buy their ultimate DD ! <BR>One of the MAIN factors (for me and for many other players) that made shaman so attractive pre RoK were the DOTs ! <BR>Also we should remain best DEBUFFERS in game ! With also accesible spells. <P>2nd tier - Heals & Buffs. <BR>========================= <BR>Shamans are not clerics. Hence the new spells and fixs we got is just fine ... <BR>Our Buffs are fine. Let Ench excell here. We do what we can, as mentioned I dislike it anyway. <P>3rd tier - Pets. <BR>================ <BR>Well I hope they give us some improvement, but its fine as it is. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yes i think for an UBER BP that is pathetic 16ac and a 3dmg shield? come on give us a port or something on it. I don't even cast bramble coat after the first time stats are sweet along with the other BP's but the effect is not worth a cp and in effect takes a slot of another much more usefull buff once on it lasts forever and can't even click it off /sigh<P>As for someone listing above about using ebolt over nife, yes i do all the time as Getting nife is harder the getting the BP what is with that? I have yet to get the spell along with many fellow shamans on the server. So the only good spell we get for 56 is realistically non-attainable <P>celerity = long cast time and we can't melee for crap so whats the point? in a group chanter will have that covered, if no chanter keeping up with slow and speed is not going to happen.<P>Acumen= great spell 3 in 1 is nice saves slots for other buffs but losing a bub to cast on 1 person is not really worth casting unless on downtime.<P>Paralyzing Earth = 2 mins? well maybe 1 in 1000 just don't cast a damn thing on the mob and try and make sure the other 5 in your group do the same. In effect lvl 14 root&gt;paralyzing earth<P>Bane of Nife = Great spell if it can ever be found.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I know this premise has been stated before, and no matter what stats mean at the present...why can verant not take a look at our buffs in a logical and UNBIASED manner?  <P>OK...my take on the literal meaning (not what Verant has made them mean in game) of the available buffs would be that STR means you can hit harder and carry more, DEX means you are more accurate with your weapons of choice, STA means you can fight longer, AGI means you can dodge better, HPs mean you live longer, AC means when you get hit it doesn't hurt as bad.<P>Why, Absor, can you guys not make the buffs mean these things?!?!  <P>I mean...OK STR buff allows you to carry more...why not have it up the max damage possible for the buffed PC?  Say a players STR is 150 and their max damage is 100.  Now, with Shammy buff (I know these numbers aren't right but bear with me...stream of thought here  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  his STR is 190.  That's about a 27% increase in STR.  So now the PC can carry 190 stone in equipment/loot.  Why not allow this buff to increase max damage too?  With this his new max damage is 127.  That's not very unbalancing and which group wouldn't want a shammy for his buffs with that one.<P>Now DEX...DEX now only slightly increases your chances of procing a weapon (according to popular belief anyway) BUT, the literal meaning of DEX is to be more accurate with your hands.  That would mean...to me anyway...that the PC's DEX should change the chances of hitting or missing.  So, back to the numbers if a PCs DEX is 100 and it is buffed to 140....that's a 40% increase, so why not giving the PC a modified ability to hit with the buffed DEX taken into account?  Or even better, how about increasing the chances of the PC striking for max DMG?  Think about it, someone with high DEX will hit his opponent in a critical location more often than someone with lower DEX...<P>AGI...same story...give the PC a better chance of dodging/parrying the attackers blows.  Using the same reference above...a 40% increase in AGI should equate to a modified chance of using a classes melee disciplines.  Why this adds a few points of AC makes no sense at all to me!  OK, maybe with higher AGI...to make the numbers work Verant had to play with the AC of the character to show a benefit of the attackers blows brushing off and therefore not hitting for the damage it could have hit for...BUT, that's still not agility in my mind....<P>STA...why this one adds HPs is beyond me...actually makes very little sense at all, but why can STA not increase the overall STA pool for the PC?  Wouldn't this make more sense?  I mean there are other spells in the game that increase the overall HP and mana pool...why not allow this?!?  <P>The way I see it, Shaman control these areas of buffs...others do other areas such as HP and AC and for that matter Mana much much much better (you know, the buffs that mean something)  What would be so hard about implementing these changes and having our buffs desired in a group?  As it is now I am not even asked for buffs anymore much less any of these.  My assignment is to keep everyone SoWed and to try to slow the MOB.<P>Absor, if this is something that is un-doable please let us know why!  If you haven't decided yet...let us know that too!  You have yet to mention stat buffs on any of your "lists" and if you read back through the shaman lists, 75% of the posts were on this subject!  Let us know something...please!<P>Thanks for everyones time for bearing with one shammys take on what stat buffs "should" mean.  Also, thanks for bearing with me through my stream of thought...   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Szago<BR>44th Season Shaman<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
