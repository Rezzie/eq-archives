</FONT><HR>One of the things other than the taunt,epic weapon, & cobalt issues which I would like to see worked on is the Bind wound skill cap.<P>From lvl 25-50 what does a warrior have to look forward to skill wise (other than disarm at 35)? The melee skills, disarm, taunt, and of course the trade skills if you havent maxed them out yet with the exception to Bind wound.<P>I play a lvl 45 Dwarf warrior and I have started threads in the past about it. But Bind wound IMO should have the skill go up before lvl 50... more like around say lvl 35 let it start goign up in skill considering it has been maxed at 100 since lvl 20. <P>From lvl 20-49 Bind wound: Maxed at skill lvl 100 doing 25HP per bandage for a maximum of 50% of your HP.<P>My suggestion is this. <BR>Lvl 35 let skill start advancing to do more hp per bandage and climbing in skill but not be able to Bind wound for more than 50% until post 50. I dont see where that would be in any way unbalancing considering I could have had a pally,shaman, or monk come and bandage me for up to (I believe this percent is right) 80% of my full hp doing 85hp per bandage.<P>As I see it it is somewhat unbalancing that classes who can heal themselves (ie: Paladins-heal spells, Shamans-Heal spells, Monk-Mend). But a warriors only chance is to be lucky enough to either be rich enough to afford a ceremonial iksar cheastplate or a fugi tunic for regeneration.<P>just my 2 cp,<P>Kanammer Stonetooth<BR>Dwarven warrior of the 45th Blade<BR>Leader of "Guardians"<BR>Vallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

With the new vell armor (such as the POG set and ry gor) they can surpass the ac of any other race in the game with their built in scale armor (not to mention regenration).<P>Second it seems the best shoulder item in game is only usable by medium races.

</FONT><HR>1)  Agreement with more AC and HP.  I've met many monks with higher AC than my 52 warrior... Shameful.<P>2)  Main reason for my posting... Warriors are perhaps the most useless class on their own (with possible exception of Rogues, but this isn't a Rogue topic).  While I understand that everyone can't solo, it can get painfully boring sitting around looking for groups.  At higher lvls a warrior can't even take on many green con mobs.  This is just plain mean, imagine the embarassment of a 50+ warrior being chased out of Lake Rathe by a lowly Hill Giant.  My suggestion is this... Warriors should take half the damage they currently take from any green con mob.  This would at least save much embarassment for the warrior, and would give them something to do when the grouping get's slow (make a little extra money killing HG's, allow them to actually wander through some dungeons so maybe they wouldn't have to wait for an escort to get to the meeting room on Naggy raids and such).<P>3) Reduce agro range from low con mobs on warriors so we don't have so much trouble wandering around.<P>Repeat main point:  Warriors should take half damage that they currently do from green con mobs.<P>Thanks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, I think warriors are pretty badass. With some of the gear you can get with enough time spent doing high level dungeons, a warrior can get his AC to around 1200 before buffs. And then you add in regen tunics and jboots and cobalt legs and helms and all the other items that give warriors all those minor utility spells that can make a high level warrior SO much less dependant on others, and you have a pretty decent charachter that defies any single class definition. <BR>     The problem then becomes that every warrior has to aspire to this in order to fully come into their own. I don't mind having to put an assload of time into my charachter in order to get him to fully evolve, but you can't bank on any warrior ever reaching that pinnacle. Other things need to be put in to allow a warrior to be more self-sufficient at lower levels. I wish I had some good ideas, but I really only have a few...<P>1)Bind wound. Druids can get it up to 200 at level 40. Monks can get it up to 250 at level 45 (I think). Those are the only 2 classes I really know much about aside from warriors, so I don't know who else can, but why can't warriors? It caps at 100 at level 25 or whatever. Where is the rationale in that? I understand that a monk has the abilities of a healer and such, but what class in the game is gonna spend more time healing themselves up, and therefor should be better suited at it? Something needs to be done about this.<BR>2) You don't wanna hear this, but I have to say it. The epic quest for warriors is no where near an equal risk vs reward. Not even close. Maybe if there were some nice interim items, but there isn't one. And you gotta kill some very badass mobs to get anywhere, just so you can get a prestige item? It's not worth the time. I know this will probably never be changed, and I don't see it as being broken or anything, but I felt a responsibility to say that. <P>3)Disciplines are pretty damn cool. That was a great idea that should have been in the initial release, but maybe wasn't thought about at the time. Do another round of em. Warriors have to be able to evolve into something more then they are right now. A warrior doesn't change between level 1 and level 50 in regards of his abilities. He never learns to track (which you MIGHT be able to justify in a roleplaying sense) he never learns to heal better, he gets new skills that are useful, but that are part of the evolution of any melee charachter, not just that of a warrior. Rangers get new spells (I know they are hybrids, just an example here) rogues get new poisons (an evolution of their skill as rogues) and every other class gets something except warriors and monks (but monks start out with a ton of great stuff anyways  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">) I wish I had some ideas here, but there has to be some way for a warrior to evolve within his own abilities and not just through the pursuit of new gear.<P>5)Make taunt work better. Right now there is a check based on the level of the mob. Eliminate that. I don't care if you're a dragon or a goblin, if I come up and tell you your mother is the scum off a cows balls, you're gonna hit me. AOE would be nice too, maybe a post 50 change of some sort. But if you do that, make it so that we can also taunt just one. I can't tell you how great it would be to be able to taunt that mob off the cleric without having to switch targets. Seems like something that might naturally evolve of a warriors abilities  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>Shelrabbi<BR>Tallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hello,<P>   I am a 53 warrior, I find the class wonderful.<BR>However taunting needs to work better. I believe instant refresh at level 60 would be nice. Perhaps even lower. However, at 53 I want to be able to protect my group. AE taunt would be great.<BR>We need to be able to keep mobs on us better than anyone. Phantom damage sounds really cool. All missed attacks count as damage/hate. But will not effect the mobs health bar. Then cutting taunt refresh time in half. Or just give us double taunt skill. Doing this I think will help keep the mobs on us. This is the most important warrior issue I see.<P>The reuse time on disciplines is quite long. I agree those 10 second disciplines should be set to 15 minute refresh time.<P>Thank you </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have quit playing this game for now, but I expect to be back by july, with new warrior and all. This are some of my suggested changes even tough the warrior class is very well balanced.<P>- More dmg output, not a lot, just a little more, still lower than monk/rogue, this could be achieved via more frequent critical hits or increasing atk rating.<P>- A skill called endure wounds, a pseudo-mend with a longer recycle time.<P>- Increasing the duration of mighty strike   discipline so it can actually do what its supposed to do.<P>- The ability to regen faster, regardless of race.<P>- Some sort of instill doubt battle cry (If I were a mob, I would frankly be more scared of a 7 foot tall leg-chopping brute than of a small dude showing off his little dagger).<P>- Oh yeah and fix that crippling blow thing, where you score life saving blows for half the dmg you do normally. <P>You slash a mountain giant tump for 67 points of damage.<P>A mountain giant tump hits YOU for 70 points of damgage.<P>Brakar enters a berserker frenzy!<P>(many swings later)<P>Brakar lands a crippling blow!(25)<P>(weapon used: worn crescent axe, dmg 24 delay 40)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, I think the vote is overwhelmingly in favour of boosting the Taunt skill! Frankly, for the good of all, I think the all the taunt-capable classes should get a boost... but Warriors should get a much bigger one.<P>Here's another idea: How about a weapon specialization skill? A Warrior above a certain level (let's say 30, just 'cuz it's in the middle) gets additional bonuses with a weapon type of their choice, which increases incrementally as their level in the specialization increases. They get extra attack, damage, and maybe a bit of haste.<P>Overall, I think that Warriors are pretty balanced... but the issues surrounding the class are more of along the lines of how changes would affect other players (ie. better taunting would keep casters alive longer, increased combat skills would allow more room to improve hybrids).<P>Tamarrion Barithdotter<BR>Knight of Truth<BR>Paladin of Mithaniel Marr<BR>Champions of Norrath<BR>The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First of all, I know that everyone really appreciates you guys at Verant at least having these Class Talks, even if you may not necessarily do anything with them.  Also, everything I'm mentioning has already been stated, but I'll restate it for the hundredth time because I agree and think it's important as well.<P>Warriors are meat-shields, plain and simple, so make Taunts more effective.  Perhaps a new taunting skill at 50.  Also the AoE Taunt is an EXCELLENT idea...perfect for the split second before an Evac or that nasty train you're bringing to zone.  Who cares if I die from it?  That's what Rogues, Clerics, and (god forbid) Necromancers are for. =)<P>Speaking of taunts, two other improvements I'd like to mention have to do with 2H weapons and shields.  If I know I really need to taunt a_nasty_mob01 I'm going to use dual wield.  Hands down.  It's the most effective way to keep mobs on us.  Using a 2H doesn't always do as well.  Using a 1H and a shield isn't worth it at all.  In fact, the only classes that use shields to any degree are SKs and Pallys.  (I'm not counting WIS casters because it's usually a CGS and they want the +9 WIS)  Make using a 2H or a shield give an extra bit of taunt so we can have a bit more variety in using different kinds of weapons.  My Warrior is a weapons collecter of sorts, but I find myself using one set of weapons all the time, because if I don't I can't taunt as well, and my group suffers for it.<P>I haven't even started on my epic, and I am positively DREADING it.  I'm extremely disappointed that it's just a mindless FedEx quest...go get the super-rare items X, Y, and Z.  Combine them.  Do the same thing two more times.  Voila, your Nasty Sword of Awesomeness.  No story?  Nothing cool like the Shaman epic, where you become a part of the story behind the City of Mist?  The team who did our epic couldn't have taken long to design it. =P Yeah it's next to impossible to get, but who wants a weapon that any schmuck with a guild can obtain?  C'mon Warriors, I thought the point of Epics was that only a few would get them.  But I digress....<P>Third point...healing potions.  Make them non-stackable.  Make them very expensive.  Make it so if we -sneeze- we're interrupted.  Just let us have them, PLEASE!  It's been stated time and time again that EQ has to be the only fantasy game without healing potions.  I don't want them so I can solo with them...but having Superior-Healing-In-A-Bottle sure would help out in those nasty situations.  It won't diminish the role of healers in the game by any stretch of the imagination, but give us a bit of latitude when left to our our devices.  Maybe even raise the cap for Bind Wounds a little earlier, but I'd rather have potions.<P>Sounds like a lot, Absor, but it's not.  Warriors are probably the most balanced class in the game.  I'd concentrate on all the other classes that, in my opinion, Verant really, really, really messed up.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sorry if these have been covered allready, but i didnt feel like reading through 4 pages of posts heh, your alot more patient then most of us Absor =)<P>Ok well, lets see...<P>Taunt, We all know that this has been a problem for most warriors, some know tricks and techniques to be able to keep a mob on them. Against some mobs, taunt simply will not work.<P>Epic, Probably four pages worth of people complaining about our epic, and for the most part, at least one/third of problem is correct. The 2h Version, JBoW, is decent enough, its not crap, but its also far from overpowering. Its the 1h versions that get the most attention, personally i like the off hand 1h, decent ratio, nice stats and the extra buff that comes in handy with the extra ac dex and atk bonus. Its the main hand weapon that needs a improvement, 14/24 is a decent ratio, but for a main hand weapon, it either needs the dmg increased or the delay lesson'd, for example, look at the ranger epic, almost the same idea.<BR>The proc is another thing that bugs me, it does not stack with the 2h version, ultimately forcing all warriors present at the encounter to use the same set up. We currently have 8 or so epics on my server and there is almost always at least 2 warriors present with them at each raid for the top guilds. A simple request of the debuffs stacking would solve this nicely, let us be able to choose which version we want to use and not hinder our ability to do dmg, 100 dmg dd or 175 dd is alot when it wont take hold.<BR>To answer a question you had before, what weapon would we use over our epic, its not so much another weapon, its the proc it does that makes it more desirebale to use over our epic. Willsapper, 13/20 procs a slow, slow is a HUGE taunt, very desireable over our epic, better ratio, better taunt, in exchange for stats. Heres another one, Scimitar of Lifestealing, 9/18 procs a 150 point lifetap spell, very fast and a nice ammount of lifetap, almost double that of a bloodpoint, very fast and added with it the proc makes it more useable then our epic, currently there is only 1 on our server /kick Zuko.<BR>Just a simple improvement on our proc for our main hand 1h weapon or a ratio increase is all we ask.<P>Masters of Meelee, this was said a long time ago, saying we are the master of all weapons, well look at peircing and we are not master of all, master of big sticks and big swords. Our peircing skill shoul equal that of our 1h 2h blunt and slash.<P>Long time ago, taunting was broken, but it was possible to keep a mob on you with tricks, pumice comes to mind. Instant cast of dispell, very very useful to piss something off when pulling, tagg with that a well timed kick taunt and slash right off the bat, you have nice agro built up right at the beggining of the fight. Then you nerf'd it, 4 seconds or so to cast it, which means you only get 1, and you have to stand still for a while, since warriors dont get channeling to make sure you can even cast it.<BR>Simple fix to this would be maybe changing the ammount of dispell from the 2 buff instant cast it used to be to a 1 buff instant cast maybe? or something along those lines.<BR>To me, the pumice nerf was the absolute worst nerf warriors have got since release besides the crit/crip nerf a long time ago.<P>Cobalt drops, they suck, but its not really a class issue, its a drop issue, really do need to take a look at the ammount of slayings it takes to get a peice of either a bracer or helm, bp and legs outnumber helms and bracers, sad.<P>HP, Velious mobs quad for 800, thats 3200 dmg per round, that takes aprox 70 percent of a fully buffed warrior's hit points, and with the impending donals nerf, its going to make it extremely harder to kill these uber mobs. Not impossible, but distinctly more difficult. Few more HP's wouldnt hurt and give us a chance to tank more then 10 seconds on a mob of that power.<P>Small request, make the eyepatch of plunder a instant cast instead of the 3 second cast it is now, the time it lasts makes it a pain to keep doing it, and if your already engaged in a fight, its impossible to rebuff it.<P>Also one more thing, the dmg bonus on the 2h epic doesnt seem to be up to key to say a truncheon of doom, it gives an extra +20 per crit, where as the truncheon gives 21, and they are both over 40 delay, 41 to 44 , dunno if that is a formula mistake or something, but it would be nice for the added bonus to take effect on our epic since the delay is 41.<P>Epic Quest, Chardok sort of sucks, specially with the blade being the only quest peice that isnt a static drop, but i do see why, it really limits the ammount of epics that enter the game, cause the queen and the hand seem to be the only bottle necks in the quest, rest of it is rather simple.<P>Im sure im forgetting alot of things, but its all i had on my mind sitting here. <P>If you really want to see what warriors thing, log into a few servers and ask a few lvl 60' wars what they think, youll be able to get more info then just the people that post on this board, cause not all that many players actually post here.<P>Feel free to contact me in game if you like, im sure ill think of other improvements that could increase our functionallity<P>Btw, dont listen to thogg, especially about our class, please please.<P>Seri Du'Syth<BR>60th Warrior of Terris Thule<BR>Epic Dark Warlord Princess</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I know this probably wont happen, but it really should.  Warriors are, in my opinion, one of the 2 worst soloing classes in game, right next to rogues.  Not only can green cons easily kill us, and we cant solo things that casters 10 lvls under us can kill, but even if we do kill the thing, we have to sit on our butt for more than 10 min to get all the hp back.  What if casters got mana back at the same rate at lvl 60 as they did at lvl 1? That is how it is with warriors and HP.  Casters get meditate, so that they can get mana back faster, warriors should get a regen skill, so we get hp back faster.  Not all of us knew enough, or wanted to mess with the xp penalty and faction ascociated with Trolls or Iksars.  This would not unbalence the game, adding a regen skill that maxed out did mabey 15 a click or so.  It would just give warriors the slighest ability to solo at higher lvls.  <P>Another issue, why is our bind wound skill cap 100? That means we can only heal 25 hp a bandage.  When you have 1800+ hp, that is nothing.  It takes forever to heal up to the halfway mark, and uses nearly a stack of bandages.  Also, bandages are expensive, over 10pp a backpack.  At my lvl, that isn't a big deal, but it was a bigger deal back at lvl 20.  Currently, Bind Wound is the only skill that gives us the slightest hint of a soloing ability.  I know that warriors will never be able to solo worth anything, and that we will always be group dependent, but cant we at least have some ability? I cant always find a group, and when I cant, all I can do is sit on my butt. <P>Just one more issue.  Cobalt is the rarest of all the kunark armors.  It is the most expensive, and hardest to get.  If you could increase the drops a little or do something to make this a little easier, that would be great.  Compair Cobalt to Singing Steel, which every lvl 30+ bard has at least one piece of.<P>Just some thoughts,<BR>Sinorm 46th Warrior of Xev<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Warriors need a little bit of help in the solo department. I am aware that this game is based on grouping, and so I will make my suggestions accordingly.<P>1. Getting jumped sucks. Greens can smack a warrior around in many zones so badly that he will run, or die. With no self speed booster outside of SoW potions and Jboots running is pretty much death as well. No I am not going to suggest warriors be able to cast SoW. (But you thought I was didnt you?) Buy the potions or camp the damn boots.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">    What I will suggest is this. In 20 years of playing RPG's I have NEVER been in a fantasy setting that didn't have useful healing potions, until now. My suggestion, Shamans should be able to make a healing potion with a cost in materials around say 75 PP and it should cast Greater or Superior heal. (Note: I would like to see both, one for say 50pp and the other for 75) I know what your gonna say. "That will make clerics and grouping obsolete." No it won't. I know myself, and most other warriors are not that rich, not till we get really high level and start finding loot we can sell, so you can bet at 100pp a pop (Probable going price for a single dose potion) it won't be used three times in a fight to solo a Drolvarg. And when a warrior is rich enough, he will certainly have better things to spend cash on than a ton of these healing potions so he can solo his way to 60. What it will do is allow the warrior the possiblilty of surviving alone in a nasty area while traveling, and yes, maybe solo a few low blues while being bored and waiting on friends/groups.<P>2. Bind Wounds. Quite frankly, it sucks. I have been friends with a military man for about 10 years now, and he can tell you that thoughout history, soldiers have been better at tieing off wounds and applying field bandages than anyone else save of course medics(druids & shamans) and doctors (Clerics). It is part of your basic training. My suggestion, allow Warriors (and clerics) to have a higher skill cap in this area and allow them to bind self and others up to 65%. I suggest this in conjunction with the healing potions for those warriors who are nowhere near able to afford the potions. It will allow them to make it to a safe area, heal up a bit, and venture forth again without taking 25 mins to heal and possibly keeping a group waiting for them. (And pick-up groups will dump your sorry butt if you take to long getting to them.) Again, no real increase in soloing since if you try and bandage in a fight, your dead meat, no question about it, just a decrease in downtime when the unforseen happens, or you find yourself without a healer for a short while in a hostile area. (ie. You get jumped by a green Giant in FM at 39th level, you may kill it, but that goblin over the next rock will kill you for sure. Take 5 mins to bind up a bit, and you will most likely escape with your life and exp intact.)<P>3. Bind points. What about them? There aren't enough. Again, being realistic, I don't want to see warriors bound right outside Guk or anything, but one closer to remote areas like Burning Woods or Dreadlands would be nice. As to where they should be, I am sure the EQ live and/or tuning team can come up with that better than I could. My personal suggestion would be teleport Rings and Spires. Still remote, but offers a few more choices.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

You make that assumption because you dont see constant posts to the boards saying we need this or that.  WE ARE WARRIORS!  We do NOT cry like a druid when pricked!<P>However, as you did ask, I will tell you this. The time it takes to travel made me quit my warrior at 39th lvl.  I couldn't take it anymore.  Yes yes I know, you standard responce, get a port.  Bulls*#t!  I have run across entire continents asking for ports, on my way to retrieve a corpse, without any responce.  Not only do I have to run to where I want to fight, but should I die, 9 times out of 10 I am running more.  I was spending 1 hour running, half an hour killing, then another hour running for a corpse then time to log. I found I no longer enjoyed the game and quit for an entire month before starting a Necro.  Now that the "chosen" class!  Binding at various locations is not a "balance" issue.  Its the difference between the game being fun or a drag.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I second the suggestion to improve the effectiveness of taunt. As a warrior, we can do very little to affect the game for others like a caster can except when it comes to absorbing damage.<P>Nukers can nuke and stun, healers can heal, and utility types can buff and protect. It is rather disheartening to be in a lowbie type dungeon and see a train chase down a couple of helpless chars knowing that you would only be able to taunt or kill a small piece of the train in time.<P>AE taunt would be the capstone on a fine class. Hopefully it would be added in to the early levels, but with a ever decreasing fizzle/resist rate. AE taunt in Blackburrow / Infected Paw / Mistmoore would really help a lot. I would humbly suggest it appear at level 15 and improve 5 points a level or so (5*45=225).<P>As for truly balancing the classes (with respect to one another), warriors would need more innate resistances. Maybe +2 MR a level instead of +1 and +1 to all the other resistances per level. Doesn't seem like that would throw the uber encounters out of whack too much (+120 MR, + 60 others at level 60). I think all the resists would still be under half of max.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have noticed a few posts regarding Iksar warriors but do not think they went quite far enough.<P>People have been going on about how hard it is to get certain parts of the Cobalt armour. As an Iksar warrior this is not something I have to worry about.  I get the fact that Iksar apparently have better AC than the other classes so they cannot wear plate armour.  What I don't get is that there is no alternative for Iksar at higher levels.  As a mid level warrior you quest for Crafted.  For an Iksar you quest for Trooper Scale which while having less AC still has comparable stat etc bonuses.<P>But from then on out the Iksar are screwed.  I am getting conflicting reports about whether the Iksar can wear planes armour but that is neither here nor there as the chance of me getting to the planes is very small due to timezones atc.  This leaves cobalt and the new quested armour sets from Velious.<P>From what I have seen of the Velious armour, it is classed as plate and therefore not iksar wearable.  The best armour available seems to be Ry'gorr but that is only really a mid level armour and certain pieces are actually less AC than Trooper Scale so why change to it?<P>At the moment playing non-large clases as warriors is not greatest but at least all equipment options are open to you (as long as you have the str to wear them  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">). The same cannot be said for the Iksar.<P>As I have been on holiday of late I have been on in times of maximum and minimum server population on my server of choice, Erollisi Marr.  From what I can tell there are only 4 iksar warriors on that server who are lvl 40 or higher, and that includes myself.  Post 50 the reasons to play this race/class combo vanish rapidly as the ability to fulfill the role destined for the warrior (Meat Shield) can be better accomplished  by a halfling warrior than by an iksar.<P>I realize this is a forum for CLASS balancing but I feel that there should also be some semblance of balance between the races as well. Obviously a large warrior will have some advantage over a small one, but the inability to get any high level armour should not be the deciding factor against a race/class combo.<P>Brumfondl Majicthise<BR>51 Dark Elf Warrior<BR>Furballz Dasmiff<BR>40 Iksar Warrior<BR>Mugwump Piddlepuddle<BR>35 Ogre Warrior<BR>Squashum<BR>4 Gnome Warrior<BR>(ok so I like warriors)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I realize you normally don't want to talk about items in these threads, but I feel that one of the most unbalancing things about warriors is the high level gear.  The Cobalt armor and other warrior wearable armors that allow warriors to cast spells far beyond the capabilities of the hybrids classes of the same level and sometimes almost as good as the parent classes is far too unbalancing.<P>I recently heard "warrior buffing characters at the gate" in East freeport.

</FONT><HR>Having played a Barbarian Warrior from day one (almost 2 years ago).  The only thing that I want to say is.  Can you please make the stats (especially for warriors) mean something.<P>Dex doesn't do much as far as I can see.<P>Str again really doesn't do much.  There seems to be little difference in a str of 100 as there is in a str of 150+<P>Agi increases AC a little.<P>I have read many posts, and it seems to me that whether a warrior has a str of 60 or a str of 200, the difference is about 10 points of damage (on average).  It should be closer to 50 points of damage difference.   From what I have heard from higher lvl warriors, AC is king.  So why even have the stats in there?<P>Otherwise I am happy with the class.  (btw I am performing a little test with a dwarven warrior to see if the damage/str thing is true, and so far it is)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Some ideas:<P>1)  A warrior is supposed to be the master of weapons.  Yet SK's, Rangers and Paladins all have the same weapons skills and caps as warriors.  In my opinion if a warrior and an SK (for example) were wielding the same weapon, the advantage should be to the warrior, yet it is obviously not.  I would suggest that every 10 levels (15) or so, a warrior receives either a plus to damage (+1) or a minus to delay (-2 I would suggest) of a weapon he is using.  Thus, in the hands of a 15th level warrior, a 6/28 longsword would become 7/28 or 6/26.  This change is not major but would differentiate the warrior from the other hybrids, make them slightly more desirable in combat, but preserve their place in the overall damage-dealing rankings.  Monks would still outdamage the warrior overall, but warriors would still be the masters of armed combat.  <P>2)  Allow Berserk to be a selected ability much like Lay Hands or Harm Touch.  I would put it on the same timer as these buttons.  The warrior would get increased Str and Attack, decreased defense and the ability to land Crippling Blows for a limited amount of time.  This would at least allow the warrior something to think about during combat.  Every other class has a special ability that they must tactically use.  The warrior has nothing.  <P>3)  Add some new skill between the ultimate dead zone of levels 15-25.  Some ideas:  (A)  Staunch Wound -- an ability that allows the warrior to immediately heal the last blow landed  (B)  Iron Skin -- an ability that gives the warrior a minor defense buff  (C) Aimed Blow (my favorite) -- allows the warrior to land a critical hit but lose all attacks for the next round (timing for warriors would become crucial and give them another tactical choice)<P>Basically, in my opinion, the warrior is fairly balanced class, but misses out on those abilities that make him or her stand out.  All other classes must make tactical decisions, whereas the warrior, who should be the ultimate tactician, must make none.  Crits and Crips are nice, but are completely random.  Other classes get the ability to dual wield (rangers) and double attack (melee hybrids, monks).  Give the warrior something to prove that he is the master of combat.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Basically everything that has already been said is important to me.  Nillon's post in particular was a good one, check it out.<P>Some other issues I'd like to bring up or echo.  Weight of some of the armor is just too much for smaller races.  Not every warrior is a large race and it makes it difficult/frustrating.<P>Give small race tanks some reason to play those races.  We have no advantages other than not needing a shrink potion (cobalt bracers are so rare that those arent even worth mentioning to shrink) on outdoor raids.  No racial bonuses and for the most part inferior stats.. we miss out on a number of nice items too yet there are perhaps 3 or so items in the high end of EQ that are SMALL only (not this small/medium crap, SMALL only - dwarf, halfling gnome).<P>Raise our HP, big one.. with the nerf of the Donal's bp it will be even more important.<P>Biggest issue, taunt.  Raise our cap to 252, maybe that will make it more effective?  I dont know -- but DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.  Raise our piercing cap too to 252 since a number of nice weapons are found there.  We are weapon masters, not good at all weapons but simply above average at piercing!<P>Second largest issue, the rarity of the epic quest pieces.  You made cazic skin/slime blood drop every time (one or the other) so do it to maestro hand.  Fix the queen too.  We killed her 3 times the other day for no blades.. 8 hours in chardok for no blades when multiple warriors only need that (or that and the hand, surprise surprise) hurts.<P>Dorf</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>These really aren't balance issues. Being the benchmark and the best tank by default, I'd say balance really isn't a very big issue for us. However there are a few issues that should be looked at nevertheless.<P>&gt;&gt;TAUNT&lt;&lt;<BR>Taunt needs a bit of tweaking. As it stands now with the new 50+ taunting rules taunt still does not work at ALL on yellow or red mobs and it's just a little too weak with high blues. Make taunt a little more reliable on blues and have at least some effect on yellows and reds<P>&gt;&gt;SMALL WARRIORS&lt;&lt;<BR>Give small warriors a meaningful combat advantage besides just being small. Agility just doesn't cut it, as we've learned that agility is pretty much meaningless after you pass 75.<P>&gt;&gt;STAMINA ITEMS&lt;&lt;<BR>Make more items with good ac and stamina or perhaps a piece of "cobalt-ish" warrior armor that casts a mild stamina buff. It is very easy to boost strength without sacrificing ac with the current items out there. On the other hand items with lots of stamina and good ac are somewhat rare.<P>&gt;&gt;EPIC QUEST&lt;&lt;<BR>Perhaps revisit the epic difficulty vs reward. The difficulty should be toned down a bit or the epic itself improved.<P>&gt;&gt;DISCIPLINES&lt;&lt;<BR>Some of the disciplines are very poor and should be examined. Charge, Evasive, Precise, and Aggresive all come to mind in particular. I believe some people have posted details.<P>&gt;&gt;TWO-HANDED&lt;&lt;<BR>There is a need for better =&gt;warrior only&lt;= two-handed weapons. Why do I say this? The vast majority of the good two-handed weapons are shared by all the heavy plate classes (war/pal/sk). However, they are balanced in such a way that a paladin or shadowknight cannnot trivialize the advantage of dual wielding. This makes perfectly good sense. However, the side effect is that in the 50+ game, warriors have no reason to use two-handed weapons. By putting in warrior only two handed weapons that can compete with dual-wielding damage, 50+ warriors can have a little more freedom with their weapon choices.<P>&gt;&gt;IKSARS IN PLATE?&lt;&lt;<BR>Iksar warriors using Plane of Growth warrior armor is very iffy. One of the tradeoffs iksars traditionally make is they lose plate armor but have a natural AC bonus. Now pre velious, the gap arguably put iksar warriors at a disadvantage, but Plane of Growth armor gives them a huge advantage over all other warrior races and violates their "no-plate" restriction. My reccomendation is that there should be better non-plate armor available for iksar warriors than exists currently, but they shouldn't be able to wear identical top-tier armor like the softskins do.<P>&gt;&gt;INDO, COBALT, and VELIOUS QUEST ARMOR&lt;&lt;<BR>The Indo drop rate is rather poor overall. Yes I know it's all random and it could be merely a streak of bad luck, but after dozens of Hate raids, a pattern does emerge. The cobalt drop rate overall is a little low, specifically the bracers and helm are obscenely rare. Furthermore, the Velious quest armors are ridiculously difficult to get if you don't feel like trashing your faction in PoG. That just serves to punish good-race roleplayers and reward pure powergamers. Velious quest armor should be about on par with PoG armor, both in difficulty and quality.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The only "buffs" I can think of offhand that a warrior can potentially cast on someone else given unlimited equipment would be reckless strength, see invisible, and shrink. Fun, but that certainly doesn't devalue the buffs a ranger or paladin could cast. SK's, coming from a non-buffing parent class and owning self only buffs for the most part, don't really apply.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Everyone has mentioned the obvious for Warrior improvements: Taunt.  To do this it would make sense to have more Haste weapons available in the game for warriors, especially on the Epic Weapons.<P>One other thing people might not have mentioned is the useless spell on the Cobalt Gauntlets.  It's a level 4 Reckless Strength spell (maybe even level 1 for some classes).  Then the Cobalt Boots have another Strength buff but it actually lasts a while.  Why two spells both for str with one no one will use since it goes Negative on you???  I would suggest you think about changing the Cobalt Gauntlets to a Dex buff on par with the Strength buff from the Cobalt Boots.<P>Of course non-troll HP Regen is a joke (I play a DE Warrior - it's a tough race/class combo).  At level 49 I timed it taking upwards of 30 minutes to heal from Half to Full health.  Mana Regen for a level 49 INT Caster is like 3-5 minutes from empty with no regen effect.  10x longer for Health on a warrior is nuts.  There are not always healers to go around, trying to solo a blue as a warrior after level 35 means it takes ALL of your HPs.  A casual player (e.g., someone that works for a living and has a family) can not select a warrior as a class and expect to ever make progress.<P>Travel as a warrior is very slow (and if you die you usually travel naked, where fists are mostly useless as weapons, and there are no instant offense capabilities always available like still being able to re-mem spells as a caster prior to embarking on any run back to the battle area).  Maybe some sort of built in SOW for warriors in these circumstances (with no weapons or armor) would be useful and not change the balance of the game (since warriors have to bind so far away from the battle fields it takes forever for them to get back if there is no cleric to res the corpse - and below level 35 you are not always near a cleric that can res).<P>Rasky</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
