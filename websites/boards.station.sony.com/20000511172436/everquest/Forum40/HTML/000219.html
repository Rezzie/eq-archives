</FONT><HR>I don't even know where to begain with this. Any of you that have had any type of dealing with this GM will not even need to read on to know why he needs to be removed. I myself have had 3 different negative dealings with him on 3 different characters. He has 0 customer service skills, and lacks the understanding that some of our former GM's have had. I have found this GM to me VERY unpleasent to work with, and am at the point of placing a bounty on his head. At this point I am calling for our GM to be removed and replaced. I know MANY people that have had GREAT dealings with guides Ashriel, Grond, & Braydon. Why can't we get someone with the skills and dedication to the game that these guides possess? It is hard enough to have the server as crowded as it is, but adding Axgoreth to this mix is just deadly. Please take action before this server self-destructs!  REMOVE Axgoreth!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Dismay, <BR>   I cannot agree with you more about Axegoreth, our new head GM. I have not had any personal dealings with the man, and I use the word lightly, but since he has taken over on Brell I have witnessed the near destruction of 2 of my close friends due to his inability to not only see anything remotely resembling logic or reason, but because of his total incapability to apply anything that could even be closely construed as compassion when dealing with situations that were in no way their fault and were entirely Verant's responsibility. I feel just SO secure knowing that the minute I have a problem with a situation that is out of my hands, that I have no recourse except to pray to the Gods of Norrath to help me for surely I have a better chance of providence striking than for GM Axegoreth to come up with a fair and logical solution.<BR>Dynasty<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>if that is the example then they GM was perfectly correct in not ressing you for exp. It is well known that if you die from a Dot or bleeding in duel or PvP then you will lose exp. I am surprised that another GM did res you. The fact that your friend didn't know this surprises me.. did he buy his character on EBay. Guides and GMs have policies on rez strict ones at that. IF you died get a friend to res you its your own fault.<BR>If you die to a known bug , if they witness the bug killing you or a huge router failure causing LD deaths. Since you died in a duel and got killed by a dot then you in the eyes of an intelligent GM are unfourtanly out of luck. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Bah, I wish good riddance to that GM....I was having a grand ole time tonight and decided to create a char named Abashisnerf, and had a friend create one named Eqcustomers...well, they dueled, i laughed, i logged, and came back on to here Axgoreth tell me that I am insulting a Verant employee and that i caused a serverwide disruption. WTF!?  McQuaid and Gordon themselves dubbed the term "nerf", I'm sure they wouldnt mind...in fact, Im sure that the only ones that didnt find this humorous was Axgoreth and whatever bug crawled up his ass.  Seriously, making fun of a Verant employee?  Who doesnt?  Im sure there were a ton of people who got it, but more who didn't, so I feel that I caused no harm by doing this.  And, the ones who did understand found it to be quite humorous.<BR>I guess Im just upset because I got a bad mark in my EQ record, and when I tried to understand his point of view, I get that stuck-up snotty response: "There is no room for discussion-there is nothing to talk about.  You have been warned, blah blah blah...."  And that is absolutely NOT was a GM is here for.  The guide program is dedicated to helping individuals and treating people with respect, but, hey, I guess that must be during the daytime when Zaose and Grond must be on.

On one hand he's a complete and utter idiot (Doelmite name change required because it resembles the name of an obscure movie character in an even more obscure movie, yet Gonad Master allowed), but then he does try and be responsive and there for players where he can (I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt that he just has his hands tied though some situations seem ridiculous i.e. 50th level wizard loses entire corpse in crash as he was looting it, he ended up with his SMR, Eboots and a ring I believe, Axe is all about tough nuts kiddo, g'luck in the future.

</FONT><HR>I don't know what you guys think a GM does but if you had any inclination what so ever you wouldn't be whining.  I have dealt with him before on more than one occasion and found him fare if anything.  Of course he is not going to help you if you die from a DOT spell when dueling.  Neither will any other GM on any other server.  To assume so is just ignorance.  I also read about the 'Jail' thing that happened to a couple of players.  I believe what he did was right, and in fact IS done on other servers by other GMs.  The problem is that he came online when new rules governing player actions were commited to EQ.  Do you think he makes all the rules?  LOL get real!!!!  He has a job to do just like all others and it is his resposiblity to follow through.  He may not be personable at times but he deals with a lot of crap.  So why don't you guys give him a break for god's sake.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I've only had one dealing with Axgoreth, but he was fair and by-the-book, which is honestly all you can expect from a paid Verant employee.  A person got a warning on their account during that encounter, and it was completely and utterly deserved.<P>I see a lot of people giving him flak for being inflexible, but the Verant GMs/Guides have VERY strict rules they have to go by I'm sure... Verant and/or Sony are large companies, and the GM probably doesn't have a whole lot of latitude in decision-making.  They (the companies) make the rules and the GM has to enforce them fairly and impartially to the best of his abilities.  In my one experience with him, that is precisely what Axe did.<P>Anyway, one experience does not a complete picture make, and I've *definitely* heard more negative comments than positive ones about Axe, but they mostly seem to come from a VERY vocal minority.  <P>Maybe someday when my corpse disappears and Axe says "sorry can't do nothin' for ya" to me, then maybe my opinion will change - but most of the cases of people being banned or whatever were just a result of their own stupidity or lack of foresight OR an attempt to "cheat" (swapping items out of the bank to a friend and then getting them duped when their character got restored, as an example).<P>If you haven't had any dealings with him yet, just go into it with an open mind is all I can say.  Maybe he is as bad as people say, and maybe he isn't... in my experience he did just fine.  <P>And BTW - I'm not saying that because he did anything special for me; it was a disputed camp situation and I lost fair and square when the dice betrayed me yet again, yet I hold no grudges against Axegoreth...<P>/glare dice<P>/em begins to cast a spell<BR>/em feels protected from flames</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Here's one.<P>I completed the Leatherfoot Raiders' cap quest by handing in the four requisite skins to Marshal Anrey in Rivervale.<P>Got nothing.<P>Petitioned asking if someone can check if the quest is broken.<P>Talked with several guides. Long story short, they said we'll look into it, email these people, and probably don't expect to be reimbursed, sorry. I felt bad (having spent hours on the quest) but was understanding. One guide suggested I have a guide witness the next time I finished the quest. Good plan.<P>So I finish the quest again, /petition for a witness. Axgoreth responds Sorry, that won't prove you did the quest right. (WTF??) I said I'll show you the skins I'm handing in, you can verify it yourself, and besides as the GM you have the ability to test the quest yourself to see if it works. Response: Silence.<P>"Hello?"<P>Silence.<P>"Hello?"<P>Silence.<P>"Have you gone linkdead?"<P>"I haven't gone linkdead, I've answered your question."<P>"So you're saying you won't test the quest and seeing everything I do and everything I hand in isn't sufficient to prove I'm doing the quest right?"<P>Silence.<P>I don't mind too much that he countermanded another GM and refused to witness this completion of a possibly buggy quest. What I mind is the complete arrogance of not even deigning to respond to a simple request for elaboration. That REALLY pissed me off, and what with Axgoreth arbitrarily renaming people without cause (Dolemite and Negas, for example - and I got renamed too, but in that case I had it coming) frankly Brell needs a new GM. <P>I'd transfer my char off Brell if I could.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Another concrete example or 2 of why Axgoreth needs to go.<P>The Doelmite incident has been posted before.  In essence, Axgoreth was summoned to resolve a dispute in lower Guk.  While there, he ignores the dispute and instead notices an innocent bystander named Doelmite.<P>He claims that Doelmite is "only a few letters different" from a racist clown in some B-grade arthouse flick that only film students ever see.<P>He forces Doelmite to change his name.  When he gets tells from Doelmite's guildmates and friends in protest, he starts passing out warnings for "GM Harassment".  Axgoreth was eventually overruled and Doelmite got his name back.<P>The other example happened to a Rogue I know.  I got it directly from him.  <P>The rogue was hide / sneaking through Lower Guk Liveside.  A lower-level shaman was wandering down there and thought it would be funny to get the rogue killed.<P>The Shaman threw a buff on the Rogue, which broke HIDE and had predictable results.  The Rogue heads back in naked to drag out his corpse.  The Shaman was camping the corpse and he died again.<P>The Rogue petitions and asks his guild for help.  Over the next two hours, the Shaman repeats his crimes in front of a dozen witnesses.  He gloats about his ability to get a level 40+ Rogue killed in the Logfiles of many people of solid reputation.  The Rogue dies a total of 5 or 6 times at this jerk's hand, until enough guildmates arrive to kill absolutely everything in the area.  He gets his corpse back.  The Shaman eventually leaves.<P>FOUR HOURS after the petition, Axgoreth arrives.  The rogue has lost an entire LEVEL worth of xp to this shaman.  Axgoreth refuses to even WARN the Shaman because he did not witness the events himself.<P>Purely aside from the fact that he COULD have witnessed the events were his response times not so utterly laughable, he had logfiles and a dozen witnesses.<P>So, in his most logical GM style, he threatens to ban all of the witnesses AND the Rogue if they bother him with their amassed evidence.<P>Customer Service, anyone?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum40&number=40&thisthread=000219&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum40&number=40&thisthread=000219&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
