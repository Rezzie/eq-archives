</FONT><HR>nuguk:<P>"i dunno man, seems to me like you are the one losing arguements here. nothing you said is relavant and there are holes in your arguements that i can drive a truck through"  Clever argument.  No facts, just unsubstantiated conclusions.  <P>Nothing I said is relevant?  Buzz.  Wrong answer.  What is irrelevant in what I stated?  If there's something there, then perhaps you could point it out to me.  I'm kinda slow.  And what "arguments" did I make, much less ones that had holes in them?  If they are so easy to tear apart, give it a try.  It'll make you look real l33t!   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif"><P>"seems like she did say something about increaseing armor drops for quest things. sorry phelan42, your wrong again"  Where was I wrong?  Where did I say she was only posting about nerfing, and not about the quest armour?  I'm not wrong again, for I wasn't wrong the first time.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>"also, she didnt say eq was a job she made an analogy to the working world, there is a difference"  Her analogy was flawed.  Comparing this GAME to renumeration in a JOB are inherently flawed and have been eviscerated on this board hundreds of times.  In any event, I've agreed that the quest armour ought to be less rare and more impressive.<P>"anyone who puts in a lot less time and kills easier MOBs gets less rewards than someone who kills harder stuff, that is the way it used to be an that's is how it should be"  I agree with this statement.  The quest armour is tougher, and ought to be better.  The Risk v. Reward is way out of alignment.  That does not support nerfing PoG, but buffing the quest stuff.<P>Sorry if you are hurt that I criticized the argument of your guildmate.  Hopefully the one who got a warning for her "Earth to idiot" comment.  She makes you look guys look bad, which would appear contrary to Furor's recent PR efforts.  You aren't helping either.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Please lay off the flames. I do not care if they up the drop rates of the Plane of Growth armors by 800%. I still would not CAMP there for my armor. I do not care if they decreased the drop rates by 1200%, I still would NOT camp there for my armor. The reason PoG was brought up at all was to create a baseline for comparison and to point out flaws in the armor aquisition system in Velious (See Paladins, Rangers, Druids to see the main flaw). <P>Other than using Plane of Growth as a comparison to similar armors at disimilar rates of aquisition, I really don't care what happens to the zone. FARM it all you want, my point is clear and concise and if you took the time to read it carefully, you would probably agree with what I am saying.

</FONT><HR>I agree that the quest armor needs to be re-evaluated.  Either the drop rate on the pieces needs to be raised significantly, or the armor itself needs to be improved dramatically.<P>What I don't agree with is the raw stupidity of the responses to this post:<P>1) Furor is a RANGER, Thogg - Farming PoG would be pretty tough for him. <P>2) The drop rate in the Plane of Growth DOES NOT MATTER for the quest armor, people.  It's NO DROP, for one thing, so it won't flood the economy. For another, it's not like it matters one bit if everyone on the whole server has it, including their twinks!  Guess what, your set is still valuable armor FOR YOU.  Aw, too bad, you're not l33t and unique.  If you're basing your life's value around some rare armor in a VIDEO GAME then you need serious counseling.  <P>And for the record, I've never set foot in the Plane of Growth, nor do I plan to -- I like being able to use Greater Faymart for my banking and shopping needs. Not to mention how convenient it for binding on my way to Kedge.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Although this is a good post, nothing will ever happen, I fear.  There are 2 main problems here, but if past history is any indication, nothing will change:<P>1.) Rangers, Druids and Paladins are wholly and totally screwed, especially the non-Tunare worshipping ones, EVEN IF the PoM quests for armor are found to be very easy because of what has to be gone through to even GET to the PoM.<P>2.) The Choice to befriend Dragons will soon be dropped by even the most diehard of us who have chosen this path because there is no Risk-Vs-Reward Equity in doing so.<P>Again, looking at past history... When we were Level 50, the difference between Hate and Fear was and still is, night and day.  Hate is 10s of times easier than Fear, yet nothing was ever changed in this regard.<P>On the subject of there being absolutely no reason to befriend Dragons... I can only hope that they change the quest armors, drop rates, incentives to befriend some of these races, etc., etc., to bring the game back into a state of equity.  It shouldn't be so easy for us to choose, and the mere fact that all Race-Alignments have neat High Level Areas to hunt would be something that could keep High Level Raid Crowding down by having a few guilds on each server choose different faction paths just to be the hell out of each other's way.... Instead, it appears that every single guild will choose to kill Dragons because there is no incentive not too for the rewards you can get.<P>I sometimes wonder whether they tested any of this beforehand, and as I said, I am very wary about mentioning that it is so obvious that even a monkey could see it and change it, because we have the example of Fear versus Hate that was with us from before from the Verant Design Team.<P>I just hope someone wakes up and makes this game so that the clear class and faction path choices aren't so clear in the future.  Theres no semblance of equity, whether it be on the class front or the faction choice front in Velious.  Please fix this Verant, it is really not very fun currently.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>nuguk:  Oooo, man, you got me.  I missed the one short sentence where she said anything about the quest armour.  Oops, my bad.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif">  I ranted to you?  English is your second language, right?  That's hardly a rant.  I made a statement.  And if you had to "do some research" in finding my error, this error couldn't have been that which you were referring.  Clearly, you were just talking out of your ass.<P>So, you've found one minor error I made in overlooking one sentence in three long calls for nerfs.  Where's the arguments you could drive a truck through?  Where's the irrelevant statements?  Where's any point raised between Millie and I that I "lost"?  <P>You claim you'll "do it again [prove me wrong]", yet this is the only time you've demonstrated an error.  You can't "do it again" if you haven't done it in the first place.  It's error to state that I'm contradicting myself "again" when you haven't demonstrated I had contradicted myself previously.  Logic and English do not appear to be highly in use by you.<P>So just 'cause nerfing is easier, that's what ought to be done?  Frankly, I don't mind things being a little tougher than that.  A few more plusses on the quest armour and increased drops will hardly be unbalancing.  It is for these reasons that I agree with Furor.<P>I'm not your buddy.  Based upon your inability to use proper grammar, capitalization and that idiotic "k thx bye" crap, you appear to be another lost youth.  I guess you'll be back in school tomorrow and we won't have to hear more of you foolishness.<P>If your only purpose here is to make me look like an idiot, not only have you failed, but in a most dramatic fashion.  In fact, you've done exactly the opposite.<P>If you are such a big fan of Furor's, perhaps you ought to follow his request and quit the flames and the focus upon PoG.  As for assuming you were in FoH, that's not a compliment.  It's also not derogatory, but clearly neutral.  I assumed that you were supporting Millie's foolish comments because of some camaraderie and loyalty to a guildmate.  If you aren't FoH, then your attacks on me are even more ridiculous.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>So, the issue seems to be:<BR>&lt;a&gt; Those who want to worship Tunare, can't farm PoG without throwing the last vestiges of RPing out the window.<BR>&lt;b&gt; Some classes get PoG lewt armor, some dont.  Those who don't have much harder quests.<BR>&lt;c&gt; The armor in PoG is just as good as hard-to-get quest armors from the three factions in SoV.  Now, this seems to make getting the SoV quest armor a gimpquest - ie, completely pointless.<BR>&lt;d&gt; The PoG armor is not only easier to get than all Kunark and old Planar armors, it is better than most.<P>The easyness of the PoG armor seems to have no rhyme or reason.<P>And no, it isn't like the Stien of Moggok.  Maybe if there was a PoG LORE bracer, or earring - but, you can only have one stien, so you need another item for your other yand - the focus being only margianlly better yet way more difficult is not comparable.  Don't be silly.<P>The PoG armor being quite easy seems to punish the following types of players:<BR>&lt;a&gt; Those who worship Tunare, and don't feel comfortable killing her minions, out of some RP feeling.<BR>&lt;b&gt; The random classes that can't get PoG armor by killing stuff.<BR>&lt;c&gt; Those who like fighting the hardest mobs in the game, and find the idea of getting better armor off an easy zone to be reminiscant of old Nanjea.<P>How much longer before lineups form in the PoG?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;The only thing that Verant isn't thinking about is the fact that a lot of us high level gamers are not going to buy EQ2 due to Verant's constant demonstration that they are incapable of balancing Risk and Reward. They can't do it, they are either not intelligent enough and not in touch enough with their own game. Time to find a company that can.<P>Bingo, you have summed up my feelings exactly. I too will not be buying EQ2, I do not think that Verant are a capable enough company.<P>I think people in Verant knew this too. Brian Hook left "amiably" it was reported. Is it too much to summise you leave most amiably when your escaping the sinking ship.<P>I would hazard a guess that Verant are going to milk EQ for all they can and then go back to coding crap Playstation games. <P>They would be insane to think they will be able to compete with any other Online game that is graphically superior and most importantly, fun to play. Not a chore/second job that EQ becomes. <P>I wish I had the money to develop an Online game, there are so many good ideas on this message board alone. <P>Afa<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>nuguk:  Ah, the ol' "last word" trick.  I knew you'd go for that one.  Shoot, you admired Millie's version of the same lame game.  Of course, if I'd said you would, then you'd just deny it like Millie did when I cut her off from her silly "you must be a PoG farmer" argument.<P>If you hadn't demonstrated otherwise, I'd think you were almost clever.  1.  You claimed you could drive a truck through my argument.  2.  I challenge you to do so.  3.  You claim I'm someone with no life who needs to get the last word, and dare me to be mature and not do so.  Neat little set-up to avoid having to back up your own words.<P>As I said to Furor, I don't let foolishness lie.  Every time you post something foolish, I will be here to point that out.<P>"yes its easy to post erroneous information, thats why you post all the time"  More unsubstantiated flames.  Very silly.  "dont say anythin to me and lets see if youir mature enough not to sink to my level."  Of course I won't sink to your level.  I doubt I'm capable.  I also won't let you spout more silliness without pointing that out.<P>Anger?  Not hardly.  Did you previously post here under a different name?  There was someone else that used to claim everyone who argued against his posts was "angry".  Frankly, you aren't important enough to get "angry" over.  I simply enjoy debate, especially about my favorite game.  Of course, responding to you isn't exactly a challenge, but at least it is a learning experience for others in how to argue (my posts) and how not to (your posts).<P>Ahhh, the "no life" flame.  I'm surprised it took you so long to pull this one out.  It's really clever and original and well founded.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif">  [Hint:  That was sarcasm.  Learn from it.]  Actually, I'm the CEO of a multi-billion dollar company, have a beautiful wife, two gorgeous and sexy mistresses, more money than Trump and a fulfilling spiritual life.  [Hint:  More sarcasm.]<P>No life?  I posted a dozen times yesterday.  Not exactly living my life here.  I could tell you what else I did yesterday, but like my joke above, it would be meaningless.  It would be easy to say whatever I chose, and you'd never accept it if it fell outside your childish "list."<P>See ya.  Keep demonstrating your maturity.  It's amusing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>That's just crazy.  On my server, where darks and strong 4 team guilds farm PoG, keeping faction with the place is a great tactical move.  I was really looking forward to somehow attaining the Kael Quest armor and looked around almost every site and posted on almost every message board, then someone replied with a link to her.<P>I read Furor's post and nearly cried.  Why!?  Increase the drops, or make it so that the stuff drops in other places besides VT, like oh, I dunno, Icewell Keep?  That would make some sense, considering that the Coldians in there are nto only very tough, but Giants hate the Coldain as well.<P>Just please fix the stuff, increase the drop rates, make it so that the ingrediants drop elsewhere....anything!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
