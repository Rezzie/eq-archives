</FONT><HR>You can read the previous discussion here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055864.html<BR>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056034.html<BR>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056290.html<BR>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056604.html<BR>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057051.html<P>Author Topic: Necromancer Talk <BR>Absor<BR>Station Member posted 02-07-2001 10:08 AM <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>So let's talk about necromancers.<BR>As with all the other threads, I want to talk about class balance here, not about bugs or epic weapons. You may certainly present bugs and concerns about the epic weapons, but they will not be the main concern of this thread.<P>Unlike the other threads, I have a fairly good list of ideas already garnered from several other posts to start us out. It is not complete, I'm sure. But it is certainly a good place to start our discussion.<P>Also, we are not looking to make necromancers any more effective at soloing than they already are. And, well, the necromancer is a pretty powerful class as they are now. The primary issues that I see revolve around the battle with the boss monsters. But I certainly want to hear from necromancers with concerns about all levels of the game. And, once again, I have to warn you that since we will be looking closely at this class we may very well feel that something needs to have its power reduced to achieve balance.<P>Anyhow, here's what I have already.<P>Ignite Bones: Despite the coolness factor, this spell can't really be used on the big raids because it suddenly pulls the enemy out of range, and by the time you relocate your range, one warrior could conceivably have done more damage than the spell is going to do. The best solution is to make the skeleton match the monster, if we can find some way to do that. Fixing this one spell might solve a lot of concerns. If we can’t size the skeleton, then we probably should remove it and find some other cool way to make sure that the spell 'sticks' to the target to prevent chain casting and to make it more than just another DD. Note: Any change to this spell should also be made to Chill Bones (55).<P>Lifetaps: The number one request is to allow Lifetaps to land on the big monsters. If we are telling necromancers that they have a valid place at the final encounter because they can give mana to other casters, then they will need a way to regain mana. Lich and Lifetap are the way they do that now. I am not convinced that this is something that we should change. But this is the single most asked for thing by the necromancer community. Perhaps, if made in conjunction with the fixing the bug in Lich, then perhaps this could be balanced.<P>DoTs and corpse poofing: This affects everyone. Hopefully this is now much improved, but I’m not taking it off the list until I’m convinced it has been fixed.<P>Mana transfer: Again, if their ‘place’ against the boss mob is to transfer mana, then perhaps we should allow them to do it at a better rate. A 2:1 transfer rate might be enough. I'm not at all certain that this should be done in conjunction with any change to Lifetaps in those encounters, though, as a change in one makes the other far more effective and might just be too much of a change. But this could certainly be considered if we fix the bug with the Lich spells.<P>Infusion: Make infusion targetable. The necro might still see it as a 'worthless spell', but if another caster wants to sacrifice their experience for 1000 mana, they might actually cast this spell. Otherwise, those Essence Emerald’s will only be used for raising the dead.<P>Defoliation: There seem to be plenty of plants that this just doesn't work on. I fully understand how we need to limit the use of any spell that is overly efficient against any one monster type. But it might be worthwhile to evaluate the things that are not considered plants that maybe should be. I've asked the players for a list that they'd like reviewed, but I've received nothing yet.<P>Track Corpse: Broken spell. Is it going to stay that way?<P>Epic Weapon: The look and effect are not well loved in the community.<P>Lich Series: This series of spells is broken. It is more powerful than it should be. It takes the necromancer's hit points and turns them into mana. It was calculated at a certain ratio to be 'in balance'. Unfortunately, these spells were adversely affected by the reduction of damage to spells used by players on players. This change also reduced the hit points taken from the necromancer by Lich spells, so that the ratio of mana gained for hit points lost is nearly 1 for 1 (instead of about 3 for 2). This is a bug that we have chosen not to change in the past because it would be a 'nerf'. I think in conjunction with a serious look at the entire class and the balance of all the classes, we should also look at this series and decide if we should put it right. If it remains as it is, the necromancer is going to be limited in the improvements it can gain, as the class is already using a powerful and broken spell series. Note: Series includes: Arch Lich (60), Demi Lich (60), Lich (49), Call of Bones (34), Allure of Death (20).<P>Alan<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Heh, Necromancers are not the most powerful solo class. <BR>I wish, I hope, I pray that Verant/Absor would post specifics on this and post comparative <P>examples using Druids, Magicians, Shaman, Wizards, Bards and Enchanters.<P>In an honest assessment there is not ONE situation where one of these classes can’t better <P>solo a spawn than Necromancers can. Post your examples where you believe that a Necromancer <P>can solo better than these other classes. Your player base would shred that example.<P>Oh but fact goes against the undocumented Vision doesn't it?<P>So that I'm not misunderstood.<BR>At least one of the other classes mentioned can solo a spawn/npc better/more efficiently <P>than a necromancer can in specific situations. That’s the problem with generalizations. Once <P>you get specific it’s easy to point out that, <P>"No a Druid can solo that more efficiently than a necromancer can." <BR>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>There are balance issues because:<BR>1) Clerics are required.<BR>2) Warriors are required.<BR>When two classes have no relative equivalent in game there will be balance issues.<BR>3) Enchanters are required.<P>When a third class has no relative equal in game. <BR>See above.<P>4) Necromancers are not required for any task. In fact, they are often excluded. There is a <P>better substitute for any ability a necromancer offers. From Rogue and Shadow Knight for <P>corpse recover to Enchanters for mana replacement. <P>Yet the game designers in their infinite knowledge feel necromancers are too powerful and <P>require a reduction in power. <BR>Begging the question from most EQ scholars, why?<P><BR>----------------------------------------------------------------------</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Uber mobs are created to handle certain unbalancing elements in specific classes, yet this makes the mobs WAY out of reach of the other classes.  And then the class with the advantage is nerfed.

</FONT><HR>I play a necro on Quellios and even though I've only made it to 35 (oh god the hell levels get worse!) I can give a summary of what I see as good about the necro and what I can see needs some work.<P>The good part is that I can find something to kill by myself waiting for a group that will give me some xp or some cash.  The bad part is that I find myself waiting a lot longer than I do as an enchanter, druid, shaman, monk, warrior, or shadow knight all of which I have played to a similar level.<P>Another good part, I always have a hunting partner that's willing to die for me.  Good ole Jabober.  The bad part is that he gets more fragile the older I get.  I don't really need or want him to do more damage but I'd like for him to be able to taunt better and for him to be able to take a bit more punishment.  I do have some serious issues with his resistances though.  I think that when a spell is cast on him it should check my resistances instead of his.  I am the one who summoned him and tells him what to do right?  Should I be able to give him some pointers on what to do when someone wants to kill him.  I'm not sure of the fear immunity but if he just checked off of my resistances I could get some gear that is appropriate to what I'm fighting.<P>I think that when you consider the balance issues you need to ask some questions.  For example in a group you might hear "Hey, we need an enchanter for the crowd control tonight" or "We need a shaman for the tank buffs and their debuffs." or "It would be sweet to get a druid for their SoW and tracking.  We'll never get the a_rare_wandering_spawn without them."  I'd like to have someone say "Hey, we need that necro in our group to make it complete."<P>The problem is we don't have the skills that we need to have in a group.<P>Wizards, Druids, Mages, and Enchanters Nuke better.<P>Enchanters are irreplacable indoors for crowd control and outdoors a druid is a very close second with harmony.<P>Healing, don't even go here.  I can bandage faster than I can heal as a necro.  Clerics, Shaman, and Druid.  Those are the only people that can really heal.<P>Snaring the mob?  Well Darkness is pretty cool but it's not something that you'll cast in a dungeon.  It's all about killing them fast and stopping the runners.  Root and all it's variants rule here.  We don't get root till 34 and then an upgrade at 49.<P>Buffs? We've got DMF and Spirit Armor (which you have admited we probably shouldn't have).  I don't have to list the other classes buffs you know that we are the worst buffers out there.<P>I'm not saying I want to be a buffer or a healer.  I'd be a different class if that's what I wanted.  What I do want is to be wanted in groups and do massive ammounts of damage.  If I do damage with my pet, fine.  If I slow the creature down so it doesn't attack so fast, fine.  If I take his armor class down so tanks can finish him off 20% faster (that's what I should add in a group).  If I can do 20% of the damage by nuking him down, fine.<P>One last point.  I as a necro would never give away the power (mana) that I have gained in making the deals with the devil in order to give it away to some goody goody cleric or tree hugging druid.  I'll tell you what you make me valuable in a group by killing things and you can have all my mana transfer spells.  Heck, I might even give up Spirit Armor for some group benefits in my 30's and 40's.<P>All I'm saying is that when I hear "35 Necro LFG" my group says "Hey we need him for ....."

</FONT><HR>Ok the anticipation is growing, today is Thursday and there is a patch tomorrow so I know Absor is going to post the change that they are putting up on Test with the patch. I cant wait, its gonna be either later tonight or tomorrow just as he promised, I know it is. I am going to check back every half hour cause I know Absor is going to spawn.<P>So as it looks from the posts, many that I agree with, we are the 3rd best class at soloing now even though we give up our group desireability so we can solo so well?!?<P>We cant harm an Uber mob (I heard a rumor that Ignite Bones stuck to Woushi once) and we now share the Summon Corpse with Shadow Knights.<P>We can feed mana to another class but if thats suppose to be our role (which no sane necro wants) we suck at it.<P>The standard answer from a raid leader when inquiring about a spot on their raid is, "We already have ONE necro, we dont need anymore"<P>With our horrible faction comes incredible power?<P>I am anxious to see what ideas Absor comes up with. I want to see necros more desirable in groups or I want to see 4 more zones added that are prime necro soloing territory. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I remember a time when a naggy raid depended mostly on how many necros you could find to lifetap it. I don't want to go back to those days, although it would be fun for my 50 necro. We are the most powerful solo class, without doubt. at 49 it takes me about 2 hours per bubble soloing, and there is no real danger. <BR>I don't want us to become wizards when it comes time to fight the uber mobs, even if our lifetaps don't have nearly the ratio of ice comet.. Add to that vi's thinking that nerfing lich will balance would only make things worse. <BR>Lich sucks hp like a mad dog. I know this has been said a number of times, and i won't repeat ad naseum what poor alan has already read a ton. It's already a very dangerous spell to use, and the risk equals the reward. no necro should use clarity of c2 if they can get a regen today. but if lich does 50% more damage, it will swing the other way. <BR>I really feel the majority of necros would be happy (not counting the epic) if 2 changes were made: <P>1. make ignite bones series usable/not cufusing/etc while still keeping the recast limit. <BR>2. make lifetap dot's land on everything. It does a paltry amount of damage relative to an ubermob's hp, but will allow us to fill our secondary role the way we should. <P>If lich changes are made, it will increase downtime by 50% for the soloing necro, make us much less efficient, and will force me to play my bard. especially considering the fact that there is only one regen item in the game that i can use, and i'm never going to see it.. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I pull with dark, dot/pet etc. sit and med with lich and bond of death on. by the time the fight is over, i have about 15 seconds of bond of death left, full hp and 3 bubs of mana. I'm ready to go again in less than 30 seconds, and yes, i always do more damage than my pet, and never take off lich. <BR>it takes me less than 2 hours per bubble, faster since i got 49 spells. <BR>In fact, the xp is so fast and easy I had myself sacrificed 12 times to stock up.. hehe<P>I would like to be able to damage uber mobs, but lifetaps don't do that much damage to begin with, and i don't want to sacrifice my great soloing ability for 1% of my eq life.. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just had another quick thought this time with regard to pets.  At low levels pets are pretty handy to have and thats what makes soloing very practical until about level 25.  Beyond that they are almost useless in a solo situation because they deal so little damage and also take so little.<P>For example at level 40 I now have my level 39 pet spell.  If I'm lucky I summon up a pet which cons blue and not green.  Now I con various mobs around me in the Overthere - lets say a Sarnak Knight which cons blue.  Now if I were fighting another PC which conned blue I would expect the odds to be pretty even - likewise if a warrior were to solo the knight he would be pretty confident of winning.<P>However, I stick my blue conning pet onto this Knight and whereas my pet hits for 33 if I'm lucky, the Sarnak hits regularly up to 80.  Even with my pet buffing spell the pet last very little time on his own - maybe 30 seconds before he bites the dust and the angry Sarnaks heads for me.  My pet will be very lucky if he has knocked 25% of the health of the Sarnak off.<P>The only way for my pet to win is to make sure that at all times the mob is darked and feared.  If either of these don't stick then I start getting into trouble - and a lot of the time they don't - hence why it seems more sensible at higher levels to group.<P>My point in all of this is that the either the pet or the Sarnak is a major mis-conn.  I know the Sarnak does not con wrong as a similar level tank to me could solo him (admittedly he would need to rest afterwards).  So this means that my pet (which cons blue) is seriously underpowered for something of that level.<P>This makes me think that Verant have nerfed our pets so much they tank about 10 levels lower than they con once you start getting to level 29 pets.<P>How on earth can we be called the kings of soloing when we are so reliant on fear kiting using our pets and our pets are so useless.  Not to mention of course that the fear kite tactic is useless in any dungeon.  You would think that necros being the dark, evil beings that they are would be good in dungeons but in fact they can only perform a decent role outside.<P>This is a similar situation to druids except they're *meant* to be good in outside environments and they can solo so much better than us anyways.<P>But of course we are so overpowered you'd better nerf our pet some more.  Oh, and that 10 minutes we have to sit and wait to recover even with the help of lich - thats far too short, so you'd better go ahead and nerf that too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Change the spell/skill/epic name and they are all basically saying the same thing. Now, I am by no means saying that none of it is valid. Amazingly enough, most of it seems to be remarkably valid, on-topic, and mostly flame free. If I were Absor, and I knew the high level of abuse I will get when I post a response, I think I would wait until the last second to respond also. Then duck (pun intended) and run. <P>It seems to me that no-one has anything new/different to add. Hell, some people are just cut & pasting other peoples posts.<P>If you really want to get some worth while attention, make this class discussion different than the others. Make it better. Post what works in the post 50 necro game. What you like, what Verant should do more of. Show Verant that the necromancer community can adjust their point-of-view to get out of a mind-set that is hindering open communication. Verant has shown that they can do so with the enhancements to experience, especially for hybrids. Not all that long ago, the company line was the experience system is set and not subject to change. If we encourage this behavior with positive feedback, perhaps it will be repeated.<P>Absor: Several posts claim that you said you would respond to this discussion, this week. Even if that is true, forget about it. Please take your time. Look into the issues thoroughly. If you don't already do so as a player, see if you can watch an uber-mob-raid (as an invis/ghost guide) with a necromancer in it. The whiners are pushing for a post. They seem to want "I'm sorry I haven't posted sooner. I'm still reading the various threads and gathering data. I will respond to the major concerns as soon as I am able." I'd rather wait for a response with value.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Necros want a reply because we're concerned that nobody give a damn about the problems most necros see in the class.  I for one would like at least the lip-service that is being afforded other classes.  I'll add also that if one checks out other class discussions then yes, you do see complaints, but you don't see discussions focused on the fact that they are absolutely useless to a group post-50.  Tanks still tank, Rogues still backstab, Healers still heal, Shamans & Druids still heal/buff, Wizards still nuke, Mages still have useful pets, and Enchanters still boost mana/provide crowd control/buff.  Necros do what?  Give all their mana away one time?  Where are the DoT's?  Where's my supposedly awesome pet?  They've all been traded away so I can perform a duty that was recently foisted on us.  And, because 1/3 of the spells we need to perform the duty that most of us apparently didn't want in the first place won't land on Boss Mobs (the health transfer spells) we can't even perform that task in a useful manner.<P>I began playing a necro not to be the most powerful or best solo-ing class but because I wanted to be the Avatar of slow, wracking, virulent, festering, painful suffering!

</FONT><HR>Erebus-<BR>DoTs are not used in "boss" MoBs because of a bug that may/or may not have been fixed. How it works:<BR>- Caster (any, not just necros) casts DoT.<BR>- If caster is LD or charmed, and at same time MoB dies from DoT...<BR>= MoB corpse kiled by an "NPC" (as server sees it), so no corpse. Poof, no loot. ANGRY raidmembers.<P>Verant said they have fixed this, but if you were the raid leader, would you take that chance? Add to it that GMs will not do anything to help when it happens. So, no DoTs in a raid.<P>The other reason is that the time it takes DoTs to do their damage is greater than the time it takes 'big' MoBs to kill everyone.<P>DoTs ROCK for solo/kiting, but are lousy for short, group fights.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>/agree mousetrap<P>Yes.  Not only do I agree fully with Mousetrap, but ya know what?  I want a reply becuase I'm contributing to his paycheck.  I'm paying for a product, an investment which I have put a lot of time and effort into... And now this investment stands to be changed for the WORSE.<BR>Perhaps some of you can lay down and go with it without speaking up.  I, on the otherhand, want a reply (as promised).  I want to know that the MAJORITY has been heard and the MAJORITY does NOT want LICH NERFED.<BR>Frankly, I have played my necro from lvl 1 to mid 50.  As far as the enhancement goes, I don't care what they do as long as they spread it out over the WHOLE class and not just 50+ because it isn't just about 50+, it's about all of us.<P>I don't see what's so difficult about just enhancing our class (like their doing with every other class) without the consistent threat of downgrading some portion of our class.  Our class isn't near as powerful as it once was and now other classes (I'll leave examples out becuase we already know who they are) can solo more efficiently than we can.  I'd love to quad kite 4 raptors or spiroks or sea furys or &lt;fill in blank&gt;...But ya know what I can only do 1 at at time, and it doesn't matter, that's great for them.  Just be fair to me, that's all I ask and all I pay for.<P>So, am I entitled to a reply that was promised?  Yes, I am.<P>There have been a lot of great expressions of what fellow necromancers would like to see in the way of class enhancements that would definately fit the bill without being unreasonable.  I think we all deserve a reply.. again, as promised.<P>Thank you very much.<BR>Drakious Vuduchile<P>Ps..I saw this:<BR>"You obviously have never used the spell. the mana regen on it is simply *insane*, even while standing."<BR>I am very familiar with this spell and would also like to point out that the loss of HP is simply *insane*, especially while standing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>VI,<P>I was going to flame you for not responding to the pages, upon pages of intelligent, well thought out posts.<P>I have decide otherwise.  I believe I have figured out the problem and I am sad for you.  Ignorance, and prejudice is always sad.<P>You think prejudice is a word that doesn't apply here?  Think again.  <P>Prejudice<BR>1. An adverse judgment or opinion formed beforehand or without knowledge or examination of the facts. <BR>2. A preconceived preference or idea. <BR>3. The act or state of holding unreasonable preconceived judgments or convictions. <BR>4. Irrational suspicion or hatred of a particular group, race, or religion.<P>Definition 1. describes the problem, as many have already put forth.  Necro's are condemed due to judgements made before examining the facts and without knowledge of those facts.<P>The rest of these definitions reinforce this as being the correct word for this situation.<P>Verant, the only way to overcome prejuidice is through education, thus overcoming ignorance in the same process.  Educate yourselves.  Don't give me that "We know this game, who do you think developed it" line.  It won't fly.  I work for a Company that develops Software.  The software we develop is used by real soldiers and is designed for real battles.  I manage the System Engineering team, and assist with software design, as well as implementation and field support.  The idea that I knew more about that software, just because I wrote it went out the window after my second deployment.  Users will ALWAYS find things you didn't know were there, will always be able to show you bugs you thought were fixed, and will always be able to describe how the software does or does not perform in real life better than any year long component/integration/system level testing cycle ever could.  So please don't even go there.  <P>I ask you to listen to your user base.  Listen to the real experts, those that play these classes, and act on thier suggestions.  If you ever want to deliver a completely balanced product you will have to overcome these prejudices you developed during the early days of EQ and learn what, in the case of this thread, Necromancers are TODAY.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It needs a new effect, such as a use 2-5 times daily res, we are the masters of death, as such we should be able to make them come back from the dead too, make it castable on PC's as well as NPC's on PC's when we cast it we lose 1000 hp and get the res effect, on npcs they become our pets<BR>but it needs a limit, because ressing people or npc's should tax us very hard, so make a limit on how many resses we can do a day, such as 5 or less. Also with a limit on the resses we wouldn't be in competition with the clerics, it would be an emergency use thing. or a group conjure corpse<BR>ok now on to other items that we could use<BR>1. we need a group DMF , it gets so boring DMFing 40 people<BR>2. a group conjure corpse wouldn't be bad actually that would rock still takes tiny coffins but would sure be more benefitial.<BR>3.

</FONT><HR>     I went to my mailbox last night, and I found this month's issue of Computer Games waiting there for me.  I'm flipping through it in class today, and I find an article on Everquest: The Scars of Velious.  This magaziine always includes screenshots with comments by the author of the article, and naturaly this was also the case with this EQ expansion.  Typically they are the usual blah blah about how nice the graphics are, or how fun it is to do this or that.  THIS is what was writen in regards to this game:<P>"The Necro's eventually glamorous role - mana dumping on clerics so they can heal the monks kicking Whatshisface to death."  --Computer Games #124<P>     This reference was specific to the Necro, i.e. no other class in the game was singled out for such ridicule.  So what does this tell you Verant?  The Necro class is broken post 50.  It is NOT just us players that are saying so.  We are SO broken, that it was worth pointing out as a source of amusement in this magazine.<P>     I want to play the Necro the vision originally had in mind.  Namely, the Necro from fantasy literature that people fear because he has mastered magic so dark and powerful that other spellcasters fear to use it.  I do not want to play some character that at the pinacle of his art, is no more powerful than he was 10 levels earlier, and has no function other to to give his mana away at a pathetic exchange rate to someone who can put it to better use.  Why would the original spellcasters who invented magic even have bothered to pursue the art of necromancy if THIS was all there was at the end of the road?  Why would other casters shun the use of necromantic magic if THIS is all they had to fear from the practicioners of it?<P>     Verant, I'm begging you, make the Necro what it should be (and if you don't know what the Necro should be, then by all means read any, and I do mean ANY, fantasy literature about Necromancers).  The post 50 Necromancer class in EQ is nothing like ANY Necromancer from any source I have read anywhere.  I'm convinced the gist of The Vision is to make classes that 1)resemble recognizable classes from popular fantasy literature/games/ect. and 2)incorporates these classes into EQ in such a way that they would be desireable to play by a fair number of people.  The post 50 Necromancer class fails on both of these goals.<P>     If your main concern right now is 'fixing' Lich, your goals for repairing the Necromancer class are SO far off that I see little hope of this class ever being what it should be.  I'm looking forward to the day when I open a Computer Games magazine and see articles about how much fun it is to play ANY of the classes in EQ that it's really hard to decide which one to pick.  I do not want to see more articles laughing at what a joke my favorite class has become.  I hope the kind folks at Verant would want this too.  Until then, thanks for listening.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I won't say again what ppl said along all these threads. I love the Target FD idea as the others do. I admit (I think no body can say the opposite) that our pets lack power and are very hard to get (more than one month to get the lvl 56 one, such a shame !). We are really poor on group and raid capability (we aren't the only class in that case, but I really think we are in the worst situation). I don't want to see my mindless and lifeless pet flee in despair while a nature living one doesn't (there is no logic at al in that). I don't want to see the Lich line nerfed (do you realise that Necros are BEGGING you to not Nerf it while we post to get enhancement ? don't you think you are going a little too far ?)...at least, if you Nerf it, allow us to stack Clarity line with Lich line. <BR>our Epic weapon is simply the worst in the whole game...we can argue the whole night about reasons to get something helpfull...but I won't (who said you already done it ?)<P>The real fact you have to admit is that almost ALL Necros (at least high levels) are telling exactly the same thing. It doesn4t look like other threads where ppl are begging for enhancement (that they surely need, I am not here to tell something else) but only Necros speak with the same voice on the same problems. There is no soloing issue in targetable spells we already have for ourselves, it is just a nice opportunity to find a group (I really think that Target FD is the best idea so far, maybe need to be discussed on the best way to implement it and the lvl to reach to do so, but a really good idea...). Some other ideas are great but I don4t want to be more powerfull than I am...I am a Master of the Death (and the deads in fact) but Death isn't greedy, Death have time to strike...I don't need to kill mobs faster...I will wait for them to die slowly...but I want to prevent my group from what I am living for...they serve me in my schemes, I need them alive !<P>All Necros want is a chance, so tiny can it be, to find a group...you build a game in which you force ppl to group and you don't give us any use in group, what is the plain exactly ? Should Necro pay for ability to snare and fear a mob (which is only usefull BEFORE lvl 51 or in rare zones like SkyFire) ? Is the ability to Feign Death enought to find a group ? Do you really think a whole raid will manage your inefficiency just to gain 600 or 700 mana (despite the fact they must keep us alive and the time it takes to do so !) before we went oom ? Are you aware that we don't have to be in a group nor raid to summon corpses, just to come after the disaster ? <P>Please, at lest, tell us something...it is the Sixth thread dealing with it and still no (or almost) clue about what is about to happen to us (hum...we aren't alone, I know).<P>To resume : stop giving our powers to others while nerfing us, you really will kill Necro class...please, read YOUR OWN description of the class and wonder yourself if you are in the right way...<P><BR>PS : say something...............</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Yeah i agree stop giving our powers to other while nerfing  Necros. Example,...Wizzy get invi to Undead now (weird), Sk get summon corpse, Sk got  Improved Feign Death ?? while Necros dont ? (Necros in roleplay wise, should get Imrpoved feign death spell than SK), Mages got Ubber pet (epic), Fearless pet,while they already have those high resist fire,cold etc etc according to type of pet. Necro pet has very very low HP, 1000 hp for 53 pet ? gees pass lvl 50  mob hits like 100++  less than 7 hit it will be dead. Necro over power ?
