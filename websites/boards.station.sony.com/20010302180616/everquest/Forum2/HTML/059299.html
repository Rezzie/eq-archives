Chat rooms were flooded with people complaining about getting disconnected.  And when I log in and find out I'm dead, I'm told "NO REZ FOR YOU!" because it's not a verifiable bug.  Are you kidding me?!!  You're going to try to tell me my ISP is the one causing this as well as the thousands of other people out there?  That's BS!

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;. I am one of the THOUSANDS that got disconnected last night. <P>There wasn't any network hit last night that caused a measureable number (about 1000) people to drop last night.  Constant flux is about 500 people logging in or out at any given time, raising to about 750-1000 during peak hours.  In any case, check out my posts at http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058962.html<P>I try to explain some facets of internet connectivity in online gaming there.  The short of it is that disconnects happen.  They will always happen.  There is no hardware nor software on the internet that is perfect, including yours and ours.  We try to make the best of cases where we know our network or our direct upstream provider is at fault, but our customer service department can't be responsible for every disconnect out there.<P>-Gordon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Abashi,no offense but the original post was not about getting a lesson in internet connectivity. If the flux of people logging in and out is as high as you say then so be it. But when people log out of the game they dont go to the chat room and complain about "Hey I just logged out of the game" On the night in question there was a large spike of some sort where there were a lot  disconnected. The Innoruuk server got a large hit. There were MANY people in the chat complaining about it. I too died due to it while in the middle of kiting 3 orcs in Eastern Wastes. When I was able to get logged back I was dead. I had lost about a bubble of XP. I don't bother petitioning anymore because I either get the "I can't help you" reply or by the time I get a response I will have probably got the XP back anyway.<P>One small suggestion. Sack the GMs and guides, they cant or wont do anything anyway, then reduce our monthly fee from the savings you make.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Abashi,<P>I'm sorry, but I can not accept your explanation in this case.  Yes, individually, disconnects happen.  However, when disconnects happen to hundreds of players within about 1 min of each other, I have a hard time chalking it up to coincidence.<P>Was it also coincidence that immediately upon re-logging, we received a GM broadcast announcing that the Bertoluxxus (oh, I know I murdered the spelling on that) server was now back up?  Seems to me that this pretty clearly points to some kind of connection between bringing that server up and the disconnects.  <P>With this sort of clue, I find it disappointing that this is not even being CONSIDERED as the cause of the problem.  <P>Come one, Verant, you can do better than this.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>All I know is this:<P>I started playing EQ on the Test Server at the start of January using my modem.  My pings were great (&lt; 400), never experienced packet loss and I never once went Link Dead.<P>In a nutshell, gameplay was perfect.<P>One day, (I think it was Feb 4th) there was a huge patch and EVERSINCE then I have suddenly gotten tons of packet-loss and disconnects.  <P>Not just "every so often", either.  Every single day.  Guaranteed.  If I play for a 4 hour period (regardless of the time of day), I guarantee you that I go get disconnected at least once.<P>When I am actually able to play the game, my pings now fluctuate between 300 and 2000 which makes playing the game annoying.<P>And it seems like a wide variety of people in the US are also having this same problem.<P>It's ridiculous that Verant is trying to blame ISPs.  How can systems go from perfect performance one day to horrid performance the next?<P>I know people who use DSL, Cable and Modems and are in different locations in the US and they are ALL experiencing this problem with EQ since Feb 4th.<P>Why can't Verant just accept the blame for whatever they did to the server that day (Feb 4th) that has screwed everything up?<P>Better yet, with all these people suddenly reporting problems, why don't they try to fix it?<P>Accept it.  You broke something.  Now please fix it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Poopsmcgee, the same thing happened to me.  I made a last minute decision to grab a port to Iceclad because I wanted to check out the vendors in Thurgadin and see if anyone sold any nifty trinkets while I was away.  So I pay for the port, and the druid SoW's me.  I head out and zone into Eastern Wastes.  I am invisible and running at SoW speed across the zone with no mobs on me.  Halfway across the zone between the Ry`Gorr Fort and the Frost Giant Fort, I go LD along with many others.  I log back on and I am dead and in East Cabilis.  When my petition is answered I am told that I will not receive a rez due to lag death.  Oh well, all I can say is suck it up and start leveling again.... *shrug*<P>Predatorus Viktus<BR>"The Father," First Order of Blood Knights<BR>Shadow Division, Shadow Centauri<BR>46th Scale Shadow Knight<BR>Bristlebane Server<P>"There is an ancient Iksar saying, that something lasts only as long as the last person remembers it.

</FONT><HR>Ok Abashi, so please explain to me why in Hate lastnight (The Rathe, and that alone probably answers my own question) we had over 65% of everyone in the zone go LD and drop to server selection more than on four occasions?? Everytime it happened they ALL went LD at once. Don't tell me that is each and every one of their ISPs doing it. They were from different parts of the country/world using different ISPs. Verant had some SERIOUS problems lastnight(everynight?)keeping The Rathe even up, let alone staying connected to the thing. And guess what? We all asked across multiple guild channels and you want to know what was said? "Just happened here also" ("here" being the zone they were in) Go figure! <P>But your right in saying that you guys are not responsible for all the disconnects, but just remember: neither are we. So try having the GMs understand that as well. But when hundreds of players drop *at the sametime* from a server it is reason enough to raise an eyebrow in thinking *maybe* it is the server you play on (yes "hundreds" is a very safe estimate considering I was watching the numbers on EverMon from my laptop while playing).<P>Pose another question for ya:<BR>Why are there so many LD issues when zoning? Take a poll, ask your players:<BR>"If you go LD, when does it most likely occur"<BR>a.) While zoning<BR>b.) Around a high number of players<BR>c.) Randomly<BR>d.) Only while casting spells<BR>e.) Only when fighting<BR>f.) I never do LD<BR>g.) All of the above (I play on The Rathe)<P>Ok so g.) was a personal one, but seriously ask the playerbase. Let's see how much of a real issue zoing and going LD is. I know Verant claims to have found/fixed yet another issue that was causing LD problems while zoning, but I honestly believe there are more.<P>-Rev</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm not sure about last night, but yesterday afternoon approximately half of the servers became unavailable to all of the players on them, myself being one of them.  The GMs online at the time said that there would be exp rezzes, as the problem was traced to the CerfNet routers that service EQ going down.  They were down for at least an hour, then all the servers got taken down for the emergency patch.  This happened at approximately 3:30-4:00 pm EST.  If poopsmcgee is talking about the same incident, he should have gotten an exp res, according to the gms in the 27 chat channels at the time.

They are not part of your ISP network, nor part of Verants provider.<P>If one of these machines chokes, traffic and links may get slowed down or stopped completely. But your link is rerouted shortly. Thus, you can re-establish your link and continue.<P>Unfortunately, Verant can't do anything about this. I'm not saying it doesn't suck, but thats the way the internet works, people.<P>If you don't like the way the current technology works, design a better system.

When you go into a movie theatre and pay your money to see the flick, and half way through the screen starts to get augmented and you miss maybe 10-15 minutes of the movie, the movie theatre doesn't tell you that it must have been the irregular dialation of you pupil that caused the problem.  They will give you a movie voucher, or refund your money, or do SOMETHING to make it up to you.  Now, I realize that you have made alot of money off of us that pay you constantly every month to play this MRPG.
