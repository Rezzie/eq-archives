</FONT><HR>Since this is getting into a camping thread, aka some people think that everyone who honors list systems is a "camping lamer" or something of that nature I have a couple of more comments.<P>I am predominately a casual player, 2-3 hours at a time is my typical hours. I have ALWAYS honored camp lists, ALWAYS. Due to my short hours I might not be decked out in planar gear but I have almost every pre-kunark coveted item on my warrior and done in casual hours. The higher level status quo honors lists, ALWAYS. I know that if I go into a named mob spot with a group and DEMAND the next spawn due to PnP that my name will be known by most of the higher level raiders in a matter of days if not hours or minutes.<P>My server has almost always been VERY open about letting "pick-up" members in on raids. If there is one thing I know it is that reputation means a lot on my server, have a bad one and you might as well forget ever doing fire giants, a dragon, a phinny, or planar raid. It just won't happen by evoking PnP through the course of your existance. I have been on pickup raids (even if for a few hours) into almost every high level spot in the game. (All of them before Kuanrk) That is because I protected my reputation as best I could and avoided at all costs calling for a GM or guide to settle differences.<P>My tactic is to play a lower level character after I have gotten on a list and let the list holder know my 2nd's name. Most don't mind at all and are glad to do it. Sometimes I never come up, sometimes I do. And I get lucky from time to time and have gotten those Yaks, BEBP's, common drops, FBSS, etc in casual player hours. And I use my reputation to keep in touch with other guilds on their planned raids so I might be able to come along for that one session every once in a while that I can stay longer than 2-3 hours.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>"How do I have equal access if I'm told to wait on a list until someone decides they are done fighting."<P>KidF: EQUAL access. Everyone who waits on the list for their turn DOES have equal access to a spawn. Equal. Equal doesn't mean "right now," equal means "everybody has to endure the same method of gaining access to a spawn." Equal can mean being put into the rotation immediately, equal can mean being put on a list, it can also mean being in one of two groups who are taking turns at a particular spawn site. <P>I think most people on the board have shown that they understand what "sharing" means. You seem to have a short circuit when it comes to getting that concept. Sharing means letting other people have access.<P>If I'm going to share a pair of scissors so each of 4 kids can cut squares (let's say I'm a kindegartener &lt;grin&gt; ), it would be silly for four kids to take one cut (one side of the square) each and then pass them down the line. It's much more efficient for each kid to cut out the whole square then pass the scissors to the next kid. No kid is left out of using the scissors in this sort of sequential sharing. <P>It's just that one of the kids (like people who really love to invoke the PnP) starts getting all antsy and hyperactive and ADD and decides, "Forget this! I want the scissors now!" So he goes and gets the teacher and complains that Johnny isn't letting him have the scissors. Well, when the teacher hears this, she'll assume that Johnny is being a jerk because he hasn't given the brat the scissors yet. And even if Johnny protests, "But I was going to let him have the scissors when I was done with them!" the teacher (analogous to a GM, of course) will inevitably decide to make Johnny fork over the scissors right now in order to "promote sharing."<P>Sure, the other two kids who were waiting patiently for their turn at the scissors get stuck having to wait for the brat kid to throw his tantrum, call the teacher, and generally be a bleedin' nuisiance. Me, I'd just as soon plunge the scissors in the brat's eye and be done with the whole mess. But that's me.<P>KidF: You make it seem like a group who has a list will be there for hours and hours with nobody leaving to give other people a chance. That's not true, and it just doesn't happen. If you spend enough time at one of the "list" camps, you'll see that getting into the group is extremely easy. Usually there's a fluctuating group there for 24/7. That doesn't mean that the same 6 people are there for 24 hours. It means that the group looses and gains members all the time, constantly changing configuration. I've been playing the game for over a year, and I have NEVER EVER EVER seen a group maintain constant composition for more than an hour or two. Max. Someone inevitably has to go walk the dog or eat dinner or watch TV or clean the garage. Don't forget that this game is played by people all over the world. It's always somebody's bedtime. <P>You're making a mountain out of a molehill. The list system absolutely DOES satisfy the PnP. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>KidF,<P>I just had to go back and read a bit closer through your comments. <P>When I started playing this game I decided I wanted to see everything there is in the game I could see. I wanted to see the dragons, the planes after they came out, every zone in the game, etc. There is only one way to do this, level and get better gear since EQ is so equipment based. I don't care about twinking a newbie in "god" gear or bragging about all my "phat lewt". I just want to adventure and play with my friends that I have met in over a year of EQ.<P>If what I am reading into your comments is accurate, you expect to use PnP to go anywhere you choose in the game at any time and do what you want to do. This will not happen bud, not amoung any of the gamers I know. Sure you might be able to call in a GM to make someone rotate the Frenzy or whatever but I bet that 95% or more of the players in the game will hate you for it, and always remember. You talk about the game being crowded, B.S.! It is crowded MOSTLY where the items are not the exp. You can go get exp anywhere and in almost any zone at any level. I was soloing my warrior at times up at level 47. Why is the pool room so popular in Solb? No phat lewt that's for sure. It is because of the non-stop action a group of players can enjoy in the level 35-45 range. Someone might come in and pull a Kobold or take one of the spawn spots from time to time. The group there might grumble about it but eventually just work around it. Do that in the King room where a level 45 group is trying to get a RMB or whatever and you will be chastised by the players severely and rightfully so.<P>People that honor lists know full well who those that use PnP to get their way are in item dropping spots most of the time. Most of these PnP evokers at the upper levels are Ebayers and well known and often brag about how much money they make, at least on my server. But you NEVER see them in South Ro forming in a hate raid or in the Ferrott going to fear. Mention that one of them is online and is available for that dragon run, people will start spamming the zone with their exploits of forcing their way into places using PnP and many will threaten to leave the raid. <P>PnP is like Prohibition was in the U.S. A grand idea that just won't work because it is inherently flawed. Yes Abashi specifically mentioned certain servers where guilds were monopolizing spawns 24/7 for weeks on end.<P>"The Play Nice Policies were created because a growing number of customers were being subordinated by other, more powerful, groups of players. These other groups would claim "ownership" of spawns, loot drops, and even entire zones, refusing to allow other people a chance to experience them. On some servers, guilds had certain areas camped 24x7." <P>That is in this thread bud.<P>Now here you are.<P>"I don't read anything in his posts that says the Pnp was implemented was created because people were locked out of a spawn indefinitely."<P>Well read it again! PnP was a game wide rule that overwrote player made ettiquette because of problems on a few servers. Most of us in the upper levels hated it when it came out and still hate it because of its ease of abuse, yes ABUSE. Yes, lists could be abused but on most of the servers most of the time they worked and worked well.<P>Has PnP stopped uber guilds on some servers from camping all three planes, the efreeti, scooping up the dragon loot, the fire giants, or anything they wish ALL AT THE SAME TIME? NO! The same problem stills exists on the servers where it was the worst on before PnP. There is a whole world of stuff out there for exp all over the place but shoving a rule down someone's throat is total BS and will make you one of your server's most wanted eventually. It promotes fighting, hatred, etc. All the better servers I know of where players work together and help one another keep in touch with other guilds and raiders and work out scheduling and other issues without some spoonfed rule from VI after the fact.<P>All of this just makes me wonder what the game will be like in another year. Will we be seeing PnP and other rules being shoved down people's throats that know what the cooperation, scheduling, list holding systems that the players made worked? It works FINE IF people respect other guilds and players. The problem is that when people don't let others in on some parts of the game by the power their guild has that rules like PnP get shoved down everyone's throats.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I'm glad other have made the arguments against KidF's "anti-list" stance.  I didn't want to have to go into one of those long debates where I pull out point after point, only to have them sidestepped and deflected with emotional arguments and demeaning remarks, like that I'm a greedy, short-sighted powercamper.  Clearly we are both going to continue believing what we believe, although I can be smug knowing that it seems that most people I encounter agree with my take on the situation.  Much of what has been said is what I would have said, more or less.<P>However, I would like to expound on what is 'fair':  Perhaps it is the 'fairest', i.e., the most equitable possible distribution of spawns, to have a ever growing rotation (even if it is a maintenance nightmare).  If you consider strict evenness to equate to fair, then I will grant you, such a system would be 'fairest'.  But if you value this form of 'fairness' above all else, that would imply you also think that King Solomon's decision to split the disputed baby in half was 'fairest' to both the mothers claiming ownership.  And such a view would also indicate you think communism is the clearly the best form of government.<P>To that I would have to say: Get out of my game you baby-killing commie pinko bastard.<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Lucy: "Equal doesn't mean "right now," equal means "everybody has to endure the same method of gaining access to a spawn"<P>No it doesn't.  You are flat out wrong.  If the method of gaining access is a guild camping a spawn, then I do NOT have to endure that along with everyone else.  If someone decides that they are the arbiter of a list that dictates who gets to fight there I most certainly do NOT have to "endure" that.  Aside from Verant policty or a GM decision, no player is going to tell me what I have to endure because they want more xp.  BS.<P>-"I think most people on the board have shown that they understand what "sharing" means."<P>Actually I would say that most of the spawn campers who are vocal enough to post here have absolutely no idea what sharing is.  You refuse to answer my questions giving hypothetical in-game situations so you can explain how list camping is any different from guild camping, aside from who gets to make the list.  Apparently you, and many of the people here, think that sharing is creating a list of who gets to fight and then enforcing the list as if EQ is your personal little dictatorship.  Can you really post with a straight face that this list method is more of a sharing approach than a simple, standard rotation where everyone who comes gets on the list??? HOW????<P>-"It's much more efficient for each kid to cut out the whole square then pass the scissors to the next kid. "<P>So once again, you have decided that it is your right to determine what is the most efficient way for me and everyone else to play the game??  Thanks, I'll pass.<P>-"people who really love to invoke the PnP) starts getting all antsy and hyperactive and ADD and decides, "Forget this! I want the scissors now!"<P>STOP.  Why do you keep saying the same thing and not listening.  I AM NOT SAYING I WANT A SPAWN RIGHT NOW.  I am saying that everyone who comes to a camp deserves to get IN THE ROTATION immediately.   That doesn't mean they get the spawn now. Stop saying that.  It means they get in line JUST like everyone else.  Why can't you grasp that????  No one is saying give me the spawn now.  They are saying put me in the rotation now.  Comprende???<P>-"You make it seem like a group who has a list will be there for hours and hours with nobody leaving to give other people a chance. That's not true, and it just doesn't happen."<P>Really, you're telling me what happens on every server 24/7??  Wow, great, I guess camping isn't a problem after all.  No one would (gasp) hog a camp for themselves  for hours on end would they??<P>Cecil: "If what I am reading into your comments is accurate, you expect to use PnP to go anywhere you choose in the game at any time and do what you want to do."<P>Nope.  Not even close.  I don't know where you drew that impression.  I said all rotations at spawns should be open to whoever shows up.  Just like the game used to be played.  Trust me. I've been there. It works fine, and camping was never the issue it is today because of greedy players who don't want to share xp.<P>-"Most of these PnP evokers at the upper levels are Ebayers and well known and often brag about how much money they makev"<P>I have no idea if that is the case.  It's not with me.  Most people I know who don't like camping are casual players who are forced to evoke PnP because idiots got the notion that they owned every spawn they sat down at.   Everyone keeps saying "you can go somewhere else."  Yeah, thanks, I'm glad people can feel free to tell us to just walk around because they got a nice spawn to sit at and don't want to share.<P>-"It works FINE IF people respect other guilds and players."<P>Unfortunately I stopped playing the game for 6 months and when I came back it was no longer EverQuest, it was EverCamp.  Face it, from the low levels up, people got the attitude that it was their right to take and OWN a spawn site.  That is a bad concept. It's bad for the game.  And it's bad for the players in every way. Verant stepped in and finally issued pnp.  If you think that was only done to stop uberguilds from farming the upper level items you're mistaken. As Abashi has said many times it was to stop ALL perceived ownership of spawn sites.  It's not first come first serve.  Sorry if you don't like the rules.  I think it's great and I'll gladly invoke it every time some idiot tells me the spawn is camped and that I should go somewhere else.  If those people put me on their "blacklists" that's fine with me.  I wouldn't want to fight with them anyway.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

You have refused to look at the negative aspects of the PnP and blindly say it works.  NO ONE, and I mean NO ONE is entitled to ANY spawn.  No one can simply show up and take over a spawn that has been camped by the same group for the past 8 hours.  You keep throwing out all this common curtesy(sp?) and you fail to realize that it is common curtesy(sp?) that wou wait your turn in line.

</FONT><HR>Your contention that whomever gets there first should own the spawn until they leave, Egodonor, is simply stupid.  Verant knows this: hence the Play Nice policy.  Think about it.<P>1. EQ is played around the world.  Should prime-time players in Japan have a harder time getting good spawns because the late-night US players are holding them all?<P>2. EQ is played by people with widely varying amounts of time available for EQ.  The spawn policy needs to be fair for people who play for a couple hours a night as well as those who play for 16.<P>For a spawn management policy to be fair, it needs to meet at least two requirements:<P>1. It is not biased toward people who play at any particular time.<P>2. It is not biased toward people who play different amounts of time.  Two characters with approximately the same /played time should have had approximately equal chances at things.<P>The "Play Nice" policy accomplishes this.  The "I was here first, so f**k off" policy you advocate does not.<P>"Play Nice" is not perfect, but it is better than any policy that does not satisfy the two properties I list above.  Verant could make it better by making all spawns random, so that your chances of getting a given rare drop off a known spawn depend *entirely* on the number of times you kill it...then "Play Nice" is fair to everyone.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

They are different in such an obvious way, I can't believe you have bothered to repeat this point, as if it was your primary argument against a list policy.

Then, when they get access, they have to &lt;B&gt;share&lt;/B&gt; with five other people.  BTW, to demonstrate that I am adequately qualified to use share in a sentence, and know what it means, I will cite Merriam-Webster: "to divide and distribute in shares; to partake of, use, experience, occupy, or enjoy with others; to have in common; to grant or give a share in; to have a share; to apportion and take shares of something".<P>If a guild continually puts new people into the group exclusively from their own guild, never letting Player X get access to some uber XP spawn, or uber loot dropper, that is wrong.  We all agree to this, including Abashi and Verant.<P>An open invite policy onto a list, first come, first served, is the compromise worked out amongst the vast player community.  Hell, I wish lists were used &lt;B&gt;more often&lt;/B&gt;.  It would be nice to see the ancient crocodile camped by an ever-changing group of 6, with them doing 'order of arrival' split on the gator armor drops.  Alot more fair than letting someone sit there for an unspecific number of hours, although most people do have a sense of fiarness, and will acquiesce the spawn once they acquire their desired item if another person is clearly waiting.<P>A "list to get in" is how the democracy that is the player base has chosen to apportion spawns.  And yes, you do have to endure that along with everyone else.  &lt;B&gt;I&lt;/B&gt; am not forcing down your throat that it is my "right to determine what is the most efficient way for me and everyone else to play the game".  &lt;B&gt;We&lt;/B&gt; are doing so.

</FONT><HR>Just registering my experience. I too have only encountered PnP in a situation where it was abused by another player to force themselves into mundane (i.e. no special loot) camps that were already supporting the maximum number of players that could be efficiently supported. In one case, me and a friend we having fun keeping up with the 3-spawn aviak guards in Lake Rathe. Some necro comes up and says "I'll take every third spawn, and if you don't like it I'll call a GM". That was literally his introduction. We moved to the open spawn on the next island and he died trying to hold his stolen camp. Next time I encountered it was someone trying to force his way into a group of close friends, claiming that if we didn't include him he had full rights to kill steal from our camp. We told him to go stuff himself, which was smart, because grouping with him later showed he had no grouping skills and was a loose cannon that got groups killed. Were we adding people to the group we would have added one of the three polite people who asked first, but we weren't; we had a full-efficiency situation going, which is both rare and very fun, and the claim jumper had plenty of other options.<P>Both these situations happened on Torv which definitely does not have a crowding problem.<P>The abuse of PnP is a major problem, and I'm glad I've gotten to a level where anyone who would use it in such a fashion might as well delete their character afterwards for all the cooperation they would receive from other players. The policy should only allow GM intervention when there is a large-scale conspiracy to keep prime hunting/loot areas to a small or exclusive group for an unreasonable length of time. A few hours hunting with friends having fun is hardly unreasonable.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The thing I was talking about the endless loop is who wants to wait 30 minutes to get one spawn just for xp?  Say Im camping the sewers in Cazic Thule.  If there were 5 groups there, the experience would not be worth a damn.  And almost nothing rare drops there (except occasional decayed.)  Am I getting xp worth my time?  No.  Are any of the other 5 groups getting any xp?  Barely.  So why come in and declare PnP for another split?  It just ruins everyone's night after awhile.  One split is ok, heck even two sometimes.  But if you had to let every person that wanted the AoF spawn or HK warrior spawn in you'd kill something like every 30 minutes.  Sure I move on after Ive been somewhere after a couple of hours usually.  But why force yourself in if you aren't getting anything worth the effort?  Ive seen PnP rules used to this end to frustrate players into giving up a spawn.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Again. PnP DOES NOT MEAN YOU GET TO FIGHT OUT OF TURN OR TAKE OVER A SPAWN!!  Where are you getting that from???!?!  It means you get to be put in LINE in a fair manner just like the people who are already there.  It means you have the same access to fight there as everyone else, including the fact that you have to wait your turn.

</FONT><HR>"Most people I know who don't like camping are casual players who are forced to evoke PnP because idiots got the notion that they owned every spawn they sat down at."<P>I will say it again, I am predominately a casual player who partakes in long sessions such a planar runs or high level raids on occasion. I have seen PnP being abused, not used.<P>Case in point the first time I saw it used:<P>Lower Guk, 6am EST during the middle of the week. There were about 30 people in guk when one of the well known and respected players /ooc's from the zone line that he is forming a frogluk king party and need a couple of tanks, a cleric, an enchanter, and a monk to pull. Some of us get together and form up at the zone line and meet at the bridge to the tower. We fight our way through the maze and back to the room where the king is located. Anyone who has done this knows there are risks involved breaking a full spawn. I follow the monk to be the chain puller and plant myself in one corner while the monk attempts to split a spawn. He gets toasted once then on a couple split ones come back about the time I chain pull and I get toasted once. Finally we split the spawns and have control of the room and pulling from behind us (huge elemental area) also. Well one person decided to tag along behind us and as soon as he saw we had it broke up and announced he was taking every other king and used PnP do to it. He couldn't have broken the spawn himself, no way. And he wasn't after EXP just items from the king. PnP just got abused.<P>Since then I have seen the exact same thing happen in solb, the frenzy, the ghoullord, etc. One person capable of soloing a mob but completely unable to break the spawn using PnP to go after not exp but items by using other people's effort without risk to themselves. This is the abuse of PnP I see all the time, I have never seen it used in a manner which by any stretch of the imagination goes by what you are saying it is for.<P>I am going to say this ONE MORE TIME. I am a casual player and I hate lists but I hate PnP even worse because it is abused more than I see it used in the spirit you say it is for. I also hate going after items but that is the nature of the game, items do matter if you intended to explore ALL of the game. I have no interest in hanging around the commons, the karanas', or the rathe all of my character's existance whether or not I RP or not, which I often do.<P>And I am going to say this also. PnP has caused more player anarchy and any other thing in the game. I hunt for exp and I camp for items on occasion. And as I have said before if you come up to me and ask to get in rotation on a exp spawn I will GLADLY do it, most people will from what I have witnessed long before PnP. But the abuse of PnP is a harvestor's dream come true and I am sorry you just don't see it.<P>You left for 6 months? Ok let me guess some of the things you have missed.<P>1. A new area opens up and the first few days items and exp fall like mana from heaven, those that are there benefit the most, those that aren't find out that a "mistake" has been made and it gets changed. Happened in Kunark, happened in Fear and Hate also. People learn be there first or be left out. You can call this powergaming if you wish but in reality the game is designed towards powergamers, else equipment and level would mean nothing and a level one could go back and take a peak at a level 53 dragon if he wanted.<P>2. Innovative first time players in a new area do things VI never thought could be done. This in turn causes them to buff the mobs, they have a "us and our mobs" versus "the players" mentality about things like this. Naggy and Vox are on steroids compared to what they were over a year ago. People that get there first are once again rewarded because they have the benefit of being able to do some of these uber mobs with less people thereby increasing the chances of them getting equipment upgrades for the vitality of their character. Again the only thing almost more important than level when trying to explore the whole world of Norrath is equipment. The game is designed in that manner.<P>3. The death penalty, not the exp loss the time loss. I have been on CR's that have taken several hours in Chardock, and even days in Fear. Now a lot of the nicest players I know on the server that would give you the shirt of their back camp for exp so they can afford to lose it on a raid, that is the nature of the system by design. Toss in the low cash drops at the higher levels in Kunark and some people HAVE to camp greens just to fund raids. Try getting a corpse out of chardock near the castle without 150p for that coffin for instance. You can make 150p is a few hours in many of the 30ish areas but go and hunt in many kunark outdoor areas it might take days to get 150p, at least that is true the last time I hunted there. Sure you can go and harvest items in underused dungeons to sell but the item envy in the game is amazing even amoung the so called roleplayers. I have seen people laugh about bronze armor for sale, grotesque masks, BIM's, etc. They want quest armor, dented masks, and high level +wis +int gear even in the teen levels. Thus you see a 50+ cleric killing skellies in guk or a wizard killing green specters for exp putting more pressure on exp areas while Runnyeye, Permafrost, and Najena remains empty.<P>There is nothing wrong with your opinion, but a lot of us have seen how PnP doesn't work because of the very reasons it was started, jerks who don't respect the other people in the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I think much of that attitude still permeates today, which is why Verant had to issue the PnP policies. Back in the good old days (over a year ago) people would allow anyone who walked up to a spawn to rotate in. There was generally no need for GM's to moderate anything. Unfortunately this system slowly deteriorated with the farming, uberguilds, twinkers, and powerlevelers to the point where people thought they owned camps. In fact, you could have logged in to Lake Rathe and seen a dozen ooc shouts saying: "Is xyz camped", "Yes, xyz is camped." Which was basically totally bs, and meant, yeah, it's our camp, go away. So Verant finally responded with PnP rules, which have come way too late to change the attitudes of the thousands of powercampers on the servers who think that first come means forever served.&gt;&gt;&gt;<P>Where did you look at the negative aspects of PnP?<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;I've played the game a long time and I totally disagree that pnp was not needed. I'm not a newbie, or a child, and I can tell you that the whole attitude of "this is my camp, go away" had gotten RIDICULOUS before pnp was implemented. People just took over in a way that forced Verant to implement some kind of policy, however inadequate to deal with it. I had long arguments with people prior to pnp who honestly felt that if they had a camp staked it it was THEIRS, and they didn't have to share it. Well, Verant pretty much backed up my side of the argument with a big I DON'T THINK SO to all the powercampers. You don't own anything in this game, especially spawn sites. If you can't find a way to rotate people in immediately then you don't need to play a multiplayer game. There shouldn't have to be any begging, or bickering over camps. If someone shows up they have just as much right to get into the rotation as the people sitting there. Period.&gt;&gt;&gt;<P>Again, where did you look at the negative aspects of PnP?<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;Just because there are plenty of places to fight doesn't mean any player has the right to say "this is mine, go somewhere else."  Nothing in the game is owned by any player. Period. So a spawn site is already crowded and you don't want to share? Tough luck.  The guy who just walked up to the spawn has the exact same right to fight there as you do. This first come, it's mine garbage is just that. Garbage. So the game is crowded and you don't want to share your camp? Tough, the game is crowded for everyone. It doesn't mean you get the right to monopolize a spawn because people can "fight somewhere else." If you don't want to share, YOU go fight somewhere else.&gt;&gt;&gt;<P>Negative aspects?  I guess not.<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;Lucy, I think that the PnP system works exactly as it should in this case. I understand how the HK system works and it's wrong.  Why? Because it's EXACTLY the reason that Verant implemented the PnP rules in the first place. Making up a list of people and allowing them to rotate in when other people leave is not the way Verant wants the game played, and neither do the majority of players. That's called monopolizing a spawn, and it stinks. The only way people are allowed into the rotation is when someone decides to leave. I don't pay $9.95 a month, just like everyone else in the game, so I can wait around until some guy decides he's done fighting. I'll make this very clear, and this is what Verant has already stated: Anyone who walks up to a camp has the right to be put into the rotation IMMEDIATELY. That DOESN'T mean they get to skip people on the list, or move ahead of anyone who is waiting.  It means that they get to fight after the LAST person there gets their turn. What is wrong with that?? <P>People think that if there are already 6 people there, the spawn should be closed to new people, so they don't have to share xp.  Sorry, but just because the servers are overcrowded doesn't give anyone a right to close down a spawn and claim ownership. The servers are crowded for everyone and I don't know where in the world people think that first come gives them entitlment. I repeat, NO ONE gets to walk up and start fighting at a spawn out of turn under PnP rules. All they do is force groups to let new people into the rotation immediately upon arriving, in a FAIR and appropriate order to when they arrived. Why is that so hard to comprehend. No one is being cheated. No one gets to fight out of order. I have seen a full rotation used with 15 people in the old days and no one had a problem. If you have a problem with too many people being in a rotation at a spawn then complain to Verant about overcrowding or go to another spawn. You don't get the right to force people to wait on a list until you decide you're done fighting.&gt;&gt;&gt;<P>I'm still looking for those negative aspects...<P>I'm not gonna put up anymore of your posts because they all say the same thing.  I do however want to address your issue with lists not providing equal access to spawn.  I disagree with that.  If EVERYONE abides by the same rules and uses the previous system of waiting on a list, I don't see how it is unfair.  There is something called common courtesy, where you wait your turn for something.  <P>The reason I continued to point out that you did not address the negative aspects of PnP in your posts is because you are being a hippocrit.  You blindly support PnP refusing to acknowledge it's downsides.  Before you accuse others of being ignorant and blind, maybe you should look at all sides to the arguement first.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I have only invoked PNP once.  After logging onto EQ one day after work, I proceeded to go to my favorite singleton spawn to see if anyone was there.  As usual, there were a couple of folks already there going at it hard.  I asked to get into the rotation for the mob.  I was promptly told that it was camped. Fine, I then asked if they would please give me a tell before they left. No response.  I wander around that zone killing those random blues that I was able to find for awhile, then over into one of the adjacent zones I go for a longer period.  After about 3 hours I make my way back and sure enough they are still there.  I ask politely how much longer they were planning on being at the spot, and once again I get no response.  I then reiterate that I would very much like to share the spawn, I propose that they get two out of three. Terse reply "Its camped."  I then decide to invoke the PNP policy.  I politely state that said policy states that they must share.  They deny the fact.  After arguing with them for about 5 more minutes I then say that I'm sorry that you feel this way, perhaps we need a GM to sort it out.  INSTANT profanity.  To make a long story short, the GM shows up about 15 minutes later, during which time they still are taking all the pops, and after a short investigation enforces the PNP rule.  By then a couple of guildmates of one of the aforementioned players have arrived and I get the "now noone will let you in on plane and dragon raids" threat.  I only have two things to say about that.  Firstly, I was only level 24 at the time and it was gonna be a LOOOONG time before I would even reach an adequate level to attempt it.  Secondly, my initial response to the one player's stream of profanity pretty much sums up my outlook on the whole situation, which was "Honey, I don't MAKE the rules of this game, I just PLAY by em."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004652-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004652.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004652-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004652-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004652&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004652&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
