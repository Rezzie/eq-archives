And by the way, as the title implies, this post is intended for a different sort of newbie: those of us who are new to the endgame (50+).  Not restricted to them by any means, but more relevant to the middle years (30 - 49).<P>So, to begin: although I have been playing for slightly more than a year now, I have never gotten an avatar past 39th.  This is mostly because I have too many alts on too many server (full dockets on 2 servers, scattered twos and threes on 5 others) and also because I really enjoy exploring the beginning of the game with every class/race combo I can find even a little interest in.  Sadly, though, I have hooked up with a really great group of people (not a guild, just a group) who have pet avatars that they insist on playing on a regular basis.<P>All of which means that I had to pick one of mine to do the same, and--unsurprisingly--I picked my druid.  We are now all well past 30 and heading for the higher levels (new territory for all of us) and as a result I have a new perspective on the game re all the patching and balancing going on in the last few months.<P>In essence, it boils down to this: the patches and balancing do absolutely nothing to make the game itself good or bad.  To use a possibly dubious analogy, like guns there are no good or bad games, only good or bad people--which is my clumsy way of saying that the game is what it is, and the perception of the individual is what colors it.<P>What brought this thought on is the realization that, since I do have avatars of every race/class combo that interests me, practically every patch or balance affects me (or will affect me in the sweet by and by) one way or another.  At first, I really worried about them--I mean, why waste time leveling up an avater if the class was so heavily nerfed that it was going to be useless?  Then, like a bolt from the blue, I realized that all of the changes to the end game--and I mean ALL of them--have, in reality, absolutely no effect on me whatsoever (IMHO, natch).<P>Why?--I hear you ask.  Well, good question--which leads me into a side anecodote concerning a phenomenon I call The New Movie Hoax.  This involves the hype put out by the movie-making media concerning all new movies, to the effect that you ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO SEE THEM WHILE THEY ARE NEW, and the implication that if you don't, you're some sort of loser.  Some years ago (approximately at the time the theaters started charging more for a movie and snacks than it costs to by a filet mignion dinner with all the trimmings) I came to a stunningly simple conclusion concerning those movies that has saved me thousands of dollars since: any movie is new to me the first time I see it, no matter how old the movie actually is.  What you are actually paying through the nose for is the experience of seeing it in the theater--an experience I don't particularly enjoy (at least not at 15 bucks a pop minimum, assuming I'm not out with someone) and therefore can do without.<P>The relevance of this anecodote to 30+ endgame newbies is simple: the endgame is new to everyone the first time they get there, no matter what has been done to it prior to their arrival.  Does that mean no one should whine--er, pardon me, justifiably complain--about changes?  Not at all.  To those that are already in the theater, having the air conditioniong shut off really sucks.  What it does mean is that, to anyone who has not yet arrived, none of these whines--damn! Sorry, complaints--should put you off or deter you in any way.<P>Keep these thoughts always in your mind as you grind your way to the 50's: nerfage cannot affect patterns of play that you have not yet developed.  Nothing done to your class at a certain level can affect you before you achieve that level.  By the time you achieve the nerfed level new patterns of play will have evolved to compensate and/or take advantage of the most recent nerf (keep an eye on your favorite spoiler site).<P>Above all, keep in mind that this game, like all of the others (I hope) is not a static thing that was once perfect before it was nerfed; it is, instead, an ongoing process during which mistakes will be made by the designers--mistakes that, one assumes, are the results of trying to improve the game instead of maliciously making it worse (because we all know that Verant really, REALLY wants to make the game so bad that no one will pay them 5 million dollars a month to play it).<P>That's all for now, got to actually get some work done so that I can contribute my part of the 5 mil to play this lousy, maliciously nerfed game.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Llanwe na Finn<BR>Druid, Daughter of Tunare<BR>May She be with you in all of the dark places where you must walk.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I've been playing for a long time now, and I never tire of finding new experiences or exploring new areas of the game.  Even though I have 2 avatars over 50, I would dare say that I still have over 1/2 of the game to see!  <P>The "Middie-Syndrome," levels 30-49ish, is a common and unavoidable malady unless you play with someone who has been there before.  At this point in the game, you have the game experience to know what you're doing (for the most part), but don't yet have the knowledge/skills to play the high end game.  This is also the point where you leave the low-end zones for good.  No more LOIO (unless you go back for Bloodgills), no more High Keep, no more South Karana.  Now it's time to enter the world of Lower Guk and Nagafen's Lair (Sol B).<P>Ok, someone shoot me, I digress off-topic way too easily, hehe.  <P>Personally I view patches and changes to the game (aka nerfs) as just another challenge to overcome.  For example, Monday the Paladin AA ability Slay Undead is being changed.  As a Paladin, this affects me directly, but I also agree with the nerf completely.  It was overpowering.  Now, I'll need to think about how this affects me when I am battling undead mobs and adjust my gameplay accordingly.<P>Sometimes I wish some of the people that complain about nerfs the most had played when I started playing, hehe.  There were more patches the first 6 months of the game than you could shake a stick at.  Changing spell names (ie Dead Man Floating was originally Dead Man Walking), adding zones (Temple of Solusek Ro), and all SORTS of balancing issues.  While not perfect, Everquest has come a long way in making things much more balanced than they have ever been.  <P>On a personal aside, the majority of those that complain about the nerfs so vehemently are those that only play a class due to its overall power.  Kinda like everyone playing mages in UO or AC.  If being the most powerful is what matters most to you, go get Diablo or something.  /rant off<P>Sweet!  I think I've talked about a dozen different things in this post... maybe I should try and drink some coffee before posting in the morning, hehe.<P>Binuru Soie'Couteau<BR>Arch Protector<BR>Knights of the Holy Storm<BR>Erollisi Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

She is now 52nd. Below her I have one in the mid-40s, three in the 30s, a couple in the 20s and half a dozen or more in their teens. They are spread over 6 or 7 servers, too.<P>I might get to the higher levels one day. I am not actively avoiding it, but I just find the lower levels are still far too much fun to move on from. As for leaving Lake of Ill Omen and South Karana behind, I don't even stop hunting there with my 40+ and 50+ characters!<P>If you aren't interested especially in raising the level of a particular character, then yu don't "outgrow" zones. I personally love all the plains of Karana and spend hours roaming around them. One of my main motivations in getting up as far as the 40s and low 50s was to have characters who could roam freely in the zones I loved and take down pretty much anything they felt like.<P>It's a minority choice of playstyle, but it's not completely weird. There were some figures released a year or two back on players with multiple mid-level characters and it was something around 15 to 20 per cent of the population. <P>The key to enjoying EQ is to make the game fit your playstyle, not to change your playstyle to fit in with the game. If EQ can't be used as raw material for the game you want to play, then it probably isn't the game you want to be playing in the first place. <P>It's a very flexible, versatile environment - I've played all the other big MMORPGs and some of the smaller ones and not one is as open to interpretation in how the player approaches it as EQ (UO comes closest, probably). <P>At all costs, don't get sucked into the "must level - must get to 60th - must have Epic Weapon - must have Uber equipment" syndrome. If those are natural goals for you, then reaching them won't be painful. If it feels like more work than play, then you have probably taken on board someone else's goals - take a step back and choose some of your own.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

It has been mostly static in many ways for three and a half years. Due to it being so static for so long, players balk when the fundmental abilities of their class are changed. This is what happened to monks.<P>Mana burn is a newer thing, which came with luclin, so it more of a non-static nerf. Even if you take the monk time from when kunark came out you have a period of something like 2 and a half years.<P>Saying the game is "ever changing" is the same copout that verant tries to use anytime a change for the worse happens to the way that  customer plays. I think that we'd understand that more and accept it as a statement of fact if I was not fighting the same three orc camps in WC and EC that I have been since EQ beta phase 3. The only new thing is that they now drop some newb quest items.<P>I'd suggest that you take one of the myriad of characters, on various servers which you play on, to the end game. That end game is currently level 60 and soon to be 65. At that point, looking at the three and a half years that EQ has been running, you can then have some more perspective.<P>The monk problem is unique since, as other posters have said, it does not affect the uber people it was perhaps meant for. It affects more middling high level players the worst, those with below 1200 ac or so. I know a level 43 monk who got back into the game who says that at his level the change is not that bad because he gets hit for more but gets hit a lot LESS than he was. From his talks with higher level monks this will rapidly change for him. <P>Verant themselves have said that they don't like to change long standing abilities in the game unless they are for the better, or someway improve the class. What monks do defensively has been long standing since Kunark arrived, years ago. Up until now most long standing changes HAVE been imrovements, such as the game altering standing ovation hybrid xp and mana pool changes (A long requested change, by players on these boards)<P>I play a level 56 druid, unlike other druids I don't see anything wrong with the class because ALL we've had are improvements. They made our dot do less damage when the mob was moving but at the same time they GREATLY improved our root, in fact they fixed it so it ROOTED AT ALL. Recently they even removed the lower damage when the mob was moving. What most of the druid complaints stem from are NEW things that other classes are more in demand for such as AOE grouping. The BULK of the complaining druids are level 60.<P>The druid problem is a sharp contrast to the monk one, in that it is a NON problem. There is no problem with the class and nothing was lost. I've never expected to be queen of the AOE group with my druid, in fact, I've seen FAR more with this class improved than I've EVER expected. I expected it to be a lone caster, out in the wilderness, with crummy equipment. Due to vast improvements in the game and new spells and skills, its become far more than that and more of an all around swiss army knife group AND soloing character.<P>Meanwhile, the monk change is something fundamental which was an accepted part of the class. It would be as though they suddenly removed the druid's ability to solo as well, making it so our only choice was grouping while not adding anything to make us more desireable in groups. My realizing that though, I don't play a monk, is called empathy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I have a level 44 Wizard.  I never had Manaburn.  Now that it is almost pointless to have, I doubt I ever will.  But the Monk thing was fundemental to the class.  Many people chose to be Monks based upon the ability to tank better than, well, tanks.<P>If Verant were to come out tomorrow and say, "We've decided Wizard ports are too unbalancing.  We want to take them away."  Well, I'd be upset.  Oh, wait, PoP is supposed to make all those porting spells pointless.  Sorry, I forgot.  Never mind.

Mages were MADE to be soloing class players, they have vertually NOTHING a group wants until AE group levels. Until then it is solo or shout for a group and get LAUGHED out of zone. <P>Just about aug of 2000 ALL pets were SEVERELY nerfed. My pets were white to yellow to me one day, a patch happened, and then it took TWO stacks of malachite to get ONE blue pet, and it died in five seconds fighting the exact same mobs I had fought the night before. It took me more than two months to find the ONE mob that I could level to the next pet level off of.<P>The Mage class has been repeatedly nerfed, in KEY spells/abilities/pets. BUT as a mage, I am used to this, and stubborn enough to say I DARE YOU to try and crush me out of this game Verant. And Clever enough to figure out how to survive any nerf.<P>And yes there have been nerfs that have had to be UNnerfed due to customer complaints, it has taken mages two to three YEARS to get the unnerfing or ballances, but we are persistant.<P>Claryn Starcaster 59 Magi</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

She said she was in the 'middle years' (30-49), and a complete newbie with regards to the endgame (50+).<P>I do have a couple of comments with regards to the recent "nerfs", and how they affect the players.  A few have implied that some 'nerfs' are OK in that they are just part of the ever changing nature of EverQuest, and other nerfs are not, since they change something that has been there since day 1.<P>As an example of this, Aandaie suggests the 'manaburn' nerf would likely fall in the first category, while the change to monks is of the second type.  Here I disagree.  While monks have had their defensive ability since the beginning of EQ, the armor and equipment available to them is a more recent (and gradual) addition.  It is only recently that a <I>significant number</I> of monks have surpassed the AC 'soft cap'.  This, in combination with high +hp gear has allowed the monk to surpass plate-wearing classes in the traditional role of main tank.  <P>If you consider this in combination with high damage output, as well as class abilities like feign death, and mend, then you can understand why the situation had to be fixed (read: nerfed).  There is no point to a warrior if another class is superior in virtually all respects.<P>How does this change affect players that have got used to their monks as they were?  Obviously there is a significant adjustment to be made.  Does it make the monk obsolete though?  Definately not.  How does it affect lower level monks, that weren't in the habit of tanking 'endgame' mobs?  It doesn't other than as a perception issue if they were looking forward to that role.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=030661&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=030661&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
