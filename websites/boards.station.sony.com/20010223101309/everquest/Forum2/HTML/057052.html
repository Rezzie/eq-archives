I know, your first question is going to be, how did I decide to pick druids to be next? Well, honestly, it just came up in conversation today with a co-worker. There’s no trick to it. I would certainly address the ones most in need first, but until I’ve actually done all these posts, I won’t know which is most in need… (let’s not make that the topic of this post, please)<BR>So the question is, what is it that the druid community thinks they need to become a ‘balanced’ class? What is lacking? What is over-powered? - yes, that’s a valid question for any class –<P>This time I’m starting this post with very little information to lead with, so I feel like I’m at a bit of a disadvantage. I do know that, like many other classes, some druids feel that they don’t have enough to do while at the final encounter of the big raid. One of the suggestions to change that falls along the same lines as one proposed by the shaman community, changing/improving their healing abilities post 50.<P>I want you to understand that I think druids are pretty well balanced all around, and I really see little that needs to be changed (and that’s partially why I picked them to be the topic today…). So you’ll have to be convincing, logical and articulate to convince me. <P>Alan<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The healing changes on test don't go far enough imo. <BR>Druids are still a distant 3 rd when it comes to the priest classes, res+ch and slow+haste will get clerics and shamans into groups ahead of druids the same as they always have.<P>My only complaint is that group desirability is so unbalanced. Solo power, healing power, whatever the source is, the overall packages need to balance in regard to how desirable they are to groups. <P>In other words most of us dont care how you go about making groups want our class, as long as you do. <P>An *idea* that would be great in conjunction with the healing changes would be to add a high level CASTER version of slow, something like "Stunning Swarm" basically a low dmg dot that interupts casters in the way that slow reduces the number of swings a mob gets. The spell would interupt 50 % of a mob's casts. Basically it's a dot with a recorruing interupt effect used to reduce teh number of succesful casts a caster mob can get off in a period of time. Would be considered highly desirable when fighting mobs that gate. Or it could just somehow directly slow down the casting sppeed of mobs, rather than interupting them. Either way the idea is that a mob that would normally cast like 10 spells in a fight, would now be able to cast like 3 or 4. <P>This would give druids a bit off a poor man's crowd control for dealing with casters, root em and slow their casting in conjunction with the new heals would really created a viable group friendly role for druids.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok my post above was a bit sloppy so I'll attemot to restate it more clearly.<P>The healing changes on test are nice but not enough to really get us into groups much more than currently. The they do slightly ease the "no cleric no game" syndrome though and that's far more important overall. <P>A spell that makes groups say "boy it would be nice to have a druid" would really help. My idea was a spell that slows CASTER mobs, basically by either interupting them with a reoccuring stun effect dot. Or just a general debuff that slows the rate between casts or the actual delay per cast. From a rp'ing view you could look at it as using the mastery of nature to block the flow of power between the character and his source of magic. <P>The main things are that people of every class need to be in the same ballpark when it comes to group desireability and so far they aren't. The healing and hybrid changes, in conjunction with a few changes to classes, like the caster slow I suggested, are all it takes to get a good overall balance. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>NinjaMan:  I advocated for 44, but would have been happy at 49.  51 isn't much of a change, although it'll help with the fizzle.  I think Verant's thinking was that as druids were "balanced" pre-RoK, they didn't want to mess with our sub-50 spell lists.  As they've messed with sub-50 mobs in Kunark and Velious, that reasoning appears to be mistaken, IMHO.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Faydedar... why is it that most everyone elses uber mob is triggered but we get to play camp-fest and hope that no uber guilds decide they really need him more than I do??<BR>This was presented as our 'class defining item', but it has turned into a 'I have more time and my guild is bigger than yours' competition....<BR>VS only spawns once a week AND we have to compete with Rangers for the stone, but worse case scenario is that you would get 2 druid epics a week, which is a worse ratio than most others that need similar dragon types, which are on 3 days spawns.... get rid of his dragon loot, set him up similar to the elemental in BW for the cleric epic.. he drops our item and one goodie for those that help......<P>Verm... If we had the best AC of the priest classes, it would make sense.. MORE armor, MORE weight... however we have the WORST AC of all the priest classes , with our AC slightly above that of casters.... the logic behind this escapes me... <P>Spell drops.. how can I be a 'balanced' class if I can't get my spells? How about taking the armor from the melees and then saying how well balanced they are... The necros get quests for their rare spell pages in Neriak, why not set up quests to get everyones 50+ spells, similar to the sad Charm Plant spell?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just had another thought to add for a spell idea.<BR>How about some kind of Symbol/talisman type spell that requires foraged items to cast? Taking from the Protection of the Glades spell. Make this spell come at level 52.It would only have the AC and a smaller mana regen. It could last for one hour and be group casted. It may or may not be able to stack with cleric buffs. Although i prefer it would. But it would give us one more group friendly spell. Maybe even make it require 4 or 6 of the reagent to cast.I would also ask that it be vendor bought, or added to the 52nd level quested spells(circle of summer,winter etc).The reagents would have to be exsisting and stackable in order to be really used.ORthey could be store bought. but it'd have to besomething like an herb the shamans buy from vendors. Dunno if this will get skipped, but i think its a good idea. I can't see any unbalancing effect unless it was self only.It should however stack with our Skin and Thorncoat lines. Ah well. its just an idea.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I stoped playing my druid at level 52.<P>Reson to this was I noticed I had no room in groups, I filled no role. Anything I could do others could do aswell, ether just as good or better.<P>Only thing I ever got to do in group was Snare and save mana for emergecy evac or keep-alive-til-completeheal-take-effect healing.<P>My DoTs where jokes, by DDs where resisted, my Healing was equal to level 24 clerics.<P>Now, what I notice in this thread and many others is just what I found... Druids need something unique, something that makes them welcome in groups, maybe not to the point that ppl start screaming "we need a druid to be able to do this!", but atleast that we don't have to feel like leaving the group is the best way to efficienly handle the group. That is right, as it is now a level 52 druid don't add enough to a group to even worent the exp-share, and that my friend is sad, real sad.<P>Let me try to give you my picture of the druid class and it's powers...<P>* Healing - Low power healing with little use (Druids are as effective healers as a 25-26 cleric, same healing spell and about the same Fizzle Rate)<P>* DamageShields - Mages got this, they are masters of it, and have a place in group since there pets are powerful and CoH is a nice tool at highlevels.<P>* Nukes - Our Nukes are nice and all, but they get Resisted more then not and are not a very efficient use of mana.<P>* DoTs - Well DoTs are only mana efficient if they can do there full work, will it was a long long time since I saw my DoT end message when in a group...<P>* Teleports - Ok, we got some very nice spells in this category, but so does wizards, and they have a valued service in any highlevel group, they also got monopoly on entring Hate/Sky, so basicly they are the masters of Teleportation.<P>* SoW - Nice and needed, but Shaman and Rangers have this too.<P>* Snare - Absolutly wonderful ability, too bad we are not the masters here eather... Rangers have same snare capabilities, Necros/SKs have a movement reducer also, and Now even a Wizard can do it, and btw, How come the Wizard got a AE Snare and the original Snare class has none?<P>* Wolfform - Once upon a time this was a great ability, now it is a great way of getting you killed, I still am amazed how verant felt making you KoS all over Kunark when in Wolfform was needed, was this ability that overpowered?<P>So, the only place a druid has in the world as it is is as Taxi or PowerLeveling tool. And don't expect you will be able to tag along in the group after you port them to the destination  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Now to some concrete suggestions...<P>* Increese the healing capabilities alittle, The suggestions I read seems like a good step.<P>* Remove the KoS factor if Wolfform and give druids some upgrades to Shared Wolfform.<P>* I would like to see druids get something Like Immobalize, that does not get you summoned for crowd controling.<P>* Add some Fast working DoTs that can actualy be able to do it's full work in a short fight, and be mana efficient.<P>* To make the Skin series of spells stackable with the clerical reso series is a good idea, might make it the same stack as shaman talismans? So it stack with the clerical but not the Talisman series.<P>* Teleports to bind point would be nice, but I htink it would be unbalanced, I would suggest adding alot more ports though, there are still alot of unused "druid circles" around norrath (oot comes to mind), add ports to these. Also, The suggested SFG, WSW and there like would be nice. Another thing that might be considered is making druids able to "bind" to a tree or simular that you have previously visited, and port to there. I have no idea if zones are classified by terrain, if so let a druid bind to a forrest zone with a new spell "Tree Bind" and then have Gate spells to there "Tree". This might be unbalanced, I havn't thought through all places this could be used but it sure would be a nice feature.<P>* Druids/Shaman/Rangers all get Spirit of the Wolf, how about giving druids a slight upgraded version at higher levels, that will add alittle more speed and maybe a levitate component to realy make druids masters of travle. A Good name for such a spell? Spirit of the Bird? *giggle*<P>* When it comes to snares it is hard... Everyone love snare capability in groups, in most cases it is a MUST. To have druids beeing the Masters of this field would not be unthinkable. In that case, add longer duration versions, Lure versions, slower versions, AE versions, nonagroing versions, taunting versions, outdoors versions and indoor versions.<P>I realy don't care what you do to the druids soloing capabilities, I never realy used them, and grouping is by far the most fun way of playing this game, so just make druids group friendly and wanted group members! It is fun to be hack of all trades, but it stops beeing fun if you can't play the game as intended anymore. I would gladly trade all the DoTs for Healing capabilities enough to make a differance on Raids, but that would never happen couse Clerics need to be the only healers in game post 50. Don't get me wrong, Greater Healing is awsome for powerleveling, you can almost heal a 25 warrior to full with 2 of these spells, but on a 60 Warrior with buffs you will not even notice the spell take effect. <P>I would even go so far as to say Clerics got 3 maybe 4 spells they use to heal with at higher levels: Remedy, Divine Light, Complete Heal, Celestial Elixir. Would it be that bad to let Shamans and Druids into the game? Give them Complete Heal (level 39 cleric spell) at level 55, with a 600 mana cost (50% more then clerics), heck up the casting time to 15 seconds (50% more then Clerics) atleast then the druids/shamans can be of alittle use in raids and will be able to heal a buffed warrior, they will be far less effective then a druid, but they will be able to heal. I don't see how this could be out of line considering many classes get druid spells with far less level added to it, example would be Banish Summoned, (Druid 44, Cleric 56). A fix like that would not make clerics less sought after but rather make Druids/Shamans a valid option if no cleric is around.<P>Anyway, I will stop rambling now...<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My Wishlist for Druids<P>Have AE spells reduced in range tremendosly, thereby making it impossible to quad kite.  You want druids to not solo as much this is the way.<P>Move Sup heal to 44, add a remedy type spell at 51.  I'd want it to be POSIBLE that i could keep a warrior the same level as me in HP....right now its a joke.<P>TPs to more places....just to make it easier to get around.<P>Have regrowth at 49, pack regrowth at 54.<P>Give druids SOMETHING unique to do in a group, something that hasnt been thought of yet...dont know what but we need something.<P>Increased (self only) mana regen prior 54.  Obviously this can only go in effect if the quadkiting range thing changes.<P>Change non wis/int stats so they actually have an effect on the game.  This effects shamys more but i'd really feel better knowing my str spell was more then a ego buff.<P>Thats all i got.....feel free to do anything to prevent druids from soloing...its fine with me as long as you buff there grouping ability.<P>Immutable Mutation<BR>Lvl 51 Wanderer, Torvonnilous<BR>Protonite Process<BR>Lvl 33 Warrior<BR>&lt;insert names of 6 twinks here&gt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Hell I cant even charm a gray wolf for more then 10 seconds at a time. And by making them useful I don't mean charm a griffon for hours at a time, but maybe making it a bit more useful on at least blue's and greens.<P>A port spell to Surefall Glades wouldn't be all that bad, there is one to Misty, why there is I have no clue.

</FONT><HR>Ok, I'm lower level (Only 35), but I've done a lot of reading, and I HAVE played a Druid as my main character for my entire time in EQ.  (Since it's release)<P>This is a very general post, hoping to spark new ideas.<P>I agree that Druids are generalists, that is part of their power.  The problem is that at upper levels, it takes the full power of a group of specialists to survive.<P>I agree that a lot of of the tweaking in the above posts are necessary just to keep the Druid useful as the second or THIRD best at something.  There are 14 classes, and 6 max per group, so groups DO need some generalists with crossover abilities.<P>This leaves the need for something defining.  Something that makes high level groups want to have a Druid along.<P>Ideally it would:<BR>1) Not require extensive programming, either due to graphics or effects<P>2) Not be overbalancing<P>3) Be a support based spell/ability, not someting that could be used to increase soloing by Druids.<P>We might be missing a bet however.  Why not combine OUR problems with another classes problems?  Pick another generalist or hybrid that has problems getting into groups at upper levels, and give them a COMBINED effect.  It would have to be pretty nice to make a group want to include TWO generalists classes in a group, but it could be done.<P>For example, if Rangers have a hard time grouping, then give Druid/Ranger combinations a very nice affect.  One idea is to have a spell that could be cast on a Ranger that would gate whatever he is tracking to either the ranger or the Druid.  Limitations would have to be put in place, but the ability to pick mobs out of a grouping into the middle of the group would be just such a killer affect.<P>I could think of several spells that would involve one or more other classes.  A "life/anti-life" effect that would wipe out a shaman/necro pet duo, but do something VERY nasty to the mob they were fighting, or any number of other things.<P>BTW, I LOVE the idea of more "form of's".  A SOW/Lev combo called "form of the sparrow", Water speed/breathing/fighting/seeing spells called "Form of the Barracuda", A shrunken form that only Cat creatures would aggro on called "Form of the Mouse"...  I think these and their group versions would be the PERFECT way to give the Druid unique abilities, but I also think they would ammount to a complete re-write of the class, and as such aint likely to happen.<P>Gaellic<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I didn't read the other threads so I don't know if this has been suggested or not. <P>Let harmony work indoors. To me this solves a lot of problems.<P>All of the underutilized dungeons will now be accessible to groups that don't have an enchanter. Enchanters can be hard to find but as we all know druids (and rangers get harmony) are a dime a dozen. And I think this would benefit high level druids (and rangers) as well. <P>Also I don't see that the ability to pull singles infringes on an enchanters territory. Enchanters will still be wanted for clarity and speed buffs/debuffs. <P>I do understand that Verant wants dungeons to be tough. But the reality is that you have a class that really brings little to the indoor game (except snare) and are left out and you have a dozen dungeon zones that are empty because people can't break them without an enchanter. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alright, enough of this. You people seem to misunderstand Absor, he wants a list of suggestions to BALANCE druids (Read: Make them useful in groups post-50), not unbalance them by adding every wishlist item under the sun.<P>That said, there are only a few things wrong with druids, both fundamentally and level-wise.<P>Firstly, what is our role? What is our specialization? Most would say our specialization is being fairly good at almost everything. Unfortunately, that just doesn't stack up in the post-50 world. You see, if you need something done, post-50 it is far better to get a specialist to do it for you. Example? Let's use the cleric's. As was mentioned before, a level 39 cleric is a more efficient healer than a group of 56 druids (perhaps not post-patch). That is what we must seek to change.<P>Two druids should be able to team up, and heal decently post-50. The way it is now, before any group dare enter the high-level dungeon zones, they REQUIRE a cleric. A level 52 druid can go out of mana, simply by trying to heal an equal level tank up to full from 25%. This is not balance, it is a joke. <P>Moving Superior heal down was a good thing, but it's not down far enough. The level 51+ fizzle rates are rediculously high across the board. This spell will be so fundamentally needed, it MUST be put in the level 50 or less range. Remember, the biggest complaint about superior healing was that it fizzled far too often.<P>Secondly, while we are in the group down in Sebilis, what are we doing when we're not healing the cleric? We're either meditating, ensnaring mobs, or nuking, trying to make ourselves useful. Let's pick ensnare, since that an evac are the only reasons Druids can currently get a group in OS. <P>Elder spiritist's Gauntlets have the effect of our level 1 Snare. This snare lasts two minutes. Considering the effect on our vambraces is a level 34 DoT for 350dmg, would it not be possible to put the level 29 Ensnare spell on these gaunts? As it stands now, the long cast time for such a low level spell is absurd. These gauntlets are never used.<P>Secondly, while we're on snaring, wizards get AE snare before druids do, and when druids DO get AE snare, it's the level 1 snare, which lasts two minutes. Considering our primary role in any 50+ group is going to be not healing, but SNARING, this spell should be changed to the Ensnare type duration. Envision this picture: Tank overpulls, enchanter mezzes the group of four froggies. Druid walks up into the group and does an AE ensnare. Boom, every mob snared, and the druid can get back to his healing much faster.<P>Verant seems to pick the group-buffing role for druids post-50. I can tolerate that, but our buffs do not last even half as long as their single-target equivalents. Why should I pay such a high price just to do all my group members at once? If you want to try to balance things, make the group buffs last as long as the normal ones (Case in point, Group SoW last half as long as normal sow, perhaps less so. No one is going to USE this, the spell wears off far too soon.), but increase the mana cost.<P>Alright, that seems to be it. I'll refrain from the wishlist, but there is something I do want, that is currently done in every zone for enchanters, except with static objects:<P>Random animal form. To say there is no space in the global file, let me explain. The magician summon monster spells summon a pet which takes a random model from the current zone. Thus it is possible to have a pet sand giant while you are in oasis, but not while you are in NK. Enchanters at level 1 get Minor Illusion, a spell which takes the form of the nearest static object, such as a lamp post. Druids at level 9 get treeform, which takes the form of the nearest tree.<P>Making a form such as treeform, which is called animal form and takes the form of the nearest animal (just stick wolf-form faction on these), would be much appreciated. For masters of the outdoors, we sure don't have much in the way of nature spells, beyond renamed nukes and half-hearted attempts at charms.<P>Also, please look at the weight on Vermiculated, it is rediculous.<P>Thank you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Changes/Adjustments i would like to see happen:<P>&gt;Wake of Karana(56spell), banishes rain(as  intended) and doesnt banish the snow, i  realise  that karana is god of rain, but this spell has a  really painfull recast time and regent, seems we  should at least have it work on snow which is  half the zones we play in now with velious  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>&gt;Robe models. currently if a non-robe wearing  class wears a all/all robe it shows up as a  colored seethrough tunic or similar, i think  making robe's all/all and not having them even  look like robes on some races just doesnt work :/<BR> either take of the non-standared races of the  who-can-use list or add those races a new robe  model so it actually shows up when they wear it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>&gt;Faydedar, i maybe the only one that thinks  faydedar as he is now, is the only limiting  factor to every 51+ druid having this sword,  other classes have to kill 3 kunark dragons to  get scales  or the gods etc. He may be elusive  but he is easy to kill in comparisan to these, if  he is changed to a triggered spawn he should be  seriously upgraded in power imo to the level of  kunark dragons, or just leave him as he is....<P>&gt;healing have no problems now if those changes on  test go live  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">, my only breif view made me think  i wont use natures touch at all tho..  (chloroblast is more efficient time and  manawise).. also just a thought, it was our low  alteration cap to cast a 53 spell that caused  fizzles for sup heal, by that theory wont  chloroblast fizzle more than our old superior  heal anyway? (anyone from test feel free to  mention this if it does  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif">)and by that same  logic.. natures touch at 60?(ouch)<BR> Im thinking our alteration cap should be raised   to equal to/or above a paladins  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>52 druid on lanys and 50+ for me has come to a halt. I played 3 druids on 3 different servers to post 50+ to come to halt due to no groups or not needed.  Somebody had a great idea of druid should have a evac or tp to the druids bind point.  That spell would make us a great value to groups.  If wizzies can have a spell to send players back to bind point why cany we have a evac by druid bind point. The wolf form being KOS to everywhere in kunark and velious has to be removed or changed.  Would love some sort of wolf form or close to for inside dungeons.  Evacs for skyfire and EJ should be from any dungeons or some other place then kunark ones.  Velious druid ports need to be alittle safer ( zoned in 3 times to die 3 times not cool). As for healing not going to get into that mess as other have explained very well what needs to be done. Faydedar has to a triggered spawn he is just rediculous to camp.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OK - some of you people are just simply funny in what you want for druids!<P>I AM A 59 DRUID, AND HAVE ALWAYS PLAYED IT WAS PRIMARY.  With over 110 DAYS of play-time on my druid I think I can consider myself an expert.  I have NO trouble finding a group - even in dungeons.  Heck we can do the following:<P>- Buff<BR>- Damage Shield<BR>- Nuke<BR>- Heal<BR>- Crowd Control (no, you DON'T need an enchanter)<BR>- Group HP Regeneration<BR>- Teleport<P>The power of druids lies in their versility.  As a druid, you must rethink your role in a group every time you get new spells - you must rethink how you play your character.<P>The problem with druids is that there are so many DORKS, yes DORKS, that play this class.  Most don't understand mob agro, not to EVEN mention when to heal or when to nuke.  These DORKS give druids a bad name.  Heck, nothing more impressive than having your WHOLE group ALIVE a the end of an uber battle while all the others are dead!<P>****** In fact, ROOT/DOT is a more efficient solo than QUAD KITING - thanks info. ******<P>People that say druids are useless on raids are just not....creative enough.  Heck, with a bard in my group I can keep me, bard, and 4 rogues healed - even fizzling Superior Heal on average of once every 3 casts of at level 59.<P>Druids are the master of VERSATILITY.  I don't wanna be the best nuker.  I don't wanna be the best healer.  I don't wanna be the best buffer.  I WANT, AND AM, THE MASTER OF VERSATILITY.<P>Also, THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH OUR ARMOR - VERMICULATED, ES, OR SoV!!!.  Heck, I can get my AC to 870 without even trying too hard - 870, for a leather based class!  IT SHOULD BE HEAVY!  Can you say STRENGHT BUFF?<P>In my mind, only 2 things need to be fixed:<BR>1.) EPIC - Faydedar - nothing like waiting hours upon hours for an UBER rare DRAGON to spawn, then having your guild/friends make a mad scramble to get there, just to have some DORK train Faydedar into the Iksar Master because they see your guild forming and they want the next epic (has happened 2 times on my server so far.)  Killing a level 55 dragon is trivial - almost as trivial as killing Ragefire.  Make this a triggered spawn, but not just Faydedar.  Faydedar (like the dragon in CS) can be killed with 12 poeple - hardly epic.  Something along the lines of the cleric UBER melee than RAGEFIRE dragon spawn would be a good trigger.  Make the trigger be the quest scimitar we get for the VS stone.  If you lose the fight, you must start over again on this part - much like the clerics having to start over.<P>2.) Reduced fizzle on Superior Heal.<P>That's all that is needed.<P>Our buffs are good.<P>Our nukes are good.<P>Our heals are good.<P>Heck, I like nothing more than being able to DROP THE BOMB on that raid-mob and kill it because the wizards are either out of mana or dead.<P>Quit whining people.  We are ALMOST a perfect class, compared to the others, as we stand.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

And I like the idea f another form of SOW, maybe like and upgrade. Also I would think Druids would Rock if they had a Form of Bear spell, it would be like the wolf form but your a Bear, or maybe a Lion form. Like with the Bear form you would get a BIG BIG str boost and stamina boost. And same with Lion form. Although I think im rambling on now. But that would be pretty cool. Also I think druids should get a lot more DD spells.,,, Yeah  just reached lvl 19 last DD till lvl 40+. Anyways I also think that they should have better pet spells, I mean animals are are friends, they should be in lines to be our pets.

As a jack-of-all-trades we are the best all around class in the game. We heal, buff, nuke with equal abandon. The problem is this, we can do it, but we suck at it compared with whomever is supposed to do it. Clerics heal better, enchanters buff better, mages and wizards nuke better. This is fine and I see the wisdom of this in VI's Vision(tm). Where the problem comes in is efficency. It's better to build a perfect group then hobbling one together with a druid to fill in the gaps.<P>I have been passed over on many raids while the cleric, mage, necro, tank, enchanter next to me is begged to go... I find this disheartening as I put 8 months into playing my druid, a great character I've had a TON of fun with, until I've reached the pinacle of EQ gaming: planar raids.<P>I have racked my brain and read most of these posts to see where this discussion is going. There is no denying that the druid class is passed over for raids, as it is more efficent to have one of the other classes along. We Druids need some talent, skill, or gimmick to make us more useful to a high-level party. Either that or we need to change the perception of what talents are needed in high-level raids. <P>I think we need to increase or viability as a backup to others in a group is key. Our healing abilities have been changed on test so we fizzle less and are more efficent. Now we need to work on our nukes. I don't feel we need new nukes or alter their mana cost, I just feel the fizzle rates and resistances should be looked at.<P>I was in the dreadlands with a group happily killing things, but on blue mobs i was getting resisted about 50% of the time with my firestrike spell. This *REALLY* stinks. I was also fizzling snare about 10% of the time... and my skills are maxed... I almost put my head through the wall!<P>Some additional group spells would be nice, many good ideas have been posted. I'm not going over them again... Ths would help some, but I dont want to become too powerful. I want equal standing on a raid with everyone else (except clerics and enchanters...)<P>The subject of indoor harmony has been brought up and slammed by our self-elected moderator(who I didn't vote for). I think one of our class-based abilites, that we do par excellance is pulling. I remember in outdoor zones groups would beg me to pull for them to break a tough camp. I feel with indoor harmony we would take this ability back.<P>I have died countless times trying to solo with harmony, it has a failure rate that is just enough so we need a good group to back us up on tough spawns, when we bring 1/2 the camp on us. I also do not belive tis will increase our solo ability as all our kiting spells work outside only! But this will really even things out when a group needs a Druid to break a nasty camp.<P>No changes need to be made to the spell, other than upping it's level quite a bit, increasing the mana cost, and having it work indoors. If this isn't enough, then there is always reagents. So when that fear/hate group is looking for people, we have an equal chance of selection.<P>On the subject of animal charm. I think we should have the spells removed. From a logical point-of-view, as previous posters have mentioned, that the animal should gladly want to help us kill the nasty mob, then happily run of and frolic in the fields once the charm is over...<P>But as a game balance issue I don't want to charm a griff and use it to smash other griffs... without fear of repercussions. It is simply WAY to powerful. So if it's broke, but balanced, I don't think we should have it at all. <P>To recap:<P>Druids need to become more viable as members of a raiding group. This makes sense as VI wants to encourage grouping. Here are suggestions I have seen that look like they'd work.<BR>   * more efficent healing<BR>   * slightly better results when nuking (less resists and fizzles)<BR>   * indoor harmony<BR>   * remove charm animal line<BR>   * additional group buffs (just a combo heat/cold resist in one would be just ducky, but others want more...)<P>I also wish to thank Absor for letting us discuss this, and taking the time to sort through this mess.<P>Taujamb Stinkfoot<BR>46th Druid on Elrosi Marr<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>-Ainianu-, I was not responding to you or I would have used your name, like I just did   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif">  So, I type in caps - it's my personality - it draws attention to important things.<P>The point of THIS TALK is to discuss balance.  While many of the ideas are nice, there is no way that VI will put them in now.  My points where simple - a druid properly played is a complete class - even 50+.  The key word there being _properly_.  Many dorks play our class - and the few bad apples spoil the whole barrol.<P>VI understand the druid and how many dorks play it every day.  Look at our Epic.  There are 6 mobs that the druid cannot solo.  Druids who have been anti-social will never be able to get thier epics.  VI rewards social (i.e. grouping) druids in this way.  They just need to make Faydedar a triggered spawn  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P><BR>Also, one final note -Ainianu-, attacking then apologizing for the attack afterwords tends to make one question your sincerity.

</FONT><HR>I've been playing a half-elf druid as my prime character since the game came out and I've read through this entire string.  Important "balance" issues are:<P>1. Fizzles - Get rid of them, you're killing not just the druids, but everyone in their group.<P>2. Heals - Think you are going in the right direction with this.  I do like the "quick heal" concept that heals someone just enough for them to hold out until the big heal comes around.  won't do any good if theirs a big fizzle rate on it.<P>3. Druid Specific Ability - I'm intrigued by the ideas that not only give the druids a more specific role in a group, but enhance & tie into the druids "nature" roleplay.  The group elemental resist line mentioned by some is especially intriging if it doesn't step on the toes of other classes, and it makes great sense from a roleplay perspective.<P>4. Charm Animals.  Please reconsider the fairness of basing any fix for "charming" animals on the charisma attribute, when druids have been given  no reason to work on charisma at any point in their characters in development since the game came out.  Consider using the prime attribute for the class, wisdom, or add animal charm as a class specific skill to be worked on like any other skill.  (Hint, add quests for moving up to the next level or type of animal.  But please don't make it "Kill level 50 Bambi for a level 25 pet kind of quest)<P>5. Forms - It is a balance issue when a nature-centric class is so limited in forms.  The wolf line needs variety, I've always wanted treant form, and griffon form or group griffon form would just be plain fun.  <P>6. Ports - If you want to "balance" the game for everyone, please add them. I don't mind the limited risk of having to zone in "hot" like we do when porting to Iceclad if that's what its going to take to get them.  Don't make it one-shot lethal to the prepared though.  <P>7. Variety & Quests - Like forms, it IS a balance issue.  Lets not sweep it under the rug, it's not going away.<P>Thanks again for the forum, and btw, Velious has been particularly encouraging for this druid, I look forward to whatever enhancements await.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have a few ideas and solutions to problems of druidic balance, I'm a 54 halfling druid of Karana, on the Fennin Ro server, in a non-uber guild.<P>1. Mana regen: People have proposed to increase it, but w/ current spells there's no way to do so without increasing druid's solo power as well, and druid solo power is good enough (probably too good) as is.  Instead of a SINGLE TARGET or SELF-ONLY spell, make it a GROUP BUFF, like circle of winter/summer, but make it regen 1 mana/hp for EVERY EXTRA PERSON besides yourself in group.  So, for example, if you had 6 people in your group, you cast the spell, and everybody will regen 5 mana/hp per tick, stacks w/ everything.  2 mana/hp w/ 2 people, 4 w/ 3, etc.  This would go a long way in increasing the desirability of druids in groups, and would be totally useless solo.  Make it lvl 44 w/ an upgrade at 55, times when druids start to have serious desirability problems in groups.<P>2. Teleports: frankly not really a balancing issue, saving 10 minutes to run from nk to halas isn't that big of a deal...no need to teleport to kelethin either, druids can teleport to nk and train right at the ring, and butcherblock's only 2 zones away.<P>3. Heals: changes on test are good enough, we're not meant to be clerics, just good enough to make an APPRECIABLE difference in a group so people will invite us  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>4. Charms: DO NOT in any case upgrade this line of spells, druids should not be necros/mages w/ reliable pets, if animal charms are upgraded, druid solo power would explode exponentially (imagine kiting a mob w/ a reliable pet buffed w/ savage spirit hitting it from behind...we'd be better soloers than necros)<P>5. Equipment: certainly a concern, but as someone who's still wearing a mithril runed tunic at lvl 54, I'm willing to accept it as a trade-off to my well-rounded abilities, although a mid-30s set of quest armor (similar to totemic stats perhaps...but green chain look) would go a long way to help druids.  <P>6. Raids: I never had a problem getting in a raid ran by a friendly guild...think about the plight of melees, no raid leader ever went "oh we must have 3 more paladins or we'll never take down this guy!", being a social game, people get in/out raids based on their behavior and demonstrated ability as much as their class, I recommend encouraging grouping w/ the people you want to raid w/ first instead of doing anything drastic to upgrade our raiding ability.  The healing upgrades are plenty enough...though I can always hope for a ice/magic based indoor castable nuke at 55+ (I know there's frost, but drop rates are quite low)<P>7. Grouping in Dungeons: in places like kc and os, druids have a harder time finding groups, shamans are prefered for the same healing, inferior nuking but superior doting, and debuffs (very important, since enchanters are so fragile, any extra aggro shared is extremely helpful)  Buffing makes a difference, but not an APPRECIABLE one, i.e. you'll never win or lose a fight because you didn't get buffed by a shaman...you will win or lose fights based on whether you slowed the mob/landed the nuke/saved the enchanter's life.  Druids, being diverse, has no unique APPRECIABLE contributions to the group besides snaring, but that's shared by wizards, rangers, and necros.  However, with the addition of a few unique buffs, like group-only mana/hp regen, group upgraded wolf form (not too upgraded, the 44 form of the great wolf at 55 would be good, its attack buffs are similar to ranger call of the predator) that's castable indoors WITHOUT the speed factor, or best yet, allowing druid skin line to stack w/ cleric resolution line.  Shaman's talisman line does much the same +hp effect, and stacks, a hp buff that gives less hp than cleric buffs for two to three times the mana and only on single targets is not going to be a great help on raids.  However, for single exp groups, this would help druids find a role.  Since the stacking is EXTRA, it would not step on shaman toes, druids still don't buff dex/agi/sta, or str nearly as well, still can't slow, still can't malo, still can't dot as well, still doesn't have free (kunark bracer) nukes.  <P>8. Specific spells: Legacy of Spike: works perfectly fine as is, it's supposed to do less than normal damage shield because it's group, which means higher mana efficiency, and you can easily tell when it wears off.  Egress/Succor: clearing aggro would truly make these spells evacuate spells, otherwise when fighting high lvl mobs, you just get summoned back and killed anyways, as is, these spells are nothing but shortcuts to go through a zone (think siren's grotto).  Pet: only good for novelty value in raids or exp groups, which is fine, druids aren't meant to be even a secondary pet class.  <P>9. Quad kiting: change itor not, it doesn't affect druids post 50s much anymore, too dangerous to quad kite anywhere after maybe 45 or so, reducing range on aoe dd spells by maybe 25% would effectively stop the rare as it is practice altogether.  <P>10. Epic: hard to get vs on my server due to the "race for it" mentality right after it spawns, but he spawns often enough (and stays spawned) to produce enough gems.  Faydedar's spawn pattern is, however, less perfect.  Adding a triggered mob (think General for rogue epic, most of the cleric epic mobs, monk epic mobs) that's harder than Faydedar but doesn't despawn would solve the problem.  Make it a risky fight like the General, hand in elaborate scimitar and spawn Radedyfa, 60 magic immune dragon in somewhere easily accesible but deserted, maybe bw like the final cleric epic mob, but make it not path so it doesn't slaughter the zone or die to an npc (telin darkforest comes to mind...)<P>Thanks for reading this far down, I apologize for the lengthy post.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I've just recently achieved the level of 50.  I love nearly everything about being a druid.  I roleplay the druid to what it is supposed to be, a keeper of nature.  I've been playing for quite some time now, taking my time throughout the levels and such.  I've become a master at 6 trade skills and done literally any quest I come upon...Granted few to none druid  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  There are a few little play aspects I'd love to see though.<P>1.  Quests.  Armor, items, toys, who cares.  Just druid quests.<P>2.  (My Favorite Idea)  The one thing I desire more than anything is to get level 55 to have a pet.  Granted the pet is weak beyond all status, but I adore the idea of having a little bear pet.  I have several thoughts here.  First is having a skill obtainable at level 45ish.  This skill is like any skill ie..forage/picklocks/pickpocket.  It'd have to be trained.  Depending on skill level, one could charm an animal of indifferent faction or higher.  Heck, it'd be awesome to run across the eastern wastes with even a snow bunny friend trailing behind  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  They'd be your friend until death or zone.  Even if it is very limited in power it'd be a really interesting quality for the roleplay aspects.  Or Second, move nature walker's behest to a level where it is useful besides being a companion.<P>3.  The Look.  Everyone in EQ knows equipment chosen is 60% look, 30% stats, 10% status.  The best looking pieces for druids contain no wisdom increasing qualities.  Some of the best wisdom pieces are usable by warrios and bards, but not druids?<P>4.  Healing.  This one has been run into the ground in the previous threads, but I'll help to pound it in a little more.<P>5.  I REALLY like the imbued leathers and have been working my tail off (pun intended) to create them.  But they're just inadecuate.  There are only two pieces I have used, boots and belt.  Only other I'd consider is the arms.  Enchant Leather for enchanters or druids?<P>That's about all the enhancments I could see happening that wouldn't effect the overall power of a druid.<P>Comments on our being "Overpowered"<P>People whine and complain about druids and our power, yet in the same breath will decline to have us in a group.  If we're so overpowered, why aren't we welcomed into groups for that power?  I love grouping, but it's rare, outside my guild, to the point that I am forced to solo most of the time.  Take away the druids effectivness at soloing and you remove 90% of the druids in the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi my thoughts after playing a Druid for 57 levels;<P>1. Specialization: This was brought up at the Fan Faire Magic System meeting. Could Primary Specialization be made to do more? This would help with those uber mobs fights, which go on forever. Could the lesser specializations also increase post fifty like channeling? Say 5 points a level to cap at 100 at level 60.<P>2. Fizzles: This was also brought up at the Fan Faire Magic System meeting. The over all fizzle rate (not just Sup. Healing and Breath of Ro, they are the worst) is very high post 50. I think some thing is broken when it works out all fizzles rates for lower level spells. This needs to be looked at.<P>3. Healing: The new planned changes I have heard about on test sound great. Very nice to see and much needed.<P>4. Egress and Succor: Need to clear the hate list or have more of a chance to clear them. <P>5. Spell Drops: Regrowth of the Grove is too rare a drop. I think there is maybe 2 or 3 on my entire server.<P>6. Pet: The Druid pet is cute (as designed I believe) and is actually good for low greens. It’s around level 24 to 28(as I recall), the only thing I would add is could it be made to be always level 28 (30 would be better) this is given the huge mana cost of it.<P>7. Verm Armor: Is too heavy they should be more in line with other plane armors. Enough said, personal pet peeve.<BR> <BR>8. ES Armor: Would be nice to see Ensnare on ES gloves. No bat wings for ES boots. Given the newer SoV armors may be add some minor stats on the ES pieces that do not have stats might make ES armor be worn more, not just kept in a bag to be swapped out. I know I am coming up on a time where the 2 pieces I wear most often will be put in the bank with the rest of my ES.<P>9. SoV Quest Armor: Please the Leather look is a bad step backwards, even with the new graphics. I for one am not even planning to do them over this. <P>10. Wake of K. (56): 2 Problems one is refresh is so long to make it almost useless and for such a minor effect the mana cost is high.<P>11. Charm plants: The level cap on this spell is too low. Could it either it be raised or a new one added for higher level plants.<BR> <BR>12. Travel: As some one put it in a past post the rut between the druid ruins and the Castle in the DL is so deep I think the mountains might fall. It would be nice to see normal Circle spells for EJ and SF. My personal take on it is making them only castable in RoV. A Druid would then spend the same time medding the mana back as running to the castle.<P>13. Epic: My 2 thoughts are; The Faydedar spawn should be switched to a triggered spawn and the Stones should be moved off of VS or VS should be changed. Why? Other than casting Harmony, which a ranger can do too, Rangers with True Shot are wanted on the raid, Druids are not. A druid is almost useless on a VS raid. Enhancing our value on a raid for our quest mob would be nice to see.<BR> <BR>14. More Forms: A trent from would be nice and the only one I can see. Maybe a mix of regen and mana regen with only walking speed and some stat bonuses. But I see any new forms to be a pipe dream at this point.<P>Druid 57<BR>Bristlebane<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Druids: Masters of Travel<P>Group Levitate<BR>Group Endure Breath<BR>A port in/to every zone that has a "broken" portal<BR>A port in/to any "Forrest type" zone<P>Ok, for the most part, these have been mentioned in some way before in this very lengthy thread, but I am posting other ideas as well, and feel I should add these because I too feel these should be implemented in some way.  Downtime is already crazy due to buff/med time, let us druids do what we are masters of....getting people places AFAP.<P>Druids: One with Nature<P>Animal's in game should be just that, animals.  I cannot believe how many creatures I have tried to cast charm spells on only to find out "This spell only works on Animals".  What I have to suggest is instead of "being able to take any form of creature in zone" or "being able to charm any creature in zone" or any other form of these 2 as have been posted numerous times in various ways is this:  <P>Become one with the animal!  As in, an animal in the zone and you merge into one.  I'm sure VI and their teams can make this veasable with a little programming...get rid of the charm line of spells, and implement something more along the line of this.  Now, I know we can't have a PC take on all the powers of an NPC mob, talk about unbalanced, that's where VI programming comes into play.  Make it so we take on a fraction of there stats, enough to make us formidable, but not overpowering.  Make it so we can only do it to creatures aligned with Tunare/Karana even to further keep it balanced.  This goes for plant type creatures as well.<P>Druids: Jack's of all Trades...Master's of none<P>This is what made me choose a druid in the first place...their versatility.  But unfortunatly, versatility vs. Mastery does not bode well in a grp status if someone else can do what we can do better.  I have 2 proposal's for balancing this:<P>1) Have some 50+ spells that are along the line of current druid spells, but are stackable with other class buffs, made weaker.  For example:  Instead of having either NS or Aego, make an NS type spell weaker, but stack with Aego...enough to make people want us in group for the increase in buff, but not make us overpowering.<P>2)  Give us the some of the buff/heal powers of all other classes, but make it take more mana and longer casting time...this would add to our versatility, and truly define the term given us "Jack of all trades...Master of none". A jack of all trades dabbles in all feilds...meaning since he/she hasn't studied the art to mastery, he/she does not know all the spells..nor is as proficient at the spells he/she has studied.  This would allow us to properly "fill in the gap" of a group that needs a particular class but is not available.<P>  These are merely suggestions on a thread asking for balancing of the druid class of which I am a druid wishing for balance.  I'm not here to say this is what needs to be done to make druids more balanced, nor am I posting this thinking any or all my ideas will be implemented, I'm just trying to share some ideas on a class that for so long has been known as a "solo" class and is now being redefined into a group style class, of which I am all for.<P>Pern Spellblade<BR>Druid under Karana<BR>Member of Numinous on Tarew Marr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If you take a good look at what it is that certain classes bring to high level encounters, it becomes apparent that the key skills and spells that they bring to the table are 'special'.<P>What I mean by this is that all of the desired classes have abilities and spells that are OPEN ENDED.  They are not based purely on a set number of hitpoints (for example).  I'll use Open Ended to describle any spell that has potentially limitelss use.<P>An obvious example of this is the Cleric's Complete Heal spell.  Technically this spell could heal 5 Trillion hitpoints of damage... sure no one will ever have that many hitpoints, but the nature of the spell has no limits.  <P>Other spells/abilities that are open eded (or at least I view them as):  Shaman Slow line of spells, Enchanter's AQ speed spells, Enchater Mes and charm spells, Riposte Discipline, Feign Death, Tashani line of spells... etc...<P>All of these things approach conflicts with the approach of changing the nature of the conflict.  Not merely doing X amount of damage, or healing X amount of hitpoints.  These kinds of abilities are key to making certain classes highly valued.  It is in this area that druids have a shortcoming.<P>True, Druids have several spells that fall under this category:<P> - Thorns<BR> - Charm Animal<BR> - Snare (yes, this is a powerful spell, but too widespread for druids to claim it as a class feature)<BR> - The new line of Ro spells from Velious.<BR> - Harmony<P>I feel that most debuff spells fall under the Open Ended category as well.  The problem is that most of these spells are underpowered (at least for the types of encounters that people are complaining about).  I won't pretend to have any perfect ideas for new druid abilities... sure there are many cool things that are unrealistic for VI to add...  <P>However, I do feel that the Ro line of spells that were added in Velious is a step in the right direction.  Now I can get the crap beat out of me with the best of the Shamans!  Though again, these spells are not quite powerful enough to be useful.<P>Hell, I'll throw out an idea for these kinds of spells (since they actually do seem to be unique to druids):  If a Shaman's slow spell affects a monster speed using a % as opposed to simply subtracting a speed value from the monster's total, why not use a percentage for the Ro line of spells?<P>Currently Fixation of Ro and Ro's Fiery Sundering adjust a creatures's AC, ATK and Fire Resist by a set value... same every time it's cast.  Well, how about having a spell like this that lowers a monster's AC, ATK etc... but based off a percentage?  This would be both useful, open ended and something druids could call their own... Well a useful percentage even =)<P>Okay... Stopping now...<P> - Mel, Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Couple more things....This guy has a great idea.<P>"1. Mana regen: People have proposed to increase it, but w/ current spells there's no way to do so without increasing druid's solo power as well, and druid solo power is good enough (probably too good) as is. Instead of a SINGLE TARGET or SELF-ONLY spell, make it a GROUP BUFF, like circle of winter/summer, but make it regen 1 mana/hp for EVERY EXTRA PERSON besides yourself in group. So, for example, if you had 6 people in your group, you cast the spell, and everybody will regen 5 mana/hp per tick, stacks w/ everything. 2 mana/hp w/ 2 people, 4 w/ 3, etc. This would go a long way in increasing the desirability of druids in groups, and would be totally useless solo. Make it lvl 44 w/ an upgrade at 55, times when druids start to have serious desirability problems in groups."<P>This would be AWESOME.  Not only would it be useless soloing, but it would make druids much more useful in groups.  <P>Druid spells should stack.  I'd like SL(whatever), mana regen (if put in), and also make Thorncoat (line) targetable.  These would make druids MUCH more desirable in groups without changing soloability.<P>To be useful in groups later on u need to be A. The BEST at something.  B.  Stack with the best, or other people buffing.  <P>Make all caster classes after 50 or so auto med, regardless of bodily position.<P>Change 55 Pet spell, Natures Behest, to a lvl 49 spell with the same effect.  Make it buyable at a vendor.  This wouldnt really change the game at all just make druids more fun.  The 6 Level difference is quite a lot, due to all 51+ levels being hell lvls.  Sides, lil' bears r cute ^_^.<P>Switch ES gloves to ensnare.  Arms do a lvl 34 spell, Tunic lvl 44 spell, legs 39 spell, bracer 39 spell, arms and head like a 14 spell heh, but a lvl 1(?!) spell.  Wouldn't hurt that much to change it to ensnare and make it much more useful.<P>And please make quadkiting impossible to do, just to clear out the uber jerks in the druid class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The biggest problem with me and this class is that I CAN NOT GET A GROUP. many druids love soloing, but i love grouping (yes, meeting new people is fun, and not boring just sitting there by yourself, watching that little blue bar go up, slowly....). My rogue friend  told me that there was a good place to hunt, i went there, i could not get a group. He goes there, he's taken in instantly.<P>Biggest problem is that we do not stand out. I'm sure a lot of you say, we do stand out by soloing, but soloing is dead boring. Snoooorree....Last time i grouped, it was from a guild mate, no pick up groups in the last..well, for a while.<P>Give us something big!

</FONT><HR>2 short and simple requests.<P>1)Since the one things druids are best at is travel. Can you make the Ring line of teleport spells targetable. So we dont have to make round trips when porting others. Or make a new line of spells that does this.<P>2)Not really druid specific but everyone would gain from this. Could the be an option to tell us when our Buffs ware off, much like a DoT.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057052-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057052-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057052-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057052-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057052&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057052&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
