</FONT><HR>Class logic.<P>Wizards are a specialty class, much like a Cleric, only they specialize in a different field.<P>I would like to compare the logic between these specialty classes.<P>Cleric is specialized in Healing.<BR>Comparable classes are:<BR>Druid<BR>Shaman<P>These other classes are more diversified so Absor recently stated that he felt that a cleric should be replaceable with 2 of these comparable classes.<BR>Thus needing 2 people to replace his one specialty, healing. I personally agree with this logic.<P>Now lets look at wizards.<BR>Wizard’s specialty is dealing magical damage.<BR>Comparable Classes:<BR>Mage<BR>Necro<BR>Enchanter<BR>Druid<BR>Shaman<BR>Cleric<P>Now lets see if two of these more diversified classes will replace one specialized in dealing magical damage.<P>Two clerics can replace one wizard, if they are not fighting, undead then only one is needed. I think this is balanced.<P>Two shamans can replace one wizard. Balanced<P>One druid can replace a wizard, not balanced.<P>One mage can replace one wizard, with out pet. Not balanced.<P>One Necro can replace a wizard with out pet. Dots are magical damage, though it is not instant this is really irrelevant. Not balanced.<P>One enchanter can replace a wizard with a pet not balanced.<P>This is the clearest way I can show what wizards are upset about. This is why there will be Wizard Talk part XXXV if you do not do something about our class.<P>I think one major mistake VI made is when they gave Clarity to Enchanters and not Wizards. I know this will piss off all of the enchanters but just hear me out.<P>Enchanters will ALWAYS BE NEEDED in a group for their unique ability to control crowds of MOBs.<P>Removing this spell from Enchanters line and placing it in wizards will follow the wizard’s class better in these ways:<BR> <BR>1.Wizards Rely totally on mana. NO PETS<BR>2.Wizards are the best at controlling mana with the best conversion of mana to magical damage.<BR>3.Wizards are best at gathering mana with Harvest.<BR>4.Wizards should be the one class to help other classes in mana efficiency with Clarity.<P>I KNOW this is a HUGE change of thinking, but look at the possible benefits.<P>Wizards Become more group friendly with out taking the group niche away from enchanters. I don’t think that a group in KC will say " OH lets not get the enchanter to control trains, lets get the wizard with clarity." But if there is not an enchanter in the zone, The group looking for help will take the wizard for the clarity, instead of waiting for the chanter and leaving one spot open for him.<P>Tanks careless about Clarity, and will still want an enchanter for the buffs, but maybe the cleric or the other casters might want a wizard. As it stands they are not even considered.<P>Other items to consider when doing a wizard fix are the master seekers of knowledge.<P>Maybe changes to the Identify spell, where you can target mobs and get a reading of their resistances and hp.<P>Adding a spell like Thought Filter:<BR>Divination<BR>Effect gives the surface thoughts of NPCs.<BR>Reason, those NPCs with confusing text for Quest, this spell could give insight into what they need to be told.<P>One last thing. If you are going to make us cast spells in Melee Range we should have melee AC. I do not understand the reasoning for this, also why can non-caster mobs summon you? <P>Well thank you for taking the time to listen to our concerns.<P>I hope you get this far down.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>/em steps forward and clears his throat.<P>Oh my! I did not expect to see changes like the ones mentioned on Caster's Realm implemented so quickly. Bravo Verant!<P>However, did I miss an announcement that says more changes are in the works? Come to think of it, did this get "announced" at all? Please don't take this as a flame, but I got nervous when I saw new spells for Druids, Shamans, Magicians, Paladins, Shadowknights and Rangers, along with a couple of perks for Bards, but no mention of my personal favorite, Wizards. I agree that the changes to rain spells are definitely a plus (thank you) but I'm hoping to see a little bit done for Wizards too.<P>Maybe I'm a little bit jealous seeing that Magicians get a couple of nice pet buffs, thereby increasing their pets abilities which seems to be an area of contention among us "petless" casters. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad to see the Magicians getting improvements. In fact, since I regularly group with a Magician, this is a very good thing, IMHO.<P>It's just that I've just seen a number of really good suggestions fly past on this thread and I hope they're not going to be forgotten. <P>/em looks hopeful.<BR>/em steps back into the crowd of Wizards nervously.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The rain will no longer hit the gnoll embalmer pet.  Why not just make it a single-target 4-wave dd?  That would fix rains.<P>As far as the message goes, I see there are new spells for sale.

</FONT><HR>It doesn't hit PC pets, this doesn't (or shouldn't) apply to the monsters.  However,  using AE Rain on multiple targets is a big mistake, use pillars.  AE Rain is BROKEN as an area effect on more than one target.

The are the most undesirable class to group with (until the 50's). <P>The reason is simply that they are a speciality class that is easily replaced.

</FONT><HR>The way I see it - the problem is not so much class balance, but game design.<P>The fundamental problem is intrinsic in the 6 person group design of EQ.<P>Post 50+, the worth while mobs have to be killed by multiple groups. If it takes 24 persons (4 full groups) to get to, and kill 1 ubber mob, only 6 out of 24 will get experience. If that ubber mob only drops 1 item, only 1 out of 24 will get a reward. And it is likely that 4 out of 24 will die in the attempt - loosing some XP (even with a XP rez which is not 100%)<P>So 24 people spend 3 to 8 hours getting to and fighting an ubber mob - perhaps multiple times, hours wasted on CRs, just so 1 person can get an one item? <P>I miss the days of D&D, when if you killed a dragon there was a chest full of items and everyone got experience and an item or cash.<P>The solution is to increase post 50 groups to 18 or 24.<P>Allow group spells to affect all 24 members in the group. <P>For example, 1 cleric for the same mana cost for buffing 6, now could group buff 24 people. Leaving other clerics use their mana on heals.<P>What this means is that the more people in the group - the more effecient is the mana use. <P>** Thus no need to increase an individual's power and upset balance **<P>Allow other casters to pool their manna to cast "powerful" spells. These spells require several casters linked together because the manna requirements are greater.<P>** Again no need to increase an individual's power and upset balance **<P>For example, 10 Wizards linked together to cast a powerful nuke, which would drop that Ubber mob down 2 bubble per blast.<P>Making this change doesn't reduce the risk or challenge to the game, it only solves the balance problem when confronting the 50+ mobs with out upseting individual balance.<P>Getting 24 people to show up, stay for 3 to 8 hours, organizing them to play certain roles is still a challenge which no game dynamics can improve upon.<P>Now these ideas don't eliminate the need to fix certain abilities and spells. A lot of the issues presented in these posts deal with specific spells - which are still issues.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1) I dont know how is the EQ manual in english, but I have the french version of the manual, and let try to translate what is written on the "wizard description":<BR>"The wizard is in an eternal quest of knowledge, he spend his life to reach this knowledge. He can use powerful spells that allow him to see farther and to moove objects without touching them (telekinesy).<BR>His knowledge lust made of him an expert in offense and in defense"<P>Ok this is not the exact translation, I m not so good in english to translate exactly, sorry, but the idea is there...<BR>So there is a problem...<BR>- Wizard can see farthest: ok with glimpse...<BR>- Wizard can moove objets in distance (telekinesy): no, I never saw that. How about making telekinesy spells, usable on mobs, for example a spell like root, but the wizard would be able to moove the mob?<BR>- Wizard are expert in offense and defense: ok I would say they can nuke quite well (actually they should nuke muche better), so ok for expert in offense, but in defense? There is something wrong...<P>2) If you dont want to give wizard their true power by increasing their nuke, then at least give them something so that they are no more hated in group...<BR>- Wizards are the astral travellers, why not giving them some spells in thise direction? How about an "astral" travel spell, that allow them to fly, be invisible and moove on the walls?<BR>- Wizards are the masters of knowledge... Why not give them an new skill to identify monsters? I mean HP, resistances, atck, defense, damage output, and so on... <BR>- Give them ability to select where they want to go with spells like yonder, shadow step and fade<P>3) I think they are balanced while soloing. The problem is in group... Other class can nuke like wizard and add other benefits, like pets, damage shields, buffs, healing and so on. Actually, in a group, wizard is fighting high mobs, so is getting much resisted. Remoove this resist factor. Wont change their solo hability (they are rarely resisted in solo, because fighting blue or high green mobs), and increase their power in groups...<P>4) If you dont want to balance wizards, just remoove them... So there wont be so longs discussion about balancing classes, no more players complaining about they unseless wizards...<P>5) There are lots of suggestion that I think very good, but I think you can just read them in this forum, so I wont repeat them...<P>35th wizard<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just wondering...how many of us out there have been to places that have these "uber MOBs" there?(meaning Velious for the most part)<P>I'm only asking because we may in a small way be missing the real point here which is to balance the class as best as possiable and to get a bit more "real" i dont think that ever player out there gets to spend the whole day kiling "God-like  creatures", don't misunderstand what i mean, the new MOB's out there are way harder then in the old world(some in Kunark but most in Velious) but we don't log in and start fighting Gods right out,most are groups that hit a place here or there for EXP most of the time,the "Uber MOB" problem is a very tuff one to adress and in a small way is very rare for the larger portion of players out there because of what is needed to get there and the time of the fights that one needs to invest,lets not loose sight of the real problem here whihc we all feel is balance. <P>We Wizards do need some fare upgrades and yes,there are a few folks here that have stated that we do need a fix but mana and more power are the wrong ways to go but im at a bit of a loose to think what else we have to offer unlsee Verant is willing to grap something off another class and give it to us i.e Clarity is one that a few players have brought to light as a trade off of sorts or a new set of spells maybe. I say keep the ideas rolling but think first..What is balance in the eyes of Verant?...if you can figures that out you may be on the road to a better understanding of what there after and may have a few ideas that can work.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>  One problem that concerns all spell casting classes is that of post 50 spell drops.  At the moment, some spells are very rare and as such the cost to buy one of them is very high.  An example of how much money is being asked for spells is Translocate.  Some people are asking for 10kpp for this spell.  Admittedly, most people are not going to buy at that price, but it is shocking that the spell should be rare enough that people would even consider paying it at all.<BR>  Perhaps someone could explain to me why so many of our spells are drop only?  This is for all casters, not just wizards.  To an certain extent I can understand the logic of it, but Velious destroyed what little acceptance I had of the issue.  In Velious melee classes gained disciplines.  Now I do not know much about the melee aspect of the high level game having never played a character there, but I did ask some friends who have and they said that melee classes gain the ability to use their new disciplines as soon as they are high enough level.  Huh?  How is that possible?  Why are spell casters required to hunt or buy rare drop only spells when melee classes are given their skill improvements?  If melee classes had to find drop only tomes of each discipline, then I could grudging accept drop only spells.  But to have melee classes “mystically” learn their new skills while spell casters have to hunt for their new spells just isn’t right.  At least I think so.<BR>  To correct this problem you have four options.  One.  Make melee characters search for tomes that have to be handed in to their trainer to learn their new discipline.  Two.  Greatly increase the spell drops.  Three.  Put the spells on vendors.  The cost of the spells could be high.  Perhaps 100pp per level after 50, but if we had somewhere we could buy the spells if we were willing to pay the price, then you would not have much cause for complaint.  Four.  Make all drop spells questable.<BR>  For questable spells they quests should require rare drops of off common mobs for you level.  For example, for Pillars of Frost should have quest components that drop off of creatures like Spirocs in Timorous Deep.  The components should then be turned into your trainer to get your new spell.  This method would allow you to not only work at gaining your level, but it would also provide you with the opportunity to acquire the components necessary for the spells for your next level.  The spell at the end, and most likely the components themselves, would be no drop.  That way the players would have to hunt for the components themselves unless they wanted to buy a dropped version of the spell. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor;<P>Hopefully you're still reading at this point.<P>You wonder why we get upset, and figure nothing<BR>is going to change? Look at test right now to understand why. We're the single class most hurting in terms of getting groups and exp (I'm level 55, and I can honestly say that OVER 80 percent of my experience since 42 has come either solo, or in a group with one other wizard.) And EVEN THOUGH we're in dire need of work, huge bennies are given to: Druids, Shamans, Paladins, Shadowknights, Rangers, Bards, and Warrior ALL just got a bunch of improvements on test! What about US?<P>Yes, I know there are 13 different classes, and someone has to go last, but how about making those that are in the LEAST need wait?? You say that emails are flying around the office about wizards - are we that much harder to fix than other classes? We've given you a LOT of VERY good ideas, and numerous approaches to those ideas. <P>Then on the Epic, you say "They're not all going to be of exactly equal difficulty." I don't think anyone is asking for that, just for ROUGHLY equal. On Bristlebane, we've killed Cazic five times for one wizard's attempt at his epic, and it has YET to drop. <P>All we want, Absor is:<P>To be as wanted in both XP and Big Game groups <BR>as Clerics or Enchanters, no matter WHICH continent we're on, and an Epic that is of ROUGLY the same difficulty to obtain as everyone elses, not so hard that the best rate we even HOPE to see them completed is 1 a week, with the reality being less than 1/month/server. If this IS the goal for epics, then make them ALL comply.<P>You say "Have some faith, give us some credit." We have.. with the result being that we spend two weeks on wild goose chases for spell vendors that aren't even IN GAME because the people we're supposed to 'have some faith' in couldn't be bothered to confirm the existance of the vendor AND that the spells were present. How's that supposed to make us view Verant's staff?<P>Minor or trivial? Perhaps. But it gave the druids an improvement over wizards, which they should have.<P>Thrankul Stormraven<BR>Level 55 Wizard, Bristlebane.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>EbanSDG_Xev, what i meant about the "uber MOB's" was in response to the idea of balance and that maybe a few persons out there weren't seeing that,i do agree that the Velious MOB's are a bit high on the HP's and the Ubers out there are REALLY nutts but what Absor is looking for i think is ways to make us better over all not just to a few choise creatures or in a few special fights, as for the inefficency issuse were still a force to be reckoned with but not as much as most of us here would like(me included). As for the solo issuse i have to say ive been able to and still am at times doing just that,sure it takes a few SOW potions and a bit of work but its not THAT hard and I'll tell ya there are many Druids that would kill to have the vast array of spells I have when it comes down to soloing, there is no class out there that gets the same range of spells that we do(the Mageician is the only one i can think of that comes close).<P>Aramalg, you were asking why some of our spells are "drop only" i think it was Gorden or maybe Absor who said it was in response to players getting frustrated with research and all the runes,pages,words and parts needed to make them so the "drop only" spell idea was there solution to the problem.<P>We Wizards are a bit unique in our own way when it comes to the things we can do but there is too fine a line I think between us and a few classes out there that were sort of a blur in the eyes of most players, we need something to set us apart  from all the rest if were to be more "group friendly" i just hope Verant with our help can do just that.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The real Goal I think is to make Wizards an asset to groups. Enchanters get Mez and clarity by thier early 30's and what do us Wizzies get?..A snare-You guys are practically making us solo at that lvl-(hence the snare). If you want to help us to be groupable, give us something groups can use!  I agree, fast damage is totally useless to a group- The only thing fast damage is good for is SOLOING! What we need is Either a good STACKABLE damage shield that we can cast on tanks (I dont think this is too much to ask-everyone gets to cast something on their party members except a wiz-unless you actually count that worthless excuse for a buff, O'Kiels Radiation-what a joke) OR - Like has been said already - Create a mob that can ONLY be killed with magic. This however will present the problem that only casters will want to kill it and we all know what happens to casters with no pet and no tank. I'm not asking for a pet or more mana- I'm asking to actually be able to contribute to a group.<P>Thanks for listening.<P>       Hass<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is the third time I've posted this, but it is the first time I've posted it in the right place. Sorry if you've seen it before.<P>Absor,<P>After reading through all the posts on Wizard balance issues I have a few thoughts I’d like to share with you that I hope might be of some help.<P>The balance issues around the Wizard class revolve around one thing. Wizards are a one dimensional class with no defining aspect. This implies that wizards have been unbalanced from day one. Allow me to explain.<P>A wizard nukes, that is it. An argument can be made that we can also have a second dimension in teleportation, but if you consider the amount of time we spend nuking and the amount of time we spend porting it is obvious that the ports are not a defining aspect of the class, they are just a traveling convenience that we share with Druids. Ports just bring us to where we want to nuke.<P>Being a one dimensional nuker is not necessarily a bad thing. This can and should be our defining aspect but it is not. The problem is that many other classes can nuke nearly as well as Wizards taking away the unique aspect of the class. Additionally these other classes have other skills and spells that can contribute to a group. At level 29 Clerics get Wrath, a 200 point nuke for 145 mana and Wizards get Inferno Shock a 240 point nuke for 135 mana. The difference between 40 points of damage and 10 points of mana is insignificant when mana points are measured in the hundreds and hit points are measured in the thousands. This is a cleric! They are not even supposed to be an offensive class and yet they can nuke almost as well as a Wizard! Now throw in Mages and Druids. My point is that Wizards may be the “Masters of Direct Damage” but the advantages Wizards have in this area do not outweigh the benefits of a class that can nuke and heal and SOW and cast damage shields and use pets… This is one of the reasons there are so many Druids, and Mages as a class they are very versatile. Wizards are not versatile.<P>How can this be fixed? It is not easy, I understand why Verant cannot just give us more mana or increase the damage of our spells because that would unbalance the game in the other direction. I believe versatility is the way to go. Add more abilities to make Wizards more attractive, and allow them to contribute passively, like pets and damage shields do. Unfortunately this will require new spells there is no other way. Below are my suggestions…<P>1.	Kill the Al’Kabor line of spells (They are broken and NOBODY uses them) and replace with an Enchant Weapon line of spells. These spells would allow the Wizard to increase the damage of a weapon. This is the flip side of the damage shield coin and I think it blends very well with the Wizards offensive nature. Tanks are a Wizards best friend, about time we returned the favor.<BR>2.	Wizards are the “Master of Magic” right? Well how about a magic debuff that wizards can cast on a mob that will prevent it from casting? If cast on a mob all spells cast by that mob will be immediately interrupted. This spell should not last a long time and should have a fairly expensive mana cost. But I think it is a great idea! This spell would not stun the mob it would still be able to melee just not cast for a few seconds. This would increase the demand for Wizards on raids considerably.<P>These two ideas do not make Wizards over powerful and cannot effectively be used to solo but they add a new dimension to the class that will make Wizards more attractive to groups. The magic debuff does give Wizards a certain advantage over other casters in a duel but they have pets or are much better at melee then us anyway.<P>I hope you consider these ideas and if not the specific suggestions at least take away the general idea. To balance the Wizard we do not need to add more nukes and more mana, we need to add more versatility.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>So.. No responses to the thread for a while and we get balancing changes on the test server. Nothing for wizards there. Is that it? They sure were quick to give druids big heals. I guess they needed to be included in the melee/heal part of the game. If this is all they are going to address about balance, wizards are now even less desired in groups since groups can now go for the class that evacs/nukes and also heals almost like a cleric.<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/mad.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Even Iceclad and Great divide are dangerous at their levels.. see a pattern?<P><BR>Ae spells..<P>another useless line of spells pre 50, unless you want to commit suicide and irritate your group.<P><BR>Concussion..<P>Completely unobtainable by any wizard that is not 50+ or who does not have commitment by groups of 50+ level pc's.<P><BR>Cazic gate..<P>Useless until 15 levels later.. gee how many times has this been brought up?<P><BR>Forse strike, and shock..<P>Unless you have enough mana for 3 attempts to these spells forget it.  dont rely on them to interrupt your opponent either because a resisted spell just doesnt do a very good job interrupting your opponent..<P><BR>The root line of spells..<P>Resisted numerous times, but that isnt quite as bad as how unreliable they seem to be..<P><BR>Okeils Flickering Flame?<P>Oh thanks verant, nothing like being the only class who got a bag of rocks for christmas..<P><BR>Rain type spells..<P>another useless, costly, and resisted line of spells..<P><BR>Invisibility to Undead..<P>Are there any level 39 wizards who have this spell?  If so I can bet it was sold to you by some 50+ char.<P>I could go on and on listing other wizard spells that seem to have no use.  about the only thing going for us wizards are dd's and mainland ports.. well WHOOPDEDOO<P>Wizards are my favorite type of char in any RPG.

</FONT><HR> I like the idea of rain spells. How about giving us a rain spell with like 40 pulses of low damage. <P>This will allow our damage to be done over time and also allow for us to med while the damage is still hitting. It will keep our taunt lower also. It will be kind of like a DoT but has a chance of getting resisted each wave.<P>This would make wizards more effective against those uber mobs without making us over powerful I think.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Being a 52nd lvl wiz I sorta know what I am talking about.  We are NOT the masters of damage and don't even come close at higher levels.  Yes we might of been when we were pre 20's in that perfect situation.  Can anyone tell me what happens to the wiz when they try to be the masters of damage?  THEY DIE FAST   Now that I am hunting in the higher level dungeons and Velious I find that we (wiz) are masters of nothing except taxi service.  A good rogue can dish out more damage during the casting time for our spells than our spell do.  If we try to chain cast and get any exp then we have to sit out the next 3 pulls to med up and we still rarely ever get the exp.  Our guild tried an experiment recently.  We got a group of all wiz and a second group of all war/rog  a few clerics to heal but not in groups.  The wiz group NEVER once got the kill and exp.  We were out of mana half way through the fight and had to watch as the other group had all the fun.  I really enjoy playing a wiz but if it was not for being in a guild who let me come along I think I would of quit that chr a long time ago.  We need either much larger mana pool or reduced mana cost for spells.  And one more important thing that really needs to be fixed is the HP of the target does NOT update very accurately if you are standing back and casting.  It shows the mob as being half health and I start casting and before the spell goes off the mob is dead and I have wasted even more mana.  I sat and watched another player (fighter) as I was standing back in my casting position and noticed his mob health bar was MUCH lower than mine reported because he was much closer to the mob.  <P>   Pre 40-45 yes we wizards rock but after that we are nothing but glorified taxi's who are masters of NOTHING.  A mage and his pet can out damage us with NO problems,  A rogue out damages us.  A fighter with a uber weapon that procs 1k+ does more damage than we could ever hope to do.  Why did the vision (tm) for wizards stop at mid levels????  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The changes so far for other classes have been very much in the right direction, but what you have to remember is that:<P>Wizards really only nuke.<BR>Changing the way we nuke is hard.<P>Give the team a chance to sit down and think up a solution.

</FONT><HR>There are very few times when a wizard is viewed as a good addition to a group. Unlikely other classes which can contribute to the group with some classes being sought almost every time. The fact that the class is not balanced is clear. Just in very rare ocasions a wizard is accepted by a group. Other classes have much less trouble looking for groups. <P>Not being group friendly, it's true wizards contribute poorly to the group efficiency most of the time, is a consequence of the the unbalance. Wizards were made very mana dependant, to be of use a wizard must have mana. But mana spells even mana drain were given to enchanters which were already insanely group friendly not because of Clarity but because of crowd control. It's terrible to stay most of the encounters just sitting and meditating.<P>I think it was a flaw in the project giving mana spells to enchanters instead of wizards. Increasing the wizard's mana regen, firepower or mana efficiency will make them more capable of soloing but it will not make them more group friendly. This increase can have nasty consequences as suddenly making the wizard the best soloing class in the game (I doubt it wizards do not have pets). I personally think making them more group friendly would make everyone more happier. <P>For that reason I can make some suggestions:<BR>-- increased mana regen post certain level as a skill. Perhaps the same effect as not requiring to sit to meditate. Meditating will regain more mana though.<P>-- a zero cost mana drain spell with very low draining capacity for always making wizards do something in a battle. This will replace medding during battles which is not very fun for the player and will be more acceptable by the group as will show the wizard doing something.<P>-- increase spell damage by adding wizards level to the damage. This will make wizards able to cast more low level and more mana efficient spells during battles and actually contribute more instead of just being sat and watching the fight, which is very very boring. A 1st level spell will do 67 damage for 7 mana at level 60th. Of course this wouldn't overpower the class and it will perhaps still be more efficient if a 1600 dmg spell is cast and some time is spent medding than casting 25 spells of 1st level. This will just add an option for player to act more dynamically.<P>-- group harverst.<P>-- AoE and PB roots which will add limited crowd control ability to wizards. Foes will still be able to attack nearby PCs and cast spells.<P>-- life cast: a skill used in desperate situations. wizards will be able to use HP instead of mana to cast spells, very nice to evac. (always keeping a bubble of mana to evac is terrible)<P>-- increased self harvest at higher levels.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 9 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;7&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053715&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053715&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
