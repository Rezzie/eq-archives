</FONT><HR>I guess I fall into the minority of clerics that don't have a problem with others being able to heal.  It would be a welcome relief when I'm oom and the group is getting hit, that someone else can throw in a heal or two until I get the mana up for a complete heal.<P>That being said, I would like to see the cleric class upgraded with a few more things to make it more fun to play.<P>A self only dmg shield would be nice.  As we all know, heal is the best taunt spell in the game. Would be nice to dish out a little damage on the mob until the group tank can get if off of me.<P>Another player suggested a spell similar to dmf that would combine it with sow so that clerics could make the long runs to rez people.  There seem to be alot more requests these days to travel over many zones to rez folks.  That is part of the reason a lot of clerics run anon.<P>Neither of those changes would unbalance the game or class, but would sure add some fun to the cleric character and maybe attract a few more peeps to create one.<P>GreinKnight<BR>46 Cleric (Erudite no less)<BR>The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

(Well, if it is properly tested anyway).<P>I totally support clerics getting anything and everything they need to make their class more playable.  This is part of the problem.  Not enough people choose to play clerics, so there is a shortage at the high levels.<P>So clerics post your hearts out in your class thread and make sure that Absor get through his sometimes thick-skull that you guys need something to encourage more people to make clerics!

</FONT><HR>Yes dragonace, thats all we need, clerics like like GreinKnight (level 46) who can't even mem the spells yet to see how they are used.  Oh yeah, and of course totally ignore/refute/twist words of people who have used the spells since and early expansion.<P>"I totally support clerics getting anything and everything they need to make their class more playable. This is part of the problem. Not enough people choose to play clerics, so there is a shortage at the high levels."<P>Can you tell me why there's a shortage of clerics?  Could it be perhaps this is why others want healing?  If thats the case, fix clerics, not the other classes --Verant has already said they won't do anything for the class and considered us balanced both Abashi and Absor said it.  Hell Absor isn't even reading the posts anymore he's 'skimming' (yeah right!).  Hell since RoK we can't even get them to look over why a single target Marzin buff takes the same component as a single target Naltron *shrug*<P>Just the same old Abashi comments over and over keep ringing in cleric's heads "Clerics can heal therefore they are balanced"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

How about throwing a dot on it so if it does gate there might be a chance the dot kills it ?<P>"because clerics are the only healers who can save the say when a member dies?"<P>*shrug* depends on group any class when used right can save a group not just any healer.<P>"because one cleric can buff better than the other healers put together?"<P>Buff better ?  I beg to differ:<P>Cleric can ONLY buff HP/AC, the only stat buff we can do is STR of 5 with a chance to heal a tiny amount when the person is very low health (near death) which costs a pearl (5-6pp)<P>Now you take into account the HP/AC buffs of druids, as well as shamans and the stat buffs involved.<P>Cleric:<BR>-Heroism, 400hp, 20 ac (putting this in to compare with PoTG)<BR>-Marzin, 700hp, costs a peridot<BR>-Bulwark of faith, 38 ac<BR>The combo spell Aegolism 1100 HPs, 54 AC (yes actually LESS than the individual spells), no other effects, costs a peridot, approx 11pp.<BR>-only other buff we get is an str buff that has a chance of healing about 100ish hps when someone is near death (so minimal if it ever does that you can't notice it, and the fact that it never goes off, I wont even talk about the level 60 version).  5ish str, costs a pearl, about 5-6pp.<P>Druid:<BR>-Protection of the glades, group buff<BR>about 450ish, 24 ac, effect of mana regeneration, no component needed.  Costs more mana than group heroism but blows it away in hps, ac and the mana regen effect.  This buff is far superior.<BR>-Girdle of Karana, gives about 42ish str if I recall vs the cleric 5str which costs a peridot.<P><BR>Shaman:<BR>I'll just go into a few of their best buffs<P>Focus:  Gives approx 400 ish HPs and about 60ish str/dex.<BR>Rit health:  Gives about 50 stamina which increases hps approx 100-150ish I don't know the exact number I'm going by experience with our raids.  This stacks with focus<BR>Celerity:  Haste of about 50%<BR>(I could list an arsenal of buffs here).<P>Comparison:  Cleric Aegolism 1100 hp 54 ac<BR>Druid:  450hp, 24 ac for PoTG<BR>Shaman: 400hp, + (100-150) + X ac = 950-1000ish hps, 24 ac.  This doesn't take into account any further buffs from shammies.  A shammie could easily add various stat buffs to make this closer in the AC department (agi).  Also not shown is the added attack and other benefits of the stat buffs from shamans.<P>Hell I could go on and add to the list of buffs, already you have a very close if not equal of a clerics best buffs all distributed to a druid/shamie.  BUT you also have all the added benefits of mana regeneration, stat buffs useful for combat, str, dex, atk, haste, etc.  And hell, those buffs didn't cost the druid or shaman a lickin cp.<P>*shrug* who wouldn't want the druid/shaman buffs over a cleric ?  Hell I'm a cleric and I'd take them any day.  Still gonna say a cleric can buff better than the 2 other healing classes combined?  I don't believe you.<P>You'd think with all this versatility people would learn how to use it to their advantage.  Hell when I'm playing my rogue we don't let the presence of a cleric dictate our playing.  We get by just fine with the versatility of the other classes --there are huge strengths in them.<P>""Perhaps this is the reasoning as to why there are so few clerics around."<P>So few?

</FONT><HR>&lt;&lt;&lt;I'm sure you'll complain with the same logic of the 'monopoly' that wizards have as the masters of DD. Perhaps the 'monopoly' on tanking that warriors have. The 'monopoly' of melee damage that monks/rogues have.&gt;&gt;&gt;<P>Just, I have been saying this too, on many threads.  As it stands now, cleric/warrior/rogue/chanter have become the most "powerful" classes in the high level game.  Parity was killed the day ROK came out. The differences between the classes wasn't that great prior to ROK that you couldn't substitute one class for another with equal success.  Druids/shamans could readily fill the role of sole healer in those pre 50 days.  Did that hurt clerics anymore then?<P>This is just no longer true now.  Of course a group dies when the cleric goes.  Sure we can try to pick things off without one, but no way inside dungeons.  Dying at level 28, for example, is no big deal.  Exp can be recovered fairly quickly.  Dying at 55 HURTS.  So I will STILL want a cleric in the group.<P>The healing ability of druids and shamans in the post 50 level just doesn't cut it.  They simply can't keep up with the damage.  I'm a ranger, and as a ranger I want a cleric in my group.  But when that cleric goes it would be nice to have a viable alternative instead of having to sit for ages looking for a replacement or flat out logging. It is patently unfair that for the LACK of a single class, people are unable to play.  THAT's Verant's motive here, and it is a good one. Please don't say then go hunt a solo mob somewhere in the woods.  Just play a post 50 tank and then you will see what I and many others are saying.  And when you find that you can't get a group, dollars to donuts says you will log off ya tank and pull out your cleric.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Can we at least wait and see how it works.  I think you clerics opposed to the changes are being unnecessarily paranoid.  I doubt that 95% of groups would ever choose a druid/shaman over a cleric.  That 1 in 20 that did, you didn't want to be a part of anyway for they were morons.<P>Class envy is foolish, so to simply claim we are an uberclass without actually stepping on your class toes is not a legitimate argument.  The only possible argument could be that druids would keep you out of a group.  As you've not seen anyone say they'd choose a druid over a cleric, this concern appears unfounded.<P>Druids do not bring anything to a group if they are acting as a healer, except, maybe EVAC.  And due to our significant disadvantage at healing compared to a cleric (even after the changes), that EVAC may happen much more often than if we were lucky enough to get a cleric to do the healing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

(Or everyone gets tired)<BR>- All healing classes receive a small healing boost.<BR>- Clerics remain the best healers, best ac/hp buffers, best res'ers, among other things.<P>Absor said, "Clerics will always, let me repeat, always be far superior healers than any other class. Keep a few things in mind here. Clerics get any shared healing spell many levels earlier than any other class. Clerics have a larger variety of healing spells to choose from, making them much more flexible in their healing powers. Clerics are also innately better healers than any other class. They will heal more hit points with the same spell than any other class (they have a built in bonus on all their healing)."<P>Aradune said, "NO one item should be necessary to be victorious in an expansion, or even significant parts of an expansion..."  (This should of course apply to a single SPELL and also to a single CLASS)<P>Search the threads for "Mudflation" and "Mobflation" and it will become very clear that you don't want more healing in EverQuest. You want to redistribute the healing that's already there to create balance.<P>...and I'd love to read responses from 55th+ players that do not play a cleric.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Usually 5 to 7 hours a week.<P>My little Cleric is at level 40 now and im really sure he will never see the high end game. Im not very angry about this, cause all i hear from ANY high end player is, that the High end aerea is Frustrating, Boring, Annoying and whatever else.<P>So i dosent care about ANY changes in this aerea.<P>So, now to my Point.<BR>I enjoyed my life as a cleric.<BR>At level 35+ i was REALLY pleased with my life.<BR>All i had to do was, log in, shout 1 or 2 time for a group, and was in.<P>That was easy and dosent take much of my precious gaming time to look for a group. Also i enjoyed, that most groups automatically call me the chief. I was really surprised at first, but think by the time i filled the role i never ask for. <P>So live was easy .. at 35+<P>Below this level i suffer like everybody else in search for a group.<BR>Hey dont laugh, it was really a pain sometimes.<BR>Maybe it was so, because im on an old server (Sol Ro) and nearly everybody there is a twink.<P>But i think, the hardest part in an clerics life is the way from 12 to 39. At this stages, it isnt so easy as many out here say. <BR>I read in various threads, that a cleric can do some solo play in the right places.<P>Well i could use some advice in this...<BR>All my trys in this aerea where very frustrating. Well feel free to call me dumb ... but i think it isnt possible at all.<P>Also i have to State here<BR>I DOSENT WANT to solo anything here...<BR>DAMM im a Cleric !!<BR>I Choose those Class to support.<P>So all i want for the cleric is some more ..<BR>Uh .. Support Power .. for the lower to Middle level range. <BR>More Support for groups means ALL advance faster.<P>Well its hard to make some suggestions for spells or Skills without touching other classes. <BR>But i think the Anti undead spells are a good field to play around with.<BR>We can do some more here.<BR>Some utillity spells against undead only would be a great enhancement.<BR>Maybe it is possible to expand some of the the spells with effekts against undead only.<P>This would also affekt the Paladin , cause he shares a good amount of our Spells.<P>One Idea was...<BR>Make those hammer that we can summon to a throwing weapon, aplly a proc to it against undead, and make him tradeable.<P>Well this idea is only a funny thing, i know that the cleric isnt good at thrownig. <BR>But i feel that something has to be done with this Hammer ...<BR>seems noone really use it, and so its the right Playfield for some experiments..<BR> <P>And at a last Point to all those ..<BR>uhmm so called Whiners ...<P>Go on ...<BR>I can understand when someone is frustrated or maybe really angry about any changes that might affekt them.<P>If i have enough from whineposts..<BR>i dosent read them anymore..<P>Greetings from good old germany<P>Dirak<BR>40th Brell cleric<BR>Solusek Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Druids are healers.  First spell circle we get includes healing.  It's fine for you to have an opinion, but to keep screaming it at the top of your lungs in the face of the evidence to the contrary appears rather foolish.<P>Goji:  It may be convenient to blame druids for this modification, but it is erroneous.  First, we weren't whining class envy stuff.  We've stated we've had difficulties getting groups.  We didn't ask for your spells.  We asked for a role we once had to be returned to us.  Half of those asking for druid healing, weren't druids.  Can you pull your head out of the sand for a minute and accept that the healing disparity wasn't a problem for druids but for the other 13 classes?<P>Fyrestaff:  A pet class?  ROFLMAO!

</FONT><HR>What I dont understand it this:<P>I thought that this whole class based game was about choices.  The choice to be a cleric was to be a healer and give up other things like snare, sow, melee and other things.  The choice to be a Druid or a Shaman was to get utility spells, and to heal, but as utility, not core.  Now it seems that Druids and Shaman are'nt happy with thier choice as a utility class and want more "core" abilities of another class.  <P>Thats not right.  In my opinion you knew what being a Druid or Shaman was when you chose to play it.  You now want it both ways, if you should get anything at all it should be reduced lvl for Sup. heal and reduced fizzle rates.  Your already "balanced".

</FONT><HR>Furbie:  Are you even reading any of the posts from druids or your fellow clerics?  As a druid, I am a healer.  Secondary, but a healer nonetheless.  Here's the problem?<P>1.  More healers are needed post-50.<P>2.  Druids were losing out on the group game, for no one really needed their second best roles for their are others more complementary to a group.<P>Solution:  Increase druid/shaman healing to partially fill the gap.  Druid/shaman get in groups, for their reinvigorated skill set is viable again.  And NEEDED!<P>Come up with another solution to that problem which makes sense, and we'll be glad to take a peak.  Until then, the whining is simply childish.

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;It would be similar to a cleric getting an updated MR based DD from a wizzie which is about the same in power and most useful to a wizzie; and we know that doesn't make any sense to do.<P><BR>Eh.<P>We already get that on every level from 1-48 and then one last time (for good measure) at 59.<BR>Mages and druids get dds only slightly weaker than us.  On a few levels even clerics and enchanters can dd as well as us =\<P>The change hits you the hardest because you actually WERE leaps and bounds better beforehand.  Now you will only be marginally better (of course, you still will be the only real group healer, since you have more heals and can RES).<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>And as for people requiring a group...<P>Show me *1* class who can solo (reasonably) from 55-60.<P>No, killing one low blue/high green every 20 minutes for a month to get a level is not "reasonable".<P>Warriors/Rogues/monks/: Require a group for roughly 80-90 % of the time.<P>Paladins/Sks/Rangers/Bards/Clerics: Require a group for about 70-80 % of the time.<P>Wizards/Shaman: Require a group about 60-70 % of the time.<P>Necro/Druid/Mage: Require a group about 50-60 % of the time.<P>Unless they are well twinked, no pure melee can solo at all past about 15-20.<P>Clerics are very limited in their soloing abilities, but they still can solo fairly well.<P>At some point, every one dies. For that reason, you *NEED* a cleric for every reasonably high level group, otherwise you are taking a huge risk (paladins will do i guess, have fun finding a level 59 paladin though).<P>If paladins got the level 49 res on 55 or so, then yes, I would say that clerics would probably be put out most of the time in groups that were not very high-hp tank heavy.  Obviously druids (who have buffs better suited for casters) would be preferred here.  <P>Clerics will still be a "preferred" class.  But Knowing that I could do just as well with:<P>- Druid<BR>- Paladin<BR>- Enchanter<BR>- Ranger<BR>- Wizard<BR>- Rogue<P>As with:<P>- Cleric<BR>- Warrior<BR>- Ranger<BR>- Rogue<BR>- Enchanter<BR>- Mage<P>Is something that would make this game much more enjoyable.<P>Right now group a would be slaughtered while b had an easy time. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Furbie:  If you understood debate, and the amount of time that this foolish whining has gone on and the number of threads, you'd have the first inkling of a clue why the one word answers were used.  Every single one of these points has been beaten to death in thread after thread.  When the foolish whiners get tired of having their lunch handed to them, they simply start another whine.  I wonder if you understand irony.  "You stating the same arguments over and over with no substance is just childish ranting."  Do you see how hysterical this is, since it is you folks that are engaging in this behavior?<P>It's really fun on the play ground to simply state a conclusion without any facts.  It's fun to claim that druids are the only ones whining to get this upgrade.  It's completely erroneous, as even a review of this thread would show.  But, please, don't let the facts get in the way of a good whine.<P>I group very well.  When I can find folks I know, I generally get into the group because they know I know what I'm doing.  However, there is a huge gap post 50 (most prominently post-55), that the best played druid or shaman can't fill, and its a role that is needed:  Healer.  You can continue to claim there is no healing gap, but you'd be wrong again.  The number of non-druids complaining about the gap and cleric monopoly demonstrates that pretty well.<P>If you don't play a druid into the high-levels, it's rather foolish of you to claim that the reason druids have a problem is because they aren't played very well.  Isn't it just as reasonable (actually a lot more reasonable, but I'll humour you) that the problems exist within the structure of the class, not the players.<P>Sorry that you refuse to read or acknowledge the comments of the multitudes of non-druids who have made the comment:  No cleric, no group.  Just because you refuse to accept it, doesn't mean it isn't true.  Are you a member of the Flat Earth Society?<P>Where did you hear anyone in this thread or any other whine that they needed to be able to heal?  We used to be healers.  After 50, we aren't.  Rather than rant without basis, why don't you try and be constructive and offer some suggestions?<P>1.  Why shouldn't druids be permitted to act as a healer post 50, like we did for the prior 50 levels?  I specialized in Alteration for this purpose, long before they nerfed our healing post-50 by not putting any into the game.<P>2.  What should be done about the lack of healers post-50?  I understand that you apparently refuse to accept that it exists, but why not pretend it does for a moment?  The other 13 classes, as well as a lot of clerics in this thread, seem to think it does.<P>3.  Why is it that you are upset about this upgrade?  Do you think it'll effect you somehow?  As has been stated on numerous occasions by every class in the game, if any group refused a cleric solely because they already had a druid or a shaman, that group should immediately fold because they are stupid.  If a cleric is available and a free group slot, they ought to be put into it.  Every single time.<P>You can continue to flame me and avoid the debate, but it'll only indicate that you are the one being childish by trying to protect your monopoly.  Just because you feel druids have had it easy til now, and you haven't, doesn't justify disenfranchising us in the latter quarter of the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Furbie:  More childish rants.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif">  Read the threads.  No where have I said "I'm right and you're wrong just cuz".  I've argued the point numerous times, not just the ones on this page.  I've supported my positions and ideas by referencing posts of your fellow clerics and other non-druids.  <P>Yes, above I just said WRONG a couple times, but since the folks I was referring to simply made the contrary claim with just as much evidence or support, the response was justified.  It had also been said many, many times before.  You understand sarcasm right?  And I don't mean the playground taunting that you are doing.<P>From your responses, I can see that you refuse to actually engage in a debate, and just want to rant and taunt and act like a fool.  I'll leave you to it.  If you decide to actually respond in a rational and mature manner, I'll be happy to answer you.  If not, your choice will make it clearer than I ever could that there is no merit to your claims.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Actually I did offer a very good solution.  You just didnt read it evidently.<P>I said that Sup. heal should have the level lowered and the Fizzle rate lowered.<P>Druids were healers only when they chose to be, they did everything else too, so why dont you want to be Melee'ers or Nukers, hmmm? Cuz you already do those things well and you just now wanna be better healers too. Very selfish, which seems to be where this is heading all too quickly.<P>If you specialized in alteration as a Dr00d, than that is your tough choice, not all the clerics that you propose to trivialize with these changes.<P>And, is there a lack of healers or a lack of content for Druids or Shaman to do "without" healers that is your whining all about.  <P>I was also using sarcasm and irony to point out that you were'nt doing anything but flaming the posters here for having the opinion that druids shouldn't get more healing.  What have you got to lose if you group so well as you claim?  Does it hurt you if the clerics get upset and leave because druids and shaman infringed on their turf?<BR>If they leave in disgust will you be here the next day whining for more healing because there are "less" clerics than before?<P>It sounds like rather than Druids and Shaman that need more healing, its we need more Druids and Shaman to become Clerics if more healing is needed.  That fits all your petty powergrabbing but you would have to work for it, and it seems thats not the Druid style.<P>Call me foolish all you want, but it doesn't make what you want the right solution, only your selfishness makes it right to YOU.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
