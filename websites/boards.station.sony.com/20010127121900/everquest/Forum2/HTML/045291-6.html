</FONT><HR>Hi there,<P>I'm only a 24 Necro and don't know about a lot <BR>of the high level issues but the problem of <BR>pets pathing, or fearing on big raid seems to <BR>prevent them from being used. If there could be <BR>implemented a "/pet leash" option to tell the pet <BR>to not go further than a small radius away from <BR>the caster (kind of like the Enchanters pet). <BR>That  might help a great deal. If the pet is <BR>Feared or Summoned away, then the pet would under <BR>go an immediate "/pet get lost" since the "leash" <BR>was broken. Thus, pathing problems would be <BR>reduced and fear/summon would not be an issue in <BR>the planes etc. I don't think the coding would be <BR>too difficult for this and it might breath new <BR>life into the pet classes (mages and necros). If <BR>I'm wrong .. forgive my ignorance :-)<P>Cheers Abyzzmyll .. lowly grave robber</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Happy monday!<P>Just going to give a summary of my ideas since they were buried...<P>1) Reduce the damage of Touch of night to 500 damage -OR- Give it a recast time of 3 minutes (meaning 720 damage every 3 minutes)<BR>2) Remove Trucidation (our highest tap)<BR>3) Make taps irressistable as they were originally designed (or close to it).  Meaning if principle 1 & 2 were implemented, a necro could do miniscule damage (320 every 3 second cast, or 500 every 6 second cast).  We would not replace wizards, but would be able to tap, meaning we could heal, lich etc, and perform our 2ndary roles.<P>Wizards should do the most damage, but 2 necros should be able to simulate this damage roughly.  <P>Absor, you never answered why taps couldn't be made more save friendly.  This suggestion would NOT effect day-to-day groups as everything we fight BESIDES uber mobs are already 100% tapable.  This would ONLY affect uber mobs, as they are the only creatures with artifical immunities.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sorry Zrazzt but 3 minute recast on a 720dmg spell would make it worthless. 3 minutes is an eternity! I'd be dead through lich in less than 3 minutes let alone taking any mob damage. If lifetaps were unresistable then 30-45seconds should be about the absolute limit for recast time.<P>Personally though I still prefer the option of having the 50+ lifetaps on lure resistances as I think this is entirely balanced without making any changes to the existing spells (short of reworking trucidation but that's more related to the component and recast time than the dmg/mana ratio).<P>I see a lot of posters in this thread getting carried away (and weakening the thread in the process). We are NOT going to get anything that makes us more powerful generally, to keep requesting them just makes it easier for trolls to feed and even Verant dismiss the thread as a santa's wishlist.<P>On group DMF I'm unconvinced also. Sure there's a couple of cases where it's essential and currently time-consuming to group cast but I don't think it's so bad to warrant a new spell. I certainly wouldn't use it outside of raids as hardly anyone in 6-man groups want it.<P>I do agree with lowering the level of summon corpse to 55 though (and I also think it should be buyable) - 39-57 is a long long time to wait for an upgrade. The lvl 39 summon corpse just isn;t suited for large scale raids and players can expect to go on these from 50 onwards, would be nice to be thrown a bone earlier...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just a note about pet fearing.<P>I feel that all pets should be immune to fear. With the way pathing works (I won't say shoddy, I want to keep this positive-oops I just did), a feared pet ruins a dungeon adventure.<P>The pvp argument is a joke, that's like saying the whole class has to stay after because Joey threw a spitwad. 3 servers shouldn't dictate policy for the rest. We are all quite aware that pvp is an afterthought with EQ, let's keep it that way, please.<P>I also feel that Lifetaps should be /extremely/ unresistable, but as I am not in an uberguild, I won't even bother to contribute my thoughts on high level balancing since my thoughts do not matter, thanks to the uberVision (tm). Damn, I wanted to keep it positive, sorry Alan.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Use ToN as the mob gets low on health, or as you get low on health.  <P>My reasoning for the 3 minutes was this:  Could only cast once on pre-velious mobs, and 3 times on the velious mobs with a lot of hp...<P>Gives a nice balance to it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Now people are probly think what do u mean by that.  Well say u cast it on Naggy(just an example and i know its not post 55) Make the Skin rip off and have the skeleton of the dragon and the bones on fire or frozen bones for the later spell.  I mean it makes perfect sense and the tanks and casters would have no problem seeing dragon bones on fire.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Good day everyone [including you Trolls lurking out there].  Hope everyone had a good weekend and is ready to take up the fight once more.<P>I took sometime to think over the problem and came up with a couple ideas.<P>First on Pets:  The problem with the Necro pet in most Epic fights is with the poor resistance rates of Pets.  Even if I can get my pet buffed it does not last very long against mobs with massive AoE spells [ie Trak or Queen in Chardok].  Yet I remembered that Mages pets have some immunities for their pets which makes then resistance to certain attacks.  For example if you are fighting Ragefire [who uses AoE Fire attacks] a Mage could use a Fire pet [which is immune to Fire attacks].  The Air Pet is immune to Poison and the Water Pet is immune to Cold.<P>So how about the Necro pet being immune to Poison and Diease attacks.  Think about it for a second.  What effect would either have upon a Skeleton?  There is no nervous system to attack, no vital organs, hell there is no flesh...  This seems like a viable upgrade to Necro pets and is rather limited in options as to not overpower the pet.<P>I know the idea of Fearless pets was shot down [and with good reasons] but I liked the idea of Fearless undead.  So how about this idea.  Because the Necro Pet is mindless and mearly obeys the commands and will of it's master that it is only affected by fear IF the master is feared.  Again this does not seem to over balancing and would at least give Necro pets a better chance when facing mobs with AoE fear spells.  This should not be a PvP problem as Fear has been disabled upon the PvP servers for over a year now.  Another idea would be a change to the  59th lvl Specter Pet.  This pet requires an 11pp regeant and seems to be on longer special.  It use to summon with auto duel wield but now a days all pets above a certain level do, so that ability is no longer special for the Specter Pet.  How about this Pet is Immune to Fear.  It is a Specter and the most powerful pet we can summon.<P>On Life Taps and Drains:  I still think either mobs are flaged to be immune to these spell lines or they are magic immune.  If I can land these spells on Players with over a 200+ Magic Resistance without a single resist then something seems wrong.  Please look into this.<P>On Ignite/Chill Bones:  I still think the Illusion effect should just go away.  It's only purpose is purily visual now and it has become a hinderence against Giant sized mob because of the size change.  If removing the Illusion is not an option then make the Illusion server some real purpose.  Perhaps a HUGE debuff to the element of the spell [ie fire for Ignite and cold for Chill].  Just do something to make this spell more acceptable in Epic fights against Giant class mobs.<P>I am willing to do what it takes to kill an epic mob but I am frustrated that I am finding myself playing 'Manastone' instead of being the Damage dealer that I have been for 58 levels.<P>Well thanks for your time Absor and please continue to work with us at this issue.  <P>Briljin D'Aerthe<BR>58th lvl DE Defiler</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hmmm, stayed away for a few days to see how things would progress.  It still seems to boil down to:<P>- Remove Skele Illusion (seems they could replace it with some other unique effect, maybe the skulls from fear but change color? like blue or red - sick of those green skulls floating around anyway)<P>- Fix DoT corpse poofing (possibly done)<P>- a debuff upgrade<P>Not many other viable options I guess.  Some pretty amusing ones though ("We dont want to be overpowered, we just think our spells should have no chance of being resisted").<P>BTW - Please people, dont try to sound like you speak for the entire population when you say necros are upset or leaving/retiring.  Dont you think Absor has access to that type of info?  If there was that big of a problem they would have been on it before this thread was started.<P>On a side note, I have to ask - <P>Did anyone actually read Absor's post?<P>(hint: possible solutions will not include the word "tap")<P>I wonder if he'll even revisit this thread after laying out guidelines and then having 6 pages of posts that dont follow them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

You repeat what YOU think are good ideas and belittle those idea's you think are bad.  <P>There would be no powershift if taps on ubers (and the nerfs I listed) were implemented.  As this would only affect epic encounters.  Saying "did anyone read absor's post" is silly.  Yes we read it.  Its called a debate.  He states his point, then we state ours, trying to show why our point is correct.  <P>As it stands, necros NEED taps to fulfil ANY of their secondary roles with any efficiency.  Anything short of giving us a method to replenish our own hitpoints is a grave understatement of the problem.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi<P>Instead of making the pet immune to fear, why not a set of short-term pet-only buff spells (rm, rp...). <P>Only magician pets would be completely immune to certain elements (built in capacity) but our pets could resist a little more with such buffs (it is always difficult to explain an already overwhelmed buffer to buff the pet during a buffing session...)<P>Or it could be a special questable focus items for each resist ability,  <P>Another idea I would propose would be a short duration vampiric embrace type spell (random lifetap proc) that you could cast on the pet but that would heal the necro himself instead of the pet. So that, even against a 100% rm mob, we could still drain some life to fuel our other abilities (lich to feed mana, transfer hp...).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It would add a little damage output for only the highest lvl necros and not be totally unbalancing like some of the other nonsense that has been mentioned.<P>Too bad there arent many more reasonable ideas like this.<P>Absor - I mentioned it in my post above, but couldnt the skele illusion be changed to the fear effect and just change the color of the little green skulls or something simple like that?

</FONT><HR>Alan <P>is it possible to reduce the resistances on planes/high level zone mobs ( but not preplanes/54 under)only to dots and/or lifetap, and as a reprecussion reduce the amount of dots or limit the amount that can be stacked on a mob? How about a spell that drastically reduces the speed on a persons pet so that which a fear spell wouldnt train the entire zone and would give enough time for the necro to destroy the pet? it would be self only ( as in only you can cast it on your pet ) . <P>Personally i dont think you should change ignite bones to not turning the mob into a skeleton because frankly thats what makes the spell unique.However, maybe you can make the skeleton the size of the original mob?<P>on a side note, i find it very humorous some of these ideas necros have to make themselves extremely powerfull in planes/high level places. Necromancers ruled the soloing realm from levels 1-50 and from what i saw in most zones boosted about it, and took other class's complaining about they're power as "jealous" or if you want the power be a necro yourself. But now that they find out that they're not all that in the planes or high level zones they call it an outrage and demand a change? <P>the biggest argument that i saw in the previous boards was that they're role dramatically changed to where the class wasnt fun, and no other class had to deal with that.. to keep this post clean i will just say thats ..absurd  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <BR>lets go through the rundown<P>warriors : past 35 they're damage they do isnt really significant its basically how much hp they have and AC, and how much damage thy can take before they fall. pre 35 they're damage actually mattered in a fight, and could help change the precourse of it. thats not to say that slashing for 200 damage doesnt help but when a mob has more than 6000 hp its the casters job to get it down.<P>clerics  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif">ast 35 its basically how much they can heal/buff the tanks to keep them alive, besides that its sitting on their toosh to med.pre 35, ive seen many clerics tanking with they're group ,stunning the mob , controlling the fear part of the fight and overall a more diverse roll<P>druids: hmm, yeah necros do crap in planes raids. what do druids do? damage shield and occasionally the secondary healer /buffer. they're nukes which are mostly fire based are resisted a lot, and having a 52 druid myself i know that my heal does jack when a mob hits for half my healing spell. same with sebellis and some of vellius too..<P><BR>People, when your fighting in an area designed to be hard when your in a giant group of 40 say of course your role is going to change. I bet the healers are a lot more appreciatie of you necros mana transfer than you give them credit for. Summon corpse, yeah thats completely useless, only reduces the downtime on a group by hours. <P><BR>its a game, deal with it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> the only reason i suggested these things was to improve the role necros had in a group<P>dorbin swiftmoon 52nd druid<BR>onitoguro ds'pyre 30th necro *gasp, i have one =P<BR>fienn 16nth rogue <BR>reathorn funkmaster 25th warrior <BR>eloritomb 11nth enchanter<BR>zzokarul 10nth monk <BR>Aariena 7nth lvl bard<P><BR>all of the tribunal </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Kyt,<P>I agree.  Some are beyond the scope of what Alan has asked this thread to be about, but you have to understand, people will take an opportunity where a blue name is listening to try and get other problems/issues looked at.  Its so rare that you feel your voice is heard on these boards.<P>But, lets look at facts:<P>Fact 1; Taps are NOT resistable AT ALL on 95% of all encounters<BR>Fact 2; Taps damage/mana ratio is bad.  It is only decent when you factor in the healing.  Chain nuking while full health is mana inefficient<BR>Fact 3; Taps are required to lich and heal others.<BR>Fact 4; With the mana dump spells current ratio, liching is required to do this in order to make it worthwhile for the necro to be on the raid (see fact 3)<BR>Fact 5; Making taps irresistable on uber mobs would only affect that part of the game (see fact 1)<BR>Fact 6; Touch of night (ToN) would be overpowering if Fact 5 became reality, so it must be nerfed, if and only if fact 5 came into play.  If taps could be partially resisted, then ToN should be left as is, as a partial resist on 720 is acceptable, a partial resist on 320 would be laughable.<P><BR>These are all facts   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Therefore, if the necro is to play a support role then taps must be enabled.  It is that simple.  It would not affect the other parts of the game.

</FONT><HR> See the problem with a Necro being a poor support during the final battle is that that is the only fight that matters. You can say, 'Well, didn't you guys have to go through some hard fights to get there.' To this, I would have to say yes. However, no group which can kill the end mob is going to be creamed by the stuff on the way. A group which can kill all the stuff on the way has no assurance of killing the boss mob. Add to this the ever present limitations of bandwidth (ie. You get more lag and LD the more people you have) and you have a powerful disincentive to have a necromance there at all. Why drag someone along who made absolutly no difference in the sucess of the raid on the way to the boss mob, who will only have a tiny tiny differnce in the outcome of the end fight. I'd rather take almost any class. <BR> The extremly useful parts of the necromancer class, namely free lev and corpse summon, can be accomplished by a single necromancer. Adding a second only creates less work for each necromancer, at the expence of your power during the raid (an alternate would be better), and causes more lag (which is a strong consideration, do you know some guilds have badnwidth restrictions?).<BR> The 'end game' as you don't like to call it, revolves around large groups of people killing large mobs. This is where the best loot is. This is where most of the prestige is. People have more fun going after Saruman than some gnolls on the way there. As it stands now, there is simply no reason to take along more than one necromancer on the raid, except for the fact that these are our guild brothers. <P> To sum up. You state that<P>Necromancers are just fine, in all aspects of the game, with one possible exception.<P>On raids they can find a lot to do up to and after the encounter with the boss mob. But in that encounter some necromancers don't feel that they have enough to do, or feel that what they can do isn't what they want to be doing.<P>However, the reality is that no one cares about up to and after the encounter with the boss mob. Anyone who can kill the boss mob will consider up to and after the encounter trivial. I can't remember the last time we had to use summon corpse to retrieve. Thus the sole use of a necromancer to my guild, is to pump mana and cast DMF. <P> In fact, the reality is that up to and after the encounter with the boss mob, necromancers already face large problems. When moving through a zone towards a large encounter, targets usually die so fast, that DoTs are useless. Pets, due to horrible pathing, have been universally regarded as 'not worth it', especially while moving. Which basically leaves the necromancer with taps, the ignite/chill bones, and mana transfer. Taps work here, necros use them.. have you checked how horribly ineffiecent they are? Again, why bring a necro. Ignite bones/Chill bones changes the graphic of the target AND the size.<BR>1.) Changing the size of the target is BAD. Target size affects how close you can be to the target and still hit it. This helps A LOT when you have 20-30 melee all clustered around a target trying to hit it. In case you've never been on a large raid like this, it is a real problem. You drop a giant down to a skeleton, and all of the sudden half your melee aren't doing damage.<BR>2.) Graphic and size: You say, 'Can't you adjust tactics'. The answer is really no. On a raid you have people using amulets of necropotence, usually ogres and trolls.. large races.. to illusion down into the smaller model of the skeleton to not block people. Suddenly there is a skeleton instead of the monster, which skeleton. Still, look at the damage ignite bones doesn.. not too much right? Well, look at the damage 20-30 melee do, let's say they loose the targe for 1 second, they've just lost 2x as much damage as the ignite did. Lets say, then a wizard accidentally overnukes.. the mob suddenly runs over. You've got 20-30 melee standing in a cicrle around nothing.. trying to find this.. skeleton, admist 4-5 skeletons + pets.. Ok, now you've lost 2-3 seconds of melee damage. You only need to have 3-4 melee get confused for a sec to loose any damage you caused with ignite. <BR> <BR> So, this is the situation. You bring along 1 necro to DMF everyone. You tell the other necros to log out and play some other class. You do this because you don't want to waste a cleric healing them, and you don't want the additional lag they will cause. This is the pinacle of power a necromancer achieves after 60 levels: DMF.<P> I really don't think this is fair. People will spend more time at 60 they they did getting there. To be limited to such a crappy role is just horrid design. <P> I, personally, have no problems with a necromancer getting some lure poison/disease nukes. Not as powerful as wizard nukes of course, but not too far away. Either that, or make a 60 pet which gains the resistances of the necromancer. Or, make it so they necromancer can switch into the pet and control it. <P> Sauron was a necromancer. Let's say he strode up to our heros in the Lord of the Rings one day. "And then, Sauron stretch forth his hand, and the Ringwraiths with him looked even more dead and began to float above the ground.. bobbing up and down. Sauron then bid them attack, and sat down to med." Of course, immediatly after this, the Ringwraiths were all feared. Sauron tried to lifetap Aragon but was resisted, and then was promtpy killed.<P> Everyone who has played this game has done so with the hope that they will have a use, a real use, after leveling. Some classes do. Warriors are a wonderful example. Probably one of the deeper classes, in that they offer so much, and can really make a difference when played well. Rogues/Monks also, they have a roll which *gasp* makes a difference. Then you have the classes which have leveled for 60 levels and reach their goal only to find that they are marginal at best. The Necromancer is the prime example of this. From a gamers stand point, if you can't acknowledge this and do something about it, I for one, would be extremly hesitant to ever play another RPG you created. For, after picking a class in your new game, I would be unsure that the class would actually be usefull at the end.<P>Creediki Starsong<BR>Bard of Veeshan<BR>Chronicler of the Fires of Heaven<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"Why are you requesting changes for ignite/chill bones? Only ONE necromancer can use the spell anyway."<P>Actually that is incorrect.  The Illusion is what keeps lower level Necros from casting it after a higher lvl Necro has.  If the Illusion was removed this would not be a problem.<P>Also if I remember correctly a lower level Necro can cast Ignite and affect a mob under the effects of Chill Bones.  The Illusions are unrelated between the two spell [they are different Illusion].<P>"However, maybe you can make the skeleton the size of the original mob?"<P>That would be fine but that would involve much more programming and more Global memory to store the different 'Skeletal illusions' for it.

</FONT><HR>Since the magic resistance of a lot of high level encounters makes wizzies and other nukers useless I'm partial to making the scent line more useful in reducing the magic,and other resistances of these NPCs. Of course then scent itself would have to be resisted less. This would make both necro's and then all nukers more useful in uber encounters. This wouldn't really make necros more powerful while soloing as I don't think most necros would use scent any more than they do now while soloing (in my case not at all.) </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>People are getting way off topic here with lots of wish lists and class envy things. If you are not a necro that has played at least a year or you are not 50 or above, please dont post here. You have no clue of the class.<P>1. On uber mob fights. Uber mobs (dragons, etc) in general are almost totally immune to magic. Most of our spells are magic based, therefore we can do little direct dmg. Pets can take the place of our missing magic dmg by supplementing melee dmg, but as everyone knows, pets are feared 90% of time in these fights. I do not see why Verant has a huge problem with our pets being immune to fear , disease or poison. Arent mage pets immune to fire, etc? So does that mean they will give fire immunity to all pet users? No.  I think perhaps since there is little dmg or hp difference in our hard earned post 50 pets, perhaps one could be immune to fear, one to disease, one to poison. Or perhaps give necros a general pet buff that can raise resistances significantly (at least enough to matter).<P>2. They point out we may have little to do during the fight but can help before or after. I dont know if you guys have noticed, but epic mobs take a certain number of people.  Any more, and you risk crashing the zone or causing massive lds which will destroy the fight, any less and you are also doomed to failure. Usually 35-50 is acceptable.  With so few limited spaces, they are A LOT less likely to invite necromancers along. Sure we can help with mana regen (slightly), but if that means there will be room for one less wizard that will be able to do 8k of dmg during the fight, guess who will be left at home? Sure we can summon bodies if the raid fails, but I have news for you. Necros will not be on the raid, but will be called in from wherever they are to assist afterwards. Thats really fun. Let me drop all that i am doing to assist this raid i will get jack from. <P>Necromancers are damage dealers pure and simple, epic mobs are one of the few beasts that last long enough for our dots to effectively work on, however what is so frustrating is they are immune. Can I give healing and mana during the fight to help? Sure, but where am i getting the replacement hp? I sure cant tap anything, and the cleric is busy healing the tanks. This leads to the necro usually falling prey to the mob's aoe as he cannot heal himself. "dont worry we will rez ya after the fight". <P>Is it not possible to perhaps make the deflux line less resistable if not unresistable? All i know is the class quickly deteoriates after 50. It is a solo class... at 56 most mobs in skyfire become green. So, move over to the skyfire drakes and elder wyverns...um they summon; impossible to solo. at the 56+ range, the class become near impossible to do anything with! If i want to sit around and summon corpses at cost, hell im in business. Otherwise, im left to trying to pick through mobs on the far side of skyfire praying i dont run into a summoner. (on a side not, why do such mundane monsters have the ability to summon? i believe the summoning lvl should be raised to 53 at least).<P>Pet pathing: A really really good nec that has nothing at all to do can probably keep a pet in perfect control in a dungeon. Dont cast spells, no giving mana, no heals, no dots, nothing. Walk backwards watching your pet. Why is it SO hard to have a pet follow DIRECTLY in its master's footsteps? Why does it arbitrarily turn around and run the opposite way and around the corner? is it on a different tracking system? If a krup was on my tail and i am running, what are the chances it will suddenly turn around and run away?? 0! If pets pathing was made 100% more reliable, necros would at least have an opportunity to group in dungeons.<P>Also, a command that tells the pet to not attack even if the master is attacked would be GREAT. <P>the group feign death: an excellent idea. this would raise necro grouping tremendously. if you are going to change how the class works post 50, at least give us a chance (from solo to group).  other ideas: group levant, or aoe fear spell. this would give group time to evac or something, at least buy some time. <P>the mana giving and hp giving spells are nice bells and whistles. but groups have very very limited space:<BR>1. Warrior<BR>2. Cleric<BR>3. Enchanter<BR>4. Evac (druid wiz)<BR>5. Rogue/Monk (pulling or locks)<BR>6. Wiz/Druid/Monk/Rogue/shammy (whatever spot wasnt taken above.<P>What can a nec bring to a group looking to fill that last spot that would be better? Not much really. we have a pet we cant use, dots that dont work in 20 sec(fight time) and ruin mez if tank changes targets. <P>There need to be some changes made. Sure, we can still solo stuff, but nothing like in the past. The mob lvl (summoning, 15k hp mobs , etc) has determined we have to move away from soloing to grouping, yet we arent given any viable group weapons. Druids and wizards and mages can solo just as well as a necro, but also can easily get into a group at any time. Necromancers are the only class that apparently do a complete role reversal post 50, yet are given nothing to do that with.<P>Saboth<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
