</FONT><HR>I know I am going to open myself up to some flames here, but I am at the end of my bardish rope.  I have a 53rd level bard, this is my primary character with over 130 days played, I have no other character close to 50th level. A few days ago I decided to retire my beloved alter ego due to the lack of usefullness of the class. <P>Ours songs, already weak versions of the real spells, all other hybrids get full versions just later in levels, have been chipped away at till they are just overall unreliable.  The mana song is useful, but playing mana and being asked NOT to melee by clerics is not exactly playing a game, its watching other people play. <P>A well balanced group has no reason to invite a bard except to sing mana.  A poorly balanced group may invite the bard to do groups right at the zone of maybe a karnors, but not harder stuff.  The reason I decided at this time to stop is the haste fix, that was my finally  straw, it no longer even makes sense to mem VoV with its poor, non stacking haste.  <P>Bards were originally supposed to be a tri - class character warrior/wizard/rogue that has moved up to a new type of adventurer.  That combo is 2/3rds melee (warrior/rogue)  and 1/3 caster, (wizard the super damage spell class ), that all screams high damage output. There are many ways to fix the class, make songs effects = spell effect like the rest of the hybrids(remember we get a lot less songs then other classes get spells ),  give us the rest of the suite of warrior/rogue skills ( would DA with a cap of 100 unbalance the game ?, would a backstab capped at 100 take anything away from rogues if first given at 40th level  ), with lower caps of course, some stronger direct damage songs, would 100 points of damage be so unbalancing?  I could give a hundred suggestions but i will stop here. <P>Non bards ask yourself, when you invite a bard into a well balanced group, what do you expect him to do for the group. Jack of ALL trades, master of none. Being almost good enough does not cut it in highlevel game play. Vision or no vision the class should be playable at ALL levels. I like this game and I want to play it, please please rethink the vision a little, it would be okay if high level bards got to play too, I promise it wont unbalance the game. Funny thing is the bard is my favorite class, and with a couple of tweeks I would love to play him again regularly. <P>Kaldivar Tendertones<BR>53rd level bard </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Kaldivar, you really hit on something with the title of this thread "why bother anymore?". <P>I have several characters, most of whom are in their mid 30's and a couple in their 40's &lt;druid and enchanter&gt; but never have I been as frustrated as I am by my 35th level Bard. I love the concept of bards. I love the rp potential that a bard offers. I completely appreciate their self-less nature within the dynamic of a group and I am occasionally in awe of their soloing capabilities &lt;if you don't mind wearing out several keyboards with all the work that soloing involves&gt;. I REALLY want to play this character more often because for the first time in 18 months of playing EQ this is the first class that continually excites my imagination every time I log him on.<P>However... Upon reaching the early 30's I began to notice a change in the bard's effectiveness. This has a lot to do with other peoples' understanding of this class &lt;within a group&gt; as much as it does with my responsibility to learn how to play this class to it's fullest potential, but OMG is it irritating.<P>At level 35 I can no longer effectively ae mez a medium-sized pull of blue lizzies in CT. I can't really justify tanking since my melee skills seem to have completely evaporated before my eyes and charm? Ack! No thank you. Unless I'm doing something terribly wrong &lt;not out of the realm of possibilities&gt; at level 35 my single target charm &lt;level 27 song&gt; lasts approximately 10 to 15 secs. It's not continual so I have to re-start it when charm breaks. This not only shoots me to the top of the aggro list for the now formerly-charmed MoB but in places like Lower Guk, where pulls of 4 or more mobs are the norm, the need to constantly manage a single target keeps me from benefiting the group as a whole with either melee buffs with instruments or mana regen for the healer(s). At that point I'm nothing more than a mana sponge to the healer and perhaps a liability to the whole group since that healing mana is better spent on the puller who is on 3 other mobs hate lists. <P>No enchanter in the group? Don't worry we have a bard! Yeah, I've heard that before and not long after that well-intentioned yet fateful in-group message I see my ae mezzes are resisted and my single MoB charm breaks and I'm stunned and I can't melee well enough or long enough to give the real tanks a chance to jump in and taunt it off me and I'm in turn beaten to blue-armored pulp at which point I'm guaranteed to see....Loading, please wait.<P>Ahh, well, maybe it's me. Maybe it's my responsibility to educate each and every group of near-total strangers that I join/meet. Perhaps I need to make a social hot-key the says in-group "Hi there, I'm a bard! I'm not an enchanter, not a warrior/tank melee damager, not a wizard or even a rogue. I'm the guy who makes you all REALLY REALLY good at what it is that you do and it makes me happy and at times proud to do so. Now, just so everyone in the group understands that I don't mez, I don't charm, I don't tank, I don't save lives with my heals, I don't have the AC to pull effectively and btw I don't run fast indoors". The group leader then thinks to him/herself "Umm, why do we need a bard? Jeez, haste stack changes and all this baggage?" At which point I should hit group hot-key #2 and say "What I do offer is the opportunity to make the melee-ers in the group the best they can be,making them hit harder, faster and more accurately and in turn shorten each battles' duration &lt;provided that stats really do matter...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">&gt; which might just save some healer some mana and make for quicker pulls and faster experience gain because there's less downtime since they're casting maybe one less 300 mana cost heal on that 1400hp-having warrior. I'm the person who will, on his own, have the casters in the group regaining mana quicker and when there's an enchanter in the group, stacked clarity and my mana song = mana regen at ungodly rates &lt;thus further shortening downtime&gt;.<P>Oh well, I don't think those will all fit on a hot-key and I'm not sure I'm up to the task of educating the 2,500 people on my server as to why they should want a bard in their group anyway. I think I'll log on my enchanter. Yeah, that's what I'll do. But wait, first I need to make a group hot-key detailing why people HAVE to use /assist or they're gonna break my enthralls and then tell them about taunting to break mezz so that I'm not aggro'd on and............</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think what *kept* me at it, is that as a wood elf bard - I got an exp penalty from being a bard (the same as hybrids get but we're not considered hybrids - ha ha), an exp penalty for being a wood elf, plus because I started the game early on, my bard had bronze thru the 20's (ie she wasn't a twink).<P>What exp I got, was fought for tooth and nail.<P>There was a faith though, that our songs would sustain us and make us a good support character throughout our careers.<P>But, with things getting thoughtlessly weakened, all in the name of Who Knows What, I am seeing all these hours going for naught.<P>The only class/race combo that I feel worse for are Troll SK's (they have the highest exp penalty I believe).  But at least even then, they have some abilities that make them highly needed on dangerous raids. <P>Me, I'm just a mana battery with a sub-par snare, weak haste and laughable melee skills.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm most upset that Verant just simply ignores everything bards have to say these days.  We have issues and Abashi blatantly ignores them.  <P>Having said that, change your tactics.  I can pull nearly anything in the game, and I was always at my best with broken groups.  I've taken groups with no cleric and no enchanter and done the Warlord room in Karnor's, I can do the entire top floor of Sebilis without an enchanter, etc.<P>Granted, most of my friends say I'm the best they've ever seen, but I'd contend that not enough people play the class properly at 51+.  You're obviously one of the ones who needs to change tactics.  And to riposte the next argument away before you voice it, the style of the "camp controller" bard is probably more fun to play than any style of any class.<P>-FF</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Tholarion, as far as my play-style goes, you may be right, I may have to change my tactics, especially in what you perfectly called "a broken group". I acutally shuddered at that line! LoL.<P>If you're able to do crowd control at 51+ then I'm just not getting something when I can't do it well at 35. I've scoured the internet looking for higher level players' guides and all I've found so far are: "What songs to twist when you're soloing at level 15, etc..". Though useful for those levels, it doesn't take long to outgrow such advice.<P>If you have the time or inclination I'd love to read what songs you use to crowd control, what your charisma is, do you melee in high level groups or buff the group during combat with instruments equipped? All that bardic stuff is of interest to me and I'm sure to others. Also, if anyone reading this knows of a resource for such a guide (35+ playing strategies) then please post thier links here, I'd be in your debt. I'm really wanting to learn this class because it's by far the most original and challenging character to play on every level and has me coming back to EQ over and over.<P>When I have my 40th Enchanter or 40th Druid on and I think to myself "What class would I feel the proudest of for having gotten to 60?" the answer is always the bard. Their just too-cool.<P><BR>Signed: <BR>Dazed and confused &lt;but dying to learn&gt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have pretty much stopped playing my main Bard, at level 37 on Veeshan, as it is no longer needed, or useful to groups. Uber guilds like FoH, now proudly state that they can take down Trek with 10 Wizards and 10 Warriors, and then a couple of Clerics, and no need for Bards. Has Verant done anything about it? No. I don't see it.  Proportionally, they are losing a very high amount of Bards in the high levels, and this would seem to signal that they really should rethink their stand, but no. We get no songs fixed, and our ability to get to the top are even more stacked against us ... songs that are worthless because a CAP on the hastes, buffs and debuffs have already closed off the Bard songs. So we play mana. Now, another healthy mana user doesn't need it anymore ... the Cleric, if he/she can get that major weapon, and rest assured that all major Uber'ites will be getting it. So Furor's secondary account, a Cleric will get the REZ and he and others will never have to wait again ... I don't call this "balance". I call this a serious mis-matching and oversight as to the whole thing really means, and Verant wants to do.<P>I don't think they care. The Bards are not in the top 5 number of classes in this game, and when their need and usability gets disabled systematically, it is very difficult to enjoy playing it. <P>I am on the new server with a newbie Bard, and probably will stick with this one for a while. The level 37 one is not fun anymore, and no one wants, or needs a "group class" character anymore. They gain nothing from it at all, and it is not visible in the end result. <P>Verant just does not seem to care that so many high level Bards are disappearing. They do not belileve there is anything wrong with it, because on paper they are powerfull ... with the horrible exception that no single Bard player even comes within 25% of that paper numbers, because they would be dead in a second. And Verant is convinced that this class is too good.<P>In the end, they are only closing down their own doors. When the game loses its appeal because there are not enough choices ... all Quake players are the same ... the game will begin falling apart. I really want to see how good all those Level 60 weapons are gonna be, when there are not enough players to even attempt a Trek run!<P>I am not convinced they care, and would love to feel that they do. In the meantime, I'm just going to stick with the low level Moshkiae's .. they are fun, and much more enjoyable and I don't have to deal with so many dismantled songs out there ... it's just a total disgrace. But then, the only "grace" that Verant has displayed must be "making money".<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>But I should add, that even at lower levels, in places like Blackburrow and Crushbone, Bards are not most group's first choice ... because the damage we do is not "visible" per se. <P>I do wish that Verant would address that issue some, and it might help people rethink their strategy some and get a BArd into a group.

</FONT><HR>let me say this first.  i never ever played a bard,  never even felt like starting one.  sorry it's just not what i want to do. <BR>.<BR>. bards like everyother kind of hybrid is broken and will stay that way cause verant just don't care<BR>.<BR>.<BR>.that said you now must learn the hybrid golden rule.<BR>.....every time u get a new ability or fight in a a new zone or in a differnt group u must reevaluate your song list.  as for your mana song?  try playing it on down time only.  as for your tanking?  tank tank tank and play a damage shield if u want.  also tell the tanks in your group that if their taunt button ever shows unpressed that they should press it and also try n get them all to use shields.  {warriors often want to see their damage rather then keep damage from hitting the group especialy the casters).  if u fail to get a group in a zone thenstar a misfit group and see what differnt songs can do try maybe even a pull or two, use your invis and speedy song maybe some other combos. why?  cause only through experimentation can you learn new tactics.  even some old players get in ruts.   <BR>.<BR>.in the end game let me say this  "every class has a purpuse at every lvl" what happens though is people find combonations of groups that work even with so so players so then everyone looks for the said group members.  why?&gt;   cause it's easier to put together a soso group when class is the defining factor then when player ability to play is.  also if u have a problem with a player tactics in a group don't give up on group and either leave or have them leave but rather go and  talk to them and say "in this zone we use such and such tactics may i ask why you are useing difernt tactics?  maybe we can find an even better and safer way to hunt at this spawn.<BR>..of course doing this means you must actualy be "open minded to new tactics or address the concerns of the player" &lt;btw my necro doesn't like groups causeunless i have my damage absorbtion shield up i will die do to ineffective warrior taunts and healers who think necros can either heal self while beng hit or fd[not always work] or has ac/hitpoints as the tanks.  i have died many time only to hear a cleric say "i had no idea you'd go down that fast or i was the blasting cleric"  yep we are talking guk mentality here first time in many lvls that clerics have grouped with necros.  od i can solo 3 mobs simo but in groups i think every one still thinking i can do this.<BR>.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Camping stuff that goes for 10+kp, or start grouping in mid 40 zones.<P>Bards really peak right at upper 30s.  Its only when you go about 15 lvls higher, that true limitations of the Bard appears.  If you don't like your bard, and you are below that area, then don't even bother. <P>The true gripes of bards come when its time to go to the Hole, Sebilies, Karnors, and other high lvl dungeons.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First off,  I love my bard.  I had a bard (L45) on a shared acct.  and Rebuilt another when I got a new acct and my own computer.  (I've played all classes and been around since Beta) I am now L52 with my new bard.  <P>While, I enjoy what I can offer to a group, There are some things I can rant about just like everyone else, too.  <P>The Only things I would draw to attention of Verant is the Mez songs and Charm, though.  <P>My Charisma is 140.  If I am being relied upon to charm extra mobs,  I put on some charisma gear to about 165 and I equip my lute.  Yet My Charm lasts 2 to 4 ticks of the other songs I am juggling.  Since I know my charm wont last long,  I keep my pet targetted and just stand back and juggle VOV, Nilipus's March, and Clarity for the group - No Meleeing when Charming.  Although,  Groups I've been in used a Necromancers' Screaming Terror because it was more reliable than my charm's Duration.  To me,  that just seems odd that a necromancer would be more reliable for crowd control than a bard.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/confused.gif"><P>I was rather disappointed to try to Pixie Strike a mob 20 levels lower,  just to be resisted.  I am disappointed that our Mez always fails.  It saddens me that If I so much as ATTEMPT To Pixie Strike a Mob, an Enchanter cannot mez it for a certain amount of time . (Umm.. WHY?)  <P>I can hope that Sometime Verant will Make our AE Mez work, & Our Pixie strike and charms reliable.  I also Hope that Someday we can Pixie strike a mob off an Enchanter, let the enchanter step back and Mez it while it's stunned.  Now that would be Ideal to a bard.<P>With All that said.  I still love my bard.  I love getting an Insane Magic Resist and Lull Pulling Mobs that the Monks cant take the HT's of!   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cool.gif"><BR>I love fear kiting with my Rogue friend in Burning Woods - not many melee classes can do that.<BR>I love being able to solo when I want & group when I want (My retired L50 druid was never too group friendly -preKunark)<P>And, I really look forward to being able to play Catana.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>heh.  If you want to add to the joys of bard rants - Lets talk about our Epic quest needing two dragon scales that other classes need.  I Just LOVE Going on dragon raids and being told That the warriors are more melee based so they get the red scale & the casters will put the white scale to better use.  :rollseyes:<P>Sincerly<P>~Kiersten Atreides~<BR>L52 Minstrel (Holding for Dragon raids, but I doubt for much longer)<BR>Nameless Order<BR>Prexus Server<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First, thank you all for not flaming the heck out of me.  <BR>Second I want to say I really do want to play my bard and am hoping someone at Verant will read my post and consider ways to make bards consistantly playable at high levels.  <BR>Third the straw that broke the camels back is the haste issue.  <BR>I did not stop playing my bard when crowd control became a memory, <BR>I did not stop when they broke chains, which worked really well for over a year and poof, bard snare is not reliable.  <BR>I did not stop when a drop of lag turned me visable and got me killed time after time.  <BR>I did not stop when when I lagged and fell for 10k hps when bard lev poofed. <P>Now my combat songs are completely nerfed.  I go to mem VoV and wonder why bother.  I could solo kite almost non caster,except the lag monster, but bards are the class you pick if you like to group, dont change that on me a year and a half later. I am no longer the master of the group buff, just a battery lugged around by my friends. <P>OH mighty Verant hear the bards plee, and dont just say working as intended, look at the class origin, look at the high level game and take an action please.........!!!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well,  there are more things we can add to our "Bardic Wishlist"<P>Largo's Absonant Binding -  I love playing this song.  Neg Agi and Neg AC.  Nice little Debuffer.  Except, the snare aspect.  I love that it snares.  But Maybe make our snare null if the mob is already Snared.  Similar to the haste in VoV.  We still get all the other benefits,  but it wont counteract A's Quickening.  Largo's still having the debuff w/o the snare aspect if the mob is snared would be an benefit to a party situation.<P>Heh.  same old rant here.... Our Missing L49 Song.  *chuckle*<P>What is Verants intent with removing our mez'ing abilities,  and then adding a L53 song that isn't reliable as a mez tool.

</FONT><HR>I play a bard, level 38 at the moment. He is by far the weakest character I have ever played. His use is simple in any good group... he plays mana song between fights, twists 3 group buffs and melees during fights. That's it. No magic tricks, nothing fancy. One of those buffs doesn't include haste now... so I pick another.<P>If things go bad, he has the ability to pull out a few cool things. If an evac is called, I stand near the transport and play my AOE fear song. If the monster isn't running at least he is hitting me and not the porter...<P>If something is on the chanter or healer, I can try to charm it. It never really works, lasts no time if it does, but I have to say... that is the one best taunt I have ever seen. No warrior can taunt as well. I can usually live till the chanter gets a mes on the mob... usually.<P>If I'm running outside, I'm the fastest thing on two legs. Well except for shadow men it seems... but I've out raced Grimfeather to zone more then once. I'm fast enough, but I still carry JBOOTS! Why? because they are fast enough, work every time on a click, and allow me to twist one more song. Every little bit helps.<P>Is our mes useless, yes. I sometimes try to help lower level players break the orc camps in EC. I step in, safe in the knowledge that they cant really hit me, and play AOE mes. I can keep about half of them standing still... about half the time... and they are a good many levels under me? I know, I know, my charisma is ONLY 150... any self respecting twink would have a 200 right? It still helps the newbies, and I get the satisfaction that the orcs really can't hurt me.<P>All this and I still play a bard. WHY? I'll tell you why... I've NEVER had to spend even one second medding back mana... If I'm not dead, I'm ready to go. Even being low on hps doesn't matter really. You are trained by repeated deaths not to taunt monsters; so I rarely ever get hit in combat, unless I'm LOADING... please waiting my way to bind point. Then I get all my hps back... so NO waiting ever. You are always good to go!<P>Do bards need a fix or two... yes. The your song stops abruptly messages I've been getting lately that leaves me showing no song playing, but still getting the messages for a song, they are annoying. You basically have to zone, camp, die, or get bashed to change a song. If you can't twist, you are useless. If you can't stop a song for the pull, you are dead. This is a bad bug.<P>My forage skill is a waste. The cap makes it useless to bother with, I just buy milk and muffins. Its not worth the trouble.<P>My safe fall is nice. Its just the right level to keep me alive on most terrain at bard boot speeds... while slowly pounding my group to death that is following me. A nice feeling, if a bit self centered.<P>Tracking is good. Its skill capped at the perfect place. I've seen rangers who wished to have my skill cap. Why? The things on the screen are all near me. heh. I never wander to the wrong end of the zone past 3 simular monsters to get to the one I'm tracking. If I don't see it, its too far away to bother with.<P>Instill doubt? I swish about, look cool and scare a single monster once in awhile. Its almost usefull, in those situations where you are worried about the AOE aspect of your fear song. Most places however, the fear song is a better more sure thing. It NEVER gets used in a dungeon though, toooooo risky.<P>Dual wield... A nice touch. However, double attack would have been WAY easier to deal with. Why? they have about the same general effect on damage dealt to monsters. More or less... But with dual wield I'm forced to swap out 2 weapons for my instrument EVERY time I change. Not very smart really, I wonder why I did it that way?<P>So what would I like to see? Simple... bards need to have a "play" skill. When used, this button should stay down until released, and automatically cycle through the top 2... or 3... or 4 songs in the memorized song list. Automatically twisting for you. This would make all connection speeds equally as good. Ok, that takes a host side change as well as a client side one, so its likely not to happen. Well, if you make it client side only it won't help connection speed issues, but it will save me about 10,000 clicks an evening. Is that all that bad? Yes, I've heard all the... twisting is a skill remarks. Yes, I can twist 3 songs consistantly, and 4 on a good day with only a few drops. Am I happy I can? Yep. Do I want to make all those UNSKILLED bards just as good as I am? Yes I do, if it will keep me from the 10,000 clicks of torture I go through every night.<P>In closing... so this won't seem a total rant. I like my bard. Nerf him all you want,(I suggest that mana song not stack with clarity, that way I can play other songs too sometimes *hey its a joke! dont flame me for that :0*) I'll keep playing him and my friends will keep grouping with me. I like bards alot, but I do think there are things that can be done to improve the experience of being one...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Man what a whining thread. I get sad when i read this.<P>I play a level55 bard and ive got a few pointers.<P>* Bards ROCK! Even with all the nerfs Bards still ROCK<P>We have been weakened for a long time, from being one of the top class of this game to the middle but still very useful.<P>Its all in you mind, make it happen. You are expected to handle twisting, if you dont twist, then start another class.<P>Ive been playing a fairly long time and bards have an easier time than most to find a group, the one thing that really worries me is the fact that the charm song cannot be used on 51+ mobs and the mez song is basically useless because of the resist rate. Its not meant that bards should be able to mez as good as a chanter but still, one mob should be expected without any major hassle. Charm rocks but since im 55 now my mobs are starting to hit the cap. <P>That greatly reduces how useful a bard can be in a party besides the fact that i play manasong. So the things i would like to see is higher cap on the charm song (its balanced with the mana anyway consumption anyway) and a look into the resist rate of the mez songs. I have a cha of 155 roughly and even with a Shaman buff i usually get 3-5 resists in a row consistently on blue-green mobs. Thats distressing, only crowd control measures thats reliable right now is charm song, and ill have to ditch that in maybe one level.<P>Please look into resist rate on mez songs.<P>/Ranina Fyrecurls<BR>55th HUMAN Bard of Bristlebane<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sorry I don't agree..<P>I think bards are the best class before after and during 50 :P I have been one for 160+ days played. I fell in love with this class back in the beta days when I was a monk and a bard sang to me and my group and I became a Hurricane :P<P>I have since the patch and since after 50 used basicly the same songs, VoV, Chant of battle(level1 baby!) and then throw in what else i need. This is my set up for ballanced groups. The patch that *nerfed* hast (fixed it) does not effect me because i always loved the +ATTACK and +AC that VoV gave my group along with the haste effect. So have a chanter throw a better speed buff on ya it don't matter the 30str/agi still kicks some butt.<P>Watching: If a cleric/caster in your group think that your more effective playing mana song while the fight is on, they are idiots, pure and simple. 15mana a pulse of level 32 song is probably the most usless thing in the world in the 5 minutes the average fight lasts. There are some times when the wizard might have almost enough mana to EVAK and then maybe it would help.. but i only ran into that instance 1 time from when i got mana song 32 till i got 55 (that i just play all the time in my twist now anyway). For these people that think that your a mana battery, you just have to explain to them that their wrong and that the mana your giving them will in no way compensate for the buffs you could give the tanks. Course if your in a group full of casters that another story :P<P>Best trick... Tell them to med till they have 1 bouble of Mana left to get. Tell them to stand and use Jboots and watch there mana drop back to where it accually is (since bard song 32 has been bugged since i got it). This will wake them up to the fact that when they have full mana , they might still be a bouble down and accually only got 1/4 of a bouble while the fight was going on. That's not enough to even GH anyone, or cast a level 40 nuke. if that dont work just /rude and find a real group :P. A well ballanced group will always have need of a bard, because he enhances the abilities of every single other class in the game. I can't think of one group situation where anyone would say "ok one spot to fill what we want.. this bard is here looking for a group" and the response be "no we dont need a bard" onless that group allready had one  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> (or your a 1 song bard and everyone knows it :P)<P>After 55 you can sing the level 55 cantana and regen HP and Mana. And thats what i play during fights now as that accually has a use. And saves the cleric mana while giving them mana  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>As far as 50-55.. I soloed mostly as it was easyer then trying to find a group, and i needed some ME time  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Now im 56 and yes i have been at it for about 2 months.. its a nasty penilty but i think its well worth it.<P>~Tarzool 56 BRD TM</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Cool 2 positive posts. I am glad you guys are still enjoying your bards.  <P>I am sure you have heard by now they are planning a some fixes to the mez songs.  I still believe stacking of haste/slow is the most important issue atm, but that has not yet been addressed.  <P>I dont agree with you two, but I have said enough negative stuff, no need to rehash it. <P>I would like to say, I am not a one song bard by any means, I twist 3 songs all the time. I test my songs and song combinations every level and after every patch.  I almost wish I never parsed my logs.  I am sorry if I discourged any other bards at all, that was not my intent. Kaldivar is my Everquest personality, I just cant stomach flipping through my songs and not being able to find a working one worth playing.

</FONT><HR>OMG Bards totally are awesome post 50.<P>Anyone who tells you otherwise either hasn't played with a bard up that high, or has played with a bard that sucks... or played a bard too long =)<P>I am by no means a great bard, but I hold my own. Do we have a few problems? Sure, doesn't every class? But we add SOOOOOOOOO much to the group.<P>The most important thing is to *train* your groups as to what to do with bards along... then kick back and kick arse. <P>Bards can: <BR>pull karnors, seb (top level) and HS like no tomorrow (north and west) - least till you hit 51+ mobs.<BR>make the melee'ers more efficent.<BR>reduce downtime.<BR>make more exp for the same amount of play time with a bard.<BR>save everyone's arses (don't know how many times I have saved a group member by charming something that is beating the snot out of someone, buying the group time).<BR>crowd controll.<BR>be a mana battery if you have to (though I do this only when the **** is hitting the fan and we need mana bad). I then twist 32 and 55 songs with seven string lute. I do however tend to twist catana (55) constantly for my groups - they have been trained to pull in close and to sit close.... we are hardly ever oom... how could you be with Catana playing constantly?<BR>stun mobs.<BR>be backup to the group's member X who is dead or OOM... only thing we can't really do is evac and complete heal =) Even for evac we have invul song where you start singing and run like all heck and hope like all heck also.<P>I LOVE being a bard. We aren't perfect, but on a server where there is a massive shortage of bards, I can tell you that one of the complaints I hear all the time is, "why aren't there more 55+ bards?" (there are 3, two of which don't play anymore and I am the other) Answer is ppl give up, cause it IS hard, it IS tiring, and you DO have to think all the time. Everyone told me I would give up on my bard at level 20... /rude<P>I mean it can't be all bad, when you meet up to do a raid and just about everyone wants the bard with them, not just for mana, but for everything else they can do.<P>Don't write yourself off just yet.<P>Love<P>Paschendale Chanteuse<BR>Bardess<P>PS. Haste wise - our songs stack with haste items, but not with haste spells (eg. VoG). So I ask our group chanter or shammy - you want to haste or me? Most of us hit max haste with song and haste item, so why waste the mana from the chanter or the shammy when I can do for free? Also depends on what role I am playing for the group and whether we have someone who can up the stats for the melee'ers. If I am CC'ing then I cant keep haste, stats and catana going all the time. Just go with the flow, it all works out  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hate to say it, but bards are pretty useless post 40. If i have an enchanter, they can lay haste and clarity on the group that is always working, so even when a fight is going on and a bard would be playing haste and other things the clarity and speed buffs of the enchanter are working. Bard mezz? useless. charm? lasts no time (if successful), and the bard immediately gets beat on. There really is no reason to have a bard in a group except for resists on dragon raids or the like. The only really viable hybrids post 50 are paladins and sk, with sk being the only one actually better post 50. Rangers cannot take hits, bards don't really do anything well and also cannot take hits, at least paladins and sk can still tank.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just wanted to post on some of things said, i love my bard, she's level 60 and semi retired, i'm busy leveling and playing my cleric lvl 57 and wiz, lvl 45 now.  I can get a group still easier with my bard then eihter of my other two classes.  I think some of you are missing a key component to crowd control and that's your ability to pull single mobs the majority of the time at least as well as most monk can and break areas.  Anyone that played with me generally said and believeed that no chanter was needed.  Personally i liked the safety of an enhcanter in the group but did and do most camps without one when i can't find one.  You have charm mes and area slow for the the odd time your level 8 lull song is resisted and results in a bad pull.  That song isn't just for running through sol b unagroed , it works awesome for pulling and that's the needed component to make you effective at crowd control.  Practice a little it works, and you can pull if it's only one mob your getting, lull, then snare you'll be safely to camp, rarely ever getting hit.  <P>As far as your not a mana battery and cleric/enchanter don't need this mana,note my other class is a cleric and yea sometimes they really do need the mana, and i if say low mana and bard won't play it for me becuase they think it doesn't help, i'm not highly likely to ask that bard to group again, becuase it makes a huge differecne to get 7 mana plus my regen rate a ticn then just natural regen and yea that's a key reason you're wanted.  A good enchanter can keep 5 mobs messed and get mana back if you're playing full time mana for them and  i've been saved with this tatic in a bad pull many times, enchanter keeping the pull messed while group med's or if you were trained when low mana etc. So don't tell me as a cleric and wizzard that the mana you sing isn't necesarry, even having it beat in 1 in 3 in a regular setting is extremely noticeable on my cleric's mana regen.  They don't make it up they need it, not beating it could cost you that heal you couldn't figure out why it didnt come.<P>Bard is by far my most fun class, checking out the fixes today was awesome, we should be able to effectively mes 2 to 3 mobs with the higher levle mes now and a couple with lower if you flip fast enough and learn to target.  NO it's not easy, it's the most fun.<P>And yes, haste/mana for the well balanced group are gonna be what you play, but the group will kill more faster and safer with out running low mana etc and you have charm etc as back up, You should be pulling though, you're likely the most efficeint class for it in the group, learn to use all you have and you'll love your class, and people will love it back!<P>And yes we have alot of broken songs still but let's hope Verant continues to work on some of the issues we have, and learn to use what we do have best.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First off, let me say....i didn't read all your posts, I just didn't feel like it, but i got the jist.<P>1) all of you that are complaining, OBVIOUSLY don't have the faintest clue on how to play a bard. Sure you may be level 53, level 45, even level 38.<P>Me, i'm level 51....bards own. IF you know how to play a bard correctly.<P>1) before you group, let your group know, that bards can't crowd control as well as enchanters ....I can handle an extra monster on my own using charm long enough for the group to finish off the other one.<P>2) Timing is everything!!!!!. To the person who said hell no to charm cause it only lasts a few seconds...don't act stupid..time the charm so that you begin casting again when the charm wears off. That way you only take 1 or 2 hits before the charm recasts.<P>3) Bards are a mix up of almost every class, not just warrior/wizard/rogue. Does a warrior/wizard/rogue get track? no.... Bards get charm....an enchanter trait, haste song, resistance song, duel wield, forage, hide, pick lock, and many others.<P>3) you are only focusing on a small portion of the bard. raids) they don't work to well without bards....reason:<P>a) resistances...bards will add an extra 100MR, and 50 to the others....(just rough estimate)<BR>b) mana song....prior buffing, Mana song goes along ways.<P>4) the use of charm....how much does a bard suck, when he goes into burning woods, and charms a wurm that hits for 140 - 150, then proceed's to solo the giant fort??? Doesn't suck to baddly does he? what's that you say? the charm only lasts 5 seconds? who says you can't re-charm? Who says you can't keep selo's going while you re-charm? who says you can't stay out of the attack radius while you re-charm? <P>5) Verant won't allow Lull to be AE at high levels....and why is that? because It will be over powering. a bard can keep an infanite number of monsters under control for as long as he wants. If that doesn't spell over powering, then i dont know what does. <P>I agree, I wish a bard could AE lull as well as enchanters do.<P>I agree, I wish bards could have as much HP as a warrior<P>I agree, I wish bards had stronger songs<P>I agree, I wish bards hit as hard as warriors<P>I Disagree on the fact that you are giving up on bards. Bards are one of the best class's. I consider myself a master bard, While i am not level 60 yet, I am  level 51, almost 52. I take down things that other people the same level as me couldn't.<P>For instance,<P>Level 42 necro type NPC....we need to kill him for part of our Epic quest.<P>He blinds, he casts a poison based DD, he fears..he hits for 90.<P>I was level 51 at the time. and i asked my guild to help me out....they said they were buisy, Then i asked this level 60 wizard if he'd help.<P>Lvl 60 wizard says: You need at least a full group of 50's - 60's to take that guy out.<P>I couldn't find anyone to help me so what'd i do.<P>I went down a list of possible soulutions to killing this guy.<P>first.....fear kiting....couldn't get close enough without him fearing me.<P>second...charming tiny miller, sending him to do my dirty work....feared tiny....didn't work<P>third...charming him, then fearing him when it wore off.....didn't work, i couldn't keep fear on him.<P>fourth...Kept resistances up, and kept running in a single direction while using dots.....WORKED. Took me about 20mins of this, and he started running.<P><BR>Now tell me what other class has that many options when it comes to dealing with a problem? sure as hell not a warrior...or a mage....or a wizard....doubtfully a shamen.....maybe a druid...not a rogue or monk.....not a sk....<P>I've solo'd things Equal level to me by kiting...while it can be difficult, It's not impossible.<P>It makes me sick to hear people bad mouth the bard. I've played for 113 days as a bard, its my primary character, and the only serious charcter i have. I know how to use a bard. I love everything about the bard, the question is...do you?<P>Doofy &lt;level 51 bard of drinal&gt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Please excuse my spelling though <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> in anycase I made a woodelf bard last night... managed to tailor myself some full tattered leather amour. I absolutly love this class.  I made some minor mistakes... like playing chords of disonence next to a merchant when I first bought it... not knowing what it did... but that was a part of the fun. I am working on being able to twist 3 songs while meleeing, and its a blast. One thing Im wondering... Im thinking Im going to be an agro machine... should I keep my shield and sword when I ding 17? for the extra ac? or should I go with duel wield?  And how much more effective do the instuments make my songs? Also at what point should I stop meleeing and just music to be more effective? or is that situational? Thanks freind. Im glad to see a post that is far and not just a Bards suck! post. thanks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm a level 55 soon to be level 56 and I have over 170 days played with Keyes, my bard.  I love the class. But I agree with the posts that the lower level bards need more to make them desireable until you're an essential class in your 50s.<P>One way would be to boost the effectiveness of songs when an instrument is used.  Battle Chant and Anthems are prime examples if they were given proper boosts to just the meleeing classes that would rival Shaman, Enchanter and Cleric buffs in regards to AC, Strength, Dex, Agi and Haste.<P>A way to accomplish this would give bards the ability to make instruments thru item quests and enchantments found in the game or player made.<P>Since Verant has made us so weak in meleeing at lower levels by making the weapons that can really damage unavailable to bards, I say take away the use of weapons and make em obsolete by making bards use instruments more. <P>Reduce the experince cap too.<P>I've never seen anything that shows us bards why Verant thinks we're so uber other than the uninformed comments made by Abashi.  They seem to think we are all wizzards of song twisting. If thats what they want from bards then the guide book they publish should reflect this with a warning that typing skills are foremost and the equipment required (computer and internet connection) must be top of the line.  I started my bard with a 28kb modem and 200MHz IBM Aptiva with 64mb of RAM. Twisting songs near large scale objects was impossible as my frame rate would stop me in my tracks.<P>Fess up Verant your staff is unprepared to address the real issues which the average player of a bard sees every day we play.<P>Sure this latest patch fixed some songs but most of the fixes still make those songs second rate to useless in the real game uses.  Show us bards you want us by bumping our instrument skills and making uber instrumnets available. <P>We really don't want to compete with Enchanters for charming and mezzing at level 50 we want to be wanted for the package of songs and insrtuments we carry.  Let the other classes hack, slash and bash let us bards make them more effective.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I play a bard as well as my Wizard (and a rogue and several other classes).<P>I always saw my bard as being more rogue/ranger/Enchanter than warrior/rogue/wizard, after all a bard isn't even slightly a teleporting cannon.  At the levels I have played I have seen NO problems, I actually have thought of the Bard as being incredibly capable and an amazingly useful class to any group.<P>HOWEVER, that said, I see a path that I am walking that at level 28 is fine but in the future I see problems.  While a Bard makes every group happy with the things they do for everyone at once, even at level 28 some of the abilities I have are being replaced by other classes.  No, don't sing slow, the SHaman will do it.  No dont sing damage shield, the magician/druid will handle it.  No dont sing haste, the Enchanter will handle it.<P>This is a trend I see only continuing to get worse and worse.  Thankfully I still have plenty to fall back on, but as time goes on I really do see it being less and less likely that any one of my songs will be useful to sing to the group, and where people will want only one or two songs to ever be sung.<P>IF Verant made the songs stack on other abilities (my slow plus Topors Insects, my anthem plus Alacrity, etc) this would allow Bards to be very helpful for everyone in the group while not being overpowered.<P>After all, for over a year the haste system was messed up and there wasn't a problem.  Adding the 10% haste of bardsong to other hastes wouldn't be overpowering EITHER.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

This will take you to level 40 or so.<BR>7) level 40 hunt in dreadlands, You can use our level 39 charm song to kite drolvarge around, and use our level 30 & 38 dots. This will take you up to level 50.<P>How fast you level is dependant on how much time you spend on it. I myself have played 114 days.

No one has rejected anyone for the items they're wearing. Once you hit 50+, you can go camp imbrued in hate plain....i'm somtimes the only bard on a hate raid.

</FONT><HR>My contention is that with one song per level, there will always be something you can sing to help a group.  Even with a well balanced group, let say cleric, enchanter, warrior, wizard, rogue, there will be gaps your songs can cover.  MR songs always stack, as well as the damage shields. There are plenty of single target debuff spells that can free up a spell slot for someone else.  Going against uber mobs and the tanks already have 15 buffs?  You can drain mana from that uber caster to prevent the CHeal.<P>I don't doubt that playing a bard to high level requires incredible dexterity, patience, and lots of dying, but I still think bards have a lot going for them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I can't agree that Bards are a bad class, just that there are an awful lot of bad Bards out there. Few days ago, saw several shouts from a heavily twinked 28th level Bard saying 'group needs someone who can snare' doh.<BR>Saw another heavily twinked Bard chasing a mob down bellowing every 3 secs and ending up pulling a train, doh.<BR>Bad bards tend not to die in the way bad wizards do, they don't get ignored like bad healers do, they don't get screamed at like bad tanks do. They just give the rest of us bards a bad name.<BR>A bard can massively increase the effectiveness and efficiency of any group, especially those containing a tank or 2. Haste, plus slowing the mob (single mob, of course,or 2 if you intend to charm), and healing afterwards - hardly any downtime, go get the next mob. Breaking rooms through charm pulling, using charm during a fight to tip the odds, plus everything else positive that's been mentioned, Bards are simply awesome. I have achieved things with a couple of tanks that I've seen full groups of higher level characters not even dare to attempt. Noone has died grouped with me in the last 36 hours of play. My last great escape involved a warrior on about 20 hps with 2 mobs on her. Just charmed one, chained the other and kicked in Selo's to make sure. Easy. A well-played Bard is so incredibly effective it's a danger to game balance, I don't want to say any more in case Verant agree with me and decide to nerf us some more.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000262&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000262&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
