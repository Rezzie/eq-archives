</FONT><HR>Hi I am a long time player of EQ and was wondering if there is any way to appeal a GM's descison about my last name.  I have been having the name Bek`Drakken in mind for a lizard man since i found out that lizzardmen where comming with the expansion set.  I have made lvl 20 some time ago and have tried to put this name on my char.  The /surname copmmand wont allow it only A-Z can be used no spaces or `.  I have recently talked with annother player who had a ` in her last name and she said that a GM has to do it.  So after finaly getting ahold of a GM he said that the name Bek'Drakken sounds too much like The Dragon.  Wow I didn't think that this was like that at all.  I havent heard anyone complain that it sounded like that when talking with other players.  Anyway i would like to get this fixed or get a final answer from Verant.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>It sounds as if you may have gotten a newer GM.  I'd ask if he'd be willing to escalate the issue.  The name mentioned doesn't violate the naming policy in my opinion.<P>Here's the portion of the naming policy that applies:<P>"Note: Non-words like--D, Da, De, Di, El, Z, Za, Ze, Zi, L, Le, La, Li are unacceptable in cases where the name contains a normal word, as they are references to "The" and implicate a title, in both cases (e.g. D`Kval is acceptable where D`Basher is not)."<P><BR>-Gordon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Verant might want to make sure that's a policy that's being uniformly used.  On Rathe, I know someone who wanted the last name X'Treem and was told she couldn't have it (because of the apostrophe), but there's folks with apostrophes in their names--some named D'Basher or D'Ogre and similar.  <P>I've seen quite a few names (on Rathe and Tunare, among others) that obviously had to be amended by GMs, but that violate that policy.  Someone's not reading their handbook. ;D</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I have a question... when I turned 20, I tried to get the surname I wanted.  It, along with about 20 others, were rejected by the /surname command.  Finally I found one that worked.  But now I keep hearing that if the /surname command rejects your choice, you can just petition to have it done?  If I'd known that, I would have done so!  Now that I know about this, would it be okay for me to ask a GM whether or not I can have my surname changed to what I had originally wanted?<P>- Teramenor</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I'm a little curious as to why suddenly GM's are on a rampage to change last names?  Recently several of my guild members had their last names changed by a GM because their name made a phrase.<P>Whats wrong with that????<P>If the phrase is not offensive why is it a problem? This is suposed to be my fantasy Remember! And I rather enjoy seeing what some creative people come up with.<P>I hardly think its fair for a GM to change your name for that reason, considering I'm paying to play this game I should be able to call my Character whatever I want!!!<P>I think your getting a little carried away with trying to tell people what they can and cannot do!<BR>After all it is a Game!!! and if people are that offended by such things let them find another game to play.

</FONT><HR>Ok, I have several different views on this... I think of a character reaches level 50 with a "bad" name, let him or her keep it. I mean, the person has a friend base and having to tell every single one, even your distant friends that your name ahs been changed can be a pain. A good friend of mine had to change his name from Docsavage. Now, I am NOT too keen on that name, and I never have been. He has several times contacted both guides and GM's about issues, but his name has never been a problem... till a few weeks ago... *rolls her eyes* He is level 51 and has to chnage his name!<P>I also met a low level druid today: Moore Dudley... To me that is on the edge of what is allowed... However if you look at some of the names that go around, they are really offensive, yet they don't do a thing about them. I hope my Cley Moore won't be changed. (Bear in mind, I had no thought of that being her last name when I created her) But how about good ole Speedy Gonzales? Yes, he is on our server.<P>Cold_Heat, you just have to get a guide to give you your surname. I got my rogues, Te'Anare from a very nice guide, who had no problem with it sounding like Te'Anara, the druid GM in Surefall  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Noor</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

The head GM on my server gave me this last name  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif">  It still sounds like a fantasy name though so whats it matter.  <BR>People were often named by traits and acts performed. Even today's names still show that.  Names like Smith and Miller obviously originated from John the Smith/Miller. So I see no problem with D'Basher, especially for an ogre or troll.  Its a descriptive name, and thats what names were like in old times and fantasy.  <BR>I could see why Kiken De'Arsalot would be against rules becuase it is a phrase spelled wrong basically.  But ya know what...It is done in a way that is suiting for a fantasy name, many poeple dont even notice that is actually "kicking the ass alot." Its not really offensive and I LIKE IT AND WANTED THAT FOR A NAME!! I really doubt that would piss anyone off, and as long as it doesnt piss anyone off and maintains a fantasy genre then who cares.  <BR>I saw a guy with the last name of Nutswinger, and another with Nutsmasher!

</FONT><HR>Why doesn't Verant allow "The" in names anyway?  Maybe someone would like to have a title with that instead of a last name, for roleplaying reasons.  If you want to let people roleplay, at least let them name their character how they'd like.  I think that only copyrighted and strongly vulgar names (in nearly all languages) should be unacceptable.  If someone wants their character to be, say hypothetically, Narayan The Swift, Why should you stand in their way if it's not used?  I've seen a couple players get their names "specially" changed by GM's because of their better relationship with them -- And that's what is even more unfair.<P>my 2cp<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>If people want to be creative with their last names, that's fine.  It's the people who's FIRST names are bad that kinda ruin the experience.  Like the lvl 20+ druid I saw wandering one day named mylittlepony or something like that.  Or the dude who was all upset because a GM deleted his heavily twinked character who's name was "Iamreallyblack"  I mean, really people, get a clue.<BR>I find it amazing that people can get to lvl 20, 30, etc and still have names like this.  Maybe GM's should do a regular sweep of character names to check for this, because apparently there's no first name filter.  (Although I find it remarkable that there is a last name filter...I would think the first name would be more important to check on, no?)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Clearly this violates the current rule but he is level 54 and has been playing this game since first day live and was lvl 20 and had his last name more than a year ago. To change the name no is a very big disservice to him and does nothing but sow the seeds of discontent.<P>I am NOT pleased by the action taken by the GM who did this to him, he was reporting a bug and ended up getting punished for doing so. I can assure you that everyone in my guild will never report a bug or game abuse ever again for fear of bringing ourselves to the attention of a GM who just may find "something".
