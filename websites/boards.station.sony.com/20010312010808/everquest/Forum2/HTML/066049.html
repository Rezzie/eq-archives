</FONT><HR>My hat is off to you Verant. <P>You have accomplished what many people have tried in the past. You have managed to exterminate a group of the population with ruthless determination and efficiency.<P>What I speak of is something that has done more damage than plagues, wars, and "ethnic cleansing" in this game. The blind ignorance Verant has shown to the most *vital* class in the game astounds me. Do you realize that when you drive clerics to quit the game in droves that those that depend on them will be right on their heels?<P>In this past week I have watched some of my closest friends walk away from the game, not because of the players but instead because of the arrogance and presumptuous attitude which Verant clings to. This problem is not unique to Xev. Lately we have watched some of the most advanced players realize this and take a step back and walk away (Tigole, Furor).<P>What does that say to you Verant? Some of your most loyal customer base realizing that you do not give a damned about their happiness, but instead you would rather push your fetish of "The Vision" until the mass of stirring people wisen to your petty and trivial pursuit of "The Vision" and instead show you a new vision, "The Unemployment Office". <P>Lets take a gander at these problems as I see it.<P>1)Donal's Breastplate<BR>2)PoG/Quest Breastplates<BR>3)Heal agro<P>Starting with the Donal's Breastplate. I agree the item was originally overpowered. However when you realize this you have no one to blame but YOURSELF Verant. Complete heal has always been the standard for high level encounters, you should have known better before implementing it on a 16 second cast. So you bumped it to 30 seconds, fine, I still agree thats suitable. Ok ok! You tack on a buff which limits the amount of times a single target can be healed over time. Still I agree (Less ardently) but still acceptable change.<P>Moving on to the breastplates from Velious. They heal 300 pts every 6 seconds for 4 ticks as I understand them. That was a 1200 pt heal over 24 seconds with a 16 second cast time. Is it a good item? Heck yes. Is it an overpowering item? Heck no. Certainly not in the grand scheme of things. The owners of these breastplates are NOT in Sebilis and SolB day in and day out. They are raiding, fighting mobs with their respective guilds that are quading for 850, and fast! This is where I remember the qoute "If you can tank it for 30 seconds, you cannot be beaten" in regards to the Donal's BP. Hello? 850 X 4 every few seconds, no one on Norrath is tanking that for 4 seconds, let alone the 15 seconds the PoG BP heals, especially when you consider that it is only going to heal 1/4 of the hitpoints of a moderate tank. You need to realize these bp's are not being used in pickup groups for the most part, but instead for a convenience factor at large encounters. No more inbalancing as free nukes from wizard staves/robes, no more inbalancing than the huge stat increase melee FA's give, no more inbalancing than the free pet the magician epic gives. Now I look and cry at the Velious cleric BP's and watch the 60 second cast time for the same spell....sixty seconds. What does that accomplish I ask you! I have a cleric that I play as well, I can sit down and med for 60 seconds and get twice the mana the effect saves me. I would much prefer you make the effect: "Abuse via Nerf" so at least I know what I loot.<P>Lastly, and most importantly.... the agro healing. This is the true Auschwitz of Norrath for clerics. Their entire job in this game is to heal, keep their group alive. How can you expect someone to do their job when they know its a death sentence? Please do not tell me its mismanagement of agro/hate. Its effecting every "uber" guild as much as every lowly cleric in Unrest. Explain to me the problem of the game before you made this change? Were mobs not hard enough when you had clerics alive? Was it that you felt EverQuest was becoming to stale when you dont die 15 times a night?<P>What is the point? It is a simple question of motives. Are you trying to push people away from this game? Or just clerics? You took their duty, and then you made it unable to be fulfilled. I watched today as my best friend in EverQuest whom I have known since day 1 walked away from the game, and all his friends that play the game because he believes (as well as many others, including myself) that Verant is an Evil Empire that is bent on doing what they want, when they want, as they want.... instead of what most businesses do, what their customers want. <P>Continue on your present course and the clerics will be the first to go. Once the clerics are gone rest assured that the rest will not be far behind, including myself. I beg you to realize the ramifications of what you are doing to the game, the players, and yourselves all at the same time. <P>Nenja The Silent<BR>Baven Feiran<BR>Leader of Harmonium-Xev<P>PS: I leave you with the final thought. If you believe me wrong you only need to look around to the players and see what they tell you. Do not rely on your testing team, but the players themselves. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well and truly spoken.<P>It is as if the Live Team has one evil child and one good child. The evil child does bad things to the customers and the good child tries to do enough good to balance it out.<P>But if Verant was smart they'd realize that the only way to keep 200k+ paying customers in the face of this Summer's new MMOGs, is to put the evil child in a home where it cannot nerf the players, and let the good child loose.<P>Frankly, Verant's actions for the past year have been unfathomable. Bad design decisions one after the other. Reproachable customer service conduct from Scotto right down to the newest GM-Admin. It all adds up. If EQ has 200k+ paying customers when HORIZONS comes out in late 2002 it will have half that many after HORIZONS goes live.<P>If they want to keep even those, they better stop making such terrible design decisions now, and start reversing the mistakes they've made in the past. Clerics are just the tip of the iceburg.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Granted, I never saw us all in our senior years playing Everquest still, and I expect friends to quit and move on in life. I just never imagined it would be such a sharp cut in the center of the game for many. The magnitude of folks leaving now is something I couldn't have imagined and certainly wish wouldn't happen. <P>Baven has some solid points that I don't need to make note of again to take up more reading time.

I will be checking them out as they are released but I am not going to just dump EQ for the first "new guy on the block". It has a lot of good things but the  incredablt BAD decisions lately have left a permanent BAD impression about the staff and developers at Verant.<P>Despite my determination to not waste any more time on my Cleric it keeps coming down to "No Cleric, no Raid". If I don't play mine, nothing happens.<BR>You YOU want to play under these conditions? I sure don't.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Those discounting Baven's point are the ones who are clueless.<P>Take another game in testing, which has avatars whose combat and defense is partially mana based. After you reach about level 20, the only "zones" that give experience (I'm simplifying, you are looking for skill advancement too) are zones where you cannot regenerate mana. So you have wonderful zones with hard mobs but you can't kill them because you cannot get mana once you use it.<P>The point? The players are not exploiting, or trying to avoid having to use good tactics, and good balanced raid parties, they are not trying to put one over on good old Verant. They are simply trying to play the game and defeat these AI enemies. But when the developer takes away important tools of the trade from many Classes over time, the effect is cumulative.<P>Everquest is going to see massive enrollment drops this year. Mark my words. Flame me all you want, but wait and see. And they act like they own the MMOG marketplace still.<P>/boggle</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

EQ has a life of its own, they should stop changing the play style for the class.<P>i personally feel if you make it to lvl 60, every class should be god like in power, we earned it.<BR>it is a just reward. as it is, any lvl 60 caster can be owned by any lvl 51 mob, with the expansoins, we got supercharged mobs, but the relative power of each class went up just slightly. major game imbalance, and some class actually lost power and became useless for many aspects of the game.<P>                           Lebie of the Rathe<BR>                       nerfomancer 55 retired<BR>                         cleric now</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>For some reason Verant thinks clerics are overpowered.  Perhaps they are listening to the trolls who keep claiming that without a cleric nothing can be done.  I can accept that assertion only when it comes to the uber-mobs, because I have seen groups functioning quite well in almost all other circumstances without a cleric.<P>However, even if clerics are absolutely required for some things (as can be said also for enchanters, monks, rogues, warriors depending on circumstance), that is not necessarily an indication of raw power on the part of the cleric, but of the monsters the group faces.  Rather than diminish clerics to make other healers viable, diminish the monsters so that lesser forms of healing will suffice. Increasing heal aggro once you've done that will seem more balanced.<P>Anyway, clerics have had Unswerving Hammer of Faith nerfed to uselessness, Mark of Karn nerfed to uselessness, their high level breastplates nerfed to uselessness, healing aggro increased which is a huge nerf to Complete Heal, and the spell Celestial Healing hardly drops at all anymore.  <P>After doing all of this, Verant still cannot understand why clerics are upset, why many have given up the class, and why many have left the game.  They are generally silent on the issue, and when they aren't, they are uncontrite.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"pudding at level 29 you do NOT see it. Wait until you get superior heal and complete heal. Then start complaining"<P>WRONG!!<P>This is the problem that old school clerics have.  They were used to the way things worked.  It was relatively easy to them.  They had tools to help them do the job more efficiently.  Almost any cleric is a fanatic about mana efficiency.<P>Verant changes the healing aggro, the cleric  status quo if you will.  This upsets that comfortable niche they have been in.  It affects some high level mobs more directly than everyday exp mobs.<P>My cleric is level 45.  I cast CH routinely in all kinds of situations without getting beat on.  I am a new cleric, and I love it.  My cleric is not high level yet, so I don't know of the problems spoke of for the high level game first hand.  But since I never knew of the problem, it won't be a change for me - it will be a challenge.  Perhaps the challenge will be to great.  I don't know.  Somehow I doubt it.<P>The vocal cleric minority has really blown this one out of proportion.  So much so that they have most of the posting community convinced the high level game is completely busted.  It is not, true it has some problems, but Verant is going to address those when they have explored the ramifications of the 'fixes' and can properly implement them.<P>Until then, I imagine the old world clerics will leave in droves.  And you know what?  Good.  Bye.  See ya.  The new clerics will gladly take your place.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What people should look at is, Baven is a rogue, not a cleric. This is not a selfish post asking someone to fix their class, he's asking Verant to fix the game. <P>Our guild is killing exactly the same uber mobs after the nerf, as before the nerf. Baven is worried about other guilds, not only on our server, but on others, that are having extreme problems with the nerf. <P>What's making people quit is the cleric agro. Why? Because, a clerics job in every single RP anyone has ever seen, is to heal. Thye're taking heal away from the healers, ridiculous. <P>1st, they phased out charm and mes on the enchanters, so now, enchanters don't enchant mobs anymore. Change the name to something else.

</FONT><HR>I have played a cleric since March 19th, 1999.<BR>I currently have my cleric, Florian Cathar, Templar of Mar, on Xev, having moved from Povar.<P>I have always had other characters, most notably an Iksar monk and a Barb warrior.  But I always come back to my cleric.  Why?  I guess I like it, like playing that class.  I like the role.<P>As a cleric, I have always spent the majority of my time meditating, healing and buffing.  For me the challenge has not really ever been killing the next big mob, but rather, managing my mana and timing my buffs so that my group is ready, and of course timing my heals for maximum efficency but still with in the limits of acceptable risk.<P>It's always been this way, the entire two years I've played a cleric.<P>Sure, there are times when you nuke some undead.  And if you are really playing below the groups level you might actually hit something with a stick.  But mostly, always, playing a cleric is about mana managment.  Medding, healing and buffing.  Timing.<P>At no time in the game has playing a cleric been what I would call easy.  Now, with the new agro, it is not only tedious, repetive, detailed work that is very difficult and challenging play well, but our main personal reward for playing this class is pretty much history.<P>That warm fuzzy feeling you get when you know you just pulled somebody's nuts out of the fire.<P>I've always judged a "good night" to be any raid or extended camp where no one in my group died.  The Planes .... well, folks always die in the planes, I don't care how good the cleric is.  Always been that way.  You expect it.<P>Happyness occurs when reality exceeds expatations.<P>Now, you got to remember that all a cleric ever gets in defensive skills is dodge, and it caps at 25.  Or 50.  I forget but it's a tiny figure.<P>So clerics have plate, full E Mist on a human cleric comes up around 900 ac.  And they have dodge, but it caps at a point as to be useless against upper level mobs.  And something like 2500 hit points.<P>So clerics have very, very little ability to deal defensivly with upper level mobs, and die very fast to them.  Out of line fast.  Stupid fast.  Boaring fast.  Defensive skills of a level 20 against the damage skills of a level 50+ mob.  It's really imbalenced.<P>Clearly, high level mobs agroing on and attacking clerics, in preference to all other classes, was never meant to be a feature of the game.  Not in any long term, planed, sense.<P>I won't even go into the negitive aspects of a dead cleric to the game enjoyment of six players.<P>I'll just say that it appears to me that a short term adjustment in fundamental game play was done to counter-act a arguablely exploitable situation, and as a result, the very nature of a class was profoundly changed for the negitive both in game play and in terms of emotion.  With no positive side to it, that I can see.<P>The biggest effect to the most people, as I can tell, is to make for even more long, tedious, extended, periods of down time getting organized or re-organized.<P>That is not really the kind of change the game needs.  There were other, better, ways to address exploit concerns.<P><BR>Florian Cathar<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

In fact, more power would be a bad thing."<P>this is thier justification to all the nerfs, not that they are some nazi hit squad.<P>though most of the cleric community that post disagrees with thier opinion of the cleric class being powerful and balanced.  they continue to design the game around thier OWN opinions,  which in turn is driving clerics to start new charactor or quit the game entirely.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'll wager that for every "high level" cleric that is gonna just walk away because of the injustices imposed upon them by the evil VI there will be a newbie cleric just joining the game to take their place. Many of those clerics that do quit will most likely just create a new character of a different class (one they perceive as being better) and continue to play EQ. Those who just up and quit EQ altogether will be replaced by those people completely new to EQ who just bought the game, are starting their first character, and choose to be Clerics. Those new clerics will be unaware of how the evil VI has supposedly ruined the game for clerics because they will learn how to play their character under the existing constraints. They will in other words be "nerfless" Clerics. <P>Why do I feel this way? Because it is true. Because EQ is still selling the full version (w/Kunark now) in retail stores. When EQ is no longer ordered and shelved by the big software retailers then that will signal the decline of the online population due to lack of sales of the new product. It will take considerably longer for the existing customer base to be reduced to a level where Verant/Sony takes the game out of service entirely.<P> I play on Luclin regularly and have done so since the server first came online. The nightly server population count runs over 2000 each night during prime time which tells me people aren't leaving en masse as is purported in these forums. The population has steadily increased since its initiation. I have said it before that when you see Verant merging servers instead of adding new servers then you will know the customer base is declining.<P>As for all the people who can't wait for the next generation MMORPG to come out so they can bail out of EQ, all I can say is we'll have to wait and see what happens. Eventually there will be a game that comes along that will capture our hearts as EQ did. Whatever that game is, it will not be perfect, it will not be everything that EQ is not. In fact it will be similar in scope with a few enhancements which will be the result of an improved or completely new engine. I will predict right here and now that regardless of the game that comes along the developers of that game will suffer the rants and ravings of its customers when they make game changes just as VI has. That company will also have the same people who are so vociferous here, telling them how they can't wait until the next game comes out so they can leave the evil ones and move on to the "perfect game".<P>It's still just a game. Enjoy it!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I will have to quit my cleric as well.  It is a shame as I started him only recently.  True Baven's comments contain a sense of the holocaust, but the underlying truths are for certain.  Clerics have become somewhat useless.  I use to shout for them all the time to get into a group.  Now I see Paly's getting invited over clerics (at least some Pal's can handle the aggro).  <P>Verant does not do these things to deliberately upset its customers.  It does them to force people to play longer.  If it takes you longer to level because you die 200 time more often now, the strategic assumption is that you will keep playing longer.  Or, perhaps you will start a new character that is not currently being "nerfed."  They want you to kepp playing.  They know most of us will.  This tactic is not too bad, but will be tough to continue when the 35 new MMOG are released this summer.  By then, perhaps they will be ready to shut the doors on EQ and  focus on Star Wars.  Either way they have us hooked.  Customer Service and Player Needs are not words in Verant's vocabular.  Rather:  Strategic Revenue generation.  Maximization of profit from monthly fees.  Continuous creation of new characters.  All of these goals lead to money.  Making clerics happy is not something that will lead to more revnue in Verant's opinion.  My hat is off to its strategy department.  Cheers</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Baven, <P>While I understand your sadness in having friends you have known for 2 years log off that final time, imagine the depth of the sorrow of the person who left and how bad it must have gotten for a person to abandon a "persona" they have lived for 2 years. It is never easy for a dedicated Cleric (or any class I imagine) to hit that "Cancle Account" button and leave behind the friends we make in this virtual world.<P>You say Verant is systematically eradicating Clerics... I happen to agree with that. I AM a Cleric and in the past few months Verant has done more to damage the playability and enjoyment of being a Cleric than I ever though possible. I can honestly say I never ever thought Verant would so totally destroy a class at the higher levels and certainly never a class that was so excrutiatingly boring to play in the first place. It takes a special person to be a good Cleric... Verant has seen fit to make sure even those individuals can no longer tolerate these massive changes in the name of the "Vision".<P>My very first toon was a Druid (oh so long ago) and while I found it intersting it simply wasnt my style. I settled on a Cleric soon afterwards and while the class had many restrictions I found the trade-off to be fair. I could no longer port, or SoW, or Snare... but in return I was a better healer at higher levels, better buffer at higher levels and eventually I would be the SOLE class that could return experience. Yes, it was a very narrow place Clerics had... but once again the trade-off was acceptable.<P>Then came Kunark... I eagerly awaited for the new spell lists to be announced as did most caster classes.... I was slightly disappointed but overall I was happy with the "balance" of the classes additions. While Kunark wasnt terrible for Clerics as a whole it wasnt quite what most of us had hoped for... some of our spells werent working correctly (Death Pact that works 1 out of 300 casts is a good example) but we the Clerics were MORE than willing to deal with it.<P>Kunark was the beginning of the end of Clerics tho... shame most of us didnt recognize it earlier. Remember Mark of Karn? I dont mean the watered down version we have now but the "original"? It actually gave Clerics something to do besides the sit/heal/med routine and we LOVED it. We could now positively contribute to the group with a spell that wasnt a heal or a buff... Clerics rejoiced !! Then someone decided that MoK was "too powerful" since Hybrids didnt get as much benefit from it and it was nerfed to the point that the ONE spell Clerics were happy to get now sits unused on page 50 of most spellbooks.<P>The MoK nerf was the beginning of the end for us.... Verant had focused their attention on Clerics as a whole and began re-evaluating the class spells and armor spells as a whole. Had we known than what we know now I'm confident Clerics would have spoken out much louder.<P>Then came Velious.... while I was mildly dissapointed with the new spells in Kunark I was horrified at Velious.... DRUIDS get a better group buff than Clerics did?!?! Since when were Druids the "Masters of Group Buffs"? Group buffing had always been Clerics and Shamans domain but now not only was it being handed to Druids they were being given BETTER buffs than we had. PotG is a level 60 Druid group buff that adds a hitpoint regen AND a mana regen component.... NO CLERIC HAD THAT. The "best" buff Cleric has is Aegolism...  lvl 60 SINGLE target 700 mana 10 plat spell that added no regens... while useful for very high end encounters (provided the mob doesnt dispell it) for the "average" player PotG is far superior to Aeoglism. PotG mana regen stacks with Clarity, Clarity 2, Group Clarity and Bard Song Clarity... who whouldnt want that?<P>The Donals BP fiacso broke the hearts of many Clerics... an item they had worked so very hard for was destroyed beyond anyones imagination... it is no longer a desirable item for Cleric. Supposedly THE Class defining armor in Kunark is now nothing more than a cruel joke.... those Clerics who have the misfortune of owning one of these are reminded daily of how poorly Verant has treated them. If my guild tries to give me one I'll simply hand it to the first newbie Cleric I find... perhaps THEY can find a use for it because I certainly cant.<P>The Plane of Growth and quested BPs are much the same as the Donals.... useless beyond anyones comprehension. A 1 minute casting time on a spell that heals 1200 hps over 24 seconds? Whats the purpose? I cant cast this spell to powerlevel a lowbie (spell is too powerful for your intended target).... I cant possibly keep a tank alive with this unless we're fighting orcs in WC... and even without any form of Clarity I can med back the mana faster and just cast it myself. These BPs had NO IMPACT on the high-end game but Verant devastated the Cleric class as a whole in the name of "balance". Once again a lot of Clerics are left with a useless item they get to look at on a daily basis to remind them just how badly Verant has treated them.... and for those people who hunted in PoG they now have the added bonus of ruined factions on top of it.... talk about adding insult to injury.....<P>Heal Agro .... well... I'm not going to discuss just how bad it is in the high end game... lets just say I lost 2 bubs of exp in lvl 59 from this "balancing"... and yes... I KNOW how to manage agro... it's how I stayed alive BEFORE the change.... after the change it was irrelevant... Healing=Dead Cleric.... perhaps Verant has seen the light and will change it back but somehow I doubt it. I suspect it will be tuned back slightly and called "fixed" and the Dev Team will pat themselves on the back for a job well done.<P>Class Talk Threads... hmmm... Clerics asked for something to remove the monotony of sit/med/heal we got Hate List Agro Nerf. Clerics asked for "something... anything" to ease the often long and dangerous runs we do to go Res fallen friends.... we got an Undead DoT (laughable at the level obtained and utterly useless 4 levels later). Clerics asked for Group AC Buffs.... Druids got 2 of the Cleric core spells (yeah... this one baffled me too). Clerics asked for some form of self-invis or at the very least for invis potions to be stackable... Wizards got Invis to Undead (another one that baffles me).<P>I suppose the Cleric Epic will be next to be "balanced". Lets see... a 5 min casting time and just for fun lets give it a set number of charges... or perhaps Verant will see fit to reduce it to Revive. Considering this is the LAST item Cleric have left that hasnt been "balanced" I imagine it wont be long before we see a cute little message from Absor explaining to us WHY this MUST be balanced to save the game.<P><BR>Verant... if you're listening... just give Druids Complete heal and the lvl 56 Res spell and be done with it. Stop chipping away at us and do it in one fell swoop. It will be far less painful for Clerics as a whole than this ripping us apart a little bit at a time.<P><BR>Naelya<BR>lvl 59 Cleric<BR>Foundation Rathe<BR>The Rathe<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/066049-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/066049-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/066049-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/066049-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/066049-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/066049-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=066049&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=066049&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
