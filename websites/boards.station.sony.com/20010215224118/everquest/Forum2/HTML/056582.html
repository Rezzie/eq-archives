The idea is to look at the things that need to be changed to make the class 'balanced'. With that as the primary goal, I am still interested in hearing about bugs and other such things. But, primarily, I want to talk about balance.<P>My take on the rogue is pretty similar to that of the warrior. They are pretty well balanced. Obviously with EverQuest as a primarily player vs. environment game, some of the things that thieves traditionally do are not really part of the package. That's why, in EverQuest, they are titled rogues.<P>Again, I have had little time (actually, no time at all) to do research on rogue concerns before starting this thread. So please be as detailed as you need to be to get your point across. But, at the same time, please remember that this thread will get long. So being concise and readable is important too.<P>I do want to report one thing that we have already discovered internally about rogues that is broken and will be fixed when we make these changes. Yes, it is a nerf, but not in the true sense of the word.<P>In the old days, NPCs had a limited size to their hate-list (basically the way that they track who they are angry at). In those days, evade would just drop you to the bottom of that list. Recently we increased the size of that list dramatically. This allows us to do a lot more with NPCs. But evade was never changed to reflect this, so it still drops you to the bottom of the hate-list. Essentially, this allows a rogue to do significant damage to an opponent, and then with the use of evade, become less 'hated' than someone that has done no damage to the NPC at all, but just has a somewhat negative faction with that NPC and is standing someplace on the other side of the zone. The rogue can then beat the NPC up with impunity. Basically, evade is far too useful for avoiding aggro from an NPC, and we're going to change it to be more in line with its original function.<P>I wanted to let you know that at the outset. Please don't make it the focus of this thread. It’s certainly something we should talk about. But there are certainly other things that are worth discussion as well.<P>So let's hear what you think.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Seriously, I really do not think anything should be changed with the rogue class.. unless as previously stated, I would like to see track.. but thats my opinion, and one that is unlikey to come about.<P>I do believe the old adage 'If its not broken, dont fix it' applies here.  Somehow you clearly think Evade needs tweaking, but at the moment it works perfectly.  After an evade it doesnt take too long for a rogue to be back on top of the hate list, as it stands with your proposals we will most certainly be at the top of the hate list almost all the time during a fight.  That coupled with the fact that combined with 'unsuccessful' evades, we ARE going to be dying a lot more than we currently do.<P>You fixed us once to make us a viable and wanted playing class, in a time when a rogues life was hard and we were laughed at throughout Norrath by other class's, please dont begin to put us back in that same scenerio.<P>However, it seems that our concerns are falling on deaf ears.. ok you are changing the 'formula' on how this 'nerf' will work constanlty but thats not we are telling you.  Evade I think  on refelcetion doesnt need nerfing (tweaking), I already get beat on enough when grouped even with successful evades because Backstab will ALWAYS put me right back on top of the hate list, and when im being pummled and im being pushed back from the mobs hits, evade most times just isnt possible to get off throught the hide and move effect.<P>If your not going to do anything to enhance us more, then please leave us alone  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Yes, please, just leave us alone as much as you can.  Forget most of the wish lists (I still can't believe some of those were suggested - but the soul-bound lockpicks and more masks are GREAT quest ideas!  Everybody likes toys!), but don't goof Evade.  I hear somewhere (can't remember where or when... but it was recent and applied to this dicussion) about a 500-hate-reduce minimum set of calculations for Evade?  That was a great set of numbers.  Stick with that.<BR>I think Absor might've posted that...<P>In any case, thank you for your consideration.

</FONT><HR>Since it appears you are already set on having this nerf, I ask that you don't make the change so drastic at first.  The rogue builds hate fast and if he drops to only 2 or 3 in hate list he will be right back on top in no time, making rogues want to backstap less and maybe even turn off attack to wait for aggro to build against others.  If you change it, make the aggro drop almost as much as it does now, just not quite as bad.  The change you are proposing is way too drastic.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Check out evade YOURSELF, IN GAME, on a LIVE server before you make any changes.  Evade DOES NOT work the way you think it does.  This will be BLATENTLY obvious to you if you TRY IT YOURSELF.  PLEASE LOOK BEFORE YOU CHANGE THIS.<P>I cannot stress this enough.  It's clear that our words won't change your minds, so please try it yourself.  At worst, you've wasted an hour.

</FONT><HR>Evade only works if you have a PC who can tank well.  It doesn't work with pets who taunt, it doesn't work if the warrior or whatever doesn't taunt, it works ONLY if someone taunts, and not even all the time then.  You pretty much have to turn auto attack off, hit hide, and WAIT for the warrior to taunt.<P>All rogues want is stackable poisons</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree.  Rogues and warriors were finally close to balance, and Verant decides to nerf the rogue.<P>The evade nerf is more likely a reply to the "nerf rogues" threads than it is a reaction to the new length of the hate list.<P>If not, they wouldn't even be talking about dropping the rogue to 3rd on the hate list after an evade; they would be talking about making sure that evade puts the rogue into the 6th through 10th spots.<P>Now lets get back to things that will help balance rogues.<P>If evade is not nerfed as they have stated, I'd just say a few things.<P>First, give rogues a poison resist on the same level scale as the warrior's magic resist.  MR is more valuable than PR anyway, so there is no reason to do this.  Both of these classes are pure melee, as are monks, so this is certainly fair.<P>Second, allow more rogue usable slashing and blunt weapons to be used in the secondary hand.  Many of these weapons are lore anyway, so that would keep them from being duel wielded as it is, and after all, rogue train with slashing and blunt weapons in their off hand.<P>Third, allow hide/sneak through zoning.  If invis can do it, so could hide/sneak.<P>If the evade goes through as planned there would be other things.<P>The first would be to reduce the nerf on evade.  Yes, the nerf would then become the most notable issue to unbalance rogues detrimentally.<P>If this is not done, then rogues will need the same hit points as a warrior.  If Verant want rogues to take hits, they better be willing to allow rogues to take the hits.<P>There are many players of other classes that just do not understand the disadvantages rogues have.  They do not see the low hit points or the poor damage ratio weapons.  They do not see the lack of plate bearing armor classes and armor class bonuses given to tanks.  They do not see the lack of spells or lack of built in magic resists. They see nothing but a high damage backstab, and they are blind to all else.<P>Oh yes, there are those who say that evade should not be as powerful as Jolt.  They do not understand that Jolt is a bandaid to patch up a rather large hole in the vision of a ranger.  Only an idiot would start a ranger now after having all of the fact.<P>Is that where we all want rogues to be: a class of idiots?  There is nothing balancing about that.<P>Quisp<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It's me again!<P>Evade works nicely for me, always has.  I don't play around in Velious a lot... big open spaces unnerve me...  too many druids and necromancers thinking they can fear kite the entire zone...  *thinks*  My point.. was.. oh yes!  No complaints about old-world Evade here, but in full groups you DO need to be dropped to the bottom of the hate list.  If, say, you're in a group that isn't tank-heavy you're going to need everything - EVERYTHING above you on the list.  With taunts recycling on tanks that have it the casters can be safe, but as a rogue you run up that list quickly.  Four hits and a backstab and you're on top again, and it's just about time for another Evade.  Failing your Evade works twice, you're being pummeled and avoiling touching the Backstab or Pick Pocket (if you use it at all) until you can land an Evade and get the bugger mob offa you.  Taunt is only icing on the hate list cake, it's all about Evade.  And there's no room for taking hits off of 50+ mobs - ever.<P>Just find some way of keeping Evade constant with the old-world, I think that'll be.. fine.  Yes?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>And so again, on my never ending quest..<P>Evade: Please listen, evade is not foolproof as it's being made out to be.  It is not 100% and has many problems (moving, lag, getting hit, etc).  I will agree with you on the status of large raids and evade, however any rogue can tell you this: YOU ARE ABOUT TO KILL EVADE.  Many are now siding with the 33% list reduction rather than the "top of the hate list" theory because it's the lesser of two evils.  The top of the hate list one forces rogues to the absolute top of the list (god forbid there's multiple rogues), and makes grouping a disaster with a smaller hate list.  Also, WHY compare evade to jolt?  Evade is supposed to be far better than jolt, because jolt was a quick fix for rangers.  Saying that evade should be just as good as jolt concerns many of us.  And what about "My take on the rogue is pretty similar to that of the warrior"?  Rogues and warriors are opposite styles of melee.  Warriors are heavy buffed fighters who are built for tanking, while rogues are stealth fighters built on doing higher damage (being assassins) but NOT being a tank ever.  Warriors fight up front, rogues from the rear (requires less aggro, if you didn't know).  Just a bit of rogue 101.  I don't believe that current evade drops us as far down as stated (many times in groups evade drops the enemy off and he comes back 2 seconds later /boggle).  Sometimes it's so bad I have to stop fighting altogether to really evade, IN CURRENT FORM.  This new deal will force rogues to sit out most of the time, making it a pointless class.<P>Just another point:<BR>Poison is not useful because it doesn't stack.  Hide/sneak is dangerous due to zoning/LD (which makes no RP sense, and LD more common in Kunark and Velious).  Rogues see these as they are, BROKEN.  They're an obvious problem when a majority of the rogue community points it as a problem.  However, the average response is, 'we don't want to code it, we don't care enough'.  That is the general response we receive, or are ignored on the issue.  If we didn't argue about this, and just had the coders DO the code I bet it wouldn't take long.  They're paid to do it anyway.  This isn't about giving us uber 1000k backstabs or flying ability, these are simple playability issues.<P><BR>This is ROGUE TALK.  A dialect between Verant and the rogue community.  It would be nice to have a bit more of a discussion rather than our suggestions going unanswered (and I mean the real issues) and have Verant walk all over a class that knows what's right and wrong with the current issues.  As someone stated before, we play this class day in and day out.  We know the problems, we present them, but don't blow us off.  Make the dialect happen.  Thanks again.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>As a lvl 52 rogue and after playing since release with other classes..my rogue was born in nov of 99 and I had other rogues before then. Evade when it first came out did work to well. That was quickly discovered and then nerfed "tweaked" to not drop as low. I have trouble evading at the 50+ range alot of times and I have never evaded and aggroed someone on the other side of a zone...impossible scenerio unless only 2 of you in the zone. I will definitly test it out but Gonna be hard to find a zone with just 2 people. <BR>Tweak evade if your set...but then I demand the impossible to, make hide/sneak impervious to all but boss mobs and dragons on the 50+ range. Because with your "adjustment" I will need to CR alot more.

</FONT><HR>I am going to make the call again for Questable / no drop status for the midlevel Rogue only armor currently Ravenscale but there could be a new class of armor.  Absor has mentioned that this is not a balance issue, but if we are unable to get our class armor and other classes are than this is a balance issue.  Also if the evade change takes place Verant admits the rogues will be hit more, if we are hit more we need an increase in AC, the best way to increase AC without changing our base is adding new armor.  Hence a new class or Questable or No Drop Rogue Only Armor.<P>reilmb</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>.<BR>.<BR>.<BR>I am not going to take time to talk about the evade subject its been talked about enough<BR>.<BR>.<BR>Just want to bring up up a couple things mentioned before and that need to reiterated. They are small tweaks that make sense and are not a problem to implement.<P>*The Sense Trap Skill needs to be looked at. With the implementation of new traps in velious this skill has become something in the rogue arsenal that can really be put to use. The problem is that the "sensing" radius of the sense traps skill is tiny. This coupled with the fast the the recycle time of about 5 or 6 seconds makes this skill almost worthless..better to spring the trap and deal with it rather spend 20 minutes in a tiny area trying to sense a trap.  <P>--The Fix: Increase the sense trap radius by a good amount and drastically lower the recycle time . Sense Traps is a skill that you should be able to use on the fly while dungeon crawling, not sense, wait 5secs, take a step, sense, wait 5 sec, etc etc.. I would like to see this as something that I can click constantly in a strange dungeon, if something turns up I can yell stop and proceed to disarm without having to seriously slow down my group.<P>*Poison resist: Being masters of poisoning and poisons you would naturally think that our poison resist would gain in power as we gained in level. Somebody that handles poisonious snakes all their life stands a much better chance of surviving the poison than somebody who does not. <P>--The Fix- give us 1pt of poison resist a level. warriors get magic resist, give us poison. not much to ask<P>&gt;<BR>.<BR>.<BR>.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor said:<BR>"Essentially, this allows a rogue to do significant damage to an opponent, and then with the use of evade, become less 'hated' than someone that has done no damage to the NPC at all, but just has a somewhat negative faction with that NPC and is standing someplace on the other side of the zone. The rogue can then beat the NPC up with impunity."<P>This is just plain wrong. Perhaps in theory this is what you predict, but play with a rogue or play one, and you'll see how funny this statement is.  Evade works EXACTLY how it should, albeit sometimes it fails even when the skill succeeds. The rogue is always just one hit below the person taunting, IF evade is successful, and the rogue doesnt get knocked back / moved while attempting to evade.  The bit about a mob running across the zone to someone else, before the rogue, is just too funny. I group regularly with a warrior, monk, and rogue. If the warrior is not using fast weapons and taunting and keeping close proximity to the mob, EVEN with the rogue evading, the rogue will get hit, and often. Over the course of the fight, the mob will choose the rogue over myself, even after me snaring and dotting the mob. <P>I'll echo what a previous poster said: Please try this on a LIVE server with a REAL rogue, and you'll see what we're saying is true.<P>Starrfall<BR>Druid 51 - Tholuxe Paells</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I'm getting the feeling this is just one of those things where the Dev team thinks something works one way, it's SUPPOSED to work one way, but that's not how it works...<P>For example, in my group last night, I was with a troll warrior.  If I had bothered, I could have taken more than a dozen screen shots in a period less than two hours of me SUCCESSFULLY EVADING, then leaving attack off (to make a point to myself if noone else), and then being beat on for quite a bit afterward before it finally taunted off.<P>Evading does not lower aggro of a rogue to that of an innocent bystander.  I have absolutely no clue where you got that one.<P>We are not rangers or wizards.  Stop comparing it to Jolt or Concussion.  We need this skill the way it is or we won't be effective in the game anymore.<P>Why are you even bothering to change it?  I ASBOLUTELY don't understand this.  Rogues aren't "obscenely powerful".  People aren't whining about us being too strong.  Sure, go ahead and change the cleric bp, that's unbalancing.  Evade is NOT.  This change serves absolutely no purpose but to ruin a perfectly good class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>     I think the point that I and many others are trying to make is that we were and are perfectly happy, or close to, with the rogue class.  The changes and enhancements you made were wonderful and we applaud you.  <P>     Now you are changing something and it has alot of us rogues scared.  I for one don't know what the effects will be, all I know is that your making evade less efficient then it really is now (right now it isn't as efficient as you believe it to be).  <P>     I'm not very good with numbers, and although this 500 minumum sounds nice and all, I just don't believe it is enough.  If right now when I supposedly get dropped to bottom of hate list when I evade and then 3-5 seconds later I am back at the top, then it definately is not enough.<P>     The point I am trying to make is and I think I speak for alot of others here is that evade isn't as efficient as you and the testing staff think it is.  Never once have I seen what you explained happen, and even with evade now I have a hard time getting and keeping mobs off me.  And I am level 52, just about 53.  <P>     Be fair Absor and staff, take our advice, be fair. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hmmm, I think evade should be the *only* topic of discussion on this thread.  There is a proposed change to evade on the table that will force Rogues to perform like half-rate warriors or half-rate monks.  Half-rate Warriors if you decide not to hold back your hits, and tank with 1/2 as much HP and 3/4ths as much AC.  Half-rate Monks if you decide to hold back and end up doing just as much damage as the Monks.  No feign death (hey, doesn't that reduce hate 100%?), no mend, 2x more solo-ability on Monk, and nearly identical in terms of HP and AC.<P>I wouldn't mind having "Feign Death" replace our Evade skill ..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It makes me think when people point out that their druid or that their necro is a lot easier to play, how balanced is rogues really as a class.  Playing a rogue is IMHO one of the most challenging chars to play.  This is especially true if you play one totally untwinked. I haven’t been able to solo anything greater than a low green since lvl 15.  I think that the increased challenge of playing a rogue also increases the personal rewards of leveling this unique class.  <P>The ideas that players have been coming up with to improve this class are very interesting.  I would even like to see some of them implemented.  Many of these suggestions are unique and good.  A lot of what is being suggested I don’t even think would raise a balance issue.  I mean how could holding hide/sneak across a zone unbalance the classes?  Granted, some are outlandish.  No way should we be able to get a bonus for a front backstab (I’ll take it though).  <P>Point being, there are many things that you can add to this class to make it easier and more fun, that wouldn’t diminish the other classes.  But instead all that I’m hearing is nerf.  I’m not even sure that the nerf is needed.  If you find something that works for this skill at all lvls, fine.  But please, throw us a bone.  Increase safe fall, make at least a token improvement to the poison system, increase the number of rog only toys, make Ravenscale NO DROP.  There are a lot of great ideas on these boards, I hope that you find some use for them.  And if you can’t give us anything, really think hard before you take it a way.   <P>-Pikap <BR>25lvl rogue MT <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Dont Nerf Evade.  You obviously dont play on live servers - otherwise you'd know that your theory of mob's attacking faction players due to a rogues evade is just that: theory.  Let me repeat for you  what EVERYONE has been saying:  IT DOESNT WORK THAT WAY IN THE LIVE GAME.  If you keep with this "top 3" you will do 3 things: ensure that multiple rogues ALL stay at the top and die quickly.  Ensure that single rogues become mush less useful to parties.  And due to the first tin, you basically ensure that only *ONE* rogue will be allowed in raids and multi-group combats, due to them dying so quickly and being a big drain on the casters in a way that warriors and hybrids are not.  You basically kill rogues ability to be a useful part of the hgihest level quests and combats in the game.<P><BR>All that in order to prevent something that NOBODY has complained about?<P>Come on Absor - be man enough to admit you guys read the code and design, but were mistaken about what happens at run time with all those wonderfully unpredictable players involved.<P>The static system of your rules and such are radically altered in the dynamic arena of mulitple group combat, and large raids.  And it doesnt really even work that way with a 1 or 2 group combat, nor in single combat (a rogue generally isnt going to evade worth a darn when soloing).<P>You were wrong- please see that and stop this nonsense.<P>And by the way, raise the Safe Fall caps above 100.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Heh,<P>Verant, in the past month I have been nearing the first hell.  As I hit hell (in Frountier Mountains) I noticed my evade was getting LESS EFFECTIVE and working LESS than before, on the same mob!  Doesnt matter is if it is a 20 sarnak or a 35 craig, it still fails about 50 to 65 percent of the time, when ever i pull a backstab off, the mob turns on me, does about 200 damage (out of my 800hp total) and then turns only cause a warrior taunts him.  Doesnt matter if I BS for 40 or 120 they still turn on me, beat the %$^#& out of me and the cycle continues, eventually I die.<P>Did I miss something?  You want to LOWER evade's effciveness?  Uhh... heh.  That is funny, I am guessing a 40% or more drop in rogues within the first week of the nerf, we cant take another blow like that.  As it is right now a warrior, pally, monk, ranger, druid, wizard, cleric, and mage are perfered over me, making me even MORE of a mana sponge wont solve a situation, just create new ones.<P>Is that the only way you can think to solve a problem?  Create a new one?  I stopped playing my mage cause of the contant blows the class was taking and lack of new things for them, it became redundent.<P>Just got one thing to say, if you get your way on this, you might see Seox over on Ashron's Call or Phantasy Star Online, gawd, maybe even Diablo 2 or lack of a better game!  The constant blows to characters, you fix them, then blow them again!

</FONT><HR>Verant, if you make this Evade change, we NEED 1 of the following 3 things. <P>1) We better get more HPs so we can take the beating<P>2) We get a higher AC modifier so we can take the beating<P>3) You make evade NEVER fail at 200skill.<P>If you don't like those 3 options... DONT CHANGE EVADE.  I don't want to hear from the cleric in my group: "why heal you, when it costs me less mana to rez".  I think that was previously referred to the Rangers, dont make the finger point at Rogues now.<BR> <BR>WE ARE BALANCED. <P>Evade doesnt work well enough anyways.

</FONT><HR>Btw now that I have flame mode off here are some suggustions to help balance the rogue class (we still pale in comparison to warriors or even rangers ((that know how to play their class...why does tht sound so funny?)))<P>1.  Stackable poisons - I have experimented with poisons and looked forward to them, but if they arnt stackable they are useless.<P>2.  Give apply poison to everyone, but not make poison, a class only skill like tinkering or alchemy, so it isnt a moneysponge like it is now<P>3.  Give a disipline or skill between 31-50, this will keep intrest higher.<P>4.  Add some toys, flame rapiers, masks, fun things, heck, give us a party uniform (all classes/races) that makes us look like a clown, image this on an ogre! haha!.<P>5.  Dont nerf evade.  I really dont wanna be a sponge-warrior.<P>6.  Make us be able to disarm and pickpocket magic items at 35, not 60.<P>7.  More weapons with procs, or higher damage weps, with a high delay to make up for it.<P>8.  Rogue only armor and weapons!<P>9.  Tracking is a big thing that would be fun to play around with, abeit not as good as a ranger, but fun none he less<P>10. If you are psychoticly bent on making our evade weaker, then make it work 100% of the time at a 37% hate reduction.  Or nerf it and give us FD.  Or do both.  I suggust doing both, to get the bloodthirsy mobs of rogue tells off your back, just let us keep hide.<P>11.  Let us pickpocket any mob (besides uber mobs), not disarm, they will notice you if you kick the weapon out of their hands, which brings me to...<P>12.  Have disarm do kick damge (like ID) when you are successful, after all, how else r u gunna take someone's weapon?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, <P>Although, this talk is suppose to cover new group, the ideas we rogues have given are primarily in the previous talks/posts. From this point on if your expecting we rogues to stop posting messages such as "DON"T NERF EVADE!!!," I think you know better than that. The majority of rogues that have played for even a moderate time knows the scenario you describe is next to impossible, as I stated in my previous post I myself died attempting it in the past. So I'll just recap on what we rogues are looking for to balance our class.<P>Important:<P>Evade- fine: we don't see anything wrong with it besides how randomly it works, but we'd like the way it is better than your new proposal<P>Hide/Sneak- change: allow us to sneak through zones without losing hide<P>Poison- change: please try to work poisons like sow potions and make it possible to turn into charges with some kind of bag<P>Less important:<P>Instil doubt: take a look at- how often this skill is successful on both green and blue mobs is quite questionable.<P>Safefall: change- atleast move the skill up a few points, its a wonder that monks would have a higer skill than we do considering it would be more useful to us.<P>Ragebringer: take a look at- for an epic weapon it is rather plain, please think of a way to make it more noticeable by making it glow or shimmer with light or anything<P>Kallus of Rathe<BR>46th Rogue</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I do hate to see anything being done to evade. The problems that were talked about with a rogue...Well I for one never have seen it happen before... However, it is clear evade will be nerfed so heres what would be some nice changes to a rogue.<BR>First poisons are far to expensive, when I first got apply poison, I thought nice, going to make me some poison great. Well being that my class armor is camped by farmers, its far to expensive to spend all my money on to learn. I have only met one rogue in my life who ever used poison end of story. Poisons=useless do to price...Keep in mind not all of us have a necro who farms everything for us...<BR>Next would be our class armor, our class armor is just too much of a pain to get. My girlfriend who is a shaman, with guild help got all totemic armor (other than the helm) in no time at all. Make ravenscale no drop or something. Look at ravenscale, compare that to crafted. Getting ravenscale is nothing more to alot of us, than items to save up for...And by the time we get ravenscale we will be in hate...<BR>Evade will be worked on, please test the hell outta this before going live with it... Without evade, we are 100 percent unplayable. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>don't touch evade!!<BR>if you do, you will have basicly REDESIGN the whole class!!! and that means more balancing issues, and more work for the development team!<P>but i will gladly accept the "'nerf'" of evade if you can promise that the class will be ballanced after this HUGE loss of defense, thus a just as HUGE increase in offence,.... ohhhh i am thinking like 8 attacks a round-using 30damage 19delay 0 weight daggers, quad-backstabing --WHILE using ID, and our disc's with say 1 min recycle times!<P>if you take the only thing that keeps me alive, and makes it possible for me to do the extra damage that i gave up my defense and about 3k hps, then i am nothing more than a liability to my group, and anyone else around me for that matter!!<P>how is this, ask yourself what can a rogue do if he/she is fighting like a warrior, that a warrior can't do better?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Greetings Absor<P>First off, i would like to thank you for the Improvments to the Bind Wound, Pickpocket and Apply Poison Skills.  <P>As for Evade, I do not like the way it works Currently, although i think the changes you have talked about are a bit too extreme.  Evading to the very bottom of the Hate list in a 6 man exp group can spell trouble for the Cleric/Chanter/Casters that are sitting medding while the melees are fighting.  I try to keep my aggro somewhere between the Main tanks and casters in case the tank dies or goes LD.<P>The proposed change works pretty well to achieve this in a 6 person exp group.  by lowereing us to number 3 on the Hate list, it puts us between Tanks and Casters rather nicely.  Staying in that spot requires a bit of effort and well timed evades, but it's the Ideal place for a Rogue to be in order to deal dmg through Backstabs, yet still be able to pick up and take some hits in case the main tanks (number 1 and 2) die or go LD.<P>On a Large Scale raid though, Only dropping us to Number 3, isn't very effective.  With full buffs/haste, it is VERY Easy to get to the top of the hate list.  If you only drop to number 3 after a successful evade, then you'll be right back at the top in no time as soon as you turn attack back on.  Doesnt' take too long before you end with a dead Rogue.  It only gets worse with multiple Rogues.<P>In my Opinion, the best way to fix this problem, would be to implement the 33 percent idea.  It would put the Rogue in the top third of the Hate list easily, Still with the Chance of aggroing back to the top, but not as fast.<P>Major change to the Evade skill could mean Death for Rogues on high lvl Raids. Is Evade really that Overpowering?  I don't think so.  Sure, you can change it to make it a bit harder for Rogues to live through big raids, but is REALLY necessary?  As it is, through all of my numerous High lvl fights, (Dragons, Gods, Etc...) I have only been alive to see the mob fall to the ground ONCE.  Rogues do Lots of dmg, but we already pay for it.  Evade does not totally Eliminate a Rogue taking dmg, and eventually, we'll die anyway.  The Change will just cause us to die faster.<P>As for my Wishlist:<BR>Sneak/Hide through Zones, LD and Camping<BR>Stackable Poisons (item with a # of Summon: Poison Spell?)<BR>Better selection of Throwing Weapons (Better RANGE)<P>Just a few minor things that I'd like to see implemented.<P>Keaile<BR>52nd Rogue of Druzzil Ro<P>Quote from Absor:<P>"Don't bother, I didn't even bring my wallet. I knew what sort of crowd I would be hanging out with"<P>hehe, If i was in your position, i'd be more worried about my kidneys.  <BR>(meant as a joke, not a threat)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>How about this (From a post at the SafeHouse)<P>Put the rogue 1 person above the middle of the aggro list?<P>In a 6 person group this drops him to second.<P>In a 2-3 group hunt, he would be no worse than 8th, meaning probably only rogues, warriors and monk or hybrid ahead of him.  In those circumstances, he'd return to the top of the aggro list quickly.<P>In a massive raid, he still still be up there above anyone thats not actively involved, and a couple backstabs and fast damage weapons will put him back near the top quickly.<P>Ask any tank thats tried to save a rogue even afther they evade - you can taunt your butt off, and the mob is STILL going to be beating on the rogue.  It just doesnt work the way you say in the live game on a normal server, you're mistaken in your belief that this is somethign that needs to be fixed.  You've had over a hundred rogue players post to tell you so and explaoin to you why your fix is a bad one.  If you want more expert opinions from the people that know the class best, go to the Safehouse and post or read.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056582-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056582-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056582-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056582-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056582-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056582-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056582&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056582&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
