</FONT><HR>Ok, here are my rules for resurrections, etc... Seems a lot of people here assume clerics are 100% greedy :/ that's bad mmmkay?<P>1. If I'm in the zone, and the corpse is dragged to me, the res is free, no questions asked, donations accepted, never required.<P>2. If a train went through and people got killed and I couldn't heal anyone in time, I res for free and heal/buff them all up.<P>3. If I'm wandering around and see a corpse with an owner logged on, I msg the person and ask if they would like a res... never charge. Most of the time this ends up resulting in a large donation for some odd reason :P sheesh.<P>4. If the corpse is several zones away, they are required to pay... I'm sorry, but if it takes me away from my group and sucks my mana up then yes, I'm going to charge. The same would be applied to many druids if they were nagged to give a TP while they were grouped.<P>As for donations, take this for greedy, I gave a free res to a druid who wasn't even grouped with me. What did he do immediately after? He said he could tp me for a DISCOUNTED 50pp... DISCOUNTED for crying out loud. I just spent over half of my mana ressing/healing/buffing his sorry butt when he said that he would discount me this one time for a TP... :/ I pay for TPs always... but never 50pp... <P>Good story: Last night I went to Frontier Mountains (FM) to res my guildmate's wife. I ressed her but noticed that there were three corpses there in full armor so I sent tells to all three and ressed them. They were only in their early 30's and they were really thankful  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>The thing is Karma is a big deal. If I'm nice to these people, then in turn it will come back to me in the future... guaranteed. <P>I don't like charging, but only do if the person is:<P>a) a jerk to me (some are really demanding jerks)<BR>b) wants me to find the corpse for them and they don't even have a loc<BR>c) wants me to jog across three zones to res</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Why do people ask for a rez?  Because their time is valuable to them and they don't want to spend the time it would take to earn the exp back.  How can anyone think then that the clerics time is not valuable to them?  It's not just the time spent waiting for the person to bring the corpse, or worse yet the time spent traveling to the corpse, it's also the time spent getting the mana back.  How is value expressed in Everquest?  Platnum.  <P>I think it's great when someone is willing to donate their time to help me, but I don't expect it of them.  Compare it to the beggers in the newbie ground.  Some of them demand that you give them things and then are offended when you won't.  Most players are very annoyed when they run into these sorts of people.  Same holds true for a rez, you can't expect that someone just give you 30 minutes out of their day everytime you ask for it.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think these posts must be grouped by level. <P>As far as charging for the ports, there comes a time when druids and wizards don't really need he money from ports. At this time its simple. If i'm not doing anything i port them and say, have a nice day. After all, friends are more valuable then plat. If i am busy, i might say no once if they keep trying and somehow i can leave my camp, then damn right i'll take thier plat.<BR>        I have no idea about rezzes as i don't die  outside anymore. Inside dungeons i always try to have a cleric with me. Even if the group is mowing down the mobs and hardly losing any health, i almost always hate to be there without a cleric. With no cleric around  have an inchy trigger finger on my evac spell button.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have a druid.  He's one of my three main chars.  When I am trying to raise some extra cash, I will auction my services.  Generally, when I do that, that's all I'm doing for the evening.<P>If someone is on a corpse run, I don't charge (and yes, I've probably been fooled into it so people could get a free port).  If someone tells me they are headed to a wedding or some other RP event, I don't charge.<P>I don't charge group members for ports.  I don't charge guild members for ports.<P>I've given ports away because people have wanted to pay too much (I refuse to accept 100plat for a port, that's just stupid) and they wouldn't pay me only 20 plat (the highest I charge).  I have a standard pricing structure I use.  15 plat for 1 person, 10 plat per person for more than one.  If I were asking for a res, I would expect to get the cleric, pay at least 200 plat and I would then offer to port the cleric to somewhere more convenient for him/her.  It's not an attitude of 'd00d', but one of respect for someone else's time.<P>I've never asked a cleric for a res.  I've gotten two of them, and both were from people I was grouped with.<P>I provide SoWs for free (won't accept money for them).  I provide buffs for free (won't accept money for them).  I have spent evenings where I go help a group of lowbies for an hour or so.  If somehow, you find my attitude offensive, I think I'm pretty okay with that.  I sleep fine at night.<P>Have a great day!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I  agree with the original poster. If you want the res, PAY for it. Period.<P>I have never asked for one, but if I do, the first thing out of my mouth would be to ask what it cost him to res me. Second would be an offer for that + some profit to make it worth his time. NO WAY I would ever ask a total stranger for a res without offering to pay for the service. To me, that is just plain rude.<P>As for porting, I'm a druid. If you don't want to pay the standard 10p for my time, then take the boat friend. Certainly, if I am going that way, and you are too, ya get a ride-even corspe runs get a freebie (sucks to get killed afore you have a chance to bind). <P>If you want me to go out of my way, then pay me-before the ride.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>To each their own.  My own policy on resurrections are that if I am not doing anything at the time, not yet in a group, between groups or just getting ready to camp, I resurrect for free if the corpse is dragged to me in a timely fashion, but am willing to travel small distances if there is little risk to my person from aggro mobs.  I usually cancel any attempts at payment unless for some reason I am not especially fond of the recipient for some reason, but not enough to ignore them.<P>If I am in a group then I would like payment of some kind.  No specific amount.  This payment I generally split out to my group members, as my downtime for medding is their downtime.  The corpse has to be dragged to me if I am in a group.  If the person is a pissant and insisting on a rez, and that I leave my group and run to the zone at great risk to myself when I am deep inside a dungeon, I put them on /ignore no matter how much plat is on the table.<P>Friends ride free.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Differences between TP and res?<P>TP?  You normally ask the traveler in the zone.  Many times, you are asking the druids/wizards standing right there at the ring/spires with you.  VERY rarely do folks ask a druid 8 zones away for a TP..they look and shout in zone.<P>Res?  Odds that the cleric is near the corpse?  Low.  Some folks drag corpses, ok...other cases, folks ask ME to go to the corpse.  That means either travel (and clerics go thru mana fast fighting off greens that they can't outrun/invis/levitate by/over) or even worse, leave my group?  Also, when folks die, the ALWAYS do a /who all clr 49 60 and you get tells from 3-4-8 zones away, offering TPs and what not to come do it...as if leaving your group in BW, getting TP'd to SRo, running into LGuk to Res, then getting TP'd back to DL to run back to BW wasn't taking 30 mins!<P>If i'm around and you drag the corpse to me, and i'm not busy, hell, it's only mana.  If you are slowing down my hunting, it's gonna cost.  You make me travel so it takes even MORE of my hunting time it costs you even MORE.  Unless, of course, you are one of my buds.  The druid/wizard who offered to port my nekkid arse around for a CR without me even asking.  Or cast that SoW on me as I was making a nekkid run thru a zone.

</FONT><HR><BR>Quick Resurrection story.<P>I'm a cleric. A few short levels away from my first exp rez, I died in Splitpaw. I had not bound nearby for various reasons.  I was about to take a Revive from a paladin in our group, when I was informed that a 52 vicar was performing resurrections at the zone (on corpses right next to mine, essentially). I sent him a polite tell asking if I could get one. Note, this was the first time in a year of playing I had ever asked for a resurrection, and only because he was already *right* *there*. <P>"I charge for my 49 rez" was his response.<P>At that point I had 300pp to my name. I told him I could scrape up 30pp. That was a very significant chunk of money for me at that time. He proceeded to bicker and ask if I could go to the bank, borrow money from guildmates, do whatever I had to do to get more money.<P>"nevermind". <P>Had the paladin revive me.<P>From that point onward, my resolve that I would never "charge" for resurrection was strengthened. (And I won't accept donations from other clerics even if offered.. although one did hand me money the other day before I realized he was a cleric.. and then wouldn't take it back. Grrr.) <P>To this day, now 53, I've never charged. I accept donations, sure, and I've gotten some very nice ones. But I've never told anyone nor implied that I require payment. And if I'm not doing anything else in a high-casualty zone, I /ooc my services for free resurrection.<P>I also go /roleplay most of the time, but that's just because I have a hard time saying no.<P>Just wanted to point out that the original poster's attitude of entitlement is not something shared by all clerics. I do appreciate the donations, but they certainly haven't made me rich. If you really want to make me happy, do one of the following:<P>*give me some form of mana restoration!!* - those resurrects are EXPENSIVE to cast! Much more than a teleport. Have your necro friend transfer mana, have your mage friend make me some mod rods.. something!<P>*give me some peridot or jasper - 9 times out of 10 this is where I'm going to spend your donation cash anyway.<P>*give me some SoW potions. (no jboots here)<P>Finally, on the teleport vs. rez debate.. I get free teleports much more often than I can get anyone to accept a donation from me.. but many of them say they don't take money from clerics so I'm probably not the best person to comment. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

If your level 40+ and you cant afford 100pp, you should quit because frankly you suck."<P>1) If you're grouped then doesn't your group deserver your undivided attention?<P>2) If you decide to spend mana rezzing someone on group time just to make 100 plat, you're a bad cleric.<P>3) You say you rez people for free, but now you say you expect 100 plat. Does that make you a liar?<P>4) If people who can't afford 100 plat suck, yet you're creating ill will by charging this supposedly trivial amount, then maybe it's you who sucks :-)<P>Slayer97 also said :<P>"Note: I res for free, but I would charge an ******* like you 1000 plat if I could."<P>1) If your mindset is focused on who you will and will not charge that puts you in the same category as loan sharks and divorce attorneys.<P>2) If I'm someone you truly despise, you would compromise your own principles for 1000 plat? Is that all it takes to buy you?<BR> <BR>Slayer97 then said :<P>"fizzle - my guess is your are new to the game LOL! hahaha<BR>A druid deserves to be paid for a teleport! He saves you TIME. When you are 40+ you can easily make 100pp an hour unless you are an idiot (perhaps you are)"<P>1) Let's pretend I'm new to the game. Is that how you treat new people?<P>2) Spoken like a true mercenary. "Time is Money." Do you bill little old ladies if you happen to help one across the street?<P>3) Time is money when I'm working. When I'm playing a video game, I help people out because those are my priorities. Obviously you have different priorities. You should've been a necro, it pays better.<P>4) As for your "idiot" comment, as usual the brilliance of your wit leaves me breathless.<P>Some more Brilliant logic by Slayer97 :<P>Even if the cleric/druid/wiz is sitting there, did you even think he might be in a group? <BR>--------<P>You ever think that maybe if you're in a group you should concentrate on the group rather than price gouging people at the expense of those you are grouped with?<P>-----------------------<P>I have 2200 mana, res cost me 500 mana. Thats a bit less than 25% of my mana. BUT, if im in a group of 6, multiply that times 6 and its now 150% of my mana because a simple minded mage like you just cost my group 3,000 mana due to downtime.<BR>-----<P>So if someone comes to you for a rez, it's 500 mana multiplied by the number of people in your group? And what school of Mathematics would this newly discovered theorem belong to?<P>----------------------<BR>If you dont want to pay for a 50%, 80% or better res, you are welcome to spend 4 hours recovering the death (if you are lucky LOL) by me.<BR>----------------------<P>I thought you said you didn't charge for rezzes. Doesn't this mean you're a liar?<P>---------------------<P>If you are mad because your lame class cant make money, start another class loser<BR>=====================<P>1) Wow. And you mean to tell me you're 40-something with children? You actually hold a JOB with those social skills? Amazing. <P>2) Uh. My "lame" class can't make money? *LOL* <P>3) So let me ask you this. Does that mean Warriors, Paladins, Rangers, Shadowknights, Bards, Monks, Rogues, and all the rest of the classes that don't have additional ways of making money are all lame classes? Or is it just mages?<P>4) If suddenly Clerics got nerfed and there was no more rez, would Clerics suddenly be considered a "lame" class? Would *YOU* change classes if a source of in-game income was cut off?<P>5) You say your son plays a Mage. Does that mean he is "lame" too?<P>6) You say that he has an SMR yet your gear is poor. Does that mean that you are also "lame" for not being able to make 100 plat an hour? You say that 100 plat is a small sum that is easily made in one hour, then why is your gear so poor? Is it because you spend all your time "helping people" for a fee? (yes, that was sarcasm.)<P>7) You say that you don't charge yet you note the names of people who don't make a donation. Doesn't this mean that you are in fact charging them without telling them? Does this mean that some people may mistake your omission for a "good deed?"<P>8) If time is money, then what is the time of every class besides the Cleric and Druid worth? Does that mean that the time of 2 classes is valuable and the time of everyone else is worthless? Does that mean that everyone else is simply "lame" as you put it?<P>Little anecdote about what happened to me the other day.<P>I was moving my Warrior through south freeport and needed a bind at the gates.<P>"I need a bind by south gates!"<P>Weenie tells you : "How much will you give me? I want 2 plat."<P>/r Sorry I don't deal with people like you. Keep your bind.<P>2 minutes later a young enchie walked by and bound me. I gave her 5 plat.<P>What I'm talking about has nothing to do with 10 plat or 50 or 100. It has nothing to do with money at all.<P>I can pay any amount. But I just don't deal with people who treat themselves like whores.<P>If you sit there and haggle with me for a rez, I put you on ignore and find a nice cleric who isn't a loot whore (there are alot of nice clerics out there.) Then they get my money, and you don't because they deserve it. People who help others and ask nothing in return deserve goodwill. People like you whose only consideration is "What's in it for me?" deserve nothing. And maybe that's why you're a high level cleric with crummy equipment.<P>A little bit about me :<P>My primary is a 45 Mage. I didn't make a Mage to be "powerful" or get "phat loot." I play the class because it's interesting.<P>I can solo but I don't because it's boring. I look for groups and it gets frustrating sometimes when you can't find one.<P>Although money isn't a problem for me, I'm not there to impress people. I wear what I think looks nice.<P>If I'm in dire need of money, there are a couple of goodies that I have no problem camping, that net me about 2k for a 4 hour camp. Like I said, it's not about money, it's about ATTITUDE.<P>My friendship is not for sale. If I won't help you for free, then I won't help you for 1000 plat either. If I help you, it is always free.<P>If your "good will" is for sale, then I want neither your good will nor your services.<P>If my corpse is in the zone, I raaaarely ask for a rez unless there's a cleric standing right next to it.<P>I'm level 45 with twice as much /played time as YOU. Does it sound like 4 hours of xp is a major setback for me? I loot my corpse and continue what I was doing, mostly being in groups and learning new rooms, learning new spawns, meeting new people, helping out others.<P>And that's a fun game for me. <P>At this very moment, I can honestly say that I own every piece of equipment that I want. It's not always the most expensive, but it looks great. Can you say the same?<P>If you wanna know the definition of "lame", read your thread about those boots that someone looted.

</FONT><HR>General rules of thumb:<BR>1. Good friends get free rezes, no questions asked.<BR>2. Fellow clerics, even if they are total jerks I don't like, get free rezs no questions asked.<BR>3. Group members get free rezs no questions asked<BR>4. A situation that is No inconvenience to me + No danger will usually get a free rez. Exception to this is if you have made my "jerk list" or my "never rez" list. Jerks are a subjective thing, as are never rez. Both lists are short. I can check my ignore list to see who made them.<BR>5. If I have to travel, and travel into harms way, especially by myself, you better be ready to cough up some peridots and/or pearls.<P>Best offer I have had was 500pp for a corpse in my zone that would be pulled to me (I didn't take anything).<P>Worst offer I have had was a "DEMAND" that I travel from Karnors Castle to the Hole for a rez because "After all you are a cleric, thats what you are here for"<P>Most unique offer I have had, "I will give you cybersex for a rez" Hmmmmm <P>As for buffs. If a stranger comes up to me and asks for a symbols buff he better have the gem for what he wants. I have decided I am no longer a charitable institution giving away 13 plat at a time to folks I don't know. Otherwise its on a mana state basis.<P>I DONT EVER leave a group once I have joined unless its a R/L emergency, or without giving them at least 30 mins notice so they can try to find a replacment. I hate it when someone says, "Sorry guys got to go now got an offer for (fill in name of better camp here). Or "gee my guild needs me now for (again fill in name of better hunt here). These folks often will make the pay-as-you-go list. More often they make the unpreferred-and-unreliable-groupmate list. When you are in the bottem of some dungeon and all of a sudden your Wizzy/Shaman/Druid is suddenly TPing out of there, well, this is definately NOT a class act.<P>Storm</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My major problem with the "it's a service so sell it" argument is this.<P>Only 4 classes have services to sell.<P>If EVERY class had something valuable they could pass on to someone else for a fee, turnabout would be fair play.<P>What services does a Warrior have to sell? Or a Paladin? Or a Shadowknight?<P>I've always been pro-melee and I still am. Because I know how much it sucks to play a class that can't do ANYTHING for themselves.<P>When there's a warrior seeking a bind, I go out of my way to do it, because I have options and HE DOES NOT.<P>Nobody should have to pay for basic necessities such as being bound. Or something stupid like having a LIGHT SOURCE when you die.<P>I think we casting classes as a whole are spoiled. I'm bound at the zone. Big whoop. I die, I go back and get my stuff.<P>When the warrior dies, he's bound in Freeport, so he's making the 6 zone run to LGuk.<P>No, it is not our fault that VI in their infinite wisdom decided that casting classes have the convenience of respawning anywhere they want, and the tanking classes must run 6 zones just to get their corpse.<P>If the issue was ONLY about XP I would understand.<P>If you're already IN the zone and the ONLY reason you want a rez is to make back the precious XP, I can understand charging for it.<P>But many times the issue IS NOT XP, the issue is PLAYABILITY.<P>If I spawn at the zone, yet you spawn 6 zones away, THAT IS A PLAYABILITY ISSUE.<P>No, it is not my *FAULT* that the melee classes were shafted in terms of playability.<P>But it is my Responsibility to equilize the boneheaded design decisions as much as I can by binding these people without a hassle, by porting them when I can, and by helping them out when they have trouble getting their corpse.<P>Because I am lucky enough to have these options, and they are not.<P>Someday VI will hit one of our classes with a nerf stick, and tell us that we can no longer bind ourselves. And then you'll see what sort of a FUBAR situation it is to make a 6 zone corpse run multiple times just to avoid losing your gear.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I am doing the Coldain Prayer Shawl quest and Yesterday I'm at the bridge in EW. I get a tell from somone needing a rez at the orc fort. Now I need bunny meat for this quest so I offer to trade the rez for 2 bunny meats. He doesn't have any so he offers 200pp. I don't need the plat so I tell him that when he gets the meat I will Rez... (I'm in the zone for a few hours and not going anywhere) A few mins later he /shouts about "inconsiderate clerics and their damn rabbit meat" oh well, /ignore. Sheez... 2 rabbit meat is a hell of a lot cheaper than 200 plat.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Storm, your last post was right on  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"><P>Aideen, it is not a right to get a res everytime you die. <P>it is not the CLeircs "job" to res everyone that dies, all over Norrath. Now, totally aside from that, Unless I am on my way to meet someone, every clothed body I see, I will stop and see if they are online, if they are, I ask if they need a res. No charge, but I usually do not turn down the plat unless they put too much in the window. While 200 plat is a nice offer, I do not feel right taking it for just walking by and finding your body. <P>Now, if I have to sit and res 5 ormore people, the price I will accept will go up. I will take the larger sums, only because I am going to be there a while. I never ask for more once someone has started to give me any coins, even if it is a few gold. I do not presume to know about their finacial situation or anything like that.<P>I have often went many zones away to res someone, that is how I got my Quest chestplate by ressing a druid in Butcherblock when I was in South Ro.<P>A lot of the problem is that clerics are afraid to say no. If I res someone while I am in a group, I ask the group, gauge the pulls and my mana use and if there is no danger, I res, take the donation and split it with the group.  It's just mana. While in the group, my mana is as much theirs as mine.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You know what? I dont ever take money for ports anymore, but I also dont port people I dont know unless I happen to be heading that way. I just love the attitude that I am supposed to DROP everything and leave my group and come port someone for a few coins....a few coins I would get by playing the game anyway. People that res and port you are doing YOU a favor, not the other way around. We are not NPC's and hailing us and saying the phrase [port to Gfay for 10pp] does not entitle you to whine, moan, etc. No I dont charge, because I've learned to play the game instead of be a taxi to ingrates.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Interesting RP spin on rezzes....<P>Next time you get a belligerent rez request, ask what religion their character is.  If it's not your cleric's religion, simply respond, "Not for the likes of YOU, heathen!" and ignore them.<P>Well, don't actually /ignore them, just don't respond to them... I imagine that some of the crap they'll be saying might be hilarious.  Only problem is that either they might lie and guess your game (in which case you need to know that that troll SK can't POSSIBLY be a follower of Tunare), or they might just happen to be the same religion, in which case you are left out to dry by your own joke.  Might be worth it some times, though.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What about clerics with an epic?  The other day I had just given all my money to a friend to buy an item our group needed, and shortly after found myself dead with 15pp to my name. I drug my corpse to a cleric with a watersprinkler whose group was fighting at the zone.  I sat down in the corner and asked her if she could res me when she had time.  She stood up and clicked her epic and I got level 46 back.  I thanked her heartily and went on my way.  I would have offered a donation but didn't have any cash.  Do clerics expect a donation for an epic res?  All it costs is 8 seconds of casting time, so it seems to me that a donation isn't necessary if you come to them and let them do it when they have time.<P>As far as teleports go, my 29 druid accepts donations but doesn't charge.  If I'm busy I won't ususally drop what I'm doing to go port unless they are promising 20pp or more.  If I'm going anyway or porting someone else, I'll let you ride for free and refuse donations.  That said, I'm always disappointed when I port someone and they don't even offer a donation.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
