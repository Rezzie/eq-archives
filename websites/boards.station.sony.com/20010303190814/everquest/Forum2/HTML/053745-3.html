</FONT><HR>Bards don't get double attack, instead they get haste.  But that haste doesn't work with an enchanter around.  Hence all the requests for more melee damage, because without that haste, bard melee is unbalanced.<P>All bard effects stack.  This is so universal that there is special code that says if caster = bard, stack.  That's why cantana will go up when C2 is up, because ALL bard songs stack.  Enchanters don't have the same code, and C2 is 1 mana/tick weaker than cantana so it won't overwrite, thus C2 bounces.<P>Haste should stack as well.  Ah, but what about shamans?  Their haste doesn't stack.  Well shaman resist buffs don't stack with other resist buffs.  Shaman str buffs doesn't stack with other str buffs.  Shaman ac buffs don't stack with other hp buffs.  Shamans have a X^2 curve if all they ever do is heal (or nuke), all the other effects are there to help the class make up for the weakness it has in healing (or nuking), not to keep to the X^2 curve.<P>Bard haste IS there to keep the bard on the X^2 curve.  And when an enchanter is around, it  doesn't exist.<P>I honestly can't think of a single argument against haste stacking, yet there are literally dozens of valid arguments for it.  I'm curious why there is such resistance to the idea.  What is the argument for having bard haste, of all the bard abilities, not stack?  Why is it the exception?<P>If you haven't seen it, check out the history of haste stacking and some "what if" math at <BR>http://www.afterlifeguild.org/Thott/haste_stacking.html.<P>--Thott<BR>Guildleader<BR>&lt;Afterlife&gt;<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just a thought to the people that posted it.<P>Someone asked that bard defensive abilities be raised to be just below a ranger's defense abilities.<P>You realize, you are currently about 10-15 points ABOVE rangers in defensive abilities, and you have better armor as well...changing your defense to be just BELOW  a ranger's would be a serious nerf.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Okay... folks, the issue is balance.<P>The broken aspects of our class are annoying but not really a part of the balance topic.<P>Mechanical issues, such as auto-twisting are also outside of the scope of this discussion.<P>We need to focus on what changes would bring us to parity with the other classes.<P>OVERVIEW: It's fairly obvious that we're doing okay through the first 20 levels, with a few notable exceptions. From 20-32 we slowly decline in comparison to the other classes as everything we can do is eclipsed by someone else. From 32-50 the decline increases, making us little more than a mana battery for caster. Then from 50-60 we seem to become more of a liability than an asset from all I can tell.<P>As it stands, the most useful position for a bard from mid-levels on is to find a fighter or two and run support for them. As soon as a real caster or two joins the group, there's hardly any use for the bard. I don't think this was or is Verant's "vision" for the class.<P>The overwhelming reason most of us choose barding as a profession seems to be the unusual aspects of it. We enjoy surprising those around us with what we can do, and like doing what we do in a different manner than everyone else. This should remain a defining aspect of the class.<P>SPECIFICS:<P>UTILITY SONGS: Our utility songs are fairly useless due to the short range of effect. We cannot reliably shepherd groups across the world, since our speed, levitation, and invisibility songs have too short a range to allow a group to move. Either increasing the range, increasing the duration, or a combination of both would alleviate this problem, and since these songs don't aid in experience generation, I really can't see how this can be honestly argued against.<P>PROBLEM: Limited range and duration makes them nearly useless in real play.<BR>SOLUTION: Increase range and/or duration of non-combat songs such as levitation, invisibility, fast travel, etc.<P>COMBAT SONGS: The majority of our combat songs are markedly inferior to similar spells, occupy the bulk of our time, and are resisted an insane amount of time.<P>As an experiment I spent a couple of hours last night in Crushbone at level 31 playing lullaby for orc centurions. They resisted between 40 and 50% of the time... these are creatures 20+ levels below me, and I cannot use a sleep song to keep them sleeping? How ridiculous.<P>Any effect whether spell or song should be resisted with the length of effect taken into consideration. If a spell can be cast 6 times in a minute, then lasts for 5-10 minutes when it finally works, then why are songs which last for 9-12 seconds being resisted at the same rate? If any caster were restricted to only casting three spells during an encounter, they'd never run out of mana and spend most of the time wandering around bored. We have a frenetic task of keeping at most three "spell effects" active during a battle, yet cannot get anywhere close to the same reliability or effect of a spell, whether from caster or hybrid.<P>PROBLEM: Resists on vs. enemy songs are too high considering limitations of singing mechanics and extremly short duration of effects.<BR>SOLUTION: Decrease resistance on songs, or severely increase duration.<P>As for our combat enhancement and combat utility songs, such as hastes, chains, and mesmerize spells, resistance is not the only problem. Virtually all of these conflict directly with caster based spells that are more valuable to a group. Even the lower hybrid spells available to rangers, paladins, and shadowknights are more desirable versions of effects than the bard's songs.<P>The simple solution, it seems to me, is to let the effects stack. Overwriting and spell/song conflicts have destroyed the usefulness of the vast majority of our songs. Chains interferes with snare, any of our haste songs interferes with speed, our slow songs interfere with slow magic, even our pathetically weak damage shields interfere with other damage shields. I say, let them all stack... every last one. Let us be a desired asset to a party... rather than a liability.<P>Looking back, specifically at haste/slow stacking issues from the past, the problem seems to be that haste spells, plus item haste, plus a bard's haste made some groups too fast too quickly... I've never seen a haste item, but from what I can tell they're rather high-level items. Caster haste spells also work a heck of a lot more powerfully than anything a bard can do. So to fix this problem, the lowest component was made so it couldn't work in concert with the others?<P>I cannot believe that across the land, overhasted groups were ruining the game. This adjustment to correct what seems to have been a specific high-powered problem, filtered all the way down to the level 1 bard song... making the vast majority of our combat support songs relatively useless for anything but partial groups and solo efforts. Parity can only be achieved here by either boosting the haste effects to rival spells (which I doubt you would ever do), or letting them stack.<P>PROBLEM: Any non-damage song a bard might sing in combat is useless, because it conflicts with more effective efforts by casters and hybrids and does more harm than good.<BR>SOLUTION: Let songs stack with the spells, across the board. The effects are much lower than spells, and the limitations of only being able to keep two or three active are sufficient to keep this from imbalancing the game.<P>ADVANCEMENT: Finally, as casting classes advance, they get much larger mana pools, numerous mana-recovery options, and an enormous array of spells to choose from. Bards continue to get a small array of songs, which are not drastically better than the ones preceding them. A high-level caster can use more spells in a combat than they could at low levels, yet the bard can still only use three non-conflicting effects. Since melee abilities don't significantly increase either, bards are left behind with regards to effectiveness.<P>Perhaps allowing songs to increase duration as a bard advances, letting high level bards twist 3, 4, even 5 songs at a time if they wish, would compensate for this problem.<P>PROBLEM: While other classes can accomplish much more at higher levels, bards are limited to the two or three effects they can "twist" together.<BR>SOLUTION: Increase song effect duration with level advancement to allow more songs to be twisted at higher levels.<P>I hope this helps somewhat... I realize I'm looking for the simple solutions to a complex problem. However, I think that balancing the class in this fashion would restore bards to the role of desired group member, without really affecting other aspects of the game.<P>Taelenmor Summerpsalm</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The thing that limits Bards is the time it takes to sing a song and the short duration of the songs.  At level 3, we can sing 3 songs at once.  At level 60, we can sing 3 songs at once.<P>At low levels, casters are hard-pressed to keep three effects active on an entire party, and they're not all that great.  Why?<P>1.  Small mana pool.<BR>2.  Slow mana regen.<BR>3.  Short spell duration.<BR>4.  Low strength/mana ratios on spells.<P>At high levels, casters are quite capable of keeping six or more effects active.  This includes buffing all relevant party members, sticking long-lasting (e.g., longer-than-the-fight) debuffs on target MOBs, spot healing, damage, snaring, et al.  Why?<P>1.  Larger mana pool.<BR>2.  Much faster mana regen (meditation, clarity, mana theft, cannablize, et al)<BR>3.  Much longer spell durations.<BR>4.  Much better strength/mana ratios on spells.<P>Bards get none of the first three advantages.  Our songs never increase in duration, so we're always stuck singing three.<P>If Bards had no melee component and were just casters with a different way of measuring their casting ability, the fact that casters go from being able to keep 2 effects active to being able to keep 6 effects active, and that those effects are better, when balanced with the fact that bards never get to increase the number of active effects, means that, in order to keep balanced, the power of Bard songs should be vastly superior to anything that they are replacing.  They should more than triple in power.  And given that our melee contribution is at best 30% that of a high-level melee character, they should still be better.<P>I am speaking here of high-level Bards.<P>At low levels (1-20) I would suggest that Bards are actually overpowered, except that they do not have a very large song list to choose from, and those levels don't last that long.<P>At mid-levels (21-40) I think the 3-song twist vs the caster mana pool works very well.  The 20s are a little too hard, the 30s a little too easy (due to the songs we get at various points), but it balances.<P>In the late pre-Kunark stage (41-50) Bards get weaker, but not to the point that it's intolerable.  They're not as much fun, they're pretty limited, they're not overly useful except in specialized circumstances, but they're not terrible.<P>Post Kunark (51-60) though, all other classes see almost a tripling of total power per character.  Bards see very little of this.  The songs that scale up do so linearly.  So while other classes are doing 3x the output at level 60 as they were at level 50, we're doing 20% more.<P>And the replacement songs just don't cut it.  You are still balancing those songs as if casters can still only do three things at once.  In addition, you have added a lot of specialized songs on the theory that the Bard can still use their lower-level (non-scaling) songs if they so choose.  They currently can't, if they want to be at all effective.<P>You need to SERIOUSLY THINK about Bard balancing post-50.  This class is VERY underbalanced.  You haven't heard all that much about this because there aren't very many Bards out there, but that does not make it any less true (in fact, the dearth of high level Bards just about proves the point).<P>1.  You need to significantly increase our haste effects on higher level songs or make them stack.  Hastes should be about 30% stronger or stackable.<P>2.  You need to significantly increase our buff strength at high levels.  Stat buffs should be about twice as strong.<P>3.  You need to significantly improve our slowing capabilities at high levels.  Slows should be about twice as strong or stackable.<P>4.  You need to moderately increase our overall damage output, perhaps 25%.<P>5.  With the exception of slow and the uselessly weak mana drains, our MOB debuffs are good.<P>6.  You need to fix all the stuff that doesn't work right, and not call that a class improvement.  We should have had that 2 years ago.<P>Kenross Cantorfojado, 56 songs</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

So, I was thinking about that, and had an idea.  Bards are primarily geared toward grouping.  What is the most pervasive problem encountered in grouping that NO class can currently prevent?  Trains!  When a train is made, they will aggro until the target leaves the zone entirely.  This is a real pain in the ass in a deep dungeon.  My solution to alleviate this problem, while at the same time strengthening the bard class, would be to introduce a new, unique-to-bards song.  This song, when used, will de-aggro the group, as if the group had zoned, and will return the spawns to their origin.  Keep reading, it gets more detailed and I attempt to deal with problems that are obvious in its abuse.  1) The song must be in effect until the mobs are completely returned to their point of origin.  If the note is missed before that, the effect is broken and the mobs will continue to aggro as before.  2) The song would of course have a chance of failure, per mob.  If the song is failed for a given mob, it will immediately aggro onto the group.  This would result in some interesting tactics and cooperation to keep the bard safe from having their spell broken.  The remaining mobs must be killed, or they will interrupt the song, which would result in the rest of the mobs re-aggroing, possibly with reinforcements!  3) One immediate and obvious abuse of this would of course be the run of the mill, high-level spawn farmer.  The spell could be used to give an even greater advantage to high-level item farmers, a grim prospect for those of us who get angry at farmers who will not let us of appropriate level have a crack at getting, say, our SK quest armor, for example :P  This abuse of the new skill would be alleviated by manipulating the rate of success for the song based on nearness to the bard's own level.  For example, if a mob or set of mobs were within 5 levels of the bard, the song would have a much higher chance of success than if the mobs were more greatly removed, be that Higher, OR Lower, from the bard's own level.  Therefore, a bard of appropriate level for the item would have a greater chance of pulling off the success of the strategy than even a much higher level bard.  This would also have the nice side effect of being useful to exp-seeking groups.  Since we tend to hunt within our level, this effect would be a boon to a group hunting for experience in dangerous areas (i.e. those dungeons Verant's been having people play in due to the difficulty?  Sound familiar?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">Hmmmmmm...)  The programming would be simple for this effect as well.  Simply have the success rate set per level comparison, then if successful, the mob treats the entire group as being zoned.  Simple.  The mob returns to its point of origin.  Anyways, I thought it was a really great idea I had, and wanted to share  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  I hope others think it is worth looking at as well.     </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I truly love my bard and never have any trouble getting a group - at least at my current level. I just wish I could take a little more damage and dish a little more out before I have to zone away from my group. I'm not asking to be a warrior or anything, but come on. As soon as I start to sing in battle the Mobs instantly agro onto me and if I'm not fighting with good taunters and healers...I'm running for the exit soon. Doesn't make me very beneficial to the group  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> People I group with, both within and outside of my guild, love my songs during battle and downtime. But I'm sick of whimping out and being one of the first to run. Can't ya make me a little tougher? Also, lets not forget that bards are the entertainers of Norrath...keep the group around during downtime by giving them a reason to stay.

</FONT><HR>Ducan: do you play a bard and group in Sebelis?<BR>From your quick uniformed comment it appears not.<P>Anyway, I had a question to Absor,<BR>he posted earlier in this thread:<BR>Absor wrote:<BR>"adiraAndante wrote:<P>             &gt;"My personal issues about bards sortof parallel their previous work. Let me tell you, it IS annoying sitting in a group with an<BR>             enchanter/shaman, and really having to wrack my brains to find effects from my repetoir that will enhance group<BR>             effectiveness. Part of the problem is bard song stacking among other songs, but haste and slow stacking with similar spell<BR>             effects would really help our groupability, and bards are absolutely supposed to be a group oriented class. <P>             I don't see how helping our group reach the haste cap faster is unbalanceing. The game was played for a very long time at<BR>             the haste cap and was still hard. Not all people have super haste items. Making them stack would increase our<BR>             effectiveness while in a group, while not decreasing the effectiveness of the shaman/enchanter. Same with slows."&lt;<P>             Well, it seems that the original design did consider this a balance issue.<P>             I'll certainly add the whole haste and slow stacking this (I hope I mentioned this before, because it's been on the list?).

</FONT><HR>?Here's a simple request that a lot of bards (I think, I know I certainly would) appreciate:<BR>understanding.  So often when new items are put it, changes are made, etc., bards are accidentally<BR>'nerfed' or in some other way affected (for the worse) simply because the people involved did not<BR>understand how bards work.<BR>For example (in no particular order, and in no way a complete list):<BR>*Imbrued platemail (poh armor), originally the AC was the same as chainmail classes,  only<BR>shortly after this was fixed, singing steel armor was implemented again with chainmail ac.<BR>*Singing Steel Effects:<BR>the boots and pants (2nd hardest/rarest piece!) cast summon water,  this issue has been all over<BR>the message boards and not anywhere has Verant even acknowledged that bards can forage, and<BR>so being able to summon food and water is a joke, and in no way affects how often they have to<BR>make trips into town<BR>bp: it has a 100 pt heal, I'm told (and my calculations concur) that by singing my regen songs I<BR>can actually heal faster not using the bp   <BR>*Selo?s Consonant Chain nerf: when snare + fear was originally nerfed, we were told that snare<BR>(when feared) was nerfed to slightly below the effect of the best necromancer darkness spell,<BR>which should not effect chain.  Apparently it wasn?t known that at lvl 40 chain was already better<BR>than anything else, any bard of that lvl could (and many did) tell you that.<BR>*melodic bp: well I don?t need to repeat everyone else<BR>*When selo?s accelerando was broken (with drums that is), the view I got from Verant was that<BR>this was minor, I think even you yourself (Absor) suggested it was just a convenience.  I<BR>personally don?t know any bards that would agree with you.  I don?t know any bards that ever run<BR>around without a drum, it?s just too slow to solo, and not everyone likes to group all the time<BR>(constant pull group = sore wrists + bored bard) Most of us consider Selo to be one of our main<BR>defensive abilities (in the outdoors).  While we have a poor physical defense (dodge caps at 125,<BR>parry and riposte at 75 and only attainted at 53 and 58, respectively) and very few effective<BR>escape spells (gate, etc.), but we can get away.  (We don?t have a terribly strong offense either, so<BR>it doesn?t balance well to have no defense).  As an aside, I agree that perhaps out offense or<BR>defense needs to be boosted a bit, either in skills or songs.  Many people seem to agree that our<BR>roll diminishes in large groups with shamans and enchanters (i.e. don?t let us dwindle into cynical<BR>short-lived manabatteries ;) )<BR>*Two songs cost mana: according to Brad (I think he said this, might have bee GZ or other), this<BR>was an oversight.  When the second mana-costing song was implemented (lvl 39 charm, which<BR>even though has the mana cost, is in every respect except level weaker than the lvl 27 song), it?s<BR>mana cost was balanced as if it was the only song that had such cost, and of course the same is<BR>true for the first.  It?s not really possible to balance the two, being so different, so suggestions<BR>were made (a 15 min timer on Dirge was suggested by Brad or whoever), but then nothing<BR>happened...<P>Well those are main ones I can think of at the moment.  Now I?m not bringing this up to complain<BR>about them.  I get tired of my class being flagrantly misunderstood by the employees of the<BR>company that made it (actually I guess what really annoys me is that everyone thinks they<BR>understand when they don?t).  So my request is to make sure people making changes know what<BR>they?re doing?the fact that people making items don?t (have not?) played the class(es) in question<BR>has merit, but there?s some silliness?you wouldn?t have a civil engineer design an airplane.  ?I?m<BR>not a real ________(insert class here), but I?ve grouped with one on CT.? doesn?t quite cut it<BR>either.  Now how does this relate to balance?  I want to make sure that all requests made are<BR>considered taking into account how bards are different (and perhaps a large number of songs/<BR>previous changes should be reevaluated?partially by people who know the class from experience).<BR>(or at least listen to us when we tell you something?s wrong?I say this in reference to the<BR>tremendous time it takes to get issues/bugs addressed/fixed, some are still outstanding from beta) <BR>Just keep in mind the difference(e.g. bards have a totally different casting system?most items with<BR>effects act very differently for us, simply because to keep a buff up we can?t stop casting to wait<BR>on a 10 sec casting time item, unlike all other casters).<P><BR>*Side request*<BR>I think that, in line with the requests for increased offensive or defensive capabilities, the taunt<BR>factor on many (all perhaps) songs should be looked into.  Some of them are ridiculously high.  I<BR>think the reason is they taunt like normal spells, only b/c of my casting system, I?m casting on 6<BR>people every 3 seconds, which is slightly higher than 6 people 3 times an hour.  To explain: I<BR>don?t consider it much of a plane raid if I don?t get DT?d, and in most grouping situations, mobs<BR>that join the fight halfway through pick me as their first target.  I kind of expect that, but here?s<BR>the extent is goes to:<BR>	I?m with a large group in plane of fear (35-40 people); we?re getting ready to kill Cazic. <BR>So we pull one of his Dread/Fright/Terror golems, and of course CT begins Dting us, the puller<BR>goes down right away, and the secondary pulls to the group.  Knowing my taunt value I hold<BR>back, I don?t play any songs right away, and I don?t join in the melee at first either.  People have<BR>been hitting for a bit, they?ve done damage, so I begin singing, feeling safe.  One pulse of<BR>manasong, (I?m about to join the melee), the 30 seconds from Cts Dting the puller are gone and<BR>he can do it again.  BAM!  I?m dead.  Not the secondary puller, not any of the tanks, not any of<BR>the nukers, not any of the healers, but the little bard who played Chorus of Clarity once.  I can<BR>except that CT is not a music lover, but I?d like to know if our taunt is meant to be that bad (this<BR>sort of thing happens all the time).<BR>Well Ab, sorry for any incoherence or Polonian brevity.

</FONT><HR>I think that the major thing which bards NEED before 50 is to have our hide skill be given the power to evade such as the rogues. But because we do not get hide skill until the 20s and it only caps at 55, the evade would NOT infringe at all upon the rogues evade power since their hide caps at like 200. Abosr, you seam to need explanations of why our suggested changes are needed to balance. Well lets see, bards have hp at the lvl below any melee type(yet we melee, well some) and our songs have the most ungodly high taunt lvl. We need a way before post 50 to bring down our hate, which the evade skill would greatly accomplish. The low cap on hide would make it for needed situations in groups when we taunt more than the other three or two tanks. We are a grouping class and this change would help us do our "Vision" better. <P>P.S. have your artists look at some drums...last time i saw one they were not a stick=) (please fix this bug, it has been in game for SO long)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Duncan...<P>Defensive skills means Defense, Parry, Riposte...the collection of things that keep us alive longer, not just the strait defense skill.<P>The need for bards to have better defense skills is something that becomes much more apparent -later- in life not sooner.  Levels 10-25 or so, bards get hit more than other hybrids because of their songs, but thats true throughout our life.  But at those levels, hybrids don't really have a lot we lack skillwise.  Both of us have defense and dodge.  Their AC is a chunk higher because they have shields and we drop them at 17 or so, but we can be relatively similar.  The gap between our defense, and their defense grows when THEY add on parry, riposte, etc -and- we hit our lower defensive caps while they do not.  <P>While this is happening, monster power also increases substantially.  But, our songs still draw the attention of basically everything.  <P>So we are getting hit a ton, yet our defensive skills are not rising to help us counter the fact that we're getting hit very hard or more often by monsters (as they gain double attack, dual wield, quad attacks, and massive str bonuses).<P>Up to 50, this wasn't impossible.  Verant reduced the ammount of hate our songs brought us in a party once before kunark came out...which helped.  Also, old world big monsters just didn't hit like kunark monsters or velious monsters of the same level.  Yes, planar pulls would often kill us dead right off the bat while the enchanters messed things, but that can be the puller's fault.  Those kinds of pulls still really mess us up though, in point of fact.<P>So, at level 50 we have no parry no riposte yet, and relatively poor dodge cap, and good defense skill, plus plate...somewhat lower ac compared to others, but a)gear does not make a class and b) someone has to be bottom of the hybrid pyramid.  Its us, deal.<P>ENTER the 50+ game.  We get parry at 53 (cap 75) and Ripost at 58 (cap 75).  Thats it for our real defense skills.  Monster power on the other hand, SKYROCKETS.  Kunark mobs hit harder, velious mobs hit harder.  They both hit really fast.  They get new special skills.  They quad attack too.  Some are unmesmerizeable.  What this means is that bards take a PUNISHING pounding because everything locks onto us, and our defensive skill collection has not improved to balance the new monsters.  Our AC is not great but its plate, our HPs are the lowest.  <P>I don't want bigger defensive skills to sit there with monster attention and 'tank'.  I want bigger defensive skills to SURVIVE THE CASTING TIME on my cleric's healing.  <P>Bards are the only class that I know who can -stand- in the middle of a raid group, swing no weapons, attack no monsters, and have multiple monsters attack them -first-.  The result of that is usually dead bard or OOM cleric then dead bard, depending on how long it takes enchanters to sort it out.  Add new, stronger, quad attacking, frenzied, unmesmerizable monsters to that mix - and you get more dead bards who can literally expect to die just by standing still singing manasong.<P>I really want to see the bardic defensive skills get their caps raised.  I don't expect to take as much punishment as the SK/Pally by any stretch, and I would also expect to go down faster than the ranger (after all, they are expected to be front line melee, and they pay defense for their offense.  I'm not expected to deal damage nor take it on Pally/SK scale)<P>What I do expect though, is that I should be able to outlast a druid in a beating contest.  That's just not so currently.<P>I hope you can see that it's not the low level game where bards suffer - I think we're solid there personally.  It's life after 50 that we are just not scaled for...neither our songs nor our skills are scaled for 50+ and since we don't get replacements or cap increases...I think we suffer for it in life expectancy and party effectiveness/groupability.<P>-Nadira Andante<BR>Bard of Rallos Zek<BR>Coin only loot already exists, but only for the attackers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The classes closest to being a 'jack of all trades' are the druid and the necromancer; not the bard.  <P>Don't use the a bard is a 'jack of all trades' argument when balancing bards; it isn't currently true.<P>--------------<P>MISCONCEPTION 2:  "Bards effects should be weaker to offset the fact they are not limited by mana"<P>  The effectiveness of bard effects should be based on the number of simultaneous effects a that can keep up over time, as well as how many can be done at once (i.e. 1000 damage in 1 sec, then 99 sec of downtime is signficantly better than 10 damage a sec for 100 sec)<P>  One thing that is not often pointed out, is that a for a bard to use a debuff, he has to drop 4-6 buffs... that means any debuff is 4-6 times more 'costly' than a buff.  <P>  All bard effects should be balanced at each level with the equivilant mana cost for a caster's spell.<P>  For example, if a enchanter regains 18 mana every 6 seconds... (3 a second), and casts a 450 mana spell that lasts 1 hour (3600 seconds), this would result in (3600*3)/(450) == 24.  This means a this spell take 1/24th of an enchanters continual maintenance.<P>  For a bard, it is reasonable to manage 3 combat buffs (full time) and 1 non-combat effect (half time).   In a 6 person group, I will assume that 4 people benefit from the melee buffs, 2 benefit from the non-melee (i.e. mana song).  This means a bard has (3*4*1)+(1*2*.5) buffs active... or 13 total..., this means each of a bards buffs take 1/13th of his continual maintenance.<P>  In this example, it would imply that a bard is roughly 55% as effective at maintaining a number of buffs over time.  Despite the facts that a bard's songs are 'free', an enchanter comes out ahead beacuse what he 'pays' in mana is more than offset by what he 'earns' in meditation.<P>The higher efficiency, longer lasting, post-50 buffs (even post-40) abiltiies really weaken the use of a bard within a party.  These abilties need to be re-evaluated in the context of how many effective buffs are maintainable.<BR>  <BR>-------------<BR>3.  MISCONCEPTION 3:  'Bards are Group Friendly'<P>  Ok, maybe an overstatement, but not by much.  One thing that makes a class 'group friendly' is specialization.  A rogue does not need to tank if a warrior is there; and a warrior and rogue together are better than 2 of either.  <P>  A Paladin is less 'group-friendly' than a Warrior primarily because he is less specialized.  He can play *more* roles, but any particular role he is less good in.  This makes Paladins well suited to smaller groups where the flexibility ise useful, but less valuable for larger ones, where specialization is better.<P>  Almost anything a bard can do can be done better by another class.  This makes bards less useful in a full group, where specialization is key.  What catches bards is their effects are not driven by the number of people in a group, so the effciency described above goes *down* in less than a 6 man group.<P>  Another way of statiung this is: what that makes a class group friendly is synergy.  A warrior with a cleric can benefit greatly from a cleric's buffs; a paladin, less so.  In a party, only the best effects really count... a warrior might be a (10-tank), a paladin might be a (8-tank, 4-healer, 4-buff), but with a cleric (10-healer, 7-buff), his skills don't help.  A cleric/warrior group might be a (10-tank, 10-healer, 7-buff) group, where a cleric/paladin would be a (8-tank, 10-healer, 7-buff) group.  <P><BR>  Looking at the above, it seems that bards are best in large, far from optimally balanced, groups, which is certainly what my experience is.  In a large reasonably put together group, in a multi-group situation, or a small group, bards are usually *not* the best choice.  That's not exactly what I call party friendly.<P>--------<BR>ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:<P>Bards debuffs and crowd control are weakened by the fact that they lose 4-12 effective buffs to do these.  This makes them comparitively less usefull in big fights (when it really matter!).<P>Bard buffs are far less reliable.  Stuns, Link death, real death, lag, being spread out, or just being AFK cause them to drop.<P>Bard buffs have much less scope.  They can't effect pets, nor can they help multiple parties.<P>Bards need to be evaluated in light of these limitations.  There should be a corresponding benefits for these problems.<P><BR>SUMMARY:<BR>Bards need to be balanced in terms of sustainable <BR>effects.  Generalizations like 'it doesn't cost any mana', or 'you are a generalist', 'you are better than most classes in parties' should really be examined.<P>It may turn out on this basis if you plug the actual numbers in (I just invented some) that bards are *too* strong at points.  Balancing works both ways... just make sure you are balancing based on real comparisons, not on unverified assumptions.<P>---&gt; My feeling is that for a long time (~35ish) bards are fairly well balanced.  At lower levels taunts should possibly be decreased, and maybe add more defensive abilities (like songs) earlier.<P>----&gt; My feeling is that 35-50, bards start to slowly fall behind other support classes as they get longer lasting, more effective buffs; and they get more access to +int/wis gear that boosts maximum burn effectiveness.  (i.e. a caster with 200 int can do more in a single fight than a caster with 120 int, even thought hey can't do more on average... however, a lot of the game begins to revolve around occasional rare-spawn tough fights.)<P>----&gt; My feeling is that post-50 bards fall behind significantly, as other caster spells become massively longer lasting and effective.<BR>A level 50 bard doing a mana song is not noticably less effective than a level 55 bard doing mana song (which occupies much of our lives).  A level 55 warrior seems to be much, much tougher than a level 50 warrior.<P><BR>SUGGESTIONS:<BR>a) reduce the taunting of songs under 30th level (after that, you do crowd control and mez them...)<P>b) increase lower level dodge caps, and add parry as a lower level skill.<P>c) Upgrading bard songs 35-50 to be slightly more effective<P>d) significantly increase the effectiveness of bard songs post-50 to bring them in line with 50+ caster effects.  This would involve changing the formula's for bard so effectiveness to be non-linear after 50.<P>e) add some combo songs that increase the number of effective buffs a bard can have going, keeping resists the same as the single effect songs (i.e. the combo should always be better than the single effect.)  This effect should scale with the increased duration of caster effects.<P>f) make bard songs stackable with other caster effects.  There is no point in having a group class that doesn't play well with other group members.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Out of curiosity ... I really do not go out of my way to find oxymoronic thoughts that Verant creates ... but how the hell can anyone consider a Bard a "group class", when it is not the "choice" for many groups when damage output is needed ... read Creediki's posts ... you don't think that a Level 60 Bard that has done (probably) more raids and Gods and Dragons than anyone else wouldn't know?<P>I suppose that one way that Verant could make us usefull in these high areas, would be to give us a nice debuff song with a really low taunt factor, and few resists, so that a Bard is wanted, in those groups ... in other words, the debuffing would offset the damage differential between a Bard/Rogue, Bard/Paladin, Bard/Ranger and so forth. If the cap can't be given a Bard loophole (with no Bard on Bard stacking), then give us one in the bottom end of the critter that works, instead of it being resisted so much and then when the Bard finally gets one debuff in, will get itself killed immediately!<P>Come to think of it, a more effective Mana Drain song would be most welcome in these places. No one wants to see Vox'ie heal herself, or any other baddie!<P>This whole thread reminds me of another FoH'r that this game would not listen to either ... a Ranger! <P>Sad, real sad!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The others would remain at their old caps.<P>That way SOME bards would be good for picking locks while others might be good at disarming traps. Bards would not replace rogues in this area, but if you REALLY needed a lockpicker, there might be a case where a bard would be able to fill in.<P>-Iustus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A change that isnt as important as the bard haste issue, but still important is one of player's pet interaction with bard songs...Currently there is *none*.<P>As a pet wielder (if verant considers a necro a pet class haha), that groups with bards a lot of the time, it is very upsetting that bard group songs do not affect my pet.  A bard could affect my pet with a song that directly targets the pet... but in a 5-6 person group that is a waste of the bards songs.  Personally I feel that a group's pet should be considered part of the group for ALL group spells.  This in no way helps a pet class be stronger ungrouped/solo! and instead enchances all groups that have a pet class and a class that can cast group spells/songs (many).  In particular bard's are *supposed* to be the ultimate group player, so, certainly their group songs should effect group pets!<P><BR>--Mordsith<BR>59 Defiler<BR>19 Warrior</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My suggestions for bard balance:<P>1. Just a "little" more melee damage. Then what is done currently even when "fully buffed".<BR>2. Higher level songs should have a little<BR>more strength in the buff and effectiveness category.<BR>/// My personal "VISION" for what a bard should be///<BR>Is getting to the point where I can actually just play my instruments during a major group battle or situations. More then relying on my melee skills.<BR>To get to that point the songs need to be stronger, especially when an instrument is involved.<BR>I also beleive that "twisting" was not "intended" to be what it has turned out to be.<BR>I would much rather battle and use a song or two .. maybe three depending on the situation. Rather then having to constantly twist, in every situation all the time to get the maximum potential of my songs to a group to support them.<P>This is dreadfully complex at times, when you are trying to do the best possible job for a group.<P>I beleive that bards should not have to be so damn busy all the time.  Bards are there for group morale, they should be "CHATTING, and entertaining and JOKING, and lifting the spirits of a group. NOT twisting like mad until they are physically exausted with carpal tunnel IRL.<P>.. I would also like to see items that enhance ( SINGING).. ..<P>One other point.... LATER in levels. The usage of bards does seem to lack a bit, but I can not comment further becuase I am not qualified to since I just started in on the late levels.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Draelon says, "I don't see how summoning 5 or 10 or 20 at a time would imbalance anything"<P>Just 1 quick response...sorry, Draelon - that would tread upon the magician's realm, even if it is only summoning mundane items between combat.  Magicians are required to go through pain-staking research to get Everfont (summoning stack of water), and Corucopia must be either researched or purchased *only* in Qeynos.  Why should bards get that for free (summoning FULL stack) on an item?  Don't mean to sound pissy but it's a pain in the butt collecting items for these spells when you want the same thing.

</FONT><HR>One other thought on class balancing:<P>Some Bard songs (party buffs, regens and travel songs) increase in power in proportion to the number of people in a group.  E.g., singing healing costs the same in time spent whether a Bard is singing healing for one or singing healing for six, but in the latter case, he will be doing up to six times as much healing for the same cost.<P>It is not reasonable to balance these songs by looking at a Bard in an ideal 6-person party in an ideal location and then ensuring that the Bard effect is no better than the effect that another class can give.  That is a sure-fire way to guarantee that Bards won't be balanced, both because:  a) they won't always be with six people, b) they will rarely be in an ideal location, c) they will almost never have an ideal party makeup.<P>Absor's comment on the 5% haste add from the level 50 song ("[It] could easily be argued that a 5% haste, in the right party, could provide more damage than the bard's blades") illustrates this point.  I can imagine a party where a bard putting away his instruments and singing a 5% stackable haste would result in more melee damage.  But:  1) other than an almost-pure melee party, I can't;  2) a pure melee party would benefit much more from the bard continuing to melee and singing some alternative;  3) songs are SUPPOSED to augment party performance, not just be barely better than break-even in a very skewed maximum-sized group.<P>The level 50 haste add is laughable.  The level 60 haste add is debatably useful perhaps at level 50, but not for a level 60 song, especially given that others in the group are going to be max-haste already.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Forgot to add my solution for the summoning bard boots above....how about summoning no rent booze? Definitely a non-combat perk - people are so charmed by your tales and songs that they buy you free drinks.

</FONT><HR>Maybe I can bring a key issue into focus, here. You say:<P>  There has to be a pretty serious limitation on<BR>  songs ('free' is always a dangerous thing when<BR>  you are talking balance).<P>The druid's first level snare is FREE.<P>If all the druid does is snare one mob at a time, a level 23 (same as Bard song) druid with breeze easily recovers all the mana used in snaring before he has to snare again.<P>This is compared to a bard continually recasting snare, because he doesn't know how long it is going to last. And then, the snare occasionally lasts less than 4 seconds, so he doesn't get it off again in time, and the mob gets to move. The mob also FREQUENTLY resists - another reason the bard must continually use snare if he wants to approach the effectiveness a Druid has for free.<P>It's probably worse than that. At level 30, the Druid can probably do a heck of a lot more than just throw his first level snare, and still recover all the mana before the duration runs out. The Bard will always be frequently resisted, and the duration will always allow for it to wear off before he can recycle the effect.<P>Plus wear and tear from repeatedly hitting the key, and watching for missed notes, or stuns interrupting the song, or Linkdeath.<P>You've got to stop thinking of everything the Bard does as "free". He can only do three "free" things at once. At level 50, casters can do *many* free things at once with Clarity 2. THIS is where the balance should be measured, if it has not been.<P>I have grouped with a level 26 enchanter who kept 4 mobs mezzed for free. He medded between casts, and stood up when something needed to be pinned down again. And he didn't keep it mezzed PART of the time - he kept it mezzed ALL of the time. And he breezed the other casters, too, and debuffed the mob MR. We kept this up for over 20 minutes straight. At level 26, not 50.<P>I'm spending too much time making my point. I hope you eventually read this.<P>Also:<P>1. Songs are short; spells are long (and usually more effective, too). Please change it so that songs never overwrite spells, and spells always overwrite songs. If they stack, that's great.<P>2. Buffing as a primary role becomes less and less useful as groups acquire better and better equipment, and soft caps are reached. This applies to stats, resists, and haste.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Okay, I have a 40 bard and for the most part, I think they're fairly well balanced.  VI has done a good job with them. They're VERY powerful if you have the patience to play the class.  <P>However, while I don't think we need any neew songs, I think the biggest problem with bards is that the spells currently in game need to be fixed.  I haven't played my bard in 8 months so I don;t know what's still broken with them.<P>Mez spell - This NEEDS to be fixed.  I can understand if it's not intended to work on high level mobs, but there is no reason why a levbel 60 bard using it should have more failures with it than a level 25 bard.  Resist rates go up as you level.  There is  absolutely no reason why a level 60 bard should be getting 80% resists on a level 1 snake, when a level 25 bard gets almost no resists.  Can't you see why this is broken?<P>Pixie Strike - I think this was partyially fixed with a recent patch, but if not, the resists need to be lowered.  It's only like a 10 second stun, and many bards want to use it for crowd control, but it breaks/resists too much.<P>Bard should have better luck with crowd control, their roles in groups need to be to reduce downtime and to do secondary acts instead of dishing out damage.  More bards should be using spells and trying to assist the groups in ways other than fighting.  Better instruments should be put in.  I was AMAZED when I found out that our epic weapon was a freaking sword instead of an instrument.  Hello?  We're BARDS, not warriors.  Our focus should be on instruments.<P>And for the LOVE OF GOD, fix the drum animation!  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bards are notoriously long winded. 'Tis our nature and evident by the typically lengthy posts. At the same time, we are very accurate in our expressions.  I read roughly 1/4 of the thread and saw nothing but reiteration after reiteration of what was so clearly and aptly put forth by one of the first posts reprinted from the Concert Hall.  (BTW, bless the Concert Hall for all its efforts.  The site is a haven and a font of information for all bards.) For any changes/corrections needed to the class, I stack my opinion 100% behind that early post.<P>I quit my bard at level 30. It took me 6 weeks to get out of my first hell. I quit the game for 2 months. I came back to play an enchanter and then the exp re-balance took place. I raised my bard to 35 and have noticed such a difference I must say, that one patch alone saved EQ from losing another bard.  There are issues that need to be addressed, certainly.  I get the impression now that bards are getting a bit more attention from VI and that is much appreciated.  Reread the old post (sorry, I cannot recall the poster's sign-in, but it is the first long post on page 1) thoroughly and consider each point, weighing them based on the order addressed. It really is a perfect reflection of the general bard's needs.<P>Thank you,<BR>Meilikki Lightspeed<BR>Renewed Bard of 35 Songs</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I was recently at a Naggy raid and afterward was watching our rogue do Corpse recovery for us doing sneak/hide right into Naggy's lair pulling corpses out from under his nose. I'm a wood elf bard and I have both sneak and hide but it does not even vaguely resemble the skill of a rogue. At lvl 1 a halfling rogue can sneak/hide from rivervale past the orcs in highhold pass to High keep with no trouble at all. What is the point of having the sneak skill at all if we can't sneak/hide at the same time like rogues.  Many bards worship Bristlebane the King of Thieves, including my self, but what is the point if we can't be sneaky like rogues.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I apologize if this has already been complained about, but I wasn't aware of it being discussed:<P>Is it really intentional that the two Ervaj songs (Melody at level 50 and Composition at level 60) don't stack with a bunch of really useful bard songs that have nothing to do with haste? They don't stack with: a) The whole psalm series (singing resistance spells sometimes with a damage shield and also have a minor AC buff) b) Elemental Rythyms and Purifying Rythyms (again resists with a minor AC buff) or c) Niv's Harmonic (ac only debuff). Both of the Ervaj songs give some AC buff, I suspect that this prevents these other songs from stacking, which is a shame since on most of them the AC buff is very minor, including on the Ervaj songs.<P>Clavicus, Maestro of Hoss, Druzzil Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>On the SS armor summoning food and water issue.<P>Just get rid of it! I have no use for first level Magician spells. Bards dont need that at all. 80 muffins and 80 water cost about 2pp. I have never used more then half that amount before I was encumbered with coins and loot and had to sell anyway. Foods so cheap I dont even summon it with my Mage, its easier to buy food that doesn't disappear. We always have forage as a back up too. Running to a vender is no big deal anyway because we can run so fast. I can cross most zones in a minute or less. <P>Eye of zom on the helm is an insult. You guys know very well that spell is useless. Why give high level Bards a useless spell? Just change them to some minor hp buffs or other spells. Ultravision, IVU, guard, gate, something USEFULL. Something fun that you would look foward to getting. That armor is way to heavy for such crappy effects. The only piece thats really good is the gauntlets. The BP is cool for the AC only. Considering it comes off Trak though it should be very, very good.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053745-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053745&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053745&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
