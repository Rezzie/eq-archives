I must admit that I don't really expect to see too many suggestions. The warrior seems to be a well balanced class. And we have to keep in mind that the warrior is a sort of staple class, upon which the relative balance of several other classes hinges directly.<P>So this is the forum to talk about what is right and what is wrong with warriors. Go ahead and tell me about bugs you've seen too. I'm not focusing on them, I'm concentrating on class balance here. But I will also take note of non-balance concerns as well.<P>Have at it, muscle-bound-types.<P>Alan<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well it is rather sad that I am actually replying in now the fifth warrior discussion. There are lots of great suggestions and comments from warriors or all levels and severs here in the many replies, as well as many good comments from non-warrior players who are concerned about their class.  <P>I have a regular group that I play with. We aren’t a guild in terms of the game but have been playing games together since Doom came out. Our group dynamic and coordination is superb in virtually all games we play. Everquest has become an addiction of us for nigh on two years now. Only one other game has ever done this to us but I am not here to discuss that.<P>Now that I have given some background information what I would like to talk about is how our group works with its balance. We have what I believe to be the perfectly balance group for non-planer hunts. We have our Cleric, Enchanter, Warrior (myself), Paladin, Monk, and Ranger. We have consistently hunted mobs in dungeons where the mobs are either 5 levels above our average level or where one of the other classes needs a quest item (we play on test now and there aren’t item campers like on prods).  We all have our defined places in the group; the castors do their thing, the monk pulls and deals out massive damage, the ranger pulls at times as well, snares (as important at times as mez), and grabs mobs off of the castors, the paladin does much the same as the ranger but also has LoH for those times the cleric is out of mana and helps top off health to keep the hunts moving, and I am there to take hits and deal damage while finding and staying on the toughest (to my discretion) mob there.  This has been very effective.<P>What I have run into twice now (on the prods and again on test) is the fact that around level 30 I begin to lose my advantage in all areas but hp’s.  My ac is now below that of the paladin (he has all his quest armor given to him from a higher char he has), the ranger out damages me even while I have a weapon that I could not attain even in a group hunt (she is usually one or maybe two levels above me), and I have a difficult time keeping the main mob on me so that the hybrids can do their jobs. <P>Now I am not necessarily opposed to the changes that were made to the high levels for hybrids in regards to offensive and defensive skill caps. And I really agree with the exp penalty change because it actually helps me by not having them leach exp from me, the only real balance changes I would like to see that would be in what I see as the Vision™ is more equipment that is warrior only, drops relatively frequently, and is spread out through out the levels so that every warrior isn’t wearing the same looking items from level, well 2 on prods and 30 on test, to level 50+. It’s boring and no good warrior will give up plate absorption for chain mail (clerics don’t want to heal us that much).  And as tired as this is, a taunt increase in either a added skill we can work up or differing math for it we need to be able to grab a mob the instant it is necessary (hybrids will still be able to taunt away from us but shouldn’t want to have the mob hitting them, they have castors to protect).<P>I have been reading a majority of the posts of the previous 4 threads and now this LONG post is my reply.<BR>Gantores<BR>Warrior <BR>Test, where real EQ is played<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, since hybrids can tank almost as well as a Warrior, I'd love to see some nice additions to Warriors.<P>AE Taunt would DEFINE warrior class making it desired over Pali and SK (that both have methods of healing themselves and others). OR ability that taunts all mobs within short range onto warrior with long reload - main purpose: to taunt stuff off all casters and get warrior killed (or really beaten) while saving group (or for wiz/druid to get evac off).<P>Ability that gives group members within a few feet Yaulp.<P>Ability (maybe called intimidate) that lowers targets AC and or some stats (think of it as big ugly warrior screaming at the mob).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

You'd think a warrior roaring/howling would put a scare into someone.<P>Also some sort of +atk +ac discipline that works on all group members (sort of like that barbarian ability 'battle orders' in Diablo 2)  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I just have to add my two pp to this one-sided debate.  <P>The reason warriors are upset about the changes to the hybrids, as I see it, is not that hybrids are getting new spells, discipline, skills and other advancements. I think most warriors, especially those +50, would agree that this is good for all melee types. The issue is that these changes, though not affecting warriors directly, change the FUNDAMENTAL way the warrior community views itself.  <P>We made a decision to choose a class that has no magical abilities. None. No spells, no easy escapes like Gate (An over-balancing spell if there ever was one but that is another discussion) and no methods for healing ourselves save grouping or binding wounds like every other character in Norrath. We chose that sort of character. In exchange for no spells we would have the ability to use all weapons skills at some level or another and have the highest offensive and defensive ratings.  This was a fair trade-off.  We were dependent on the group and our much-loved clerics and in exchange we were the best at what we did.<P>By giving Paladins and Shadowknights the same defensive skills as warriors it changes that fundamental agreement. By making Rangers our equals in offensive skill it changes our long held belief that it was okay that we can’t heal ourselves; that it is okay magic users 20 levels below us can safely traverse areas we fear travel alone – because we were the best at what we did.  No attributes were taken from warriors. We have the same skills as before.  But our fundamental sense of that which we are as a class has changed. <P>Increase the defensive skills of Paladins and Shadowknights – but keep it below the warrior by even an insignificant amount.  Increase the offensive skill of the Ranger but keep it below the warrior.  <P>It is easy to quantify skill levels because they are numerical. Less easy to quantify are the values given a class by their skills (LOH, HT, Track and Sow) and spells (Healing, buffs and DOTs). They may not be perfect and they may not be the equals of the parent class spells but they certainly represent some level of significant gain by those Hybrid classes. Are they equal in value to the combat abilities gained by warriors through critical hits, crippling blows, higher skill levels and disciplines?  I speak for myself but I truly thought it was a fair exchange. Spells for skills.<P>If warriors are a staple class then you must realize that changes in the basic skills DO affect warriors as a class. If there is no benefit to not using magic they why bother?  I don’t want to play a magic user class. I want to be a warrior. I made a decision to forgo using magic because it let me do best what I liked in EQ – pure melee. An insignificant Hit Point difference and equal Armor Class do not equal the abilities inherent in the various hybrid classes.<P>Warriors are not upset that hybrids are getting improvements. Most warriors will agree that something needed to be done. Warriors are upset that by making such drastic changes, especially in the skill levels, you are changing the fundamental and defining elements of the warrior class. <P>Now, don’t even get me started on Disarm and the Cobalt drop rates………<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well I know that nothing we post id going to get a response, doesnt even seem we can manage a simple onliner off No anymore. But just because I have been reading the posts, I'm bored and I want to express my opion here is my views.<BR>Disarm..ok realistically this makes no sense. So you have this axe weilding manic coming after you and he manages to chop your arm off..well that hurt alot right? So while your bleeding to death you kick the axe out of his hand and he hits you again, ok didnt hurt that bad this time did it. This is a problem I have with the game, if I manage to disarm something how come it still hits as hard or harder then before, just makes no sense to me at all.<BR>Taunt..just give it a boost or something. Personally I'm against the AOE taunt I could see alot more damage being done useing it at times then not. I'm not totally against it but just don't think it would be a good idea.<BR>Colbalt drops..really don't have to say anything about that I just know that being 43 I might luck out with a peice or two by the time I hit 60.<BR>Really would like to see somemore Warrior only gear and please make that no drop so I dont have to buy it off a druid. Think about it how many warriors do you see in crafted about everyone of them.<BR>You know not seeing any posts commenting on the things us warriors have posted, even a yes or yeah right your already balanced just makes me want to stop playing after a year and a half.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok 1st and foremost, giving rangers equal offense and giving sk/paly equal defence doesnt make warriors any worse.  Notice that neither hybrid can do both, AND warriors still have better defenseive and offensive skill like critical hits, more parry, more dodge and most hps. And dont even make me start on the disc.  Warriors get a full list of very usefull disc, which is more than could be said for all the hybrid disc combined.<BR>And on top of all that, warriors also recive an exp bonus! to compinsate for the fact they dont have spells, which in my mind is totally not needed but does exist.  <BR>The point of balancing is to make all equal not to make all more powerfull, because that would still leave all the clases unbalanced.  Warriors were and still are the undisputed tanks and warriors also do very very good melee damage even compared to rogues and monks.  I see no problem at all with warriors, i have never seen a group decline a warrior over any other melee class, which is more than what could be said for hybrids.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My own suggestion would be to bring two warrior skills, one offensive and one defensive, to the theoretical max (60*5+5=305) or another reasonably high number.  Not all of them, perhaps just one type.<P>Another idea i think is worth looking into is specialization.  You could give warriors a weapon specialization similar to casters whereby they pick one weapon type with which they specialize, and have that skill cap way high so that with the weapon of their choice they can do greater damage.  This would have two advantages. 1, warriors would be much better taunters, thus eliminating the need for a taunt improvement.  2, it would make the warrior more of, well, a warrior, rather than a big lump that gets hit a lot.<P>As for balance, raising one offensive and one defensive skill isnt so good, b/c some people dont like/use some weapon skills.  However the specialization idea befits warriors, and it would give warriors the fighting prowess they should have because they dont have magic.  I've played a warrior and believe me, not being able to snare or darkness a mob more than makes up for a few extra hp, 'cause its a far far better thing to be able to prevent trains than to be able to escape them, especially if your trying to solo.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The ONLY thing I can think of would be a skill similar to disarm that would break the armor or lower ac, or get an actual "crippling" hit that wounds the target, thereby disabling it's atk abilities.

WE ARE GROUP RELIANT !! if you make it so the hybrids can replace us more efficantly were really "screwed". we cant heal ourselves, our bind wound is pitiful. we cant solo post 40 as unlike the mobs we face, our skills are all capped by then.<P>add some new skills for petes sakes, were the prime mele ( i know not in EQ worlds but the idea of a warrior is a fighter) maybe give us a lvl 40 backhand slash skill, a added attach that kicks in more often as it goes up. a 45ish overhand slash skill on the same princaple maybe. ANYTHING to keep us as the mele we should be.<P>bottom line is, you are slowly makeing us tanks not needed, and i dont know if i can live knowing i was replaced by a ranger.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is a rather well wrote post by Thok_Smash i can feel his pain and I as a warrior feel just as upset so i am just going to repost his thoughts since i dont have his writing skills and grammer usage.<BR>"ABSOR: Also, I actually hope to see as many suggestions for 'nerfs' as for improvements. <BR>You ask the other classes for improvements, yet you ask us how we'd like to 'nerf' ourselves?<P>ABSOR: Keep in mind that the warrior is pretty much the base class, so it is very unlikely that we will be improving something that has any major effect unless it addresses some deficiency. <P>However, improving / adding things to the other classes is perfectly acceptable.<P>ABSOR: If not, then this might actually be one of those cases where we need to do a sort of give and take. <P>Give to the hybrids, take from the warriors.<P>ABSOR: I guess I'm saying that by their very nature, warriors just about have to be balanced, and an improvement to them might necessarily require a change to all other fighting classes to match them. And that's not really what I'm looking for. <P>Ok, fine. Warriors are the standard for melee. Why is there no standard for casters? Because they are different and hard to compare to one another? Gee, melee types are the same way, except that we're only looking at offensive and defensive skills. Never taking into account spells/items/skills/abilities/disciplines/race/level. <P>ABSOR: I really don't like the idea that warriors have so many spells available to them through items, especially things like invisibility. I intend to ask that these things be looked at. My suspicion is that they won't be removed, we don't like to do that. But as a matter of class balance, I think it should be looked at. <P>Warriors shouldn't have spells, that's not our style. Take them off our armor. Instead add something that is unique to warriors. The only unique thing we have is berserk. Make our armor reduce us to 30% hit points so we can berserk and show everyone that we are warriors. Warriors TANK. Meaning we stand there and take damage. Casters DO damage, we take it, cleric fixes it. So maybe our armor should proc something that does damage to ourselves. It's a good nerf and is something warriors are good at doing. Another stipulation would be that the proc must do damage to all shadowknights/bards/paladins since their tanking ability is equal to ours.<P>ABSOR: That's exactly the opposite of what the hybrids, monks and rogues say. A lot of them think that there is too wide of a gap between their hit points and/or armor class and that of a warrior, and they want more. <P>So give hybrids more hit points. Everyone was happy with it the first time they got more hit points. Let them wear our class specific armor. To 'balance' this, give us their spells. Not all of them, just the Stuns, Heals, Spirit of Wolf, lifetap and Snare. Since most Hybrids say their magic is not worth the combat skills they give up, they won't mind a bit if we get maybe 6 spells across 60 levels.<P>ABSOR: Actually, even if knights had exactly the same armor class and defensive skills as a warrior, they would be worse tanks, since they have noticeably fewer hit points. <P>Put a level 55 bard, a warrior, and a paladin each in front of a Myconid Warrior and tell me the which one is 'noticably' less effective as a tank. <P>ABSOR: I'll add this to the list too. But I disagree that warriors have some innate right to have the highest skill with all weapon types. <P>Thanks for stereotyping us into using swords.<P>ABSOR: We'll see. Boy, you people really don't like disarm. <P>No we don't. So don't lose any sleep over what to do with it.<P>ABSOR: The changes you see on test are not in any way going to make warriors obsolete. They will still have the best defense and offensive power (when compared to the hybrids). <P>When you consider offensive skill and defensive skill together, and use only those as the basis for comparison, yes.<BR>1. Warriors have the best defensive skill<BR>Paladins and Shadowknights are now equal, which means we are not the 'best.' Both classes have spells that make their defenses greater than ours. Maybe not in straight AC, but still many things to help relieve the defensive burden.<P>2. Warrior have the best offensive skill<BR>A ranger now has the same skills as us. Add in their Direct Damage and DoT's and they surpass us. This is not even mentioning Monks or Rogues.<P>ABSOR: They will still have a significant hit point advantage. <P>Yes we have more hit points, but whether or not it is 'significant' depends on the encounter.<P>ABSOR: They will still have the best armor and weapons, and the greatest versatility in equipment. <P>That is a pretty big claim. Our class specific armor has higher AC than others, but does that alone make it the "best"? <P>Our weapons are not the best by a longshot. Monks have far better weapons than we ever will. Look up 'Bo Staff of Trorsmang', 'Ton Po's Bo Stick of Understanding', 'Runed Fighters Staff', and 'Peace Bringer' for examples. If monks are so skilled with using their fists and not needing equipment to survive, then WHY do they have the best weapons in the game? Is that balanced?<P>As far as versatility, all high level warriors use fast, agro-proccing weapons. 99% of which are 1 handed slashing. If these type of weapons are not used, the group will constantly ask the warrior why he is not doing his 'job.' (taking the hits). Versatility to me means 'different.' If we all walk around with the same weapons because it is the only weapon combo that will keep MOB's agro on us, how different is that?<P>I'm not asking for any new dramatic improvements to the warrior class. However I would like to see this whole 'balancing' process done fairly. You said yourself, this whole process was a give and take situation. You have already given many many things to the other classes, why hasn't anything been taken away?"<P>Again this isnt my post but it pretty much shows the way i feel as well (Upset).<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Warrior xp bonus is an interesting notion that other classes always toss at you when you dare to mention desired improvements for the warrior class. I have two accounts, and as far as I have seen on the xp bars, both characters get the exact same movement on the bar...<BR>So this supposed xp bonus must be shared (if it even exists to begin with), so this bonus really is (if it exists) a compensation for the group for taking in a warrior (or??).<BR>As for playing the game without a single utility spell makes it hard to move around (and sometimes prevents you from reaching a waiting group). Hybrids talk about their spells as useless, but they dont contemplate how easy their spells make their life in Norrath (compared to warriors).<BR>I like the idea (as mentioned above) to let warriors specialize in a weapon skill and thus bring it up to a lvl where he clearly out melees hybrid fighters (hits harder and more often).<BR>I also would like to see more HP!!! (ok flame me)<BR>Taunt is ok (it is just that the hybrids have to learn to hold back on their damage and spells) at lower lvls, but after 50 it needs a boost.<BR>Let the hybrids do more combined damage (spells and melee) but let the warriors be the undisputed masters of melee...and TANKS.<BR>And finally but not the least, plz dont make all classes the same...<BR>Khaan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A few additional points.<P>As to the post of why we are repetitive, I see it as more people voicing dissatisfaction and increasing the possibility that the warrior issues will be looked into.<P>As to the mention that hybrid skill increases do not upset balance as warriors still have superior ripost, parry, dodge and disarm:<P>What good is riposte (an automatic return blow when a mob hits you) when mobs dont hit you since you cannot taunt them off of others.<P>What good is dodge for the same reason.<P>What good is parry for the same reason.<P>And disarm.  What a useless skill.  All it can do is increase a taunt possibility.  The only time I ever used it consistently was when I used to practice it against orcs in south ro.  I found then that my taunt skill would increase an average of 4 points before I would disarm an orc once.  Just think of how many taunts that took before it had effect.  Useless skill.<P>But perhaps I am looking at this wrong.  Perhaps we as warriors need to be recommending to group members what I have mentioned a couple of times in game, though I did so in a humorous manner.  Monks FD during fights more often.  Others, learn to turn off the auto attack key in the middle of the fight.  That way I, the 51 warrior, can get hit a couple of more times and perhaps not end as many fights at full hit points.<P>Suggestions I like but do not know what the game balance issues would be (that's what test is for, isn't it?):<P>- increase the taunt radius as gain levels.  Taunt is more effective closer to mob.  Make it more effective from a distance as go up in levels.<P>- AoE taunt - cool idea.  Perhaps it should be a level 50 discipline to make up for the crummy taunt abilities.<P>- lack of binds and trouble travelling - personally I think this should not be tampered with - to me it has been half the fun getting around the hard way.<P>- bind wounds.  It would be nice to see this increase a bit more as one goes from level 25 to 50.<P>- since warriors are defined by their armor and weapons, perhaps make those items that define other characters as hard to get (more plane raids to get the new high level dd spell, which drops off of one in a hundred mobs, and casters need to line up to get it).  This is a humorous suggestion as I personally would not like it since I need the casters to be able to do the big dd so that I, the lowly warrior, have a chance of being alive when we roll for that ultra rare armor drop that I need in order to survive a little longer.<P>All IMHO of course.<P>Ghag<BR>51 Warrior<BR>Torv</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here is one option I was thinking about for warriors as well, which the damage output would not be drastic considering the drawback involved.<P>Is it possible for the byond rare Warrior who LIKES using the classic sword and shield to be able to Bash and Kick with out resetting the other. Right now a warrior can either Bash or Kick, warriors can do both. The drawback is we lose the offhand weapon.. which is more than enough balance the balance issue.<P>This will also allow the use of Proc'ing shields. And this is more of a request. One of my favorite items in the game is the Shield of the Slain Unicorn. Can we have more of these types of weapons? I am talking more of graphics as well. A off hand weapon that LOOKS like a shield gives AC and is a weapon. I know of many Ac giving weapons but the SofSU is the only one that looks like a shield and is quite outdated at highers levels. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>It seems like warriors have given up on this class balance thing. I am experiencing the same feeling of defeatism that seems to be experienced by most warriors. I would like to say please don't give up trying to get a fair deal at least lets see if these changes go live.<P>But if they do, I am thinking of deleting my 45 days played warrior in protest and cancelling. After all, there are new games on the horizong, and I'm sure they will do a better job at melee combat. <P>When Verant sais increase defence skill to exactly the same as warriors, increase offence to exactly the same warriors, the message they are putting across is hybrids can tank exactly the same as warriors. If you are putting this message across, then why play a warrior? Why? Unlike the hybrids, tanking is the only thing we can do, we can do nothing else. Nothing.<P>As for the class armour look at it. The cobalt drops are so ultra rare, I have killed drolvarg captain 80 times, in that time I have had 79 mantles and 1 pair of cobalt gauntlets. And these went to a druid in our group! I was forced to buy them for 12k. And this is the most common piece. The bracer is so rare that its almost a myth. Is there any way that this armour can me made so that it actually drops? Can't you make it nodrop so at least a warrior can get it?<P>A warrior is so specialised for taking damage that reducing this ability relative to others makes us useless.

</FONT><HR>Oh don't mistake my post for not wanting to hear any more about it, I understand why it is being repetitive and I can agree whole-heartedly... I'd just like to have some sort of confirmation or even a slight note that someone is paying attention... even if it is a, "no, can't do that item, can't do that".<P>***TAUNT***<P>I'd like to see a group taunt, I play with an enchanter who likes to use his AE Mez... when it wears off he gets pasted.<P>I also group with a Shadowknight. It seems he is the tank in the party. Why? Despite my taunt being capped, me wielding dual langs and being hasted by above mentioned enchanter: the Shadowknight is the one who gains the attentions of the MOBs. I can out damage him (by a few points on average and by a lot if I score a crit) but that gets me one or two shots. All it takes is for the SK to cast one spell and the MOB is back on him... sure he can't take as many hits as I can, but it gets to a point where it's difficult to pull MOBs off him... or he is more successful at pulling MOBs off our enchanter friend. This makes it look as though I'm not doing my job.<P>Fortunately, the enchanter has played a warrior before so he understands... (BTW he gave up on warriors and moved on to casters)<P>***SKILLS***<P>Additionally, we need something that is ours and ours alone. I like the suggestion of the debuff (kind of like an armor break) and I've suggest something like a 'rage' in 3e. Just an extra kick of strength and speed (which saps stamina at a higher rate).<P>Someone might say that the casters don't really get many unique skills either but I'll refer you to the number of spells they get per level. Just something different or something that adds a little more strategy to the warrior class. <P>***GEAR***<P>More armor and weapon types would be appreciated. They don't need to be warrior only (though it might be nice to have some that is). Just different versions of banded, BI, plate (bronze) and maybe even different versions of some of the more popular weapons. The stats do not necessarily have to be better, just look different.<P>Weapons and armor are our spells... we don't get new ones every 4 levels so how about some variations? In fact, have them drop in the less popular dungeons to aid another issue you are finding with the game.<P>In truth, bronze armor (large) drops of creatures level 20+. It can be considered the 3rd step of armor (leather, banded, bronze). What rank of spells is a cleric on by that level? A necromancer? A magician? An enchanter? A, and this is one I think is another staple class, wizard? <P>They are on their 5th rank of spells.<P>If we don't have unique skills (since hybrids pretty much get each one... not all of them, but each hybrid has a spattering of them) please give us more interesting items to use.<P>Two handers for example, it's difficult to find one that looks cool AND does decent damage. Blackened Iron Bastard Sword... misnomer there, it's neither black (like blackened armor) nor is it a 'bastard sword'. <P>It's also disappointing to find out are all camped to death.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> You either have to pay an insane amount of platinum for one or try to get in on a camp and 'roll' for one.<P>Make more weapons of equal calibre drop in more places even make them lore, I just want more.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>If you left warriors completely untouched BUT gave us more - useful - content to choose from then I'd be pretty happy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>_-= TAUNT =-_<P>How many times is this going to be said/suggested/hinted at?  We need to be able to taunt.  We cannot taunt using a 2h weapon, those of us that want to, lose our group usefulness.  <P>EVERY TIME I am in a group with any other meleers and I use a 2h weapon I find myself getting the mobs attention only after I hit for 60-70 etc, then it turns on the ranger, monk, caster, rogue, etc etc. until I can land a good hit.  <P>I use 1hs weapons, and I can keep that sucker on me pretty well, slashx2 taunt slam disarm, viola mob is on me.  <P>So now we are at a point where a good 1hs weapon is not only a only choice for a warrior, but you pay an obscene amount of plat for it.  Where a good 2hs weapon (Mith2h) is a fraction of the cost.  <P>Please, Please, Please, increase the Warrior ability to taunt.  Not just high levels either, but just increase it.  We need to get mobs on us and keep them on us.  Some of the solutions I've read and thought were good ideas:<P>1) Make 2h weapons bump us up on the hate list faster, or farther than other melee attacks.<P>2) Make Taunt, for Warriors only, aggro slightly more than other taunting classes.  Maybe only adding some points on the hate list, but over the length of a fight it would help us.<P>3) AoE Taunt?  A button on a timer that lets you hit all mobs within 5-10 feet when you wield a 2h weapon, or just lets you taunt everything around you.<P>3a) YES, if you use this with an Enchanter, you are just not thinking.  If you use this with a necro casting ST, not thinking.  It would be something to learn to use.<P>My job as a tank is to get the beasties on me, get them to stay mad at me, and let the rest of my group kill them, while I do maybe 1/8th the damage of the whole group.

</FONT><HR>Short and to the point... Last few months hybrids have been recieving enhancements where as warriors have not. Hybrids recieved mana = to the equivilent caster giving them more spell casting power. Not only that but they have recieved more disciplines as well as enhancements to those disciplines. These enhancements have lowered the effectiveness of warriors due to the fact they have raised. <P>Disciplines are and issue with all classes. Why are there no disciplines that are class oriented. They all seam to be the same save for a few. Melee types all can pretty much all do some sort of enhanced damage or enhanced defensive manuver. Its repetitive and makes classes more melded not unique. Heres an idea to get the jest of what im talking about.<P>Rogues - Shadow Walk: allows for 30 seconds of unconditional invisibility. <P>Ranger - Nature's Ally: skill that gives rangers an AE charm to animals.<P>Warrior - Berserker Fury: AE attacks for 20 seconds doing criplings or criticals<P><BR>This is what im talking about. There are alot of ideas that i like (AE taunt, more HPs, more base AC value) and really think they should get looked into. Disciplines are my advancement for warriors in addition to those i listed in ().<P>Strahm Grymblade<BR>51 War~CN~Druzzil</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Actually, what I'd like to see for warriors in addition to some form of AE taunt would be a bit more flexable with thier disciplines. In my opinion, the disciplines of Defensive and Aggressive ought to be removed and placed on a NEW system. I'd suggest something like /style or /combatstyle or something along those lines.<P>The way I'd suggest it would work is at some levels, Warriors are allowed to adopt a new fighting style and maintain it as long as they choose... or at least for a good length of time. Some styles could be;<BR>Defensive: Same as what they have now. Damage delt is reduced (broken atm) and damage taken is halved.<BR>Aggressive: Again, same as at 60. Damage delt is increased (broken atm) and damage taken is increased (ie, they get beat like rangers)<BR>Berserk: All criticals are cripple, 15% bonus to hit points (can result in death if warrior is on these added hp at time disc ends), Bonus to atk rating, Dodge/parry/ripote inactive.<BR>Take Charge: Group based style. Warrior increases the attack accuracy of the entire party, as well as some bonus to defence.<P><BR>My suggestion would be for these styles to last around 30 second when they are earned, and the duration increases with level up to perhaps 5-7 minutes... or more. Likewise, their reuse time may start around 20min and decrease with level. At best, perhaps the warrior would need 3 minutes of non-styled combat to rest/prepair for next use. A more ideal way would be for a warrior to be able to adopt one of these styles for as long as he chooses, but limit the ability to flipflop between them at will. <P>They would be on a seprate timer from Disciplines, and could be used at the same time. For example, aggressive with Fell Strike.<P>They would also be gained at earlier levels, perhaps starting as low as level 10 with berserk?<P>Just some thoughts.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ok yes.. warriors are undisputed as the best tanks... but there is a thin line between us and hybrids and it gets thinner every day we are left behind, heres a few things i wanna address.<BR> 1. We do not get bind or gate because we are warriors, we cannot travel cause we didnt really need to in the old continent, but verant there are 3 continents out, dont you think that our ability to travel needs to expand as the continents do???<P> 2. ok and to that AE taunt, i think its a bad idea. if you have ae taunt you get like 3 things on you at the same time, but the problem is deeper than that, its that we do not have the hp or defense to handle those kinda beatings, there is a problem in the taunt, but there is also a problem in our defense and hp.. you can look at it 2 ways, either warriors are underpowered or the mobs are overpowered, in both cases something needs to change.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Also, I think there is a misconception that Warriors are well balanced. I have seen monks same level as me having the same armor class. Their hps arent as good but then again they have mend wounds. So lets just add 1/3 of thier total hps onto thier max. They dont have the hps all the time but they do when they need it, same with warriors. Except with warriors, they see what they get. Warriors are completely based on armors and weapons. Not 1 or 2 items completes a warrior. Its an entire package. Other classes are somwhat still efficient without any items. A good warrior depends on gear so when you say that warriors are well balanced, you actually mean "Nice gear bub". <P>Also, take note that an SK or Pally can tank as good as a warrior if he equiped himself like a warrior dose. Strait AC value on armor. The best warrior armors in the game matched with the best SK/Pally armors would come out about equal. Warrior ahead by a few. Match that small gain in AC value with all spells and pets that the SK and Pally get up to 60 and tell me if warriors are really balanced... i think not.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Most things have been said already.  As a 56th warrior here are a couple tid-bits of suggestions.<BR>1.  Lower the reuse time on some disciplines.  Or increase length of use per lvl increase or make a bigger difference in the amount taken off for reuse per lvl gained.<BR>2.  Taunt should not count and need a recycle time if we happen to hit it and the Mob is out-of-range.  This requires a whole new cycle time to get another chance to taunt.  I believe if the mob is out of range, it should work like archery skill.  <BR>3.  Warriors should have a natural higher hitpoint regeneration.  We have more hitpoints, it would make sense that we regain hps a little bit faster then a caster of the same level.<BR>4.  Crippling blows should have a more noticable stun component added to it.<BR>5.  Bind wounds cap should be the same as monks through whole life span.<BR>6.  As stated before, Hybrids should not have equal attack nor defense of warriors.  I can agree with some increases but not to the same level as us.  We gave up so much to not cast spells through our whole life, it just not fair to make us hybrids that cant cast spells.<BR>Just a few ideas, I am sure I repeated others before...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
