</FONT><HR> <BR> Someone say "LockBox"? Locked and/or trapped chests are a good idea. It allows us to use and develop skills that we currently have little use for. <P>  Track skill for rogues? Why? There really is no good reason to allow us to do it. <P>  Sneak/Hide breaking on shop? Nah, just a bad idea. Rogues have a tuff time with this. Heck , If they won't sell to me half the time because I am a rogue, the other half they won't sell to me because of my race. (Half-elf)  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>  Damage Shields and thrown weapons? Sure it doesn't make sense, but is it really worth dealing with now. I'd rather see some poison skill refinements.<P>  Pit traps and false walls? Should be detectable with rogue detect traps. Maybe even shaded red to show up better.<P>  Rogues Setting traps?  Yawn. Why would you ever want to do this?  What advantage would it serve the calss as a whole. Sounds good, but you think poison is under used? Try implementing a balanced version of this skill idea. Don't waste time on it.<P>  Illusions holding up after zone? Unless this is also being applied as a result of changes to echanter illusions, not a needed change. There is plenty of time/space to apply illusions upon entering a zone in most cases. At worst you hide sneak on entering the zone and find a safe spot to apply your illusion. Also a good limitation on those items. They should be less effective than echanter spells.<P>  Range increase on thrown weapons? Excellent idea! <P>  Poison on range items? Still wouldn't make me want to suffer the indignity of hours of greenie smashing, but would add something to poison usefulness. <P>  Poison weapons for others? No. Enchanters should have first crack at anything like it. And we really don't need it. Besides it is not practical.<P> One idea I would like to put forth, is the idea of race/deity based skill branching. It may be impossible to implement in EQ, but I think it would be a great idea in a future VI project. <P> Race/Deity Skill Branching (RDBS) What is it? RDBS is a way to further define a charcter based on roleplaying choices made by the player at character generation. In this case, race/deity selection. This would allow for special skills/abilities/bonuses appropriate to the combo. <P> <BR>  For example: We all know that the Scouts of Tunare are rogue woodelves or halfelves who worship Tunare. We also know that the the Black Hand are darkelf, rogue assassin-types. Two completely different ideas of what a rogue is. Why should their skills reflect it?  Scouts in this case get a limited track and a slightly faster speed over land, while their dark cousins get a harm touch-esque (in function, not damage) deathblow skill. Just think of how much that would change the way you look at race/deity selection, more importantly it would help distinguish you from others of your class more.  What about all those evil deity worshiping clerics too? Would be nice to see hard choices when picking a combo, and some benefit to those who go against the obvious picks.<P>Anywho, just a quick idea. I don't think you could really retro-fit something like that, but its a neat idea. Maybe there is a way to take that and turn into something that could function within EQ in a balanced and fair way.<P>Figburt Ficklefingers<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Rogues track all the time - it's called shadowing.  Find someone, follow them, use your knowledge of people's movements, the displacement they leave in their wake, and your area knowledge to aid you in following them.  Scouts do it.  Assassins do it.  Muggers do it.  <P>I seem to recall Absor mentioned that reducing the min range of throwing weapons was on the list, but I don't recall seeing it.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1 ) What about effects on the Ragebringer!??!!?<BR>Im tired of looking at the Particle effects through a microscope and tired of people asking me if i got my Epic weapon and could i equip it so they can see the Particle effects. You say Rogues shouldnt have Huge particle effects because they are sneaky. Thats fine with me. Can you at least make an Effect thats less visible when not attacking, but once you start attacking the effects become more visible? is that possible?<P>2 ) I think it would increase my chances of getting aggroed on if my sneak skill is constantly checked if im sneaking. This would be a nerf of the skill IMO. why would anyone want this? you get a message if your successful or not. Just refresh the skill if you get the message that your sneak failed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here are some items that I don't see on the list, quoted from Absor's previous posts.<P>1-"Bind Wounds: Skill cap pre-50 for Warriors and Rogues was 100. We are likely to be moving this to 175, with a max skill of 210. This would mean a 70% binding well before 60th level. We're also adjusting other classes caps higher as well, but in reality, only Monks, Warriors and Rogues used Bind Wounds with any frequency, and only Pure Melee and Priests will be able to bind to 70% of maximum hit points."<P>2-"Pick Pockets: Instead of a hard level cap at 45th for target NPCs, we're leaving it as it stands up to level 50 for the player. After a player is past 50th, it is (Player Level)-5 to set the level of an NPC whose pocket you can pick. All other pick pocket restrictions will remain in place, no magic or no-drop items can be purloined. So, to simplify this, at 60th you can steal from 55th or lower NPCs."<P>3-"Reduction of Min Range for throwing weapons. Not a removal, but a reduction, to around 3-5 feet. Should make them easier to use."<P>4-Instill Doubt still on the same timer as it is currently, but allowing that first backstab or special attack to land after ID goes off. This will happen. Still rewards those of you with good timing."<P>I would like to know what happened to those items...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am not going to argue the whole Evade thing yet again.  It is obvious that what the coders see, and what is seen in actual use are two different things.  Time will tell.  But, there is something more serious at stake.<P>"And perhaps sneak could break in the same fashion, since sneak currently does not break in these circumstances. Perhaps consistency here would be good."<P>Please consider the effects this change will have VERY closely.  The following will results:<P>#1: All good race low level rogues will be unable to buy food, water, weapons, and armor, as all merchants in their starting cities start off as dubious with a few exceptions.  Trust me, we don't need booze at that level.<P>#2: The entire epic quest is designed to have sneak used this way.  Change it, you end up thwarting all rogues currently involved in the quest as it can then NEVER be completed until redesigned.<P>#3: A few dungeons in the game (Sol A and Runnyeye to name two) have merchants located inside them that are only usable by rogues.  Once again, this change would cause loss of utilization at those places.<P>Please carefully consider each change you do for this class.  Logic is one thing, but when the game is designed a particuliar feature, bug or not, a lot more would need to be changed to compensate for it.  Let's not repeat the poison problem again by nerfing it because of an update 6 months later.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1.  A speed bonus to hide/sneak was already given with Kunark.  There is no need to be given further increases, unless you intend to eliminate the drawbacks to the skill all together.  They can easily get a speed increase with the help of a druid or ranger with Spirit of Wolf line spells.<P>2.  The existing backstab damage output is almost out of control.  To be able to double backstab for 500+ each hit is rediculous, especially when 10% or more of a wizard's(or any caster's) mana pool only does a little more than 500 damage.  Either the damage output of this class needs to be reduced in this regard, or the output of casters needs to be improved.<P>3.  The assassinate target as a proc should be changed to a discipline.  The same ability is given to monks in the form of the Ashenpalm disicpline, yet they have to wait 70 minutes for each use.  The rogues should have the same restrictions on use or have the Ashenpalm changed to a proc instead of discipline.  This arguement is based on balance of usefullness and effectiveness between the two classes abilities.<P>4.  There should be a group message of "&lt;So-and-so&gt; has pick pocketed &lt;target-item&gt;" or the monster should say "Doh! Who stole my &lt;target-item&gt;?!?!", just like regular loot messages.  The alternative would be for them to be unable to pick pocket any item that would sell to a vendor for more than 10pp.  The reason is because too many times I have seen rogues steal gems and spells, even non-magical items like the "Molten Cloak", and is simply unfair to everyone else.  It is tantamount to ninja-looting and should not be allowed to continue.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ok everyone, ive got an idea. wall climbing! think about it, mid to high levels, rogues gain the ability to climb sheer or almost sheer walls and cliffs. hopefully if that happens though, we get a skill increase in safe fall too *grin*. ive already seen that half elves can climb steeper inclines than humans, so the coding can probably be done.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>IMO, if you are going to NERF evade, then make it so it works more than 1/3 of the time. If it's going to be less effective, then make it actually WORK a majority of the time. It really pisses me off when a mob is going to town on me and my evade fails 3-4 times in a row. Im sure the healer isn't too pleased with me either. So, if you really want to "fix" evade, make it so it WORKS. Otherwise please leave it alone. (but i guess it's too late for that) <P> BTW, thanks for listening and removing the sneak issue from the list.

</FONT><HR>Here's my bit of common sense *grins evilly*<P>First, and repeating many others' opinion, do NOT touch ANYTHING from the rogue class that is already working properly, as-promised when we bought this game (not considering it took one year or close before we saw ANY poison game functionality), and AS INTENDED. <P>Second, Evade, you broke it? hmmm, so make it AT THE VERY LEAST the same as it was, not more useless, for Heaven's sake, have we not had enough nerfs, many of which came from "jealousy" of other classes complaining because they had CHOSEN to play a class less worthy or interesting as the rogue? I can think of monks or rangers that soon realized rogues where better able to solo than them, but the poor bastards never realized we were supposed to be a highly-defensive class, i.e., a high Agility class.<P>Third, imho, Absor you did get hit by the common sense of "i SEEEE the Light!" for removing the sneak nerfs probably coming from this above-mentioned "jealousy". I am starting to think some VI people really are taking THEIR prefered game class to hearth and become jealous of other classes... to even THINK it was EVER considered really gives me fits... LOL<P>Fourth, Tracking is a very good idea, and should fall in more closely with the dark side of rogues being poison-users, thus assassins... get it? Another person also mentioned in his bit of common sense that we are mostly, first and foremost, SCOUTS. We are better scouts than even rangers, the poor fools that like to hug trees for no reasons... LOL And a scout's first duties is stealth and awareness, thus tracking to see what lies near us. The one thing i would like to see as a limiting factor for this one, is that we have a smaller range/radius on this skill, otherwise, should be the same functionality as druids or rangers, specially if the latter gets spells in addition of his skill to complement his scouting abilities...<P>Fifth, Safe Fall should most definately be as class-defining to a rogue as Sneak&Hide skills, above backstab as one other person mentioned before. So yea, we should be BETTER at it than monks, or reduce the effectiveness of the monks FD then, since THAT (Feigh Death) is the monk's class-defining ability when it comes to "combat avoidance/defensive capabilities". We only have our legs and run to get away, along with Evade.<P>Well, this is mostly it, all other things mentioned and not discussed in my post means I feel good about them.<P>Toegue Shadowhounder<BR>36th rogue<BR>Solusek Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There are two things I haven't seen addressed, only one of which is particularily important.<P>First, the burning rapier graphic. While some want a particle effect or something else dramatic, I think all rogues would be happy with a simple graphics change. The rapier looks precisely like a fine steel rapier. This is a quest that takes a GREAT deal of time and effort for a rogue to complete, and is akin to a slightly lower level Soulfire as a mid-level quest weapon. I hope very much that you will consider some sort of graphics change, however minor, to distinguish it from a 5pp weapon that people let rot on the ground in many zones, and that this request will be carried over to the mid-level quest thread.<P>The second, and more important: Illusions. I can not concieve of why the illusions cast by our masks are not A. Click-cancellable, as all enchanter illusions are, and B. Able to last through zones and linkdeath.<P>Changing the illusions to click-cancellable is an obviously minor change that would simply bring the illusion in line with all the others in the game. As it is, only rogues truly suffer from this small inconvenience right now, since the mask is usable only by bards and rogues and bards get a cancel magic song shortly after the illusion becomes usable.<P>Myself, and many other bards and rogues using the mask that I know, have died while in an area like Neriak that they can frequent with the mask after a linkdeath. This is a unreasonable risk for the benefit of being able to use an extra bank/merchant or two. It is certainly not the intention of Verant to make one of the random factors that could cause death in a non-combat situation in an area where everything cons warmly (while illusion is up) is a glitchy ISP or a router burp. I believe enchanters also requested this, and would like to see it placed on our list as well.<P>Thank you for your time and attention.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>hmm sence mob interesting idea, also about evade which i missed in my last book lol, I clearily understand why you want to change "some say nerf" the way it works but on the same token every one who has said that evade doesnt work enough is also right i have found in general most warriors and sks can not effectively tuant mobs off rogues unless you  back up stop attacking and wait, lol why would a group want that might as well get and extra tank (not what i like to hear being a rogue but very much true sometimes)also besides the fact of rogues quickly dying in groups many times (unless you got a very uber equiped tank with you pretty bad when a rogue using a say a 8 dmg sbd needs a tank using say a wurmslayer)back to my point the other problem is for healers you heal a rogue who is up on that aggro list your about to get stomped on many times, when i group the first thing i tell healers (based on how well we aggro now, hate to see evade work even less so then it already does) do not heal me until the very last second or wait tell i tell you (wait for an evade to work for once) if they listen to me that saves healers from flying up the aggro list fast but at many times it also means i die. Evade i beleive is in some need to deffent revamping from two stand points one being the possible chanceto blow things off on a npc which will almost never happen as is but can possibly lol and also the fact that evade doesnt do it job well enough and often enough. <BR> my first suggestion would be take evade out of hide, yes i know you can make up the little handy macro for it but make it its own button for the skill and also make it work seeperately from hide skill wise.<BR> Also what ppl mentioned about about placing it say  6 spot down the list ect will not really work if you are not in a full group once again you run into the thing with npcs sence say you have a group of 4, 6 spots down is behind something that isnt possibily a player. <BR>  Improve succes rate aka as a sepperate skill allow it to develop to work better as used.<BR>  Maybe look into other classes, improve the tuant skill inorder to allow it to more effectively do the job for that which it was created.<BR>  But another important thing to look at is make sure that vbs still places up on aggro list fast because that comes in handy saving the caster who just healed you.<P>Also the reason behind some of the thrown weps/poisons (aka dust cloud/smoke cloud)i was talking about where to help work arround the shortfall of evade and rogue aggroing and also to give use skill that will benifet a group more in general (which poison would do if the average rogue could afford to do)<P>enough of the evade chapter in my latest message board novel<P>The idea of the sence mobs is cool basically a very short range treacking would be a nice skill to have for dungeons, not nessarily let it tell you the name  a set mob but something along the lines of you sence "  " (general lvl in words sorta like that of the way con works)threat approaching/standing (behind, to the left or right or infront ) of you. This skill is justifiable also in the roleplay sence a rogue who follows the ways of cunning and sealth (as opposed to some big ogre warrior eating, smashing, chasing any thing coming into its path)that they would have developed refined sences in order to survive.<P>oh yeah, Thank You for not changing sneak, and i am sure all the monks and bards whp saw that little thing on sneak also thank you.<P>Inda Shadebringer (tribunal)<P>"More throwing weps for all,specially for those ogres where running out of gnomes"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The rogues should have it is flying colors what they are doing but the rest of the group should see it like every other attack.  <BR>Story time:  The other night myself and some of my rogueish brothers were in Cazic-Thule camping (what else) Ravenscale.  After watching us fear engulfing darkness, ignite, weaken, ect. our mobs a bard came up and said that she did no know that rogues could cast spells and what kind of spells can we cast.  AT the end of a LOOONG discustion, thanks to instill dougt, weapon procs, and illusion masks, we had everyone in the zone thinking that rogues could cast a few spells of ANY type.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  This was about 30 people including a lv 60 cleric that really should have known better. <P>The Point to this story is that we are rogues, sneaky dishonest indeviduatls.  People do not know much about us and we LIKE it that way.  If people started to know much about us we would stop being that shadowy spooky class that we are.

</FONT><HR>I like some of the ideas posted.  <P>-More items locked or to be unlocked.  I.E. Doors, boxes, and traps.<P>-Rogues should have more shady or shadowy garb.  Or perhaps if color is wanted, for those of us cavalier types, another selection of garb.  Perfect tools for the job, I say.<P>-Sense Traps needs to be more useful.  Perhaps it could be used to sense false walls or pitfalls.  Or more traps could be added to the game.  That certainly would make rogues indispensible.<P>-Damage Shields versus range weapons needs to be fixed also.  Isn't a damage shield supposed to keep an enemy at bay or face damage.  The enemy thus must fall back and fight at range, but currently they still get damaged without being near the critter.  Fixing this might entice a whole new market for range weapons and those who use them.<P>-Someone posted an idea on Set Traps.  I like this idea...  Has potential...  Just watch out for wandering Mobs when setting your minefield or you might get caught in it yourself.  It's a double edge sword.  Just my two coppers.<P>-On the idea of mobs dropping locked boxes...  Good idea, it would create a rogue's (or bard's) market as locksmiths.  The post sounds a shade creepy and similar to Gemstone III.  I'm sure the Everquest guru's can figure a way to tinker with this idea.  Personally I like the idea.  I used to be a Gemstone III rogue until I got zombified by Everquest.<P>-Poisons...  Please, please make em stack.  And allow for coating ranged weapons.

</FONT><HR>As one who likes to play rouges I feel that there is a lot that can be done to better the class. First off pick pocket. This is an important skill of a rouge and it's has been all but disabled! First thing about pick pocket is that you sould be able to sneak/hide and pick pockets unless you fail then you would also fail your sneak/hide role. Futher more a rouge should be allowed to pick anyones pockets, however if he fails, he recieves a PK Flag which allows others to kill him. Dying removes the flag or going to a temple and giving a donation to resolve Sins... Futher more rouges should be giving the ability to loot dead monsters fasters than the normal char, as well as being able to make a role to loot corpses of PC's, again aplying the PK flag if he fails (ie. is seen). Just my rouging two cents worth. USE MORE FLAGS! I hate it that MUD have always down play rouges! They are not nessicerely a social class!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ITEM: Stun with Backstab.<P>DESCRIPTION: A sort of backstab, but with blunt weapons. So if the rogue is behind the opponent and uses his backstab while wielding a one-handed blunt weapon there would be a chance to stun the target. Such a backstab attempt might also do normal(not backstab) damage, to compensate for the stun chance.<BR>_______________________<P>Tell me what the heck the point of this would be? The stun would have to be long enough for Backstab to cycle around at least once, or its absolutely stupid. Also, you would have to let the rogue know that he had stunned the opponent or it would be pointless.<P>Why not CLIMB WALLS for gods sake? This has always been a staple rogue talent, the catburgler esque skill would be SO usefull in SO many places. <P><BR>How about the ability to pick pocket PC's if you wanted. Pickpocketing isn't an attack and shouldn't be treated as such at ALL. And if the rogue is smart and crafty he could do it well and get away with it. I mean, obviously any rogue that did that too much would be detected and his reputation would spread that he is a "thief" and he would be ostrasized from groups and raids even maybe his guild.. but that would spawn a genre of THIEVING to the game that would make it FUN. I think that being able to pocket maybe only up to 3p from any PC every day would be funny and great way to roleplay. A caught thief could either deny, sheepishly give it back (haha yah right), or not pick people. <BR>Man.. even my friend next to me at the D&D table has stolen from my character, cause I come back to the character sheet and be light a little bit of dough, the GM having marked it off because the rogue made a skill roll while I wasn't looking. ARRR. I would simply laugh and threaten him with my mighty spells if he should do that again. I think that's FUN.<BR>Rogues aren't just damage doers, though that's our ONLY real role in Norrath. We should be able to be vile if we so choose. Putting a limit on how much money you could pick from a PC per 12hour period or something, like 3p would make it so that a rogue can't just stand by you and clean you out, but he can have a little fun and make a little money, roleplay, perhaps:<BR>"Hmmm, what have we here? a lost coin! Say hello to my pouch, little coin. *grin*" <P>It would also improve the rogue class to add an ability to remove agro completly with evade in a certain percentage of the time, perhaps according to level? I mean is it not feasable that say you could run up behind a mob, pick its pockets.. it turns on you, you riposte a strike from it, and evade..  if you found some really good shelter in the shadows that a mob might just not be able to see you at all and wander away? I mean.. think about this.. casters could gate. SK's can Feign Death, clerics, shamans, druids and paladins can root, warriors can take a harsh beating while running to the zone.. rogues just get dead. There should be a percentage that you completely evade from combat, wherein the mob isn't agro on you at all cause he can't see you!!<P>I dunno.. just a few thoughts. I of course want to see the sneak movement rate improved, AND the announcement of backstab damage in the same vein as warrior Criticals. <P>Thanks! that's my thoughts.<P>Shadowhands<BR>46 Tier'Dal (Born n' True) ROGUE<BR>Solusek Ro<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>I want to touch upon one thing real fast before i put in 2 more cents in the pot..<P>     Rogues are practically useless outside of a group the option to Solo is NOT there.. and why is that? well you took thier biggest weapon away from them... Backstab in Solo encounters.. i HAVE to run from MOSTLY everything that is blue con to me.. this is like taking 80% mana and the pet away from a necro NOT in a group.. not fair.. the speed at which a Mob turns is too fast and sorry i Have NEVER had a "Circle Straf" work on NON-caster mobs.. just doesn't work sorry...the only reason i'm bringing this up is because the unsaid word this board is about "BALANCE"....<P>*** ok i'll calm down now ***<BR> <BR> I personally feel these all could be answered LOGICALLY .. think of what a Rogue is.. what they do? and what THEY need to do it!! <P><BR>*ARMOR COLOR - Sure sounds nice but can this wait till AFTER there is a good balance?<P>*SENSE TRAPS - It needs to be more accurate and useful.. there are already not enough traps it the game to warrent this a useful skill.. sorry that is the way i feel<P>*TRACKING - I agree with this.. i think Rogue should get a form of tracking.  Not like what a ranger has that is their specialty.  I think a rogue should get a Single screen (IE no scroll bar) No Mob Con's . and only the CLOSEST mobs to them.. <BR>     Ok to limit to City only is pretty much just as useless as Disarm traps or disarm it's self. and what next Ranger Track limited to Forest only? ROFL yeah bet they would like that...<P>*SPEED INCREASE WHILE HIDE AND SNEAKING SNEAK <BR>i REALLY feel this should start ALOT sooner than levle 50 or 41 like you brought up.. i mean you have had the skill since what level 4? and no speed increase for HOW LONG???? OMG you would think maybe if nothing else you could make a separate skill that would ALLOW speed increases for it.. (i know more wasted Skill names to something that should be a given)<P>*SKILL INCREASES POISONING IN FULL SCREEN MODE <BR>No idea don't like full screen mode.. sorry i'm no help here<P>*STACKABLE POISONS <BR>I think this is a must poisons take up WAY too much room as is already.. i ALSO feel you should be able to combine your poison vial and your suspension in advance to save a little more room on the go<BR>(IE, "A Sealed Vial of Etheral Suspention")<BR>probably more wasted typing on that tho.. hehe<P>*SNEAKING IN WATER <BR>i PERSONALLY feel this should be HIGHLY acceptable i mean that is VERY Rogue like.. silence in water is same as what a rogue would need on land.. Stealth is Stealth and to get from point A to point B.. but to base the speed of the sneak should be directly related to your swimming skill NOT that CRAWL it is now in the water...<P>*INCREASED SAFEFALL <BR>i Personally LOVE safefall but if you didn't increase it i could live with that too...<P>*HIDE/SNEAK OVERWRITING INVISIBILITY <BR>i think Invis even BARD invis could not TOUCH you while hiden and sneaking.. but i also feel that the bard songs Period shouldn't vis you i mean if my Shaman friend SoW's me while i'm invis with his spell of invis i don't get vis'ed then... hmm what was that "consistancy" needs a little touching up there.. <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>*ILLUSION MASKS <BR>i personally feel these are a total disrespect to rogues.. rogues are masters of many things and you just utterly DESTROYED the art of disguise with these being the ONLY way to disguise ourselves. Bah, i'm hurt with this insult....<P>*HASTE FOR MISSILE WEAPONS <BR>Sure why not? haste is haste right? umm YEAH.. hehe<P>*SNEAK AND HIDE FUNCTIONALITY <BR>i'll leave this alone since you said you would.. hehe<P>*REPORT BACKSTAB MESSAGES TO THE GROUP <BR>NO NO NO NO NO!!!!!!!.. last thing i want to hear is WAHHHHH WAHHHHH WAHHHHH that's not fair.. Rogues are shafted enough as it is.. Play one yourself till level 50 then say it is Fair to be a rogue compared to others...NO twinking..<BR>don't put salt in an open wound ya know. you already have people fretting over backstab damage but what they don't realize it gets us killed sometimes too, and it isn't ALWAYS 1k dmg either.. i have talked to MANY level 60's and one of them told me his best was 1050dmg with a double backstab and the Duelist discipline.. <P>*LOCKED CHESTS <BR>PLEASE do.. And one more thing.. Limit yourselves to the amount of MAGICAL locks .. i mean Geez look at tower of frozen shadows... or the ONE locked door in HH Keep.. the Key only thing is a BIT too much of a Nerf for rogues as it is!!<P>*DAMAGE SHIELDS AND MISSILES <BR>No idea.. i use a bow cause the missle weapons suck with range no reason for me to change over to the thrown ones now.<P>*EVADE <BR>Nerf it and Have a massive reduction of rogues.. it might not work well anyways but when it is all you have, you have to rely on it. Honestly i feel you should make it work better not MESS it up...<P>*HIDE/SNEAK ACROSS ZONE BORDERS <BR>what was that you were looking for .."consistancy"....  yes you should<P>*SET TRAPS <BR>hmm not sure how to feel about that.. it would be fun to mess with but nothing worth while i feel .. unless your on a PVP server.<P>*THROWING WEAPONS <BR>Don't use them cause thier range sucks.. enough said....<BR>*APPLY POISON ANIMATION. <BR>sure why not... but LOW on the priority scale please<P>*SOULBOUND LOCKPICKS <BR>Well sounds nice but not enough locks for them to be a high priority sorry but that is the way i feel.... Pick locks is practically a skill not to practice unless you can't get in a group (cause god knows you can't solo after 30 unless your an uber twink)<P>*POISON ON THROWN WEAPONS <BR>Thrown AND archery too.. i mean what is the differnce????? but then again this is a sure thing to get you killed on the hate scale of a mob .. if you pulled it and did poison dmg to it <BR>Call the healer cause you probably won't be able to get it off you.<BR>*STUN WITH BACKSTAB <BR>Blah.. don't like it.. might as well just give the rogue bash.. ROFL... Now on the other hand if you made it STUN and then SLOW the mob for a while then sure.. i mean think a good head shot SHOULD slow about anything.....<P>Dahlor<BR>41st Heist<BR>Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I read this and thought I might add to it.<P>&gt;&gt;Now for the one I've been REALLY wanting to post on. I'm going to expand on inda's idea of the sleeping powder, sand, etc. A potter makes a small, hollow ball (new sketch/recipe needed), the rogue put the ball and powder components in Mortar & Pestle. When combined, a ball of "such and such" is produced (stackable item hopefully). The ball is put in ranged slot. When it hits mob the spell takes effect. I'm not sure how the mechanics of the game works, and I don't know if the spell "going off" on contact is possible. Of course, it could be turned into a new skill if you wished. Maybe for rogues and monks...maybe bards too. Same basic idea, and the rogues could sell the "dust balls" to the other classes that can use it.&lt;&lt;<P>It would be great if you would combine this with the enchanters thicken mana line.  Thicken mana could be used as one of the components that is used to create this.  That would help create the need for character interaction outside of melle.  A missle item with spell effect is really missing from the game.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I believe the reason for not being able to cancel the illusions is because the illusion is casted by the mask more than by us (we click it, while the mask casts and turns us into dark elves,iksars,etc) and if you have ever noticed as a caster, some buffs can be canceled if you casted it but if casted on another, they can't cancel it. An example of one of these spells would be invis, I could as my mage cast invis on myself and turn it off at will, while as some other char, when I have it casted on me, I would have to attack or cast to get it to wear off.<BR>So, in other words, its not like they were trying to punish us or something by not letting us undo an illusion while enchanters can, just how the game engine works.<P>Tirren<BR>19 rogue<BR>Cazic-Thule<P>P.S.

</FONT><HR>That is total Bull, if Sneak goes down while we talk to merchants, then how are we supposed to interact? nearly ALL merchants hate us more than any other class! what do they expect us to do? that's bull<BR>As for evade, it isn't NEARLY 100% effective, even when it does work, you go near him, your back up to #1 on his list, leave evade alone! You don't seem to mind feign death, and personally, I'd take feign death over evade any day.<BR>It sounds to me like Verant has decided to Nerf us hardcore ( /Rude ) <BR>if we can't pickpocket anything unless it's 5 levels lower, what the hell is the point? that defeats the purpose of it!!!!! that means our skill cap is F'in pointless! who in their right mind fights something 5 levels lower? We raise our skill by fighting blues and up! but that means by raising our skill we would never succesfully pickpocket the MOB, Verant is not being fair, leave our skills the way they are, don't change anything, we could be better, but instead they're making us A LOT worse, what is up with this?
