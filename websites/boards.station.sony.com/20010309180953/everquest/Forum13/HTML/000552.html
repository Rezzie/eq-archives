</FONT><HR>I understand dedication to a class, & trying to get issues addressed.  Playing this game soooo long to get just to 50, then to 60, it is a big commitment.  And certianly you are going to develop some opinions on play style and the game over all.  <P>But be careful about chosing this guy to speak on the issues.  He is way out of control.  I really think his major interest is just to see how many people he can insult and belittle.  He shows little regard for others opinions and feelings.  In this attempt he is a very poor choice of advocates.  This is a negotiation, give and take, if you get someone like this guy, its all take and all he gives back is grief.  <P>I truly think you could find a better representative.  Eventually this guy is going to paint himself into a corner he won't be able to get out of.<P>as Praying-Mantis has pointed out, its a game, it should be about fun.  Even if their are some problems with a class, it should still be fun.  State the concerns then go back and enjoy.  If things were really horrible, I think we'd hear a lot more about the problems.  I don't hear my friends playing high level monks telling me they're so helpless.  I see them instead kickin ass right alongside me and enjoying the challenges of the high end game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Chickenlegs has made many valid points.  The fact that they are steeped in sarcasm and cynicism is not altogether without reason.  <P>Many longstanding monks have heard the song and dance about class balance for years now.  They clung to their class because of loyalty and hope that it would return to the unique class it was before.  I think most are beginning to realize, or have already realized, that monks are basically warriors who aren't allowed to wear good armor.<P>I think that there are people who would say you make a stronger point by avoiding hyperbole and sarcasm, but both those tools are also sometimes very useful and illustrative.<P>The monk class was never an Uber class.  The pre-kunark monk class was somewhat of an enigma to most players.  Only those that demonstrated the fortitude to stick through the first 25 or so levels of monk-hell learned that monks were a unique and very special class.  They weren't so much better than any other class as unique.  The gaming experience for a monk player was very different than that of other classes.<P>Kunark obliterated that.  The differences that used to define a monk were either eliminated or magnified to the point of becoming punitive.<P>1.  What used to be a lack of options in equipment became a deficiency in equipment quality.  Monks used to have to work harder to get the equipment they needed, but once they had it, they were happy because it was good...on par with that available to others.  Now monks just have to put up with either never having the equipment that is more readily available to their tanking bretheren, or watching it go to someone's twink because it's so rare, and tradeable.<P>2.  What became a different style of fighing that focused on dishing out damage rather than absorbing it, became an obsolete sub-standard form of tanking.  Monks used to be balanced, but now warriors are the consummate tank, dealing the most damage because they are the only ones who can stay in the fight for any length of time.<P>3.  Our class-defining skill, Feign Death, is non-essential to groups now.  It doesn't perform the function that it was originally used for, because of mob memory and hate list adjustments.  What used to make a monk a desireable, and sometimes necessary, part of a group is no longer there.  <P>Now that the word is out that warriors do nearly the same damage as monks, have more hitpoints, and have higher armor class, as well as being able to interrupt casters more readily, why on earth would anyone want a monk?<P>The answer used to be "Feign Death".  Is it the answer anymore?  NO!<P>The answer now is, "Who needs a friggin monk.../ooc group looking for a warrior."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well I guess I was being a bit tounge in cheek when I said that.  I don't per'se really get involved deeply in Monk issues.  I do care about them.  There are several good team mates of mine in guild that are monks, and quite talented at pulling very dangerous zones like Kael Arena and Throne Rooms.  I also have quite a few friends out of guild that are monks, my best friend has a monk as his main.  So in as much as I care about my friends, I care about the monk class.  Its wierd how my friends never tell me how worthless they are.  We talk alot, but that never seems to come up... Hmmm.  I guess maybe they're embarrased?  Dunno.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>AS an old school monk (thats from day one), most folks who began playing the monk class were hard and stubborn players that put up with all the negatives of the class to get to what they thought would be a unique and needed class for groups. For those that do not know what the negatves were in the beginning let me list them here:.<BR>     1. -12% xp penality for monks<BR>     2. until kunark humans were the only race.<BR>     3. 14 lbs weight penality. <BR>     4. AC modifier for exceeding weight penality<BR>     5. eating deaths on pulls<BR>     6. pre kunark tradeing high skills for low Hp<BR>     7. Pulling in bad places.<P>After Kunark, and the iskar monk came about, many old school monks debated complained, moaned  , whatever description you want to use for six months, and basically it fell on deaf ears. The Dojo closed down (at that time the main monk site), many in the monk community felt disspirited and wondered where they fit in the new world. Like our nature in the beginning we are stubborn, many dont post anymore because they don't see any reason to. The truely funny aspect to all of this is, what is being said today was said 8 months ago. Many of us are too stubborn to move on, waiting that one final time to see if the monk class will have it's day in court. chuckle the judge will be on vacation for that one.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
