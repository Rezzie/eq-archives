We are the majority of your subscribers, and we expect to be listened to. If you ignore us, you do so at your peril.

</FONT><HR>&lt;&lt;Seelay: did you go into those zones with an already formed group?<P>Why doesn't Velious have a dungeon where I can log on alone at the zone and shout for a group as in Karnors. The only groups going there are already formed elsewhere as far as I can tell. Some times I like to log and play for 2 hours. A quarter of that might be finding a group, another quarter travel, then half my time is eaten up.<P>[edit for length]<P>Many people mean by lack of content the lack of dugneon/outdoor zones where you can log on, shout for a group, get one pretty quickly and start fighting. It's easy to do from 1 to 50~. It gets a lot harder after that and Velious did nothing to help.&gt;&gt;<P>I can't answer the question about why Velious doesn't have a dungeon suitable for pick-up groups, which would suit your particular playstyle, but with regard to your other question, no, those weren't pick-up groups I was in (in Chardok, Velketor's, Kael, etc).  I've played this game since May of 1999, I have a lot of friends I've made during that time and in 59 levels.  When it's time to go experience, I just send tells and form the group to go among my friends.  And no, I'm not a member of FoH or any of the other "uber-guilds" people love to rant on.<P>Your 55-60 game experience is left largely up to you, I think.  The time you have (or are willing) to spend, what friends you have made, what your reputation is, will all play a role.  The answer to the pseudo-problem identified in the original posting isn't "dumbing down" uber encounters, in my view.  It MIGHT be adding new content for levels 55-60 who aren't in those "uber guilds" -- but if I were Verant I'd be darned reluctant to do that when there are GOOD zones for experiencing (and raiding in smaller numbers) at those levels which are going begging... or dismissed as "raid zones" because of their perceived difficulty.<P>If Verant added 16 dungeons and called them all LGuk2, OS4, maybe that would satisfy some of the complaints in this thread?  Personally, I'm finding plenty to do to keep me challenged and happy as I continue to experience toward level 60.  And before you call me a VAK, I've done two lengthy posts in the last week infuriated at Verant and some of their recent actions.  I just think this thread is off the mark.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am going to assume that Kindergarten comment was aimed at me  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">. Cute. Got me there...<P>&lt;&lt;Verant NEVER can and NEVER will tune the game to your demographic. To do so would be virtual suicide for the game company.&gt;&gt;<P>And you know this how? Actually, if there was a way to be more then 180 degrees out, this statement would qualify. <P>Since you are so fond of citing "business practice", I can add some real life experience (About 25 years worth) and knowledge. Any corporation that tunes itself to the elite few, will loose market share. Basic rule of thumb with any Marketing campaign, or any product is to seek out the largest possible customer base. <P>Second, you cited UO as an example in a later post.  It is an example of your logic failure. UO tuned the game to the elite few, or Ubers. It was not raids, but PK that was the issue. The game began to revolve around these elite few (PK guilds, and Anti PK guilds). <P>They too were hard and fast. They too did not listen to the customer base. They too held market share due to lack of competition. That logic was defended by the same pseudo intellectual business tycoons. That logic failed also. Eventually, Census dropped, the team was tossed, and they began to cater to the "rest" of the players. <P>Was too late, however. When EQ hit the streets with the promise of a better game, they not only lost market share, they were crushed. They still survived only because the original team was replaced and they began their damage control early, but have never recovered. Had they maintained your  logic, they would be even smaller then they are. <P>Your logic is flawed in so many ways that I could spend a day posting about it. These arguments have all been had, the insults have all flown, and the results where then, what they will be now. I would have kept my mouth shut on this had it not been for your arrogant, and condescending attitude. It is laughable.<P>The only way this game continues to survive is due to the fact that there is no real competition. If there was equal competition, and people were not satisfied with the product, they would simply move. Eliminate that option, and the desire for the product maintains the customer base, however dissatisfied that base maybe. <P>&lt;&lt;Tuning encounters to lame duck groups ends up with the encounters becoming trivialized and then guess what? Yep, use that 'Logic and Critical Thinking' class you just took, they have to upgrade the mobs AGAIN.&gt;&gt;<P>If anything, it should be about allowing the two game styles to coexist so that the company can truly reach, and hold the market share. I do not believe however, that there is enough clear logic at this time to accomplish that task. <P>The result is that they have not only failed in this, but have enacted the worst of all scenarios. They have begun to tune the game to the top 5 percentile. Your carrot at the nose of the donkey analogy is simplistic and does not apply. <P>You are correct in your assumption that "tuning to the lame ducker" would create trivialized encounters, but where your logic fails is in its self centered scope. Trivial for you only, fun for the rest of us. <P>The result would not be to retune the mobs, but to let people enjoy the game, and winning. It would result in your select group running rampant for a short time, then getting bored and leaving for the newer, more challenging games. <P>They are going to loose customers to the next generation of games anyway. Better to prepare to loose the fickled few who will leave for more challange anyway, then the main customer base. <P>The fact is, no matter how central you believe you are to the game, you are and abomination. In the worst case of loosing the uber guilds it would not only be ok, but actually benificial to the game -just as it was with UO. <P>The game design does not support them. The game is based on the 6 man group, anything else is the result of the fact that the "team", shares your mentality. That will be their undoing. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Quality of the loot items is not an issue.<P>I don't want Yelinak's loot to drop off moss snakes.<P>I don't want it to drop off Yelinak, either.<P>The reward for a difficult encounter should be the satisfaction of completing the mission, and maybe some useless but distinctive trinket you can show off when someone doubts you actually did it.<P>The munchkins like to claim that they're playing at a higher difficulty level -- but if that were so, then why do they receive items of ever-increasing power?  A higher level of difficulty would call for less powerful gear, not more powerful.<P>To use a comparison frequently made in tabletop gaming, I'm old enough to remember pinball machines that kept score in tens of thousands of points.  Scoring 100,000 meant "rolling over" the score meter from 99,999 to 0.  Nowadays, though, you get half a million points for launching the ball.<P>Did pinball, the game, change?  No, they just added more zeroes.  And that's what is happening at the high end in EQ.  Munchkin D&D.  <P>Risk versus reward?  Not a factor, because there is no risk.  A failed raid means you lose what meager EP your Cleric's epic noodle didn't restore.  Implicit in the concept of risk is the concept of loss; if there is nothing to lose, there is nothing at risk.<P>FoH's mouthpieces argue that the carrot has to be waived at the mule's nose, not the midsection.  That begs the question of whether or not there should be a carrot at all.  For the true elite, the journey is the destination -- a statement which absolutely excludes FoH and its competitors.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Eudin, if FoH played on the same server as you, and they actually cared about Lodizal because he had better drops, or they needed an extra shield or two, you would not get it.  I play in a predominantly Asian guild, when patches are over, we most the time get first choice because we can mobilize quick at that time.  If stuff drops off an easy encounter that can in any way be compared to stuff off Kelorak, nagafen, vox, CT, Inny, guess what?  The *casual gamers* aren't gonna see it until my guild's farmed it^^.  Is that being a dick?  No, it's us playing at our normal time we always do.  It's the fact that good stuff is dropping off MoBs that make us not want to waste our time in VP.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
