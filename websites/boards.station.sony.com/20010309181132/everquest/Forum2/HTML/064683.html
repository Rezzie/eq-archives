</FONT><HR>Verant.. with this batch of cleric nerfs, you finally went too far. You didnt just spoil the fun for a class, you spoiled it for all the classes.  Clerics are not gonna play the game as is and we all know what will happen without clerics. If you dont undo all of what you did with that hate list crap, I will cancel my accounts and move over to Anarchy Online which is set for release very soon.<P>I played 3 classes to 50 b4 I found the cleric class to be all that I loved, but now I can't play the game and have fun.  I'm tired of 1 hour prep for raid, possibly 1 hour acutally doing the raid, and 3 hours CR without even completing the raid objective b/c the healers all got killed.<P>This post is for Verant, and not for player feedback, all player feedback will be ignored, b/c it will consist of quit, less lag for everyone cliche stuff.<P><BR>3/31/00 is your date Verant.. I will be cancelling my 4 accounts with you if its not changed and I will not come back.  I will never buy a Verant product in the future either, no EQ2, No SWO, and No sovereign crap.  I will get all my friends in game to move also to another game, quite possibly the majority of the guild (a large one at that), of whome, most own 2 or 3 accounts and feel very much the same way as me.<P>Sony/Verant is in OUR world now!  I'm the boss, and I'm gonna nerf your wallets if you dont get in shape!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

You might not understand/accept/care about their frustration as you don't play that class, but you know for SURE you don't want them to leave. And the higher level you are, the better friends these are as you spend so much time with them.<P>If my friends quit bcs of a nerf then I want this nerf fixed, no matter whether something was "in balance" for Verant or not.<P>Valmdar, if you quit your accounts at the end of march: VERY BRAVE, this might help Verant to care more about their customers for the good of the game.

</FONT><HR>Nice to see some people that understand.  Most people replying dont seem to understand b/c they are probably newer players.  Day 1 of EQ was a very different game then today, classes used different strategies back then b/c they had some nice spells.  But over time, classes got nerfed, spawns got longer, drops got rarer, and mobs got stronger.<P>Often times, my guild has to make 2 groups to go thru a dungeon, so there is always 1 group that doesn't get exp an a kill... designed like that on purpose to prevent leveling.  Its annoying hehe.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Valmdar - ROFLMAO @ Val -<BR>I do hope the "sitting hate" bug is fixed.<P>I really doubt the great hate caused by the high level heals is going to change.  (2 hate for 3 heal points on a 2500hp heal is still gonna hurt...a LOT)...I wonder if they really did put in the max heal hate thing I heard mentioned.  It did not sound fair to me.  I nuke for 1600 damage and get 1600 hate, cleric heals for 2500 damage and only gets 800 hate?<P>Just a thought:  You might want to start over with a simple post that has:<BR> - What changed that you dislike.<BR> - What *game balance preserving* change you believe is needed.<P>That might actually do some good, this drivel surely did not.  All you said was: "I went on a raid and I died, wraaaa!" This is not helpful.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Right on Dominate you tell him. The only reason the clerics are mad is because they arent the "godlike" characters they once were. As far as the old ones leaving, bye, dont let the door hit you on the way out. We are sick of you lording over the game as it is.

</FONT><HR>I only have one account, myself. But on that account I have four 50+ chars (ranging to 57), a 39, a 30, and a 32. I leave the eighth slot free to help friends or to do temporary muling or whatever, a utility slot.<P>One of the chars is a cleric. I have seen the healing agro, from the perspective of the cleric and from the perspective of the one being healed and protecting the cleric. They obviously did overdo the healing agro, but they seem to have recognized this and are correcting it. I don't expect (or even want) the cleric class to be as risk-free as it once was; some challenge is fun.<P>But whenever there's such a bad implementation of a change, I have no problems going off and playing another char for a while. Heck, that's why I have so many that are as high in level as they are. And no powerleveling here; I don't want to be powerleveled. Learning classes properly and initimately requires that you play them the hard way, by fighting and grouping, not by having a druid hang around wasting his time healing you and casting damage shields.<P>And ya know, the game is STILL fun to me! I guess it's still fun because, for me, the fun is all in the journey, not the destination. Being 60th won't really be fun; I see that pretty clearly already. The journey TO 60 will be fun, with each char I choose to do that with. Ultimately, it'd be neat to have all seven of my chars 50+; that's one of my goals, actually, and I'm not really that far from it now. But it's the people I'm with, and the experiences we share, that's the fun for me, not the ubermobs or hitting level X or getting uberitem Y or acquiring zillions of plat to buy uberitem Z, or anything like that.<P>If you forget everything else except that the real pleasure is in the journey and not in the destination, then EQ has an immensely long 'fun span'. For those who are all tied up on one thing (killing ubermobs, achieving items, amassing wealth), well, yeah, your time of enjoyment will probably be far less in duration than my own. And that's okay. If it's ever not fun for me, I'm outta here too.<P>But I haven't run out of cool people to meet and hang with, and it doesn't really look like I will, so, for now at least, I'm still having a good time.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I really liked Nazgaroth's post.  I think that to some degree Verant IS realizing that Velious is just not worth it.  They made it too hard and too exclusionary for many caster classes.  As an enchanter I follow Naz's lead; I do not GO to Velious at all, except to buy velium.  I fight in Kunark where I am still useful and not a buff-ho.<P>I think that the best thing to do is just find the niches you like and have fun in.  If Velious is the only place you feel you can have fun in, but also feel that it is too hard (or uber-mobs), then you will have to either stop going there and find alternatives or quit.  This WILL send a message to Verant, but it will take time.<P>My hope is that more and more people will just give up on Velious to show Verant that their slap-dash, rush-job expansion is a poor effort and needs to be re-tooled.  Badly.<P>Just my 2 cp.<P>Akariel 53 chanter</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1: This is not the place for communication if you do not want player feedback.<P>2: From Verants point of view, they have already won. They have kept people paying monthly fees for two full years. They are a sucess no matter what. If everybody left today that wouldn't change, the story would just end a little sooner.<P>3: Many people are happy with the game, and yes this does apply largly to low level people. However, for every high level person that quits, there are two newbs leveling up to take their place. In fact, Verant needs you to quit and take some lewt and plat out of the game. There needs to be more room at the top. Letting people just beat the game and move on would be a better way to get it, but that would require hurting the prized creation. EQ is the masterpiece, and it would be hard for them to lower themselves to flawing it for mere players..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>His post should have gone a Little something Like this. Verant this is a letter I am sending to Sony on line with a carbon copy to Lucas Arts and verant incorperated.  I am tired of the way we are being treated by the verant interactive customer service and Dev teams. they have taken what used to be a fun product and changed it to the point that it is no longer worth my time.  The treat the 300,000 active subscribers as if they are beta testers for their little project and give us absolutely no respect.  As it appeares  Star Wars Galaxies is going to be a verant run product and verant has show no customer support or concern for customer sastifaction on a concern for ROI I can not forsee the need to purchase anything from them in the future.  And as verant a division of sony on line which is a division of sony inc shows no customer support other I have to believe that Sony will be sony following this trend and will have to find other products the full fill the role that a sony product would.<P>That would get the attention of sony and verant a lot better as posting on the boards will get you no where.  Hit them in the parent and future income areas and Sony inc will start takeing notice.  And you get enough of your friends who have said they will join you and bingo you have Sony on line involved and looing into what verant is doing to make so many people upset.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well stated, Pryzmos.  <P>My guild's clerics in the high level range seem quite happy to continue, though we all enjoy levelling alts as well.  VI seems to have realized, rightly, that they overdid the hate list aggro for heals.  They admit the mistake and are making the changes.  Items being nerfed should never have been in the game anyway, and VI seems to be considering changes to the ultra high end game to compensate for the nerfs.<P>Other than the healing aggro (which also affects druids and shamans) clerics haven't had it that bad.  They are still required for high end encounters and still desired for day to day grinding.  <P>Lastly, let the uber folks leave.  I won't miss them now, and it will leave more room for me and mine to hunt at the top.  Eventually, I'll join them in leaving the game, and that will be fine, too.  That's the way it works.<P>-TTm</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
