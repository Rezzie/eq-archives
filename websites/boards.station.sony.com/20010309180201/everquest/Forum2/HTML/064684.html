&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Ok today I logged on asked a GM if my name violated the new naming policy. The name I go by is Gambit. Now a fictional comic book hero uses the word gambit as his name. However gambit has been a word in the English language for a long long long time. So I open up Merriam-Webster Dictionary and look up the word gambit: "1) a chess opening move in which a player risks one or more minor pieces to gain an advantage in position 2) a calculated move." No where does it say anything about a copywrited X-men name. So I bring this potential problem up to a GM. The GM tells me sorry it violates the policy and changes it immediately. I ask for the chance to discuss this first, but I get "email verant" response and the GM promptly changes my name. I have been playing EQ since beta phase 3. I have gone by the name gambit and nothing else. I have played a barbarian shaman and nothing else. I have no alts about level 2. I logged on hour 2 EQ went commerical so I could make sure I got that name. In that time, never has anyone ever complained or said my name was a violation. This includes many many interactions with GMs. NOW after I approached them, they said it violates the name policy. All I asked was for the chance to present my arguements but Verant would not give me that even though I have been a long time customer and good player reputation. Unforunately they are seriously pressing the issue to the point of extremes. Thus it is unforunate that I must push back. Under thier rules many of thier own creations violate this policy. Take rogue for example. It is much like the word gambit. Rogue is also a copywrited X-men character. You can say you use it as a title but you make no clarification if this title refers to the english word or the copywrited X-men character. Would the name Xmix the Bill Clinton be acceptable? No it would not according to your rules. Therefore YOU HAVE TO REMOVE ROGUE from the game if you enforce these rules. Next example is Frogluk Jin Wizard. This is the name of a mob in Everquest. Unforunately using the name wizard is a violation of the naming policy. Puting an adjective in front of it does not fix the problem. Because Evil Bill Clinton or Jin Bill Clinton would not fly under your policy either. Good Gandalf would not either right? Again Verant did not create the name wizard and it came from a copywrited ficitional novel I believe. I can go on and on about fine line problems (I'm getting tells across the board). I will not go quietly into the night. I only wish you would have accepted my offer to discuss this first without forcing me to take it to these boards.<P>Now I must ask my fellow Everquest players to help me. If I am a solo voice, Verant will ignore me. Please help them see what they are doing isn't possible (and maybe save your own name before you get forced to go by Ximzxtw).<P>Gambit<BR>Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There are two issues that need to be addressed...<P>1) Gambit has had his name for a very long time, therefore, there needs to be some sort of Grandfather clause. GM's have dealt with him before on other matters and not once did they address anything about his name violating policy. Not only that, but they give him some freaky name, while the rest of us have the diginity of having a name we created for ourselves.<P>2) Over the course of the years, his reputation (I won't go there) has been centered around his name. If you change his name, his rep is back to square one. Also, old friends will find it hard to get in touch with a non-existant Gambit and have to get used to some other name.<P>-Docter Stormfist<BR>Dwarven Cleric of Brell<BR>Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Gambit,<P>Your train of logic with the words "wizard" and such is wrong.  I do, however, believe your name was changed in error.  As to the copyright issue, Marvel would own the copyright to the look and feel of the character, not to the word or name "Gambit".  Also, copyright means nothing, even in a court of law, unless the copyright holder can prove loss of income due to the violation.<P>While I agree in principle with the naming policy, in practice it has two major problems:<P>  1. Long-time characters have established an "identity" (with all that entails such as reputation, sense of self, etc) with that name; and<P>  2. The rules *cannot* be objectively applied.<P>Gambit, yours falls into the first category.  Changing the name of anyone with more than 20 or so days played is bad juju.  At 70+ days played on my main, I would cancel my account immediately if his name was ganked.  When I'm playing "Ysgwyrthyr" (my main), I *am* "Ysgwyrthyr".  My brain has constructed a set of autonomic reactions around him, his abilities and his relationships with others.  As a troll, I dumb down my language to Troll-Speak and this is now automatic.  It doesn't happen when I play my alts.  If his name was changed, I would find it very hard to adjust to the character due to the separation.  The human brain is powerful like that.<P>To protect the innocent, I'm not going to provide any actual examples of the second point but here are a couple of hypotheticals:<P>How many people recognise the names in the following list?<P>"Tezcatlipoca"<BR>"Mictlantecuhtli"<BR>"Paracelsus"<BR>"Temujin"<BR>"Sakhayit"<BR>"Tchort"<BR>"Perun"<BR>"Zorya"<BR>"Glasya"<BR>"Bure"<BR>"Rofocale"<BR>"Baalshebub"<BR>"Furfur"<BR>"Bael"<BR>"Beelzebub"<P>All of the names above were real people or names from real world myth, half of them from the Christian myth... erm... religion.  At what point is the line drawn?  Is it just main characters from popular media or does it extend to bit parts?  Who determines whether a book, comic, movie, etc is popular enough to be considered as a violation?<P>Thus, many of the rules are too subjective to be workable.<P>Yzzy</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is ridiculous.  I'm fuming.  Could the GM possibly have given less thought to a decision which affects someone's two-year-old character?  I don't just mean the change, either:  the replacement name he gave Gambit was, "Xrizutr".<P>"Xrizutr"...<P>Did he bother to put down his coffee cup before giving him such a hearty reaming?  It reeks of damned poor judgement and cavalier indifference.<P>*sips java* "Hello, this is GM Xxx. Isn't there a comic book character with that name?  I'm changing it, sorry.  *types random letters*   There you are.  Got a problem?  Email Verant.  Have a nice day." *takes another sip and surfs down the queue*<P>If a point-of-contact CS employee in my company treated a two-year customer like that he'd be on the steps within the hour.  Abruptly naming a character past the lower levels something *incredibly stupid* - especially when the 'offense' is questionable - then saying, "Too bad.  Email someone else."  is intolerable.<P>A note for Gambit:  What in blazes were you thinking?  Your name was fine, but you gave a person who was potentially (and as it turned out, was) uncaring enough to interpret the 'new rules' to your detriment the chance to do so.  I never connected your name to comic books, and I doubt anyone else ever would have unless invited to think about 'how your name could be bad.'</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

It seems anyone that petitions is in fear of being hit but without using sometype of filter it will only effect a few.  So why do it?  Does this put Verant in sometype of copyright violation?

Secondly, someone brought up the argument that if you've had the name for a long time, then you should not be able to lose it.  First, whether or not you should keep your name should not be dependent on your ability to evade GMs.  Secondly, where do you draw the line?  2years? 1 year? 3months? 1week? how long is "too long"?

</FONT><HR>Hey all...<P><BR>Gambit, I feel for you.  Have you emailed the GM yet?  Odds are, you were changed by a Senior Guide, not a GM.  If I were you, I would email the GM and ask her to check the "age" of your account, so that they might grandfather your name in.  As for them giving you a silly Xxibitur type name, they do it on purpose(along with noting your account) so they know that you need still need to choose a permanent name still.  I've seen several people running around with names like "Xxtemp" or "Tempname."  If you don't get your name changed back, then I'm sorry.  It is VI's game however, and they will do as they please.  In the future though, don't put your hand in the snakes mouth like you did, you're just going to get bit  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>&lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
