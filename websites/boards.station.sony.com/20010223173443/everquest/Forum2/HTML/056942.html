And to disallow something like this, on the incredibly rare occasions that it would occur, that is just a nightmare.<P>Just one question, Did the GM take the EE's away?

</FONT><HR>this type of behaviour angers me and at the same time doesn't suprise me in the least.<BR> you need to seriously make your "vision" a little less vague to us verant, because we are obviously jaded. im sorry that you made a spell in the game that allows us to utilize somone elses vested time to gain back anothers. essence emeralds are indeed a complex issue, but if we have found avenues around the ridiculous cost of this reagent, how can you justify your representative's action by giving the necro in question a warning for using your paths that you implemented and set before him????<BR>how incredibly lame. i expect an answer on this. and an apology to the players account that has a warning on it. my speculation is that the idea behind this flawed logic will uncover many issues and mysteries that we the players are contemplating.<BR>keep this one at the top. and i expect it to be locked realistically, with no response from anyone at verant, as are many similiar threads of this nature.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Mogul,<P>Sacrifice is a level 51 Necromancer spell.  It requires an emerald and when cast on a group member, it Kills him with full xp loss, and no chance of Ressurection.<P>This creates an Esscence Emerald for the Necromancer.  This is the Reagent for 3 Necromancer spells:<P>Level 53: Convergence.  <BR>This is the only spell actually used that requires the Esscence emerald.  It is a 93% xp Ressurection. Too bad somebody 45+ had to give up a full xp death to cast this.<P>Level 55: Infusion<BR>Instant 1000 mana granted.  Self only.  No one in their right mind is going to die for this. I'd  Rather save the EE, and use it to Ressurect myself for 93%, than Maybe-not likely, but Maybe-not die cause now I have 1000 more mana.  And, with a 10 min recast, it's not like I can leave this in my book, and mem it quick when I need it.  I really have better things to do with my spell slot than this.<P>Level 60: Trucidation<BR>This is our Final Lifetap.  Also with the 10Min Recast. And takes an Esscence Emerald to deal 1100 damage to the Mob, and heal us for 1100.  Very nice spell if not for the EE and 10 min recast.  Rather use Touch of Night for the 700+ per cast and instant Recast.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>IIK, realized there are only 3 spells to use, and one to create the Essence Emerald, not 4 that use.  My bad..<P>But as you can see, other than the Ressurection, the cost on these spells is way, way too high for their effects.  Infusion should be a Group full mana recharge for that cost, and Trucidation should be Instant Recast, and fully,completly, unconditionally unresistable-- Since a Character 46+ has to lose a full death (3+ hours) of xp, with no chance of Ressurection. Be different if Newbies could be sacrificed, that would be one thing, but this is totally another.<P>--Necridious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I can sorta see their point of view on this, but I can't see how they would actually call it on this necro.<BR>They designed the system. They should have the forsight to see this comming. People quit their game everyday, it was just a matter of time before this happened.<P>Here is why there is a problem with this:<P>You are getting a ton of Essence emerealds for nothing. The player is quiting the game, so they aren't losing anything. If you sell the EE's to other necros, you're making a ton of plat for nothing. It's actually quite brilliant.<P>If I did my math right, you'd get roughly 70-80 Essence Emeralds from sucking a player from level 54 to 46. I've seen them sell for 3000pp each. So, you'd have roughly 200Kpp worth to trade or use.

One of my friends quit their player at level 57, and a Necro friend of mine sacrificed him like 45 times back down to level 51.  People were wondering what was happening (since they bound close to eachother, so they could sacrifice over, and over, and over again), and they all petitioned about it...<P>Sooner or later, a guide came in and demanded explanations from either of them.  Sure enough it was the *real* person on the quitter's account, and my Necromancer friend on his account.  The guide wanted an E-mail from the "quitter", to see if it was okay, before they proceeded to sacrifice anymore.<P>They never did that anymore.  The "quitter" was a level 51 Cleric at the time, and now he's just a guild rez-slave, I think...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Good point, Straithlin, but consider this:<P>Who is the opponent?<P>I've been asking myself this question many times - especially when reading these boards. This is my own point of view (one that very few people on this board share): Verant is NOT our enemy (believe it or not).<BR>This is a game. There are 2 "sides" in the game: The protagonists are the players, whether they are good or evil, the antagonists are the mobs, whether they are good or evil. Some intelligent NPCs are considered neutral (vendors, quest givers, bankers etc.)<BR>The players kill the mobs (unless of course they interact with the neutrals), the mobs kill the players. Verant and their GMs are overseers, creators, immortals, "referees", call them what you will but they are NOT the enemy.<BR>What many people see is this: We want phat lewt + exp. so we can win(?) the game, the mobs are MEANS to get phat lewt + exp., Verant and the GMs are there to prevent us from getting phat lewt + exp., therefore Verant is the antagonist - our enemy.<P>Verant wants players to think smart. Verant loves smart players and they reward smart players, but the players are supposed to outsmart the mobs and the quests, they are NOT here to outsmart Verant. because Verant is not the enemy.<BR>THAT is my point and that is why I consider this kind of "smart" play an exploit of the game...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/redface.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
