</FONT><HR>Verant please just give us a response that you realize a majority of the Hybrid community post 50 is frustrated. You guys have to see the validity of the posts here.<BR>  I understand the difficulty and the fine line that is walked when trying to balance a hybrid vs pure melee. The problem is this. After 50 the uber hunts require the best of the best to be sucessful. And thats it. Hybrids are not the best of the best.  Its our versitility thats our downfall. Just today i was reading over a guild message board about planing a raid on Vernil Sather(sp), It said only Tanks with the Riposte discipline were to take part. And from reading this message board it seems this is becoming more and more common Among High lvls. <BR>    You got to admit, that just sucks. How would you feel to spend all the time to end at a point where the only reason you get in a group anymore is cause you know people or have friends. Yeah, thats good but EVERYONE, i repeat EVERYONE wants to feel they contribute to the cause.<BR>    Idea for a fix, Raise all skill caps for hybrids so thats its more in line with how it was before kunark, Rangers should get a few desciplines. Fix HT and LoH, so that it is good after 50. LoH should be a full heal no matter what buffs you have on. And HT should be a lifetap, That way the resists will be where they should be on a skill that has that long a recharge time. <BR>Anyway just some thoughts.<BR>Cazador Corvine<BR>SK^39</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There is no reason to make Warriors the only melee class with critical hits, critical blows, disciplines, uber weapons, and uber armor.  Their melee is already balanced with respect to hybrids because of their significantly higher skill caps.<P>Because of their already significantly lower skill caps, giving hybrids inferior armor, weapons, and bonus fighting skills represents a double tax on them, which is ironic because their xp (and the xp of everyone that groups with them) is already taxed.<P>These imbalances are most apparent at levels 51 through 60, and have been reported and acknowledged by everyone who plays hybrids at these levels.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>   After reading these posts, I just don't see the vast imbalances of the plate hybrids, so often claimed. <P>   I play a Shadow Knight and am often grouped with paladins, rangers, and who ever else happens to be around. I have yet to see the problems commonly posted on these boards. <P>  Hybrids do have slightly lower AC and lower skill caps. The disparity in weapon power is not as great as claimed. Also each of the hybrid classes can convey an advantage to a group. A skilled Shadow Knight can pull Chardock, Karnors, Fear, etc (exception HATE) nearly as well as a monk. Shadow Knights and Paladins can function Effectively as prime tanks, in Chardock, Karnors, Sebelis, etc. <P>   Yep hybrids aren't quite as powerful as Warriors, Monks or Rogues, in terms of meelee. But Paladins can make damn good back up healers. Also the power of STUN is remarkably ignored.  Shadow Knights do alot of damage with spells, and negate a decent percentage of damage done to them by a mob. <P>  Hybrids each gain power at differnt points post 50. The ranger ablity to cast cholorplasts and greater heal remarkably cut down on down time. I am not saying that Rangers are not without problems. Paladins grow in power dramatically in the late 50s. The potency of superior heal is often down played. While superior heal is no Divine Light, it is still an emensely powerful spell. Shadow Knights grow steadly in power 49+. At 51, my Shadow is no longer second rank tank. GLAUX is a flexible damage dealing machine. My character often has to slide into a variety of roles (puller usually) and is effecitve in all of them. I may not tank as well as a warrior, but I offer a wide array of advantages over one. Shadow Knights are the only tanks that can self heal by doing damage to the creatures they are fighting. Also the power of darkness, shadow vortex, heart flutter, syphon strength, should not be under estimated. Also FD makes us a poor man's monk. Shadow Knights are potentially the most powerful of the hybrid classes. <P>   One thing that makes Hybrids unique is the skill required to play one to the absolute most effectiveness. A well played paladin is obvious to all around them. They use the tools that they have been given to enhance the performance of those around them. A well played paladin or ranger can turn an unwinable fight into an even one. A well played Shadow can do things that few believe until they witness it themselves. Shadows and to a lesser extent rangers are outwardly discrete in the use of thier ablities. Still skill detemines the effectivness of all 3 of these hybrids.<P>   As for the experience penalty... While irritating, and poorly implimented in grouped settings, is not an extreme determent to hybrids. Playing an Ogre Shadow, I suffer a signifigantly higher penalty than most other hybrids. Still I manage to gain over a bubble ever 4-8 hours in Karnors at 51. The penalty is irritating but not overwhelming.<P>Just my opinions,<P>GLAUX GLUGLUT 51.8 REAVER of the OGreISH Kind.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Glaux, as I said before, at level 50 the skill caps for hybrids and warriors are about the same, so there is almost no difference.<P>As stated previously, much of the imbalance has resulted from RoK, which enabled the classes to advance another 10 levels, where the difference is HUGE, especially when you take into account the disciplines, weapons, and armor a typical level 60 warrior will have.<P>You are just now scratching the surface of this at 51.  Please come back and comment again when you and a warrior friend of yours is, say, level 58.  I think the imbalance will be quite plain to you at that point (though due to your very pwerful level 44 pet, your SK won't be quite as bad off as Paladins and Rangers of the same level, in my opinion).   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have often seen the arguement wait till your &lt;fill in level of choice&gt; then you will see that &lt;fill in hybrid of choice&gt; are less powerful than &lt;fill in class of choice&gt;. Frankly the aformentioned arguement holds little value. I have played this game for a long time now, I have grouped with/watched(in RL and in game)/played/talked to/ people that are in the mid to high 50s. I don't see hybrids as broken and I know I am not the only one.<P><BR>  A plate wearing hybrid in full planner with a few pieces class specific kunark can break 1000 AC... not too bad by any standards. Plate wearing hybrids are 22 skill points lower than pure meelees. Once again not too bad. <P>  Hybrids have a LARGE range of spell based power. Spell casting strength increase at in incredible rate post 50. Disicplines are not spells and cannot be compared to them accurately. For example in some situation the monk discipline Wirlwind would be preferable to paladin's superior heal. However Superior heal can be recast in terms of seconds, while wirlwind takes 60 mins to refresh... Of course it is like comparing apples and oranges. Often I see big events sited as a reason that hybrids should have disciplines and why pure meelees are superior to hybrids. Big raids are not 99% of play time. 99% of the time disciplines do not convey the advantages that hybrid's spells can.<P>As for the xp penalty... 54 sucks for everyone. It sucks more for hybrids. It is more of an irritant than anything else. <P>Alot of people on these forums won't agree with me; I am as entitled to my opinion as anyone else here is. <P>GLAUX GLUGLUT 51.8 Reaver of the Ogreish Kind <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Please accept mine that, based on my experience and what I am seeing as a level 58 hybrid, they are not.<P>I believe there can be no argument that hybrids got the short end of the stick in ROK, receiving less skill cap increases than Warriors, no disciplines, many useless spells on their RoK armor, no skill enhancements at level 55 and 60, and a relatively weak assortment of weapons.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Scrith, 200% agree with you.<P>At Lv51, warrior usually doesnt get cobalt armors. Also, doesnt learn discipline too. I can tell you that I have a Lv56 warrior friend & a Lv54 warrior friend, when they duel. It is a big different with them too. Glaux, u will feel that your power = Lv 52-4 warrior when u reach 60. Even if duel or useful in group/raid.<P>Actually, I dont know much about shd. I am not 100% sure it. But in the case of Paladin, you know what is SH in Pal Lv57?? You will die and shout why our back up healer(our great pal) didnt heal u. And the reply is - Sorry, I keep fizzle on my SH until u die, Sorry and TT. You know what will be your fizzle rate after 54,55? Many ppl keep ooc in the game and said thaT ANYONE KNOW WHY I ALWAYS FIZZLE AFTER LEVEL 54,55? haha<P>I can tell that almost all of my spells are useless now.<P>Pacfiy/lull line - only 30% success and bring train to kill your members and u<P>Force/stun line - only stun is useful to help enc, otherwise i keep use my DW bracer. Holy might & Force = useless<P>Valor/AoF/Symbol line - only use without cleric (when will u group without cleric in seb or HS??)<P>YaulpI,II,III line - waste mana and time, use DW bracer to stun better<P>Counter disease & poison - only spell are usefull to share duty to cleric<P>Revive line - Died ppl ask you dont cast on him/her.<P>Divine favour - Dont know who will use it!!!<P>Divine aura - Good spell to pull now and run to zone.<P>DD vs undead line - too slow & little dmg points in Lv50+, all mobs are 5000hp+<P>Frenzied Strength line - I will cast on u if u like, lol<P>Root/Entill line - Good before level 55 and u can park mobs, but useless after it becasue all mobs can summon u. Also, mobs can break it very fast now.<P>Cancel magic line - cast will do it except your group no casters.<P>See my analysis, any common. In addition, we are talking about high level(face Lv50-60 mobs). Not in LG/KC/Sol B. We are in HS, Seb and VP soon.

</FONT><HR>I feel sorry for your groups.  God, a well played hybrid is so much better than you make them out to be.  <P>Just this weekend, we went into the crypt and did the Emporer's room, 2 times, but with one difference on each occation.  We had a Warrior one time (level 56, with great gear) and another time with a level 54 Paladin, with ok gear (his account was hacked and all he had was his fear gear).<P>The difference was quite big, but not in the way you guys would think.  You see, the crypt has a lot of 50+ mobs which a warrior can't taunt for his life.  We succeeded in both accounts, but with the warrior as our main tank, we couldn't kill nearly as much, because he couldn't keep the mobs taunted off our enchanter and rogue.  With the paladin, it was smooth, he kepted the mobs glued to him.  No one was getting hit, but him.<P>At one point, the player of the paladin had to go, and his cousin took over (who plays a warrior at level 50 I believe).  We noticed a huge difference then, he no longer was taunting well, everyone was getting beat on, and things weren't going well (he was bearly casting).  So I gave him a tell to use his stuns and nukes more, after all, you are playing a paladin now.  From there on out, things stuck to him and it was very noticable.  <P>Things died faster with the paladin, because the rogue always saw the back of the mob.  We could pull more often, because the healer didn't spend a lot of time healing the casters or rogue.  The paladin was also a better puller than a warrior, since a paladin can use invis vs undead to his advantage here, and can also soothe.<P>Sure a warrior out does you at the big raids, but in a standard group, I'd much rather have a paladin or SK.  SK's are great for pulling too, their FD doesn't do half bad, and they can take the hits, unlike a monk.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

We are a danger to a groups due to our emense ineptitude, not as players but by the insurmountable disadvantages placed before us by VI.<P>Pretty bleak outlook isn't it?

During "BOSS" raids I may not be able to contribute the same as other classes might, but how much of the game is spent fighting BOSS mobs?

</FONT><HR>How to respond to the stuff here... <P>First off I am not a terrible good Shadow Knight. I still have trouble soloing wurms and few of the stronger guards(45+). I am a decent puller, but not great. I am a decent tank, once agian there are much, much better out there.<P>Paladins: I group with paladins everyday. The notable ones do things that are simply amazing. They fall into the right role no matter what the situation is. A good paladin is a healer and a tank, someone to relie on when everything else goes wrong. For example: In karnors a little while ago, I blew a pull on the hand room. I ended up with 3 of the hands at the moat rather than the 2 I though I had. The enchanter in the group goes LD, shortly after mezzing them. The second mez broke the paladin pulled 2 of the hands back and parked them both. Each time root broke he reparked them. End result 3 hands dead. no one in the group down. Another example: Was in chardock with a group, ranging in lvls from 51-54. 2 Sarnak Mymerdons (sp?) were pulled. the enchanter mezed 1, the shamman slowed them both. Big lag spike hit about halfway through the fight. The cleric and shamman LD'ed. The paladin managed to keep the group alive till both the of the sarnaks were dead. It was close but would not have been doable with out there assistance. I realize both of these stories involved Link deaths, but still I see that paladin's *CAN* do impressive things when needed. <P>It is difficult to compare Warriors to any of the hybrids. Warriors have a very single minded existance, they absorb damage. Warriors do have certain features that hybrids do not. Critical/Crippling hits, higher offensive/defensive caps, 300-500 more hps and the ablity to go berzerk are useful additions to that class. Those ablities are needed to do what they do best, namely take damage, and deal damage.  <P>Alot of people see an advantage one class has as a disadvantage to another. For example, one might interpert: Warriors get critical hits and Hybrids don't; as a disadvantage to the hybrids. The quest then becomes what advantage if any do critical hits convey? Warriors get to occasionally do double damge to a hit. What does that mean in practical terms? Warriors do more meelee damage than hybrid. Many people draw conclusions from this point in the analysis, overlooking other aspects of the problem. Clearly critical hits provide Warriors with an advantage over hybrids in terms of meelee output. Do warriors necesarily out damage hybrids? Well maybe. The last question posed is a bit harder to answer.<P>My point is that hybrids encompass many differnt attributes which make direct comparisions nearly impossible. Warriors have a list of ablities that hybrids do not. This is also true in reverse. Hybrids trade part of there meelee power for the ablity to cast spells. While the XP penalty should not factor into equation, it does not dramatically shift the results. The xp penalty was poorly concived and worsely implimented. Still it is more of an irritant than anything else.<P>How should hybrids be enhanced? Give us more meelee power? Give us more casting power? Give us both? Then the question becomes, at what cost? What would you being willing to trade for more power? <P>Glaux, a tired shadow knight<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Again I see your point Glaux. Not only in LD situations but in many Karnors and Sebilis settings I have seen Pali's save the day with root parking. Pali's have the highest AC/HP of any root parker in the group and can survive the hits while trying to root park 2 50+ mobs away from the group and a lot of times without a heal as the Cleric may be occupied with the primary tank who is probably on the hardest mob in this multi-pulled situation. <P>It would be great if Hybrids got improvements but we do have to seriously ask at what cost? Verant doesnt give stuff to classes without taking something else away if they ,in their infinite wisdom, feel that the class is already balanced. (Im being sarcastic here if you didnt get that)<P>Would I like to see improvements made to Hybrids? Yes, I feel we could use a bit of tweaking post 50. But the cost may be more than we are willing to pay. <P>Bloodwand Macabre 51 Reaver</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi Glaux<P>I agree with you on this note. Every hybrid classes have their good points and their bad points. However, the question is targetted at some minor changes or improvements to hybrids so that they can be most welcome in a group despite their exp penalty or even doing something about the exp penalty. Root parking? An enchanter can mesmerise, hybrids are there as backup parkers. A shaman can slow - after slowing the mobs, any caster can easily park them without taking much damage. In most cases, hybrids tend to play a backup role i.e. if you get a 'perfect group', hybrids play a rather redundant role<P>The way most people look at it, rangers do nice damage, having skill increases of like 4 per level post 50, but often die too quickly. Paladins and SKs can tank quite a bit, better than rangers, but still a distance from warriors =&gt; but both paladins and SKs do too little damage as tanks, rendering their roles in the group as post combat healers. Now what do clerics do? Clerics do not heal the tanks until there is a need to do a complete heal. Smart way of doing things as that saves mana.<P>The good thing for rangers is the improvement in their dodge and parry caps. On paper, it would tremendously help the rangers from getting hit that much, especially when they have a level 55 spell that anti-aggros. Paladins and SKs are deemed by Verant to be 'balanced' but determined to be a liability to many players. I do not despise the players who think this way, but it just makes gaming a bit more unentertaining. When my paladin cannot get a group, I will log on my enchanter and she will get a group immediately - a common sight nowadays. Considering the low weapon skill caps on paladins and SKs that makes post 50 ones increase at a pathetic 3 per level, we tend to miss terribly much in combat, and killing a green creature sometimes drains much more out of us than they should. Paladins and SKs function more effectively as tanks with their shields than using a 2h weapon, grating them higher AC to take the hits. However, using a 1h weapon and a shield significantly reduces the damage done compared to a 2h weapon. Also, double attacks despite our deceivingly high numbers, tend only to happen about 70% of the time, making others raise their eyebrows a little more on our melee abilities. Many think that we do only a bit lesser damage than rangers who in turn do a little damage lesser than warriors. The gap between paladins and SKs compared with rangers is greater than that of the ranger compared with warriors. Very sadly, we do only about slightly more than half the rangers damage, and have about 200 - 300 more hps than them. I would like to state that the comparisons are using weapons considered one of the top rated by the various classes. Again, I emphasise that these are opinions of players who commented on us hybrids, and they are definitely post level 50. The major reasons I can get into groups rely a lot on knowing people and knowing the zone well enough to pull; and the knowing people part plays a bigger role than anything. You can often see a hybrid like SKs and Paladins screaming frantically for a group for hours. Sometimes, I feel we are so discriminated, I disbanded to let these people join the group. Of course, ther are always the people who claim to love hybrids, and would love them in their group, but can they override the party members' differing views?<P>Now for a little recommendation. Verant said that hybrids are going to get disciplines which are gonna be there for show. I guess these disciplines are gonna be a bit useless. A recommendation put across by many shield users since the beginning of the year has been to add critical hits to bashing. It makes sense, but I got a feeling Verant wants to make close fighting criticals personal to warriors. I would recommend triple attack for paladins and SKs since we miss so very much. An additional chance to hit would be nice. Its like hitting 3 times compared to the hitting 4 times by dual wielders. In this sense, it seemed more like the 3/4 warrior Verant has been preaching since launch. And in any case, triple attack would not occur frequently unless its like moved to match the dual wield caps set for rangers. In this way, we would probably do triple attacks about 70% of the time, and only hitting about 60% of these 70% triple attacks. I think its a nice idea when u compare with the number of times dual wielders get to hit each time (4) and the number of times high level paladins and SKs get to hit each time (3). <P>This recommendation may sound overwhelming, but in reality, it is not as potent as it looked, but it will definitely bring a better balance to shield users who have lower weapon caps.<P>Do you think Verant really looks at this boards?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I only read half of the messages, and I am not a very experienced player, but from what I've played and read it is obvious that hybrids need help.  Since it's terribly late and I haven't slept much in the last few days, I'll keep this brief.  Just considering Shadowknights: why should Harmtouch, which I'm under the impression is a skill not a spell because it doesn't cost mana, EVER be resisted?  I don't see how a nuke from an underbalanced player every..what?  15 minutes?..would over-power them.  Let me know if this has been tried or why it wouldn't work/ shouldn't be done.<P>Ferhago<BR>Cleric of Innoruuk, Karana</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The point I hear alot is that hybrids are not broken just we need to be played well. The thing here is Any class played well is going to be an effective as good players are rare commodity.<P>The question here is one of balance lets say you have 2 characters 1 hybrid and 1 warrior. The warrior basically gives more bang for buck, sure SK's can be uber strong but to approach the usefulness of a warrior an SK must excel in his class unlike a warrior who can be just average and still do his job well. <P>Glaux you talk of an sks powers and its correct we have a flexablity but kunark has seen many of our much vaunted skills negated, VI regards FD pulling as not in "the vision and this has been stealth nurfed of late, notice much larger % of casting mobs in kunark dungeons who break thru FD.<P>Our DOTs are total negated if we group with a necro we are made totally redundent. HT is a seriously underpowered skill, Im a level 58 sk on any mob above 51 we almost never score a full hit. and often get resisted, just about every uber mob i've come across still is a total resist to HT.<P>Our ablity to heal is limited by the extreme mana drain and casting time of our lifetaps (bar lifeleech) if an sk blows 50% of his mana he can maybe get up to 600hp in life taps, the higher end lifetaps we get 150/230?hp have hideously long casting times in battle conditions, the idea of swing tap , swing tap..is not workable, now if we had a no delay recap on our lifeleech spell that would be another matter...but<P>Our level 58 pet (44 necro pet) is a fine addition to our class but then again it requires ALOT of skill to learn to use safely in a dungeon enviroment.) and the majority of sks DO NOT use it.<P>Glaux your right in saying the sk can be powerful but for us its an uphill battle to squeeze every last ounce of skill from our class, while many other non hybrids get mightys powers handed to them on a platter.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hope you guys read and try to except the fact that hybrids do indeed make awesome tanks (ranger is still shaky, but I fill the role that a ranger would normally take, so I don't have a good perspective on their abilities).  If more of you would except what your skilled brethren tell you, then you can make steps to increasing your skill to a level of being a great tank.<P>The first step is acknowledging your strength.  I group with some "elite" people often.  People with Trak BP's, epic quest weapons and so on and the best tank I have run into is a paladin, and is lower level than the warriors I group with.  Every awesome camp we've achieved that many consider crazy, has been successful with a paladin or SK as a tank, not a warrior.  Our attempts with a warrior are always rougher.<P>One tip I can offer, since I don't play a high level hybrid (only a mid 30's ranger, but do play a level 58 mage too, both started at the same time), get clarity and med with the casters any chance you get.  This will allow you to use those spells often as they should.<P>I've never seen a better taunting machine than a paladin I group with, and it doesn't matter what he's wielding.  He just taunts like no one else.  It it helps in so many ways.  He also has saved people many times with heals.

</FONT><HR>one quick thing, not entierly off subject, just trying to show that we already have other penalties being hybrids<P>i dont know about rangers, but i do know that paladins and sk's have some of the hardest class specific armor in the game(longer camps, rarer camps, most cases harder creatures)<P>i dont mind that, i enjoy the challenge, but the exp penalty has to go or we should get a few better abilities or current abilities upgraded.<P>i have no problems finding a group IF i can find someone i have grouped with before...no one takes you for being a sk..they take you if they remember you as a good player from before or if they have no other option...by what has been written here i figure it applies to all hybrids.<P>i saw verants response to all this and i can not belive(i dont want to belive) that they honestly told us to wait SoV. Especially after they said all classes would be locked when SoV was released.<P>what this means, is that there will be no more discusion with the players on this subject and we will have to live with whatever their "playtesters" have deemed "balanced" and "group friendly" for our respective classes.<P>i will wait till SoV. i will buy SoV and see what happens. <P>safe travels fellow hybrids...hope it is worth it in the end</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>  I've been playing EQ for about a year and a half, not counting a break during which my account had gone dorment and was deleted. I have had to start over once again, my primary originally was a Paladin, I enjoyed so much playing this most noble class that when starting my current account I again selected to play a Paly as my main. Well, a few things have definitely changed..lets see no one wanted to play a warrior .... the warrior class was greatly improved, they now are far more valuable to a group than any hybrid could ever hope to be. In the mean time we have recieved a few minor upgrades more along the line of fixes for existing abilities, we still pay the exp penalty thus making us even less desirable to a group in effect we have been left behind in the post 50 world.... a statement was released saying we should hold up on our complaints untill after elious is released ... I really hope this isn't refering solely to the 2hpeircing ability...but as for now lets keep our fingers crossed and just maybee we will recieve our much needed revamping with the release .. on the other hand if not perhaps we should all put our hybrids in the closet and start new warriors necro's and clerics join one big guild called the Alternates by necessity and perhaps the lack of any hybrids will spur verant to rethink the class as it did with the warriors</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I do agree that the advantage that hybrids had over warriors has been slowly stripped away... but the experience penalty remains.<P>I am happy with skills that I have as a Troll Shadow Knight but I don't think that they justify the experience point penalty I pay for them over the skills of my Barbarian Warrior.<P>At the same level, with pretty much the same equipment since i just switched it, the warrior is far more effective in combat and is more desireable to group with.  The SK is more fun to play because I can solo a little bit easier and have some spells to break up the monotony of slash, slash, bash.<P>I also know that after I have paid this huge experience penalty and get to the post 50 levels that the effectiveness differences will be even more glaring.<P>The manna increase went a long way to increasing the effectiveness fo the hybrid classes... but the job is not yet finished verant.  Either balance the classes abilities to justify the experience penalty or simply do away with the penalty and let us keep up with our warrior buddies.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
