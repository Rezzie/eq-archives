Evade when it did succede allowed for a cleric not to fly up hate list so fast when they healed a rogue after the skill was used (rogues dont ever use evade right after being healed)<P>In the mess of all the improvments on classes such as new spells or letting them get better spells at even lower lvls i was lucky not to miss the rogue "improvment"<P>Inda Shadebringer(constant corpses runs on tribunal now)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

While spells in place to allow this are OK, the Evade skill (possessed by rogues) let them out of their damage too easily. A rogue that successfully evaded would immediately drop to a level of hate lower than someone who was in the awareness range, but hadn't done anything to really upset the creature such as damage it or heal its foe. This problem was exacerbated by the increase of the size of the hate list implemented with Velious."<P>NERF?  Guess I'll have to log on and see if I'm dying more often.

</FONT><HR>Absor-<P>If you are still reading this thread and making updates, I do want you to note that the rogue is the only class that is 100% group dependent from about lvl 20 on. Or somewhere around there.<P>That is a balance issue that needs to be addressed.

</FONT><HR>I would like to see it possible to turn on sneak while in water, just think about the US navy seals, where would they be if they weren't able to start sneaking in water?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> I can turn sneak on and off on land so I should be able to do that in water too, that would have a very high consistancy.<P>Continuos sneak checks? hmm akin to swimming? hmm just remember that a failed swimming check does not make you start drowning, so a failed sneak check made while sneaking shouldn't break sneak.<P>On the other hand, sneak was never that hard to raise as a skill, so making continous checks isn't really nescessary.<P>Also Absor please remember that we are THE most group dependent class in the game, please don't make it so that we won't be of use to a group due to an increase in mana consumption, we have no where else to go.<P>About our epic: I have heard a few speaking loudly about having bigger particle effects on it. But I kinda like your argument about unobtrusiveness and i would actually like to have the effect removed and the weapon turned pitch black instead, so black that it does not reflect any light whatsoever, now that would be much more in line with our hidden nature.<P>How about a forage skill for poison components? It would remove the tedium of evercamp on greenies. Something radical needs to be done with the whole poison issue.<P>Fact of the matter is I have never really used poison at all, I took the advice from those that where several levels ahead of me and I studied websites for info on poisoning and came to the unasailable conclusion that poisons in their present implementation simply was not worth the hassle/expense.<P>A few numbers: Less than 4% of all EQ players are rogues, which goes to show the class is not that popular due to it's inherent weaknesses.<P>Less than 20% of all rogues use poison, due to the tedium and expense of making them.<P>A few questions: How come poisons are considered spells?? And why do mobs have poison resist when poisons are spells? Why is the poison not applied to the item being poisoned but rather to the slot that holds the item??(Hows that for really broken consistancy? hehe)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Why cant the hide nerf just drop you to in between 4 and 5th or 5th and 6th?  THAT WOULD WORK WELL!  Anywho, I agree, we can not do anything without a group past 20, barb rogues past 25.  Give the burning rapier something to make it stand out and make others say "Ooooo... you got a burning rapier?  I heard that quest was hard as hell!  How did you get it!"  I am proud of my rapier, and it was a long and tedius quest.  <P>     The next thing that needs to be done is forageing poison indegrediants, please, i hate running after greenies.  At least give us limeted tracking, so we can track the dang things.  I dont like being level 30 and running through newbies zones killing tons of giant wasps (hard as hell to find might i add) as newbies camplain for me to get out or they will call a GM.  THIS IS NOT FUN!!!!!!!!!!  It makes poison making useless and hard,  shammys make potions with things that they find at their level, not some level 7 bumble bee.  Something needs to be done.<P>Also, more traps or locked things pickable or sensed by a rogue.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  If you are gunna nerf hide to where you are proposing,  make it work 100% of the time OR make it's reuse time 5 seconds instead of 10.  <P>Seox Shadowstalker of the Nameless<BR>Redeemed Rogue of the 30th Shadow</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>By The Numbers of the Ideas<P>1)Evade Changed but does work as it did before the hate increase.<P>2)DMG sheilds on thrown weapons doesnt make sense.<P>3)Locked chests would be great add to use a skill and would make us more viable in groups.<P>4)Backstab DMG shows in others dmg already.<P>5)hide/sneak<BR> <BR>1)Breaks at looting just rehide.<BR>2)cannot shop while hidden only sneaking and is usefull for food water bandages etc.<BR>3)Does NOT break when trading hide or sneak.<P>6)Haste for Missle weapons would not make projectile faster would actaually affect the bow being held etc.<P>7)Illusion masks. main problem i have here is im barbarian rogue when i wear the DE mask barbarian guards kill me, ok so do DE's why if the barbarians believe me to be DE wouldnt also the DE's??<BR>       And yes should be able to remove the effect<BR> <BR>       Would like more illusion masks also.<P>8)Never checked on invis but hide does overwrite ITU.<P>9)A small safe fall raise would be nice as we still take considerable dmg even when almost maxxed.<P>10)Being able to activate sneak in water ok. however sneak breaking at water would reduce the effectiveness of this skill.<P>11)Full screen poisoning is Possable<P>12)hide/sneak speed increase would be nice but perhaps at higher levels of player and or skill.<P>13)Would love tracking but seems kinda unbalencing to be honest.<P>14)Just silly a Backstab is just that a Stab adding a stun with a blunt weapon is defeating the definishion of the skill.<P>15)Would be great and make alot more use of poison as trade skill to be able to poison arrows and weapons ,At the moment though you do not poison the weapon you are actually poisoning the main weapon slot thats why this isnt poss right now.<P>16)Soulbound lockpicks is like having soulbound daggers lol whats the point .<P>Things that i personally would like to see... <P>1)poison components sold even if at various vendors throughout the world,(For Example)Death caps and Black henbane drop in Sol B sold at Neriak.or Cyclamine corn From Perma sold in halas.This would make it more accessable for skilling and also easier to get i have to wait hrs for zones to get kinda clear to get some components for not wanting to kill the yardtrash for em and take newbie mobs.<P>2)More Poison supply places for vials and suspensions currently there are only three vendors in all of the world.<P>3)More Illusion Masks not so many as we rival enc but a couple more would be nice.<P>4Add to the assasinate ability so that the parameters would stay the same however it can be used once per day on designated target as an assasin would chose his target,example the SK HT<P>5)the possabilty of FD as skill i mean even if its also once per EQ day.<P>Just my 2cp<BR>Sparafacile<BR>47th Rogue MT</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000456-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000456.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000456-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000456-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum13&number=13&thisthread=000456&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum13&number=13&thisthread=000456&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
