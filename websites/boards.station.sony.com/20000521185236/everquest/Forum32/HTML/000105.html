</FONT><HR>Ok,  I really truly do appreciate the higher level characters helping out us "newbies" by giving us equipment and such.  Yendor really helped me out when I first started my Ranger(thanx, Yendor!), and now I am doing rather well.  But is there ever a time when it is a bad idea to twink another character?  I mean, couldn't this possibly throw off the balance of the game?  Don't get me wrong.  I probably wouldn't be doing so well if Yendor hadn't twinked me.  I mean, I've died at least four times after that happened.  Just something to think about; this is in no way a complaint.  I just want to hear about others twinking experiences and how it affected their gameplay(good or bad).<P>Auromar, Half-elven Ranger<BR>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hmm, I think it depends on the amount of twinking. Level 1 warriors running around in Full Bronze with a BIBS and hundreds of plat is too much. Very often people state that it won't hurt you if he/she is twinked. But it does. Better equipment often means less downtime therefore you can take more MoB's. These MoB's could be free for you.<P>The thing is, there is a HUGE difference between helping a lower char or twinking. If you get some pieces of armor or a better weapon, so be it. That's IMHO not too bad. <P>Ellegon<BR>Halfling Druid</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>DONATING to a newbie. Sometimes you'll give them something REALLY GOOD and they'll lose their corpse and therefore lose the item. <P>At level 2, someone sold my warrior a Shiny Brass Halberd for 2 gold. Boy did it simplify my life as a warrior! I got a lot of free items. Did it hurt me? Nah... You still learn what you need to do eventually anyway. Worst thing that could happen would be that the newbie would get stuck on a level for a while, dying repeatedly until he develops his skills in order to advance.<P>AS FAR A "TWINKING" - starting a low level character with great items that your high levle character EARNED... The way I see it is the game is so similar at low levels for all characters, you might as well twink in order to get your character up through the levels you've already seen time and time again...<P>To quickly get to the real meat of the new class that you're playing.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Here's my veiw...when players saw my lvl 6 DE Shadow Knight running around with full bronze armor, there was some jealously. most of this armor I bought with that character. I have a higher character but was difficult to twink when they were so far away. I did however have a 16 dmg weapon transfered to my Shadow Knight. this didn't do much good though since there is a 21 dmg cap until lvl 10, so you see? Verant keeps the balance, No matter how powerful of a weapon you give a newbie he can only hit for 21 dmg. If someone wants to twink a new character it should be there choice, whether you twink a friend or a new character that you started, you worked for it and if yoou want to share the wealth, so be it!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Don't be conceited.  It's not jealousy -- it's the realization that you are PLAYING the character so that you get better, learn how to really play it .. and, to give your lvl 1 necro The best robe, sheild, sword, etc. takes away from playing the game to get the best.<BR>Answer me this: If you give you lvl 1 character the best items they can get at lvl 50, what is the point of playing the game?<P>I can understand giving items to a beginner to make going through those meaningless levels to lvl 5 or 10, depending on the char., a little easier ...  I would do that... you've obviously already made it through the easy levels with the char you're getting the twink items from..<BR>but, much more than that & it's meaningless to even have the character.<P>~Ophilye~</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Greetings to all:<P>Here are my 2cents worth:<P>I have a lvl 38 shaman, lvl 13 mage, lvl 10 monk, and lvl 3 bard. <P>What was twinked three of them, from what, my lvl 38 Shaman. Why would I do something like this, because I worked my buff off fighting, getting coin, grouping, exp, friends, guildmates, item collections etc etc... <P>All this I worked for with my lvl 38 shaman, and these other three characters of mine are not super twinks, *Items that can be bought with some money*, but I started all these characters out with a few trinkets, coin, and armor. Does this take away from my game play and enjoyment of what I kill or who I group with ?? A simple answer is no..<P>Why ?? One of the reasons for this is because of the items/armor I have on my characters, grouped with people it's good to know that you can take more hits then the same lvl newbie beside you *thus protecting him/her from death* because you can absorb most of the damage with the armor or items I wear, more rings, or earrings for INT or WIS great, more mana to cast that nuke spell or sow that player that needs to head to the zone or guards. It's all how you look at it, should it make others jealous of your items, maybe, but that's not why people Twink, they do it because they want to try out another class/race. I have tried out ALOT of classes, including a druid, ranger, monk*twice*, and even had a lvl 15 warrior*deleted for Ranger*, necro, wizard, enchanter. I mean I had alot of characters during my *ONE* characters life time I tried them out to see what was good and what wasn't. I dont mind my mage but he's a wimp, my monks cool because he deals great damage, but can't carry more then 14lbs of stuff, and my bard is nice because I can cast songs while running. All races/classes have a reason for being the way they were made, but twinking them doesn't *IMHO* take away from the game play. You still need to run/fight/die/group with anyone or everyone else, even soloing becomes a bore if you are just standing there killing it all and noone's around to talk to. <P>I say, those that Twink OR *went off topic* help newbies is totally up to them. As long as that person didn't buy their account on Ebay or such ways, then they didn't bother working for anything, or any type of armor or items etc.<P>As for Newbies, I have helped out alot, and I don't mean a sow here bind there. I usually fight in Everfrost *Although at my lvl not much is good exp but IG's*, so I shout to the zone and indicated that I will be having lotto's in halas for *items/weapons*Fs's/and coin*. But I only do it for lvl's 1-10, and if anyone lvl 1-10 ask me when I am not doing this at anytime, I simply say *Get more lvls and come back to me when you have reached 10th lvl and I would be glad to help you out then*. I believe you should work for your lvl's, items, armor, weapons etc but I also believe that people need help, some just *actually* start the game as true newbies and if I can help out I do, it's great and I enjoy the laughs as we play the games. I usually give out about 150pp worth of stuff to newbies at the times of my lotto's. Not much coin at my lvl but it SURE makes a difference to those that won the goodies.<P>So, I say let them be who they are, twinked or not, helped by a higher lvl or not, we all in the end still need to work for our lvls, and die like the rest to learn what our characters can hold or not hold.....<P>GrandMaster Thulgar lvl 38 shaman *and I love him*<BR>Leader of the Mystical Knights on Xegony<BR>http://www.onlink.net/~lbonnah</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>As a 46 druid on Xegony I have camped and bought items in the past that I no longer wear because I have gotten better equipment as my levels have increased. My point being, having a level 20 and a level 7 character also, I don't believe it should be called twinking them because you earned or bought the items you equip the lower lvl characters with. Yes my level 20 druid has a BCP, Mammoth Cloak, Observers Staff, Nightshade Wreath, and etc. But my point being, while playing my level 46 character I camped or bought all the items I have equiped my level 20 and 7 with. Therefore, in my view, I don't consider it twinking. I have put alot of time and effort into getting all the items my 46, 20, and 7 wears. <P>Gedary Moontear  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>Human Druid of 46 seasons<BR>Final StrongHold<BR>Xegony Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
