</FONT><HR>Frustrated? Don’t expect Verant to alleviate your frustration, it’s your frustration and you certainly control it. <BR> <BR>Why are you frustrated? My guess would be that you are like me. I was frustrated, angry even. But it was my frustration. I wanted to level. I’m competitive that way. I wanted to be the best (who doesn’t?) but the roadblock to being the best was time. I can’t magically create more time in my day. Oh I tried. Sleep was the trade off. Who needs sleep? Here’s how my day used to go. <BR> <BR>Wake up two hours before work and play EverQuest. Get ready and got to work in all of a half-hours time. Work my normal ten-hour day. Get off work, rush home, rush my time with my children, and rush my time with my wife. By doing that I could be playing EverQuest within three hours of getting home. Woot! I’m so proud. Begin playing EverQuest, you know, explore or get on a list, it’s our choice. Get to bed about one or two in the morning and wake up three or even two hours later to play more EverQuest. That was about six to seven hours of EverQuest every day. <BR> <BR>You know what? That was futile. My online friends still easily out leveled me, easily became richer than me, easily got more ph4t l3wt. That time frame still was to small to complete quests, yes, six hours a day, divided in to two playing seasons is not enough time to be "good" at EverQuerst. Two hours in the morning and five to six hours at night were not enough time to successfully get on a list and get an OPERTUNITY to random for ph4t L3wt. <BR> <BR>I became angry. I was sacrificing so much of my own life, my family’s life and for what? Nothing, just frustration, I was never going to see a dragon, never enter a plane, never be one of the best, let alone the best. <BR> <BR>Eventually, I figured it out. I have almost completely stopped playing EverQuest. I play when I have the time not when I can make the time. A couple hours there, an hour here an hour there, never more than ten hours a week at the very most. <BR> <BR>Now I’ve begun to question why pay the fee, why continue on? I rarely have fun; I certainly will never obtain anything via a quest or any ph4t l3wt the way I’m playing now. Considering those two things are major components of EverQuest, I’m really hurting in the frustration department. Leveling, well I’m basically frozen in time in that respect. At least I’m still able to explore, well kind of. Ever try to explore in EverQuest in hour-long or two-hour-long blocks of time? You don’t see very much. You also spend grossly more plat than you take in. This type of play can’t support itself monetarily. <BR> <BR>My rogue is just one of many rogues and in comparison to most of the twinked rogues he’s is poorly equipped almost embarrassingly so. Who want’s to be embarrassed? My necromancer isn’t sufficiently group friendly to be included in any group except those of my guild. I don’t play enough for others to know me. To invite me is a danger an unknown to be avoided. This is a fact, a part of Brad’s vision. My necromancer isn’t mobile enough to move with my guild as they move from dungeon to dungeon. I simply do not play enough to be where I need to be in order to get teleports to the guild raids, I don’t make plans to play any more, therefore, I’ve excluded myself by default. <BR> <BR>I’m competitive, overly so. I guess I’ve always strove to be the best. I can’t be the best in EverQuest. I don’t like having to admit that. I now play casually. I find casual play frustrating. Casual play can not support itself in monetary or equipment needs, it is untenable it can not sustain itself. I’m a time-starved power-gamer and EverQuest isn’t designed for me. As soon as I can admit that, maybe, I’ll have enough sense to just find another game where my limited time will be spent in a more satisfying pursuit? I can only hope. I suppose I can ask Verant for help, but I don’t think they can help me. Core designs are core designs they do not change. What might be nice would be for Brad to admit that casual play, whether by a time starved power game or an actual casual player isn’t tenable, isn’t a style of play that can sustain itself. I know, I’m doing it and the plat will run out. The time a casual gamer has to explore is too limited, to can’t actually explore. I digress.<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The post here is well written and thoughtful... and though accurate enough, it isn't the disaster that it appears.  Realistically, EQ was never expected to live as long as it will... and even now, it has a good couple of years left.  Do I like the 'flation?  Nope... but it is the only way they could try to entertain three audiences at once... the "powergamers", the "casual gamers", and the large number in between (including me).<P>I am not Uber.  I will never BE Uber.  I have multiple 50+ characters, but I'm more likely to get my next sub-50 character to 51 before my primary makes 56.  I've discovered that I enjoy the 55- game MUCH more. I play with my friends.  We slowly (and I mean SLOWLY) gather levels and gear... knowing that we'll never be able to go many places.  Does not ever being able to get my Epic weapon(s) bother me?  Nope, not one bit.  Does it bug me that I'll never stand over Phara Dar's corpse?  Nope, not at all.  I have found that I can make the game play in MY world, by simply choosing a subset of the game.<P>For me, EQ is still a game I enjoy.  Yes, the designers continue to do really really dumb things from time to time that annoy me (being a professional game designer, I'm pretty sensitive to things that could easily have been avoided)... but overall, the game still provides a world that I can make my own... that I can create my own experience within.  Though I do wish they had more content that was attainable for the 50-ish crowd, I'm still finding sufficient to keep me interested and busy... even if it isn't at an Uber pace.<P>I guess the bottom line is though I agree they have let mudflation become the path they are following, I don't think it is catastrophic.  There is a large chunk of the game I can't get to... but there is still a massive game I can... and I do.<P>The one exception to this, in my opinion, is the economy... but that's another discussion.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Good post.  I hope Verant considers it.  It is frustrating that every thing gets made harder over time.  Thus it is taking more and more people to do things.  We really don't want to have 24+ people to do fun things post 50.  It takes so much time just to get things started, and then the lag moves in.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Someone mentioned the frustrations most of us feel comes from our own jealousy.  Sorry that's just a sad attempt to downplay what WE know are our true reasons are and no one knows my reasons better then me.<P>The only reason I still play EQ is because I'm not trying to become uber and because I have no desire to join in the uber game.  If I did I have no doubt I'd becoem even more frustrated then I am now and would quit real quick.  But that doesn't change the fact that Verant has greatly erred in the way they neglect everything but the uber end of the spectrum.  But I don't see them changing anytime soon if at all.<P>Morgian<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The issue is mudflation. Sometimes I think Brad thinks he invented that term, but he's not that much of an expert.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>Anyway, when my first Wizard was level 25, she would have sold her soul for a Runed Cowl. Eventually she got one. A year later, as my 2nd Enchanter passed level 55, I wouldn't even consider wearing a Runed Cowl, and they show up in auction all the time now for pretty low prices. Considering 2 level 60 characters can walk down to LGuk and take anything they want there. <P>The point is, there are now items in Velious and still items in Veeshan's Peak that make a Runed Cowl look like trash. Yet less than 1% of all Everquest players will ever in their lifetimes have a chance to loot these items. <P>I'm sorry, but since the primary qualification to be part of the 1% is being unemployed and having no responsibilities IRL such that you can play all day and night continuously, I don't think the distribution of "able to loot" is anywhere near balanced or right in Everquest. And Brad knows it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

You do not play the high lvl game the way you think it should eb played or how it IS played,  players rely on this BP more for the reduction fo downtime vs the mobflation you caused by trying to face down these uber guilds. the BP is only part of the problem.

</FONT><HR>Please consider a *real* economy when comparing to EQ.  Things break.  Repairs Cost Money.  Nothing Lasts Forever.  <P>I work in Chemistry and there is always some sort of 'equilibrium' between what is forward moving and what is backwards moving.  Ever think about having those nice uber items requiring...oh.... repair costs about 10's of kpp after some weeks of playing or some Gems to power their magic?  Many MUDs missed out on this point.  EQ is just a slowly inflating economy because as creatures 'respawn' with items from the 'ether' there a way to take something out of the game.  Only by changing the game to harder monsters or rarer drops can Verant slow down the inflation rate.   <P>How about this for a real SCARY option: every time you DIE some piece of equipment goes POOF!  Just like the mobs die and drop items, you die and the items are taken away.  Make the frequency linked to level to allow lower level characters from not suffer as much.   <P>EQ is not a balanced environment because there is nothing to counter balance the random input of new items on the mobs.  If there was some cost or chance of lost items, then people would need to be careful of what they do, where they go, and actually keep questing for themselves instead of twinks.  <P>Remember, when we die in EQ, all we lose is a little xps or some time.  Mostly, we are all moving upwards in power.  A little balance might not hurt.<P>Rylena<BR>Cleric 48<BR>Xegony<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Rylena,<P>Exactly right.<P>However, if you take away uber items when you die, you must make them easier to get.  Going back to ultima online, I don't know how many sets of armors I went through over the course of 2 years.  Because these items decay, get sold, or get lost, blacksmiths can rest assured that they will have a marker for their things.  If uber items are substantially easier to get, (1 uber item per hour rather than 1 uber item per week and only if you are in an uberguild) I could definitely accept loss of items upon death or repair costs.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First off:  huzzah, Bogmog!!  The sheer number of responses you've garnered shows what a nerve you've hit with the player base.  I only wish you had chosen a different name for the thread--something less likely to bias Verant before they even read the content.<P>Rylena, I like your idea.  One of the things I enjoy about playing Diablo is that items require maintenance, or else they decay and break.  What if we had to have a blacksmith repair our weapons and armor from time to time?  What if some things just plain wore out?  Let's give the smiths and the tailors a practical use (and value) for their skills.<P>I think the real problem with the economy is that items enter the world non-stop, but few things ever go out.  Supply steadily outpaces demand.  If things would break or decay over time, there would be a perpetual need for these new items, and they wouldn't keep losing their value (or not so quickly, anyway).<P>Post_Toasties, I feel for ya, man.  I'm a casual player and always have been, because I just don't have the real-world time to live EQ.  It's expensive (in-game) to play this way, and I know I'll never get to experience many of the "best" aspects of the game.  We just have to shrug and enjoy the parts we can experience.  At less than $10 a month, it's still pretty good entertainment.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I would love to see an official Verant response here.

</FONT><HR>I like your idea Rylena.  I'd even prefer they do that and then lower the experience loss on death a bit also.<P>But I really don't understand why wear and tear wasn't included as a game factor in EQ.  It seems they only wanted to focus on hack and slash which they did relatively well but to truly add more immersion and encourage player interaction plus a healthier economy then allowing armor/weapons to break get old etc and jewelry to loose power over time or break would have gone a long way towards controlling some of EQs problems.<P>But honestly I don't see how it would help address the uber problem so maybe someone could enlighten me.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>As has been pointed out by many others more learned then me, the mudflation thing Brad seems to be obsessed with is the key and one they(Verant) seems to perpetuate each time they patch or add expansions and such.

</FONT><HR>There's nothing Verant can do about this situation.<P>High end encounters must yield uber equipment or else no one would bother doing them.  But this must be balanced by minimizing the amount of high end gear which is allowed to enter the game. <P>There are only two ways by which verant can take to minimize mudflation.<P>1.  Make high end encounters tuff.<P>The result is mass raids by Uber guilds.<BR>  <P>2.  Reduce the spawn/drop rates.<P>Perversely, the degree of rarity of an item is directly proportional to the chance of it being camped (24/7).  Casual gamers have no chance at even camping some of the good spawns, especially during peak playing times.<P><BR>Neither of these two choices qualify as being "fun"  for the average, casual gamer.<P><BR>What Verant really needs is to define encounters which would be challenging and rewarding for a 6 person team, that is doable in a 3 hour span, without igniting mudflation AND yet not be trivial for a 12, 18,...40 member raid.  <P>It's impossible.  Verant is not stupid.<P>From a different perspective, do we all agree that there should be a limit of the number of uber equipment which should be allowed to enter the game?  If we agree on this point..how do you propose to allocate the limited uber equipment?  <P>I believe Verant has taken the most fair way to allocate high end equipment and see no way around this situation.

</FONT><HR>The original poster is dead on right.<P>Post_Toasties & Bloody Grey on Page 4 are dead on right as well.<P>Verant and some other players may think to themselves, "Well, who said everyone should get the uber items? You're not entitled to them. They are there for the ultra-hard core players. Casual players should not be similarly rewarded as hardcore players. That would diminish the accomplishments of those who work harder and longer."<P>As a 50+ player, let me respond to that line of thought. I DO NOT feel I need uber items, I am not jealous of those who do have them. What I do want to do is PLAY. However, as I progress through the 50's on my way to 60, I cannot play this game. <P>I log on and go to a 50+ zone and yell for a group for a long time. Some days I get lucky and get a group (at the earliest) in about 45minutes. Some days I read a book while glancing up at the screen and hitting my "/shout Class Level LFG!" and getting no responses for hours. Yes, hours. Not one hour without response, but more than one. <P>HOURS!<P>HOURS!<P>Let's pause and think about that. I have to wait in line for HOURS before I may begin to play your game. And I don't even have the guarentee that I will even eventually get a GROUP.<P>That's what GUILDs are for you say?<P>Sure, in a perfect world there's these perfect GUILDs. Let me tell you what most GUILDs are like. They are made up of different strangers from different time zones and playing different classes. No matter how tight a relationship these strangers may have formed, none of them make will be there for you when you log on. They have their own set times of play and I have mine.  <P>For us to adventure together when I log on these following conditions need to be met. They have to not be doing anything at the moment, they have to be willing to go to the zone, or I have to be able to go to their zone in a reasonable amount of time, they have to be enough of us, and they have to be the right class combinations ( 2 Rangers and a Bard cannot do a room in your 50+ dungeons).<P>Too many factors need to be met in order for us to adventure together as a GUILD. <P>Why don't we schedule play times? How do we do that with multiple time zone players and odd number of classes? Who decides the odd man gets left out?<P>Right now the only time we get together is during raids. But even those flop if something in RL comes up that our clerics have to attend to.<P>Well, I even tried to solve the problem by getting RL friends to join EQ with me so we have a steady team to play with. However, the same problems arrived. Each of us has our own schedules in RL that keep us from playing together WHEN we want to play.<P>Next time make a game that,<BR>1.&gt; is Pick-Up Group friendly. From level 1-60.<P>2.&gt; doesn't not require a certain class <BR>combinations to function. Any combination of any of the 14 classes should be able to play anywhere. The only thing that is a challenge is the tactics involved. Different combos require different tactics. Not the challenge of waiting around trying to find "X" class to join your group.<P>3.&gt;Players shouldn't be weak at their level because they weren't lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time to get the gear YOU think they would most likely have by then. Gaining items has nothing to do with skill in this game. It's all about luck. PERIOD.<P>I was for a very long time an avid EQ Player up until I realized what this game really boiled down to. Which is what this thread is all about. I thought I'd never say this....<P>....but I will quit if the current EQ enviroment remains so. $10.00 is cheap I agree. But I don't see a point in paying Verant this monthly fee so I can get jump into Norrath and play the "Wait in line" game for hours.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I don't think the problem is in how to allocate it the problem is that Verant continually tunes the game to provide MORE of said equipment to the uber end along with MORE uber encounters which pretty much leaves the majority of players out in the cold so to speak.<P>The problem is in their design period and their methods of dealing with player groups that will outsmart or -beat- their designs and additions regardless of what they do.  But yet Verant chooses to continue in this cycle trying to add challenges as they call it to appease one end of the spectrum whilst the middle and opposite end get... what?  <P>The way their system is now the only way for items to be -downgraded- so to speak is for new and more powerful items to enter the game which require more powerful mobs and harder encounters... it's a vicious and unnecessary cycle IMO and it appears that it's just one they never anticipated and appear to not know how to correct.<P>Just some ramblings before bedtime...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Morg<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I guess you could call me an "uber" player. I have seen Yelinak die 4 times, Trakanon 25 times, raid Veeshans Peak fairly regularly etc.<P>The original poster hits the mark on a lot of stuff. The problem is quite simply power progression. Obviously you have to have some, or there would be no point to do the harder stuff otherwise. Since you want as long a "ladder" as possible the power of the HIGH end stuff becomes quite formidable simply because of the steps before it.<P>I remember my first PoF raid (long ass time ago). Best warriors had 2 ykeshas and a fbss. Most didn't have the fbss though :/   Now those same warriors have 40% haste and 13/20 or 14/24 weapons.<P>Notice this fact too though. The people complaining planes were tuned to the "elite". They were tuned to make it damn difficult for the 8/24 wielding 18% haste people going there for the first times. People breaking PoF now have 9/19 and 26% haste just from grinding in Sebilis. It WAS tactics that broke that place, not item accumulation like some people would like to think.<P>There never were that many places where uber-items meant that terribly much. Obviously 20% increase in melee output means you can reduce 20% of your tanking power, but usually that didn't cause Verant to upgrade mobs. For example Trakanon is still the same Trakanon that he always was. What will kill him is tactics, resists and levels, none of which comes from "ubermobs". What helped people most with slaying him was massive experience with Nagafen and Vox... basically there was a sort of routine to it which speeded things up a lot.<P>This item dependency is changing a bit with Velious though, since some of the stuff is 100% dependant on your melee damage output. That 20% of melee damage becomes incredibly important when the fight either lasts 10minutes or 8minutes. Those 2 minutes means Lord Yelinak will be doing ~1500damage every 2-3 seconds even to your heaviest tanks. This means near 100k more damage which will really make it difficult on the people with less melee damage.<P>With Trakanon nukers were doing significant damage so melee did maybe 70% of all the damage and he lives approx 80 seconds. 14% (.2*.7) of that is bit over 10 seconds, which frankly won't mean terribly much.<P>Yet not that many encounters are affected by this. If the encounter can be done with less than 30 people you can just add 10 more, so those don't count. This takes out all the Treants except Rumbleroot for example. What we're left with are Yelinak, Dain and Zlandicar. Everything else can be done just using tactics and organization... I'd like to see Verant throw a bone to the casters though, it'd also make the high end Velious less dependant on how well equipped your melee is.<P>As for the person saying EQ high end game has nothing to do with skill, but rather equipment I have just this to say: don't blame all your failures on external factors, it really isn't good in the long run.<P>Besides Velious ubermobs the most important equipment there is is resists. Those are available to basically anyone willing to go get them. If you don't bother though, you WILL lose. It won't because you don't have a CoF, its because you have unbuffed resists around 50.<P>-- Delheru Tanreall<BR>Avatars of Discord, Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There is another argument here, and that is that players who have the time to do the big raids NEED this type of game content because, well, thats all they probably have in their lives.  Verant probably over-estimated the amount of these kinds of players, hence the relative under-use of the whole of SoV.  I can't see Verant re-tuning a whole continent, so basically its just a matter of muddling through until something better comes out.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bogmog: your post is pure genius! Bravo!<P>Your post is exactly what is wrong with EverQuest. You hit the nail on the head with unsurpassed clarity and insight.<P>Every employee should be forced to read your post from Brad McQuaid to the janitor at Verant Interactive. I'm sure Brad has already read this thread. Let's hope he has the humility to /agree with the logic of your arguement.<P>Most of today's problems with EverQuest: class balancing, epic quests, uber raids, etc. are all symptoms of how the Vision (tm) has gotten off track. <P>Please keep posting. Your post was brilliant.

Show how Verant can NOW provide nice equipment on non uber encounters yet not see that same equipment farmed by those already uber thus perpetuating the very problem the poster illustrated to begin with.<P>It's impossible, the only way is to be very careful in the beginning of the game you can't go back now. <P>They are doing exactly what they should have, making the high level encounters very very very hard so that the equipment trickles into the game at drastically reduced pace and the cost to that equipment is many many hours of lost experience as a "fee" for it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Excellent post, it describes *exactly* how I feel about the current status of EQ and trying to play the game post 50 without being in an uber guild. Velious to me was a complete rip-off.. there is nothing I can achieve that is even remotely fun as a single group. The problems listed are even worse for international players like myself!

</FONT><HR>BUMP<P>And please lets not get bogged down too much in equipment concerns - the main issue is that the number of one group zones is too few for the post 50s.

</FONT><HR>Good post. <P>To solve MUDflation take items out of the game.<P>I once suggested to do that by letting people die the hard way. Seems VI took notice corpse decays in 2 mins and you aggro mobs by dragging it. Unfortunately it does affect the Uberguilds that never die, becuase they just play too well.<BR>What we also need is weapons and armour decaying. For every hit you do with a weapon there is a risk it will break.<BR>For every hit you take there is a risk your armour will break.<BR>Make durability a major quality of each item.<BR>Adjust decay rates to finetune MUDflation.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053175-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053175.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053175-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053175-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053175-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053175-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053175&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053175&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
