&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>About these lists:<P>First and foremost, understand that this is only a list of concerns to be brought to the Live Team.  This is not a list of promises, and I'm certainly not telling you that any or all of these items will be changed or implemented.<P>Also, there are three types of items that I don't have listed here.  Epic Quests, Magic Resistances in Velious and Mid-level quests.  Those three items were mentioned by enough classes that I've pulled them out for separate examination.<P>All items are currently marked with NONE for status.  Obviously we've already started working on some items, you've seen the lists from the patch messages on the Test Server.  I will be updating the status for items early next week to reflect those potential changes and with any responses from the team.  I just wanted to get these lists out to you fresh.<P>I want these lists to be final as you see them now, but I know there will need to be changes made.  So this list is not final.  But if you want something added to or removed from the list, please be convincing about the change.  At this point I don't want to tack on too many more items, since the team is already reviewing the original list.<P>Thanks for the input so far.<P>Alan<P><BR>Paladins:<P><BR>ITEM:  Defensive Skills.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Paladins would like an increase in their defensive skills, those like Dodge, Parry and Riposte.  Obviously a paladin should be a good warrior, and the design was that they would be better at defense than offense.  But in making any adjustment to these skills, the paladin should not become a better tank than a warrior.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Divine Strength Stacking.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It seems that this spell does not stack with the 50th level ranger buff Call of Earth.  As these seem to be two of the defining spells for those classes at those levels, they would like them to stack.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Stunning.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Paladins, like shadow knights, would like to be able to stun more things at higher levels.  Perhaps allowing stuns to work on some of the more powerful monsters would not be unbalancing.  This might be an interesting idea in conjunction with some other ideas on this list, and might be useful in making the sword and shield combination the signature of the knight classes.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Bash.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Not only raise the skill cap on this, but perhaps even base a discipline on it.  Perhaps one that would allow all bashes to stun (and against any creature) for the duration.  Perhaps even allowing critical hits with the shield.  Again, this might help define the knight hybrids as users of the sword and shield.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Lay on Hands.<P>DESCRIPTION:  There are several requests to make this power better.  Giving it the effect of Complete Heal, allowing it to heal a value equal to the paladin’s base (unbuffed) hit points, reducing the reuse time gradually for levels over 50 and even a discipline that would turn it into a group Lay on Hands.  Also, it would be nice if there was no way that a paladin could use up his Lay on Hands on an invalid target.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Yaulp IV.<P>DESCRIPTION:  There have been requests to add this spell to their lineup at level 59.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Increased Taunt.<P>DESCRIPTION:  With their somewhat limited ability to deal damage, paladins might have trouble taunting.  They would like an increase in their ability to taunt.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Shields.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Perhaps creating better shields for knights.  Ones with better armor class.  Perhaps even finding a way to make shields that can proc on a successful bash.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Wave of Healing.<P>DESCRIPTION:  The recast time on this spell is 1 minute.  That seems pretty long for a 200 hit point group healing spell.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Celestial Cleansing.<P>DESCRIPTION:  This spell might not really be an upgrade to Superior Healing.  And the 30 second recast time makes it less appealing.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Flame of Light.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It seems that this spell does not have a particle effect.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Holy Forge.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Most paladins are unhappy with this discipline.  They would rather see it replaced with a more defensive (or THE Defensive) discipline.  It seems like it might be a fair idea to allow them to have critical hits on undead at all times (though perhaps at a lower rate) once they pass the level where they get Holy Forge now.  If a replacement discipline is chosen, a shield block or bash-based discipline might be the direction to go.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Divine Glory (53).<P>DESCRIPTION:  Some paladins feel that this spell is underpowered, especially when compared to the 51st level ranger spell Strength of Nature.  Divine Glory is a 100 hit point buff.  Strength of Nature buffs 75 hit points and 25 attack.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Divine Favor (55).<P>DESCRIPTION:  Some think that the long recast time on this spell is out of proportion to its usefulness.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Piercing Skill.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Since two-handed piercing is based on the piercing skill, perhaps we should raise the skill cap for the knight classes in this skill.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Lull spell line.<P>DESCRIPTION:  People think this line of spells is too easily resisted and/or causes too much aggro.  They claim to use it more for pulling than for anything else.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Store bought lances.<P>DESCRIPTOIN:  We should probably add these so that the knight classes can practice their piercing skill at the lower levels.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  White Armor and Shield.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It would be nice if paladins in game could look like the one featured on our art, with the white shield and the white surcoat.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  New Discipline Idea.<P>DESCRIPTION:  There is an interesting idea floating around for a discipline that would help make the paladin more useful on raids.  It would allow the paladin to target a PC and, for the duration of the discipline, take half of the target’s damage in his stead.  So if the target is hit for 100 points, the paladin would take 50 and the target would take 50.  The restriction on this would be that the paladin had to remain within melee range of the target and that it would not stop AoE spells or environmental damage.  The idea is that the paladin is throwing himself in the way to protect the target.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Deepwater Armor.<P>DESCRIPTION:  They would like us to re-evaluate the effects on this set of armor.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Trueheart Shield and Theologian Claymore.<P>These items are found on the plane of Hate, yet have a basic graphic.  It would be nice to make them look fancier.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Two-handed weapon minimum damage.<P>DESCRIPTION:  How about making the minimum damage on two-handed weapons a little higher, perhaps based on the base damage of the weapon, to help bring up their popularity.  After all, they should hit hard.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Superior Healing fizzle.<P>DESCRIPTION:  This spell fizzles a lot.<P>STATUS:  None<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Agreed, you really need to suggest that our offense skills improve (not a lot, just somewhat).  Go back to the threads for various good arguments why.  Just giving us a ton of defense will make us lopsided, not balanced.<P>Also, the idea of a discipline that would "rally" (significantly buff) the entire party seemed like a good one to me.  Again, info can be found in the class talk threads.<P>Otherwise, great job summing up.

</FONT><HR>Could you add something about our Rez line?<P>As it is, only one class can really provide ressurections. And that is the Cleric, until level 59 when a Paladin gets a 90% rez.<P>SoW is shared by Rangers, Druids, and Shamans.<BR>TPs are shared by Wizards and Druids<BR>...and so on.<P>XP rezzes however? Just one, the cleric. The no-XP rez doesn't come until 49, at which point my groupmates don't was a revive because they want to save the corpse for a possible XP rez.<P>I am not thinking anything major. What I'd propose is bump the level 49 No XP rez down to level 39 and add the 50% rez (which the paladin does not currently have) at level 49. This will relieve the dependency on one class in both raid situations and grouping situations. (Clerics have THE tank buffs, healing, and rezzes department cornered for the most part.)<P>I realise Verant does not want to cross more skills, but two monopolies on raids (Healing and Rezzing at least) are under the Cleric. The Paladin currently has none.<P>I hope that our Cleric brethern will not scream too loudly at this...but I really think there should be NO situation where a certain realm of downtime is cornered by one class. (In this instance, downtime caused by xp loss and CR time.)<P>With these changes, we will still be a full rank behind Clerics in rezzes, and we never get the 96%er.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Very nice list, Absor.  You have certainly been listening.  Suggested changes:<P>- the argument for higher Bash is pretty strong...I'd like to see more justification for why we feel an increase is reasonable (such as, Paladins and SK use Bash more than Warriors so why is their skill so much lower; Bash is to Pal/SK as Archery is to Rangers, etc).<P>- lack of unique (paladin-only or self-only) spells that help our defense as much as the ranger unique spells help their offense.<P>- inferior armor.  Rangers weapons are as good as Warrior weapons, so why is our armor so inferior to Warrior armor?  We are ready to assume the role Verant has written for us as the defensive hybrid, but our equipment (and a lack of hit points) leaves us lacking.<P>- I know you didn't want to mention Epic Quest suggestions, but the argument that we should have a supplemental Epic Quest available to us wherein we could trade in our 2-hander for a sword and shield combination (much like the Ranger's 2-sword combination Epic Weapon Set) is repeated very often in Paladin discussions and is worth some consideration amongs the designers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I know some clerics will complain that Rezzes is their class defining trait, (maybe you will as well.) but it was way too defining in my opinion. Lay Hands, or even the rediculous Harm Touch cannot come close to the effectiveness that a Cleric's repitore includes.<P>The issue is a big one for me now, considering the difficulty of travel in velious and bind point placement.

</FONT><HR>Why no mention of kick for palis since they are encouraged to use 2 hand weapons because there are no mid level one handers that can really be accuired by a non-twink.<P>Also, if no kick then when a pali has a sheild equiped let them have a chance to Block and attack as well as parry.  The monk may be a skilled blocker but a good sheild will block alot also.  <P>Increase the ac bonus to a higher number for sheild equiped classes.  An example would be a cracked darkwood is 12ac and when equiped I beleive it gives 18ac.  This should be increased by another 25% so it would give 21ac.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>We need our offense looked into. Don't just dismiss this as wanting to be equal to warriors, look into it and test it. There is something wrong post 50, and a lot of times I am only doing 1/3 to 1/4 a warriors damage, even using the same main hand weapon. This is my biggest gripe, post 50.<P>Higher level weapon availability is horrendous. Uber weapons may be supposed to be rare, but with one hand weapons especially, there are almost no average to good paladin only weapons dropping.<P>Re-evaluate the ac on our armor as well as the effects. We are crippled in damage output, yet we cannot defend either? How did we get closer to rangers ac then warriors at high level?<P>Oh, and stop with the silly moral dilema on all our quests. We get bad enough equipment as it is, if we stuck by our moral code and did no evil, we would be useless. If your going to do this kind of thing, make an alternative quest that requires no evil doing to receive similar items. Then make the immoral ones slightly easier. Give people a choice.<P>I really hope we are listened to this time, because an awful lot of high level paladins are fed up with feeling useless. <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It would allow the paladin to target a PC and, for the duration of the discipline, take half of the target’s damage in his stead. So if the target is hit for 100 points, the paladin would take 50 and the target would take 50. The restriction on this would be that the paladin had to remain within melee range of the target and that it would not stop AoE spells or environmental damage. The idea is that the paladin is throwing himself in the way to protect the target.<P>STATUS: None"<P>Im not sure melee range is fair, in a big raid with tons of lag the chance of staying melee range is slim. Also this couldnt be used on any casters or healers who were not in melee range.<P><BR>Lastly, you did not talk at all about the huge lack of paladin weapons compared to other classes in Kunark. And i am elimitnating all the 1h weapons meant for duel wielders than no paladin would ever use.  Yes there are lots in the dragon necropolis, but many people 50-55 cant get to this dungeons.  Please add more paladin weapons to Kunark.<P>Also please just remove paladins from weapons for duel wielders.  it gives Verant the false sense that paladins have alot of weapons when in fact they do not.<P> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>thanks for taking the time to put together these lists. It really looks like a step in the right direction. But I would like to point out something I think you might have overlooked, along with the new Shields, we need more 1 handed weapons, or just incress the drop rate of the ones in the game (So please look at the drop rates of the Halcyon Broadsword, Sword of the Morning, Sword of Blessings, and the Darkmetal Holy water Sprikler all are way too rare). Most 1handers in the game are designed for duel-wielding, but SKs and Palys cant duel wield so a 8/24 weapon is worthless to us, but a 16/24(8+8=16) weapon would be outstanding in the hands of a SK or Paly, but our damage output would still be nowhere near that of a Duel-Wielding class. <P>One topic I would also like to cover is the substandard loot drops and drop rate of quest items from Kael Drakkal. It seems if you support the Coldain and Dragons you lose out on the best no-drop armour for Paladins. Coldain drops the Royal Velium Frosted armour, Dragons drop Guardian amour, but the Giants dont drop any plate-class armour, and even their quest armour is 2 AC higher than the Coldain quest armour with the same stats.<P>Thanks for taking the time to listen to us.<P>Amithraril <BR>50th HighElven Paladin<BR>Mith Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>More Things for your list...<P>1. Define (even vaguely) the role of Paladin.<P>Even we dont know what we are supposed to be doing, how the hell can we make valid comment about changing it ?<P>I personally believe that Paladins should have HIGHER armor class then Warriors, and LOWER Attack skills. The degree of Higher/lower should be equal. If we do 50% less damage, Let us be able to absorb 50% more damage.<P>The fact that every Warrior will scream there heads off at this is concerning, but ultimatley selfish. <P>You will need to very carefully evaluate how much damage we do, how much damage we take, and how effectivley we can heal ourselves to achieve this. I suggest you ask for the paladin community to start sending you logs to parse.<P>2. Re-evaluate spell effiency.<P>We have lesser Wisdom stats, and pay a greater mana price for casting, than any other spell casting class.<P>If you want to leave our healing spells as in, it would be fine by me - AS LONG as we got a trade off. The trade off that appeals to me most, is that the spells we use far far MORE than clerics, the stuns, we should actually be MORE mana efficient at than clerics. FAR MORE mana efficient. I dont know any 50+ clerics that mem stuns anymore. They leave that to paladins and Enchanters. But my stuns still fizlle 2 or 3 times in a row, after i have had them for 30+ levels. Stuns should fizzle less and cost substantially LESS mana for the paladin.<P>3. Revealuate the Discipline Effectiveness and levels.<P>Does it seem strange to you that Paladins should get the Fearless discipline only after we lose the opportunity to kill the 2 most readily raided dragons ??<P>Does it seem appropriate to you theat the Holyforge discipline adds in the realm of only 2 % thats TWO PERCENT damage in the time its activated ?<P>Does it seem approriate that the class that is supposed to be the best damage absorption class in the game has no defensive or damage absorbption disciplines ? (compare this to warrior, rogue and monk disciplines and see what I mean)<P><BR>Thats just a starting point.<P>Define the role of 'Paladin' and I will do my best to be more specific on other issues - and there are other issues.<P>Tsunamix Daemonwave<BR>52 Paladonk Bristlebane.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt; Many complain about offence i see it as we should<BR>&gt; be 1 or the other Defensive tanks or offensive tanks.<P>The thing you need to understand is that no amount of defense can make up for a lack of at least passable offense skills.  Sure, we can take one hell of a beating, eat up all the cleric's mana in the process, and then what?  Maybe have the mob at 75% health because we kept missing and hitting for minimum damage?  Okay, train to zone...<P>Besides, what's the point in being a defensive tank if you can't aggro/taunt the mob enough to keep it off the true damage dealers?  As it stands, the only way to do that (currently) is practically chain cast stun/root/blind, and even then that's not enough sometimes.  Maybe I should just leave auto-attack off, and trade my sword for a Medicine Totem so I have more mana for taunts?  Hrmm, that's an unusual kind of "warrior", but okay...<P>I'm not trying to pick on people's posts, but it seems that the people saying "we don't need offense, we're supposed to be defensive tanks" are only looking at the _ideal_ of a paladin on paper, and not how things _actually are_ in the high level game.<P>Either make us at least mediocre, offensively, so we are considered an OPTION as primary tank, or change our class completely.  Just give us a big ol' 2-handed shield with 500AC, a taunt spell that is 10x any other taunt in the game, double our hitpoints, and rename our class to "holy massochist" instead of "holy warrior".  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Thank you for taking time out.  Your list is pretty comprehensive but I have a few ammendments that I think are important.<P>1.  Offense cap must be raised at least 5-10 points.  The frequency with which we are missing is just not acceptable.  There were no increases in melee skills during levels 41-50 and this just makes sense.  If you allow the offensive skill of paladins and sks to increase at 1 point per level from 41-50 (and then adjust the cap) then the 51+ game would not be so handicapped.  I recommend that you give rangers 10 offense and raise their defense by 5. <P>2.  This will be unpopular.  Do NOT give us more disciplines.  Reseve this for non casters.  Just give us practical spells that can be used in conjunction with the cleric spell.  Instead of a discipline, give us our own Paladin Yaulp at level 53 that would increase the likely hood of riposte and parry.  I am not one of those that believe we are worthless on large raids.  But there are cases where a warrior is and should be preferred - Venril Sathir is an example.<P>3.  Implement not "mid-level" quests but less than epic quests for weapons and armor.  There should be a happy medium.  Give us some quests that we can do with a group or two as opposed to an army.  Simply increase the number of tasks that must be accomplished and make the quests long and drawn out.  We need practical quests to keep our interests.  Hence the name - Everquest.  <P>I appreciate the effort that Verant has taken to listen to the customer concerns.  In the end, Paladins just need to do what we do well just a little bit better.<P>Thank you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Cleric BP's are taking over that job.  Every day I keep seeing more and more of the PoG BP's with manaless healing.  On our server Trak seems to like clerics as he drops quite a few cleric BP's.  <P>Lets face it, at 55+ your heal spells are worthless because of these BP's.  Your buff line (the cleric ones) are worthless because you have a cleric in the group with better.  The stuns last all ove .02 secs so are worthless.  Even if you use your undead nukes your damg out put is still going to be way less then a warrior and you can't take the beating he can.  <P>I dont' see anything up there that is going to balance a paladin *shrugs*<P>Tal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Paladin offense needs to be revaluated, damage output is horrible. Paladins don't expect to be as good as warriors but at least the gap should be narrowed some. As it stands now paladins miss more than 50% of the time. Not having dual weild, lower offense skill, and lack of new weapons due to kunark adds up putting us way way behind other classes. All I think paladins in general are asking is that offense be given an upgrade from god awful to at least below average.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Pali's are getting screwed by people just wanting to make us 1/4th cleric and 1/2 warrior.  Even the "but not beter than a warrior at tanking"  define tanking.  As far as hybruds go rangers can do more damage yet have low hp and deffense that's their trade off.  Why is it hard to understand reversing the role.

</FONT><HR>1a) Raise the Parry cap for Paladins to 200 (Defence)<BR>1b) Raise the Riposte cap for Shadowknights to 200 (Defence with a cruel edge)<BR>1c) Raise the Dodge cap for Rangers to 200 (For god's sake, they're wearing lighter armour!)<BR>1d) Raise the Parry and Ripost caps for Warriors to 225 and the Dodge cap to 200. (I agree, they should be better at tanking.)<P><BR>2) All weapons should have a minimum damage level, and not just two handed weapons. Minimum damage for a weapon is skill-100%. Thus, a Level 20 with maxed skills (105) has a minimum damage of 5% of the output of the weapon. So, if he had some weapon with an insane damage of 40, his minimum damage would be 2. However, at level 30 with maxed skills (155) he has a minimum damage of 55%. With that same weapon, his minimum strike is 22. At level 40 the minimum becomes 105% and so on.<P>This again leaves Warriors as the champs in the high-end game with a maxed out minimum of 150%, while Rangers stay close with a minimum of 140% and SK's and Pallys lag behind at 125%.<P>(This idea may or may not be applied to Bards & Rogues, but should be applied to Monks. I just never bothered to look up Monk skill progression.)<P><BR>3) Give Paladins and Shadowknights crits against Undead starting at level 14. (I believe that's when Warriors start getting them.) If that's too powerful, considering the number of lower-level undead, make it start at level 25.<P><BR>4) Allow all Melee classes to have the Block skill, but only allow it to work/improve when the person is using a shield. With this, the Parry/Riposte improvements for the Paladins/Shadowknights become less required.<P><BR>5) Allow Epic weapon effects to stack with ALL spells. No spell should over-write an Epic effect and vice-versa. (Monks will love this one!)<P><BR>6) While the effect of having low stats is obvious, (Just watch what happens to your AC when your Agl goes below 75) the effect of having high stats is difficult to see at best. The damage output of a Warrior with 250 Str should be OBVIOUSLY higher than the same Warrior with only 150 Str.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It's all true, and I find it quite pathetic. I just can't ignore the fact that I get out-dmg'd by duel wielders (acception of bards) 10 lvls under me, no joke.. I'm 51 and as I mentioned I get outdmg'd by monks, rogues, warriors and rangers easily way lower than me, bards can start outdmging me at like, 4 lvls under me.. heh<P>anyway, as much as I like defense, you can't ignore our insanely crappy offense. don't give me better taunting, give me better offense for the taunt! our weapons go from a 1.5 K Ghoulbane, to a 12K (or so) sword of mournin, that's crazy! not to mention how horribly we lack when it comes to weapon selection.<P>our spells are completely obsolete post 50. <P>the effect on DW armor are so pathetic it's like someone pulled it out of his a$$!<P>someone mentioned getting outdmg'd by pets.. IT'S TRUE! and I don't feel good bout it, it sucks verant, heck, if it was possible people would prolly choose pets without their masters into groups instead of a paladin. we're so underpowered it's unbelievable how you can ignore our dmg output.<P>C'mon! you can do better than this verant, check this out: Wave of Healing, 200 hp heal to the whole group, 200 hp doesn't move even half a bar of any tank when we get that spell, plus, with stuff regularly hitting for 200's at 55+, it's totaly useless. <P>ooohhh, hell yeah! we get a 200 hp buff at lvl 60, while at 59 SK's get a DoT that does 1100+ dmg over a min and a half, not to mention the whole pets issue.. heh<P>another thing, just something to consider:<P>we can revive at 49, right? we can perform a 90% ressurection holy ceremony at lvl 59, right? why not give us a self-only bind spell that will allow us to return faster to where our group died to summon our friends to their corpses? we should be there first together with the clerics to take care of that. now, most people would probably prefer a cleric res, but it's the principel.. we're able to res, we need to be there before anyone else to do so. again, just something to consider that hasn't been brought up yet I believe.<P>another thing that hasn't been brought up in this thread yet is: why don't we get any of the clerical DD's? I mean, our offensive skills are so bad, maybe you could provide us with some spells to make up for it, although it clearly won't, but I'd like to see myself casting something like smite.. I truly like the flames of light spell, but make it drop more often or something please, cause I've seen only like, 2 pallies on my server with that spell currently.<P>just some stuff to think about =)<P>Kainor Skylair,<BR>51 Cavalier of Rodcet Nife,<BR>Rodcet Nife server. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>No mention of offense.  No removal of the double penalty for this skill.  We get a penalty by missing - a lot.  We get a penalty by have our damage capped if we do hit.<P>At level 32, with offense and 2hs maxed for my level (165) I still have a hit rate of 65% against a blue con.  If its a high blue, its below 60% and an even con is under 50%.  I can accept the damage cap, and no crits, etc, but I have been a warrior most of my fighting life.  It is my prime skill for offense.  When in a battle, I am not sitting back and casting spells - I have none that will benefit, except in dire emergency, anyone in my group.  So I stand shoulder to shoulder with the Warrior, slashing the mob.  When the battle is over, and the warrior sits to heal, that is when I can cast my spells, and buff and heal a little, then I sit to heal and med until the next pull.  You'd think, with all that fighting, next to a warrior, I might have actually, by this time, learned how to hit something.  Maybe not as hard, but at least as often.<P>Please, remove one of the penalty's, preferably the one that allows me to hit my taget a reasonable amount of time.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000666-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000666-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000666-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000666-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000666-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000666-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000666-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000666&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000666&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
