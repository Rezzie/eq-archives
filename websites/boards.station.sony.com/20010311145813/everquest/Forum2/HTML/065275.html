</FONT><HR> You can read the previous discussion <BR><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064274.html">Here!</a><P>This is regarding the clerical Plane of Growth breastplates, the ones with the ability to cast Celestial Elixer (the Chestplate of Stability, Akkirus' Chestplate of the Risen, the Breastplate of Forbidden Rites and the Templar's Chestplate). For many of the same reasons that we made recent changes to the Donal's Breastplate, we are going to make some changes to these items with the next patch (which will be next week).<BR>Existing instances of these Plane of Growth breastplates will have the casting time for Celestial Elixer increased to one minute.<P>No new instances of the Plane of Growth breastplates will occur (they will stop dropping).<P>In places where the Plane of Growth breastplates were being created (off of NPC corpses or as the result of quests) new breastplates will be created.<P>Basically, the existing breastplates are having their casting times increased and they won't be dropping anymore, new breastplates will take their place.<P>I'm sorry that these items are being changed so long after their introduction. But this is something that we feel needs to be done for the integrity of gameplay in EverQuest.<P>Alan<P><BR><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]

</FONT><HR>The Caster Robe that drops off Trak has a mana regen similar to the hp/mana ratio of the mana stone.<BR>The effect is called simply Mana Conversion.<P>This is the idea that seems most in line with what VI had intended the PoG BP to acomplish. It lessens down time.<P>It is already in the game. <BR>It is currently usable by wiz, necro, mage and chant0rz.<P>After much thought this seems the best replacement in my opinion.<P>I would be thrilled wth Aego, but I understand that it might be used as a heal.  =(<P>And I laughed soo hard at Kastrina's suggestion of Summon: Peridot!  Tooo funny!<P>Please do NOT replace the effect with BoF, or any other AC/symbol buff that wont stack with Aego. <P>Please do NOT replace the effect with invisibility. We can buy the potions for 12 plat or get our warriors to invis us via their Cobalt anyway. If you (VI) do decide to go this route, consider Improved Invisability. Improved Invis, being almost worth the trouble to obtain the item. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I find it amusing that you even bother offering suggestions to the "new" effect.  When they were nerfing Donal's they originally said that the direction they were leaning was a 7.5 minute CH buff.  After several thread splits and 1000s of posts with many MANY suggestions of effects less asinine and more useful (invis, aego, hero, bulwark, stackable self-buff, divine light, recyclable "charges" of CH, etc) Verant still decides on the lame 7.5 min buff.  They didn't even slide on their original (random?) 7.5 minute timer, nor did they lower the 30 sec cast speed to something more combat applicable.  I think alot of you have some interesting ideas on a possible new effect for this item, but I fear it is falling on deaf ears.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The explanation for this berf from Abashi is flat out BS. A lot of talk, but not a single proven example of how supposedly overpowered the current BP effect is. There is nothing in this game that a group could kill using this breastplate that they couldn't kill just as easily using mana heals.<BR>I challeng someone at Verant to actually try to prove that this breasplate is overpowered. Try to find a mob that does less than 300 dmg in 6 seconds that you can't beat without this breastplate. You will not be able to find one because the reason for this nerf given by Verant is a flat out lie and makes no sense whatsoever. That would prove that this breastplate is nothing more than a convenience and not the game-breaking item they claim it is. I'd really like to hear a response beacause I, and many other people are not buying Verant's bogus explanation. Of course they will conveniently skip this reply. =P<P>Also, there are many ways for 2 people to fight mobs non-stop. Fear and slow for example. Saying that the BP effect was too powerful because it allows non-stop fighting is not an acceptible explanation<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am a really disgruntled possessor of the PoG breastplate.  My other posts/replies on this board are entirely indicative of this.<P>I am very, very close to leaving this game forever.  I did the same with Ultima Online for much the same reasons.  For the most part, this game has been really awesome; however, the recent changes to my primary class (cleric) and the lack of quality assurance on the Team PVP servers (another issue entirely) are prematurely prompting my imminent decision to find recreation in a different virtual community.<P>Anyhow, being the enthusiastic person that I am, I really should offer my thoughts on changes to the PoG BP.<P>1)  Invisibility, no casting time, like the Circlet of Shadows.  Improved Invisibility or whatever, I don't care.  Clerics will save thousands of platinum.  I am already incredibly broke. (its really funny when a newbie spots my PoG armor and then asks me for a few spare platinum.. ROFL!!) <P>2)  Mana Regen Effect while wearing.  aka Clarity.  I feel that the mana regen rate of Breeze is slightly underpowered for such an item.    Maybe Breeze rates while standing, clarity while sitting..  An incredible idea, I would like to commend whomever first postured this.  This would address two issues:<P>        1 - Retribution for the nerf<BR>        2 - The clerics want of more mana as seen<BR>            in the class enhancement threads<P>3)  Haste.  Not your FBSS variety.  I want the full 'Cloak of Flames-style' Haste.  I realize a few people out there are laughing when I say this.  Especially you folks on blue servers.  However, I feel that this would be a lil' something that would support Verant's entire theme of 'Battle-cleric' vs. 'Wisdom-cleric'.. (ROFL, remember when they tossed the term 'Battle-cleric' at us?)  Since we don't double attack, this wouldn't be an imbalance at all (especially considering our crappy melee skill max at 175!!! (GEEZ, GIVE THE SHAMANS AND DRUIDS ONE OF OUR BEST HEALS, THROW US A DAMN BONE AND INCREASE OUR MELEE SKILL CAP!!)) <P>-- Actually, I'd like to see a permanent Breeze effect AND Haste.. That might actually prompt more clerics to melee in PVE... (Beggars can't be choosers I suppose)<P>Whatever the new effect is, I really feel that it should be nice, and not worthless, like most of our non-buff/non-heal spells are.  And it should be something we will REALLY ENJOY.  There are TONS of effects you could put on this BP that we would really enjoy, yet not be imbalancing.<P>I am also looking forward to whatever 'class enhancements' that Verant might have for the clerics.  My decision to stay in this community pretty much depends on that and the PoG BP effect.  The last two patches have been an insult to my time spent/efforts/devotion to this game as it has been designed, and the overall 'fun factor' of being a cleric.<P>Tael Elamshinae<BR>57th Templar of Xanit K'Ven<BR>Vallon Zek<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan posted the following:<P>"Well, it's the combination that matters. It's not just 300 hit points every 6 seconds; it's 300 hit points every 6 seconds, lasts forever and starts even before the fight starts, with almost no chance that the cleric will be attacked for doing it and at no mana cost."<P>I think he over stated FOREVER. NOT LAST FOREVER least of all a heal. Take the cleric BP for instances. The cleric casting this from his/her BP couldn't heal any one else in their group if they kept casting FOREVER on this one warrior. In you instance are you say that only a warrior and cleric need group in high lvl dungeons?????? Do you mean that with these BP a cleric and warrior can kill Lord Nagafen alone??? is that what you are saying BOY I"S SURE LOVE TO SEE THAT. As is it could happen most of the high lvl mob cast and dragon do 300 to 600 a hit let alone going to the planes?? OH boy we only need a cleric and warrior if the cleric has one of these BP.   <P>I think you'd better play a cleric  Alan and cast a heal even after your SAID Changes and see what a mob does. We don't want to hear that you tested it we KNOW how VI tests things. Find a group go after a high lvl mob in Lord Nagafen's Lair cast heal on a warrior pulling a few Imp Protector and see what happens. YOU GET A DEAD CLERIC go test it for yourself. <P>   So, I don't think any cleric would be using the BPs in the way you stated, because as stated the MOB will agroo if they see that you are healing someone  they are attack. EVEN tho you think you've fixed that agro heal problem. (KEY WORD THERE THINK) But if you feel the need to change it more than likely you won't let us use any type of healing. WHAT I"D REALLY LIKE to see is not know spells on these type of item creat something NEW that makes it really diff verus having a spell effect that we could cast anyway. The problem isn't really the BPs ot that you guys weren't creative enough to use something other that know spell type.  <P>  This is but my view. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First of all, why does someone always have to say "First" in forums, seems stupid to me. Do you win something? Or is everyone else a rotten egg or something?<P>The reason why Verant has such disregard for higher levels and the "End Game" is simple economics. It works out better for their profit margins, and is much easier not to care, rather than rise to the challenge of creative coding and game design. To meet such a challenge takes considerable resources, and alot of talent. Things that Sony/VI might not be willing to apply.<P>Here are some reasons why:<P>BANDWIDTH:<P>Everquest's subscriber base is like an ISP's subscriber base. 90% of the resources are used by 5 to 10 percent of the subscriber base. <P>Bandwidth is the most obvious one. The hardcore players, the highlevel ones that keep getting screwed, spend the most time playing, use up alot of bandwidth, that Sony/VI have to pay for. These hardcore players are fully utilizing, and exceeding the $10 a month they are paying in subscriber fees. Basically they are losing money on the players that play all the time, just on bandwidth ( haven't even got to the other issues with these players yet ). Sony/VI want casual players who only play a couple hours here and there, they don't cost very much in bandwidth, this means profit for Sony/VI. <P>This is exactly the same thing that ISP's desire, a bunch of subscribers that only casually use their connections, but still pay the monthly fees. They make all their profit of these people, the 90% that only use 10% of the bandwidth. ISP's are recalcitrant to try and keep the hardcore users too happy, because if they leave they aren't losing any money, infact they are making more since the hardcore user isn't there to eat up more bandwidth then their subscription fees cover.<P>ATTENTION SPAN:<P>Sony/VI know that each  subscriber has a certain amount of time that they will end up playing EverQuest. Players who are in the higher levels are nearing the end of the time they will be playing. Why spend money and effort on players who most likely in the end of their playing cycle, getting ready to move onto something else?<P>DEVELOPMENT EFFORT/ COST vs EXISTING CONTENT:<P>This one is a little more subtle, but has a huge profit motive.  <P>Caring and supporting the higher levels REQUIRES new content such as items, monsters, lands, spells, abilities, and quests. This equals design time, development time, and testing time. This equals dollars that don't go into profit. Sony/VI already has a vast world that has already been designed, coded, and tested. This is the pre 50 lvl world that has been around for 2 years. It doesn't cost them any money ( other than normal maintenance ) to maintain this as is. In fact they have had tens of thousands of people PAY $10 a month to test it for them. This means that if they can just keep a low-level, casual, or new user in the pre 50 plus world, they don't have to spend additional money and effort to maintain their world. Supporting the higher levels doesn't allow this as any high level player can't find anything to do in the pre 50 world other than parlor tricks to impress low levels. <P>Sony/VI would love not to have to produce any additional content, and just sit back and reap the profits off of work already done. This is another example of the ISP metaphor, 90% of the resources going to 5% to 10% of the subscribers. <P>IMMEDIATE PLAYABILITY vs LONG TERM:<P>This breaks down rather simply. You have already paid the $40 for the EQ cd, and probably $30 for the Velious expansion. By this late in the game, the EQ package is fully paid for, hence pure profit, and Velious with its 4 page manual of outdated data and cd that came with it, is surely pure profit also. Sony/VI is pretty sure they can't soak you for much more that way. Other MMORPGs do monthly or similiarly frequenced content updates and such as part of the game, like a feature that comes with part of your subscription. Sony/VI chooses to release content updates in 9 month spaced updates and charge you $30 dollars for it. To ensure that the update is attractive to lower level players, they put usability enchancements into the upgrade. So instead of giving everyone the ability to manipulate inventory without switching resolutions, they make you buy the expansion pack. Velious is only viable for 30 + characters. The casual users I referred to above are who Sony/VI wants to entice into buying the expansion pack. Most of these players aren't at this level of play. So they force you to buy the expansion in order to reap the rewards of usabilty enchancements, which in my opinion should be part of paying for a service. The early/mid-level game is what is important inorder to sell new pure profit game cds. <P>This leads to halfhearted, "comprise" type additions to marginally appease the non-profitable highlevel customers, but still make the game a bit more attractive the casual player who may work their way up to mid levels or who may want usability enhancements only available by purchasing such addtions. <P>Given some high levels buy 2 or more addition cd's to have mule characters. However this is sure to be a small percentage, and for reasons mentioned above Sony/VI does not want these customers. Sure they make the extra money off of the game cd sale, but now they have a hardcore gamer using twice the resources they were before. Won't take long before that gamer eats up the profit of the additional game cd sale. <P>MANAGEMENT CONCERN OVER HOW HIGHLEVELS ARE AFFECTED BY BIAS:<P>The lack of concern over highlevel characters by the upper echelon, probably allows personal preferences to affect changes. Being that only the non-profitable hardcore customers are up in arms about changes being made, management isn't going to question whether program managers or developers are bending the game to their biases. Not necessarily their fault, management usually doesn't know what is actually going on in the ranks below them. They only know what their leads tell them, and what the spreadsheets say. Thus they are number, thus dollar driven. <P> Many people really don't like the fact that it took them 6 months to work there way up when the world was new and uncharted, and now players who come after them can do it in a matter of weeks because it has been done already. Some of those people may now work in positions that they use against the "newbies" they resent. Just like the DM who gets attached to his MOBs, some of the developers and testers might be attached to theirs. The creature that they put so much time and thought into can't be just be kicked around, so they surmise that they gave the players too much loot.<P>I think that it is probably less sinister than this, however I believe it is an angle worth attention.  <BR> <BR>INDICATIONS:<P>What does this mean?<P>1. Highlevel players as a small minority of the subscriber base, cost more to support as they tend to be the hardcore players that consume the resources. Furthermore, since they are a small minority, they contribute substantially less to the revenue stream.<P>2. Casual players who spend small amounts of time in comparision to the hardcore players are a majority, and thus consume less resources while generating a substantially larger revenue stream.<P>3. Highlevel players are likely to be nearing the end of their play time with EQ anyway. So even the highlevel players who aren't resource hogs, are perceived to be less likey to generate revenue for much longer, thus making retaining them unimportant.<P>4. Creating content for the highlevel characters is expensive requiring financial and talent resources to be allocated to EQ in order to design and implement such content. <P>5. Keeping the existing content that has been designed, coded, and tested, is sufficient for players less then about lvl 50. Thus the game requires no further investment in development resources, and is probably sustainable as such for some period of time. <P>6. Sony/VI have a vested interest in selling the cds as the profit motive is high since the overhead has been drastically reduced this late in the product lifecycle with so many copies sold and such an extended time in production.<BR> <BR>7. The highlevel characters have already long since paid for the game cds, thus making the new player the important market since they will need to purchase game cds. <P>8. Management most likely isn't concerned about the costlier highlevel characters, thus allowing less oversight over the actions of developer's who personal biases may affect how design and implemtation decisions are made. <P>SUMMATION<P>Basically it comes down to this:<P>Sony/VI is a business, plain and simple. The marketing crap is just that, crap. They don't want to make a great game, the most immersive world online, or strive to be a great customer service company. They are here to make money. It is really that simple. Highlevel characters threatening to quit doesn't bother them, they are losing money on those players. As long as the short term game is attractive, the revenue will come in, making profit. This makes Sony/VI a good business and that's that. <P>I am pretty sure it is nothing personal against any class or race, it is what the company is here to do, succeed by being profitable.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Expanding on what I said earlier, Tael-XK gave me an idea..  there are 4 Quest BPs right?  PoG, Thur, Kael, Sky Shrine. The PoG BP should in theory be inheritantly evil since it's obtained by killing a good God's creatures.<P>Since I doubt you can put a spell which gates to a different temple depending on your religion on the BP how about having each BP TP to a different zone?<P>The PoG one is evil..  since the only evil race that can have clerics is Dark Elves have that one port to Nek Forest (starting bid point preferrably) or perhaps Lavastorm (if you want to be nice to the non-evil classes that hunted there).<P>Have the Thur BP port to the dwarf starting bind point in Butchersblock.<P>Have the Dragon BP port to the druid/wiz ports in South Ro.<P>Have the Giant BP port to the Tox Wiz/Druid ring.<P>That covers all your clerics from each race and kinda makes sense (though the giant/dragon BPs don't really have any reason to port to those places).  That way future clerics can chose what port they want to get.<P>It would help with resupplying the stupid amount of peridots that we seem to have to go through and  we'd be able to gate back to our bind points (which are by necessity next to where we are fighting since we have to res everyone).<P>Gives us a nice utility spell (you've given it to rangers - who are all good so LF was okay choice) and gives clerics a bit of diversity.<P>Only downside to this is clerics that try to collect the set..  that said it's self only gate so that shouldn't be too overpowering..<P>Vinamin L'Crit<BR>lvl 60 DE Cleric<BR>Midnight Sojourn<BR>Erollisi Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Group Bulwark - we dont have a group armour spell at all and what with the excessive mana and cast time of these spells it would be nice to be able to group it<P>2. 30 or 40 second effect of making our heal spells cast faster or use up less mana.

Ok very limited use as you havnt given us all that much in the way of undead zones.  But it would be keeping in the spirit of the cleric class.<P>Oh i dunno, must be hundreds of ideas.

</FONT><HR>I agree.. invis on the BP would be a total waste of an effect since we can use the Chardok BP that drops off the king there.  Since any cleric that wants to complete his epic has to kill the king to get the scroll anyway you have a reason to be down there.. just pharm him to get a BP.  Warriors want the queen too so you have plenty of reasons to be down there.<P>As for Self Only Gate to temple being useless.. hmm.. I disagree.  Clerics by necessity tend to bind near where the raid/group are fighting.  So we can res peeps when they die.<P>Druids tend to bind somewhere they can't port to and don't change bind points that often.<P>If a druid ports you off to get peridots they have to run back to fight.<P>If cleric has self only port he can port himself, go get cash/bank/restock peridots/invis potions/food etc.. and then gate back to the fight.<P>While yes a druid can bind near the fight, I tend to find a lot of our druid's don't..<P>Now my guess is due to past record verant won't give us invis (even though they already have on the chardok BP) and won't give us mana regen.<P>The self only port doesn't infringe on druids to any extent more than druids have started to infringe on clerics, yet would be very very useful to most clerics out there.<P>That said Verant may surprise us and put relgion restricted spells with self only port to god's temple and then yes that would be a waste.<P>Personally I think I'd still prefer to see a slightly unnerfed Mok on the BP (10hp primary hand only heal) since this doesn't impact on any of the problem area's that Verant nerfed the BP over in the first place.  (10hp per primary hit only isn't going to heal 300hp per tick 100hp maybe).  It won't inpact on uber mobs since reverse DS cause link death as much as DS's do.  But would be useful in normal grouping situations.<P>Yes they have reduced the resistance on MoK so far but it's still a far cry from useful.  <P>Vinamin L'Crit<BR>Lvl 60 DE Cleric<BR>Midnight Sojourn<BR>Erollisi Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok while irratated about the resent Nerfings, as you asked for some suggestions I have a few ideas I think are good.   Some of these exist some not depends on difficulty of adding them I guess.  <P>How about Summon corpse?   Would work well with the Forbidden Rights BP as far as a name.   Still require the component and would only effect down time.<P>Also and idea that could make clerics more interesting.  Add a deity specific spell at say level 50 that would define the particular diety.   For instance perhaps a cleric of Solusek Ro would get a fire based damage spell that is decent for mana/damage ratio.  Perhaps clerics of Rallos Zek would get a spell to do a fairly massive buff to their attack rating allowing priest of a combative god to be more "combat clerics".   Following a similar pattern you could give some decent abilities to all the clerics and they would become more unique by their deity.<P>I also like the TP to Temple Idea.  Whether it is home temple only or any other it could be of great benefit to down time when you run out of gems and supplies.   <P>Oh and how about a "sanctuary" type of spell.   One that is not invis but is similar to invis in that it lowers your agro rating substantially so that you may run through mobs without much danger (unless you are dumb and stop next to one for more than a couple seconds perhaps).  Basically it could work similar to invisibility but have the weakness of time in proximity to a hostile mob where invis allows you to stand next to a mob for the duration of the effect.<P>Kos-Rip<BR>A-Ro<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I still have not seen anywhere verant has admitted that the 300 hp per tick permanent regeneration completely disabled the cleric casting it.  Come on Verant, the BP had a casting time barely shorter than its duration. If One cleric makes a concious decision to keep one tank alive at all costs he can do a lot better efficiency than 300 hp every 6 seconds. <P>Casting the breastplate was only marginally more efficient than casting the full spell and meditating.  THe trade off being the 20 second casting time that leaves cleric and everyone else depending on him defenseless.<P>Trading ALL OTHER clerics abilities for non-stackable 300hp every 6 seconds one ONE target, Still waiting for a good example of "The Problem"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What to say?  How can I express my dissatisfaction with EQ right now?  I have never posted to any of these messages boards, but I am so disgusted with the recent changes to my primary class that I feel I need to voice my opinion. <P>I want the PoG breastplate to have at the VERY least a healing effect like Celestial Healing or Remedy (with a 10 second or LESS cast time).  Clerics Heal.  That's what the entire class is centered around. I busted my ass camping in PoG for weeks waiting for a chance to get my PoG breastplate.  There are lots of other things I could have done with that time.  Not to mention that now I have totally screwed up my Tunare factions.  <P>I will admit that effect on the BP was powerful.  But is it more powerful than effects on other items?  Hardly.  I still had group members die when "chain casting" my PoG BP.  The uber mobs in Velious can still take down a group with a couple of clerics wielding these breastplates.  Can you say Enrage or Flurry?  It was extremely difficult to commit 18 seconds to heal someone deep in the Dragon Necropolis, a PoG raid, or other encounters.  The BP was useless on Vox raids (unless maybe you had a single cleric with a PoG breastplate FOR EACH warrior/wizard/etc...).  The 18 second cast time long enough.<P>High level, difficult to acquire items like the PoG BP need to have actual USEFUL effects.  I want to see the PoG BP have a USEFUL healing effect.  Or I want Veriant to let me trade my Cleric in for another character class of the same level.  It really sucks to be a Cleric right now!  You know it sucks, thats why you have already "re-adjusted" the Heal/Hate values.  <P>I haven't played EQ since I first read about this NERF, the latest in a long line of Cleric nerfs.  And I won't be playing or PAYing much longer.  Unless these issues are corrected.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm not sure if it's been suggested yet, but you could replace the healing effect with the largest hitpoint buf and not have it require any reagents.  Make the buff non removable so it can't be chain cast as a heal if needed.  <P>Not nearly as powerfull as the previous effect but a good solid utility spell that won't make having the BP 'required' to go on raids, but still make it nice.  Would save the cleric lots of money on reagents.<P>I say use the biggest HP buf because the item was preveiously very nice and it should remain so.  The druid BP casts group regroth so maby have the BP do a group HP buf?  If it is the group version maby have it consume one reagent for group version.  Preferable not to have the reagent though.<P>These are just random thoughts feel free to make of them what you will.<P>I'm not a Druid,<BR>But I play one on TV</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Let's take a look at the effects put onto the Kunark/SoV armor for clerics and rate each for usability. <BR>Item   Effect        Usability<BR>====== ============= ==========<BR>Arms   Valor         None. Why would I use a lvl 34 spell to buff anyone when I've got hero+.<P>Boots Abundant Drink Little. This is a lvl 29 spell. If you want to make a 50+ cleric feel like this item is useful, make it's effect sustenance which makes the wearer not need food/water.<P>Glove Armor of Faith None. By the time I get this item I can either cast SoW or BoF.<P>Helm YaulpII      Little. I don't really use YaulpIV much. <P>Bracers <BR>Pacify            None. If Wake of Tranquil actually worked decently, I'd use it instead.<P>Abundant Food     Little. See argument above for water.<P>Legs<BR>Word of Heath     Decent. Would be better if it was Word of Restoration or at least WoV.<P>Symbol of Naltron<BR>This one really is useless in my opinion. An uber cleric gets an item that not only still costs a component to cast but also casts an inferior spell to at least two others he can cast. The best legs he can obtain are not as good as his spell Symbol of Marzin and are far worse than his spell Naltron's Mark. If I were in a situation where I didn't care about the extra hit points given by Marzin, then I still wouldn't use it because Naltron's Mark would symbol my entire party for only one peridot whereas this item would cost me six peridots to accomplish the same thing. <P>Suggestions: Group Marzin or at the very least Group Naltron.<P>Chest<BR>Complete Heal This used to be the item many clerics were striving to get. I was recently next in line for one in our guild but told our GM to forget it. It sucks now. <P>Suggestions: Group Aegolism, Word of Restoration, ManaConvert (all zones), or change it back to what is was previously and make it cost a component to use.<P>Celestial Elixer<BR>Once Donal's was screwed, this became the item to have for a cleric. It was a nice item, the only one left with a decent effect in fact. It wasn't unbalancing and in fact took some skill in deciding whether or not your tank was strong enough to survive 20 seconds or if you'd just killed someone in the party because you started casting the bp and couldn't stop and change your course of action.<P>Suggestions: Group Aegolism, Word of Restoration, ManaConvert (all zones), or better yet don't screw it over at all. I have no problem with you lowering the drop rate, or making it harder to obtain, or even leaving the existing ones alone and making it not drop anymore (I have mine....) as you've done with items in the past.<P>Another idea on the bp would be a new spell as follows:<P>Obliterate Undead<BR>Casting Time: 6 seconds<BR>Effect: 1200 dmg vs Undead<P>It is really poor development planning, testing, and game administration to make these kinds of changes to your player's characters. In any RPG, it is the administrator's responsibility NOT to put an item into their game that they will later regret. If you put items into your game that the players work for many months towards obtaining, and then pull those efforts out from under them, then they will feel betrayed and like they've WASTED their time taking part in such a poorly administered game. Of course, sometimes players will find an exploit or a use that unbalances things because a particular unbalancing use wasn't considered. <P>The two cleric bps are not being used in any manner or fashion other than the exact way they were intended. You right click on them and they cast a healing spell. How can you not decide in testing whether or not that is balanced or unbalanced? That's all it does! You can't say that it is enflated hit points that made you not see its lack of balance. I'm pretty sure you guys could have tested it with 'testing warriors' who had inflated hit points. As a matter of fact, I would have had lots of these test tanks sitting around from when I tested the long term effects of hit point inflation. <P>I'm sick of seeing how many hps per second these items can heal. They can't heal anymore than the spells the clerics could cast with mana. What they gave the clerics was a trade off of a dangerously high casting time for mana free heal versus a lower casting time for a mana heal. With the increase in the number of hps per second that the mobs do, and the inflation of THEIR hps, these items became an absolute NECESSITY for the epic mobs. It should not take more than 5 groups or 30 players to kill any one mob. That fight with 30 players should be a challenge and was regardless of equipment. Some fights were dependant upon equipment to maintain a number of players small enough to keep enough players connected to take something down. Because of lag, you can't just bring in more clerics, you have to make the existing clerics have the mana capabilities of more clerics. <P>If you've never fought the super high-end mobs, you may have an opinion, but it isn't an informed one. If you've never played a class whose best items in game, those sought after by many for over a year, were totally screwed, you have no idea of the frustration that clerics now feel.<P>Tanks have a seemingly endless array of cool weapons from which they can choose. Changing their 9 18 wpn to a 10 22 wpn means little, they have lots of cool stuff to go around. As shown above, clerics don't have much in the way of good items out there. If you take the only two decent ones (save the epic which I'm sure will get nerfed to "REVIVE" soon) in the two bps, you're not leaving them much. <P>No high level cleric is interested in stupid low level effects on their classes best pieces of armor. As a designer, realize that if I'm casting a 58th lvl spell version of a buff, I don't want my best armor pieces casting the lvl 39 version. I wouldn't even throw this crap on newbies who ask me for free buffs. If you're going to give me effects on my best armor, make them useful and appropriate to my level, or they are useless. I won't even use the longer duration less stat spells that I have because I'd rather cast more often and have better stats. The whole kunark+ spell system for clerics was poorly designed. Naltron's Mark should have been Marzin's Mark for instance. Aegolism should have been a lvl 57 spell and group aego should have been 60. Finally, the bps were all we had (save the epic), stop screwing our only good items.<P>Note: There are admittedly a few decent items for clerics out there. I'm mostly talking about the class specific/defining armor.<P>If you have to screw this armor, because you feel its powers are unbalancing, and somehow it took you until after the item was in game quite a while to figure this out, then at the least replace it with an equivalently powered effect. All this crap I'm hearing about making the effect invisibility or some other nonsence is ridiculous. I can cast invis as a cleric with existing in game means that are relatively cheap and easy to get. I don't need my best class armor's chestpiece to have such a mundane effect.<P>Scenario of Note: Guild xyz is composed of 100 players and 150 accounts. 12 of those players are clerics. 6 - 8 are needed for a major raid. Half of them quit. Raids don't happen. Other players/classes get bored and frustrated. End result 60 players and 75 accounts.... repeat over time, ..., everyone finds new game.<P>Thanks.<BR>Cleric PendingNerf<BR>Former High Priest of Brell (now Brewmaster)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Someone had an excellent idea regarding the BP with the CE effect.  Instead of having the effect last for 24 seconds or so, change how much healing occurs per tick and split it up to a one minute cycle.  In other words, it would be somethign like the following:<P>Breastplate of Stability<BR>Effect:  Celestial Healing<BR>Casting Time:  18 seconds<P>Celestial Healing:  1500 point heal over a 1 minute period.  Since you can't stack CE with CE, you could cast it on someone else immediately but not on the same tank but once per minute.<P>This seems like the best idea I've heard so far.  Just make the healing dot last longer. <P>enuf said.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, <P><BR>  You *should* reset faction hits in pog for those Clerics that sacraficed there faction for the BP items. WHY??? simple...<P>We had a *choice* between getting an item we found vaulable by either A) sacraficing our faction and obtaining the item quicker or B) not sacraficing our faction and obtaining the item slower. Alot of people choose to get it *faster* because the BP was valued. <P> For the same reason you claim you nuked the Pog Cleric BP is the same reason why people sacraficed there faction to get it quicker.<P>  If you are going to "retcon" or change the POG BP to another use, you should by all means give people a chance to "retcon" change the faction they lost to get the *orginal* verson. I have no idea what the new BP will do, but people who sacrficed there faction for the original one no longer have that item in its original form. Based on the version we have today, I would of never made the choice to sacrafice my faction. <P>I again suggest that you add the 60th level spell Aeogism to either Donals or the Velious BP as its effect. While its a very good spell, it has limitted use.
