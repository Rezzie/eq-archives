</FONT><HR>Okay, so we all sit back and agree it's an exploit in this one case. Fine. Now, where is the line where it's an exploit, and where it's working as intended. <P>See the problem is, it, like the naming convention, and any other arbitrary rule, are at the whim of Verant if it's an exploit or not. <P>Is 2 times, too many? is 5? is 10? is 50? Obviously 1 time isn't because they put the spell in. Now if It's only 1 time, does that mean they can only cast it once per person? per day? per week? per year?<P>All, I'm saying is that it's time for Verant to come forth and be clear about their intentions of their additions.  I love it when they add neat new stuff, but I don't want to live in fear of someone saying I'm abusing something and get a warning? I can't read minds, and although I'm quite a moral/ethical person, I'm not perfect.<P>It all comes down to communication, or in this case a lack of.  A fine example is the chat room.  Ever notice how a GM or guide in the chatroom when they don't like something just kicks you out or bans you?  Have they never heard of honest mistakes? Have they never heard of explaining why not to do something, in order to enlighten and educate someone when they make a mistake?  Same thing goes when a name needs to be changed in game, or any confrontation. Yes, confrontation is the right word.  Right or wrong, the name needing to be changed, or someone being rude, has anyone in all the captures, seen a GM take the time to explain why the rules are there, where they are, why the name needs to be changed. Of course not, it's much easier to demand the name to be changed NOW or ELSE, and if you don't change it in a blink it's changed for you and the GM is gone. Leaving the customer going "huh?".<P>That's why Verant customer service gets the rap it gets, and rightfully so.  We're human over here, we'll make mistakes, we'll grow attached. We may even tell you off in our anger. We know we shouldn't but we are humans. There isn't a person alive that hasn't at least once lost their cool. Yet we are ALL every DAY treated like cheating kids that should know exactly what is what and why is why.<P>So how about in the future a change in the ole CS policy, that works to educate, instead of accuse, it might do your company's rep a world of good.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>this is hard to tell weither its an exploit after 10 times, five times or not.  What this means is that the game is in the hands of subjectivity in the form of gm's.<P>This is the one aspect of the game that all of you seem to be having problems with.  Alot of matters are handled subjectively and that will lead to discrepincies.  I would like to see more rigid controls at times, but this works.<P>its like art or porno.  you cant define it, but each person knows what it is when they see it, pure subjectivity</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>An exploit?  I think not.  The person being sacrificed agreed to be sacrificed.  You cannot be sacrificed without agreeing to it.  The person being sacrificed pays his money each month to rent some space on the VI servers to play his character.  It is then his perogative to do with that character what he will.  He did not exploit any npc's.  He did not exploit any areas in the game landscape where he can gain exp with no risk.  This cannot be an exploit, as it was agreed upon by two PC's.  No NPC was taken advantage of.  Nothing computer controled was taken advantage of.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR> How is this an exploit? If I wanted to jump off a cliff 1000 times...who cares? Its my character, I gained the exp by playing by the rules. If I want to destroy every piece of equipment I got, is this an exploit too? Is destroying your character an exploit? So the guy got some essence emeralds from it. Big whoop. This is how the spell works. You die, you eat the exp, Necro gets his gem. Correct me if Im wrong here but not too many people would be really thrilled about just volunteering to do this. So basically youre saying that because some guy didnt play a certian character anymore and decided to turn it into an sacrafice mule, thats wrong? How? He built the character up, who says he cant tear it down?<P>Hes using a spell that Verant gave, and he wasnt using it out of regular play. There was no bug or glitch in the game that he was taking advantage of. He did not gain exp or money from this. He got a costly spell reagent and will in all probability will hardly ever be used at all. Alot of the large guilds do this kinda thing daily. Mules and alts that are no longer played become sacrafice mules for guild necros. Its common place for this to happen. The only difference is the large guilds have the time and resources to build the mule or alt back up, this guy didnt care anymore because he was done with that character. <P>To me this isnt an exploit. The necro in question got really lucky to find someone that was done playing and was willing to sac themselves down for the guy. Wheres the harm? He probably would never get an essence emerald any other way anyway. Who does it hurt? Where does the exploit part come into play?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You cant say that Verant never saw this coming though. I mean, a spell that kills someone to get a reagent for 3 spells, two of which nobody uses because they suck. Basically what youre saying is Verants vision for this spell was to spur the economy by having Necros pay through the nose for each and every cast of this spell? Its a reagent, once its used its gone forever. Why the fuss? How does it unbalance the game? Do I gain less exp or money or items because of it? No. Do I have more problems soloing or grouping because of it? No. Wheres the imbalance? Thats like saying a level 4 Bard in full Lambent and a Yak is unbalancing the game...but its not. <P>The GM made a judgement call on this and in my opinion was the wrong call to make. If youre going to allow GMs to run around making calls based soley on their personal opinions and not based on written and available to the public rules of the game, then thats wrong too. Never once have I read anything regarding this spell that says you cannot sacrafice the same person more than X amount of times in an EQ day. And again, you cant tell me they didnt think of anything like this happening. If they didnt want this sort of thing happening, they would have put a time restriction on this spell based on the target. Thus making it a spell that can only be cast on target X amount of times per EQ day or whatever. I just dont buy into the whole exploit thing. Everything was working as intended. <P>Personal opinions do not an exploit make. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

On my server (Innoruuk), I have seen people selling their souls to necros for plat and allow the Nec to "Sacrifice" them as much as they can.<P>Basically, Verant has made a persons exp a sellable commodity now ingame.

If youre lucky enough to run across someone willing to let you sac them for free, youre exactly that. Lucky. By what this GM is saying, every Necro, Mage, Enchanter, Cleric...anyone that buys up or collects multiple reagents is an exploiter. Because thats exactly what it is...a reagent. <P>So if I give a Cleric 300pp to buy peridots, are we cheating because he didnt buy them out of his pocket and they allow him to cast a spell?

</FONT><HR>Im not up in arms Laz. I enjoy a good debate, and this hasnt resulted in any flames, so its all good. <P>The thing is, a GM should not dish out warnings based on their own personal opinions. Would it be fair for folks on Sol Ro to be allowed to sac people down to the limit, but people on Xegony are not allowed to? No. Thats inconsistant to what the game is. If they are going to have rules, set them in stone. Even if they have to do it "on the fly", they should be across the board rules of the game. A warning is a bit harsh for this in my opinion. Warnings will follow your character until the day its deleted, and they tend to carry a bit of weight with them as well. Now if this Necro ever needs help with something, like his corpse vanished for no reason or hes got some sort of bug problem, the GM will see he has a warning on his record and this could sway the GM from helping him, or it could cause even the slightest bit of doubt in the GMs mind about the honesty of this player because hes been labeled as an exploiter. And its all based on personal opinion and nothing more. <P>I know a few GMs and they are hella nice people. Quite a few of em have opinions that dont go along with the rules of the game, but rules are rules. They hate to tell some poor guy that lost everything he owns "Sorry, I cant help you.". Theyd rather give the guy his stuff back just to make him happy, but again, rules are rules. But these are set rules. Not personal opionions.<P>So basically, this doesnt boild down to "is this an exploit?" because its obviously not. What it comes down to is the fact that a GM made an off the wall ruling on something that has no set rule to it, and in the long run its going to dent two peoples accounts and records.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>[this is an opinion of mine, i do think its an exploit to drain a guy on his way out.. i dunno.]<P>How many people quit and come back? So even if a person is very adament about quitting, there is a huge chance he will be back, so in fact, he has not quit and it is his perogative to do what he likes with his exp. Just my opinion based on the neverending number of people that have "Quit" and return a month or two later.<P>Either way though, whether they are selling or giving away their exp, they earned it during the times they were playing and should be able to do as they wish with it.<P>Losing a couple/few levels in a death loop, or on a really bad planes run has never been an issue, so why should using a spell be? At least with the spell someone gets a use for the lost exp.<P>Can someone explain the two guys with the quest mob thing to me, have not heard of that one. But it must have been something highly unusual, because doing a quest over and over for faction is something that has gone on forever (muffins and milk ring a bell anyone?) and is just a part of the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>LOL Erana, you might as well just ask them to take the spell out of the game then.<P>And whats going to happen the next time you bite it somewhere and there is no cleric around to res you. The next logical step would be to ask a Necro, but he cant do it because he can only get essence emeralds once per day. And considering its such a pain to get them in the first place, the ones he does have are reserved for guild raids only. <P>And I think its kinda generalistic of you to assume that the only hackers in the game are necros, and all us necros are out to kill your accounts and sac you down to nothing. Yeah, I know thats my goal in life...<P>Anyway...as far as someone getting "talked into" a mass sacrafice...thats on them. They know going in what it does. If they dont, they live in a cave or they are newbies. Also, theres a confirmation box that pops up asking them if they approve. If they dont approve, then dont click yes. Simple as that. Who knows, maybe they made 10kpp off the Necro who did it and figured you would help them get the exp back.<P>Ive heard of things alot worse than sacs happen to players who got their accounts hacked. Desrtoyed no drop unreplacable items, sold gear, banks emptied out. Its not just a Necro sacrafise thing.

</FONT><HR>Yzara,<P>From my limited understanding, there were two NPCs in Thurgadin that were "linked" in the same quest. The problem wasnt that it was being done for faction, the problem arose when Verant discovered that just by telling one NPC what the other one told you to say, gave exp. So someone pulled this second NPC to the first one and Feigned, logged to clear the hate list and came back in. Now you didnt have to run from one end of the city to the next to do this. This was infact an exploit because the guy was giving decent exp for just talking to him.<P>Verant has fixed this however and the NPCs no longer give exp until the quest is completed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Is it ok (according to Lazarian and VI) to cast Sacrifice as many times as you want?<P>Answer:<BR>No.<P>This makes sense logically, doesn't it.<BR>How bout this....<P>Facts:<BR>1.  Summon Drink is a spell.<BR>2.  Players were given the ability to cast Summon Drink.<P>Question:<BR>1.  Is it ok to cast Summon Drink as many times as you want?<P>Answer:<BR>Yes.<P>--------------<P>The laws of Logic and Universal Truth states that there is no possibility that the answer could be different in these two cases.  <P>They MUST be the same.  Therefore, if Verant allows people to cast Summon Drink as many times as they want, then they consequently cannot deny the same rights to players casting Sacrifice, or they have compromised the entire foundation of the laws of the game.  <P>In real life, this is the equivalent of the government saying that I am allowed to drive anywhere I want because I drive a Ford, but you can only drive to work and back, because you own a Chevy.  <P>Of course, this is silly.  You are naturally thinking, "It doesn't matter if I have a Ford or a Chevy.  They are both cars and I should be able to drive anywhere I want."<P>Similarly, in the case of EQ...<BR>It doesn't matter if I am casting Sacrifice or Summon Drink.

</FONT><HR>Heh heh, again, you might as well just ask them to remove the spells completely then. Because no sane individual who is planning on keeping the sacraficed character is going to be willing to just give up 4 hours or even more of exp just so a Necro can cast a rez. The other spells dont even matter as far as Im concerned because no Necro uses them, its a waste. <P>Look at it this way. The spell works on players between level 46 and 59. First off, you can just get rid of all the 50+ levels because gaining exp is such a hassle in these levels nobody would be willing to eat a full death exp unless they absolutely had to(meaning there was no cleric around). Now, this leaves you with levels 46 to 50 to work with. You can count the 46 level people out since they are in a level after a hell level and will lose twice the normal amount of exp on death. So now you have 47 to 50. Lets just say that someone just got to level 49 and got their new spells theyve been looking forward to for a while. So youre not going to get too many level 49 players willing to take a sac. So you have 47, 48, and 50. Theres 3 levels that would be "most" willing to take a full exp death. Not really a wide selection, and the odds of finding someone who is willing even lessens the chances of getting an emerald.<P>This is the beauty of the players mind. To be technical, Druids were never meant to be so good at soloing. It was only in Beta that some really smart people discovered the uses for the druids powers and it took off from there. Again, it wasnt something Verant had really set up, but resourceful players found it, and used it. With Essence Emeralds, perhaps Verants vision was that this was something that would take a lifetime to gain, or would be so expensive it would spur the economy. In a sense it worked out that way, but there are those who are smart enough, or even lucky enough to gain a bit more. <P>Then again, on the other side, whos to say this is what Verant invisioned? Sometimes I think they picture everyone getting along in game, helping one another no questions asked, no fees, running through Norrath happy as can be enjoying everyones company. So perhaps they assumed everyone would just naturally be happy to eat hours or days worth of exp with the same cheshire grin. <P>My opinion is still the same. Its not an exploit in my eyes and unworthy of a warning on this players record.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Petoffen,<P>The single largest problem with Everquest is that Vi pays too much attention to their intentions and their Vision of how people should play the game, rather than designing a game that functions to their specs.  <P>They continually, say that people are doing illegal things because we are not mind-readers and don't do everything like they want us to.  If they wanted us to not do something, then we shouldn't be able to do it in game.  Period.  <P>It's just faulty design and short-sightedness on VI's part, and they seem to have both of these flaws in abundance.  Now they need to live with it.<P>Kazmo.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
