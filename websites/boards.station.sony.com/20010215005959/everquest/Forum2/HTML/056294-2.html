</FONT><HR>To all the people who obviously don't understand that I'm a cleric, I'm lev 60.<P>From what I can see, alot of people don't have the understanding of what a core spell to clerics is from a Cleric's perspective, the spells we use every day to heal.  Core spells are the most used spells that enable us to perform our role (which is healing).  <P>Beat around the bush all you want, twist words, talk stupid and mock about CH being core (which it isn't), the usuage of remedy and DL far exceed the use of CH.  Remedy/DL is used on pulls with multiple mobs, they are the primary raid spells, used to top off before pulls, etc.  CH is used under controlled circumstances and thge usage is minimal in comparison.  Again, from a cleric perspective, Remedy/DL is used far more than CH.<P>I'd really love to see you say these comments and try to prove it on raids as well.  I'd love to see you reason that CH is a core spell and try to land a CH while fighting any RoK dragon, VP dragon, Wuoishii, etc.  Because only clerics get CH does not mean it is a core spell.<P>It really takes a cleric to understand this and I'm not surprised about these responses from so many non-clerics.  Clerics bread and butter healing spells are Remedy/DL as it stands now.<P>The fact that you want healing equivalents of Remedy and Divine infringes too far on clerics.  If you want that high healing power, there should be a downside to it since you aren't a specialized class as clerics are.  Whether it be a component cost, or a long recast time.  It leaves grouping viable for you when theres no cleric as well as doesn't infringe as much on clerics.  I personally don't like this idea but it seems people are dead set on wanting the equivalents of Remedy/DL, so there must be a downside to having cleric core healing spells.  <P>So I proposed the second solution of SH going down in level, getting rid of these two new healing spells and replacing it with something in between SH and DL.  Again, this would let you get by as healers, and wouldn't infringe as much on clerics.<P>THe point being, you cannot expect to be as good a healer as a cleric and by getting equivalents of their core healing spells it would infringe a bit too much.<P>So you either keep the power and suffer some drawbacks like solution 1, or you go to solution 2 which reduces the effectiveness somewhat but still lets you get by in the 50+ game without infringing on clerics healing as much.<P>Not sure what it is with the 'I want it all attitude', I already read further down the page druids asking for their own form of ressurection.<P>/shrug<P>Guess some people just aren't happy till they get it all.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Why do the bards/pallys/sks/shaman/druids/necros/mages/wizards/enchanters/etc have to sit around waiting around while you get a group almost as soon as you log in? Unreal."<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Correct me if I am wrong, but all those other classes make up the other part of the group.  We have to wait for them just as they have to wait for us.  I as a Cleric need to find a tank, a mezzer, a nuker, a sower or whatever else I *feel* I need in a group.  Suddenly now my needs do not change, but the groups need does change.  I still need a group, but now a group can pick up a Druid or Shaman to replace me.  Like I said, at this point in the game why are they just realizing this NOW???  It hasn't been a problem up to this point (I still think there isn't a problem).  People, no matter what class, still manage to get to level 60.  As we all admit that requires grouping.  So people must still be finding groups, right?<P>Maybe it isn't the class that can't find a group, maybe it is the player.  Ever think of that?  While you are here b***hing that you can't find a group in game, there is someone else playing taking your spot.  The difference, you choose to complain about it and they choose actually look for a group.  And those are the people that are hitting level 60 and finding groups with no problem.<P>There is something to /boggle about.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>cabriolet you are failing to realize that we are playing clerics. If every group requires a cleric then eventually every group will have one. I do not want 1/6th of the players to be clerics, they should be worth more than that . I want clerics to be a completely balanced choice instead of a completely unbalanced uberclass. The proposed healing changes are nice but in my opinion do not go nearly far enough. <P>People complain that druids are overpowering clerics and yet those of us who play both seem to be noticeing that the cleric gets more play time and levels easier .Not by just a small amount either.<P>I have a 57 chanter a 53 druid a 40 monk and my cleric just hit 54 outleveling my druid . The druid has been a character of mine for about 2 years , the cleric less than 3 monthes . You claim its balanced now? My experiences would have to say bull sh*t its balanced now. The druid btw is far and away the weakest of my 4 characters, and is the weakest by a large margin. <P>I can get a group playing any of my characters. Even the druid whos job is basically just to snare every mob (suprising that so few can do this). If skill is all that is required what exactly do you fear cabriolet?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Greater Heal was a significan power gain for my druid.  Standing toe to toe with a mob, heal just isn't effective enough to keep you ahead of the damage the mob is doing.  Greater Heal was quite effective.<P>I know most solo druids kite or swarm/root.  When I realized the power of Greater Heal, I went from 35 - 44 without casting SOW.  What I did was Damage Shield me, swarm the mob, fight toe to toe while alternating DDs on the mob with Greater Healing on me.<P>Since I was able to get to 44 toe to toe with Greater Heal, getting Superior Heal at an earlier level and Remedy ought to make this possible again.<P>Just look for me, I'll be that druid who is solo tanking blues post 50!<P>Shaman will also have some new strategies opened by this.  Better healing in conjunction with slow, haste, the pet, and the 2 minute DOTs will open up some solo strategies that involve much less offensive casting.   At level 40, with slow on the mob and greater heal on me, I was able to keep myself standing toe to toe with the mob for 4 minutes (long enough for two 2 minute DOTs to finish).  This was a very successfull method but produced very slow kills.  (At the time I was doing this to improve my combat skills.)<P>The point here is that because druids have damage shields and shaman have slow, if you make their healing efficient enough, they will be able to tank the mobs effectively.<P>Anyway...

There are many of us who dont feel the current changes on test are a threat because we still feel we bring a lot to a group.<P>Perhaps this is the problem, with competition from other healers we now have to be good at what we do, have social skills, and convince groups we are a better deal.

</FONT><HR>Kiron:  Nope.  It doesn't work that way.  The Cleric will always find a group.  They may have to wait a couple minutes for there aren't 5 person groups stacking up at the entrance of a dungeon hoping for one to show up, who have been waiting for an hour or so.<P>There are more groups than clerics.  This isn't selling donuts.  You can't just whip up a dozen L55 clerics to satisfy a demand.  I've been playing for 16 months and am only L43 (I do things other than powergame - near grandmaster of 4 trades  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ).  My guildleader, a cleric, plays a lot, and her primary is only 51.  It's not as easy as you claim.<P>It hasn't been working well till now.  Groups have been complaining about this since a few months after RoK when the healing disparity/gap became so apparent.  It is even more so now with Velious.  The game has drastically changed.  That's why it is coming up now.  As well as the upcoming cut off on balance changes.<P>Nurok:  Yep.  So?  How is my point less valid because I primarily play a druid?  You haven't demonstrated any reasons why I'm wrong.<P>Cab:  No.  I want to be a healer, which is why I play a healer.  A druid is a healer.  Do you think the game ought to be limited to just four classes?  Warrior, Cleric, Wizard, Chanter.  Sounds really lame.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If they put the druid/shaman enhancements through, clerics are going to need complete rebalancing.  Like Brad likes to remind us, "It's all about downtime".  They will need to find a new, compelling reason to group with a cleric.  Filling that cleric slot with a killer DD or DoT'er will reduce downtime significantly.<P>Either that, or just let clerics be able to quad kite all the way to 58 too...  If clerics give up their job security, perhaps giving them new soloing abilities is in order.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm not worried about it.  Level 53 superior heal fizzles for druids/shamen a lot, so a spell with the same difficulty at level 55 and 60 will be unreliable enough to infringe on clerics.  It will make druids and shamen respectable backup healers, though.  Perhaps 2 druids could replace the curing ability of a cleric, but a cleric would still be the preferred class, by far, primarily because a person who plays a cleric knows how to cure.  A person who plays a druid/shamen will not be as skilled at curing.<P>Of course, if you are a horrible cleric, I guess you have reason to be worried.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Or add some sort of damage shield that is cast on as single person that heals them a few points every time they are hit. Or maybe some kind of temp melee buffs with a haste/regen componenet..."Fervor" or something.<P>I think most clerics dont mind druids and shaman getting better healing powers, but at the same time there is a general feeling that it sure would be nice if they had some better variety and utility spells in their arsenal.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Shame those clerics cant port themselves around so that your group, wherever you are, can get one too - oh wait, soon youll just get one of the 500 druids.  If that happens, clerics will be from 1-60, what they are 1-34, a poor excuse for a shammy/druid.<P>I do object to druids gaining even more power, its not like they are short as it is.  I would not be opposed to shammies getting a better heal, and that seems more in balance to me, after all, druids run around from their 40s with GROUP chloro.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The only way I could see these changes affecting a cleric's grouping chances are if a druid/shaman happens upon a five man group looking for a sixth and snags the sixth slot before the cleric comes on /lfg.  Otherwise, what kind of group is going to see a cleric /lfg and say "Well we have a druid/shaman.  We don't need that cleric."?<P>First, the other priests bring more to the table than healing.  Druids and shaman can buff and nuke and DoT nicely enough.  However, if you're one of these classes and you're the primary healer, you are having your other abilities lie dormant (except maybe the HP buffing role that a cleric might normally fill).  I can't keep up SLN and heal party members and nuke and DoT and evac unless you want to triple my mana pool or face massive downtime.<P>Second, my heals still won't be as efficient as a cleric's.  I'm 51 so I would benefit for now by gaining SHeal.  If a 51 cleric wanders by, he brings Remedy and Celestial Healing (assuming he has it) and CH with him.  Not only does this free me up to take on other roles like buffing and nuking, this brings far more efficient heals.<P>Third, a cleric is insurance.  If you die, I surely can't do anything for you except maybe camo up and drag your corpse someplace for you to loot, but that cleric can do a lot for you.  True, rezzes are not needed after every fight, but oddly enough I sure hear a lot of shouts of different folks begging for a rez so it must be somewhat desireable at least...<P>At 55 if I had a Remedy type spell, the cleric still has me beat.  His fizzle rate will be far less to the point of embarassing me, no doubt.  Also, by 55 I have received even better upgrades to my DD and DoT powers.  By choosing me in favor of a cleric /lfg, you're taking a watered down version of a healer that can't rez you and you're wasting even more powerful abilities that I could be using if you'd pick that cleric up and allow me to be his backup.<P>The bottom line is I am glad druids and shaman are looking at these proposed changes.  We need the ability to fill in when no clerics are available.  However, no group in its right mind is going to turn down a cleric /lfg to fill an empty slot just because they have me.  If that's their mindset, I think I'll just go find myself another group.<P>Clerics fear that people will say they have a healer, no need to waste another slot on a healer but you don't have a healer in me.  You have a wild card that can be what you want me to be within reason.  Group me up and group up that cleric while you're at it and you'll have quite a nice pair to work with.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>dragonace, most of your assumptions are incorrect.<P>"A cleric has to group for most of his career right?"<P>The majority yes.<P>"He/She probably groups with the same people most of the time right?"<P>Not true, lots of times you go for random groups just like most people in the game do.  Some people play with friends as well as random groups.<P>"Now a druid/shaman gets a nice cleric spell at level 55 right?"<P>Incorrect, they get one at 55 and one at 60.<P>"Are you trying to tell me that people you grouped with for most of your career are suddenly going to dump you because a druid/shaman gets one of your spells at level 55? Man do you stink as a groupmate!"<P>Your first assumption is wrong and this simply doesn't hold in this case about being 'dumped'.  No one is going to get dumped, thats no the issue.<P>"Tell me where my logic is wrong here. I guess I just don't see how a druid/shaman getting a new spell at level 55 is all that threatening to clerics."<P>Your logic is wrong because your assumption about clerics is wrong, and you seem to forget that theres also a level 60 healing spell.<P>"You aren't advocating that clerics deserve those high-level groups more than druids/shamans are you?"<P>I'm advocating that clerics core abilities are not shared at the current proposed power.  If the entire game revolved around that balance would simply go out the window.  I advocated upgraded healing for druid/shamans, but not where its almost on par with spells that clerics use the most for HEALING.<P>And its not a whine, its a totally valid issue.<P>Contrary to people's thoughts in this thread, clerics instantly getting groups 10 seconds after logging in is a big miff.  We got to do the same stuff as other classes to get groups.  If you play regularly with people your set.  If their not on or you don't have a regular group, off you go running to zones.  Can't get a group in karnors?  Buy a port Seb, if not run to Seb.  Try for a group there.  All full?  Try to get a port out/take boat elsewhere.<P>Some in fact will sit around a zone and wait for a spot to open up rather than run around the continent (which I will add is simply easy for a druid with ports to check in different areas, and they can do it safely with invis).<P>Everyone has problems getting groups from time to time, perhaps people don't remember the old days in lguk and solb when this was difficult.<P>People continually cry that they can't do anything without a cleric and log for the night and what not.  Honestly, people need to live a little and learn stragedies and use their characters to their full potential.  It use to be the same with enchanters being a must and took time to rethink how to play to get by without one.  Groups adapted and they can get by alot more now without enchanters.<P>Why is it that classes like druids, who out number clerics by a HUGE margin don't stop to ask themselves questions before asking for core abilities from another class.  Did you ever ask yourselves why there are so few clerics in the game that supposedly so greatly affect your ability to play the game?  Man, druids are the most played class in the game, hugely outnumbering clerics.  Now take this scenario:<P>Total # of druids<BR>Total # of clerics<P>Now give those druids, 2 of the most used cleric healing spells.<P>Then relook at those numbers and tell me what you think.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Your level 60 group buff has a mana regen just a little worse than clarity, AND it is a group buff and benefits every caster in your group.  Now THATS a huge downtime reducer.  You get a druid to regen everyone's mana faster, or you get a cleric and suffer no regen.  Considering theres a shaman in there healing would be minimal and chances are with slow cleric healing won't be needed much.  There are also spells you have that can help to reduce downtime and mitigate healing somewhat.  Regens, dots, damage shields and DD's as mana permits.<P>"Second, my heals still won't be as efficient as a cleric's. I'm 51 so I would benefit for now by gaining SHeal. If a 51 cleric wanders by, he brings Remedy and Celestial Healing (assuming he has it) and CH with him. Not only does this free me up to take on other roles like buffing and nuking, this brings far more efficient heals.<BR>"<P>True, but with a shaman and druid in a group, you won't need healing power of CH.

When RoK first came out I use to play in Karnors and ran to BW when I couldn't get a group.  Simply put in an outdoor zone it would be difficult because people just didn't need much healing.  They'd be more than happy not to grop you so they could be more efficent for getting exp.  Of course, they were more than happy to call on you when they died for a res.<P>I guess my point is that there are alot of circumstances already where a druid/shammie would be prefered.  The versatility is the reason why this is so.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I didn't forget about the level 60 either, but that is even less of an issue because of it's level (fewer druids/shamans at level 60 than level 55 right?)<P>I do think that you are overlooking something though.  In your examples you stated about looking for groups and outdoor zones and such you keep bringing up things that druids/shamans already have (such as ports/sow/snare/etc) as reasons that people would want druids/shamans over clerics.<P>Ummm... I thought this was about how the new spells would make druids/shamans more desireable in high-level groups.  I don't think that anyone disagrees that druids/shamans are great in big outdoor zones, but sorry to say in the late game for exp.& loot not many of those zones around.<P>Most end-game raids & adventuring is done in dungeons and the planes right?  Well, this is where druids/shamans thought they were severely lacking.  And maybe, just maybe these two spells will help.<P>should clerics receive something around mid-level to help them in the large outdoor zones?  You bet!  Keep posting your ideas to Absor's class threads and maybe you guys will get some needed help in that area.<P>I think the real problem people have with these kind of posts is that you are trying to stiffle another class (or two) for your own gain.  That is a bad thing.  Instead push for a gain for your own class.  That is good thing for everyone.  See the difference?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ply another class, you have absolutely no perspective here.  The only times people will turn down a cleric is if they had a friend they'd rather have or they are doing some sort of small group thing that only needs 3 players in a group or so (very small amount of what most people want to do).  Oh yeah, and one other reason I personally have turned down clerics, they totally sucked at their class, and didn't know how to use CH.<P>The sad thing is, if these changes allow groups to function without a cleric (which it won't really help much.), clerics are going to quit, because they were used to being the sole person every group needed.<P>Even if you cast remedy more than you cast CH, you heal more or at least equal the amount of health in a night with CH, which saved you a ton of mana.  I can recall a cleric trying to keep everyone alive using nothing but remedy, she kept going OOM after every other fight.  We then taught her how to CH, and we had nearly non stop action.<P>Get over yourselves!<P>Zanten - level 59.85 mage, retired because of this issue a month ago</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Your core ability is a spell you get a level 14? How sad. What about the cliche of "jack of all trades, master of none"? So in fact, your core abilities are everyone's core abilities (well, at least that of the casting classes), just to a lesser degree.<P>Nice argument there, but not true at all. If sow is your only core ability, what about your dd, dot's, regen, ports, and who knows how many other utility spells? Guess those aren't core, huh? Mind if I have them too then?

</FONT><HR>im a shammy and i agree with the originator of this thread.  remedy shouldn't be given to shamans and druids.  while i would love this, we're not primary healers.  you want a healer?  get a cleric.  lowering the fizzle rates and the levels required to get the spells we currently have are fine, but remedy should be cleric only.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Is it just me or are Gizzin and BROWitterquick<BR>the only other people who see flaws in all of this whining?<P>I for one welcome other classes getting additional healing capabilities. <P>Honestly, with all of the other spells that druid/shaman get, do you really think they want to sit there and pretend their a cleric the rest of their career?  Once they are the dedicated healer to the group, I can't imagine anyone suggesting they Nuke/DoT.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/confused.gif"> Any mana they use on offense could have been mana that saved a tank or caster from dying. <P>I can almost guarantee the above situation will happen to someone at some point, and they will never, ever group with a non-cleric who spends mana on the offense when designated as primary healer.<P>I admit, from 1-34 I did spend time waiting on groups because they already had a druid/shaman to cover heals.  Do I now feel threatened this will happen again?  No.  I feel more secure knowing that I have better opportuinties for Complete Heal if a Shaman/Druid is in the group since they can effectively cover other heals while waiting the 90 minutes for CH to cast.  And just for the record, I've lost ONE tank (a ranger) to a bad CH timing.  Of course, having 3 mobs on him didn't help the situation.<P>Of course, I'm not really qualifed to speak, since I haven't PL my cleric and he's actually at over 46 days played for level 47.  I've made the awful mistake of actually enjoying the game rather than just getting to 60 as quickly as possible.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is hilarious....<BR>A cleric takes time to post a valid reason why he feels discouraged about the new changes, and nearly all the early posts are:<P> "Great, another rambling cleric" or "You whining clerics are too much". Why not just "U SUxx0rs!" ? <P>I used to think that most of the vocal druids out there were well meaning posters who simply feel they do not contribute to the group. This belief was SHATTERED when I looked at the cleric posts and all of the flames given to them by notorious druids. <P>Clerics post well-thought out ideas in hopes to help give their view on the subject, but are immediately pounced on by the jeers and boos of the druid hoard. I really find this disturbing... <BR>For those druids out there who still hold some sort of decency or integrity, please scan through the responses to some of the cleric posts (Not the intentially flames by someone who claims to be a cleric, I mean the ones that TELL you why clerics are feeling bad and upset) and I think you'll see why there is some anti-druid feelings.<P>For every 1 thought-out druid response to the issues other classes have with druids, I see 5, even 10 angry druid posters screaming bloody murder. This intrigues me..<P>It is a well established fact that druids are intented to be "Jacks of all trades" but "Masters of none". From all of the posts I have seen, the majority ask to, at higher levels, have the same control (or mastery, if you will) of their diversity of spells at lower levels. If that's too confusing, here's another way to put it:<P>When does the balance of power shift against druids? If it does at all, it seems the druid hoard wish to elimate this prospect entirely. I hardly think that is fair to ANY of the other classes out there...even clerics.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Anyhoo, thanks to all the druids out there who choose to post insightful, creative posts rather than the annoying dribble that has become associated with the class. Thanks also to the clerics out there who do the same. =)<P>-CTD<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

No one but yourself to be honest.  Use your diversity, compensate and play the game.  No one is forcing you to stop playing when someone leaves.  And by your response, IF the point is to allow druids/shamans to be almost as effective in healing as clerics, why do people bother playing a cleric?  Perhaps this is the reasoning as to why there are so few clerics around.<P>"When I form a group the FIRST class I want to join is a cleric. This WON'T change. But by improving druid/shaman healing at least I can STILL play if no cleric is around. PERIOD."<P>There is absolutely nothing from stoping you from playing when a cleric isn't there.  People have done it all the time in EQ.

Did you lose all your healing and regen abilities overnight ?  <P>I have yet to see one valid response as to why these classes believe they should heal almost as well as cleric.  All I see is twisting of words and mantras being chanted around.  This 'monopoly' I will say takes the cake.<P>I'm sure you'll complain with the same logic of the 'monopoly' that wizards have as the masters of DD.

</FONT><HR>I like the changes allowing Druids and Shamans to be more effective healers.<P>Interesting how spells that didnt even exist before Kunark are "Core" spells... I"d consider Complete healing, Res, and hp buffs "core" for clerics as no one does them as well.<P>And please stop whining about necro's getting res; they didnt ask for it, and it takes an essance emerald to cast which means someone gave up an unressable life for it..geez... <P>My question now is that since we finally have some classes that can substitute for Clerics when there arent any available, when will we have someone that can take an enchanters place effectively?  Only possibility i see right now is necromancers and their screaming terror spell has too short of a duration to handle multiple (3+)mobs EFFECTIVELY.<P>For all I care cleric's can have sow and teleports, they already go anonymous anyway  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056294-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056294.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056294-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056294-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056294&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056294&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
