</FONT><HR>Its complete BS to see guards get killed and the people killing them not help the newbies that need the help. All i hear is "I pay so i can do what i want." Well i pay also and when you were a newbie you have the advantage of having guards to protect you. Because your high level now you assume no one in the game needs the guards anymore and then dont even help the newbies out that need the guards. Well iam sick and tired of being killed because there are no guards and because the people killing them dont want to help out cause they would use mana to help me and make thier down time longer. I think Verent just needs to make guards not give exp anymore. I doubt anyone kills guards then. The only reason they camp guards is for exp, and it just makes it impossible for a newbie to get any help from a guard if there are never any there.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Please remember the premise of this game: it's an RPG.  In all honesty if I'm a Dark Elf SK, I'd kill the elf guards in Felwithe because I WANT TO.  This will make a newbies life difficult, but should I care?  I'm not there to make their life easier, I'm there to pay my respects to the inferior High Elves.<P>As a Paladin, it is my duty to rid FP of the corrupt and oppresive Freeport Militia.  Under that role I will feel compassion for the inhabitants (newbies) of Freeport.<P>Just assume everyone is roleplaying.  Sure it may not make your life easy.. but should it?  And if they disregard you, disregard them at a later date.  Maybe you're a low level cleric, and in their time of need you will not heal them?  Ever think of such a tactic?<P>As the saying goes, "All's fair in love and war".  We all have our opinions, but guard killing is something that should not be an issue.<P>P.S. I'll kill FP Militia anytime.  Wheter I get exp or not.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I understand the role playing aspects of guard killing and I approve of organized city-storming.  What I don't like is higher lvl players that kill the newbie guards and don't act as guards for them.  I think it is selfish and low.  I don't care if your character is to be that way.  I think that part of the game is about community and that you tear that down by not acting as guards.<P>I also think it is sad to see elves and other "good" races killing the guards in Butcher Block.  This is to be a Role Playing game, even a bit loosely.  And what about all those good races murdering gnome guards as well?  If you want to do that, then go play quake or something.  I think Verant should make guards give no exp.<P>-the Lynnx</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>My guild is anti-gaurd killing....well partially. For roleplaying purposes or quests its okay.  And dungeons arent that great.  Foe levels 10-25 there great.  Than theres fewer.  Soon your only options are l-guk,sol B, or the planes.  Guk , and Sol B are small zones packced to the rim.  6hours lists are out there, there not a phenomenon, there more common than ice in  antartica. And the planes...WOH! you have be 47 to get a group, and usually guilds dont want you to travel with them unless your 50. On top of that , its hard.  Anyways, Ak'anon is a dungeon...a fun one, with a king.  I wonder what he drops...well, I'll  kill the gaurds outside first Also, I kill gaurds for roleplaying purposes.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ok, it's an RPG... Then ROLE PLAY it... If you killed a guard in Freeport, it'll be a LONG time before you go back, for fear of being killed, hanged, mobbed, etc... You will want to lay low for a while until the heat dies down, not stick around town and wait... Plus, it doesn't sound like you have really thought about WHY you hate them, "I'm good, they're bad" makes an Ogre sound like a genius. <P>I have no problem with people who kill guards, or anything else for that matter, but, if they do it claiming "It's an RPG", then at least try to role play it..

</FONT><HR>I don't get all the hostility and "let them fend for themselves" toward newcomers. Everyone goes through that. I don't much like guard killing, but I really don't get not looting them. I also don't get not helping folks who are relying on the guards for protection. You want to roleplay that way, fine, but it's not karma that I would want. <P>That newbie you are making life hard for today may save your life one day. Or that of a friend. Or they may remember your name and just not help you when needed. <P>But aside from that, if you're going to take away a tool the people who are new to a zone need, then help them. And it's not a matter of taking on MoBs that are too tough for you. MoBs aggro. They con one way but are tougher than you thought. There's all kinds of things that can go wrong. <P>At least kill guards where they are not needed as much. How does that harm you? It doesn't, but killing guards elsewhere sure harms the enjoyment of the game by others. It may be RP, but that doesn't excuse you for being a jackass of a human. RP or not, you're still human and it wouldn't kill you to share a bit or to help others enjoy the game, too. That "it's RP" stuff is just lame. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>1. No, you don't have to kill guards to get exp. I'm 40+, and oddly, when I want to go get experience, I can, I never have to wait, and I don't have to kill guards. People kill guards because they're *safe* exp, and you don't need any social skills to do it, 'cause you don't need to group. <P>If you have to kill guards to get exp, you're too dumb to be playing this game anyway.. may I recommend tic tac toe?<P>a. no idea how to play their class in any kind of challenging situation. Getting to level 50 does not in and of itself make you good at the game. No-one who has mainly levelled on guards will get to do anything worthwhile with me.<P>b. an annoying habit of being selfish, greedy kids (whether over 18 or under 18 kinds of kids) and again, if I know you levelled on newbie guards, guess what the reply is when you ask for space in an event I'm organizing, or someone asks me "hey.. what do you think of so-and-so.. they applied for membership in our guild".<P>2. The guards were put there for a reason. Killing them defeats that reason. Blooeyblob's idiotic rambling illustrates the problem with that tho.. guard killers tend mostly to be social cripples with no ability to empathize with other people. When a newbie dies because of something you did, they experience frustration, disappointment, and they lose time. Of course, that doesn't matter to you, or you wouldn't be doing it, so please.. ask me for help sometime.<P><BR>poporules: Just because you're too stupid and/or chicken to be able to level without guard killing doesn't mean everyone else will. I'm sorry the game's a bit too hard for you.. may I suggest tic tac toe?<P>using RP for an excuse? Weak excuses to hide the fact that basically you're just the same as blooey and popo<P>Basically anything worth doing after 45 requires that you know your class inside and out in a group situation. Guard killers lack that, and thus are missing out on what the game's about. no doubt they'll say different, but hey... they thought killing the same easy mob over and over for days was worth paying $10 a month for, so you really think they're bright enough to know?<P>You're ***holes, you know it, we know it, and nothing you say, do, or cry about is going to make the slightest bit of difference to that basic truth.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>To be truthfull I don't see anything wrong with guard killing. For alot of people the dungeons like guk. sol b and kedge are full with huge lists so they kill guards.I don't kill guards often but have killed a few in my time. I have killed some ogre guards because I am a dwarf and anyone that has gone to cazic and had hurd kil them looks foreward to the day they can kill him and of course freeport guards because this is part of the paladin soulfire quest.I have played many newbs without guards to protect me and I have done fine without them. I have not gained much exp killing guards so you know this is not something i do often. This is just my opinion not to flame anyone <BR>My view is just plainly to each their own.<P>Safe journeys and be well my friends<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum22&number=22&thisthread=000128&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum22&number=22&thisthread=000128&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
