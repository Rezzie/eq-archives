</FONT><HR>Bravo Vendrix, you've hit the nail on the head.<P>My wife has a High Elf Paladin and once whilst on one of our many long slogs camping the FBSS I said to her. <P>"Why are there items in the game that increase a melees swing speed, but no items that increase the casting speed of spells for a caster. Or why aren't there items that allow us to use less mana when casting".<P>Just last night I was in hate watching a rogue deal out ludicrous amounts of damage (one rogue backstabbed for 496) while all my spells were either being resisted or resisted so much they were hit for 4.<P>Afangia<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well...<P>I play a Warrior, and while I don't have these same problems, I can easily see how much they are tearing my guildmates apart. <P>This post isn't in reference to those people who are still xp'ing. Nor is it in reference to those people who consider two dragons in one week to be a busy raiding schedule. <P>The simple fact is, we raid every day. A day off for us consists of hitting up the Plane of Growth. <P>In a typical day, we kill Klandicar, Zlandicar and head to Sleeper's Tomb. In a busy, busy day, we clear most or all of Veeshan's Peak.<P>To me, it is crystal clear who is contributing to the fight, and who is just there for so-so support roles. Necromancers are screwed. Sitting around feeding mana sucks. Mages are screwed. CoTH'ing everyone there, then just watching the fight, sucks. Usually you can't summon a pet, cause the mob's fear and pets bring back too many adds. <P>The role of casters is simply ridiculous in serious raiding guilds. Sure, we need the druids and wizards for rides, shaman for buffs, enchies for buffs. But there should be something more to add to a night's raiding then 15 minutes worth of set-up.<P>Arnwolf Magnuson<BR>Da`Kor<BR>59th Barbarian Warrior<BR>Erollisi Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I guess what casters want is:<P>1. A caster haste-like spell to reduce casting times (Absor already said this was out of the question).<P>2. Better items that actually give us better performance in battle and not 1 more point of INT or 10 more mana.<P>3. An increase of Mana thoughout the levels, moreso after level 50 than before. In otherwords, we need more mana per level. Something like 15-20% more.<P>4. A decrease in casting time per level on spells. Spells increase in damage per level now, but there is no reduction in mana usage or casting time. It would make sense for spells to either decrease the casting time or use less mana once a caster has mastered the spell.<P>5. Fizzle Rates. The fizzle rates after 50 are insane. Last night I was goofing around in Thurgadin with Abscond. I am a level 52 wizard and it's a level 52 spell. Granted, I had not "mastered" casting this spell yet, but I fizzled 8 times in a row, sucking all of my mana right out of me. So I harvested and tried again. Fizzled 5 times and finally just gave up. This is a problem. Fizzles should happen no more that 20% on a new spell. Hell, I fizzle alot on gate and thats a level 4 spell.<P>6. Focus items. Mages got some in the earlier levels, but there are NO UPGRADES, and there is nothing similar for other casters at all.<P>7. A lure type spell for each class. This makes alot of sense. If you want to balance classes, there should be no reason to choose a wizard for their lures over a Necro for their lifetaps.<P>8. More Group spells. The most useful spells most classes have are not Group casting. If you want to make casters more group friendly, give them spells that will lower downtime and are group friendly.<P>9. Caster disciplines? I've seen lots of players wondering why melee and Hybrids got these and casters didn't. Every time VI adds a new ability to a caster, it is almost always a spell. This makes no sense. Why don't casters get abilites? Oh, we get dodge, but we get nothing that says "Hey, this ability was designed with a caster in mind". It would make sense to let they Hybrids share some of these caster abilities eventually as well.<P>10. Another specialization after the first. I don't know how many times I wished that my evacs and gates were as mana efficent as my nukes. Perhaps letting us specialize in our secondary form of magic would help a bit.<P>Well, thats about it so far. I have a few other ideas for each class, but I won't bore you with things that wouldn't be looked at by a blue.   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>/cheers for Ven and Tuan<P>Great posts - although my cleric and casters aren't that high yet, the logic is inescapable. You would truly, truly have to be dead to the world not to see that.<P>A VI rep ( one of the A's) posted once that they and / or the dev team had chars of high levels, who played just as much as the player base does, who really understand the game dynamics and shortcomings...  You know what? I'd believe that as far as I could throw it, and halfling's can't throw that far. Show us some pics, make a slideshow movie, log on as your char and meet people, anything. It seems that you are so far out of touch that everything smells funny, you can't hear a thing, and the sun ain't shining where you are - get my drift?<P>/bump<P>Limpy  - Emarr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Say this question to yourself. Then echo it as far as it will carry.<BR> <BR>Monsters are magicproofed as a matter of course. Beyond even unmezzable and unstunnable. To the point where the ONLY spell that lands on it are Lures.<BR> <BR>Armored to the point where the only effective damage dealing are pure melee classes. Dealing out damage that only pure melee classes with uber disciplines can soak up,and even that only because of clerics that can cast spells that restore 100% of the target's HP.<BR> <BR>It is a system where post 50 the pure classes are increasingly the only solution,and post-Velious only the pure melee and cleric are truly needed.<BR> <BR>An quartet of six-man teams of wizards,shamans,druids,and enchanters could empty their mana bars into the mob. And even if it didn't hit ONE of them,the mob would survive due to it's resists and obscene HP. And that's assuming it sat there like a dumb rock. In fact,it wouldn't even suffer serious damage if it was 24 wizards Luring the thing full burn.<BR> <BR>And this is the norm? For epic mobs of all kinds and descriptions?<BR> <BR>Ask yourself why this is. Ask yourself why Verant isn't creating monsters that are meleeproofed the way they've made so many casterproof. Ask yourself why this has trickled down to even non-epic mobs in Velious.<BR> <BR>Ask yourself why your guild's enchanter won't go into Velious to cast on anything but his guildmembers. Ask the wizard how it feels. Ask the necro,the druid,the shaman. Ask the hybrids. Ask the ranger,the paladin,the shadowknight. Can you comfort them with saying that even though one of them taunts himself to rapid death and the other two can't hit anything,at least they got spells that won't stick to make up for their low melee skills?<BR> <BR>Ask yourself what kind of monsters would make these classes feel useful in combat again aside from buffing the meleers or healing them. Ask yourself why they don't exist. Ask yourself why your party never says "Thank goodness you could nuke it,I couldn't hit it and it was nuking me to pieces. And a good thing the hybrid could help keep it busy,too. If it didn't aggro on him,and he hadn't stunned it...".<BR> <BR>Then ask yourself why you aren't beating the door down to get these changes before your friends burn out and walk out in frustration.<BR> <BR>Ask these questions. Get them answered.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What I don't understand, is why VI keeps refusing to give casters some form of 'haste' (for lack of a better term).<P>We have an INT cap, a +mana cap, so why are we continually getting items that add +int and +mana? So I can have a change of clothes that does the same thing but with the stats switched around? Where is my uber gear, that makes me a BETTER CASTER? No such thing exists. I still cast the same, I still get resisted the same, I still have max mana...I never become a BETTER CASTER. I just have a few hundred extra mana, maybe. I get to cast one more (resisted) spell. Or twitch a cleric one more time. That's the BEST I can hope for out of any new gear. Then you hit the cap on your mana...and there are no improvements from then on, ever.<P>What would be SO imbalancing about getting BETTER at casting your spells as you increase in levels? Isn't it...*gasp* logical that you would?<P>I just don't understand. What would be the problem? The ONLY difference in me naked and me with my gear is my mana pool. And my mana pool is still too small...if I even have anything to do besides feed mana to the cleric.<P>I just want to be useful, and wanted.

</FONT><HR>Well, we all saw this coming didn't we?  I am actually quite surprised given Verant's actually quite good math background so far.  By allowing percentage based advancements to one side, the other, that grows linearly, is now suffering.<P>I said a while back (on the topic of caster two-handers actually) that we would need to see items that actually increased caster effectiveness.  Guess what?  Even if the int/wis cap was dropped it would mean almost nothing.  Mana pool is not the trouble.  Actually, mana regen is a key issue in an experience grouping, but even that is not the real issue.  <P>As melee ramps up in terms of actual power, both output and absorption, the encounters must be made harder to compensate.  So far, casters have received *nothing* to offset this.  Ok, perhaps nothing is strong.  Some of the high-end caster gear does have free casting effects but these are few and far between.  <P>Another way to look at this is through the economy.  A level 30 melee these days can be reliably expected to have gear that used to be reserved for the 40+ crowd.  This is trickle down and it makes them far more effective.  Level 30 casters may have old level 40+ caster gear now too but it doesn't have the same effect.  A 30 Wizard with 190 int is not that much better than a level 30 Wizard with 150 int.  It is a bigger pool but unless you are OOMing and remedding each fight, it is not useful.  The 30th Warrior with a Wurmslayer and Yak combo *is* doing a heck of a lot more damage than the fellow with a BIBS or something.  Perhaps that is just twinks but I do see much better equipment at the lower levels over all these days.<P>Hmm, I ramble and shouldn't.  The point is this:  I am very happy to see the tanks contributing damage.  I always thought they should.  I think they are now balanced in respect to pets at least.  I do think that upper 50s offensive casters (even Wizards, though less so) are getting a raw deal.  Their damage output has fallen sharply in relation to MOB power.  The resistance issues only compound this to inane proportions.  I do not support inflation of powers in general but feel that casters need either skills or equipment (or spells that are obtainable) to offset the present situation.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Preach it Vendrix.<P>From an enchanter view yes we are the gods of exp groups.  But at 60 go to SoV and become the buff b*cough*ch you made fun of the shaman for being... well guess what? at least they can heal.  <P>PoG is a new plane that is quite a bit like fear... except crowd control on even con mobs or yellow con mobs that was possible yet dificult in fear has been removed from the high end game.  So it becomes a series of FD pulls and a mix of harmony to get the essential single or even occasional double that will be rooted out of the fight(I laugh at me the uber crowd control class specialist with uber 650ish ac trying to root out the 200 dmg per hit dealing phat pog mobs, that I can't stun either because stun is nerfed on high level mobs so that even if it does land it wont stun them, because paladin's and other classes who have more ac aren't conditioned to crowd controlling).  And you better not do any dmg to the mob while rooting it out or it will summon you over and over for the ocasional smack down.  And that mob better be far enuff away so it can't cheal the mob you're fighting!<P>Why does every melee person I know no longer wears any hate/fear drops yet my best set of stat gear for my 60 enchanter is still Insidious?  Would it have killed you to make the manna robe good stats and a good effect?  Most of the Tanks are using one or two non expansion items while most of my items, that are the best item for that slot, are from pre-kunark zones.<P>Then in SoV you add in new armor and everyone gets excited... casters are going to have items that will help is the thought.  Then slowly the stats come out and the effects and guess what? except for the gloves and the robe my insidious still owns the new armor by quite a bit.  Examine the effects on gear from class to class.  The new enchanter pants cast clarity... wow... my rod of infinite thought from innoruuk casts clarty(and omg I loved it way back last year pre-kunark when clarity was the spell I used).  Now I never cast or would think of using clarity.  Mage robe effect is just silly... 20 second cast time for a 25 point dmg shield is plane and simply weak.<P>You know something is amiss when all caster robes become valued for simply their look/originallity.  The stats they give are meaningless for the most part.<P>Just a bit of support for Vendrix, he has taken a problem and posted it in a well thought message.<P>Yenom<BR>60th Enchanter<BR>Storm's Fury GL<BR>E-Marr the server of Luv (not just Cattie)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

At this point half the problem seems to be being useful on a raid, but half is even finding a raid willing to take you. I've seen lots of groups saying "need tank", "Need cleric"..I haven't seen anyone actually ask for a mage or druid since South Karana.  <P>My point being..items would make you usefull..if you had the items.  I think they should make the classes inherently more useful.  If you're planning a raid..would you even want 'A' necro, let alone the 7 of them who are sending you tells asking to come (would be 70 of them if it was a raid for the mystical uber item that made necros become useful to a raid.) <P>There is an inherent need for clerics on every raid.  An item or two would make it more interesting for them, since admittedly, it seems to have become one of the most boring jobs since elevator operator.  For most of the other classes, many raids can get by without them entirely, or even if there is a need for them, there rarely seems to be a need, or even a fathomable reason to bring 2.  <P>~A<BR>(why do I get the spooky feeling that they'll try to fix this by doing something incerdibly useless, like giving the casters riposte, or kick.)<P>PS.

</FONT><HR>I agree. The problem in part is due to Complete Healing being better each time your tank levels. That wouldn't matter if Verant hadn't kept putting better and better weapons out there though. Weapon damage gets better, Complete Healing is the only spell that gets significantly better. What you have is all you will ever have at 60. If what you have doesn't stick, you are in trouble. If what you have that does stick doesn't do the job, you are worthless. As healers, even a Druid and Shaman with Greater Healing is better than a Wizard for many of these fights it seems like. At least they are doing something (healing the Necromancers who are liching to feed the Clerics mana). Stuns don't work, nukes don't work, slows don't work, fears don't work, snares don't work, roots don't work...<BR>Everquest might have been better off leaving the levels capped at 50 and just giving some diversity within the existing framework. Anything more would require work which Verant wasn't putting in (they prefered working on the art and phat lewtz). At this point, nerfing Complete Healing wouldn't work. Verant would also have to nerf the weapons and rebalance the mobs. Can you see that happening? I can't. All I can think is to play lower level characters and simply not play casters since all the other low levels will have twink weaponry. That leaves the true newbies at a serious disadvantage. I guess I am starting to feel some sympathy for the newbie beggars that are upset that they don't have full quest armor and uber weapons, but have to compete with those that do. They aren't wanted in groups if that group can get an uber tank that rips mobs apart with little support needed.<P>What is the answer? I don't know. Verant has dug a hole for EverQuest (TM). Perhaps they should rebalance the entire game (including weapons and spells) to reestablish a playable system. It seems to me that Verant is trying to make winning impossible, and are frustrated by the players' skill at every turn. The result is that Verant has decided to cheat. If something wins fights, Verant nerfs it. Maybe not on that mob, but on the next ones they put in. Finally we have Velious. Tactics are too good? Let's just remove anything remotely like advanced tactics. How do we do that? Upgrade resists so that tactics are unreliable at best, impossible on average. I don't call summoning pets and saying "/pet attack" tactics. I don't call targeting the mob and hitting "attack" tactics. I don't call mobs unaffected by your spells something that you can kill with tactics. If you could record macros for EQ, I imagine a lot of people would go AFK during epic fights. They don't need to do anything except point their character at the mob and pound the same keys repeatedly until dead. That isn't tactics. That is something to do while you are chatting with your friends. To be very honest, that is all online role playing games are. Something to do while chatting with your friends. The problem is we are often not grouping with our friends now as they feel useless in our groups, or are actually a detriment due to increased lag issues. I play a Cleric, but have Druid, Wizard and Ranger friends. What do they have to contribute to these top of the line fights?<P>What do I expect Verant to get out of this post? Nerf Complete Healing. Not what I am saying at all. Complete Healing was rarely used on tanks up to about level 45 pre-Kunark just because they didn't have the hit points to justify it. Better to say look at the pre-Kunark game and make the post-Velious game more like it. There are quite a few things to nerf that would improve the game. The problem is that item patches leave the servers down a very long time. Nerfing all the items would take days I would think.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

One HUGE change to one side effects another. It is a never ending cycle. <P>In my eyes EQ has passed a boundery I have also been against in any RPG that I play. The equipment makes the character. This is a no no in my eyes. You do not give out equipment that makes x character 70% more effective than y character. That is just a bad thing to do. Plus, in the world of class balance, it becomes to be too large of a variable to the class. (eg, since a warrior with a YAK and Wyrmslayer is 50% more effective than a wizard at 30th level, do you Nerf the warrior's attack skill? Then this makes another warrior who wields a PGT and Langseax 70% less effective against that same Wizard but the YAK/Wyrmsalyer wielding warrior is just about right)<P>Enough rambling, again...

</FONT><HR>Agreed more or less completely.  What we have here is a problem shared by a lot of classes, but while hybrids and monks are feeling a pinch casters are being completely destroyed.  The high level game is ruled by warriors, rogues and clerics, and to a much lesser degree enchanters.  The way to fix this problem is with a combination of no drop spells found in high level zones, as suggested by Vendrix, and by high level items that give more than +50 mana.  Casters improve when they cast higher quality spells, and when they cast more spells.  Until they get that, any solution to their problems will be stopgap at best.<P>Master Arikel Callistrae<BR>Erollisi Marr Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>The problem as I see it was the level expansion was handled a bit improperly from the beginning since casters never were allowed very much power, mostly because they had been so fearsome pre-RoK.<P>So tanks and casters all get some gain in power in the form of skill upgrades for tanks and new about comparably powerful spells for casters (say increase tanking ability by 20% for melee via skills, and about 20% increase in spell power for caster).<P>Yet difference between a lvl 50 warrior pre-RoK and your average lvl 60 warrior when SoV came out is a LOT more than those skills.<P>Most of our melee were making due with bloodfires and not nearly all had dragon haste yet (thx bad luck with that). So we're looking at 10/21 if I remember correctly and18% haste. On level 60 pre-SoV we're looking at 14/23 or 10/19 VP weaps with 33% haste on the same people. Anyone want to print out how much difference in damage output this does? And now that this was obviously not enough, melee has gone to 14/20 and 40%+ haste from Velious.<P>What have the casters gained from equipment during this time where melee more than doubled (a rough estimate but I'm pretty sure on it) their damage output with new equipment? I know extremely well equipped people so SURELY they must have gained lots:<BR>Cleric: well my ac is really through the roof my, wandering when I'll go over 1100ac self buffed (real close now). Not that this helps me all that much since only times I get hit is when I'm bored and pulling in PoG or some other easy place. I guess I have more mana now as well, but only time when I'm really looking at mana is at Hoshkar when I'm doing Words of Restoration, since in Velious my mana regen is 100 times more important than manamax anyway. Only item that actually enhances my power as a cleric now that the Donals nerf is coming, is my PoG BP. Yeah I can own lower level camps with this thing, no doubt about that... It isn't that useful with high end mobs though, but I guess that means Verant might not actually nerf it.<BR>Enchanter: frankly I have yet to see them gain anything from their equipment. They had something like 590ac 202int 195cha pre-RoK, then 670ac 215int 220cha pre-SoV and now something like 730ac 215int 240cha. Some lame dot effect on their VP robe and LONG casting time rune which requires a component on the PoG robe. I'm not an enchanter so dunno if they're really thrilled about this improvement, but I sure as hell wouldn't. Oh yea they have +hp gear too!<BR>Wizard: Pretty much same as enchanters except that wizards go for +mana/hp. Wizard robes/staff actually have a shot at being useful though, just ruined by their too long casting times.<BR>Magician: Epic is good. None of their nukes will land anyway though so getting those as effects isn't very useful.<BR>Necromancer: YAY! Summon corpse on a robe... that must be SO cool. The thrill of adventure. Just think of yourself doing a trailer for everquest, how would you advertise the necro class at lvl 60?<BR>Druid: they've gotten some ac as well, though nothing comparable to clerics. No significant effects though.<BR>Shaman: same here basically.<P>-----------------------------------------------<BR>------ IDEA HERE, worthwhile read part  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> -----<BR>-----------------------------------------------<P>I think Verant has a coding problem possibly with the spell haste items or they would have done it a long time ago. However they could get around these easy enough and have us actually happier with less actual power increase.<P>NO DROP spells from the very highest end monsters. Highest end means VP, Zlandicar, Dain, Yelinak, Sleepers Tomb, Tunare, Tormax, Avatar of War, Statue of Rallos Zek etc. This means they would probably never get farmed so you wouldn't risk this sort of power in the hands of twinks or whatever. Make the spells lvl 60 as well, and need I remind you to make them _NO DROP_ again?<P>Just put them in the loot tables so that you have 1 spell dropping off each kill, maybe 2. What kind of spells would we be expecting here? Spells that would actually help in these high end encounters, maybe some huge spells of convenience (something I think the killers of these mobs deserve). There is no reason not to make these spells very powerful either, since they still won't approach melee power, and I can pretty much guarantee people doing these mobs do NOT farm stuff for ebay or take over newbie camps.<BR>A few suggestions:<P>Shaman: unresistable attack speed debuff (-20%) This wouldn't really make the encounters trivial, far from it, but it'd reduce casualties a bit most likely. Notice that you're already giving melee like 20%+ melee power increases from the same mobs. AoE riotous health costing a lot of mana would be pretty nice as well if you would be able to code it (aoe annul and dots can be, so I don't see why you couldn't).<BR>Druid: all the wizard high end lures. Yeah suck it up these druids would be godly in many places of Kunark.. if they can kill the mobs targeted here the odds are their guilds already are gods in Kunark so who cares? Also the heals that were planned.<BR>Cleric: 8sec casting time CH, 2.0 casting time 1500hp heal for 500mana, immediate effect.<BR>Wizard: unresistable 1000 damage for 400 mana. Yeah you heard me, unresistable.. not lure, but UNRESISTABLE. Have this drop only from big Velious mobs or Phara/Hoshkar in VP, it might be imbalancing VP if it dropped from Silverwimp or Xygoz.<BR>Enchanter: Unresistable 20sec mez costing 600 mana. Caps at lvl 64 though. I can't think of any situation where this would be really out of tune, since most of the named mobs are 65+ anyway and I don't see any situation where it makes sense not to be able to mezmerize the target. <BR>Necromancer: Buff to make pets resistant to fear, comparable to what mages are getting. A version of lifetap that is unresistable, also a version of EB that is totally unresistable.<P>Obviously any of these spells given to someone that hasn't even given Trakanon yet would be really overpowered, but looking at the mobs I listed as ones dropping them, I really don't see a problem. Also would make VP a more interesting target even with ST dropping superior loot in most ways.

</FONT><HR>I would like to introduce a very simple concept to those of you who are whining that the game was never balanced to begin with, and how now shifted to the other side.  Specifically, melee's were outclassed pre-kunark, and now casters are out classed.  <BR>In an effort to explain this succintly I will use a big word that I know many of you 7th graders will not understand.  That is "inversly proportionate"  This means if one side of something is low, you make the other side high.  In this way creating a balance amongst the classes.  <BR>Damage vs Ability to take damage is an inversly proportionate relationship.  Pre-Kunark and SoV melees were upset that casters could out damage them.  Casters have fewer HP (take less damage) so could deal more damage than the melee.  Melee's have more HP than casters and could deal less damage.  Balance.  Melee may not like, it but I could care less.  Very simple theory. <BR>Now, take the warrior with haste items, and 4k hp who is now doing 4x the damage of a caster.  ON ANY MOBS!!!  This is a directly proportionate relationship.  In boo-boo bear speak (lol I loved that btw... soo funny) if one side of something is high, then so is the other side.  Whereas the caster, still having few hp, is regaled to doing as much, if not a little less damage (in hopes of conserving mana and participating in all kills, and not mana burning himself into med time).<BR>This is where the class balance was lost.  This is not rocket science people.  Completely independent of the fact that some mobs are MR the imbalance exists.  This is basic fundamental math that can be taught to all boo boo bears.  The MR of mobs only further skews the equation.  <BR>And the relationship between mobs to players, should be directly proportionate.  Which it is.  But instead of it being a mob at lvl 45 is 1.2 times stronger than a player of the same level, we now how have mobs that are hundreds of times more powerful than players of equivalent level.  Directly proportionate, but not 1 to 1.2 instead 1 to 100+.  Rediculous.  Melees were scaled to this much better than were casters.  And the way to overcome is to simply attack en mass.  In melee mass.  Let the casters buff, and help with the CR.<BR>A wonderful thread.  I am glad to see it brought up and hope that it is repeated until the powers that be have completed their basic junior high math studies.  Verant, proportionate increases.  Two words, please wrap your minds around this simple simple theory.  If a melee is now able to do 4x more damage than the casters, than you need to make casters do 5 or 6x more damage.  Or give us equivalent HP and damage.  Which isn't at all what any of us want.  So your choice is clear.  To almost any 7th grader.<P>Rialto Spellweaver<BR>54th Season Wizard (gathering dust as I play my chanter)<BR>Knights Of Force<BR>Veeshan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wow 4 pages nice, but I dont do damage anymore my only job now is to slow the mobs down but I have no way to reduce the MR of a mob. Malio never lands on them now.<P>I am just a poor mans cleric, what I am do do now? I can not tranfer mana I can do some light healing so I have NO active roll anymore becouse of the MR of the mobs.<P>My 2k dots are not dropping in the game, I here more and more how there is only like 10 of both on most servers, hate to try to find out how many are on my server. My pet dies so fast its paper mecha(sp?) all I can do is buff the warrios ac a little more give him a little more HP.<P>May spells dont land, so I am not healing by slowing and IF I did have my dots lets do 6k in 2mins woohoo one spell twice and the other one once in 2 mins wow now that is if thy land. It more then likly I can get one to land, I have an unresistable disease debuffer but I have had mob resist my disease even after this debuffing!!! <P>Please Make Slow a Disease base resisted spell and Malio a disease base resist as well it would let the shaman class be a very welcomed class again.

</FONT><HR>*Bump* You are 100% correct Vendrix, hit the nail right on the head. I sit on the same short-bus as all the other non-wizard casters.<P> I can contribute absolutely nothing to epic fights and high level encounters at level 60. I started my druid in june 1999 and after 1 year and 7 months of hard work get absolutely nothing for my effort.<BR>I teleport my guild to the raid, that is all I have to contribute as a druid. I dont have any lure spells, even if I had I would(just as Vendrix mentioned above) I would only contribute a drop of water in an ocean of damage compared to a rogue.<P> Everything I fight on a normal day basis are 100% druid, necro, mage, shaman resistant. What I have left is my level 30 pet and my scimitar. Druid pet is out of the question, since its low level would only be feared and train our guild. I can not use my buffs because cleric/shaman buffs are still 200% better and does not stack.So I am left with my scimitar, I tickle Zlandicar for 10 damage. Druid heals are a joke in a epic fight. 5 out of 10 heals fizzle because of the cap of alteration anyways. Druids are nukers that has some healing abilities.<P> I would understand that if 1 or 2 mobs were 100% magic resistant in the game THAT would be interesting and challanging, but a majority of the dragons and super mobs in SoV are 100% magic resistant. So I have to go and put a cone on my head and sit in the corner with all the other retarded spell casters that can contribute nothing and watch the warriors,rogues, monks and cleric kill the dragons and super mobs. <BR>Enough said, great post Vendrix!<P>Wheat Ironwolf <BR>Level 60 druid Da`Kor</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It would have been interesting to have some mobs that are immune to melee damage but susceptible to magic damage.

</FONT><HR>Obviously Verant could simply strip certain resists from some mobs to make casters feel a lot more useful, even when giving away the spells I suggested. I don't really understand why should the dragon that lives in a lair of ice be totally immune to fire. Ie set Yelinaks fire resist to -255 and see what kind of drastic difference this would make on raids.<P>For our Yelinak raids this would mean that the one lvl 60 druid we have would do up to 15k damage (gosh half a rogue, thats pretty good) assuming she wouldn't get killed. Also the one mage we have along would do pretty comparable damage. Wizards might do truly massive damage, maybe even up to 20k. Certainly this all piles up, but notice nobody is reaching the damage that is done by the rogues, and this all is assuming the casters would NEVER get agro from Yelinak, which is highly unlikely.<P>-- Delheru Tanreall<BR>Avatars of Discord, Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Some very valid points here. Really high resists should be an exception rather than a rule. <P>Melee classes rely on their equipment. Whereas casters should rely on their spells. But Adding items reducing casting time sounds fair really. I guess they are too scared of having the mana stone phenomena happening again to make some big changes.<P>How about some disciplines<BR>enlarge: Makes spell effect 50% stronger<BR>channel: Mana usage is lowered 30%<BR>focus: Spells cast will have a reduced chance of being resisted.<P>Yes the game is unbalanced. But it's just not melees being too powerful. In fact an untwinked melee is suffering hard in the 30-50 range, coz if you dont get a cleric you are on your own, you're just a burden without proper healing.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057442-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057442.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057442-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057442-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057442-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057442-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057442&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057442&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
