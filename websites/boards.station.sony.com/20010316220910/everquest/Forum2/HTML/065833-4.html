</FONT><HR>Very seldom to I find in necessary to flame anyone. It really is pointless, but, well, this is a special lil note to Veldra-FOH and his/her lil buddies-in response to what amounts of a laughable patronizing post. Ya have to laugh here.<P>&lt;&lt;I'm going to make this as simple as possible for you to understand.&gt;&gt;<P>I want to thank you for making your tactical information simple for a this former US Marine Platoon commander to understand. I am really in awe of your brilliance in this area. Thank you again. <P>&lt;&lt;sinking in yet?&gt;&gt;<P>I guess so, as I am laughing my butt off. <BR>Look, if you and your lil friends want to believe that you have any concept of tactics or logistics, then that is fine. No problem. If you choose to wear your lil FOH on your sleeve as if it means something, then that is ok too. I promise not to laugh. <P>But, if you are going to attempt to patronize the rest of us as you attempted, then don't do that. K?  You know squat about tactics or logistics. What you call "epic", and "tactical" I call hilarious. <P>These encounters you pride yourself so valiantly on are a joke, they are simplistic in nature, and only require a mob (meaning mass of sacrificial lambs, and the ungodly time it takes to level this mindless mob), to complete. That is the issue, not tactics. You figure out what the program is doing, and you counter it. If you cant do it with 10, you use 30. You learn it, then reapeat until you get it down to the least amount of people to do it. There are no variables, no counter offensives, no flanking movements.  One could train monkies to do it what you do. In fact, the six man group dungeon crawl is actually more of a challange. <P>For the record, five old ladies with proper fields of fire would chop your entire guild down in about 8 seconds for goodness sakes.  At least Miir, and others of your guild have the good sense to approach it with this understanding in mind. Get over yourself,  It's a game. <P><BR>...And, simply because there is an overwhelming percentage of people who see this as a game and nothing more is no reason for you to feel your are better in any way. To us it is a game, nothing more. We take no pride in it, it does not raise us to and Epic level. We do that in real life. <P>Because of this, we do not have the time, nor do we want to waste the time it takes to ascend (or delv down) to the "epic" level. If you want to, then fine. I wont make fun of you for that. <P>The original post holds a ton of merrit. Period. What we would like is an entertaining, and doable for our commitment, game. We do not feel that it should be tuned to protect your minimal attention span, but that both games can, and should exist in harmony. <P>We play for fun, not status. <P>Have a nice day  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It seems that problems/complaints differ server to server, but some seem problems seem to be common amongst them all.  <BR>Fact:  Uber guilds will always be able to achieve Uber loots.  <BR>Catch: You have to be in one of these Uber guild to get some.<BR>This includes being able to raid in certain zones like Veeshan, Icewell, you get my point.<BR>Now I accepted the fact that I may not be able to get some uber loot and even make it to these zones, even though I do have 50+ chars..but do not belong in any Uber guild.  BUT, I also think that many Uber guilds have become too powerful with attitudes.  (I'm not saying all Uber guilds are like this cause I know some that are not.)  I do know that I see many players in some of the Uber guilds Farming items in areas that should be for lvl 30-50.  My characters that I have in this range don't have a shot to some of the loot in these zones when a lvl 60 is farming Frenzy in Lguk for example and the Lvl 60 is there just to twink his/her alts.  Another example, I've seen members of Uber guilds kill named mobs for items that were no drop and that they were wearing better equipment at the time.  (Full planes gear with epic).  What is the point here?  An example happened of this happened in Trak's Teeth.  Our group was killing the Forager to make the named mobs spawn.  One spawned so our ranger tracked and tried to pull.  Meanwhile, a ranger from an Uber guild tracked and tried to pull it.  He had full planes with epic...had thought we KS'd him, when it was him that tried to KS us, but even so...he said he didn't even need it.  So why the fuss?  He also said that his guild would be informed of the incident.  (Blacklist type thing to prevent us from either getting in this Uber guild)  Anyways, why kill a mob that has an item that lower levels are there camping for when you have better?  <BR>Btw, I read some posts about many people who play like 24/7, with money...try this on for size.  I know a player who had his accoun t banned, but his father was a lawyer and sent Verant a letter and had his account restored.  He is know the Guild Leader of one of the Uber Guilds.  Also, there are verant employees that DO have characters in Uber Guilds.  Any response to that Verant?  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan that was one of the most rude and inconsiderate postings of the official everquest staff I have seen in a while.<P>You are free to argue points against a players believe but you should stay away from mocking ridicule.<P>This particular player felt that the requirements to get into some of the highest level zones some players abilities.  He states they require guild like organization for entry.  And for some people this is true.<P>And I do agree with his notion that verant is focusing far to much on the post 50 player.  While they are in need of new content to keep the game interesting... so are the lower level players.  And largely this is due to the lack of quests.<P>There was a big talk about retuning under utilitized low level zones.  And thus far all that has been done is increased exp in these zones.  And they are still nearly empty.<P>Here are some problems the developers have ignored for lower levels.<BR>- The balance of power between classes taking into account the player sold goods available.<BR>- Underutilized zones and perhaps the problem that the items dropped are no longer useful (hence why nobody goes there)<BR>- Quest rewards.  A rusty weapon and a few copper should no longer be the norm for rewards... even if it is a level 15 quest.<P><BR>Some examples:<BR>A wurmslayer costs around 10-15k on the open market.  While this seems like alot it is obtainable by level 20 with no help from other players (although it would take several months).  The point is a wurmslayer in the hands of a Paladin, Ranger, Shadow Knight, or Warrior is a very dangerous item for the balance of other melee classes (rogue/monk) who have very few options to up their damage at lower levels.  Look at how many players have this item for lower levels.<P>Dungeons such as befallen have nothing to offer people.  First of all if you haven't been there here is a brief description.  3 floors, 1st of which has 4-6 skeletons and a shadowknight which is tough for a 10 (given he has harm touch) which has a key to the 2nd floor.  On the 2nd floor there are two keys, level 8-14 undead and the introduction of more common necromancer npc's.  The key to the 3rd floor is no rent meaning everytime you come here, you have to camp for it (or the one on the 3rd floor).  On the 3rd floor there are 14-20 undead/wisps/necromancers and a few campable NPC's.  Loot consists of bronze weaponry, a few robes and a decent 2 hander.<P>My suggestion is to completely upgrade the npc's in this dungeon 20 on the first floor, 25 on the 2nd and 30 on the 3rd floor.  Make the 3 keys rentable.  And add in a few level 30 drop, and random spawning npcs (just remember to move the thex mallet quest higher in the dungeon).  It is useless to have a dungeon with 10 level 6-7, 40 level 8-14, and 20 14-20 spawns.  Specially when there is no loot, and dying means an endless plee with players to get your corpse back.<P>Quests.  Alot of them give equipment which is useless given the market of sold goods by players.  And although you'd like to think that players do quests for the questing, it is also for the item received.  I have no time suggesting you take look at a spoiler website http://eqdb.allakhazam.com.  The interesting part of the sight is the Rating column.  Although I have never looked up how to accomplish the quest here is an example:<P>Dragonhide Belt 6 ac 10 sta: For Warr Rogu Monk Bard Shad Pala Cler Drui Sham Rang: Level requirements 50-60.  Rating Disappointing.<P>Why such a negative rating?<BR>-Thick Banded Belt  AC: +8 Str: +15  Far more useful to any melee (and I have yet to see a melee that would turn down strength)<BR>-Flowing Black Silk Sash: Effect Haste<BR>-Reed Belt  +6 AC +5 Wis +10 HP  Far more useful to a druid/shaman.  And if they have 200 wisdom I doubt they will be going after stamina.<P>In any case read some of the ratings with a grain of salt and try to figure out why players view things as they do, not all ratings are correct... but alot are.<BR> <BR>With limited banking slots available I am forced to pick my quests so I can actually keep the rewards.  For me this means the item has to be useful.  Another option would be a "quest list" viewable on a player to see what quests that player has accomplished.  It tells you alot about a player if you find out they volunteered the information that they did the crushbone belt quest 125 times.<P>Goodluck and refrain from the insulting commentary.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>That stuff is there so that, in 3 months, there aren't a huge pile of people demanding to know where the challenge is.<P>There are 9 zones in Antonica and Kunark that I have never set foot in with any character.<P>There are 4 zones that I have only seen because I created a newbie just for the purpose of looking at them, who I promptly deleted.<P>There are 5 zones that I have never done anything in of any sort other than travel through them.<P>There are 17 zones where I have done something other than travel, but this has been for less than 4 hours.<P>Do I complain about this "useless" content?<P>There are 101 zones in the game.  There are an average of perhaps 2500 players on at peak time; that's 25 per zone.<P>When I see an "uber" guild in one of the harder zones, it makes me happy.  Why?  Because they're not cluttering up the zone I'm in!<P>And the fact that many of these zones are currently underutilized is not a waste of resources; it is actually Verant planning ahead.  This gives us all stuff to do in 2 months, or 6 months, or a year.<P>On my server, there are perhaps 50 players who are members of a guild that is able to go pretty much anywhere it wants.  But there are about 300 players who are members of the 5 biggest "uber" guilds, capable of all of Kunark except perhaps VP, and much of Velious.  They probably hold about 450 accounts.  That's more like 9% of the total accounts, not 2%.  And as each week passes, more guilds, with more members, become capable of doing more of these things.<P>I don't see why building content in advance of need is a bad thing.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have a friend who's been playing for 2 years. She plays a SLEW of characters, and is a "casual" player. None of her characters has ever broken level 20 yet.<P>To her, places like Hate and Fear will ALWAYS be "inaccessible". But I'm glad Verant did them. In fact, I remember some complaints around 18 months ago when Fear had the minimum level limit put on it - people complained bitterly that said that it was Verant catering exclusively to the uber-guilds, making zones only useful to 1% of the population. After all, at the time, the majority of the players were in the mid-20's to mid-30's level range.<P>At one point it seemed like I'd never get there myself (the planes). But I did, eventually. Fortunately for me, by the time I got there, the planes were no longer "Uber-guild only". You could sign up for raids on public boards.

</FONT><HR>Excellent post, BowHawkin.<P>I don't think that ANY non-Uber player (by Uber I mean, their playstyle allows for fairly regular "Uber encounters" that require 24-40ppl and 6-8 hours at a sitting) would demand that all "Uber" content be stricken from the game, OR that no more should be coded.<P>That's not the point, really.<P>The point is that 90%+ of the EQ player base is non-Uber.  They are willing to invest 2-3 hours of playtime and form groups of 6 players (which is really just about all you can do in 2-3 hrs, and get anything else done).<P>The point is, the main thrust of ALL CONTENT of the game should be DESIGNED around the 6-person group with 2-3 hours to commit.  Essentially, everything that matters or is necessary to questing or equipping a character or to do trade skills should be regulated to that which the target demographic can achieve.<P>UBER encounters should only be an attempt to satisfy a FRINGE portion of the clientelle base (as is providing soloable content).  Uber encounters should drop **more** content; however, to allow it to drop **exclusive** content is pandering to the minority fringe group, and alienating and frustrating your main customer base.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>MrMaeldavin said:<BR>*********At one point it seemed like I'd never get there myself (the planes). But I did, eventually. Fortunately for me, by the time I got there, the planes were no longer "Uber-guild only". You could sign up for raids on public boards.

Yes, anyone can do this, if they so choose.  Perhaps they will find a raid leader that will look beyond 2nd rate gear (no real time to invest in Uber-camps) or lack of any repuation amongst the Uber-elite.  It can happen.<P>But the fact is, 90% of the EQ customer base has NO intention of making Uber-raiding a regular part of their playstyle.  Uber-raiding HAS to be a regular part of your playstyle in order to even have the slimmest margin of chance that you'll be able to obtain content that randomly and rarely drops from those encounters ... and ONLY those encounters.<P>This doesn't "ruin" the game for me; nor does it make the game ANY less enjoyable.  My point here is that the game "shouldn't" be designed that way at all.  It is only LOGICAL, good sense that, if 90% of your player base plays a certain way, you don't code most of the very best content in a way that they have virtually **no** chance to obtain it.  AND you don't code it in a way that offers a very small group, by virtue of THEIR gaming habits, a far greater opportunity to experience it.  It's illogical, makes for bad customer satisfaction, and is, essentially, pandering to a special interest group.<P><BR>***********HOW is this different from places like VP or Sleepers?

There's still lots of content left to explore. ****************<P>It isn't any different.  It still takes an Uber-raid to accomplish any of these things.  And an Uber-playstyle for an individual to have any reasonable chance of actually obtaining content from such raids.<P>The fact that there is plenty to "do" in EQ isn't relevant to the issue.  The issue is, why does EQ pander to the Uber elite, creating content which they, and ONLY they, can obtain, to the general exclusion of 90% of their clientelle?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I just HAD to post about the comment Absor made about Misty Thicket being one of the *best* zones in the game.  <P>Do you HONESTLY believe that is what the player meant when he said best?  If so, please, for your own sake, think a little more before posting.  Best zones in the game are zones that drop the best loot, have the coolest looking monsters, and are the most fun to explore.  Misty Thicket?  You almost make me want to quit the game with comments like this.  <P>I agree with the original post.  I DO NOT play this game to kill drolvarg sentries in KC for fun.  An RPG is all about building your character and killing the boss mobs of the game.  That is the end game for EQ.  Doing the biggest and baddest mobs in the game.  If you can't get into an uber guild or make your own somehow, it won't happen.  *Most* of us DO NOT have the time to get an guild going like that and so we just have to accept the fact we won't see these places.  What fun would Diablo be if you knew you were never going to be able to face him and have a chance at killing him?<P>You are right, its a small percent of EQ that is big and bad.  BUT, that makes it the most fun and most challenging.  Didn't you put those zones in the game to give the players ooooos  and ahhhhs?  Ok, happy to know that not many people will actually be able to see them?

To do so would be virtual suicide for the game company. Tuning encounters to lame duck groups ends up with the econuters becoming trivialized and then guess what? Yep, use that 'Logic and Critical Thinking' class you just took, they have to upgrade the mobs AGAIN.<P>As far as the first Vox, you know nothing about the encounter, except what information I supplied. The Lady was later updated to actually DROP loot. Her AOE was downgraded considerably and her melee upped by 45 pts. But since I'm on the subject, this Vox issue is a perfect example to help further solidfy cold hard facts. Do you know why level limitations were placed on Vox and Nagafen? I rest my case.<P>I can draw a truth table for you if you like...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&lt;q&gt;--Western Wastes.. Aside from a few 'boss dragons', 15-24 people are ideal for these encounters.&lt;/q&gt;<P>____*If* you have a 57 Wizard/Druid to get through Siren's. Soemtimes, we don't as we only have 1! Remember in 10 to 18 people you don't get a guarantee of specific classes.________<P>Yeah, it probably didnt help that you've maligned every player of those two classes as idiots, morons, or worse for the last two years either.  How's that Druid mule coming along?  =p<P>____Here's just one example - the Frenzied Ghoul/FBSS camp. This is *exactly* the type of encounter you describe. It can be a challenge to a group at level 40, trivial for a group at 50 and solo farmed by the right class and at 60 it would just be a farm for any solo.<BR>___<BR>But that *isn't* what happened. The elite *moved on*. Its fairly easy to get that spawn completely uncamped and for the low end of the Bell Curve, people who play a couple of hours a couple of days a week, they can get their challenging, L40 group encounter - their own "uber mob".<BR>___<BR>The same exact process was happening with the Planes of Hate and Fear before the Epic Quest requirements were (idiotically) added. The elite had left these zones long behind and a challenge could be found for smaller guilds and more casual players.________  (Sorry for the big quote.)<P>Well, this is the first rational thing you've said.  I completely agree here.  The beauty of being 51 right now is that most of the power curve is way ahead at 55-60 and I have been able to get on tons of old continent dragon raids lately.  Having some place for the ubers to move on to was the best thing that ever happened to my guild, as we TRULY are casual players.  <P>The uber weapon quest drops in the planes justs sucks.  Fighting off uber guilds who have killed Cazic 100 times already so we can get our first shot just plain sucks.  But we suck it up and deal with it.  It's gonna get worse too when the redesign happens, I cant help but think that will make us fight for spawns even more.<P>When we're 55-60, will we have the same opportunity to do 'epic' scale encounters?  I dont know, but I know I'd rather work at accomplishing the same thing thoser that came before me did, rather than a watered down version of it.  <BR>Unfortunatly, when the 'elites' move from the dains and tormaxes of the game, you'll still be unable to do them because of your limitation of scale.  One of the simple truths of EQ is that cooperation will get you far, if you can act as an adult.  From what you've said in the past either your playstyle or your ego wont allow you to expand your horizons past your core group of 15 players, and the simple truth of the matter is that that is too few to do these so called epic encounters.  <P>Rather than asking Verant to cheapen the game, expand your horizons, and your /friends list.  Work with people rather than putting them down.  So what if you cant do an epic encounter 'in house'?  Isnt it better to be part of a team that does it than not at all?<P>Kad</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I'll use your above example to demonstrate why.<P>In this cooking magazine, recipes are presented that rely upon actual, real life limitations.  If a certain dish takes 14 hours to prepare, there's nothing that can be done about it.  It takes 14 hours to prepare.  Let's say most amateur chefs don't want to commit that much time to preparing a meal.  So it is put in the "Professional Chef" section of the magazine.<P>No amateur chef is going to complain that the dish takes so long to prepare .. because they know that it simply takes that long to prepare.

They reward this playstyle with exclusive content arbitrarily.<P>Larger investments of time in EQ should only result in greater QUANTITIES of content .. not in EXCLUSIVE content.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Mr. VanCouvering's evasions continue to be transparent, and are rapidly becoming tiresome.<P>Could my (non-munchkin) guild hook up with similar folks and raid a high-level area?  I suppose we could try; even as I speak such an effort is underway to raid the royals in Chardok.  My guild leader is of the opinion that the two guilds do not have the personell for a successful raid; given what I have heard of the area I am inclined to agree.  But plans are being made in any case.<P>It will take days at a minimum, if not weeks, to get the people we need (more properly, the people we can try to use in place of the people we need...) on board, and to have them clear the considerable amount of time it will take to actually participate in the raid.  (The average person does not have 6-8 hours of uninterrupted leisure time without specifically arranging for it.)<P>When we get there, it is 90% likely that one of the following will happen:<P>a) a_munchkin_guild00 will already be there trashing the place,<P>b) due to server resets or whatnot the mobs in question will have spawned earlier than anticipated and said munchkins will have already trashed the place, because they can be there in 20 minutes,<P>c) for whatever reason, the mobs will not have spawned yet.<P>The issue is not one of player skill.  This particular case does have character level issues but that's certainly not true in the general case.  My guild recently raided Hate with about half a dozen invites and completely trashed the place (no Innoruuk but that's not really an issue).  <P>The issue is simply that getting that many PCs in the same place at the same time is problematic for the vast majority of the players, and that making such a herculean effort is often unrewarding because of the game's limits on spawn times.<P>Munchkin guilds overcome this issue by having a substantial number of members with no real lives (usually high school students, or college students in the midst of flunking out, which is a time-honored mud tradition) coupled with PLed shared accounts (in violation of the EULA), so that teleporting classes are always available to move personell around and raid-critical classes (Clerics, Enchanters, etc.) are always available.<P>Mr. VanCouvering's response, that it is our choice whether or not to meet such requirements, is facile.  It was Verant's choice in the first place to design the game to require that manner of play.<P>As to the specific issue of Velious, I have to wonder how many people would have bought the product if they had known that half the continent was off-limits to anyone not in a munchkin guild.  Coupled with the overwhelmingly poor design of the continent (the entire continent is a classic example of railroading), I have to wonder how many people are going to think twice before paying for another expansion, too.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Isn't a lot of this so-called controversy tied up in what one considers a "raid" zone versus an "experience" zone?  I'm seeing a lot of posts in here dismissing zones where I regularly experience as "raid" zones.  Maybe it has something to do with thinking "outside the box?"  Just because a zone doesn't have 65 people in it, and every corner of it "camped" in reply to a "campcheck," doesn't make it a "raid" zone unsuitable for experience.<P>I'm level 59 now.  In the last month, I have been in experience groups (as in "let's go here and play a few hours and get some experience") in The Hole, Kedge Keep (deep), Chardok (often), Howling Stones (some of the best xp AND loot in the game, to compensate for it being pretty difficult to get to), Kael (for hours -- experience AND faction with my friends the dragons), Velketor's Labyrinth (often, one of my favorites).  That's in addition to OS and Karnor's, both of which are way over-crowded and too easy for my tastes.<P>In some of the posts in here, zones were dismissed as "raid" zones because of the difficulty of corpse retrieval in case of a wipeout.  How does that make it a "raid" zone?  It makes it a challenging zone to experience in, but isn't that the point?<P>And someone else counted THURGADIN as a "raid" zone in their "statistical" analysis -- it's primarily a CITY.  I sit on the floor there and practice trade skills!  By that criteria, Freeport is likewise a "raid" zone and therefore must count as content geared to so-called uber guilds.<P>Statistics lie.  Statistics are easily manipulated by those wishing to make a point.  Anyone who can't find enough to do in this game between levels 55 and 60 probably should re-examine how they are looking at this game.<P>If all you want is an easy-to-reach zone to claim "your" 8 mobs who will re-spawn in this certain order, every 23.5 minutes, with NO risk -- yeah, there's a shortage of those -- thank heavens.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Mob UA drops 6 items from loot table UA every time it is killed.<P>Can someone tell me how this DOESN'T both make sense, AND satisify the largest portion of your client base?

</FONT><HR>I personally have no problem with "elite" content.  (Then again, I've pretty much seen every zone cept PoM and Sleepers...stupid nerfed Klandicar spawn time...)<P>The only thing that keeps most people away from certain zones is a base time investment.<P>Take at a look at Kunark.  Trakanon, for arguements sake, was the "pinacle" for the majority of players if you dont count VP.  It took awhile, but on my server there are currently a very large number of guilds able to take him down...which translates to a very high number of people.  The %1 or %5 figures may be true initially at the release of a new expansion, but it soon blossoms to about %10-%15.  Trakanon is no big deal.  The only thing that really limits most people's entry into Veeshan's Peak is the rather tedious key quest which involves a good deal of rare spawns.  I'm sure if that the key quest to VP was made "easier" to do (And I mean faster by easier), then you'd see more people there than the top %1-%5 you cited.  The only thing that is keeping that number from growing at the moment is time, but given enough time that number would grow much as the guilds who are capable of killing Trakanon.<P>Most of the velious content requires massive amounts of level 60s decked out.  Once again, it's a time investment involved as well.  Right now only %1-%5 of the population of a server is killing the dain, zlandicar, etc...<P>So I think the issue with most people is the time required to reach a certain encounter.  <P>I have an issue with the encounters themselves...such as Yelinak(post-patch) and Tunare, who have yet to be killed (Tunare hits for 900 and uses AE silence...Yelinak had his melee beefed and casts an AE mana drain still)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The only groups going there are already formed elsewhere as far as I can tell. Some times I like to log and play for 2 hours. A quarter of that might be finding a group, another quarter travel, then half my time is eaten up.<P>I was in Karnors yesterday and this group was going to warlord room, and only accepted me on the basis that I stay on for at least a few hours.

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;I completely disagree that such organization is beyond most players. I might agree that a lot of players won't want to spend the time that is needed to make that organization.&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>This type of comment from Verant needs to be addressed, because it represents a fixation on unreality.  The key word in the statement is "want".  No matter how many people say it and how many times it's said, Verant simply can't seem to understand that the majority of its player base has jobs, families, friends, and other aspects to life.  It's not a matter of WANT at all, it's a matter of CAN'T. Would you please tune in to the real lives of the majority of your customers?  Do you want to serve us or not?  From the comments in this thread, I gather not ... either we can ditch some essential part of real life or forget it.  Is this what you are seeking?<P>This attitude baffles me.  Verant seems to be embroiled in this never-ending joust with a TINY number of players.  Why don't you just make one uber server, call it the "God" server to feed everyone's egos, put them all there, and then tune things up and up to your heart's desire.  Meanwhile, regardless of how much you say it isn't true, the NORMAL players out here are starving for manageable content post 50.<P>My friends and I (level 50-56) have been combing all areas of Velious that we can possibly get to (so far up to and including CS) with a fine tooth comb looking for SOMETHING productive and enjoyable to do that doesn't require multiple groups or an army.  I am sorry, but it ain't there ( I don't mean zero, but there is so little it's pathetic). Who in the world is supposed to be dealing with the countless ridiculous greens in Velious ... way too much HP, way too much damage, way too little exp - generally none.  What are they there for ... just to annoy us?<P>NORMAL players don't have an army at their disposal.  Nor do they have the time to spend to assemble an army or the multiple groups necessary to do almost anything worthwhile in Velious.  Why must it be designed this way?  WHO is this serving at all? OTOH, NORMAL players do pay the same, and there are a heck of a lot more of us.<P>A partial fix to this problem is remarkably simple.  MAKE MOBS IN VELIOUS CON ACCURATELY AND GIVE EXPERIENCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR HP AND DAMAGE-DEALING CAPACITY. Is this really too much to ask?  Simply taking this one step would instantly create a tremendous amount of PRODUCTIVE content for post 50 players ... and it would affect only a bunch of green stuff that practically no one is killing now, because it's pointless.<P>I must say, Absor, your comments here are very discouraging.  I have been waiting a long time for Verant to comment on this issue, and now that we finally get comments, it seems abundantly clear that you guys don't get it at all.  You have some "vision" of who your customers are that just isn't true. In reality you have a tiny bunch of 24/7 players and tens of thousands of regular folks (who are, nonetheless, serious gamers). I don't think you guys have any clue whatsoever how many people out there are playing less and less, and just getting progressively more discouraged.  I simply cannot understand why you treat such a large segment of your customer base this way.  We WANT to play. How do you expect us to play if you design the game so that we CAN'T.<P>You know, since my main is a cleric, I was pretty irritated with the pattern of cleric nerfs.  But that is totally secondary to this.  PLEASE, nerf me to smithereeens, just please fix THIS.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

(if this assumption is not true... if EQ is your only life than you are hopeless and should be ignored as a sorry excuse for a human life) How many people have played Diablo 2, or Starcraft?

Heh, I bet you feel upset that you are not entitled to go to an Ivy League school like Harvard or MIT also.  You are the type of person that expects to get everything that you want, and I'm sorry to inform you that that is not the way the world works.  There are places in this game that are meant only for a certain segment of the player base to encounter and enjoy.  Deal with it, oh, and if you feel that you would have *wasted* your time by leaving this game for one that gives you whatever you want ( you probably played Diablo 1 with a Trainer) then I truly pity you because you, like many,  have missed the point of Everquest.  It is not about aquiring "stuff", that is the *means* to the end.  The end is having *fun* with other people.  If you feel that all of the levels leading up to where you are now were *work* just to get to the good stuff you will *never* be happy.  That is just the way it is.

</FONT><HR>It's all about choices.<P>You make the choices not to spend the time or energy. You have to accept the consequences for those choices. If you choose to play in such a manner that you can't pull 30+ people together to go on a raid, that was your choice. You COULD have played a different way. If you don't have the organizational skills to make a 30+ guild work, that's your choice again. You can choose to go learn those skills. If you choose not to organize your life around Everquest and spend 8 hours per day playing... that's your choice. It has consequences.<P>An analagy: I'm going skiing next weekend. The resort I'll be at will have a variety of different runs. I happen to be a bad skiier, so most of those runs will be "content" that I will never experience. Why? Because I don't make the choice to become a better skiier. Even if I skiied casually for 30 years, I might never be good enough to go down the really really hard runs. I might have to spend 8 hours / day training if I wanted to do that, and the way I choose to live my life doesn't allow for that. However, I don't blame the ski resorts, skiing in general, or God (or fate or whatever) for that. I COULD choose to pursue skiing. I simply don't want to enough, and I have to live with that choice. The equivalent of this thread would be me requesting all ski runs be tailored to my level. Or the level of 90% of the people who ski (who also will never train 8/hrs per day). Why deprive those people who can and want to excel of content that is meaningful for them? What's wrong with accepting that there are things you will never achieve? The top ski competitions are a lot more interesting when the competitors go down slopes I could never manage. You COULD have them run on Blue-Square runs and not fundamentally alter the competition. <P>The same goes in Everquest. A challenging monster or encounter is only challenging because not every player can do it. For something to be challenging, there has to be the possibility of failure. For something to be REALLY challenging, there has to be a lot more possiblity of failure than success. This could mean two things (More or less abritrary numbers). 1) Every group/guild(no matter what level) that attacks a monster has a 5% chance of winning. 2) 5% of groups/guilds have a good chance of winning, while 95% of groups/guilds have no chance of winning. There is a spectrum between the two, but obviuosly in a stratified game where you gain power, or skill, or whatever (like both Everquest and skiing), it is weighted towards 2. If there is a challenging run in skiing, for instance, it usually doesn't mean that I have a 5% of going down the run without falling down. I have a 0% chance of going down the run without falling down at my current skill level. I probably have a 0% chance of EVER going down that run without falling down. Maybe 5% of skiiers would have a 95% chance of getting down that really challenging run without falling down. But I'm not going to say there shouldn't be runs that are this challenging. And I'm not going to say that there shouldn't be monsters that aren't that challenging in Everquest. In my opinion, there should definitely be there. That's what makes a challenge in the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
