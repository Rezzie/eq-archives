</FONT><HR>Absor, I can handle most of the naming policy rules;  I have a problem with the DELETION WITHOUT NOTICE clause for catagory 1 and 2 offenses.<P>This is totally unacceptable.<P>Catagory 2 uses the very subjective word "offensive":  eg what one person finds offensive another might not.  A GM might find a name "offensive" while not a single in-game player does so.  Given that players are from the entire world (theoretically), it would be difficult to find a word that is NOT "offensive" SOMEWHERE.... the use of "bloody" is not nice in England I believe?<P>I do not object to Verant deciding in a PR sense that a name is "offensive" and it must be changed.<P>I DO object to the Delete Without Notice aspect however.  Whomever developed this should seriously reconsider this policy as, while it's intent was good and would work fine with the blatently obvious examples given in the Naming Policy itsef, it is WAY too open for the less obvious situations.<P>Caeric<BR>Simple Shaman<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

A GM will not contact you before disciplinary action is taken."<P>My problem is that this seems a bit too broad. Any name that is obviously vile would never last past level 5 or so - someone with a borderline name could merrily go on to level 60 without anyone being offended... but suddenly, someone who is overly sensitive notices, and the character is deleted? This seems really harsh. I would urge you to at the very least allow any character with significant playtime on it to have its name changed; to do otherwise, especially without warning, would show so little regard for your players that it borders on contempt.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Kurisu-san, you do realize players are customers right?  As customers lease or not, player do have rights.  The player bill of rights means, if a game company don't respect gamers, then gamers don't have to care about the future products from that company.  One player stop buy one copy of the game means the lost of $40+ and extra $10 a month.  Two players stop buying means $80 and extra $20 a month less.  It does add up, since players have friends and families.  At the end, it the company the suffer not players.  Nothing better than a company digging their over grave.  Right or wrong will be clear in about 9 months.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree with a naming policy but to delete a "lvl 2" offense character without warning in reprehensible, even for Verant.  I play EQ about once a week now, patiently awaiting the release of shadowbane.  I have never deliberately created an offensive name for a character but I did create an offensive surname but did not even realize it until it was pointed out to me.  At that point I had the GM change it.  The point is, of course, that certain names can have meanings that the player is simply unaware of.  (eg. my surname was Kinkayde, and an erudite.  I learned that the name Kincaid was offensive racially on an erudite as it drew a connection to the minstrel "Kunthar Kincaid"  I was not aware of this)  DO NOT immediately ban anyone for this without a fair explaination.  Besides, how could a lvl 1 offense get by the name filter?  hmmmm?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Because people have been asking for a strict Roleplay server for MONTHS, perhaps even years now. All those interested in strict roleplay could go there and be happy and content.  This naming policy is perfect on such a server.<P>But, even though Verant has stated themselves that the game is indeed a Roleplay game, they at the same time have taken the hypocritical view of stating that its NOT a roleplay game in the sense that they will not allow Roleplayers to congregate on one server and be happy.<P>This is a Hack-n-Slash, kill-em-all, who gets the big phat lewts first game. The only thing that even remotely makes it a Roleplaying game is the fact that its in a "fantasy" setting and this somehow makes it a Roleplay game.  I don't understand how that works.

</FONT><HR>Abosr said 'Names that violate the policy today were in violation yesterday. "Grandfathering" those names would legitimize them, and that would be wrong. Just because a bad name hadn't been caught does not justify it.'<P>You forget that there ARE names out that that HAVE been grandfathered since they have existed in some cases from BETA, and these very people have been hasseled about thier names in the past and a fear they will be again.  They were promised that their names were OK, and have had to them changed only to be put back to what they were granfathered to before.<P>Overall, I do not mind these changes, do not mind clarifications.  What you see here is the worry of those people who have seen your customer service's track record in the past and only see the worse.  I do not blame them. <P>This is especially true of the INSTANT NO WARNING DELETION OF CHARACTERS.  I guarantee that some GM or guide will delete some level 60 character that has been around since beta just because they misunderstand a name.  People here are worried about this type of thing.  It is NEVER a good idea to simply delete something with no way of reverting.  NEVER EVER a good idea.   This is the type of thing that gives an EQ player nightmares.  The 'What if i log in someday to discover someone though my name was bad enough and my character is gone forever'.  If you want to calm some peoples fears of this nightmare, let them know it is something that is recoverable.<P>Finally, you need the tone down any language against things that spell words backward in a name.  You do it yourselve and to attack you player base is very hypocritical.  Most famous example... SonyEQ -- Qeynos.  But this is not something the is just in the old game... Theres teh kobold in Velketors called Tops --- Spot.  There is the giant spy in Skyshrine called Sentry Rotiart -- Traitor.  To say you can change a persons name because it is a word backward is not right when you do it yourself.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

To allow a system to be put in place whyby it is possible that a person who has put 100+ days into a charcter to one day log in and discover that their character has been deleted is WRONG!   This is akin to in real life making a law that says 'Anyone who is found to have commited a certain crime will be shot on sight'  No matter how much everyone may agree that people who do that crime should be shot, because it is a system run by people who themselves can make a mistake, you would leave yourselve open to shooting someone that is innocent with no way of reversing what you had done.

</FONT><HR><BR>Oh no, no, no, no, no.  This can't be right.  Deleting characters with no warning?  I mean come on.  I mean, isn't that taking things a bit too far?  Was Verant taken over by the Taliban when I wasn't looking and suddenly they must destroy those things they don't like? <P>(Recent news: the Taliban started destroying major artifacts from other religions, stating that they were evil and that to look upon them was to remove oneself from Allah.  Sorry, thought I might need to explain the reference.)  <P>If a character has seriously played time on a character, then obviously he/she has gone through the world of Norrath without causing a huge cultural breakdown.  Dogs and Cats did not start living together, the earth did not shudder, the rivers did not boil, there were no locusts.  In other words, things pretty much continued as normal.  <P>Ergo, to allow that character 6 hours of game time or two weeks of real time, (people do go on vacation), to change their name is not beyond the pale.  The odds are, that since the world survived this long, it can probably survive the amount of time it takes these players to come up with new names.  <P>I further note that the name policy doesn't list a method whereby a player can protest a name change demand. If there is no recourse, no official path to follow when your name is protested, it appears to give a wide berth of power to a subsect of your player base who also volunteer as guides.  I believe that there is huge potential for mistakes, errors, misunderstandings and bad press.  <P>This seems to me to be a particularly draconian response to what was a fairly minor problem. <P>Itt would seem that you want everyone choose a random series of letters such as is generated by the naming engine.  Because, according to your rules, everything else can be petitioned.  I guarantee that there's enough college students with access to the OED that they could petition almost any word using 6 . . . and you be surprised by sheer volume of things which could be made to fit under #'s 1,2, and 3 by a diligent linguist. <P>And I guarantee the first time you delete someones big ol 60th lvl planes raiding uber player, that you will have a diligent linguist. <P>I know it's hard to read tone in text, so please note that I'm not being sarcastic with the follow request.  I'm sure this question came up when this decision was made, I wonder if any of the team would share the answer:  Who exactly are you serving by deleting the character?

Nobody would have any problem if you hired a person that checks every name of every character created before he is one month old. If your name doesn't bother anybody for a month (or 100 hours played or whatever), it can't be so bad.<P>Enforcement by denunciation is NOT a good method.

I guess more than anything this just bemuses me.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
