</FONT><HR>Eendyar, you are almost certainly correct. The clerics who got screwed on the poof should just thanks their god they aren't a mage because if they were, Zordak would only be one of 3 mobs with drops they need and the drops would only be 1 in 20 chance of actually happening. And one of them would be on the 7th island of Air. <P>Then again, the whole corpse poofing thing isn't much of a concern for mages because none of their mobs are guaranteed to have a peice for their epic. It's all random. Yes you can go to Hate and kill Innoruuk 50 times and not see your required epic item peice. At least Zordak has it every time.<P>Just be glad you can raid sol b to get your stuff instead of the zone least likely to be actually played in due to the insane time and plat commitments needed to do it. Like 7th island of Air and it's usual TWO DAY COMMITTMENT OF 36 PEOPLE REQUIRED TO GET THERE.<P>Just be glad you don't have to farm quillmane for months on end, fighting newbies for the kill.<P>/sigh<P>Can't the designers come up with something a BIT more interesting and actually doable by, say, the top five percent of the most determined players of eq? As opposed to 0.001 % ?<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Actually, both times Ragefire poofed for us we had only one meleer go linkdead.<P>In both cases we had between 24 and 30 people in play.  No DoTs. <P>Ragefire died fast in both cases: less than a minute, I'd estimate.  In the second poof, the meleer (a monk with Celestial Fists) went link dead more or less as soon as the dragon-form of Ragefire spawned.  The LD monk got the kill.<P>The best way possible, in my opinion, to fix this problem would be to allow players to selectively disable their AI on linkdeath.  I.E.: an option that says, when I go link dead, I want to just stand there and do nothing.  On large multi-group raids it would be a no brainer to turn this on.<P>Just my two cents worth.  By the way, we have a cleric re-doing all the work necessary to re-spawn Ragefire at the moment.  Lost shimmering pearls, and lost time for 30+ people: not a good situation.<P>The customer service response: its not a bug.  You must be exploiting something.  What *are* they talking about?  What a great exploit: lose 250+ player hours of effort in one stupid second.  Personally, I don't find that this enriches my game play experience at all.<P>Paeter</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Regarding link death avoidance:<P>In both instances where we had Ragefire poof, our entire guild (guild only event) followed these instructions:<BR>- all PC and NPC spells off<BR>- all unneccessary combat messages off (fighters need to see some messages)<BR>- all particle effects off<BR>- detail off<P>Our raid leaders were very cognizant of linkdeath potential, mainly from the perspective of mass death rather than corpse poofing.  On the second instance, all the casters were instructed to face the walls (I.E.: so that they saw nothing, thus received less graphical update data).  This time we were grasping at straws to reduce the possiblity of linkdeath to near zero.  In both cases, we had a single person go linkdead: once a warrior, once a monk.  In both cases, the linkdead person got the kill ("Ragefire is killed by Soandso!").  In both instances, Ragefire poofed.<P>Many if not most of my guildmates have high speed internet connections (ADSL or cablemodem).  Most have higher-end machines (500 MHz Pentiums and up).  So I really don't see that there is much more we can do from our end.<P>Before our last Ragefire poof, someone jokingly said "If you think you are going to go Linkdead, turn off attack before you do!".  If someone gives me that piece of advice as anything other than a jest, I will not be laughing.<P>At this point, I am not sure what problem having corpses poof, ANY corpses, when killed by linkdead PC's solves.  The only one I can think of: when linkdead, a PC operates as an NPC with appropriate hitpoint and ability buffs.  I suppose some might consider this a benefit...although NPC AI and pathing leaves a lot to be desired, attribute buffs notwithstanding. <P>As I said, however, I think most paying customers who understand large group raids would *joyfully* turn off all linkdeath AI and just stand there rather than accidentally cause a corpse to poof.<P>Absor, can you comment on this?  I'm not asking for whatever secrets might exist regarding why corpses must poof, but perhaps you can provide an explanation why disabling player AI on link death can't be accomplished?  If this could be achieved as a configurable option (so that soloing players, or lower level characters can leave linkdeath AI active), that would be ideal.<P>Paeter</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Can you clarify why players carry on casting and meleeing after going LD? I'm sure I read ages ago it was put in so a player would have a 'fighting' chance of survival if they went LD mid-fight. If this is the case I think you need to re-examine it as anyone over lvl 20 or so isn't going to survive unless the mob was extremely low health.<P>At 50+ it's a curse. We either need the auto-melee/cast when LD disabled or we need a client-side switch so we can turn it off if we so choose.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ragefire poofing has been observed at least once by a Verant representative.  Unfortunately, not a GM but a guide.  See this thread:<P>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047332.html<P>I'm guessing a couple of GMs have also seen Ragefire poof.  But the problem the developers and testing staff have is that they can't recreate it.   To fix a bug, you need to be able to make a change that you *believe* will correct the problem and then test thant change by repeat a sequence of steps that consistantly causes the same thing to happen.  <P>If you can't recreate it (I.E.: if it seems to happen "randomly") you can't fix it with any certainty.  <P>Hopefully they find a test that makes ragefire poof consistantly...<P>Paeter</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

A "General" rule's effect under "General" circumstances "Generally" has the "desired" effect. In <BR>some obviously "Specific" instances, that<BR>are by no means "General" (The words EPIC and QUEST come to mind/[Ref A]) is having a "Specifically Undesired" effect.

(That means uncuff your Customer Service Stormtroopers and have them reimburse those people they called LIAR and gave no method to disproove those claims while culpability of said proof AND sole capability for providing proof resides within your own Organization, apparently incapable, and beyond the reach or reasonable request of those who the system theoretically exists to serve.<P>Now. To coin a new word for you. I call this a "BOG" yes, thats right a "BOG". <P>"BOG"s occur when what should not be happening is happening and beyond all belief the system itself is breaking down all around it, further inflamming what could possibly already be an outrageously frustrating experience for BOTH your Revenu Ba$e and your Customer Service Babysitters. Ah. Babysitters you say? No No you wouldn't EVER say it.

</FONT><HR>Alan,<P>poofing corpses on a megaquest is bad enough. but at least it can be coded to be fixed. What is ABSOLUTELY incorrigeable is the fact that your CS department has been handcuffed by company policy of no reimbursals, which is in fact no customer service at all. If I go down to Wal-mart and buy a coffemaker, to have it blow up on me the next day, I go down to the store with receipt in hand and get a new one. Supposedly your log capabilities were improved last year to where you cna verify if someone is trying to scam you or not. If the logs show that it indeed poofed, you should be doing the reimbursal. END OF DISCUSSION. Your CS department is the worst I have seen in 42 years of living on the planet earth, i have to admit. and it needs serious attention NOW.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

We will not be complacent, and we will not smile and nod when we're being given the ultra-short stick of it. 10 man days. I would wager your GM Staff might work close to that in a week.

How is this possible when the GM knew (from the first reimbursal) that we already had the pearl.<P>One of the very first things the Lead-GM (Axgoreth) said upon his arrival is "The logs have been checked".

Oh, and according to the Lead GM on our server, only one person is impacted when Ragefire poofs: the cleric.  Excuse me?  30+ people had to spend hours of their time to defeat several major mobs (Ixblat Fer, Overking in Chardok, even Ragefire himself although he isn't really that tough) only to see it all *wasted* due to a "feature" of the software.  *THAT* is what is making 30+ people angry every time Ragefire poofs, and I will not stand there and be told that my 10+ hours of effort are not important because I'm not the one turning in the pearl.<P>Tell your CS people (GMs, Lead GMs) that it *is* considered a bug at the moment, albeit one who's cause is not clearly understood.  The GM's should be authorized to help people by refunding lost shimmering pearls (NOT the loot from ragefire, the item that TRIGGERS ragefire's transformation) on the condition that the GM observe the victim's next Ragefire attempt.  Tell those same GMs to observe and log (server side) any Ragefire attempts using refunded pearls and provide those logs to development.<P>If you do the above, I would suggest that you are on the road to actually providing some degree of satisfaction to the impacted individuals.  <P>Paeter</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
