</FONT><HR>In my guild on Veeshan there are 4 rogues that have completed their quest.  We have several casters of different types nearing completing theirs.<P>This is "wonderful" if still a bit disapointing that VI could not make it more challenging to the classes that have it the easiest already.  YET I am even more troubled that no paladin on any server has yet to START their quest.  Fine make it epic and difficult but at least put the starting NPC in plain sight like you have for every other class.  <P>The lack of paladin reports are due to one of two things.<P>1. VI has placed the start in a completly out of the way place OR just plain forgot to add in the proper trigger NPCs like they did with the ORIGINAL FA quest.<P>2. Every server is now filled with paladins that have just decided "why bother".  They play other classes and only keep their paladin around for plane/dragon raids.<P>Both of these are disturbing at best and just plain SICK at worst.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>A couple questions here.<P>"This is "wonderful" if still a bit disapointing that VI could not make it more challenging to the classes that have it the easiest already"<P>Could you explain again why it is that you are disapointed in the rogue version quest? Do you play a rogue? I do not understand this. Also, could you explain to me how rogues are the "easiest" class to play? I do not see this. If you were in a class that was not being premited in groups for over a year, how could you be in the "easiest" class? And please do not being up things about experience penalty. XP penalty does not make a class harder to play, it only makes a class harder to level. There is a difference.<P>"YET I am even more troubled that no paladin on any server has yet to START their quest."<P>Now, I will give you that I have not been following many of the other class FA style quest. And that I may have missed something. But I have to ask a question. Did paladins receive a second FA style quest with this new additions? Are paladins going to receive 2 FA style weapons? Are they the only class that will receive 2 FA style quest? Remember, they have the original "FA style quest". <P>If I am correct in my belief of why paladin on any servers may have not started their quest, a third option not listed could be the case:<P>3. Every server is filled with paladins that realize that their "FA style quest" has already been solved and that the weapon (while needing an upgrade change) is the Fiery Avenger.<P>-Wadin Pureheart of Quellious<BR>Ranger, 52 summers<BR>Bootleggers Guild Master<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I think the reason why most paladins have no started or posted anything about the epic quest is because we got disappointed with soulfire which was pretty hard before kunark came out and game opened up  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"> then we got the mysterious Fiery Avenger which was supposed to be god weapon but about a month later not even kunark opens up with ungodly weapons at little or no cost of verants word of risk vs reward tactic. much easer to goto chardok and pick up that Staff of shielding and headed to sebilis to pick up that sword of morning that to do a monsterious FA quest when better weapons in kunark ) I think the paladin class is just disappointed that we strive to do allllll this work to get a weapon that cant compare to what Kunark has ! I prefer not to do FA entirely not worth it same design as soulfire wtf :P they couldn't even make a new image for it :P so I don't think paladins are not doing the epic quest I just think we are not trying as hard to get it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> I for one am not to keen on doing the quest yet till i found out whats involved and what the stats are  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Valhakar,<BR> <BR>Let see if I get your post correctly? Paladins get 2 FA style quests. Rogues gets 1 FA style quest. Rogues have solved their FA style quest. So now you want to get the Rogues nerfed? Because you think rogue quest is to easy? But you think that paladin quest are to hard?<P>Are you not be extremely selfish here? You are campaigning to get rogues nerfed for not better reason then because you cannot find paladins who have started their SECOND FA STYLE QUEST. Seems pretty stupid and immature to me.

</FONT><HR>Wadin,<P>What he was saying was that Rogues have finished their FA style quest already. True we paladins get 2, BUT how long did it take us paladins to finish our first one, a few months if I remember correctly.  So now Rogues get a FA style quest and they finish it with in a few weeks, hmmm seems real fair to me, and the stats on the Rogue weapon kick ass, almost puts the FA sword to shame.  If you compair the risk to reward factor the Rogue FA style weapon DOES put the paladins first FA to shame.  Sure we get more quests then anyone else, but who is going to do them if they rewards keep turning out to be crap after Verant makes new weapons for other classes and make them much easier to get and almost as good.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Efreeti,<P>Sure some consider that Rogue quest easy. Some even say that the dagger is very nice. It really comes down to a Catch 22 situations. People complain about quest being easy then turn around and complain about it being to difficult. We cant have both. This stuff about Risk-vs-Reward is someone's pipe dream of a wish. You can either have a very nice and dynamic quest that is challenging and gives you good satisfaction when completing it, or you can have a quest that allows level 46 rogues to get a nice weapon and make you feel cheated if you are higher level. Your choice. Do you want something exciting or something ever other paladin has?<P>You should note, that I did mention that I believe that the FA is a bit underpowered now. This is only because of the new weapons. Before Kunark it was the best 2hander in the game, if I remember correctly. And it still does not negate the fact that paladins have something no other class has right now. We should be happy that the rogues found their weapon. And that it is a nice weapon. We should not be trying to get it or the quest "nerfed". <P>Decide what we want. Easy quest that anyone and their mother can complete giving the lowest twink of us a FA style quest. Or dynamic quest that takes some work to complete. The ease of the rogue quest is really in perception. They still have to go to a lot of places, find a lot of rares, turn in a lot of items that are of extreme value. Do you realize that a rogue has to Pick Pocket a rare mob in Hate for an item for his weapon? Do you realize that many rogue have never developed their Pick Pocket skill because there was no need to and it would piss off groups that they going. When a rogue Pick Pockets a mob, the loot supposily comes from the same loot pool you and I get when we kill it. So a rogue would be stealing from a group to develop their Pick Pocket skill. <P>I say again. Stop trying to get Rogues nerfed.<P>-Wadin Pureheart of Quellious<BR>Ranger, 52 summers<BR>Bootleggers Guild Master<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I think the FA epic quests should be what they are suppose to be, Very tough, long and exciting to do.  I don't think the rogue quest is being nerfed, it is being fixed.  These weapons should not become so common that every one should be EXPECTED to have one.  So, if a server is getting 4 in one day then maybe, just maybe...it is a tad too easy.<P>And to answer your question before you say it... Uh.. Why should I care?  I don't.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Because I do not like "nerfs" to other classes because people feel they have things tougher then them. We are already seeing the rogue quest nerfed because it is stated that it is to easy. We do not even know what the other will take (except the bards) and we are already calling for nerfs on a class? This is just wrong. And I do not care if it was a rogue weapon or a paladin weapon. It is just wrong to call for this nerf. We do not know the situations that caused 4 to show in one day. Could it have been dumb luck that some of these people already had a couple of the items in their bank prior to the quest being implemented? Could it be because they worked together over serveral weeks, each obtaining the items need during that time so that when the final part was found, it was an easy jump for all 4 to complete the quest in relatively short time? There where many factors that could have cause this. But to nerf it without really taking into consideration these alternatives is just wrong, IMO.<P>When does it stop? When are people going to be satified? If the paladins find their weapon and 4 pop on that server within 2 days, is the rest of the EQ community going to call for paladins quest to be nerfed? If the paladins enjoy the style their quest ends up as, do we want the rest of the EQ community to call for paladins quest to be nerfed? Why should they enjoy their quest when no one else does? This misery-loves-company mentality should not be accepted as the status quo of EQ playing.<P>-Wadin Pureheart of Quellious<BR>Ranger, 52 summers<BR>Bootleggers Guild Master<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well hopefully it will stop when they get the quests right.  This isn't a Yak, we are talking about.  These are suppose to be king of the hill type weapons which in my opinion shouldn't be as common as fine steel weapons. hehehehe<P>Verant always under estimates the abilities of the players when it comes to getting things done.  These quests should almost fall into the catagory... "You gotta be LUCKY as #$%$ to get one and not just have the power to do the steps in the quest."<P>I'm sure everyone would want one. But again, I feel these weapons should be rare and very few per server...sort of got off topic of the nerf/fix but sort of blends in with what I'm trying to say. hehehe<P>Also, I'm sure the rogue quest isn't "easy" but I just would hate that any quest of this magnitude to get trivial.<P>Thanks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>FINAL WORD<BR>what has every paladin been told he is since first getting nerfed from a group or disallowed.  " you have quests you can go do"  have you looked at the ro quest folks?  it's a fricken nitemare to do.  if i was to just realy on my ro quest armor before treewaeve or deepwater i'd still be lvl 32.  it takes sssooooooooooooooo much to do a paladin quest.  and the reward was barly worth it.  now what happend?  verant first dumped armor that drops off critters that makes ro look like leather.  then weapons as good as all but the fiery drop in kunark like leaves from a tree and they can be used by more then just paladins.  now the thrid nail in our quest coffin eq gives other quests to other classes easier then the paladins n with better rewards.  yes i'd trade a fiery avenger for the new rogue weapon if i could use it in a heart beat and does it take both hands like our damn no one shield useable 2hs fiery  [culdn't care less if i can still bash i'm a knight where is my darn shield].  now you can not tell me your quest is even one 1/2 as hard as a paladins sword quest.  and to tell the truth after we  have done allllllllll the quests that we get don't u think if any class could do a fa quest fast it would be the paladin who bar none is the most questing class there is?????????????<BR>..... well go whine rogue as u do n by the way i know how valuable rogues are my best friend is one.  but with selfcenterd little jerks like u it makes me want to keep the illusion up that rogues are useless in a group.  [todate i have problely been a bigger advocate for rogues then most rogues have been but i could change]<BR>......we paladins get less then 3/4 of our warrior bretherns skills disiplines and abilities.  last i looked 4 paladins in a group didn't equal a 3 warrior 1 cleric group.  and on top of being cut short we get a exp penalty wow hate to tell u how many friends i have lost do to them out lvling me.  and the only n i mean the only bone verant threw us was the boasting rights to haveing the best quest weapon and that involved soo many quests inside the quests and factions beyond beliefe [over 500bone chips to raise but two factions and i could go on n on about the other factions and compents needed too.] the only boast we had was when all said n done we had the fiery and now your rogue weapon puts our fiery to shame and with less then half the work too.  you have some nerve comming in here and telling us that we are whinning over nothing. personaly if u can't be honest then shut up rogue.  i can be honest rogues are great in groups with uses often over looked.  now can u be honest about what verant did?  i have complained to verant that paladins don't need 2hs for it's not our style i have been honest when i told verant that green kills should drop no loot.  i have been honest when i say the traditional mix can be changed and still have a great group.  but i will not listen to your self absorbed lieing views on fa type quests.  perhaps if your charecter revolved around epic quests from your first days yu'd know this.  you are like a spoiled child how was given a item before you evr knew what it was like to earn such an item.  you have no respect for the fa quest there for i have no respect for you or your view good day n may you rot in the plane of hate.  seems to be a fitting place for you. to the rest of you all good day.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
