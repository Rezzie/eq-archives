</FONT><HR>I think Verant is see this whole area as possibibly very unbalancing to the game.  If you look at the Buff potions you can see that they tried to achieve balance by providing good effects with bad side effects.  The other way was to set the prices up so high that not a lot of items would actually sell.<P>They saw that their first attempts with Alchemy were way too cautious and had to rething the balance.  So besides fixing a few bugs, they lowered the component costs, but what did that really do?  Well, for one it made it so more Shamans would try the skill and use the money skink, not much else changed.  The original poster is right that increasing the vendor by-back to %90 would lower the practice costs and probably would also increase the number of Shamen attempting the skill.<P>However, we're back to my original observation, does Verant really want all that many "unbalanced" magical items in the world?  I don't see these things as unbalancing due to their throw away nature, and the fact that none of the spell effects are different than what you might get from a regular caster's spell.  Even if Verant didn't feels that Alchemy threatened the balance, they probably feel they can't allow the potion prices to fall so much that they would be commonly used because this would impact on the other spell casters.<P>One way around this problem is to implement entirely new effects that can only be found with potions.  These effects would have to be desirable, and the cost vs benefit would have to be explored, but at least this way Alchemy would have it's own nich and not impact on other casters.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>There needs to be a no hit regen potion out there to help melees solo.  It definately should not have a dehaste effect, -5 str maybe, -5 sta maybe.  Greater heals should cost about 100 pp.<P>The reason heals are dangerous is because people can use them to heal in special fights.  I would not go above greater heal.  Escape yes.  Full heal no.  Regen would be the perfect solution to the downtime issue for melee players.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I would love to see shaman potions that can duplicate some of the other clases self-only spells.  Shields, shape-shifting, damage shields, binds.  All of these could be enjoyed by the other classes to a degree (of course it shouldn't be as powerful or long lasting as the original)<P>About prices, think about jewlrey...  You can make plus stat items at level one (with a friend enchanting for you, maybe) for a couple of plat that last forever.  You cannot hope to make a single potion until after 25 (and even then your max skill is 5 until you level up!) and the least expensive one is no less than 5-6 plat, and they last only a few minutes.  SOMETHING can be done to balace this out, and make alchemy the truly useful skill that it wants to be.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Kudos, to all my fellow shamen!  Yes, I knew that we were extremely civilized, but this is extraordinary.  It is absolutely wonderful to be able to read a post with this many replies and not get bogged down in the usual whining/complaining/shouting.<P>I am a level 30 barbarian shaman, and have only just started my career in alchemy.  I trained the max number at my guild (which, by the way, is extremely irritatingly far away from where I'm fighting in Ill Omen, but that's another topic,)then bought *stuff*!<P>The lesser stat potions I made were completely useless (I won't bore you with the details, just suffice it to say that my level 9 buffs were better, *and* they stacked).  Thank goodness I stopped at 3.  I doubt very much that I could even give them away to anyone except a level 1-3 character.  What an utter waste of funds.<P>BoW potions, on the other hand, pretty much rock. I do agree though, that something really needs to be done about the stackability.  Sure, I can sell BoW potions, but if they would stack, I could sell manymanymanyMANY more!  <P>Does anyone else play with monks?  Hello!  Even though potions aren't incredibly heavy, when you get any significant number of anything that doesn't stack, you're beginning to talk over-optimal-weight.  Even though I am more than happy to keep my monks SoWed when we're playing, I can't always be in 'their' world.<P>I agree that a discussion on what shamans would like to see in Alchemy is not a bad idea (in fact, it's fantastic).  However, the one message board that I would suggest for such a forum (http://home.elp.rr.com/wolfclan/alchemy/alchemyindex.html) will probably not be monitored by Verant, and it seems that all discussions on this site get overwhelmed by 'other' topics.<P>In some ways, it's too bad that shamans are so polite.  Maybe if we whined and complained a bit (okay, a lot) more like some other classes, this issue would have been fixed a long time ago.  It just goes to show that Verant did a great job creating our class!<P>Xudor Vientobe<BR>Lvl 30 Barbarian Shaman<BR>Who LOVES being a Barbarian and a Shaman!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I don't play a shaman, but one thing I would love would be if you were able to make a bind potion.  I'm sure they would be expensive and all.  But just having one with you in those times that no one is around to bind....would save alot of time.  I usually won't run to go hunt or something unless I'm bound.  Heh, I don't mind having to run constantly on body runs, keeping sow potions in the bank also helps with the trip.  But having to take a boat and all that because you couldn't find a bind...sometimes its enough to make me wanna pk :P<P>But anyway, hope they do give bind potions some thought.<P>Kaedra<BR>Rogue on Rallos Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Remember those video games where after your spaceship was distroyed your next one came up in a semi-invincible mode for just long enough that you could get resituated and not get killed by the same attack wave that killed you the first time?<P>I was thinking that a potion that did this kind of thing would be very nice.  You die, get this potion from the bank, and run back to your corpse.  The key to this potion is that it provides you with protection as long as you don't attack,  anything, and your weight is 0, for a reasonibly limited period, enought to run a few zones or something.  This spell wouldn't stack with anything either, so you couldn't suddenly pop in all buffed up and ready to go.  The idea is that once you get to your corpse you'd would drag it to relative safety and loot it.<P>I sugest that this potion provide almost perfect invisability.  Almost perfect in that no one but a god could see through it.<P>I know that most high leveler will want a Full Res, but would this fill a need when one is not available?  It would be sort of a last resort for when you can't get a Cleric, can't get a Pally, can't get a Necro, and can't get a group.<P>Of course this potion should be very expensive, say a couple of hundered Plats.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>A Poison-style fix for alchemy:<P>1) Gate potions will have their trivial levels reduced to about 100 skill to alleviate the bottleneck at 70 (Naturally, they won't actually be any easier to make).<P>2) All vendor buyback costs will be doubled (of course, the herb prices will be doubled as well).<P>3) The need to use batwings, snake scales, and fish scales as reagents when drinking a potion will be removed (instead, you'll need black pearls).<P>4) The "other" set of components which barbs lack will be moved out of the evil cities to put all races on an equal footing (of course they'll be moved to an NPC that isn't in the game yet; don't worry though, he should be added when SoV is released).<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
