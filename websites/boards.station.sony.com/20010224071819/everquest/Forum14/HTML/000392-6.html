</FONT><HR>Balance your "nerf".<P>Move celestial elixir to level 50-52.  2-3 more upgrades to the celestial line of spells at 54-56 and 58-60.  Improved healing over time doing 2000, 2500, 3000+ and add a cure poison/disease component (with each pulse) at level 50.  Increase the first few pulses of healing accordingly.  The "agro" factor does NOT change beyond what the first in the series does.  Too powerful?  I think not, its no more powerful or unbalancing than your "ch" nerf is.  The celestial line is the only thing "unique" to the cleric class atm.  Everything else is shared.<P>Atone - upgrade it 3 times.  3rd at level 49.  It becomes unresistable at the 2nd upgrade.  Yes, that means it becomes unresistable like wizard lures and ignores all checks for MR regardless of the mob.  Its casting time/recycle time becomes 1.5 seconds/instant recycle at 3rd upgrade and costs no more than 25 mana AND is alteration.<P>Divine series.  We get another upgrade at 49.  Faster recycle, no more than 3 minutes - duration 30 seconds, heals 2+ bubbles while on.<P>Increase dodge/defense/agi for the cleric class.<BR>Give us parry/evade on par with warriors since they can no longer taunt - see your own message boards for feedback attesting to this.<BR>Increase our armor of protection personal buff to double in effectiveness every level to compensate for your "nerf".<P>Abashi says we have to "learn to manage our agro".  Well, give us the tools and upgrades to do it.  You "nerf" something the class has had for years and give nothing in return.  /sarcasm on - First class "tuning" all the way.  /sarcasm off.  The fact that we are dealing with the nerf with nothing to "balance it" right now shows how much you care.  If you do implement improvements, you should have done the nerf/improvements at the same time.  Again, it shows how much you care.  There is no excuse for poor planning at this stage of the game, after 2 years of nerfs and patches.<P>Do these things fast before you lose another subscriber.<P>Thx info.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Someone mentioned raising the cleric defense skill to 200, it already is 200.  It's listed wrong on a couple websites but it is 200.  I currently have 199 on my 51 cleric, it goes up VERY slow from 175-200, mostly because we don't tank too much, but since I solo'd most of 28-47 it didn't fall too far behind. I do remember it taking 4 levels of play to go from 180 to 181, but it went up quickly after that for a bit, then slowed down again.  This is the same defense skill as Rangers have, which is rediculous because I have Plate Armor, Better Buffs, and Same Defense skill, so the AC difference between my cleric at 32 and my ranger at 32 is about 100-150AC in favor of the cleric.  If anyone needs a defense bump its rangers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor<P>  I really dont understand how you can come to the conclusion on why the cleric class is so powerful. Please explain this in detail to me? I have a cleric So I can talk in great detail why we are not. It seems to me you are nerfing the cleric so the the druids are more of a option to be chosen to be in a group. But I have to ask why are you doind this? In fact why are you making so many changes in general. Fact is people picked there characters and should live with em. I picked a healing class. Yes I picked the primary healer. Yet now with your changes I dont see how I will still be the promary anymore. I know first hand how this agro is taking effect. Go to a dragon raid cast ch and watch your self die. You instantly get summoned to the dragon. Now in some ways I can agree with the clerics being attacked by a group cause of the healing abilities. But then again I see this as the final straw as to why I will be starting my first twink character. Ill get back to my point. I drift to much sorry. First you have honest clerics who dont make much money in the game. And you have uber twink clerics. Who get the best stuff in the game unobtainable by the standard player. Now this guy can actually take a hit or 2 butI myself can not. So with this in mind I will not be casting my ch anytime soon. And I am almost positive alot of clerics will be hesitant also. Now with this you have basicaly leveld me down to the healing with a druid. That is all fine and dandy. But now when groups go to choose who they want in a group. They will most likely pick a druid for all there utility spells with close to the same healing powers.  <P>  All I ask is for you to rethink your thought before watering down my character anymore than has been done. It really seems to me you are changing my class in order to accomadate another. I did the home work on my guy. And i chose for 50 hard earned levels to be a more boring class to have a certain power in the high end levels. Other classes decided to chose a watered down class to have more fun and be in general more powerful. You guy are watering down the cleric. Hell we have a spell we will never use, yaulp 4. Yet we get it nerfed? Why to help another class. Why not just give them there unique verion of it? and just stop reducing us over and over again. <P>  As for clerics being to over powered. Just rememeber we are not. We are only powerful in a group. Let me say that again, Only in a group. Druids are powerful in both. We for our entire lifes in eq have to always find a group to get any exp. I know this is a group game but you have limited my class directly to it. Then one another class says at a certain level he cant get groups. you water us down to let him in. When probally for 50 levels he never even wanted a group since his exp moved so much better with out one.<P><BR>tried to make it sound clean. Even though I am very frutrated with what you are doing. I didnt want this to be a rant fest and more informative on someone else end. I really in my eyes do not feel the people who are making these changes even play a cleric. I really feel you play a druid.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"powerfull" should not only mean power in a group environment.  It should mean all aspects of the class; travel, group, solo, utility.  We may be "powerfull" in a group but past 50 we cant solo at all.  I think you should look at "powerfull" as the ability to advance in the game with or without a group, cause believe it or not we all cant find groups all the time but still want to play the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Two things about the recent balancing of clerics.<P>First I can live with the Donald's BP nerf but 30 seconds is kinda long now that its one CH per person.  Any chance that you all might consder making this a very short casting time?  So that ie could become an emergency CH?<P>The recent patch change to the agro that a complete heal presents seemes a bit out of line, can you check on this again to make sure its not over compensating?<BR>Last night my group of mid 50s were in a dungeon.  We had 2 creatures mezed and were fighting a third.  One of the two warrior in the group was getting low on hit points so the cleric attempted a CH of the warrior.  The creature we were fighitng (2 warriors and a rogue) was just under half health at the time.  When the CH went off the creature immediately turned on the cleric who was brought to half health by the time the melee could get it off her.  Ok not a horrid occurance but a bit excessive that a creature that had been being beat on and taunted for over half of its health would immediatey turn on a cleric after one CH.<BR>Then one of the mezed creatures broak free and instead of going after the enchanter (like prepatch) it immediately went after the cleric who had CHed the warrior moments before.<P>It would appear that the CH was providing as much agro as if the cleric had cast a 3k nuke on every creature in the agro range.  Can you check this out please as it appears quite unfair to the clerics.  Perhapse there needs to be a cap on the agro that CH can provide above 50 as well as the cap you provided post 50.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have commmonly found that Healing a Tank will get a mezzed mob mad at the healer (pre-patch).  Now this is with a Druid and chaincast GHeal, not with the formerly ultra-low aggro, one-cast CH.  Since I am playing both the Druid and the Enchanter at the same time, I use this to my advantage since it is MUCH easier to re-mez something if it is hitting my Druid rather than the Chanter.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Although I certainly see why Clerics would be upset that Healing creates more Agrro, it just doesn't make sense that SupHeal and CHeal wouldn't generate less aggro than GHeal.<P>Is it possible that there is a problem with the Mobs not "remembering" damage for a long enough period of time?  For example, if a Tank does 5000 pts of damage over a few minutes of time, and then the Cleric CHeals for 3500 (instantaneously), is the mob going to stomp the Cleric?  It shouldn't since the Tank has still done more damage.  If it does, then the Mob's "memory" needs to be adjusted.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Someone has already done this...but looking on some of the general boards over changes in the hate stuff, then seeing this made me laugh:<P>Absor<BR>Station Member   posted 02-16-2001 03:22 PM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>About these lists:<BR>First and foremost, understand that this is only a list of concerns to be brought to the Live Team. This is not a list of promises, and I'm certainly not telling you that any or all of these items will be changed or implemented.<P>[sfnhltb: he is also not telling us that some of them may appear in the game with almost no warning or discussion of the details of the way they will be implemented either]<P>Also, there are three types of items that I don't have listed here. Epic Quests, Magic Resistances in Velious and Mid-level quests. Those three items were mentioned by enough classes that I've pulled them out for separate examination.<P>All items are currently marked with NONE for status. Obviously we've already started working on some items, you've seen the lists from the patch messages on the Test Server. I will be updating the status for items early next week to reflect those potential changes and with any responses from the team. I just wanted to get these lists out to you fresh.<P>[Test Server? I thought it was the Test Server is dead, long live testing on the Live Servers ;p]<P>Course I shouldnt laugh (or cry) over this sort of thing, as i write software for a living as well (not games tho), and we always used to do these sorts of live low testing changes all the time...customer shouting loudly for change gets change, customers more or less happy with existing system get stuck with a change that may or may not stop them working.<P>We have a new QA system in place (well, theoretically anyway), doesnt seem to happen much...changes still happen but the get a little more thought about them and some more testing. Result? Whiny customer phones up one extra time and we tell him that the solution is on its way, but needs more testing before we release it, easy to please customer sees less patches to deal with and less likelihood of interruption to his work through bugs.<P>There is porbably a downside...i.e. you end up doing testing...ugh, i know i hate it too, but you arent really providing a piece of software to the customer...you are providing a service to help them work (or have fun, whichever), so the testing is increasing the value of your software probably much more than a few extra untested man days of programming ever could.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>   You've asked that we address balance issues, and not enhancements or 'toys' that might skew the existing balance.  With that in mind, I'll try to relate my own thoughts.<P>The post-50 game is hosed right now.  I think that the balance issues post-50 are the direct result of Verant breaking the scaling factor of the game in those levels.  Balance in that game will have to wait until this latest patch issue is resolved in some way.<P>I think you'd hear much less *****ing from the clerics, however, if we didn't feel that we had to suffer so much in the pre-fifty game just to get to the point of usefulness.<P>Clerics have very little utility.  While we do have a variety of spells to choose from, we don't have any strategic combinations that allow us to break from our 'heal and med' role.  The shamans and druids have certain options that clerics don't.  When a shaman/druid gets tired of grouping, he can effectively solo in the pre-fifty game, just for a change of pace.<P>Clerics, arguably, don't have the option of breaking from this role.  We stare at that spellbook, and play out our single schtick.  Until level 34 or so, many of us are passed up for groups because Shamans and Druids are effective enough healers as to make no difference in comparison, and the utility they add more than compensates for whatever healing bonus the cleric might have.<P>You can't balance this issue by removing some of the healing duty from us, because healing is the only thing we're efficient at.  In order to balance the enjoyability of the classes, clerics need to be adjusted in such a way that they can solo effectively if they can't find a group, or if they just need a break from the routine.<P>Our undead line is probably the best way to balance the 'fun' factor and give the clerics a break from the traditional mold.  Rangers have the ability to fear and snare animals, so why not add an undead snare to clerics?  <P>Fix our broken spells (Summoned hammers, MoK, Hammer of Faith). Fix the stacking issues. Cleric AC/HP buffs don't stack with Druid group-resist buffs, and this really edges the cleric out somewhat, since the druid can stack all of his buffs together, and the combined effect is better than our few single buffs. <P>I apologize for the length. Thanks for your consistently professional demeanor, Absor, and I hope we can resolve the Hatelist issue as soon as possible.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'd like to address another issue of balance.<P>It has been said that clerics sacrifice utility in exchange for increased specialization in the healing arts.  As a 'pure' class, we know this going in and expect it, but I don't think this is entirely the case, and with the new push toward opening up the endgame to the hybrids, I think that the arguement for specialization is further weakened.<P>Druids and Shamans have had their healing abilities improved, while clerics are in the process of having their healing abilities curbed in the name of overall balance.  You've stated that clerics will always be better healers because of our healing bonus.<P>Does our healing bonus, however, take into account the utility that the other healing classes add to a group (Primarily the pre-50 game, and post-50 if the mobs are retooled to be less resistant and easier to kill)?  Both shamans and druids have the ability to increase their mana regeneration, in some cases allowing a shaman a 25% to 30% greater mana pool over time than any cleric.  Does our healing bonus allow us to heal more in spite of this?<P>A mana gathering ability (Prayer) wouldn't be out of line here.  We have fewer spells than any other 'casting' class.  We have less 'utility' than any other casting class, and we're the only casting class with no ability to augment our mana regeneration. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If VI thought we were balanced and powerful, then why did they nerf.<P>You can't have it both ways.  <P>Thx info.<P>The single biggest question raised by their fiasco is...what ELSE in the world will they examine next for nerfing...maybe they'll discover your left arm is unbalancing and retroactively remove them all.  Then issue a statement saying "we are happy with the changes, we know you will be too".</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000392-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000392.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000392-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000392-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000392-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000392-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum14&number=14&thisthread=000392&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum14&number=14&thisthread=000392&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
