</FONT><HR>You can read the previous discussion here:http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045291.html <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cool.gif"><P>Absor<BR>Station Member   posted 01-05-2001 04:14 PM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>The old threads were getting a bit nasty and were wandering. Let's not have that happen here.<BR>Let me sum up my thoughts on this whole thing.<P>Necromancers are just fine, in all aspects of the game, with one possible exception.<P>On raids they can find a lot to do up to and after the encounter with the boss mob. But in that encounter some necromancers don't feel that they have enough to do, or feel that what they can do isn't what they want to be doing.<P>In this thread I would like to keep to one narrow focus. What things could be done to give necromancers more to do in that one encounter, without improving their power in other situations?<P>It's a very narrow question, and a very hard one to answer. Here are the ideas that I've seen that won't work, or won't happen:<P>DoT stacking: We're probably not going to allow more DoTs to stack than already do. And this would have an impact far beyond the scope here, it would increase the power of necromancers across the board.<P>Unresistable Lifetap: Probably never going to happen. I understand the whole concept of Lifetap to power mana transfer. I'm just telling you with a pretty firm tone, that it's really not likely to happen.<P>Mana Transfer: The rate will probably not be improved. As I've said before, currently necromancers can convert 1 hit point into 1 mana. Right now they can give that 1 mana to a cleric (as an example) for the cost of about 2.5 mana. The cleric can convert that mana into about 2 hit points. That's the right ratio, really. There shouldn't be a time when the amount that can be returned is higher than the amount that is given out.<P>Poofing: with the next patch, this should be pretty much fixed… let me copy one of my other posts:<P>"Ok, this whole thing was Alan getting confused.<P>There was special code put in several months ago that prevented nearly any possibility of a corpse poofing if the NPC is over 54th level. I was right there.<P>But recently, a few weeks ago, we added some code to deal with a unique NPC situation (that I'm not going to go into…) that might have been causing corpses to poof is the kill was assigned to a Link Dead PC over 54th level. This will be changed with the next patch.<P>I was confused and thought that this change was already in.<P>I'm sorry about the confusion.<P>Alan"<P>In any case, let's leave this one off the list until we see how things go post-patch. I have noticed, though, that the only complaint I've seen was about Ragefire… I wouldn't be worried about poofing due to DoTs anymore. At least try it out.<P><BR>Issues that we can discuss:<P>Ignite Bones: I'm willing to suggest some change to remove the skeleton. I think to do that we need to have something that does the same sort of thing, but I don't know what that is. This spell will probably never be changed into a standard direct damage spell. I like some of the ideas (like changing the tinting on the target), but unfortunately most of them don't seem possible technically. I'll keep thinking up ideas. Post any you have here.<P>Group Feign Death: I haven't mentioned this idea to the team yet. I suppose that there might be a lot of reasons not to implement this idea…<P>Making pets immune to fear: This probably won't happen. Then we'd have to do the same for magicians (not an inherently bad thing, but it has broad repercussions), and there's PvP to consider. But I think I have some interesting ideas along these lines that might work out. I want to here other ideas along these lines.<P>Possessing the pet: that's a cute as heck idea (maybe 'cute' is the wrong word…). Another one that I'll mention to the team. But keep in mind that I'm not really looking for totally new stuff. I'm not advocating that we start making up new spells and whole new concepts. It would be hard to justify spending a ton of time making new concepts at this point. But it's certainly interesting…<P>Essence Emerald: I'm kind of in favor of using this device as a way of changing things. It's a very expensive casting cost… For example I kind of liked the idea of allowing the mana transfer spell to be usable on others, considering the cost.<P>Unrelated Issues (meaning that I'm mentioning them here so that you don't have to bring them up…) :<P>I'm aware that Track Corpse doesn't work. I'm going to ask about that.<P>The epic weapon. It's not really related to this anyhow, and I am already very aware how you all feel about it.<P>Defoliate: If someone wants to start a new thread about which things they think should be affected by this spell, go for it. But it's not part of the focus of this thread.<P>I may have missed some…<P>Keep in mind that I understand that many of you are not happy with a support role on raids. I'm fairly convinced that it is perfectly fine for a necromancer to act in that role during the final battle of the raid. But I'm open to ideas (barring the ones that I've already vetoed) that would make them more aggressive at that one final battle.<P>Alan<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I understand the whole concept of Lifetap to power mana transfer. I'm just telling you with a pretty firm tone, that it's really not likely to happen.&gt;&gt;<P>we don't want it to be unresistable, we want it to at least have a chance to land on uber mobs.<P><BR>&lt;&lt;Mana Transfer: The rate will probably not be improved. As I've said before, currently necromancers can convert 1 hit point into 1 mana. Right now they can give that 1 mana to a cleric (as an example) for the cost of about 2.5 mana. The cleric can convert that mana into about 2 hit points. That's the right ratio, really. There shouldn't be a time when the amount that can be returned is higher than the amount that is given out.&gt;&gt;<P>this issue is really about downtime and the speed of recouperating mana, it's not going to kill me with a 3:1 ratio, but to be able to do this 3:1 transfer i need to be able to "have a chance" to tap an unber mob when doing this on an uber raid.<P><BR>&lt;&lt;Issues that we can discuss:<P>Ignite Bones: I'm willing to suggest some change to remove the skeleton.

I like some of the ideas (like changing the tinting on the target), but unfortunately most of them don't seem possible technically. I'll keep thinking up ideas. Post any you have here.&gt;&gt;<P>Anything is possible technically in the gaming industry, it's simply a matter of what you're willing to sit down and do.  My suggestion is to leave it a human brown skeleton but make it large enough so that melee range isn't changed.  I suggest this because i know verant isn't going to make skeletons for every npc in the game.  Even if you take the illusion away, it's still not a regular DD because it reduces str and ac.  I don't think tinting is a good idea, there's just really no need for it.  At least with a human skeleton that changes size to have the same melee range (for the players) as it does in it's regular form is a feasible idea.<P>&lt;&lt;Group Feign Death: I haven't mentioned this idea to the team yet. I suppose that there might be a lot of reasons not to implement this idea…&gt;&gt;<P>group feign death is a good idea, because feign death already isn't very dependable so making it a group spell also won't be very dependable either.  besides the point, for group spells, i suggest group DMF, group disease resist, and group cold resist.<P>&lt;&lt;Making pets immune to fear: This probably won't happen. Then we'd have to do the same for magicians (not an inherently bad thing, but it has broad repercussions), and there's PvP to consider. But I think I have some interesting ideas along these lines that might work out. I want to here other ideas along these lines.&gt;&gt;<P>As i stated in the other post, people who specialize in a certain thing tend to also be resistant to it.  melee's naturally resistant to physical damage (which they are), casters naturally resistant to spells (which they aren't), it's going along the same lines as why Nagafen does fire damage yet is resistant to it as well.  Necros  specialize mostly in disease, poison, and magic based magic (including fear), it makes sense that they should be naturally (though not compeltely overblown) resistant to these types of spells.  mage and shaman pets are not a magic specialized class (mages are fire and cold mostly, and shamans are disease and poison mostly), so there's no need for them to be naturally resistant to magic or fear.<P>&lt;&lt;Possessing the pet: that's a cute as heck idea (maybe 'cute' is the wrong word…). Another one that I'll mention to the team. But keep in mind that I'm not really looking for totally new stuff. I'm not advocating that we start making up new spells and whole new concepts. It would be hard to justify spending a ton of time making new concepts at this point.

It's a very expensive casting cost… For example I kind of liked the idea of allowing the mana transfer spell to be usable on others, considering the cost.&gt;&gt;<P>I only use essence emeralds for Convergence, i will never use trucidation or infusion unless i have an excessive amount of these and an extra spell slot to play with.<P>&lt;&lt;Unrelated Issues (meaning that I'm mentioning them here so that you don't have to bring them up…) :<P>I'm aware that Track Corpse doesn't work. I'm going to ask about that.<P>The epic weapon.

At the very least, let us be able to have a chance to lifetap.  At a more median level, lower the resistances of the uber mobs depending on what they specialize in.  i.e.  fire based uber mobs should be less resistant to poison and disease (so we can dot), Trakanon should be less resistant to fire and cold (so we can dot).  instead, all uber mobs have all resistances through the roof which makes no sense.<P>-Pathogen<BR>54th Heretic<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I will try and add to it if something new is brought<BR>                                up. Please note, the vast majority of the ideas below are NOT mine but rather those of the community at large. I am merely the editor and<BR>                                compiler with one exception.<P>                                Changes fall within several categories<P>                                Lifetap<BR>                                1. If a tap is cast on a mob that is less than six levels above the player, then the tap will check resistance as normal, but always return the full<BR>                                amount of health of the spell to the necromancer even if resisted.<P>                                2. Really a corollary to the above in that it allows partial damage while still returning full health of the spell to the necromancer.<P>2b. Makes Taps irresistable, but nerfs ToN with an increase in recast time.<P>                                Fear<BR>                                3. Provide a fear protection line that allows the necromancer to make the target immune from fear for a time.<P>                                4. Group fear protection--similar to above, perhaps an upgrade if a line is considered.<P>                                5. AoE fear removal spell which would encourage the necromancer to meditate near the fray and cast this spell somewhat regularly to keep all<BR>                                players and pets on target. This spell would need both fast cast and recast times to be effective.<P>                                6. MOB fear elimination spell which, when cast on a critter would prevent it from casting AoE fear for the duration.<P>                                Pets<BR>                                7. Make undead pets immune to AoE fear<P>                                8. Additional control commands<BR>                                a) /no attack--pet will not defend itself<BR>                                b) /sever--kills pet regardless of distance<BR>                                c) /one target--prevents pet from changing targets unless countermanded<P>                                9. Raid-Pets: Max pet per summon, but have very slow movement rates, are immune to fear, and suicide after MOB is killed<P><BR>                                General Grouping<BR>                                10 Ignite Bones--Remove skeleton illusion in favor of a fiery particle effect<P>                                11. Provide a 42 second "splut-like" debuff overtime.<P>                                12. Group DMF<P>                                13. Group Feign Death. I think the general consensus from both necros and non was that this would be interesting to try out on test to see how<BR>                                it worked. Some thought it would get more folks killed than it saved. Given the supposed ease to code, it might be worth a test. My personal<BR>                                note is that the spell would probably need to be all-or-nothing based on the necromancer's save.<P>                                14. Mana-Link--a link similary to shifting site, but cancelable, that allows 80% of the necromancer's mana to immediately channel to the target<BR>                                along with 80% of all mana gained during the duration of the spell. This spell should probably have a relatively long duration, 2-3 mins, but also a<BR>                                very long recast time like 30 mins. Part of the compensation for this restriction should be a better ratio, perhaps 2-1.<P>                                15. Lower level requirement for Conjure Corpse from 57 to 55. Reasoning behind this from the poster is three-fold:<BR>                                a) Summoning corpses is unarguably one of the few things necros do on raids.<P>                                b) Summon Corpse was gained 19 levels before, which is a very long time to wait for an upgrade<P>                                c) Shadow Knights are supposedly getting Summon Corpse at lvl 50 and are far better equiped to carry the heavy coffins than are necromancers.<BR>                                Generally speaking, hybrids do not get a parent class spell until the parent class gets any available upgrades. At lvl 55, necromancers are still 5<BR>                                lvls above the point where their child class gets the upgrade.<P>                                === End Summary ===</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Man, this thread got huge, I've been following it at work since last week. I've got a 51 necromancer...I havent' really been on that many massive raids or anything, but I can see where most of the concern is coming from. As for ideas... there isn't really much you could do and not overpower them in another aspect of the game, such as solo'ing. <P>Although, a lure lifetap series would be pretty nice.. nothing insane.. maybe the 49 lifetap that has a lot longer recast, and takes more mana. <P>Ignite bones is another one. I have used that spell maybe 5 times in total while levelling. I found it pretty useless, dots were more mana efficient, and my evoc sucks. <P>Another plan for pets, they go down pretty quick in huge encounters, maybe set harmshield to be castable on your pet? And also the pathing is pretty bad.. what about a pet buff that will give yer pet a chunk of hp, and root it.. which I'm guessing would only be used in uber encounters. Maybe offset the chunk of hp and root effect with a small stat debuff on it, seen as how it will last longer anyways, and not run around and aggro the zone. <P>Those are my two cents, back to work.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Happy monday!<BR>Just going to give a summary of my ideas since they were buried...<P>1) Reduce the damage of Touch of night to 500 damage -OR- Give it a recast time of 3 minutes (meaning 720 damage every 3 minutes)<BR>2) Remove Trucidation (our highest tap)<BR>3) Make taps irressistable as they were originally designed (or close to it). Meaning if principle 1 & 2 were implemented, a necro could do miniscule damage (320 every 3 second cast, or 500 every 6 second cast). We would not replace wizards, but would be able to tap, meaning we could heal, lich etc, and perform our 2ndary roles.<P>Wizards should do the most damage, but 2 necros should be able to simulate this damage roughly. <P>Absor, you never answered why taps couldn't be made more save friendly. This suggestion would NOT effect day-to-day groups as everything we fight BESIDES uber mobs are already 100% tapable. This would ONLY affect uber mobs, as they are the only creatures with artifical immunities.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Lets look at facts:<P>Fact 1; Taps are NOT resistable AT ALL on 95% of all encounters<BR>Fact 2; Taps damage/mana ratio is bad. It is only decent when you factor in the healing. Chain nuking while full health is mana inefficient<BR>Fact 3; Taps are required to lich and heal others.<BR>Fact 4; With the mana dump spells current ratio, liching is required to do this in order to make it worthwhile for the necro to be on the raid (see fact 3)<BR>Fact 5; Making taps irresistable on uber mobs would only affect that part of the game (see fact 1)<BR>Fact 6; Touch of night (ToN) would be overpowering if Fact 5 became reality, so it must be nerfed, if and only if fact 5 came into play. If taps could be partially resisted, then ToN should be left as is, as a partial resist on 720 is acceptable, a partial resist on 320 would be laughable.<P><BR>These are all facts  Therefore, if the necro is to play a support role then taps must be enabled. It is that simple. It would not affect the other parts of the game.

</FONT><HR>First off, would like a VI response to my thread on Defoliation, which Alan clearly stated someone could start a thread on, and mine has been going for almost 2 weeks now. <P>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/043278.html<P><BR>As for other concerns, lemme start up.<P>I've played a necromancer since day 1 almost, i've been through the nerfs and constant debuffing of the Necromancer class.  Hell, i remember when my 49 pet hit in the mid 60's and all feared a necromancer.<P>Nowadays this isnt the case at all.  Necro's are laughed at, made a laughing stock, and are utterly useless in most major mob encounters now.  I've been turned into a walking manastone (which was taken out of the game, deemed too powerful i guess and no longer drops), A Dead man floating buffer for trakanon (yippie, bout the only raid people want me to buff), and my pet has been nerfed to the point of usefulness (if i wanted a rogue or monk, i'd group one).<P>My suggestions are simple and probally will be highly frowned or rejected totally by Verant.  But I'm willing to try here.<P>First off, Un-nerf Defoliation from PoG. Make the spell useful or change it to something useful. (perhaps a EQUAL disease or poison direct damage spell)<P>Fix Track Corpse, it's been MONTHS since Kunark went live, and this spell is still not working whatsoever.  My suggestion, Make the spell work like this:<P>You begin casting track corpse...<BR>&lt;common ranger/druid/bard tracking window comes up&gt;<BR>&lt;select corpse to track&gt;<BR>your target is to the front and left of you.<P>Should be simple to code, but then again, i'm about the last person to say coding is easy.<P><BR>High Level Damage over Time spells: <P>Okies, in a group situation at level 58, i have a couple nice DoTs to use.  The problem is, the damage is done too slow.  <P>Cessation of Cor, and Envenomed bolt are the only ones worth casting in a group situation.  Problem here, As SOON as i cast these, INSTANT AGGRO, and it takes a good couple of minutes until the tank can taunt it off.  Example:<P>You begin to cast Cessation of Cor...<BR>A frogluk Krup Knight has summoned you<BR>A Frogluk Krup Knight eats you for breakfast.<BR>Loading Please wait...<P>Pyrocuror, Splurt, Plague are utterly useless due to the fact it takes 2 minutes or more for full damage to take place.  Good for soloing yes, but soloing is so much down time, and the exp is horrible at 58. <P> Also, Splurt does not stack with the Enchanter Choke series (Torment of Argil) if the enchanter lands it first, but will stack if casted before the enchanter DoT) Also Splurt doesnt stack with Cessation of Cor. <P><BR>Scent of Terris:<P>Good spell to a degree, but needs to be on the save list for Malo/Tash type spells.  It cant be dispelled or cured i have found out, dunno what even the resist is for this.  A equal 58 necromancer and i tested this.  We broke out our Dragon resist gear and buffed well over 150 each stat, checking to see what the resist might be.  Results? 4 out of 5 landed reguardless of the save which was buffed.  However, seems that any highly Magical resist creature will resist every time.<P>Night time only spells:<BR>Who was the guy who thought up this?  Night only? Whatta crock!  Levant, Quivering Veil of Xarn, Skin of Shadow...  The bards had thier night only songs changed to anytime songs, what about the necros?  Quivering Veil i thought would be such an asset when i reached 58.  Only to find it is night time only, and wont stack on a Druid/shaman's regen spell.<P>Please remove the Night only spells.  If you want to add a night only effect for necros, make some of thier spells do considerablly more damage at night.<P>Feign Death.  Okies, where do i start here.  It's worthless almost now at level 58.  I understand failing FD, "you have fallen to the ground", but when i dont receive a fail message, it STILL fails.  Why did Shadowknights get an improved version at 60, when Shadowknights are Warrior/Necro hybrids?  Been ages since Feign death actually worked when i NEEDED it to.  Only time it seems to work now is if i feign before i engage a mob.<P>Factions, Howling Stones, Kaesora and Karnors:<P>I'm rather disappointed in having to ruin my faction in the only Bank/store in Kunark so i can join friends and such in a group in either zone.  Risk Vs Reward isnt enough in these zones?  And why did the "Good" races not receive zones with major faction hits against Fironia Vie?<P>Other suggestions i saw:<P>Group Feign Death: Wont happen i'm afraid.<P>Group Dead man Floating: I love this suggestion, Would be so much easier buffing for a Trakanon raid.<P>Unresistable Life taps: Wont happen.  However, i would like to see the high level life taps having a Lure chance to hit, and i would even accept partial hits instead of all or nothing here.  And Trudication, due to it's cost, should be 100% unresistable.<P>Other Suggestions: <P>Mages received Summon Monster 1, 2, 3 during SoV.  Would be nice if Necros received Summon Undead Monster 1, 2, 3.  Getting tired of the Skeleton routine day after day, and the Spectre pet isn't really me.  I'd prefer a Ghoul, Zombie, or mummy pet to play around with!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>As i have said, i have played a necromancer since day one, and do *NOT* like being turned into a support class with nothing but DMF and manastone abilities.  Necromancers should be feared, we are evil, we live evil, we play with dead things!  <P>Stonecloud Hellfyre<BR>58 Defiler<BR>Fennin Ro<P>"A Necromancer never dies...

</FONT><HR>I still think the answer is a line if DeBuffs. Not Turgurs or any buff that makes another class unique but something for necros only.<P>Another idea is a Pet Buff that makes them Resistant to Fear and being Teleported but also locks them onto 1 single Mob. Example: On the charge into Traks Lair I stop and cast this spell on Trak, my pet is all over him. The spell makes the pet for Trak only, ie. Trak Dies, the pet dies. Other mobs aggro the necro, pet stays on Trak regardless. Other Mobs aggro the Pet, pet stays on Trak. Trak Gates, Pet Dies. Necro dies pet dies. and maybe even Pet dies, Necro dies. If necro was to die on pet death I would want to see the resists on Fire, Poison, Cold and Disease be increased on the pet dramatically.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1.  I found out, that to land a fire giant with a life tap, u have to be close.  Why can't this be the case for uber mobs?<BR>2.  I was displeased to hear that SK's will get the summon corpse.  It just means that necro's will have a harder time to group at higher lvl dungeons, and competition to get the spell.  Are showdow knights supposed to get everything a necro get?  U want to improve the hybrids, give the paladins and sk duel wield, and weapons to match, but please leave summon corpse out.<BR>3.  Group feign death,  will only upset other, especially when u cast it with a monk in your group.  I think a useless idea.<BR>4.  Group DMF, great idea, reduces time it takes to cast 6 dmfs, and would save on mana.<BR>5.  These spells requiring an essense emerald, i think are a waiste of time.  A lot of us necros would not/ could not ask another to be sacrificed.  I would rather have different spells to replace these.<BR>6.  Pets immune to fear.  No matter what, pet will not be allowed in raids, unless there are no other mobs around that the pet can train back.<BR>7.

</FONT><HR>Pets are the answer =)<P>I made a post on the wishlist too, but here's a way to get necros some variety in pets, and give them something else to do on big raids:<P>Allow/create a necro spell that raises a freshly dead, non-looted corpse up as a pet.  Make the pet work like a charmed pet, IE for a random duration, then have it poof (WITH its loot) when the spell is done.<P>Great RP possibilities, a new look for pets without taking up space in the global tables (by definition, the model for a freshly dead MOB is already in the tables).  There should not hopefully be any tough balance issues with this, since A) players get one pet at a time, B) the players' group has to kill the MOB first, so the necro does not gain a power as strong as the enchanters' charm C) Enchanters can already use any charmable mob in zone already as a pet for a while.<P>For even more possibilities, allow players to converse with the pet as if it's charmed.. so you can kill Entalon in BW for example, then raise him from the dead and question his corpse =)<P>You'd probably limit this to charmable pets, but I think personally a necro should be able to charm a dead Dragon, if his group is willing to give up the loot after going to the effort of killing it =)<P>Liet Spivak   Kindred Spirit Alliance<BR>Ayonae Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First I would like to say I love the group DMF idea!  My guild was in Split-Paw the other night and we DMF/Invis'd our way back to Ishva area and it was great....14 people made it back there with no problems.<BR>As for additional idea's.  How about a targetable invis?  A non-resistable life-tap that uses a gem component....if people use it too much....up the gem...or base the damage on the type of gem....malachit.... 2 damage drain..... diamond...500 damage drain.  I like the idea of a pet buff that makes pet fearless for say a minute with like a 1 hour recast time.  I sort of like the drain-life shield too......as long as we can target our party members.....talk about cool!<BR>Keep an open mind about what people suggest on here.  Simply as the balance team "If we did this spell what should the cost and penalty be to make it unuseable/unaffordable/undesirable for non-raid situations?"<BR>Well those are my thoughts and suggestions.

</FONT><HR>at the very extreme least trucidation shuld be able to be landed on an uber mob.  I would like to see the resists changed so that any mob over say, 30,000 HP was not tottaly magic resistant, they just took partial damage.  Having our one main damage dealing line effectively shut down hurts alot.  I like the suggestion about making our taps have the lure resist rates.  <P>also trak should be flagged as undead, afterall, he is.  Yet we necros and I suppose any cleric that tries can never land expulse undead or any other undead only spell on him.  Changing this would greatly increase our desireability towards him.  <P>As for defoliation, if the mob is a plant flag it as a plant.  A treant is a plant.  A mushroom is a plant.  A succulant is a plant.  Basically take a look at the pictires of the mobs.  If they are not animals, then they need to be flagged plant.<P>all in all, most necros are disappointed at going through 50 levels, which we do with about middle of the road easyness, and then suddenly haveing our role change.  We no longer are a class who deals damage and can do lots of diffrent things even though we do them crappily, we become a class that can no longer deal damage and are simply reduced to mana batteries(which is fine if it is necessary, but I want another option open to fit in with the first 50 levels) or DMF batteries or summon corpse batteries.  This leaves us with a competly diffrent role than we are used to and is unfair.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I have been trying to come up with some ideas on how to improve Necro's Raid desirability, without upping their individual "power".  Here are my ideas: <P>Non Spell Ideas<BR>1.	"Mana Healers" - Seems to be our role in large groups, ok if this is your plan, help us out, make us become effective DURING a fight by being able to see peoples Mana level, ask yourself this... How effective would a cleric be in keeping tanks alive if they had to ask, "Does any tank needed health?".  Timing is the issue with this.<BR>	a.	The New Blue exp bar you guys just added - use the same type of bar to show other player's Mana levels in:<BR>		i.	Group members health bar in your group health window.<BR>		ii.	Your target's health displays so we can help members of another group in large raids<P>2.	Raid Leaders - Enable Necro's to be the "Raid Leader" of a group, of Group Leaders, thus connecting up to 5 groups together so exp communication etc... can be shared by all. This would give Necro's a unique and important role without increasing their individual or solo  "Power"<P>3.	Pets - ideas on new commands to make pets easier to Control in dungeons and on planes, because of pathing problems and agro problems.  Pets are not "Allowed" in most raids and even in some dungeons, ACK!! Big part of our appeal is the power of our pets.<BR>	a.	/pet stay close 5     -       Makes pet stay within 5 grid squares(or however you guys measure distance) from you at all times.  If it strays, or gets left behind, it warps to you, or if that is not acceptable it simply self destructs.  Of course the distance would be adjustable (or not?, /shrug).   Maybe a stack-able item like "Bracelet of Warping"?, "Bracelet of Following"? or some such, can be bought for 2pp each, once a pet is made, it can be handed one of these bracelets, (this could be used by another PC while the /follow command is on, /shrug).<BR>	b.	/pet sit down        -         This command should be changed to make the pet come back to that spot after it is ordered to /pet attack  rather than hanging out where the mob died. <BR>	c.	/pet sleep             -          Makes pet sit and stay sitting NO MATTER WHAT.  Nothing should be added to its agro list while it is in this state.  If while in this state, it is ordered to /pet attack  pet would return to stand at the spot where it was sleeping, after the mob is dead (if it didn't get agro'ed on another mob during the fight).<P>Spell ideas<P>4.	Faerie Fire - Spell that makes target glow neon,  Good for big raids(help tanks) <P>5.	Ignite Bones - take away the graphic? Give us a spell that has the same effects without the graphic? (We are not allowed to use this spell on Raids, tanks think the mob is a pet) Maybe put the faerie fire thing in its place?<P>6.	How about an AE illusion spell that turns all mobs into skellys that are not involved in combat. Like a Mezz spell in that they would stay a skelly till they were hit... btw this would have to stack with Mezz or it would be useless.  A spell like this would do nothing to give us more power but it would make us very valuable on big raids, it would help tanks keep track of the right target and help raid leaders identify those that are disrupting the Mezzes.  A combo of these first 3 ideas would make us well liked and not a bit more <P>7.	Anti Fear Protection - We have a problem with mass pet fearing occurring on raids this makes pets (not just necro pets)undesirable in those situations also.  Some solutions:<BR>	a.	A  magic resistance addition made to pet augment spells (maybe to the shamie buffs too)<BR>	b.	A Fear resist buff added to Necros spell list. This would be a very role-play friendly spell  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> this would also make us desired by other pet classes.  (Heck if not us, give the spell to the Shamies, they could use some buffs that matter) <BR> <BR>8.	Debuff spells - Verant is saying Shamies primary function is Buffing, the Shamies are saying their primary is DE-buffing, hmmm... thought that whole new line of Necro spells (the ones we got after the great pet nurf, (the scent line)) were going to give Necros a De-Buffing role in the group... it didnt happen, maybe add AC and STR debuffs to them?  I know this may cross over into the Enchanters realm but they are usually busy Mezzing and cant afford the mana to De-Buff<P>9.	Mana Spells - We seem to be getting pushed to being "Mana Healers" (Or is it manastones? Hehe) maybe a few more spells along these lines would be in order If that is our lot in life <BR>	a.	How about a "DoT style" mana transfer spell with a better ratio than our current DD type (subversion line)?<BR>	b.	Arch Lich and Demi Lich in the same lvl? Arch has the cool graphic and a lower transfer rate 20mana for 31hp's(basically same as lvl 49 Lich)per tick, Demi has the larger amount of mana transfer, 31mana for 48hp's per tick<BR>		i.	 Demi should be moved to lvl 55 with the ratio of about 25mana for about 39hp's a tick<BR>		ii.	Arch should stay at 60 and have the cool graphic and get the 31mana for 48hp's a tick<BR>	c.	Lifetap Resists and how it hurts us as mana batteries- <BR>		i.	at one time lifetaps were practically unresistable no matter what lvl the mob was, you guys were right to nurf this (200 lvl 20 Necros could kill a dragon, hehe) <BR>		ii.	BUT, it would be nice if some measure of the old resist rate was brought back so we can heal ourselves on raids, at this time MOST Uber mobs, plains or otherwise resist the heck out of our taps.  <BR>		iii.	All I really want is to be able to cast the Tap-DoT line on these guys to be able to keep Lich up to help the Cleric and Enchanters with mana, heck the dmg part doesn't stack anyway because it is a DoT but all the Necro's in a Raid could keep ourselves healed if we could get those to stick.  As it stands those healers are having to expend valuable mana that I am feeding him to heal me! So what good am I doing even feeding him with Lich on  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> So I have to bug the Enchanters for C2 and drain their mana a little  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P><BR>Here are some added ideas, yes I know these stray from the group benefit theme, they may even cause Necros to gain "Power", so I am putting these in a separate list... <BR>10.	Skely form (Lich type spells) - <BR>	a.	I THINK it would look better to JUST change the head graphic to skelly form for the Lich series so that our robes and other stuff stays the same as usual!! This would look really Cool! Better than the currant  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>	b.	Why is it that Enchanters get a Skely illusion that makes them invis to undead but our Lich series does not have this effect? The first opinion about the head graphic thing would go a long way to making this a non issue since they would then look  different than us <P>11.	 Masters of Undead? - I go to EC at lvl 51 and get attacked by a lvl 8 Skely!! Masters of What?  At least we should be treated by all (non faction connected) undead just as Druids are to Bears and Wolves.  Makes since to me, they just con amiable to us like the ghouls in the Necro Guild in Neriak<P>12.	Necro Pet Weapons - does giving a Necro pet a weapon do anything anymore? Ideas...<BR>	a.	Maybe make a special stackable dagger (kind of like Enchanter's tiny daggers) that we can give our pets and it would increase speed and dmg a certain set amount. Not to much, just enough to make up for no decent low OR mid range focus item heck for that matter I don't know an High lvls with the item either  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>13.

</FONT><HR>Hmm...<P>1) Group feign death<BR>2) Group DMF<BR>3) Let necros "possess" their pets.  A buffed up level 55ish necro is gonna have about 900ish hp's (w/o other classes buffs).  His pet will have considerably more, but remember, a necros manna and hp's interact with each other anyway.  If a necro can "become" his pet, he'll forfeit those 900 hp's along with the other 500-800 a cleric/shammy could give him.<P>Programatically, (3) would be kinda easy -- make the caster create a pet, then when the necro casts the spell (it should be a level 52ish spell), make the pet poof and raise the necro's stats accordingly.  At that point, the necro can't cast a pet or charm anything (that code is already in place).  Basically, between the necro and the pet, around 900ish hp's will be lost (the original necro's points).  Furthermore, the necro's casting ability will be severly hindered since now, he's gonna get beaten on unless something else is taunting the mob off him.<P>Now assess the impact of implementing (3) in the game.  If a necro is soloing, he's NEVER gonna use that spell because we like having two independent "pools" of hit points.  Furthermore, our spells take so long to cast that we need the pet as a distraction in solo operation.  But now consider the impact in a group setting...  We get into Chardok, where pathing is nightmarishly bad, and the necro simply "becomes" his pet.  Give him necro pet damage appropriate to the pet he could cast on his own -- nothing more -- nothing special.  You should probably not even let him wield weapons, since pets at level 39 and above auto duel wield anyway.<P>Now consider the benefit to Verant:<P>1) Necros take a MAJOR step back into viability<BR>2) Possession is entirely consistant with a necro's mode of operation<BR>3) Possessed pets can be like Lich form, KOS to soooo many guards<BR>4) VERANT DOESN'T HAVE TO REDO 100% OF ITS PATHING CODE IN DUNGEONS  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Ooooooh... that would make me pull my 54 necro out of retirement sooooo fast  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>   If the necro possesses the pet, he becomes the pet, sort of like Bind Sight, leaving his (vulnerable and unmoving) body behind.  No casting allowed from the pet.  That niftily solves the problem of bad pathing in uber-encounters (where everyone says all the necro spells are useless anyway), without increasing solo power.  It would not be nearly as good an idea if the "possession" were just an uber AC/HP buff for the necro.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

NO I didnt read 100 Pages (exaderation) of posts, but I need want to share this with you as I have been reading over the last few days and am disgusted. <P>WHO Are you people. What the heck are you talking about Necro's dont have enough to do. Your Bored? <P>Try being the ONLY Necro on a Big Raid. Then you come tell me we cant help out or arent useful in the Final Mob Fight. Do you know how talented you have to be to mana dump 3 Clerics, 2 Chanters, Maybe another caster class or 2, And support heal 2 tanks at the same time (If your unlucky enough to be in that situation, And yes I have done all of that at the same time and LOVE it.)<P>Thats a heck of alot to do. And very exciting too. Now, where you gonna find the mana to DOT? Believe me, the mobs not gonna last long enough. And that chanter or cleric having ALL your mana may save the entire raid and 3 hour Corpse Recoveries. <P>Now, I have seen this happen way to often and veterans of EQ can not deny it. EVERY TIME, not once in a while or every other time.... BUT EVERY TIME some Necro thinks he should be better and flames Verant about it, Verant looks into it and finds that, WAIT... OOPS we missed somthing, your more powerful than we intended... NERF CITY BABY. And then you cry more. "How Dare you Nerf us", well you ASKED for it. <P>LEARN TO LIKE what you got or your gonna lose something. And if people remember, in the first thread about this, Absor made a statement along the lines of out Lich spell is not draining our health at the proper rate. We are getting the full benefit of mana exchange at the 2/3 damage rate. Luckily he said he did not expect a change anytime soon. If they do, Better go find more HP gear people. Cause Guess what, You may start Dying more on these raids cause your liching to fast and your Lifetaps are gonna be resisted and your cleric is OOM cause you decided to try and NUKE or DOT stack the MOB.<P>Just my 2cp.

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I appreciate you taking the time to investigate necromancer issues.  I understand you're probably very frustrated by now with all the restates, bickering, and outlandish requests, etc that have consumed these threads.  I hope you wont let it color your opinions and affect your willingness to resolve these issues to everyone's satisfaction.  I will admit to some apprehension at a certain tone you have in these threads, a tone that was lacking in the shaman ones.<P>But, to wit:<P>The lifetaps that you're checking in to are assuredly on a different resist table.  Many, many necro spells are on the magic resist table (Invoke Fear, Darkness lines, Screaming Terror, etc), and are resisted quite frequently by mobs that *never* resist taps.  And then, as has been stated ad nauseum by my fellow Necromancers, we run into the so called ubermob, and lifetaps are resisted 100% of the time.<P>Since it was your goal to possibly improve necro performance in uber encounters without giving us additional power elsewhere (which I agree with 100%), the modification of tap resist seems to make the most sense.  Yes, I know you said you felt strongly this would not happen.  I'm just urging you to reconsider.  The other helpful item would be the oft mentioned removal (replacement with some other effect) of the skeletal illusion conferred upon a successful landing of Chill/Ignite bones.<P>Absor, we don't need anything else.  We don't need better mana pump rates, we don't need group feign death, and sorry guys, we don't NEED group DMF.<P>A final comment, I've seen a few posts now talking about how important a necro can be on an uber raid.  And that's just the point, Absor.  A necro.  One.  To do the DMF buffs, to do the summons, and during, to support a cleric and a chanter or two.<P>I'd just like to see where multiple necros can play viable roles in these encounters.. not just one.<P>Thanks for your time.<P>Amondar<BR>54 Heretic<BR>The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yeah taps have to be on some sort of special resist table, or flagged or something.  Many uber mobs can be hit fine by 'magic' just not taps.  Also, like Zzr said, most stuff in the game is 100% tappable all the time, how does putting uber mobs back this way unbalance anything?<P>Sayleth</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>BTW:<BR>- Mag has NO cold spells.<BR>- Mag is Fire and Magic (swords line of spells) only.<BR>- Mag pets are not fear resistant.<P>- Nec are not the only class with Fear (lots have it except Mag). Nec main class of damaga is deasease and posion (sure make your pets have higher (not complete) restistant to deasease and posion.<P>- In raids Necs just dont like what it is they have to do (guess what neither do a lot of classes). At least they have more going for them on raids then a Mag class (ds which is easly covered by druids and druids have evac, heal, buffs, sow,....).<P>Lets change this to what can be done for the Mag class to make them better on raids.. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Amondar -<P>There was a post _ages_ ago about resist checks... that a spell can have a positive or negative modifier in addition to the type of resist.<P>So it's possible that Fear is a +0 modifier and is easy to resist by MobX, while Lifetap series may have a -20, -50, or -100 modifier on the resist check.<P>Now, if there are magic-based spells which _do_ stick when lifetaps don't, that would be odd. Possible exception being a few unresistable spells such as Tashania spells (and even "unresistable may consist of simply a HUGE negative resist check) and the shaman disease debuff.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My thoughts on Necromancers are simple.  We are the masters of DOTs & Lifetaps. <P>Therefore instead of throwing out bones (the other DD's the verant has given us), just take them back and give a chance for Lifetap to land on the big mobs. <P>Lure Line (not a wizzie so don't know much about this) should do more damage and be more efficent.  I don't want to upset the wizzies nor take their place.  Just allow the Lifetap line to hit like the Lure Line does. <P>You've been throwing us bones in every expansion, but really aren't making the necros very viable on big raids.  <P>Thanks for the new pets...when/if those few  of us can EVER find them.  <P>(The worst part of being a necro is to be UNABLE to find your 56 and 59 lvl pets) <P>Christopher <P>And I mean a big /rude on the rarity of the 56 and 59 pets.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045777-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045777-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045777-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045777-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045777-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045777-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=045777&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=045777&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
