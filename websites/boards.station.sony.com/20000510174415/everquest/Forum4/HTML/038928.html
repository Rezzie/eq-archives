&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Well, tonight I took my level 10 Iksar monk into the legendary Tower of Kurn, in the Field of Bone. I knew to expect much danger, as the undead there were many levels above me, but I asked around in FoB if anyone wanted to join me in a group to fight in the tower. Many were scared, but I got a few people to come. 2 Monks, a Warrior, a Shaman, and myself. We started picking off the front stuff, and moved to a room between 2 sets of curving stairs. This room provided a good central location for pulling. We were pulling from the 2 staircases, down the hall, from the main room, and a bit from up the stairs. I have become very god at this. As Leader, and as I had been there a few hours earlier doing the same type of thing with some other folks, I knew that little area pretty well, and my group trusted me. We pulled and killed and killed, many mobs, very fast battles, lots of melee, and well times heals by our shaman. (Regen rocks. But I suppose it only makes up for our EXP penalty). <P>Anyway, I have pulled most everything in sight, and move up the top of the stairs where I find a few weak undead. I tell my group that maybe we should hunt upstairs. I lead them up the stairs, onto a catwalk. We walk forward, and come to another set of stairs, so i tell them to wait and I would scout. <P>I walk up the staircase, mindful that we could start a train if we don't worry about what's behind us, and find quite a few undead up top. I lead my group on, and we decide we will "camp" on those steps. (We are all so used to camping, we assumed we'd just sit there, pull to the stairs, and spend all night doing that.) Well, we killed a few undead, pulled individually, and we started noticing something about this tower: the Undead in it have a reduced aggro range as what I've seen before. Skeletons ten feet away from eachother would not be pulled in pairs, but rather, one at a time. We cleared a few more, then decided, what the heck, lets continue up the stairs. We watched the spawn below us, and had to clear out some of the undead below from time to time, but we pressed on, and moved foward, up the tower. Killing undead that was all yellow or red to our group, we made lots of xp (about half a levels worth in the couple hours there) and moved ever up the stair case, ever up the tower, knowing at any minute we may get trained and die horrible deaths. It was excited to look around the corner and see a skeleton, then pull it and kill it, only to move ahead. <P>Anyway, we made it close to the top, too worried to go much further when we started getting some really tough enemies (Lesser Ice bones. level 18ish. A bit too tough for us) So we decided to head back down the tower, though we vowed to come back again one day. <P>So why is this so much different from other times in EQ? This experience in the Tower of Kurn was not a Campfest, it was a true dungeon crawl. It was gaming as I envisioned it back when i got this game, it was D&D style adventure, "You move forward, you open an old door, and 3 skeletons stand waiting inside!" We did that, and it felt like an adventure. We felt like we had done something. The xp seemed to come fast because what we were doing was FUN, not sitting waiting for a pull for 5 hours. We saw a whole dungeon with our own eyes. We got no special loot, and probably could have made the same XP sitting below pulling, but we explored, adventured, had tons of fun, were nervous about dying, but always a bit certain we could make it just that little bit further.<P>Why is this dungeon so well designed? I have come up with some reasons.<P>1) Pathing is very well done. Mobs don't get stuck, they follow you. They always get you. Makes pulling a joy, fewer worries. <P>2) The aggro range is definately reduced from what i am used to. I PRAY this is not a bug. We were able to rest in a small area, waiting to recover out strength, then press forward, not kill the same exact spawn a million times. We moved up an ancient undead tower. It was wonderful. We knew the undead were aggro, but we could also feel somewhat secure that pulling one mob would not get us a huge train of all the skeles in the tower. <P>3) Spawn time. There was enough time between spawns that we could secure an area, rest up, and move ahead without getting attacked from behind. If we kept moving we could keep ahead of the spawn, which is how it should be. It's more realistic. Nothing wrong with going back down and finding it repoped, but it shoulnd't reappear riught on top of you. <P>4) The level range. Everything we met going to the top was in our range. My experience is finding  room in a certain range, really forcing people to sit around there, as everything else gives poor xp, or is way to tough. But in Kurn, all the way up, we had few changes in power. Greater Skels, and Greater scalebones, with the rare Lesser Ice Bone, which we avoided. we did not go up one level only to find we could go no further. <P>This dungeon is wonderful, and I must say I think Verant has really done something remarkable here. It all fits together. You have made a dungeon we can move around in, move forward, explore, discover, conquer. <P>I went on an adventure tonight, like no other i've had in eq. <P>Now, just in case Abashi reads this, please tell me the aggro range of the undead here is planned? please tell me this tower was designed this way, and that you won't suddenly feel you need to up the aggro range. We weren't powerleveling in there, we weren't exploiting, and we weren't farming any loot. We were just slowly creeping forward in a dungeon, the way it's supposed to work. <P>Thanks for a job VERY well done. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Thanks for telling the story.  It's nice to read these once in a while, and also nice to hear about people "doing" dungeons. <P>The aggro range is what it is due to the design of the tower.  It makes the dungeon a little bit easier than we would like, but increasing it causes some really nasty trains.  <P>-Gordon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR> I have to agree with this post.. I have hunted a few time here myself. Let me tell you besides the tower just being impressive it is an awsome dungeon, some of the best times I have had in Kunark has been here.. Kudos to Verant for this dungeon it is alot better than Befallen or unrest and I cannot wait to be able to higher in it...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I went on a dungeon raid a few hrs I got Kunark the other day.  We did the Sarnak fortress in Lake of Ill Omen and it was a lot of fun.  If you rested to long anywhere the mobs started tracking to your location which forced you to kill them and move on or leave. Going by cons I would say this dungeon is about 25-35 up to the part we explored (I am 32) as everything was green or blue to me.  <P>We had a few good hrs in there until we hit 1 room and just become swamped and our mage and myself died.  <P>But those few hrs were the most fun I have had in EQ in several weeks. <P>Now PAW is a dungeaon that they had plans for that just blew up in their faces.  Very rare to see more than 1 group in there during peak imes as it is just train central.  If you have ever seen 15 gnolls run past you all screaming for blood then returning and destroying you in seconds you will know what I mean.  The place is a death-trap.  They should have left it as it was and maybe increased loot a little bit instead of making the dungeon 30+...at least Brad admitted their mistake with that. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I've found that Paw (since the change in december) is another dungeon that can be 'done' if you have a good group, especially crowd control. The gnolls vary from mid 20's up to around 35 for the common spawns, and the named spawns are around 40. I should think that a group that averaged in the mid to high 30's could clean up the place if they were good, getting xp off 2/3 the gnolls.<P>The only problems with doing Paw, are the low spawn time, and the absolute necessity of crowd control. <P>Several weeks ago, nine members of Falcon's Pride, including myself, decided that the paw gnolls had to be broken. We split into two groups. We had levels ranging from 29-40. We had 3 warriors, 2 shamen, 2 druids, and 2 mages. We fought our way to the Verishe Mal Judges and Executioners without to much trouble. The judges were tough to bring down as we had a difficult time pulling only one, and they would heal each other. After about 3 spawn cycles, we had it broken well enough that we could continue past them to a safe spot.<P>The druids had a named gnoll on tracking, so we rested up and moved on his position. The pull did not go so well. The gnolls in this room all went aggro as soon as the puller stepped inside. Not expecting to get so many at once, we were quickly overwhelmed. The healers attempts to keep the tanks alive only served to alert the guardians of the need to kill them first. There were too many, I could not taunt enough of the gnolls to keep my friends alive, and we all perished. Corpse retrieval took much effort and we had to call on the resources of the Pride to fight our way back to our bodies. It was a glorious adventure, completely devoid of loot or xp (negative for most of us).<P>Of course, our resident layabout bard came waltzing up to where we were resting for the final evac after retrieving our bodies, wondering why we didn't just send someone in invis to corpse drag. (DOH!) We had heard and believed that all the caster gnolls could see invis, you see, and didn't bother to check.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>After all was said and done we had a great time, though I will be unlikely to convince anyone to return now that most of my guildmates are exploring the new lands of Kunark.<P>Olav Skulcrusher<BR>Barbarian Warrior of 36 crushed skulls<BR>Falcon's Pride<BR>The Nameless<P>PS  For a flash movie of the evening, check out our web page at http://members.home.net/turnertribe/falconspride/frames.html<BR>look under the gallery section  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I am glad to hear that Verant learned from their mistake with PAW &lt;To many mobs to close together with to large of aggro radius&gt;.  There is simply no way that the targeted level range can successfully move through that dungeon without casuing MAD trains.  Even people above the approprate lvl range have a very difficult time due to the above stated reasons.  Basically PAW as it is now is a waist of time and experiance and I for one wish Verant would fix it.  It is just a simple matter proper mob placement and their aggro levels.  I have only been to PAW once after the upgrade most everything coned green and it was a horrible experiance.  I enjoyed it when I was lower lvl before the upgrade.  The zone was full at that time.  Now people just camp the outside of the zone or the very enterance.  ROFL</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>My friend and I had a similar experience with Kurn's Tower.  We arrived in FoB when we were both level 16.  I am a warrior and he a Shaman (both Barbarians).  When we first arrived there were few people there (about 10 on /who and only saw like 2 other people the whole time).  We explored the entire upper section slowly progressing forward....chipping away little by little.  It was not easy but not a deathtrap.  It was FUN!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>We got to the top of the tower where we can not find anything new.  Then we went down stairs to kill furballs (Burnyai).  This was much more difficult but we still managed to explore.<P>We both managed to get to level 18 solely while fighting in Kurn's and have completely explored (as far as we know) the entire dungeon with 3 Iksar friends (from upstairs/downstairs/basement).  This has taken us 3 very full days of adventuring.  I loved EVERY second of it.<P>I died twice over the 3 days.  The second time I died pretty far in the basement.  I had to retrieve my corpse with my shsman friend.  It was VERY slow but VERY exciting.  It was the most fun corpse retrieval I have ever done hehe.  After retrieving my corpse we managed to find the 3 iksar down there already and finished exploring.<P>Fantastic job on the dungeon Verant. Definitely my best EQ experience in a year (and all of Kunark...I love it).  It was also the best experience for the other 4 members in our group )<P>Donvanlot<BR>Prexus<P>I'm will never leave Kunark!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Aye, I love the place.  So far the best designed dungeon I'ver played in so far.  I understand the low aggro as there are a few bugs in pathing, such as if you pull a skell through the entrance and he's not in meelee range, he turns around and runs a big ol circle around the room before finally coming out to you.  In the average dungeon he would have picked up every mob in the place by time he reached my party.  Instead, I was able to tag a mob on the top floor and quickly dodge and run down to the the exit. The skell ran all the way down to my waiting party without picking up a single friend.<P>Now if only I could find the damn "Fists of Talon" for my monk's quest...so far nobody has found em yet(at least not confirmed).  Spending a week in a green dungeon is not my ranger's idea of fun.(well is stopped being fun after the second day)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Viking885 I am so envious of you and the others here I almost want to go throw myself at a Hill Giant. Sounds like a BLAST and very sorry I have not yet had a chance like it. I have a 6th lvl Iskar Necro that is going to be looking hard for a group soon though.

</FONT><HR><BR>Ahh!<BR>An adventure in the grand old style!<BR>It sounds to me your group had a blast, perhaps if the servers were not so crowded, this would be possible in many other dungeons.<P>From my experience, it is possible to do this type of adventure in the revamped paw since it is usually not very crowded.  Our group made it all the way down to a named Gnoll, I cant seem to remember his name, I guess I am still suffering ill effects from the encounter..  Him and his friends were rather nasty!<P>I am glad to see this is the type of thing Verant likes to see  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Count me as one of the people who love how Kurn's Tower is laid out. Like has been said many times, it felt like a true dungeon crawl, and few things were as fun as storming into the place room by room, and better yet, there wasn't just 'one path' to go through which made places like Befallen a 'one party only' dungeon.<P>Fantastic!

</FONT><HR>good story and it gives me hope. This is one of the things I loved about Asherons Call game is for once I was actually able to dungeon crawl and it was and is a blast! Looking forward to experiencing that dungeon and other kunark ones. Please tell me there are several dungeons there one of the reasons I still play AC as well as EQ is the fact that AC is the better "dungeons & dragons game" and the world is huge, while EQ is better at chatting in.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=038928&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=038928&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
