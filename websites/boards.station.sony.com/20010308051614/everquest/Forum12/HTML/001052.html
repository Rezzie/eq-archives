</FONT><HR>Recently, Absor responded to the following:<P>&gt;”Whatever happened to the suggestions for self-only ports to a few select locations...<P>Absor:<P>"Teleportation is not part of the Necromancer package..."<P>I submit to Absor and the whole necromancer community that the father of necromancy Miragul did extensive research on personal teleportation and successfully managed to do it. Check out the following excerpt from EverQuest: The Official Players Guide (c) 1998, page 18:<P>"Necromancy, more than any other art, became Miragul's obsession. Eventually he discovered a means by which to creat portals within his own plane and made them to travel great distances in mere seconds..."<P>This is clear cut evidence that teleports *are* part of historical necromancy. It can no longer be shrugged off or denied.<P>Also, necromancers are given the following spells that demonstrate a capability to teleport:<P>Shadow Step - lvl 8 - mini random self teleport<P>Levant - lvl 55 - self only teleport to safe point in zone<P>So folks, there is a basis for giving more teleport cabability to necromancers. I also believe that this inherent capability which is historically supported could be used to make us more group friendly at higher levels. I suggested in both the official "talk" thread and the "list" thread the following 2 new spells:<P>Portal of Tears - lvl 53 - evacs party to spectre island in OOT, dangerous in the fact that party will probably be attacked by spectres upon arrival, also this zone is considered remote, no way to zone out without gate or boat travel<P>Portal of Sand - lvl 60 - evacs party to spectre tower in Oasis, dangerous as well because of spectres on island.<P>The addition of these 2 new spells would not increase the power of a necromancer to gain experience rather would help make us group friendly at a time in a necromancers career when pumping mana is all we seem to be good for.<P> Dornette<BR> 54 necromaner<BR> The Nameless<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I for one think this is just rediculous.  First off, Necromancers are more group friendly than Wizards.  And now you want to give them Evac's? (dosn't matter how unsafe they are)  Wizard's already have to compete with Druids in this area.  To give another class that is more group friendly Evac's as well would just put wizards out of the picture even more.  <P>At the lvl's that you are sudgesting putting these Evac's, You would have to have less than a bubble of health to not be able to get away or deal with the Specs.  Making these not really that unsafe, but alittle bumpy on landing. <P>If your going to ask them to give Necromancers Portals, well then tell them to give Wizards pets :b.  I  mean they gave druids pets.  Asking for them to give Necromancers Portals has as much chance as us Wizards always asking for pets.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

You're telling me that wizards are now competing with druids for the ability to evac? I've played this game for 2 years and I have not once seen a wizard say /auc selling evacs, send tell.

</FONT><HR>Miragul was NOT porting as a necromancer.  The background in this guy was a knowlege-crazed individual.<P>He started out with 3 separate identities to study the different schools of magic (necromancy still unknown to Erudites at this time).  He lived for knowledge and power alone.<P>Soon, he discovered a band of Erudites secretly studying the arts of necromancy that the Dark Elves possesed and joined with them under a 4th persona (none of the others realized he was in fact 4 people at this time).  He joined with them to learn these dark arts, he never abandoned all his accumulated knowledge, quite the opposite.<P>Miragul was first and foremost enchanter/wizard/magician.  Necromancy was next to each of these.  His true interest in necromancy was to extend his life so that he could pursue his studies indefinately.  If you read up on the lore, you will see that he was sucessful in making himself immortal, but failed to contain his desires and ambition in his now undead form.<P>He is a Lich as he lost all his memmories, ambitions, and intellect on his transformation, all that is left is his power.<P>=============================================<BR>Dornette, no offense, but you are essentially saying that becuase he studdied necromancy, that he forgot all he had learned.  If you had not ridden a bike for a few years, wouldn't you still be able to hop on one and ride?<P>Wizards are defined on two things: direct damage, and teleportation.  We give up nearly all else to this end as we are supposed to be the masters of each.  Currently druid have better ports, and at times, cleric, mages, druids, and shaman all have better DD.  If you want a life-tap/dot upgrade, I would support you, but you can't take a significant ability of another class just becuase it would be nice to have.<P>Note: Wizard teleport as not only to spires, pads, and pyramids.  These act as focal points only, making it easier to travel to, and as such, availible to wizards of lesser abilities.  At higher levels, spires/pyramids are not always even used.  Marker's Relocation (EJ), Abscond, Evacuate, and Tishan's Relocation (not 100percent sure, there is NO way I am evacing a party into Skyfire) are all examples of this.  I suppose the new translocate spell could be considered a form of this as well.<P>Come up with ideas in line with your own class definition please and you may see some support here.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

So when you Necro attends training at the Wizardary centers then you can learn to Port.<P>"God knows we have a truckload of absolute useless spells that I would trade in a heartbeat for something usefull like an evac or self teleport to an undead location."<P>Ohh.. Trust me I agree.  The person that designed our 50th+ level spells needs his head examined but Ports are not in our realm.  Just because one NPC [who attended all FOUR schools of magic] was able to does not mean that a Necro should.<P>"If this game is to evolve we need start thinking out the the box."<P>Umm...

</FONT><HR>Trolls and flamers:<P>I have not asked for necromancers to be given the exact same ability to teleport that druids and wizards have. I asked for the ability to teleport, gate, evac...whatever you want to call it in a limited form. I suggested 2 spells that would help our usefullness in groups evacs to undead locations where spectres spawn. That is all. Spells that are perfectly in character with necromancers and in character with the undead.<P>Let's talk about the process of magical transportation and the classes that get this ability:<P>Gate<P>Druids, Clerics, Shaman, Wizards, Mages, Enchanters, Necromancers<P><BR>Shadow Step<P>Necromancers, shadowknights, Wizards<P><BR>Teleport Self<P>Druids, Wizards<P><BR>Evacs<P>Druids, Wizards<P><BR>Self evac in zone <P>Druids, Necromancers (nite only)<P><BR>Summon Player in group<P>Mages<P><BR>Send player to bind point<P>Wizard<P><BR>Therefore the magical ability to transport players is not just limited to druids and wizards alone. As I have stated in previous posts necromancers get 3 spells which enable this to happen. So it is in character for necromancers to be able to get some new spell that would enable use to be more usefull in groups. That is what I'm trying to accomplish here. <P><BR>Azlinon said:<P>"Wizards are defined on two things: direct damage, and teleportation. We give up nearly all else to this end as we are supposed to be the masters of each. Currently druid have better ports, and at times, cleric, mages, druids, and shaman all have better DD."<BR> <BR>I have not asked for necromancers to be given the exact same ability to teleport that druids and wizards have. I asked for the ability to teleport, gate, evac...whatever you want to call it in a limited form. Using the world teleport in the subject line was a mistake however I admit but was not my intention of confusion.<P>Are wizards masters of dd or masters of dd and teleportation? Is every class allowed to be a master of 2 things? Currently necromancers are supposed to be masters of life-taps but since we can't even tab uber mobs I suppose we are not. So what are we then masters of?<P>Did I ask that necromancers be masters of teleportation? No I did not. I just asked given the historical significance of Miragul and necromancy to give some consideration for some new spells that would help us be usefull in groups. Is that such a crime?<P>"If you want a life-tap/dot upgrade, I would support you, but you can't take a significant ability of another class just becuase it would be nice to have."<P>I don't want to "take" your abilities from you. Necromancers supposedly being masters of the undead (tm) should have a way to either self only evac to a few dangerous undead locations or group evac to these same locations. This would not adversely affect wizards at all. Making a necromancer at high lvls post 50 is my only concern here.<P>"Come up with ideas in line with your own class definition please and you may see some support here."<P>Do a search on my name and see what I've posted. I have tried to make a postitive contribution to the necromancer class. I also support many other classes in my posts. Check the official necromancer class talk and list thread. I posted my suggestions in each of those threads I spent about 4 hours working on them. I covered every aspect of the necromancer only to be ignored by Absor and Verant.<P>And by the way, wizards don't "own" the idea of "magically" transporting players or groups around. Just as warriors don't own phyical damage or clerics don't own healing. Yes I do believe that necromancers have a historical legacy and have current spells on the books that give us legitamacy for looking at expanding that ability further. <P>Briljin said:<P>Umm... And ports are 'thinking outside the box"? Funny but I see nothing new or original about them...<P>I stated above that using the world "teleports" was a mistake as it confuses the ability to magical tranport a player or group of players to another location. Thanks for that parting shot, please direct me to your brilliant freah ideas on improving the necromancers usefullness in groups. I will be most happy to critique them for you. <P>Here are the 2 spells I suggested:<P>Portal of Tears - lvl 53 - evacs party to spectre island in OOT, dangerous in the fact that party will probably be attacked by spectres upon arrival, also this zone is considered remote, no way to zone out without gate or boat travel<P>Portal of Sand - lvl 60 - evacs party to spectre tower in Oasis, dangerous as well because of spectres on island.<P>I think these 2 spells are in completely in character with necromancers and should be available in self only versions as well. Sadly their is a resistance to new ideas and new spells on this board if necromancers are the beneficiaries. <P>My goal here is for the necromancer to be useful in groups. Thanks to Verant for nerfing us and not giving us anything useful to contribute in groups except pumping mana post lvl 50. So I am here pleading for some new spells. Druids just received pets, Shamans just got an illusion, yet the sky hasn't fallen on Norrath yet.<P> Dornette<BR> 54 necromancer<BR> The Nameless<P>"Necromancy, more than any other art, became Miragul's obsession.

What does nature have to do with porting not a thing. I say give necro's self ports hell there are enough undead ruins out there."<P>In mythology Druids were able to teleport.  Dont remember the particulars but it was definitely one of their abilities so there is a rationale that makes much more sense for druids to have ports than necros.  <P>As for necros having ports thats simply not fair.  If you think about it they already have a version of just about every class defining spell in the game even if it is hard to get or use.  They get clerics rez (and there are plenty of people out there who will sell their exp to make an essence emerald), they get pets that are as strong as mages, they get manaregen thats faster than clarity II and with lifetaps and lifetap dots they dont even lose their hp.  Just about the only thing they dont have thats from another class is the wizards teleports so leave it be you're already stepping on everyone's toes as it is.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ragnarok97 said:<P>"In mythology Druids were able to teleport"<P>Who's mythology? Planet earth?<P>"They get clerics rez (and there are plenty of people out there who will sell their exp to make an essence emerald)"<P>You have got to be kidding. You have to be lvl 46+ to be "sacrificed" in order to get the Essence Emerald which is then used with another component to "res" someone. I've never ever received a tell from someone who's asked me to sacrifice them and I would never pay them 1000pp or more to do it. Who in their right mind except someone about to quit would allow themselves to be sacrificed? This is an ability that necros never wanted and that necros never use. Don't compare it to a clerics res.<P>"they get pets that are as strong as mages"<P>Here's another lie. Mage pets can easily own any of our 49+ pets. Besides have you seen the mage uber pet? He's a combination of all 4 pets casts all the spells and hits like mad for 67 damage.<P>"they get manaregen thats faster than clarity II and with lifetaps and lifetap dots they dont even lose their hp"<P>Yeah Lich which is about to be NERFED. Lich which drains our HPs (I have been killed by this many times). Lich which makes us KOS. Ever seen someone with clarity on attacked by guards because they have clarity on? Of course not. Lich that can only be casted on ourselves. Lich which lets us feed mana to classes that can actually participate and do something useful on raids. Gimme a break!<P>Regarding lifetaps, that's the only thing we can do well and now we can't even lifetap the new uber mobs.<P>Take your "necros are god class" propaganda somewhere else buddy.<P> Dornette<BR> 54 necromancer<BR> The Nameless<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Youre always going to have someone post in a thread like this that A: Doesnt know squat about Necros, B: Spouts off all sorts of envy gibberish about the Necros, C: Wants to turn the whole thread into a flame war instead of a simple discussion.<P>Personally, I dont think Necros should get ports. Let the Wizzies and Dro01Dz have their ports. We have bigger problems that need taken care of, and the last thing I want to see is a bunch of nonsensical misunderstandings of how the Necro class works from people who have never played the class.<P>I support all Wizard, Mage, and Enchanter requests.

</FONT><HR>Well personally I play 3 casters a necro, a wiz, and a chanter.  Personally I can speak on this from a necro and a wiz point of view. <P>First of all yes wiz are the master of tp as well as DD so you have no arguement with that from me. Now as far as my necro I can't see them giving the necro ports true we have gate but hey everyone that can cast any type of spell can gate except melee types. So its not fair to use that as an excuse to give us ports. Thats kinda like give Shm ports cause they think they are a large race druid just doesnt mix.<P>In my personal opion why not try to get use better pets or a better ratio on hp mana xfer. Beside's when I'm playing my wiz it kinda gets on my nerves when i keep geting tells about a tp. I love my necro and I love to solo with him. We need to get our class back on the top of the solo list and get away from all this grouping in the way crap.<P>So let's get upgrades where they count on the DOT's, the few DD's we have, the hp mana xfer so our down time isn't that long, and the Lifetaps. Let's try to get improvement on what we need instead of trying to get something that we know were not going to get.<P>34 Wiz<BR>24 Necro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The average price of EE's is 1k.  I can get a Cleric to res me for 200pp on a bad day... Now I will not deny that Convergence is not a handy spell but lets not make it sound like something I just run around and cast on n00b's that die...<P>"they get pets that are as strong as mages"<P>Sorry but the Mages pet is hands down more powerful.

So unless I am slumming if I try to restore my HPs I will have to fight.  Sure Lich is nice [even if it is nerfed] but when you consider I have to spend mana to regain lost HPs it balances out.<P>"Like wizards were not already sharing most of what they have with rest of the classes"<P>Umm...
