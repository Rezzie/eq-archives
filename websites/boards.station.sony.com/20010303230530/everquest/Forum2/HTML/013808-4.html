</FONT><HR>Abashi I agree with your post generally; however, there's one piece of rhetoric you use all too often I'd like to point out.<P>When someone makes a valid negative comment, you can dilute it to the point that it's meaningless, and therefore prevent the comment frmo doing any good, by saying "yes, there is room for improvement like there is in everything." This puts all suggestions about all topics into one general statement and makes them meaningless.<P>Much more meaningful is to address the SPECIFIC issue raised. Don't say EQ could be improved like all games could - say yes, the trade skills could be better if other attributes like dexterity were included.<P>Instead of saying the message board could be better like all message boards could be, say yes, allowing only people with accounts to post will improve the boards.<P>So, rather than have you respond the lum the mad articls - which I have not read - by saying EQ could be better like all games, a comment which says nothing (it agrees with some criticism too vague to help at all), say something specific.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I hate to say this, but my interpreation of Lum the mad is that this is a power play by him. He runs the danger of being irrelevant, as a constant critic. He can get a feeling of being important if he causes a big change.<P>I watched an earlier incident where he went after GM's. The way he told the story, it wasn't the way someone tells the story without an agenda - it went out of its way to say the GM had broken rules in a way that would get him in trouble. And it seemed to have worked.<P>Now I'd guess Lum is taking on Abashi for his own agenda. I'm much more protective of Abashi who I have seen do a lot of good than some loudmouth who ocassionally does some good among his ranting when it suits his needs. Lum would be the notorious person who brought down Abashi, increasing his power, striking fear into the next spokesperson who had BETTER listen to Lum and do what he wants.<P>I would ignore Lum here as a loudmouth.<P>BTW Lum clearly knows how to treat web readers nicely, where his feedback says you almost certainly will not get any response from him.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>&lt;sigh&gt;<BR>I think it's important to note that Lum's articles are *not* particularly well supported or argued.  From an English writing perspective (*ahem* hard-fought degree at work here..), his thoughts are based on misquotations bordering on plagiarism, or are unsupported at all.  Using semi-clever language to string endlessly nonreferenced "quotes" by Gordon together, he is able to "argue" his way through anything.  Here's an example below:<P>"...my job here is to know everything there is to know about EverQuest, represent the player-base in our meetings, and keep in touch with the public..." (" Lum," http://www.lumthemad.net/news/968886895,29409,.shtml)<P>By paraphrasing in this manner (excessively chopping this sentence at the front and back), he may have taken it completely out of context, and rendered it meaningless when compared to the original.  The original quote might even appear something like this and have a whole new flavor:<P>"According to Lum's mom, my job here is to know everything there is to know about EverQuest, represent the player-base in our meetings, and keep in touch with the public although really I'm a hopscotch super-genius, and I play a bard who can twine 5 different song elements while jumping from square to square."<P>See how this works?  By the same token, we could play with Lum in the same manner:<P>"Gordon 'Abashi' Wrinn personifies..<BR>..the quality and quantity of information passing between Verant Interactive, Inc. and the player-base of Everquest as a whole.<BR>I've..<BR>..set his company's tone as adversarial to their playerbase."<P>And so on.  Another trick of his is to make wild leaps of thought with NO factual support at all.  See below:<P>"Abashi has made a career out of pissing people off. People actually warn people away from Everquest in game stores because "the company hates their players". I've seen it happen (and no, I was not the person doing the warning). Abashi has set his company's tone as adversarial to their playerbase. This isn't wild ranting opinion, it's a simple statement of fact.<BR>("Lum," http://www.lumthemad.net/news/968886895,29409,.shtml)"<P>Ah..  ok.  First of all, who are "these people," WHERE exactly did he "see it happen," and how does any of that apply in any measure to Abashi's presumed career of pissing people off where he set the adversarial tone of the playerbase??  He's establishing authority where none exists, to prove a different point completely unrelated to the subject of his thought.  How did these imaginary people in Lum's head that warn people away from EQ relate to Gordon's career of pissing people off, or his "adversarial tone (Which I'd like to see him define, as it distinctly resembles a mood rather than literal tone.  Good try though, you get a yellow star!)?"  In short, supporting nonsense ideas with what you may have heard from imaginary friends or your mother doesn't quite prove anything as "a simple statement of fact."<P>This is just the first half-page, folks.  You could go on and on, but frankly, at this point it ceases to be amusing.  Short of randomly 'quoting' the bible, Lum is reverting to the same embarrassing methods that any Dr. Laura-class hack with a junior-high grade education can display.  Don't let it dupe you, you're all smarter than that.  Furthermore, what Lum is doing is actually illegal.  Misquotation to that degree does in fact smack of plagiarism and defamation of character.  Verant could very easily shut it down overnight and take Lum's keyboard away.  But they haven't.  Why?  Because they think that anyone with an attention span longer than 30 seconds can think hard and long enough to figure him out.<P>Don't get me wrong, I don't necessarily agree with Abashi or Verant about any/all of their decisions, but we can argue them with better than the "MY DAD CAN BEAT UP YOUR DAD!!" approach that articles like this are proposing.<P>And for those of you that didn't get any of this, I'll revise to the above technique of writing:<P>"Uh..  I slept with Lum's mom."<P>"And it really wasn't any g00D!"<P><BR>Sorry.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hrmm. This will probably get my account banned, but I'll have to say I agree completely with Lum. Sorry, Abashi, you may be a perfectly good person, but the attitude that comes from your posts is just downright awful. The communication before Abashi got here was not as often, true, but we were at least told mostly the truth. It's nice to have someone in PR who can get changes done (and doesn't THREATEN the playerbase), like when Aradune and other developers were the only ones posting here.<P>And as to this being a "power play" by Lum? Yeah, right. He's a ranter (notice the site title) and all he did this for was to say that, in his opinion, it is time for Abashi to go. And many, many people agree with him. If Abashi gets fired, it will be because people, whether or not they've read this rant, decide that it really WAS better before he arrived. And if you read the second part of his article, he mentions something: People really DO believe they can get banned for merely expressing an opposing opinion. Lum's board slogan is "Moderated by Stalinists For the Children" but it's nowhere NEAR as harshly censored as Whineplay is. If I actually had a decent character, I probably wouldn't post this, because who knows when next they decide to ban random people for "breaking the Rules of Conduct" or whatever their excuse may be.<P>Also, I know that it's probably a horrible job to have to deal with SOME of the posters on this board, but it's affecting the responses to reasonable suggestions/discussions as well. For what I wish I'd see more of, see the tradeskills board, Rowyl's posts, and old Aradune posts. People who can say Yes or No, and actually have the power to get things changed, and apparently actually pay attention, even to things that have been discussed before, and are willing to listen to any argument on the very slim off chance it might help them change their mind. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Very interesting thread.<P>I've debated myself for some time as to what good these boards do...  Changing the boards to active accounts only with poster accountability was and is an attempt to make them constructive and both a benefit to Verant and our customers.<P>So many positive game changes have occurred because of these boards.  Also, because of the official posts here appearing on boards everywhere, I really think it's a fairly efficient way to get the word out on issues.<P>But, then, there's the negativity.  The posts that we should replace people, or that we never listen, or that our PR and CS is horrible, all on a board that we've put up and maintain.  The generalizations are ludicrous (were it all true, of course, then there wouldn't be a board, nor an internet relations manager, and you wouldn't see many, many changes that originated from our customers implemented), but it's there.  Does it hurt the game?  Does it hurt Verant?<P>I don't know.  It's hard to measure.<P>We do know that the vast majority of players don't read the boards themselves.  Significantly more read the headlines summarized elsewhere, but even all the people who read all the fan sites related to EQ don't total to that many relative to our subscription base.  But then, most of the people who do post play the game a LOT, know it very well, and have excellent insight.<P>We also know that the game continues to sell extremely well, that relatively VERY few people are leaving.  The interactions with people in game, the emails and other feedback we get, is generally very positive.<P>So, I don't know.  I do know that if I felt they were doing more harm then good, I'd shut them down.  But it's pretty hard to do an empirical analysis given how many variables are involved as well as many subjective aspects.<P>In my opinion, overall, Abashi does a good job.  Sometimes he doesn't handle a situation optimally, and well, neither do I.  We're human, after all.  But his general policy has been to be blunt and to the point and to try NOT to spin things.  It's confusing sometimes, reading the criticisms, because I see people claiming he's spinning issues, but then I see other complaints that he's not taking the side of the player and being 'positive'.<P>Which is best?  Blunt, no B.S., tell it like it is, objective posting?  Or I'm your friend, I'll represent your side to those developer guys and seem all disappointed if they don't agree with you?<P>If you prefer the latter, then your dissatisfaction is probably my fault, because I prefer the former and I'm the guy who worked with Abashi in terms of how and what we wanted posted early on.  I don't care for politicians, and people who pretend, and people who spin things because I guess I generally see through it.  <P>Anyway, we'll continue to listen.  We'll continue to post and to communicate.  We'll continue to take good ideas and implement them if possible.  And we'll continue to do our best to correct aspects of the game that could be improved.<P>I think, overall, that the game is better because of the boards despite the negativity and unrealistic expectations that continue to appear.  The genre is relatively new, as are forums where developers are so accessible.  And, as I've posted before, there aren't many MMORPGs so there's less choice.  While I disagree with the assertions that we have a monopoly, I do think that there will be less complaining in the future due to more choice as well as the fact that the player base as a whole will mature in the sense that they'll understand more what is doable and what makes a great game.  <P>Until then, though, we have the responsibility to improve EQ while simultaneously keeping it true to what it is at its core.  And we'll also keep the boards up and keep listening.  But we WILL control the signal to noise ratio.  If anything, we'll become more strict.  Negative, pointless, flaming drives away players with constructive criticism (negative and positive) - of that I am certain.  And yeah, it also makes the game and the game's community look bad.<P>So, in closing, I'd really recommend that those of you who are upset with aspects of the game and would like to see change to keep things constructive.  If you don't, honestly, you become self-defeating, because were the board to degenerate into purely flames and insults we'd shut it down, eliminating a fantastic avenue for you to affect the very change you want.   Really, you risk losing your account AND losing these forums, and, knowing that you're all paying customers who care deeply about the game, I really don't think you want either.  <P>-Brad<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Petoffen,<P>That was Lum's wife that wrote the posts regarding the GM if I recall correctly. She was the one who got screwed around by him. And quite frankly I agree with her 100%, she had some very valid points there. The end result was NOT the fault of a power-mad rant site, it WAS the fault of a power-mad GM! The site was simply an avenue through which the true story could be provided.<P>And that latter point is an important one. The thought police are running rampant here; banning, warning, suspending if folks waver from what is seen as acceptible. The problem is no one really knows what is acceptible. Sure, we're aware of the extremes but there's a pretty big grey area here that, if you venture into it, can get you hammered in a hurry.<P>The quick answer to that is just have everyone shutup, talk nice, and bite their tongues. That's certainly the safe route. I don't know about you but that sort of thing scares the begeezus outta me. <P>Rant sites like Lum's play a VERY important role in getting information to the player base. Yes, you are reading opinions, and there's reminders of that splattered all over the website (the reference you made to the email is a good example of this, and also quite humorous I find...as it was intended). Some of this info is just fun, reactionary rants, just as advertised. But every now and then some very important issues come down the pipe and sites like Lum's have been at the forefront of getting the story out. <P>A good example of this IS GM Hokaku &lt;sp?&gt; to which you referred. This WAS a case of GM abuse and it needed to be dealt with. The degree of punishment he received has nothing to do with Lum, but rather Verant....cause, well, Hokaku was in their world then. An even better example of the role rant sites play in keeping people informed was very evident with the entire fiasco surrounding GM Darwin in UO. If you're not famailiar with this check out Lums, there's some great archived info there on it. In short though he and Dr. Twister played a leading role in getting this guy nailed. Bravo!<P>You don't have to agree with him and you certainly don't have to like him. But when gaming companies start threatening customers with their Fortified Double Axes of Bannishment simply for stating an opinion, then yeah, something is terribly wrong. And it's the Lum's of the world that are gonna pitch that story. One can agree or not with the conclusions drawn, that's not the issue. The fact that these stories are told at all is. <P>Sophist</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Brad, when you say that "relatively VERY few people are leaving", I hope you consider that eBay sales/direct transfers of accounts are quite common, especially among higher level characters (whose characters hold greater value and whose players are also more prone to burnout).  I know people with 2 and 3 accounts, and I feel it's safe to assume that there are players with even more.<P>Does the 70% retention rate Abashi quotes, and which you allude to, reflect that?  <P>As far as the board is concerned; a second crackdown on flames is more than welcome.

</FONT><HR>I kind of realize that, though my point was (and I apologize for not coming right out and saying it), we'd definitely like more of this.<P>Yes, Abashi is just one person, acknowledged, however, as mentioned in another thread, it's the "apparent" post and forget process that has seemed to brought about the very common practice of 'self-bumping' threads, and multiple threads on single topics.<P>I guess it happens in the hopes that the thread will be noticed again (or in the case of a new thread, noticed at a first time), and the new points will be discussed.<P>Several seemingly good counter points, arguments, and example scenarios are 'apparently' ignored when posted beyond a certain point in a thread life cycle.  That's rather frustrating to the poster and those that are interested in the subject, regardless of whether they agree with the poster or not.<P>Some of the best threads contain multiple replies from yourself, Abashi and other Verant reps...  Even sometimes apparently resulting in a consensous between the customers and Verant on that particular subject thread.<P>It's nice, and it's cool, and it's really fun when it works that way.<P>Anyway, again, I'd just like to see more of that kind of dialog...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Brad:<P>What initiated all of this was Abashi placing a warning on a player's account for posting something that virtually no one thought warranted a warning. To his credit, he retracted the warning but I can only help but wonder if this was an aberration or is part of a pattern of behavior.  Warning and banning players for obvious things like making physical threats, racist remarks, or using repeated obscenities is one thing...warning and banning them based on the flimsiest of excuses (because "others" had insinuated that he sometimes played in God mode) or because Abashi is having a bad day is quite another.<P>There is a difference between flaming and criticism; between personal attacks and heated discussion.  Right now I'm not at all confident that Abashi understands the distinction between legitimate criticism and destructive flaming.

</FONT><HR>This is hilarious.  Lum, I love you man, but you are off your rocker. =)  haha, oh well, anything for Page Hits I guess, eh? *poke*<P>As for Abashi?  Sheesh, people. Lighten up.  You act like everything he posts here is from HIS mouth.  He is our link of communication.  He is the messenger most of the time.  Fire him?  Sure, then someone will fill the position. What is he supposed to do? "I'm really really really sorry to say this, my friends, but, my boss said that Rangers are okay. They are still testing them, and I agree with you guys, but, doesn't look like anything I can do"<P>If you knew ANYTHING about corporate structure, it is that ALL aspects of the company must APPEAR to agree, even if they dont.  Abashi was hired because he understand, very well, what the developers wanted to accomplish with EQ, and the "vision".<P>The problem is that, as Brad stated, there aren't a bunch of choices. So, if you want to play a game of this nature, EQ is as good as it gets. Is it perfect? No.  Does it do what the developers intended? Yes, and for a large majority of the players, this is the same thing they want; a PvE game, long term challenge, and a social aspect.  If this isn't what you want, then NOTHING speaks louder than cancelling your account.<P>Countless times, whenever someone says, "EQ is fading, people dont like it any more, etc etc etc", Verant laughs all the way to the bank.  Why?  Well, because despite your "brilliant observation", the numbers say differently.  This is where people go to *****. Period.  Of course it is going to be negative.  Ever go to McDonalds and see that sign that says, "Tell us how we're doing. Dial 1 800 6 TELL US".  Haha, how many people use that to go, "Yeah, just wanted to say the person who helped me was awesome.  BTW, your cheeseburgers were the best today!"  *rolls his eyes*<P>EQ is a fantastic game. It accomplished much more than it was ever intended to do.  It is the first step in many for a great game development company.  ID didn't make Quake3 as their first game, either.<P>As for the UO complaint ratio, etc?  Haha, UO has reached its peak.  The only people playing UO are the people who ENJOY it.  You wont see many people posting about how much UO sucks any more on any UO boards.  And, once Verant FINALLY puts a "class balance lock" on EQ, you probably wont see it much here any more, either.<P>EQ is the most successful game of its kind..ever.  It is one of the most successful PC games ever.... period.  The task of "cummunicating" with the players is a daunting one.  And, when players threaten, flame, accuse, be rude, etc, and repost the same old same old every day, it becomes even more difficult.<P>I wish they would get more strict.  These boards have gone to crap, and it isn't the game's fault, Abashi's fault.... it is Verant's fault for allowing "whiners" to post crap here.  It has gotten better, but I still think they need to put the smack down more. =)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Brad, thank you very much for the reply.  I understand that your account numbers are unaffected by an eBay sale, but I think the playerbase has shrunk by more than 30%.  This is due to players owning multiple accounts, and I'll bet the level 40+ players on eBay are not being sold to complete newcomers to EQ.   <P>On the other hand, I fully appreciate that it'd be difficult to track changes in account information (credit card billing) if no automated report is already in place.  Ah well--if such a report were available, I suppose a crackdown on eBay sales would have already occured. :-)  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I called for Gordon's firing. Ouch.

Yet if one were to judge strictly by quantity, I'd say most of Abashi's posts on here are simply "Issue X is not going to change, X is balanced and that's the way it is" without even saying WHY issue X is balanced... so the readers see this as a blunt dismissal of their claims.<P>To use an example of a regular post on here, I think a lot of wizard complaints would go away if he simply said why their "rain" spells work the way they do, and how it is balanced, instead of stonewalling.<P>I for one do appreciate you guys posting here though. <P>Zzyx<BR>E-Marr mage</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I submit that he has crossed the line and has moved from being blunt to being condescending and from being forthright to being smarmy.  And he shows no sign of controlling himself in the future, nor any remorse for his recent over-the-top actions.<P>Abashi IS harming the player community as it extends to the people who frequent this and other EQ-Based websites.

But people from the industry post there / grant interviews (including Brad) / join round-table discussions.

</FONT><HR>Well I feel that I have to carefully word my postings nowadays for fear that I might offend whatever sensitivities are in force at the present moment. <P>Okay, I think a lot of Abashi's problem is in relation of his producers letter way back in 1999 that he posted that he would "represent player issues" to the live tuning team. Unfortunately (my perception) that the player issues are filtered through VI employee sensibilities that may or may not be in tune with player sentiments. Thus in the instances that you list:<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>Which is best? Blunt, no B.S., tell it like it is, objective posting? Or I'm your friend, I'll represent your side to those developer guys and seem all disappointed if they don't agree with you?<BR>&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>For him to choose the former as his persona on-line, he is (disclaimer IMHO) in effect betraying his own mission statement that he laid out in his producer's letter. Hence the flames, slams and whatnots he receives. <P>Yes, Brad. Shocking as it may appear to you, a lot of people dislike ad resent "blunt" and straightforward people characterizing them as insensitive, rude boors. IMHO (again), this is the persona Abashi is projecting now to me. Diplomacy is one of the hardest proffesions in the world to do well. Abashi is proving that again and again. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Aradune,<P>Perception is Reality.<P>If people think there's a problem with the way Internet CS is being handled, then there is.  Your job, (Verant's job), is to fix it, not deny the problem exists.  My personal complaints:<P>1.  Well-thought post to which Abashi responds only to a portion of the post, and not the "big picture" of it.  i.e. answering the easy question, ignoring the hard ones.<P>2.  Abashi posting a response explaining Verant's position on a specific issue and then after the player's rebute that stance, refuses to follow-up anymore.<P>3.  The fact that everyone agrees Abashi is simply a mouthpiece with slightly more power and a LOT more pull in the arena, yet "Corporate" continues to let issue 1 and 2 slide with the excuse that "Abashi is only one person."<P>Hire another person!  If issue 1 and 2 still can not be met, then hire yet another person.  Continue this trend until issues 1 and 2 can be resolved 95% of the time of more.<P>As your favorite creative-writer would say... hiring internet CS representatives is HARD!<P>Meorah Chophen<BR>51 Monk, Tribunal<P>P.S.  That 3rd issue is the worst.  It hurts me to think that you guys believe that another $40k per year (2 additional full-time Abashis) to give the customers an area for gameplay debate would burn a hole too deep in your pocket.  Its worth so much more than that in future-proofing the name-recognition of Verant.  I firmly believe that this game has raised the stakes of the gaming market to the point where consumers will no longer judge new products on the sole basis of the gameplay.  They will continue to check up and see how the CS for the company is currently being handled.  The only reason this can come to pass is because they feel betrayed by the game design... ONLY after they have poured hour after hour of THEIR time into building a character, leveling that character up, practicing skills, meeting people.  Most newbies want to kill a dragon as an excuse to throw a huge celebration and be heralded as heros to the entire realm.  By the time they reach the point that they can kill a dragon, they've become jaded and are only interested in "ph4t L3wtz".  Roleplaying at 50+ happens if you decide to pretend you're Batman, or Def Leppard, or Bruce Lee.  There is absolutely ZERO roleplaying at 50+, because everybody has already divulged who they are.  Quite simply, when worrying about "keeping the mystery intact", you should have been concentrating on the mystery of the characters, not the mystery of who gains experience faster, or how powerful a monk's fists are at level 47.  I could go on forever (probably twice as long), but I just realized this is probably 1/4 page P.S., so I'll just stop.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

It's the posters who are testing the limits, seeing how hard they can push us, who need to be worried. "<P>I'm not so sure your staff recognizes the difference between civil and antagonistic.<P>As the probably too often used example of the warning of a player for expressing his thought that Verant employees play EQ in god mode (even though he never meant to or actually said that), IS NOT antagonistic and that view was actually presented civilly.<P>My point is that you folks have lately been entering discourse with your player base with an us vs them attitude and have been filtering our feedback through that attitude.<P>IF the above post was NOT filtered through that attitude, it's real intent would have been easily discernable (not that the warning in question on it's percieved intent was right in any sense).<P>It's real Brad... and it's evident by the prevalent view points expressed.<P>Just for fun though, I'm the head of a software development product/service, so what I'm going to do is tell the next client who says something like, "you use this thing with intimate knowledge and you have no clue what we have to go through" that I'm going to begin the steps to stop them from paying me for the use of my product/service anymore.<P>Sounds pretty damn scary doesn't it?<P>Having said that, I realized I don't have those kind of concerns because I admit with humility as nifty as a developer I might be, they are the users and my clients and if I'm not making them walk away with a smile then I'm not doing my job.<P>And for that matter.<P>You limited your choices in public relations to a rather small subset of the possiblities.<P>Why can't Abashi simply present the facts, but do it in a customer friendly manner?<P>For example, the guild deletion controversy...<P>NUMEROUS threads have been begun and ignored on this very sensitive subject, yet no replies.<P>The patch message gave no reasoning why.<P>What we had left was a general fear that our guilds would be deleted withour recourse or concern because we didn't meet a magic number at a certain date.<P>Just think about that and I'm sure as a compassionate and intelligent person you'll understand the point.<P>Why the heck couldn't that have been written much more considerately.<P>You want people to trash their treasured guilds?

</FONT><HR>Yes, but don't forget, the folks who post on these boards represents a very small percentage of the game community.  Asking Verant to keep hiring until everyone on these boards is happy doesn't make sense.  They will need a REAL wake up call to make drastic changes.  Loss of accounts and profitablity, etc.  However, everything points to Verant increasing profit and accounts.

</FONT><HR>Just to be brief, but yes, most players DO think the game has gone downhill since Gordon has appeared on the boards. Initially he was a very nice person and got a TON of cool stuff addressed, much like the awesome UI guy who has been posting lately. But as the article explains, and all the other boards (like FoH's homepage) expand on Lums views, and yes - Gordon has done nothing but put us all down and basically is the only drawback to playing the game now. We can't even post anymore without losing our accounts for the most part (heck, im nervous as I type this.). It took 9 *months* to finally address the Ranger issue. It should have taken a week at most. Priorities should be on the game at hand, NOT future expansions. Those should be put on halt when 1/13th of your entire game has a major issue. You should have moved about 20 programmers to figure out why taunt isnt working, why rangers are getting pummeled, and basiaclly why stats are doing absolutrely near to nothing. I could go on, but everything people have been bringing up gets a negative answer .. You NEVER tell a customer no, you tell them you'll find out a way if its possible, and if not, make a compromise. You dig in deep and say no to virtually anything anyone brings up, probably actually consulting the hardcore programmers before doing it.. Ive seen responses to posts about why something can't be added, and you respond to the message within a few MINUTES that it just inst possible to program. Why not go talk to the programmer for a few hours and figure out exactly why not. Most programmers can figure things out. Hire a few more if it makes improvements. I could go on.. Basically, the customers are hearing about all these new programmers, and 'resources' Verant has at their fingertips from Brad now, but we still get a firm NO ISNT POSSIBLE from Gordon. What the heck? If you got a new team of 20 programmers at your service, what are they doing? .. From our perspective: Not a whole lot. Sorry, this turned into a rant, but basiaclly, everyone agree's with Lum and the FoH site.. All the boards I browse all agree the the same thing.. Some a far worse than others. But the banning people and deciding not to respond to posts because someone is upset and loses his cool is just silly. Since when do companies get egos so big that they can just deathtouch their own playerbase?! It's pretty bad! Try looking at it from our angle! It's horrible sometimes!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Brad<P>When I say that I feel Abashi puts a spin on everything I am referring to the manner in which he addresses issues.<P>You may not agree with me on this but picking your fights IS spin doctoring,arguing semantics and not the spirit of a complaint IS spin doctoring,picking out a single tiny issue in a post or thread with a massive amount of information because he feels he has a valid argument while ignoring all the other points which are the real thrust of the post or thread IS spin doctoring.<P>You talk about Abashi being blunt or playing the friend like its a choice and different people want different things is valid but once again not the point.I personally not care less how he approaches the issue as long as in the end I get the information I want.An off the cuff answer with no follow up to an issue that a portion of the player base considers important is not acceptable.Its been stated before in this thread answers to a massive thread in the vein of "because we want it that way" or "it works as intended" with no elaboration whatsoever is not acceptable.<P>Answers like that only serve to incite the people who care about the subject.Some insight into the reasoning behind it would do much to pacify people who the issue is important to.It may not satisfy them and they may disagree but at least we will have some clue into what in the world you were thinking.When we get the because we say so answer the first instict is to think that you can't be bothered to follow up and check on it expecially when down the road investigation is done and you ARE wrong.<P>Off the cuff answers with no follow up are simply one way communication which may be fine for preschoolers but when you are dealing with a customer you have to go farther.If the issue is as you said there is only one Abashi then perhaps you need to consider expanding your internet relations staff so as they may better serve the player base.The fact is Abashi can't have all the information to converse on an equal level with players of classes he has no grasp of and a 5 minute consult with the one member of your staff who does is quite simply not enough.<P>You wonder why players are feeling disenfranchised right now well perhaps it may well have to do with the fact that since Abashi has come on board as internet relations manager the player base in my estimation anyway has likely roughly doubled so it would only make sense that he needs help.He is constantly on the front lines and taking the brunt of the criticism for many things beyond his control so that naturally leads to the bunker mentality that many of us are seeing in his relations with the customers.You may not see it as such but unfortunately we as customers do and aren't we the ones he is here to serve?<P>Tsorath Ravenspirit<BR>54 shaman<BR>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I would think that those accounts over a year old would be somewhat valued to you.  As would be my opinion to other players. <P>This is not the first time I have been insulted.  Check your archived messageboard you will find that it was my account that posted the thread on mage pets being unable to duel wield that eventually brought about the change.  You should also note before Abashi admitted that they dont dual wield he claimed that it was thoroughly tested and not up for debate reguardless of parsing.  He went on to say that perhaps he should hold a pet clinic on Test so we would shut up on the matter.  Two parsed logs later he admitted it needed to be re-evaluated.  Abashi is not above "pushing the limits", even today he complimented someone for flaming a thread<P>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/012715.html<P>You know personally I have nothing against you people at Verant.  I could truly care less about who you are or how you live your lives. When you understand that 99% of the playerbase feels this way also you might not get so offended over innocent remarks. What I do care about is Everquest, so please in all my posts in the future take into account I wont be insulting any of you directly because I dont care about you, I dont have the time to waste thinking up something clever to say and then snicker behind 8 pounds of plastic and glass.
