</FONT><HR>Recently I was in Greater Faydark with a lower level friend, Mystnight, that I was helping. Since she was near level four, I suggested that we go to Freeport for better experience at that level. I then began auctioning for a teleport to West Commons. <P>Eventually, a halfling druid by the name of Sippwini replied saying that she could take me. My friend and I met her outside the Kelethin bank along with another halfling by the name of Volfey who she agreed to teleport. She told me that it would cost 15p so I paid her, then apparently I misunderstood and it was 15p each, 30p for my friend and I. After spending much of my money on jewel crafting (all you fellow enchanters can understand that) I decided that it was not worth it and we could just take the boat there. I asked for my money back but instead she disbanded my friend and began teleporting Volfey and I (at this point it would not allow me to disband). We were taken to Butcherblock rather than West Commons, and she had made me leave Mystnight behind at the bank. When we all zoned I asked why she did that but she had disconnected herself. Volfey and I were both enraged that she had stolen our money and I petitioned shortly afterward. <P>When a GM by the name of Kolirt finally replied I told him the story and he said that there was nothing he could do since Sippwini was no longer online. I thought to myself fine, I'll wait until she is back online and petition again. I had put her on my friends list to know when she'd be back and sure enough a few hours later she was there. I petitioned once again and the same GM replied and told me that he would tell the senior GM to talk with Sippwini. After receiving no reply for a while I sent a tell to Kolirt to ask what happened and he said that there was nothing he could do, "it's a buyer beware issue, never time beware". <P>Justice had not been served. It wasn't about the money, of course I could get more by doing the Stein of Moggok quest a few times. It was the principle, someone had stolen from me and had gotten away with it. I then sent a tell directly to Sippwini telling her that I hope she was proud of herself. At this point I wasn't sure if it was really a misunderstand or not until she replied by mocking me. I had had enough. I've come to these message boards not to warn about GM incompetence (we all know about that) but to warn everyone out there that giving the benefit of the doubt isn't always the best way...and to make it known that Sippwini of the Prexus server is an immature thief, beware of her.<P>Atren of Norraths Army<BR>Level 29 High Elf Enchanter<BR>Prexus Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You have every right to be angry at one who gives us druids a bad name.  The less scrupulous would use their powers to ks/train such and individual.  I certainly wouldn't recommend such bad behavior.  However, spamming the name of this person in every zone you go to is most appropriate.  If you have a guild, encourage them to do the same until this soul finds herself unable to offer transport for anyone again.<P>Rianne Shadygrove<BR>Druid of 41 seasons<P>The GM can't help you in this case.  But they won't help Sipwini either when you drag her name through the dirt.

</FONT><HR>Well why I think that what this druid did to you is wrong, I don't think you'll find to many druids willing to port you without payment first. People have a bad habit of taking off after being ported and not settling up on their bill. Simple fact of the matter is more druids get ripped off this way than people get ported or not ported to the correct locale. <P>Druid person lvl 39. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok having a RL friend that plays a dr00d, and playing that dr00d myself, i can these things.<P>1) You can disband at anytime, w/ the exception of when you yourself are casting. (Not meant as a flame just pointing it out)<P>2) That's lame of the person, however, following the person in different zones is even more so, and can lead to you getting warn/banned for harasement(sp?), something that GM's/Guide's do enforce quite strongly.<P>3) I don't normally pay for ports and don't see why I should. I know someone will flame me for this however, I don't mind going to rez someone if they die (as long as i'm not busy) and therefore expect the same from support classes (like wiz/dru).  I will offer donations, if the person has gone out of his way to help me.  But at the end of the day, it's not very often that i ask someone out of the blue for ports, because that's what friends and guild members are for.  Just like Clerics are there to rez.<P>4) Payment would normally work in service rendered.  Which means you port first then get paid.  It's not very often that someone cannot afford 10-15pp and would destroy a reputation over something so lame.<P>  Vlaen <BR>~Templar~<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think she was wrong to do that. However, 15p is cheap money to find a bad seed. Also, was this just a misunderstanding? You will feel a fool if you spam bad stuff about her then later have to apologize. Also, how long did you keep her waiting? Did you ask for a port, then tell her you needed to go to bank and waste 10 minutes of her day?<BR>I am a porting druid, and I am sick of all the crap people pull. They beg and beg for a port, make me go out of my way to get them the port, then don't pay. Some say, " oh I just need to go to the bank, wait here". Don't waste my damned time. I feel like I go way out of my way for people, yet they think my time is cheaper than there's. If you want a port, offer 20 to 30 plat unless the druid is advertising ports, then pay 10. 10plat for me leaving my hunting ground at level 40 is a complete insult. I usually don't take the 10 plat, and explain to them it wasn't worth my time. I think 30 to 50 plat is reasonable compensation for a 40 druid, if you are sending the tell to him.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hail thier, <P> I am a Cleric who, is only able to Gate to where he is Bound. When I need a GG to someplace I will look and see who is high enough lvl to do it. Than I will PM them and I will ask. If they are not currently busy and if they have a moment, could they GG me to whereever I will offer a payment up front. I have been told no I am busy try me back later or sure no sweat. I understand that only a few can GG to all places and I think they do hard work. So I say lets give a Hand to those Hard working Druids and Wizards out thier. And this Gnome who backstabbed you did hurt her class. It makes ya not want to trust anyone. So if I where you becarful about it but yes warn others that she is not to be trusted.

It's rare, though it angers me when it happens slightly, when I teleport first and the person disbands before offering donation. <P>Besides, my teleports aren't on a fixed-price basis.

Expirienced that myself too often.<P>However, for me, the 10pp are not the big deal that I need it. So I always port for free, with the restriction that I only port, if I have time to.

</FONT><HR>Last weekend I ported people over 100 trips. Of that 75 trips I was either paid in advance (Clarity, buffs or Donation) of the 25 who said they would pay when we got to the destination 15 did and the other 15 just took off. Most of these were my own fault as they said they needed invis because they were KOS at the druid rings.  I normally /ooc if I am porting and will take buffs and donations but not charge but will charge a minimum of 10pp for a port if I am soloing as I can make more pp than that in the 10 minuts it takes me to port and med up and then run to my hunting spot. Will I make everyone pay in advance no. Will I continue to get burned sure.  But the people who want a port from me better not be on my no help list.  I have gone so far as to tell a group that I would be happy to port all of them except for the one person who ripped me off.  Druid aren't the only ones who can be jerks but know that people remember who you are and your turn will come and a lot of people keep a list of friends and jerks.  Luckily the list of people I owe favours to is longer that the list of jerks. Please don't let one jerk make you hate all druids and remember treat others how you would like to be treated.

</FONT><HR>About ports I as a Shaman would like to say. You can get a port anytime by any of the porters and belive me the good ones will not ask for money, they will just do it for free if they have the time. However it is always nice to give a donataion of what you see fit. If a druid or Wizzy ports you at least give him some money not just say thank you and disban and leave, I usualy give between 10-20pp and say thanks and walaaa.<P>ok some druids do give bad rep to others but dont mind them just go your way and leave em alone.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would like to point out a fact that seems basic, but has many implications. You can not ever change your first name (unless forced to). This is done because Verant realizes that too many people like to hide under the cover of anonimity, and rip people off. They then wrongly think that you are harrassing them if you tell other people. Being a druid, and leader of Stormryders, I have had people rip off myself and guildmembers. While I would hesitate to use the word spamming,I have found that if you announce their evil deeds to entire zones in a roleplaying context, the GM's are quite ameneable to it. Harrasment would only come in if you were accually spamming this guy, noone can tell a GM to make you shut up for talking to everyone else in the zone.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I give ports and don't ask for money ahead of time but most just pay me in advance. Some pay me after. It don't matter to me. I've had some say they'll pay me and take off without paying...it happens, oh well, I don't make a big deal about it. I'm rich as it is. The only thing that scares me is right after being paid in advance, lag about disconnects me and it would take me 5-10 min to get back on.

</FONT><HR>Hyrule,<BR> You are lvl 29 and Paid for a Port?<BR>Hello, most druids are glad for a clarity buff in trade for a port. And as you get higher in lvl you can offer more ( insight, Gift of Magic ).<BR>This may sound vain, but I am lvl 40 ENC and never pay for a port. I trade my buffs which causes them to regain mana faster so they can port more times. If they dont wish to trade buffs and insist on cash I just wait till another druid comes by who is more reasonable. To those druids who find that idea offensive perhaps I should start chargeing for a clarity?  I mean you could all ways just sit and med back up (time). Just like I could walk (time).<P>A side note, as a ENC, I all ways buff a cleric when ever I see them. You never know when you may need thier services.
