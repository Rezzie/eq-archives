</FONT><HR>Biggest thing I can say is make Taunt more effective.  The warrior Epic deals with this issue nicely however for those of us that don't yet wield the blades (like myself since maestro is being Stingy) making taunt more effective would be a godsend.<P>The worst thing to hear in a group is "Laodorf Taunt dangit!" when in fact I am mashing my taunt key like there is no tomorrow and yet the beasty continues to ignore me and my two 19dly weapons and continues to beat on the palidin wielding some slow as snot two-hander.<P>Only other comment is this: (and it actually touches on several other epic quests)<P>Why in the world was an item for our epic quest placed on a relatively low level MoB, in a plane that I have no buisness hogging, as a rare drop?  Most of the items required to find/aquire are perfectly reasonable in my view of an "epic" quest...  Killing dragons, killing super beastys in the Plane of Air, kiling the leader of the dark minions of a dark fortress....  yet here I am after all that. . . camping the Plane of Hate (which my guild had outgrown months and months ago) thereby making it impossible for appropriate leveled guilds to experience the plane as they should, while I wait for a MoB that only spawns every 24 hours to drop an item that is rare.<P>Every other spawn that you must hunt down in this quest seems reasonable,  most were somewhat challenging and a few were even "epic",  and yet I am stuck farming a plane to complete my blades...  this seems somwhat out of whack.<P>aside from that I am pleased with the current state of warriors...  I liked the idea of enchanters having a "complete mana replinish" sort of spell for clerics to keep me going =)<P>-Laodorf almost 60 warrior<BR>&lt;Storm's Fury&gt;<BR>Erollisi Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Having scanned the various replies to this message I am seeing a LOT of requests to prevent the SK and Paladins from becoming more and more like warriors.  <P>At the same time I am seeing LOTS of requests for increases or improvements to the Bind Wounds skill.  <P>If a warrior is able to heal himself and possibly others with his bind wounds skill, hasn't he become a "healing tank" at that point?  Doesn't such a situation bite into the paladin's realm?  Do warriors really wish to hold such a double standard?<P>Being dependent on others for healing IS frightening, but so is being dependent on others for taking damage and taunting off mobs.<P>Face it, Mr. Tank, the blade does cut both ways.<P>Lanceor d'Avignon<BR>Acceptor of 34 truths of Mithanial Marr<BR>Xegony<P>Perception is reality, but truth is virtuous.<BR>-Mithian Proverb</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Above and beyond what others have suggested here, most notably improvements to taunt, disciplines, equipment power and availibility, it would be nice if warriors had some purpose outside of combat, or else some compensation for the fact that we are useless outside of a battle.  Most, if not all, classes in the game have something they can contribute out of combat, or a way to make money outside of camping items.  Casters can bind or cast other spells for money, and can work trade skills for profit.  Trying to work a profitable trade skill as a warrior is an exercise in futitily, and this applies to many of the other melee classes as well.  So while our equipment, which we are more dependent on that just about any other class, costs more than most other classes' equipment, as warriors we are perhaps the most poorly suited to making money.  And if we try to camp it, we must do so in a group, where chances are we will be rolling against 5 non-warriors who want the item to sell.  Either make warrior item drops much more common to drive the price down, give warriors a way to make more money, or make more warrior items no drop.  The only warrior items I've had luck getting are those that other classes could not loot and then sell.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I can understand that because most are on the Care Bear servers.<P>Everyone seems to have valid points, I like them all.<P>What about the class balance in PVP?<P>A caster can target you.. go invis run to a safe place in a dungeon and cast on you.. If you try to chase you train the place.<P>a caster can have a lev spell on run up a hill and run off it and cast on you.. you can neither hit them or shoot arrows at them.<P>Snare is insane.. try being snared for 10 min and fight somebody..<P>Try being cast on by a lvl 55 wiz and tell me how long you live.<P>Why arn't our Resists upped when we increase lvl's?<P>Unless your in a dungeon, a warrior will be kited around with no chance of winning outdoors in PVP.. especially since 90 percent of all non darks are druids...

</FONT><HR>Something for the low level warriors (haven't read the whole thread, so this might have been mentioned)<P>Increase the max cap on Bind Wound.  I'd like 75%, but even up 10% to 60% would do.  My warrior is currently level 30, and I still solo a good bit.  I soloed exclusively through 26, and that extra bind wound would have helped quite a bit.  It can also help relieve the healers at the low levels if you can take care of 20hp or so at a time for yourself so they can tend to more critically wounded patients.  That's the only improvement I can think of at lower levels.  Higher levels I'm not quite experienced enough with to make suggestions yet  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I do however have one complaint.<BR> <BR>My complaint is how damage is calculated on criticals and crippling blows.  Right now it is (weapon damage * 2 or 4)+ damage bonus.

</FONT><HR>Hmm...Well I've got a few ideas, some reposts, but this is my personal viewpoint on them:<P>TAUNT TAUNT TAUNT  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>1) Increase the taunt cap, and decrease the refresh rate on it.<BR>2) If at all possible, make taunt a point blank AoE. Its really rough trying to bounce among 3-4 targets, hitting and taunting each, to give the enchanter a chance to mez them - taunting is/should be visualized as the warrior doing everything possible to enrage his enemies - yelling, spitting, kicking dust, whatever. Why would this only bother a_froglok_putz01, and not his buddies that are right there with him?<P>2) Other skill caps: Umm....why are the piercing and archery caps lower than the other weapon skills? I'd like to see hand to hand and kicking raised, but as unarmed combat is more of a monk thing, I can see the justification for that... but what about bashing? Move it up a little more... and increase the chances of it inturrupting spell casting..<P>3) Make a sort of meditate type skill for healing faster, say...level 40, caps at 250, increases heal rate while sitting by...say... 1 point/tick for every 50 skill points? Not a big difference... but noticible in that high level warriors that get forced into a solo fight could have safer travelling - ie, Warrior Bob, level 50, has maxed his quickheal skill at 250. Bob logs in a while before his friends/guild, so that he can run from Karnors to Overthere and back. On the way he runs into a wurm that wants to eat him. Bob can solo this wurm pretty safely, but he's left with only 2 bubs of health. Thanks to Bob's Quickheal, he only needs to sit for 45 minutes to heal back to full health instead of almost 2 hours. Still a lot of downtime due to travelling solo, but not a ridiculous amount.<P>Finally, skill caps - Sure, I understand that the caps were raised when Kunark came out, for 51+ characters... but..from a realistic standpoint... Look at it this way. Most skills cap when you hit level 39, at 200 level. You stay at this skill level for a long time - 12 more levels of fighting where you learn nothing. Then, suddenly, when you hit 51, BOOM! Your skills go up to 250/252/etc for max.. Hmm...lemme see..rough calculation.. 45 points of offense...50 points of weapon skill..hm.. thats 95 points... times the modifiers.. somewhere aroudn 250 potential ATK rating boost...quite a huge potential jump going from 50 to 51.. and with  the level increase of mobs, especially in velious, 49/50 warriors have a lot of trouble hitting mobs that can be hit much easier by a 51 warrior.. sure, skills go up slowly, especially after 200 level... but with good equipment, and having a shaman and enchanter regularly grouping, str and dex can both be over 200, if not maxxed at 255, often enough for the skill gains to be reasonably fast.. Skills should be gradually gained throughout your 'career' as a master of combat - not capped early, then suddenly haveing a huge realm of improvement possible. This goes for all classes, btw, not just warriors....<P><BR>Theres my 2 cp...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm going to repeat things that have already been said, but I think its important enough that it is said, plus, im a paying customer too. :-)<P>---- Warrior Epic ----<BR>1) Chardok Queen blade should be 100% drop. This is not a question of difficulty or risk vs reward. It is a question of fairness and equality. The Prince/King mobs drop thier quest pieces EVERY time you kill them, the Queen should be the same way. There are enough rare spawn blocks in the way, this one is just not needed or fair.<P>2) 1h'ers delay need to be looked at. We aren't asking to out do every other epic, we are asking for 1-2 movements in Delay or Damage. Examples: 14/23, 15/24, 13/22, etc.<P>---- Item Drops ----<BR>It doesn't seem like "items" can be related to "class balance", but the fact of the matter is, a warriors "effectiveness" is a direct measurement of his equipment. <P>1) Increase drop rates on Cobalt Bracer/Helm, such that they enter the world at the same rate as the other class item drops of the same type.<P><BR>Grimdar Hillmover<BR>60th Dwarf Warlord<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Probably going to get some flames from the smaller races but here goes.<P>I have seen some mention on the stats and how they should affect those of a smaller race in regards to us larger races. Ex a wood elf with a dex of 150 compared to an ogre with a dex of 75 should be 10x faaster than the ogre. I partially agrre with this. The stats should be a big part of the warrior class but there should also be caps on what that class can reach. No way should you be able to get a Gnome warrior to be equal to an Ogre warrior in STR or STA. Likewise, no way an Ogre could match an Elf in DEX or AGI, an gnome in INT or WIS. We pay for that in size. Now if DEX and AGI did more to increase the AC of that race, then all the tanks wouldnt need an enormous amout of STR to carry the gear to increase their AC.<P>A solution to this could be that once the DEX/AGI stat of the smaller races increase above say 125, that it has more of an impact on their AC as well as more occurance of Dodge/Parry, and likewise, the higher the STR on an ogre/troll/barb, the more damage they are pulling out, and STA gives a higher bonus to HP's. Now some people are going to say but that means the larger races will have a mojor HP advantage than the smaller races, but if the smaller races dodges/parries are going off more, they get hit less so no need for the extra HP's.<P>Also, Bind Wound, please allows us to get further than 50% on this, as it is a joke. I only use this skill when my cleric or shaman is not around, and as is, i get to 1.2k hps, then have to sit for an hour to get the rest back before I can go and kill something again. If this had a say 2% bonus per level on HP's restored passed 25th lvl, it is not huge, but at leaset it will slowly progress till a level 50 can fully heal themselves. This will not unballance the game as we still either have to buy the bandages, costing us money earnt, or get them from a mage.<P>Dogstar Manasponge<BR>47th Lvl ogre Tank</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It's simple... warriors NEED TAUNT SKILL UNCAPPED post 50. Our taunt skill is BROKEN. Verant fixed 50+ mobs to allow our taunt to go through more often... NOT ENOUGH. All taunt needs to go though and it has to WORK. If I am going to be useless in melee and hit for 1/10th that of a monk and barely 2x as good compared to sk or pally and not be able to solo... then my taunt better be a powerful skill considering I'm the one with the HP/AC. That way maybe we can USE ALL KINDS of weapons WITHOUT WORRY OF TAUNT PROBLEMS! What good is it to have a higher skill cap than SK or pally in 2hs if we can't use them due to taunt problems post 50?<P>I don't even know why I hold weapons... We aren't the masters of combat (I dont mean skill caps I mean actual melee dmg all things considered) Frankly, I would be happy using rusty swords as long as my taunt button will keep the mob on me like it should.<P>I do not agree with everything in the link below, but there are some things listed on this forum that do need to be fixed:<P>http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showMessage?topicID=265.topic<P><BR>Here are some helpful things that WONT unbalance the warrior class vs. other melee classes-<P>----------------WARRIORS NEED----------------<P>* MORE HP<P>*** UNCAP WARRIOR TAUNT<P>** ALL WARRIORS NEED REGEN<P>*** MAKE TAUNT WORK EVEN BETTER POST 50<P>* MORE AC<P>** UNCAP BIND WOUND PRE 50 AND INCREASE IT POST 50<P>*** RACE SELECTION FOR WARRIOR IS TOO UNBALANCED <BR>(EVEN W/ EXP PENALTYS)<P>* WAR CRYS<P>----------------WARRIORS NEED----------------<P>* - important<BR>** - very important<BR>*** - prolly broken =p<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Most of these are condensed versions of what other people said.<BR>Idea #1.<BR>Fix taunt.  It does not taunt enough. <BR>Idea #2<BR>Enhanse Disarm.  Pretty much useless in kunark and velious.  Small taunt but not big enough.<BR>Idea #3<BR>Enhance HP and AC. You have enhanced everyone's ac and hp like pally ranger sk but ours. <BR>Idea #4<BR>Warrior epic.  Maestro hand and anchient blade reduced in rarity, maybe more incentive for people to do them.  Maybe better loot on queen and Maestro. And I should not have to cash in 6-7k for the rebreathers.  Make them less expensive or replace with another item. Risk vs Reward is ok but seeing all the easier quests with haste why don't we get anything that powerful.  <BR>Idea #5 <BR>Indocite drops<BR>They are rare.  Out of tons of time in hate I have seen several full sets of cleric, enchanter, mage.  I have not seen legs, bp drop.

</FONT><HR>I play a 51 warrior on Mith Marr so I know a bit what I'm talking about. Here would be my changes since we are tanks they need to be enhanced in my opinion.<P>1)Taunt needs to be better. We can be outdamaged by monks, rogues, and even sk's and rangers if they stick their spells. Hard to taunt things off when you are being outclasses in the damage department by almost everyone. I would like to do more damage in combat which leads to #2.<P>2) Make crit hits more prevalent say post 40.<P>3) More hp's. MOBS's post 50 do SO much damage in the 100's of damage per hit it is impossible for a cleric to keep up with damage. A huge hp boost post 40 or 50 would be appropriate.<P>4)Make warrior equipment a little more easier to get. Since we are the most equipment dependant class it should be perhaps a little easier for us to obtain some items. ie cobalt bracers are extremely rare when they should not be etc.<P>5) Warrior epic is insane to get and not that great when compared to some of the others. ie no haste.<P>6) Pierce skill caps lower than the other weapon skills? Why? We are supposedly the master of weapons!<P>7) We need something more to distinguish ourslves from the others! Another skill, more disciplines, something! (a 51 discpline would be a start). Crits were a nice idea til you gave then to almost everyone and they become non-effective at higher lvls only giving us a dam bonus of something like 1 or 2 percent. Very litle indeed.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, my main character is a 33 warrior.  So far I've found him a great class to play but I do have some suggestions.<P><BR>(I'm seriously going to repeat here)<P>1) The AE taunt that has been suggested would be great because I've been in tons of situations where I couldn't save a friend due to me already beating on something else and trying to taunt the other thing off him.<P>2) Maybe speed up our running just a tad?  Nothing like a Jboot-type speed but just a little faster.  We're supposed to be strong no? So shouldn't we run faster?<P>3) The War Cry that has been mentioned would be pretty cool.<P>Other than that I don't know, I like my warrior (a bit poor but still) and he's a fun char to play.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Maybe AOE taunt or more discs.  Cripling blow should happen alot more when you beserk. Same with critical hits.  Most of time when i do critical its like 40-50 dammage or 30 on a kick.  Whats critical about that?<BR>The risk vs reward on epic is TOTALLY off compared to risk vs reward of other weapons.

</FONT><HR>I don't play a warrior and I never have.  But I have some suggestions anyway.<P>Warriors should have some sort of AE (area effect) taunt.  Not an attack really, just some way to get the attention of all the monsters in the area.  Not for their sake, but for the sake of everyone else they group with.<P>Warriors should also have some sort of AE attack.  Think of it... 1) it would be a way to make them more versatile 2) it would increase their power in a general sense, without overpowering them in raids and epic battles 3) it's quite consistent with the introduction of high level AE spells to many of the spellcasting classes lately.<P>More armors should have sizes, like crafted and fine steel and banded and bronze do.  There's already a difference in stats between halfling warriors and ogre warriors... the halfling and ogre should *never* have to wear armor with equal weight.  This is a basic assumption made by everyone who creates a small race-warrior and it has been part of the game design since its earliest inception -- small races should wear small armor.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well I don't play a warrior, but I'll go ahead and throw my comments in.  What I hear from the posts above is that taunt should be improved.  The image I get is someone making clever pointed digs to anger the mob.  Doing it well actually requires some intelligence.  So how about adding and int test to see whether the taunt stuck.  This might require some decisions about what sort of gear to acquire and make for some interesting tradeoffs.  Just a thought.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Warriors are one of the most powerfull classes in Everquest, but i still have some suggestions to make:<P>Hitpoints and Armorclass: Well equiped Paladins and Shadowknights nearly reach the level of HPs and AC my well equipped 59 Barbarian Warrior has. I suggest a slight increase on AC and a major increase in hitpoints (5k HPs buffed isnt much when tanking mobs that quad for 800, and tanking is the only thing warriors are good for)<P>Disciplines: Replace the disciplines where you do more dmg but also take more, this just isnt suitable for the maintank. Give warriors disciplines against magic attacks instead.<P>Epicweapon: 14dmg 24 delay for the epicweapon and no haste?? blade of black dragon eye has 14/24 too (thats prolly why you replaced it with the 13/24 blade of green dragon eye). Please either change the delay to ~21 or make it have perm. 40% haste (on the 1handers) or give it a slow/dot proc like the rangerepic. This weapon is pathetic for a epicweapon, all other other epicweapons (well the fiery defender is bad too) are a big improvement to dropped weapons except Veeshans Peak or SoV bossmobs and its too slow to be a usefull taunt. This weapon also is NOT class defining (it doesnt even have AC, rofl).<P>PoG Armorlooks: Barbarian Warriors look like Dschingis Khan in PoG armor, please change the look =)<P>Taunt: Taunt was improved and works much better now, but it does not work the way it did before Kunark. I always use the begging skill while fighting to keep the mobs on me, raise the skillcap to 250 and make taunt an area effect for warriors level 55+.<P><BR>Many of these suggestions are prolly just dreams of a frustrated warrior, but please change the epicweapon, having 2 1handers and a 2hander doesnt justify giving them such a bad dmg/delay ratio.<P>Eichelbogubk Morrigan, 59 Myrmidon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My theory on taunt and what it *should* be:<P>It should be based only on taunt skill and dmg done. Not the frequency of damage -- just damage done. Not procs -- these reduce taunting to luck! -- but damage done. That way a warrior could equip his most damaging weapon without worrying about the 1h vs 2h taunt factor. Why put a bunch of 2h weapons in the game that look cool when we're worried about taunt! <P>This would be a great, balancing improvement to warriors.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Someone suggested that we be able to "Trade In" planar armor for an iksar wearable version and i really like this idea. As far as the new PoG armor goes, i am not in an guild capable of going to PoG and I seriously doubt that i can get a pick up group for PoG, and even in the even that i did (yeah right) i more than likely would not get any because all the other warriors in the guild that invited me will come first. I would just like to see more armor that iksar can wear added to the game with equal the ac of plate.

</FONT><HR>I have played a warrior since day one and I must say it is a fine class over all with two issues which could improve this classes overall balance:<P>1) Taunt - this has been covered in other posts but I want to make sure it gets looked at. It has very little advantage to have the highest AC and HP in the game only to have the mob beat the heck out of the monk while you helplessly push the taunt button over and over. I know you don't want to discuss epics in these threads but this ties into the taunt problem directly. Our epic weapon is too slow and procs the wrong spell. Now don't get me wrong it is a very nice weapon but our primary purpose is to take damage. We can't do that without being able to get the mobs attention. To do that we need fast weapons and agro creating procs.<P>2) Equipment - Out of all classes warriors are the most dependent on equipment. We have no mana, we have no fd, we have no sneak, hide or other skills and we have no songs. All we can offer a group is the highest AC and HP. Warriors should have the best equipment in the game. Also, it is important to note that at any large hunt there is a large number of warriors present. What I am trying to say is this: please increase the quality and the frequency of the warrior item drops. <P>This is a very good class outside these two issues.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>** When it comes to travel I have found it to be that the warrior is, by far, at the biggest disadvantage than any other class.  I know this has been said before but I can't reiterate this enough.  The Old World was fine, but with Velious it is a death wish for me to try and get to Thurgadin from Iceclad 80% of the time.  Then there is the problem of getting from Thurgadin to Iceclad nekkid, sometimes without SoW.  Recently I have been plunged into mini death-loops and almost everytime it has involved a trip from Thurg./Kael to Iceclad or vice versa.<P>   I see no reason why a warrior, who will die many times in his/her career can not grasp the ability to Feign Death ATLEAST.  If a opossum is smart enough why not a warrior? (no jokes on warrior INT please  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Monks, Necros, SKs all get Feign Death so I cannot see how it could be "stepping on another classe's toes."  With no mend, invis, heal, sow/speed, sneak-hide I would at least think this to be feasible.  A good approach would be to put a lower skill cap on FD for warriors.  A truly good warrior knows when he can't handle a situation.  Warriors just aren't the best at running, esp in the HUGE Velious zones (we're kinda slow).  That's my Beef with warriors at the moment. Here's an easy list:<P>   *** A slight increase in HP/AC, for Velious<BR>       encounters this is justified  <BR>   <BR>   *** Feign Death type skill with maybe a lower<BR>       cap (the HP/AC bonus would help with<BR>       the failures atleast)<BR>   <BR>   *** Maybe a +1 hp per tick bonus every 10/15<BR>       levels<BR>   <BR>   *** DEFINATELY INCREASE OUR TAUNT!!!  With 2<BR>       Cane of the Tranquils and a FBSS I STILL<BR>       find it VERY hard to keep mobs aggro'ing me<BR>       AE TAUNT sounds nice  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>   *** Please look into Bind Wound.  Maybe at lvl<BR>       35 or 40 give us (warriors) and other melee<BR>       classes "BANDAGE WOUND" which as skill <BR>       increases every 50 points, your max<BR>       "BANDAGEABLE" HP will increase 5%.<BR>       You'll still need bandages, and you would<BR>       have to work on 2 skills.  Is this work-<BR>       able? This would lessen the need for<BR>       the increased regen mentioned above and<BR>       in other posts while making it so that<BR>       you will have to work extra hard to be<BR>       able to attain the new ablilty because<BR>       it is a skill that needs to be maxed.<BR>       In turn this could also solve the no<BR>       new skill (but Disarm hehe) after lvl 25<BR>       along with a limited form of Feign Death.<P>While we are here to only make suggestions I hope these are not considered far-fetched ideas.  If something is unbalancing about these I'm sure the Dev. Team could find a way to balance them without making them completely unfeasible at the same time right?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Thank you for listening.

</FONT><HR>First, the epic -- it aint.<P>The 2H one has a nice ratio, but I've heard rumors of better.<P>Both of the 1H'ers can be beat by drops off blues and such in dragon necropolis (info from a 57+ warrior).<P>Most of the other epics are good enough that one would not be using another weapon... period. The relative difficulty of the quests is completely laughable as well, ours requires drops from Kunark dragons, which can be somewhat rare, and a rare drop from the Maestro. Add on top of that having to slaughter the queen, and you have a damned hard quest.<P>They need to be fixed to be somewhat worth the risk involved. 2H could use getting beefed to one of the monk staves, 36/38 or so would be nice.<P>The 1H'ers need their delay reduced so they can outdamage other more easily attainable combos, and taunt better than a lamentation.<P>The Tempered Velium Claymore has a better ratio than the epic, 32/35, about 1.09. Monks get items with the sick ratio of 0.875. Give us a 2H with a straight 1.0 ratio. 40/40 would be nice.<P>There are no less than 11 1H weapons with a better ratio than ours. About 3 of them are warrior usable, and two more are epics for the other two dual wielding slashers. The Wurmslayer beats our epic quite well on straight up melee damage. Putting them at about 18/22 would be about right I think.<P>2H vs 1H -- you need to look into this. Right now 1H so overpowers 2H it's sickening. 1H both does more damage AND taunts more effectively due to the greater number of attacks. This should be fixed so that they are about equal once again.<P>The wurmslayer was the last straw on this. You get the damage output of a quite decent 2H (Razing Sword of Skarlon) PLUS the damage of the offhand. That was an insult to all 2H using warriors in the game. Your "fix" to help 2H vs obscenely low delay 1H'ers helped the wurmslayer as well.<P>Critical hits (and crippling blows) are so rare using 2H as to be ignored, and most of the time hit for less than a maximum hit normal slash. 3/4 of my crippling blows with a Soul Leech are for less than 150. Most of them hit for about 120, after the 18 point level/str bonus. That's the Cripplers. Most of my criticals (ignoring bashes, which make up about 30% of both) hit at least as hard as my cripplers, if not harder. They also happen about once every 6 fights.<P>Let's compare someone dual wielding two lamentations for instance, vs a Jagged Blade of War.<P>Unhasted, the JBoW is going to swing once every 3.6 seconds. The Lamentations are going to swing every 1.9. Throwing double attack into the equation, that's 2 possible hits for the JBoW, 8 for the lamentations. On average the lamentations are going to have 4X as many crits. Usual crit with a lammy ends up at about 45-60, usual with the JBoW is probably about 120, going by an avg crit of 100 at damage 30. Triple attack at 60 doesn't help this any at all.<P>In terms of raw damage, the problem is due to the "sweet spot" damage range of a lamentation being between about 20 and 35, where a Soul Leech is about 60-120. The total ranges for them are about 9-50 and 21-135 respectively. They miss about the same regardless. Misses with a lammy do not hurt total output NEAR as much as misses with a Soul Leech. Minimum hits with a lamentation do not hurt total output NEAR as much as minimum hits with a Soul Leech.<P>2H damage output flys all over the board at the moment, whereas 1H is typically fairly constant. At the very least, make the minimum hit with a weapon equal to the weapon's rated damage, my minimum has been around 20 no matter WHAT 2H I use. The range of values needs to be tightened.<P>The wurmslayer gets you the damage output of a good 2H plus the advantage of an offhand weapon, for 5k or a few hours questing if you're lucky on drops.<P>The sheer number of attacks the 1H'ers generate also allow them to taunt better.<P>2H should be better at one of these, either damage or taunting. Please get a real warrior to play and test these, because the current quest rewards and such haven't indicated that you are.<P>If rumors are true, and the cast time on a cobalt breastplate is 34 seconds, then it needs to be lowered. At 34 seconds, a fungi tunic heals you faster, doesn't require you to stand completely still, and works mid-fight in a number of cases. Remember that we cannot move at all during the cast, and hotkeys are disabled. Also consider that we have NO channeling skill, so there is no chance of us recovering if we get hit.<P>The various warrior related quests and such are laughable, and some downright insulting in terms of risk/reward. The epic and wurmslayer come to mind, especially when compared with items you can acquire by camping various static spawns in sebilis and velious dungeons.<P>Overall, I'm quite happy with the class as is. My main wish is that 2H be just as viable as 1H, so I dont' end up looking like every other warrior on the server, and dualwielding a lammy/wurmslayer and a CSS or some other decent offhand.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hmmm lets see.<P>First point is that warriors and all melee classes need a skill that would help them regenerate hp at a faster rate.  Casters get a skill to regenerate mana at a ratio to their total melee classes should as well.  Having the same hp regeneration at level 10 as you do at level 50 is wrong.  We are dependant on other classes enough, we cant kill anything solo and we have to beg for heals if we get hurt during travel.  This would help downtime because we could regenerate our hp between battles while casters are regenerating mana.  This skill should be for all melee classes.<P>Also for all non binding classes, we need to be able to get bound outdoors.  We are still dependant on others, we still cant pop in a dungeon.  It also reduces downtime while you wait for your tank to come back from death.  (we need downtime reduction in most area's of the game)<P>Warriors need more mid level quests.  They need something added to the 30-49 range.  It gets very dull.  Perhaps items with effects that arent the same as great as the uber items.  <P>Well I got a hundred other ideas.... but im way late for bed, Ill post again if its still open.<P>trav</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'll throw this out. Melee classes (warrior, monk rogue) should have their HPs be based off their -current- stamina. Just as casters have mana based off their int or wis. Give a melee class HPs equal to sta * (lvl/4) or something like that. This would allow players to have more proportional HPs.<P>Anybody dig this?<P>-Daemon Sleyr-</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yeah, honestly I'd like to see us regenerating more hps (this is the important part) WHILE SITTING DOWN.  As in, not in battle.  I'm level 52 with approximately 2300 hps  (yeah, I know, my stamina sucks, leave me alone)  To regen to full health while sitting takes me roughly 46 minutes to regen fully.  23 if I have enough bandages to bind wound to half (this alone, with 120 BW or whatever my skill is now, takes several minutes)  <P>Now let's say it only took me 10 minutes to regen completely. Would this make me a soloing machine?  Hardly.  If the increased regen only took effect while sitting down (re:  meditation) then I'd still have the same amount of chances dying in battle.  In most cases I have a good deal of difficulty soloing a blue (low blue)  On high blues, I stand little to no chance.  Basically all this would do is help reduce downtime in a group a little.  <P>It wouldn't unbalance us, and it wouldn't be a drastic change in the way the class is played.  I might even be able to solo a blue every 10 minutes.. (that's six an hour) Like I said, it won't make warriors a soloing class, except maybe while we're sitting around waiting to find a group.  It would just make downtime go a little faster - and it's my understanding that that's why you're going for right now anyway.<P>Thanks<P>Sinogue<BR>Champion of the Tribunal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 9 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052809&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052809&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
