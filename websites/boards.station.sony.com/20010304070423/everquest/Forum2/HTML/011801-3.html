</FONT><HR>I ditched my bard last August when this line of spells stopped working.  I couldn't melee too well so that was kinda boring....  I couldnt tank yet most everything would be mad at me for singing... so that was kinda un-fun... I could buff the party with stat increases, yet we all know stats do not affect the outcome of a battle significantly in the small quantities that a bard can increase them,  I could haste the party with my songs but in a party with 6 people (of which 2 were probably tanks), it was better for me to sing manasong to let the casters nuke 1 or 2 more times per battle....<P>manasong<P>And since it is pulse based and non-stackable you gotta keep it on all the time.<P>that's all I did in group situations<BR>that's all the groups wanted<P>manasong!<BR>manasong!<BR>manasong!<BR>manasong!<P>I have nightmares to this day.<P>Between my partner and I, we have played almost every high level class in this game 50+.  Of those classes I would say if you want the most boring job in the game, play a bard.   You can run fast and you can play the manasong. You USED to be able to do all sorts of cool stuff like control a pull of 3 or 4 monsters IF AND ONLY IF you wanted to dedicate yourself fully to controlling those monsters.   That was the tradeoff.   Now... you can't mez snakes and bats in the newbie area, let alone level 40+ monsters in kunark.   Necros can now do this though  : )<P>I really loved playing my bard.  Bard is still one of the easier classes to solo to 50 because of their charm song (unless that has been nerfed too, I haven't kept up).  I am quite bitter at what the class has now become, though.  For the class that is supposed to be the best at aiding a party, it is most often the least wanted. (other than the poor rangers : P )<P>Just go make a druid like I did.   You will be MUCH happier.

</FONT><HR>"There's nothing unintentional about the way that lullaby is currently working."<P>Do you realize that this song is as effective a suicide as trying to solo Vox?  At lvl 21, 99 times out of 100 if I try to use this song I die horribly, and this is on lvl 18 or so mobs.  From the moment a bard gets this song it is utterly devoid of use.  It makes you die, it has no positive benefit, it is the bards swan song.

</FONT><HR>One thing that really gets me about this whole thing, is that mez songs are the ONLY songs that make SENSE for a Bard to be good at!  Think about it..a song makes you sleepy so you don't fight...makes sense right?  How about a song that makes you float?  Makes you breathe underwater?  That doesn't make much sense does it?  Yet, in EQ Bard songs can do these things but their mez line is practically unusable, especially at high levels??  That seems totally backwards!  In UO, Bard songs are the ONLY mind-controlling spells in the game!  Bard songs are Traditionally mind-control oriented, yet because of EQ having Enchanters the Bard songs are focused on other things instead.  Does anyone else think this is weird?  It has always bothered me.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Um, Gordon why dont you go ask GZ about his quote rather than questioning your customers about its context?<BR>He is what? down the hall from you?<P>Im most appalled by the fact that the bard community had to explain to a Verant employee how the class functions. Ester still didnt have it right from all the communications I saw.<P>It seems pretty clear to me you guys screwed up putting the song in the game in the first place becuase you thought it was too powerful and were too busy programming lizardmen to take the damn thing out. Instead you just nerfed it. Easier that way. So you strung the bardic community on for months and months letting us think that it was broken. Shame on you.<P>Your comment about reducing its effectiveness because it uses no mana is so ridiculas I dont even know how to respond to that point.<BR>Its effectiveness has been reduced to ZERO.<BR>Again, if you felt the song was unbalancing take the bloody thing out and replace it with something else that actually does something or<BR>give the stupid song a mana drain on the bard.<P>Either you guys dont know your own product at all or you have been just stringing us along the entire time or you just dont care about your customers.<P>Bah whats the use. <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Reading the last part of my post isnt entirely clear. What I mean to say is... Fine bards song dont take mana to mez. Okay we understand that. Give bards the enchanter mez spells 10 levels behind enchanters and charge us the same amount of mana it costs them, or slightly more, but also give us their duration as well. Would that imbalance the game? Due to the small amount of bards around, and less all the time.

</FONT><HR>One of the first truly amazing things I saw in the world of Norrath was while being guided by a druid from Freeport to Qeynos as a level 5 Wizard.  I saw my first Griffin in flight. I was amazed.<P>  Later, after quitting that wizard at level 8 and starting a druid of my own, I saw and experienced the second.  I watched a young Sister of Song risk her very life and limb controlling a crowd of goblins deep inside the home of Clan Runnyeye while her group members fought desperately to survive.  We won that fight because of teamwork and the talents of the bard, plain and simple, and again I was amazed.<P>A month later we found ourselves again deep in the goblins lair.. only this time to be wiped out completely and totally.  What changed?  The group was basically the same classwise, working the same area that they previously had been able to hold, using the same skills/spells/songs as before, with the only difference being the group was a few levels higher.  Or so we thought.  Our "Nod tactic" had been rendered comparitively worthless by "The Vision", whatever monsterous creation that might be.<P>Whatever VI.  If your "Vision" is to drive away some of THE best people in Norrath, then I must congratulate you, because you are succeeding. And I don't just speak of the more musically oriented individuals either, as I know many of Norraths most competent adventurers have already retired for one reason or another, but usually related to some part of the aforementioned "Vision".<P>For all your talk about the allmighty Vision..  you folks sure are about as blind as a bat outside West Freeport.<P>Xunil Darkwood<BR>Grail Brotherhood<BR>Druid of Tunare<BR>Music Lover</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>&gt;If you still don't accept that, then I'll also tell you that GZ was involved in the latest round of testing.<P>GZ should remember the context of the comments he made regarding the resist rates several people have brought up.  Did your testing show something had changed from then?  Or has his vision changed?<P>&gt;There is no way that we can make a no-mana song as powerful as a mez as good as a spell that uses mana, which is the reason that it was changed to its current state last August or so.<P>I can understand this in regards to exp twinking, so the second resist check was added so even green stuff resists regularly.  But at higher levels, have 1 of 3 mobs, at a minimum, beating on the bard each round makes the song effectively useless.  <P>If it is intended that this particular song is useless above L25, and the manaless nature is the main problem, how about making a L49 song an upgraded AOE mez, without the secondary resist, but have it use mana.  It would be then a quite similar upgrade as the charm upgrade, and it would make bard CC useful for the rare emergency 5-pull, but unable to be a full-time big pull controller.<P>&gt;Chains had the power to reduce the effective movement of a fleeing NPC to zero, causing it to be an effective root. However, were an actual root spell used, the NPC would have fought having no other option available (fight or flight). It had fleeing mobs at a dead stop, yet not fighting back.<P>All snare-effects allow this tho.  Druid snare, necro dark, bard chains, and the tricky debuff/encumbrance trick.  Bard chains started working 1 bubble before druid snare, but NOT at full hp.  If you say that was deserving of a nerf, I think you're carving the class-distinction line a little thin.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>When a class gets the obvious support of the general EQ public (and you know how rare that is) then you know something is wrong. Bards are the weakest and buggiest classes there is and they are being further weakened and short changed for no reason, for no gain. It is wrong and should be addressed.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;There are enough posts here and on Bard sites that highlight the problems, you dont need to be a rocket scientist to do the testing, you just need the time and resources and i bet that is the cause of 95% of the problems that the non 'grass is greener' posts highlight which end up getting ignored or snubbed. People shouldnt have to dump a class because they feel they are getting no support, its plain wrong.<P>Thank you Byph<P>Kerouac Dharmabum<P>lvl49 bard - with less than 30 useful songs...<P>and more and more deciding that I have but one purpose to fill in a group, done by singing one song...<P>it's sad!<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;There is no way that we can make a no-mana song as powerful as a mez as good as a spell that uses mana, which is the reason that it was changed to its current state last August or so.&lt;&lt;<P>1.  With clarity, enchanters can mez a couple of mobs and still keep their mana up.<P>2.  This *isn't* as good as a mez - the duration is so short that if you are bashed once, *everything* is waking up on the next tick.  The ludicrous resist rates just make this more likely.<P>&gt;&gt;and I think that most people here know that I own up to them.<BR>&lt;&lt;<P>I am sure I have seen you own up to some, but I have yet to see you comment on how you handled snare:<BR>1.  Gee, that shouldn't have been effected by the change.<BR>2.  I don't understand why bards are complaining about snare.<BR>3.  Oh yeah, we decided it was too powerful. <P>Number 2 is the important one there, and the fact that we had to wait for someone else to ask tangential question before we found out the answer we had been waiting for for a month or two.<P>&gt;&gt;What is at your disposal? What can you do? Where can you excel? &lt;&lt; <BR>I think the fear here is that the next thing we are found to excel at will be taken away from us.<P>&gt;&gt;part warrior, part rogue, part enchanter, part druid, and part shaman&lt;&lt;<BR>Actually you can probably drop the part warrior and part druid bits.<P>&gt;&gt;Chains had the power to reduce the effective movement of a fleeing NPC to zero&lt;&lt;<P>*ALL* snares do this, please get a better line. Bard snare happened to do it a little better than the others, but the trade off being it had a very short, random duration and you could only use it effectively on one mob.  <P>Now it is worse than the level 1 druid snare which uses insignificant mana at the levels  chains was 'too powerful' at, could be cast on multiple mobs, and usually lasted upwards of 2 minutes.  It is also less resistable because it doesn't have chains dual effect.  And Chains, despite the nerf, still overwrites the better snares so we can't even use it for the attack speed debuff without overwriting a better snare.<P>If one snare had to be the best, why *not* the highly resistable, shortest duration, random duration, only usable on one mob at a time, bard snare?  And as someone pointed out, despite its dual effect, the effects were not useful at the same time:  Attack speed debuff when the mob is attacking, movement debuff when it flees.<P>&gt;&gt;They aren't completely useless, just reduced in usefulness once the targets go over level 30. &lt;&lt;<P>Even pre-30, it is reduced to an AoE, zero second stun that *might* mez a mob before you get pounded on.  <P>&gt;&gt;That said, we're not opposed to revisiting pixie strike and twilight to see if they need to be changed positively now that we know that lullaby is working correctly.<BR>&lt;&lt;<P>Please do, these songs can never* be as good as an enchanter mez because, due to the duration, the bard can *only* mez three creatures, tops.  And that is with 0 resists.<P>One thing I will agree with though, if I leave EQ, it will be because I am getting bored with the whole thing and not because of bard nerfs, though such things don't help, that's for sure.<P>Mike</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I had posted earlier without reading everything. So Lullabye is crappy by design: a high resist rate because it uses no mana.<P>Are Kaearia's numbers on mana regen and spell cost accurate Abshi? Can an enchanter or necro with clarity actually gain mana while only mezzing? <P>If so then your assertion that a manaless mesmerize song must have a high resist rate to balance it is wrong. <P>I have some serious thinking to do. I have played my bard for the past 20 levels or so without Lullabye. Can I go to 60 without it, but knowing that it doesn't work because of reasoning I strongly disagree with?<P>No one expects me to crowd control, the ability has withered so long. But I know those songs are there, but balanced into uselessness. A cruel taunting presence. I feel incomplete as a bard, like I'm not living up to my potential. I'm a jack of all trades that's missing one of the most important trades of all: Crowd Control. If I cannot lower my expectations of my class then it's goodbye.<P>I think I might head over to butcherblock and test pixie strike against a snake tommorrow if the boats are still broken on Rodcet and the GM's are still summoning people back and forth. Maybe if pixie works well enough against them I'll try it in the CoM.

Admittedly, bards are rare, but they aren't rare enough so that you can have missed them running around strumming a drum for over a year!!!  <P>"we don't have anything that looks like a drum when held"<P>Of course the game doesn't.  That's why I'm complaining about this minor issue that is eminently fixable and has been for over a year.  At least make us look good while we run by people, as it is the one thing we can do best.<P>Every time I have played lullaby on any experience giving group of mobs larger than 3, I have gotten the snot kicked out of me.  Bards can't take a beating, we don't have the HP nor AC.  So when we play lullaby, and there are 3 mobs, 1 of them will constantly be beating on me.  1 bash = 3 mobs beating on me.  <P>This is purely anecdotal of course, but the evidence is there in over 100 posts.  <P>Why not compromise with us unhappy bards and make the song take mana?  Then you have a similar song to the enchanter and we can't regenerate mana through any means except time.  Bards still have less ability then enchanters, but aren't utterly useless at crowd control.<P>Wow I solved the problem. <P>Role-playing wise, it makes no sense that a Bard doesn't get better at enchanting people.  I can sing better, play my instruments better, and I certainly look better.  So why does that dang snake have a similar ability to ignore my song?   <P>Personally, I think you guys need 4 or 5 more PR people to monitor these boards.  You have 300K customers, maybe a few percent post here.  1 PR rep for all the general complaints just don't cut it.  <P>   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

It can be a charge that certain statements are false and possibly decpetive.<P>Now I do not know what the original poster's intent was, but your "statement of fact" notwithstanding, I think Verant has a long history of being less then forthcoming with it's customers. If you wish I will be more than happy to show situations where we were told things that were not 100% true and were often misleading. Now who knows if those statements were made with intent to mislead or deceive...only the speakers know that for sure. What I do know is that there is a credibility gap and it didn't come from the customers.<P>You also took the statement regarding lying out of context. Personally I don't see how presenting facts that prove that someone you are paying for a service is flaming. Perhaps my definition of flaming is different. I don't consider well thought out, fact based arguments to be flames. I consider those to be "well thought out arguements." <P>Anyway, regarding bards specifically I now know 2 level 48+ bards who have been playing since beta who are cancelling their accounts.

</FONT><HR>As Kaearia has put on other threads:<P>Bard mez songs (Lullaby, Pixie Strike, Twilight) have two resists. The first is your ordinary resist that all songs/spells get. The second resist is something GZ threw in only for bard mez. When a bard tries to mez a mob, three things can happen:<P>1) The mob succeeds its first resist check and the song doesn't work. Message:<P>"Mob resisted your &lt;song name&gt;."<P>2) The mob fails its first resist check, but succeeds its second resist check and the song doesn't work. Message:<P>"Mob's head nods."<BR>"Mob resists your attempt to mesmerize it."<P>3) The song is not resisted and works. Message:<P>"Mob's head nods."<P><BR>This message is buggy, faulty, and might be whats causing the confusion between the different groups of folks doing testing.

Rogues seem to have been enhanced well in the last few months.  Bards didn't receive the upgrades of that parent class.  Bards are as close to warriors as wizards are to clerics (completely different at any level beyond 5).  Druid??? Huh?  I don't see any druid abilities at all.  Maybe a shaman, with ability buffing, but shaman + rogue + broken enchanter != bard.  <P>Nothing else really compares.  Maybe someone should really look into the bugs of this class before you kill it through a combination of inattention and shoddy testing of patches.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ok, So I can take the Mez Songs not working. I never had the Snare and Lullaby songs Pre-nerf anyway, cuz I'm a post-Kunark n00b type person.<P>But What I want is the Ability to melee decently beyond level 20 or so. Here I am, fighting Pickclaw Lookouts and Guards in Highpass. Theres a full group, A Cleric, A Warrior, A druid, an Enchanter, A Shaman, and Myself. Anyway, We're fighting a Guard, and I'm tearing into with my Thulian Claws (A Gift from someone, I'm not a twink at all, This is my first char) and Polished Granite Tomahawk, Getting 8-12 Damage per swipe I'd say. Meanwhile, The Shaman (Also untwinked, Wearing mostly chain and leather) picks up his Hammer and is doing 20-36 damage a swipe. Yep, I'm getting outdamaged by a Shaman. Also, My Songs are aggroing the Guard on me, So The Cleric is busy healing me after about 15 seconds because I'm down to Half Health cuz the Warrior is having a Hard time taunting it off me. <P>Anyway, I miss being able to Melee. Give Bards the Ability to Melee as well as an SK or Paladin beyond level 20 or so, And I'll be mostly happy again. Maybe you could start by moving Parry and Riposte down about 30 levels?<P>On the Plus side, I really like my Inkie Mask and I can't wait to get the er00d Mask.<P>Dalakar Daystar<BR>Bard of Passion<BR>Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>And another thing!<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;What are the parent classes for Bards?<P>Bards are not really hybrids despite having the same experience table. They are a class all to their own. If I had to name something, I'd call them part warrior, part rogue, part enchanter, part druid, and part shaman.<P>1)A bard can't melee effectively after lvl 20, and can NEVER tank! Part warrior?<P>2)A bard has sneak & hide, pick locks, and disarm traps.  Sneak & hide are useless, since we get an invis song.  Pick locks is useless, since higher lvl dungeons doors are only pickable by rogues. And disarm traps - LOL! part rogue?<P>3)A bard has a mezz affect song that is meant to be useless on 30+ lvl mobs - IN THEORY - but the song is actually useless at virtually ALL lvls.  A targeted mezz which is basically the same.  And some nerfed charming abilities.  Oh, the mana song!  No crowd control abilities beyond a 2 mob pull? Part enchanter - a VERY small part!<P>4) A bard has s traveling song that does not cross over a zone line - like sow, DoT's & regen healing, and almost insignificant direct damage songs.  A druid happens to do all these things better than bards, and gate.  Part druid?<P>5) A bard has party buffs, as long as the group stays within range, and songs are twisted accurately.  No pet/companions, no gate... part shaman?<P>What are we a combination of again?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>First, to all the trolls and whatnot, Abashi included, who are dismissing people canceling the accounts over this one song, thats not really the case. The upset over this song started oh, 10 months ago? Without a word, Verant put a secondary resist on Lullaby. Bards were all very upset as a very usful backup crowd control song was now junk, constant pestering resulted in that oft quoted test with GZ. In my opinion, GZ was very deceitful in that test, just saying that we should be seeing a secondary resist, never letting on that the second resist had only recently been added. So then a while goes by with the new message, now we at least see them resisting a lot, but why is the primary resist generall under 10% and the secondary resist over 35%? Especially taking into account GZ's comment about the 35% against whites, lower with higher CHA, none of which holds true OVER or UNDER level 30! So then finally a month and a half ago(?) Ester is gonna test all these bard issues... and delay after delay finally we get... working as intended. Thats the upset, almost a year of being jerked around on this one issue (and countless other nerfs coming up in the interum!). I don't know about placing blame on Ester or Abashi, but from here it looks like some hackney kind of comedic bad cop, worse cop routine. It might be laughable if I hadn't chosen to play a bard.<P>Abashi, you've said in other threads that you know little to nothing about Bards, you don't even know what it looks like when they hold a drum! I'd like to know how you've come to the conclusion that Bards are Nifty. <P>Well anyway, theres going to be a lot less of those nifty bards around. And please try not to trivialize it by saying it's just one song and they're probably just burnt out and looking for an excuse. It's a history of shoddy mishandling and misunderstaning of the Bard class on Verants part thats upset so many people.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ehh.... I have a bard, a ranger and rogue in permanent cold storage right now. Well, not the rogue, I use him as a clothes horse to wear the complete set of BI armor that I have handy.<P>The point being is that VI never really bothered to explain correctly what the hidden agenda of the Vision(tm) was as related to the various classes. A prime example is the Rogue and the Bard. Now that VI has tipped their hand and stated in no uncertain terms that this is a perma-nerfed support class a lot of people are very unhappy. <P>Well, no wonder! they just spent 30+ played days slogging through nerf hell to find that out! So much for the mystery of the Vision(tm). Same with the Rogue I guess. No wonder with the mystery of the Vision(tm). I have no doubt, fully reaveled, it would be a sullen anti-player monster.<P>Anyway, I'm glad to see that VI and Abashi is working very hard to shallow out the loyalty base for the company.

</FONT><HR>Wow! I like the sound of this text!<P>"That said, we're not opposed to revisiting pixie strike and twilight to see if they need to be changed positively now that we know that lullaby is working correctly."<P>I would encourage you to pursue this.  At higher levels it would be good for everyone if a bard was able to confidently mez 2 - 3 mobs (perhaps a lower resist rate and longer duration based on charisma)<P>Although it would not use mana it would suck up the bards resources making him take an active/hectic role in crowd control. Thus dropping mana regen, defensive focus, damage output, whatever previous role was being filled.  It would be another tool in the box, pick the one we feel would be most useful for the situation.  I like options.<P>If this is looked into please also consider the way it would work with enchanter crowd control abilities.  I enjoy playing with enchanters, bard/enchanter crowd control teams are really fun. (plug: please give me taunt instead of riposte hehe)<P>I guess seeing everyone resort to rooting off targets when no enchanter is available just gets old after a while.  Especially since we have mana and can only charm for about 45 minutes straight.  Clerics, Wizards, Druids suddenly start running around, efficiency is lost.<P>This would be a good way to add depth to bards and the game in general.

</FONT><HR>and another thing...<P>"&gt;&gt;&gt;Why am I still holding a flute when playing a drum?<P>Evidently the drum animations aren't in, or perhaps we don't have anything that looks like a drum when held. I've not personally looked at the appearence in game to see."<BR>Abashi<BR>Station Member <P>Abashi, how in the world can you make a statemnet like this?  This sure looks like your lying, because this topic has been posted since you appeared on the bored, and well before that.  YOU have posted numerous responses explaining that the file is too big to do as a patch...  Why it was not included in the release of a major upgrade... I can only speculate.  It would have to be a discusion on priorities.  Notice how barbarian males were missing sheild graphics... the sheild is in the game... why no drums after a year and a half?<P>Really, the drums don't matter... it's your pathetic response Abashi!  It either shows your level of incompetence or your level of ignorance relative to bards.  But, hey...<P>"&gt;&gt;&gt;There have been several instances where one of the developers states there is a problem, and then you come along and say it is working as intended. Now I'm not trying to flame, but, as I see it, you are over-riding the programmers and developers. Are you the main person who decides the all of the issues in EQ? <P>I think that there is little understanding on the level of communications that goes on behind the scenes. Depending on the issue, I may or may not bring other people into the decision process. I was hired due to my understanding of the big picture, being tuned in to what the design team was trying to accomplish. In many cases, I often have a better idea of this than anyone on a large scale, besides of course the producers and lead designers. That is why I make decisions in regard to what issues, for instance, that I'll bring to a tuning meeting for discussion."<P>this makes me feel... ummm, under-serviced and ignored.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Abashi,<BR>     2 Things a really apparent in this statement that you made:<P>"I was unable to reproduce the claim that lullaby works better on level 1 npcs at level 15, than at level 60. In fact, I noticed a substantial decrease in primary resists, though secondaries remained constant, as they should."<P>First off, you call that a test? You spend 30 seconds trying to reproduce an issue and decide that everything is ok? What a joke, and what poor customer service. There isn't an ounce of fact or proof in that statement.<P>Secondly, you are very, very good. I especially like the line "lullaby [does not]work better on level 1 npcs at level 15, than at level 60." Wow, talk about skirting the issue. ALL YOU HAVE PROVEN THERE IS THE SONG IS BROKEN AT LVL 15 JUST AS MUCH AS IT IS BROKEN AT LVL 60. Wow, your smooth, that was great.<P>Bards are upset, but you could care less. It's eveident in the amount of time you have researched this issue. During a phone call? Nice test. Every Bard in here knows this song is useless, no matter what lvl you are. You wanna quiet some people down? Here's how<P>A.) TELL US WHAT THE RESIST RATE SHOULD BE FOR A LVL 30 BARD WHEN HE TRIES TO LULLABY MOBS UNDER LVL 30. <P>B.) PROVE IT. Let me see your log showing that a lvl 1 snake was lullaby'd X% of the time and had only X% resists. <P>At that point you will actually have some proof and not this "I tested it on the phone" garbage. PROOF. Then maybe we can get something done.<P>I must say VI's handling of this is poor IMO. You have a chance to make the game a little better without imbalancing anyone, yet you choose the easiest, laziest way out. <P>PROOF<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 10 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011801-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011801.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011801-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011801-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011801-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011801-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011801-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011801-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011801-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011801-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=011801&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=011801&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
