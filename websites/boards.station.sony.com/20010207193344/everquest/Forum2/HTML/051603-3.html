</FONT><HR>"Yes. I plan to do that with all of my lists, probably in the class specific boards to make them easier to find."<P>hmmmm...would rather they be here just like the "talk" threads thmeselves, for the same reason you gave about them (gives EVERYBODY, not just those who play each class, the opportunity to dicuss them).<P>"And, as I said, I did not start threads called 'necromancer talk' or 'magician talk'. I have,   however, been involved in very intense threads about these classes, and I feel I have enough information on them to build a good list."<P>Problem I have is that, whereas all the other classes will have one thread which contains the substance from which your lists are culled from, these two classes are left without a similar resource. Speaking for myself, I find it hard to believe that you could have a real idea about ALL the "class balance" issues concerning magicians (yup, thats what I play) based upon what has been discussed in the various magician threads that have occurred since you began working at Verant. You may have some ideas about a FEW of the issues, but hardly to the extent that the "talk" threads have generated for their classes. Unfair, Absor, truely unfair.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>i think this is a wonderful idea absor, hope it doesnt get abused and turned into a 20page thread, with most people whining about class balance not ever being done. if you all read this peoples... then give your "specific" ideas and suggestions for improvement on your classes, dont make this an anti-verant forum or it will go away.<P>my suggestion is for necros. first i'd like a moment of silence for the largest necro guild on quellious server "lords of the undead". they are no more, due to the fact a large portion of the 50+ necros are quitting the game (that should say something).<P>now, on with my necro specific class balancing. <BR>1) its darn near impossible for necros to get in groups because without our fear spell and pet (both taboo in most dungeons or major raid zones) we are pretty useless, except for mana and summon corpse (which all the uber shadow knights are now after, and one more step in making necro's obsolete... at least the SK can melee, has most of our dots and spells, now has summon corpse and has harm touch). even with our mana transfer capability, we can give 1/3 of our mana to a cleric, which results in about 2, maybe 3 complete heals at most, and since our lifetap spell is generally gonna be resisted at higher levels, that mana we are giving them may need to be recycled on us. its far from efficient enough to make us worth while on a raid or in groups...<P>2) at level 46, i had 2 mobs both level 24 solo me and my pet, see through feign death, and resist half my spells while not being taunted off by me pet, and interrupting the other half... these were just a pair of guards in mistmoore, not even past the graveyard... either we necros have been nerfed to all heck and you want us this way, or something needs to be done about mobs 20 levels lower than me, even in a pair or in group of 3, killing me and my pet (even my lowest 44pet would con blood red for 10 levels to these mobs). what gives? and seeing through feing death??? at 20 levels lower???<P>3) i saw everything when a group camping the chief in east wastes took a ranger and paladin over 2 necros...<P>4)our epic weapon is useless other than stats, or fighting green mobs, even if we get it between 50 and 55. mana free snare/dot spell is useless if all mobs we fight 50+ are essentially magic proof.<BR>and having to raid chardok, innoruuk, cazic thule and a quest up to the 5th island in sky, plus killing 3, 55+ mobs in a spawn point, 2 of which are magic proof?? who thought of the duck head look??? give necro a green aura surrounding their hand, and give it a summon essence emerald... much more useful... cool looks and functional... maybe then more necros wouldnt mock me trying to get it.<P>5) why arent other casters resisted half as much on uber mobs (dragons, etc...) at least make it so specializing allows spells in that category to still land after we reach like a 250 or higher skill. if i specialize in alteration, my lifetap and vamp curse spells would still land (note, dots arent alteration, so we wouldnt have to address the issue of "mana efficiency" and "overpoweredness of necros". especially since my main job is mana battery, a couple of lifetaps or bond of death, and i am not dying while regenning mana for clerics, plus doing a little damage, maybe 1000 to 1200 total over the fight (as opposed to wizzies landing that much in one cast). it all should depend on specialization...<P>6)since many mobs are magic proof, where are the melee proof mobs? that to me is the ultimate imbalance. if you cant make melee proof mobs, or make my spells take on magic proof... at least give me a superior heal for my pet (disable it in duel or pvp, since you cant heal pet in duel anyways) but make it a medium to high mana cost, so i can sit and regen mana while pet fights, then cast complete heal once or twice in fight... i could then solo some of these magic proof mobs (take tundra jack) without actually casting a spell on him... you could even make a pet complete heal cost an essence emerald or something... (since you probably arent gonna give us a summon essence emerald spell or epic wep).<P>7) new spell ideas:<BR>    a. group dead man floating<BR>    b. teleport to undead ruins (self only even)<BR>    c. improved feign death<BR>    d. ** give enchanters an "enchant emerald"<BR>       spell, 50+ with high mana cost, that would <BR>       create an essence emerald, maybe require a <BR>       component other than emerald to combine <BR>       with, like maid or butler fangs, to make <BR>       questable...<BR>    e. improved shadowstep (controlled, will <BR>       shadowstep you range 200 in direction you <BR>       are facing, or to whatever/whoever you have<BR>       targeted, within range of 200<BR>    f. if we cant get self teleports, then maybe <BR>       have a wormhole spell, with dual bind <BR>       points, so we can gate back and forth <BR>       between 2 points, instead of gate one way<BR>       and get TP or run back... especially useful<BR>       considering the KOSness of necros based on<BR>       class and deity alone (even if its a higher<BR>       level spell, say 39 or 44, just to make <BR>       lower necros deal with the essence of the <BR>       class some, before getting a benefit)<BR>    g. group feign death (for those that thing it<BR>       would suck, simply give an onscreen option<BR>       to have it effect them, or a on/off in <BR>       options menu... this would have saved a my<BR>       group 3 times last night at orc fort trying<BR>       to break into chief room....<BR>    h. area of effect fear... a must have!!<BR>    i. resist fear (nice group buff, would stack <BR>       with resist magic, so it adds a specific <BR>       resist to fear or AoE fear of dragons, etc.<BR>    j. most of our buffs are self only... how <BR>       about making them any target, even if it <BR>       still requires a reagent such as steelskin<BR>       does, or like make arch-shielding type <BR>       spells cast on others... im sure tanks <BR>       would love it... make us group friendly =)<P>anyways, these are just my humble suggestions for necro improvement (mostly group friendly, which is what we need to be and a couple in the spirit of necro, which is the ultimate solo'er...)<P>to all those who may flame... these are simply minor improvements, that would help you significantly in group, and not overpower necros by any means... just make us more fun to play, maybe take some money from druids and wizzies that make a killing on teleporting us... heck, it would be replaced with enchanters making a killing on essence emeralds...<P>Xelera Mistmoore &lt;Royal Serenity&gt; of Quellious<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I, as a paying customer, demand "'PvP' thread talk". And then "'Nonsense' thread talk" (pretty well balanced in my opinion) and possibly by then we'd need "'Thread talk' thread talk (Part two) - By Absor".<P>We need to maintain balance on the message boards (since they're more fun than the game anyway).

</FONT><HR>Absor, I mean not to flame, rant or personally attack. I really appreciate the class threads  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">; and most of the suggestions REALLY make sense. I think what it boils down to is that Verant really messed up on some of the classes at level 51+.<P>What does bother me is your attitude is that you and you only decides what ideas are good. hehe who the hell died and made you a god? I think it would be better to simply collect the issues like you have been and let the players vote on the issues whenever they log in that particular class.<P>Yes its impossible to please all people all the time. Lets say you gave the top 10 issues with every class and let players vote for 3 changes to be made, and change 5 issues most voted for. Wouldn't this be the most logical and effective way to handle the situation?? <P>I can say I am at least familiar with half the classes in these threads and what I do read really doesn't lean on 'Give us more power', what they lean on is 'Fix our class'. Aren't the players just asking for changes to make their class more playable and enjoyable, particularly at the higher levels? Isn't that Verant's goal too? Please, Please let the players vote on the changes, Dammet lets have a democracy  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The only thing that bothers me about this whole approach is when Absor says (semiquote) 'When I give my opinion on these things remember I'm only one guy and I'm just taking these to the whole group to decide.'   The problem?  He's only one guy and not supposed to be making any decisions on what is good or bad, yet he in many cases says flat out, 'I don't think that class should get that change/improvement so I won't take it to the group.'  What if Absor is the only one who thinks that?  Then a good idea is being squashed before the real 'voters' get a chance to even see it.  In my opinion, all of the 'common' requests should see the light of day by the committee.  If its a no-brainer that they don't want a class to have something it takes 1 minute to shelve it at that point but at least the people who are supposed to be looking at these issues see the issues.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sigh...Rangers are considered such a sub species with the most problems in the game.  In which we are soo worthless in post lvl 50 area of Everquest that instead of Addressing Ranger issues first they address our issues LAST!  While all the other classes, especially one's who have zip for problems in post 50 levels get talked about first.<P>In the end it means what it has always meant.  Ranger problems will get addressed last or not at all.  This just confirms that rangers won't see any changes and nothing we say will be addressed or basicially ignored or postponed for a infinite amount of time.  While all the other classes have their discussions and fixes made before Ranger problems are even addressed.<P>Well Absor, if you wanted to insult the one class that has alot of problems in post 50 levels.  By prioritizing our problems being last on the list, Congradulations.  All the waiting we have had to suffer thru for any hope of changes get delayed again to being last on the list.  <P>I wonder now if the ranger class problems will ever be addressed for post 50 levels at this rate.  More delay tactics by Absor and the rest of Verant against rangers.<P>Ixcor Blackthorne<BR>Lvl 53 Pathfinder<P>Ixcorian D'eltaire<BR>Lvl 51 Vicar<P>Ixcutus<BR>Lvl 18 Wizard<P>Forgotten Alliance Guild<BR>Bertox Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan<P>Waiting on the PvP "talk" thread.  Just my opinion, and that of everyone else on Vallon Zek, but PvP needs to be addressed in conjunction with class balance.  If pvp is left out of the loop then the classes WILL NOT be balanced.<P>Morvran, Vallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello,<P>Absor, I made a post on the Mage summoning thread first page after about 45 mins of searching, unsuccessfully I may add, the thread list for the "Mage talk" thread. I waited for the official talk thread, but after a couple of days figured that that must be it. If you could direct us to the intended Mage balance thread, I'd like to repost my ideas. (I have since thought up a couple more) Thanx  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Jiffy Creamystyle (Hansii)<BR>Mage of the Seventh Circle<BR>Army of Norrath<BR>Tribunal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well this will probably not get read by anyone at Verant being so far down the list but what the heck.<P>First I must say I see progress since I came back. Too try and start on a good note I am quite pleased to find that the xp penalty has finaly been removed I feel like the break has been taken off my xp bar. I've made 5 levels in the time it previously took to get one. I also like the incrimental xp bar it may not be a real difference but it's good for the moral to actually see progress. I can now look at each orange bub like I previously looked at an entire level.<P>I quit playing 6months ago because I got tired of taking a week to get each new level and running around for hours looking for a group since I risk my life soloing a high green. My primary is a Ranger I started it because it seemed like a cool concept. At the time I didn't know about the xp penalty and didn't know that a bow was pretty much useless. I looked at all the skills,(all I had at the time was the Official*ly useless* strategy guide and thought Duel weild cool, I didn't realize that all the other classes who got it got it at a lower level than us. I noticed the restriction on armors but thought hey that's ok I'm agile and will avoid hits. I didn't realize that Warriors got better armour and better defensive skills. <P>At any rate the point is from my experience and the experience of others who I have listened to and talked with Rangers need help. I know that other classes especially hybrids have problems as well but not having played them I can not speak authoritatively about them. and I will leave that to people who actually play those classes and are familiar with their problems.<P>I do find it disapointing that the order you have chosen to address the classes seems to put those needing the least work first and those needing the most last. I do commend you for at least taking up these issues.<P>On Rangers I wish Brad would pick a different class to play. It seems like Verant is afraid to do anything good for Rangers out of fear for favoritism concerns. And as such we get screwed. Our class has been stealth nerfed slowly over the last couple of years. Mainly through other classes getting buffed while we were ignored. Our signiture skill tracking has been given to other classes (including bards which I can't fathom how a tavern lounging city loving gleeman would ever gain any knowledge of woodlore.) I could understand if it were rogues there really should be an evil class capable of tracking but bards make no sense, Still it is anoying that our class defining skill has been shared so widely. Paly's and SK have legitimant beafs but at least they don't have to say that their defining abilities are shared with other classes. <P>Rangers have nothing to make them unique or desirable in a group. anything we can do someone else can do better. Including tracking. Sure we have a higher cap but until the skill is fixed Druids and Bards are actually better trackers than we are. Our spells are too low level to be useful by the time we get them. Any group would prefer to have a pure class over us. We can't heal enough to make even a decent 3rd string healer. We can't nuke enough to justify stopping swinging our weapons. We don't hit hard enough to keep up with a warrior and we're mana sinks since we agro like crazy have pathetic AC and low hit points. <P>I don't have all the answers to the balance question but I do have some idea's first would be to make clear that balance issues are not all post 50. In fact I would say that most balance issues post 50 are caused becasue of imbalance pre 50. <P>Here's something you never hear. <BR>"/shout group looking for members Ranger prefered."<P>In fact I have hell finding groups unless someone actually knows me I usually end up having to start my own groups. Which is particularly anoying since I can't solo worth squat in fact if I could solo halfway effectively I prolly wouldn't have much to complain about. Then again if I could solo effectively as a ranger I would probably have an easier time finding groups. <P>As it is now a Ranger is nothing more than a watered down warrior with a few marginally useful spells, I say marginally since most likely when we're in a group there is almost always someone (druid,cleric,shamman) with better. Oh we do get snare, our one really useful spell which saves the druids mana for heals and prevents trains. But other than that most of our spells are pretty much useless I had a druid laughing at me last night when I finally got my 30th level spells because he had them all at like 9th level. Now I can understand that most of our spells should be lower level than pure casters but so much lower? I mean take Sow for instance we get it at 39th that's a 14th level druid spell hell its a 9th level Shaman spell. (by the way everyone says rangers are part druid part warrior I would say based upon the spells we get we are more like part druid part shamman part warrior) We're talking 25 to 30 levels lower. And if we're supposed to be more caster post 50 then that seems excessive. <P>Oh well I guess I'll just start my own thread until the official one comes out maybe that will give all us rangers a head start coming up with good ideas to hit you with when the official thread starts.<P>Skex Relbore <BR>30th Season Ranger <BR>Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
