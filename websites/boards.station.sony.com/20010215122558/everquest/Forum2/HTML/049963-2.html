I am very happy with the class, and I enjoy everquest alot.<P>   That being said, however... there are some shortcomings of the monk class.  <P>   As brother ashek has stated, we really don't do much more damage than a well equiped warrior any longer (provided we are both hasted to nullify the Celestial Fists advantage).<P>   In addition, FD as agro mitigation seems to have become less effective in SoV than it ever was before in the ways that ashek mentioned.<P>   We can't even muster the same AC as a well equipped level 60 rogue as far as I can tell, and people say that rogues make cruddy tanks?<P>   Other than friendship, and player skill, what reason does a group have to choose a monk rather than a warrior or rogue?  Granted, there are still places to use the 'fd pull' strategy, but often times this is not required or desired.<P>   This is the umpteenth thread asking for monk issues to be addressed, please respond absor (or anyone for that matter).<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm sorry, i just don't see it...   My monk does (on average at level 30) 4 hits for 15 (22 max) and a leap attack that does (so far) up to 58 points of damage...

Yes, some of the warriors I've grouped with have done up to 85 points of damage (170 total vs 118) but still ...<P>Monks are easily one of the best solo tanks in the game...   And if they were more powerful before the kunark expansion, I see why Verant nerfed them ...  (Maybe human monks are a bit different, since Iksars get regeneration and natural AC, but please ...)<P>I completely agree the FD needs to work better, and more damage would be nice, but like I said, I just don't see it...  (I want to hit more, and faster - couldn't care less about aggro - make it easier for the clerics to heal one that it is to heal 3 different tanks ...)  --  I'd also like to see less damage per hit (i'm tired of being hit for 70 points of damage ...) but again, I don't think monks are as bad off as Ashek is making it sound like ...  They do need some tweaking, but it's just not that bad (this is like throwing a tempor tantrum cuz the kid across the street just got a new bike ....)  --  If you think Monks aren't as good as Rogues, then go play a rogue ...<P>I've played all the tanks / hybrids (actually with the exception of the bard and the rogue), and I think the monks are the best in the game...  I would like less damage per hit, and (whine if you want), would like to see faster attacks (which would get you more damage), but I'm quite happy with a monk, and will continue to play him ...<P>Draggyn Slayyer<BR>30th Iksar Monk<BR>Cazic-Thule / Children of Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Draggyn, when your monk gets to his mid 50's then come back and talk.  Monks do own pre 50 and nobody is arguing that.  In the mid 50s you definitely start to see a serious decline in power.  At that point the warriors and rogues are starting to catch up in their attack ratings and they certainly have better ac.  At 60 a monk is his weakest and has damage output comparable to a warrior with far less ac or hp.  Yet, the monk is supposed to be able to tank halfway decently.  Pre 50 you get hit less than wars and rogues but that advantage goes away too thanks to their improvements in parry and dodge.<P>Sorry but you'd be a fool to pick a monk over a warrior or rogue for post 50 gameplay.  It's simple math and not really disuputable.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>/agree with ashek.<P>All other melee/hybrid classes seem to fall into one of two categories: damage taker (war, pal, sk) or damage avoider (rog, rng).  I know that jolt doesnt work against uber mobs but i think that its existance puts them in the second category.  We however, fall into neither, with the damage absorbtion abilities of a rogue but no way to lower our place on hate lists at all in some cases or, more commonly, without losing several attack rounds.<P>As I see it the two main abilities that are extremely usefull pre 50, FD and mend, are most likely going to cripple our chances for balance post 50.  I rarely use fd when pulling now because either a bard is pulling with his calm song or someone who is a higher level is a quicker, more effective puller.  This ability is so zone/situation specific post 50 that it should not be a major factor when looking at our balance issues.  As for mend, im sorry this is not the same as having extra hps. It doesnt make CH any more efficient and once its gone you dont get the extra time for smaller heals to land that extra hps would give. <P>Ah almost forgot another official excuse i remember: undiscovered weapons.  A weapon that 95% of lvl 55+ monks will never get will not make a class balanced in damage.  At this point in the game only the addition of skills, changes in skill caps, or changing already existing weapons will have any significant effect.<P>Id also like to bump the idea that the ability to fight naked is completely worthless.  I rarely have to travel to my body anymore, and if i do, i dont go alone.  The most use ive found for this skill in the past 20 levels is killing the halfling guards in RV while waiting for a res.<P>/bump the damage vs war/rog posts<P>In case you missed the point of my post: dont bother to make an official response that only holds true pre 50. In the same vein, dont look at the common perception of our abilities (FD rules!, I wish i could mend, its great!), look at the impact they actually have and how this compares to another classes abilities (ie paladins get lay hands, imo 100% more useful than mend in a group AND still get more hps). <P><BR>Khelar<BR>Iksar Master<BR>Erollisi Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>IMO the 9/16 on CFs is just not fitting for a monk that does nothing but uber mobs. I have to sit back and take it up the rear because my attacks are tiny but fast. And yes I die all the time thanks to the ignorance of the new Velious mobs that don't know when to stop attacking after a monk FDs. Make the CFs 17/24 or something to that effect so that we can do the damage that we deserve to do and yet not taunt as much as we are right now. Rogue evade still works, only makes sense that FD should still work on these encounters as well.<P>Denzalo 60th monk of Afterlife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Pre-Kunark monks had a significant advantage in blocking/dodging, which has to be right for martial arts specialists.<P>This has vanished due to programming limitations.<P>I'd like to see this particular advantage restored.  I don't think extra hp and ac fits in with the 'vision', but I would like to see the mob I'm fighting to be swinging and missing a lot more than currently happens in life post 50.<P>For the sake of balance they could make any increased blocking/new block skill only work if you are facing the mob (so it wouldn't help during pulls) and maybe even work on the currently selected target only /shrug.<P>Monks are all about (or at least used to be) skills and abilities.  I think this is the way forward when talking about pure melee balance.<P>On a side note I think the monk best of the best should be fought naked except for a newbie monk guild tunic, and all skills available.  It's not like we have backstab or stuns following a sucessful ID.<P>I'd also like to see new tailored items/interesting old world quests, that result in some sort of cured silk with magic resist, say same AC and weight as cured, and +5 to a resist of the tailor's choice.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

You all have made great points on those topics so my 2 copper is not needed 8)<P>Another issue I would like to address is the weight of most monk useable items.  Why does VI make darn sure we have to either ride that extremely low weight limit line very closely to gain a high AC or be a crappy secondary tank and wear shivercrap to stay under cap.  I mean, the best monk useable items seem to be way too heavy.  All of us are not in UBER guilds so we won't be able to get all the best stuff to stay under limit and be a somewhat effective secondary tank.  (Why did I get started on this topic?)  <P>Hear is the one item that really burns me up.  The "TRANQUIL STAFF".  Can any of my monk brothers and sisters tell me why in the hell does our without a doubt best weapon weigh 10.0 stones/pounds?  All the parsers show that CF's only have a marginal increase of damage over this weapon.  The proc is absolutely UBER.  I can't for the life of me figure this one out.  The bottom line is the Tstaff should only be about 5.0 stones max.  I would really like to see it at 3.0 stones but we know that is a dream.<P>Bah before I really get into a rant will sign off.<P>Thanks for listening,<P>Yoshimura Mohashimu<BR>57 Master, Innoruuk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am relatively new to the game, having only played for a couplr months. I am still trying out various race class combos to see which I really like, and want to commit to in advancing to level 60. Because of my real life experience in training with shaolin monks, I wanted to try out the monk character first.<P>Traditional monks are priests, plain and simple. Not only were they extremely proficient in unarmed combat, they were also skilled in weapons, and various techniques in penetrating armor, and shields. Although combat situations were avoided, they were also well versed in fighting strategy, and dealing with multiple opponents. To extend this to a fantasy environment, I would suggest some of these ideas to be considered:<P>1. Monks are priests, and should receive some spell like abilities, if not actual spells simialr to a paladin. Minor healing spells, calming spells, shield like spells, maybe personal combat hastes, food and water summoning, etc. I realize this would seriously upset the current balance and would probabally not be implemented, but when you look at the role of the traditional monk in history, and fantasy, you have to at least agree that they were priests, and should be given some of their powers.<P>2. Monks spend a considerable amount of time in meditation and should be granted an ability to simulate this. I would use meditation to increase HP regeneration, possibly as a method to obtain a low level saving throw versus any negative conditions they may have on them at the time. Also it could be used as a means to focus the mind in order to have a higher chance of success for a short while in trade skills, or other non combat situations. Perhaps a "tranquil" monk could pass by mobs that would normally attack them. Ie a tranquil iksar monk might be able to pass by guards in other cities that would normally consider them KOS.<P>3. Monks are capable of complex battle tactics and dealing with multiple opponents. Various techniques are used such as leading one opponents attack to hit another opponent, sweeping attacks, double kicks and strikes designed to hit opponents in opposite directions, etc. This is an area that is not really respresented and should be addresed. Dealing with multiple attackers is never as effective as dealing with a single one, so any area damage attacks would of course do lower damage. Also, there is a lack of stunning and knockback effects: monk attacks are precise, and usually have some kind of secondary effect. Strikes to the solar plexus, groin, throat, etc should at least stun the opponent or produce a small debuff (ie reduced mob effectiveness cause they just got a boot to the can, difficulty breathing because of getting a fighting baton in the solar plexus, etc.). While on the topic of combat effectiveness, the soft stlye of the art seems to be completely ignored, alhough it is the most effective style at high levels of mastery. Throws, pressure points, should all be utilized.<P>I would also like to see more martial artsy type items which enhance the hand to hand skill. Handwraps of differing materials (patchwork, studded, reinforced?) More variety in lightweight armor (although I recognize traditionally monks wore no armor), or a better natural AC. <P>I've babbled enough about this. In closing, I would like to suggest the following:<P>1. Monks get more special attacks which also produce some kind of special effect: stun, area attacks, chance to deal "critical blows".<P>2. Implement spell like abilities called meditations. Offensive meditation would the mind and body before combat allowing various personal buffs for a short time. Defensive meditations would increase HP regeneration, and grant mental focus (Int and Wis Buff?) allowing for greater success in non combat skill attempts. All meditations would have a high "casting" time, so would not really be useable in a meelee situation.<P>3. The ability to go tranquil, which would replace sneak (maybe just for the human monks since iksar aren't exactly tranquil) in the ability to go somewhere without being attacked by mobs that might normally attack you. <P>4. Allow more tailor made / smith made items useable only by a monk. Handwraps, martial arts weapons that use the hand to hand skill, better selection of armors, etc.<P>5. Monks were fairly self sufficient, and should be able to forage their own supplies. They sould never be as good as a ranger or druid in this regard, maybe give humans a cap of 50 so they can be in line with their iksar brothers.<P>Thank you for reading this post. Please consider some of these ideas.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Great Post.<P>Rogues have ben thrown so many bones in the expansion packs it is downright silly. <P>If you have never grouped wtih a high lvl rogue and left other hits on for awhile then you really do not have any valid comments as to damage comparrison. Ashlek is not exaggerating when he states they can do 2X the damage of a monk while maintaining less aggro due to their evade skill. Double backstab is the bomb.<P>In fact I have grouped with lvl 60 rogues who assasinate approximately 13% of their mobs in a single swing and this is no exaggeration. Their AC is now superior to ours, hide/sneak absolutely rules and they even have poison to fiddle with should they want to.<P>As for Warriors, they can now "do it all". In addition to what ashlek said a warrior has weapon and armour rpcos that others can only dream about. Snare, slows, invisi, shrink etc. My god is there anything they have not given the warrior since level 50?? As for damage lets toss them triple attack as an innate skill and increase their caps considerably.<P>Monks have been shafter period. High lvl dungeon pulling is no longer the role of the monk and is deferred to the highest lvl person in the group. Clerics are now often splitting mobs ahead of the monk. SK's at 60 have a rocking FD spell that recycles much faster than the monk's.<P>We have been shafted so much so that in our guild 2 of our other high lvl monks started up warriors since expansion. I know this is not an isolated case either. We outnumber rogues to monks in our guild as well. I've started a rogue who sits at 44 now becasue he along with the warrior is the teachers pet and VI is no longer interested in the monk class.<P>Personally I felt that VI focussed so much on making the Iksar monk and Shaman that they neglected them in almsot all other regards to class enhancement.<P><BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My primary is a lvl 34 monk and what I am hearing is distressing.<P>FD failing to work at all in battle at high levels? This one scares me alot.<P>And now for a few things in the pre 50 range.<P>I understand the weight limit and have dealt with it fine but it's becoming harder to cope when you are hunting in say Frontier Mountains and you take down a hillock with Hammer of flattening. Boom you are overweight. If we are alone do we leave it or just stop hunting and make the 20 minute run back to FV to sell it. Personally at 34 I am not rich I need the plat. The obvious answer is a weight reducing back. The best ones are ridiculously expensive. I would make best friends with mages for their bags if not for the very real possiblity (especially lately) of getting dropped from the game. I could use a mage bag for looted weapons but I lose plat if dropped or I could put bandages/food in one but if I get drooped I am forced to make that run back to FV to restock<P>Weapons? Bah! I still don't think that was a wise move and was a complete turnaround from the original vision. And to make us give up AC to wield the best ones is absurd. I am not an expert on high level weapons but how many other classes pay an AC penalty to wield their high end weapons<P>Just a few thoughts from a mid 30's monk who loves his class but is getting worried that we may be in the same class as bards in that we are such a unique class that Verant has programmed themselves into a corner making fixes for these classes harder to come by.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am new to this whole EQ bit, post kunark monk, started on wiz, got to 13, started my monk, now almost 27.<P>OK, as a monk, I find that around 27 my main utility comes from pulling, not tanking.<P>From my own experience, I am often outdone damage wise, and yet still take a good load of the hits.  <P>As far as FD goes, the majoraty of the time it works.  At the moment I am in Ill Omen, and often shake red drachnids on my way to FV.<P>IMPROVEMENTS I'D LIKE TO SEE:<P>A) More attacks. We should be able, as levels progress, to fire off more than one special assault.  This would up the damage output, and wouldn't even have to be too unreasonable, say, 1 special lvls 1-12, 2 attcks 13-24, etc...<BR>Kick doesn't do too much damage, but having a few kicks per mob would come in handy.<P>B) More weapon options.  More specifically, fist enhancers, ones that up your damage, or weaken you, but up your speed, a set of glove quests, like the headbands or sashes.<P>C) Defense.  Since my flurry of attacks attracts aggro, I think a higher AC bonus for the weight limit would rule, going overweigt for me at this point will still yield higher AC/HP values.<P>D) Nifty Factor.  This is more for all classes than just monks ( though I feel monks would be most enhanced by this).  The dicseplines are a good start, something very class specific, and also relates to "real life", as the Shaolian fellow said earlier, enhancing monks with more realistic type abilities, perhaps changing a few of the animations at later levels, just stuff to keep the char fresh.<P>one last little thought, from what Ive heard, pre-kunark monks were the shimmy, they were wanted, needed, and there were a ton of them (I might be off the mark here), is it possible Verant released these two monk-weak expansions to thin the population out?  If I were starting a new char, fresh-out the box, and had read all of this, I would be more likely to pick a rouge or a warrior as my 2nd, as opposed to my monk.  Perhaps the next expansion will be another human continent, and will have nice monk type stuff, items that proc round-kick. Asking for a patch, imo, won't do too much good, but asking for more stuff in an expansion might do some good.  From how it sounds, that's what happened, aside from FD, rouges and warriors got stronger, and the monk gained precious little.  Wait a few months.  As far as I can tell, that's all we really can do.<P>Aeor Aborialis, 26 monk, Erolissi Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I love people that go to caster's realm or somewhere and do a most damageing weapon search and see that shuriken up there and think we rock because of it.  In case you didnt know, it is a shuriken that rarely drops off the mummy's in hate.  I've pulled hate dozens of times and I got a total of 1 shuriken.  When I used it, guess what? It missed. HA.  As for the others, well good luck, ton po has never been confirmed to drop on a live server, Torsmag drops in VP.  99% of all monks will never see either.  RFS and IFS a monk might get if he has a ton of cash or in an uber guild, or gets really lucky.  Usually only half a dozen of each per server.  Don't attempt to call us balanced because 12-15 monks per sever have the best weapons.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Tsear, Iskar Swiftail of the Rathe here.<BR>I do agree with some points. We should have our dodge etc skill caps upped abit per level, we should be able to avoid an attack alot better than some warrior in heavy armor. An improved version of FD is needed for higher levels. <P>That and one other thing, I am also one who likes to use his fists as well, as we were meant to. However pre 50 its not really worth it as there are many better weapons. I made a new H2H Chart, with afew changes to make h2h decent, so it would be worth fighting with your fists all the way up to 60 if you wish.<P>Lev Dam Del <BR>1   6 34<BR>5   7 33 <BR>10  8 32<BR>15  9 31<BR>20 10 30 <BR>25 11 30 <BR>30 12 30 <BR>35 13 30 <BR>40 14 30 <BR>45 14 29 <BR>50 14 28 <BR>55 14 27 <BR>60 15 26<P>Through the levels there are better weapons available, yet the fists are decent enough to have that option to use them while still fighting decently. The old fist chart just doesnt cut it till about 50, so we are practicing h2h for 35-40 levels and the whole time untill then our fists are stinkin. Maybe there need to be a few digit changes, but basically we need more power to our punch on our way to the higher levels when we can truly appreciate them. Alright thanks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>**shrug**<P>Whyd you say 5 reasons but mention 7 weapons =\<P>Anyways, monks can outdamage warriors unless the warrior gets a few nice crits in there, but the gap isnt that large, and sometimes the warrior will outdamage the monk.  Rogues outdamage monks and warriors, but besides BS and a few locked doors they are worthless.  <P>Anyways, the only things I can see being done for monks are:<P>1. FD-Lets face it, were never going to get our old fd back.  Where we could pull level 50 mobs, fd, and they wouldnt think twice.  I do think this should be about the same effectiveness as rogues Evade though, always make it lower your aggro, but never clear it on stuff past 32 or whatever that level is where it all changes.  <P>2. Crits, give them to monks.  This will increase the damage gap between them and warriors, and lower the gap a bit with them and rogues.  And, honestly warriors cant complain for monks getting crits on regular attacks.  No one will ever be able to tank like a warrior, and they will always be needed anyway.  <P>3. Triple attack.  Give monks this and/or crits.  Give them it at 60 like warriors, its not a huge advancement, but it helps out.  <P>4. Up the AC on monk SoV and even RoK items, its a little on the low side...<P>5. Improve the fists a little.  Once you get a pair of trance sticks, which is easily possible around 40 with a half decent group and some time, no one will ever use fists again, untill they get Celestial fists, and not every level 60 is going to have celestial fists...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
