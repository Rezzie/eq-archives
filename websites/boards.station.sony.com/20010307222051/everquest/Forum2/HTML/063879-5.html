</FONT><HR>I am one of the more outspoken against the requirement to have a Cleric all the time at high levels (see my thread suggesting rez should be readily available to other classes here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063133.html)<P>But I just have to say, my god, what a stupid pointless nerf!<P>Abashi wrote:<P>&gt; The casting time WAS 20 seconds. the spell effect lasts 24 seconds. This means the primary<BR>&gt; tank could have a CONSTANT flow of 300 HP every 6 seconds for the ENTIRE durration of the fight.<BR>&gt; This means of a MOB Can not do more than 300 damage to the Warrior every 6 seconds he can<BR>&gt; never win. Also because Celestial Elixer is an over time effect you could skip one application<BR>&gt; of it and use Complete Heal instead, then start over having only lost 1.6 pulses of<BR>&gt; Celestial Elixer.<P>Um, with standard meditation rates at 51+, to get back the 400 mana required for a complete heal (before specialization) takes 13.33 ticks.  So if the warrior has 5K HP, then against any MOB that does less than 300HP/tick damage, the Cleric can just med up for a complete heal every time the warrior gets low, indefinately.<P>So the breastplate added what?<P>Giving the effect a 1 minute cast time makes it completely useless.  With Clarity, the Cleric can med up the mana to cast Celestial Elixir in less than a minute, without the penalty of not being able to heal anyone else for a full minute.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Uh, gentlemen, Verant --<P>May I suggest the following changes instead to the CH and Celestial Elixir BPs?<P>If at all possible --- at all possible please --- have them NOT cast an effect but instead lower the mana cost of casting CH and CE.<P>Right now, CH costs 400, with specialization I think it drops to around 315. With the BP (proposed) a CH will cost say 100 mana. That should fix the "infinite heals" problem.<P>These BPs are one of the high points of a cleric's life (the other is getting the epic.) I for one would be very sad to think there was no reason to hunt for them any more.<P>    Blammar, 53 cleric of Tunare server (though the goddess is mad at me now)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>??<P>If a mob is doing only 300 damage to me in 6 seconds, I don't even need a cleric to heal me, (I am a SK) I can whoop his ass by myself. I can't for the life of me see this item as overpowering. Nice, yes, useful, yes, overpowering, no.<P>Prediction: Verant will reverse themselves on this, at the very least putting a new spell on it, , c'mon, the thing is unusable and an insult to Clerics everywhere in its proposed state.<P>BTW I don't play a cleric. Go back a bit and read the well worded post by Sol someone as how to fix the BP by using a long lasting buff icon.

</FONT><HR>The only answer is for ALL clerics to camp and play alt's till the game grinds to a halt.  I know my cleric mid 50s isn't playing any more.  As for shamans and druids taking over, forget it.  I have a high level shaman and about the 3rd SH we chain cast we move to the top of the agro list and die.  The shaman or druid can't buff the tanks even close to a cleric.  The lower AC and HPs means we need to heal almost nonstop, sorry don't work.  Just my two cents I'm sorry to see the clerics being nerfed out of existence.    </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I feel sorry for everyone that has the breastplate and put in the work to get it, and with 1 minute cast time the effect could just as well have been true north, I mean, it doesn't even take a minute to meditate for a complete heal, so tell me WHY would anyone EVER use the effect after this nerf?

</FONT><HR>I am just angry with the way we have been treated. <P>I posted like 10 times when they nerfed Donal's (using Elsie's account) asking if they had plans to nerf PoG as well.<P>If they had been up front and said yes, fine. <P>But they didn't. They let me believe that the 1500 point heal over 24 seconds with a 20 sec cast time, that doesn't work on liching necro's, anyone poisoned, anyone diseased or anyone under the level 47 was working as intended to elieviate downtime as Absor said the Donal's had failed to do.<P>Just imagine if you were given 3 new spells that you liked and used and then they were all nerfed to barely useable. <P>Then imagine you get a rare Donal's BP and its cast time is nerfed. You are still ok, but then they nerf the recast time to 7 minutes. <P>Then, you hand down your Donal's for PoG, which has already had its cast time nerfed AND is casting the nerfed version of Cel Elix. <P>You are ok with that, but NOW we find out, that* is getting changed to one minute cast time and removed from game and too bad about the work you put in cause we are not making any replacements or exchanges. <P>Oh and then they add, "Hope you like the new agro. If you are dying to much, try and learn tactics from wizzies, k?". <P>And do you realize how much work people put into questing this BP?  Jeez!<P>Add on top of all that, Druids and Shammies have been recently given versions of our new heals.  And Pallies now have rez.<P>How are we suppose to feel?<P>We feel angry and paranoid.  We start thinking this whole thing is to get rid of us.  Like Absor doesn't think people are dying enough.  Maybe the population are progressing in levles to fast.  People getting to many exp rez's?  *shrug*<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Hell, you wouldn't even throw us the smallest bone of giving us the spell Invisibilty.  WHAT WAS SO OVERPOWERING ABOUT CLERICS BEING ABLE TO CAST INVISIBILITY ON THEMSELVES?!?!?!

</FONT><HR>Hi all.  I was out of town this morning, sorry for the lack of response.  Gordon pretty much covered it all, though.<P>I just wanted to stress here that we are not trying upset people, though we knew people would be upset by this change.  We change things like this because we think they need to be changed.<P>Some folks are suggesting (perhaps because I mention that we do some things for the betterment of the game), that we are more concerned with the health of the game than the happiness of our cutomers.<P>I want to point out it that your opinion of what we plan to do is always a consideration, often it is THE consideration.  But sometimes the health of the game is more important.  In the long run, our customers will be happier with a good game.  We need to find and correct our mistakes when they can harm the game.<P>Changing these items is not all that different than any of the 'positive' changes we've made to the game, with the exception of the way those changes have been perceived.  All are done with thought about the health of the game in mind.<P>Alan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I wish i could quad-kite and level 1-50 like nothing as a shaman... the problem is druids have no specialty which makes them less wanted...lets see fair trade off for having so many different things? I think so, even at 50+ i like having a snarer, but wait so can a SK necro ranger and bard...<P>aww the poor druids dug their own hole, stop screwing the clerics to make them happy, and btw take away the new heal over time spells sham and druids are getting i dont NEED It, i NEED A CLERIC!!!!!!!!!<P>WTT cleric for losing all heal over time spells as a sham pls thx<P><BR>ERGOMAS</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR># The problem is when you cast it on the tank when he first enters combat and continue to Chain cast it throughout the fight. Because of the low taunt value of Heal over time spells you will not get aggrod on even for chain casting. The casting time WAS 20 seconds. the spell effect lasts 24 seconds. This means the primary tank could have a<BR>CONSTANT flow of 300 HP every 6 seconds for the ENTIRE durration of the fight. This means of a MOB Can not do more than 300 damage to the<BR>Warrior every 6 seconds he can never win. #<P>Yeah?  SO???????????<P>Name *ONE* Mob that can't do more than 50HP/sec damage to a warrior at 50+ that is so valuable that its demise at the hands of a two-man-group can't be allowed by the Powers That Be.

I always thought that since I had my nice Donals BP that had a free heal and I could heal better than anyone else. But guess what, the donals bp now rarely gets used it doesn't make me poewrful. My heals are hardly better than druids now since CH/group heals have such limited use on high level mobs.<P>You have basically destroyed the *power* a high level cleric could have. I dunno why I level'd past level 51 when I got remedy, that is my uber spell now which is shared by druids and shamans.<P>Ever think of that Absor?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
