</FONT><HR>Scary that people continue to post flames and rude comments in these threads. If you cannot make a logical statement without resorting to name-calling and childish remarks get out. This is hear for reasonable discussion of things that occur in the game.<P>That having been said, I certainly take issue with the changing of these names. From the screenshots on the web page posted by Karn, it is obvious that these names were petitioned out of spite and dislike for Karn and his friends. Someone had a vendetta against them and used the most powerful tool they have... the guides and GMs. And these GMs fell into it hook, line, and sinker. They were just doing their jobs and cannot be blamed for that. They are people just like the rest of us.<P>They were manipulated and used, and if they are aware of this thread and have looked at the screenshots I am sure that they feel a little bad about it.<P>Verant, please, please, please give the guides and GMs a little more discretion when it comes to the naming policy, and please, please, please look into issues where someone petitions a name change out of spite.<P>My 2cp</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What is wrong with Karn?  I've been playing a year and a half and have never seen a named skeleton called Karn.  If there is one I can promise you it didn't exist when I started playing cause I lived in qhills for many months, as a ranger (tracking) and I never saw a Karn.  So they put a new NPC in with a name a player has already chosen and suddenly this player has to change HIS name?  <P>What about the player that had Absor as a player name long before any GM/guide/board moderator had even thought of it?  Now all of a sudden he has to change his name?  <P>You guys are letting verant off the hook too easy.  There's nothing wrong with preecha and Karn as names.  This is trivial, silly, nit pickin stuff.  How can these players play up to lvl 60 and NEVER encounter a GM, guide or other verant rep and not have anything mentioned about it until they kick somebody's arse in pvp on VZ and the loser petitions their name to get back at them.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The naming policy frankly baffles me, i wonder how can Verant decide when a name is not in team with the genre. But who is Verant what a name is in theme or not. I agree that some of the name should be changed when they make no sense or are offensive. But i can see "Grabsmyassalot" as a very appropriate name for an Ogre and i looks definetly in theme. "Jurasic Parke" is another what's wrong with that name other that it fringed on breaking copyrights, why is that name not in theme. Seriously how can you dictate what names are not in theme when there's people in RL named "Pants", "Broken Horseshoes". Back in the 1000-1400 where this theme gets is roots people had way worse name then they do today.<P>My point if the name does is not offensive who cares what it is, does it hurt anyone other then Verant's vision (tm)? A vision that seems to change everyother week when it fits their purpose at the time.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Yes EQ has been part of research for a Psych Thesis, specifically on 20 - 40 year olds and the the relationship deterioration in their lives caused by outside influences. Online games was a big chapter. <P>To get back to topic, I couldnt agree more that the naming policy is unfair or more to the point, implemented unfairly. If its a game and designed for fun, then whats the problem with having any name you want? Sure, get rid of insulting names, but at the end of the day whatever makes it fun for you should stay, as a paying customer.<P>Im sure I could find a reference for a large percentage of all eq names somewhere.

</FONT><HR>I agree. There will always be someone somewhere on the globe that may find a name offensive in some way. An example: the name Pitt. This is the last name of a rather famous American actor. Of course no one with English as their native language will find this name offensive in itself. However, in another language (in this case Swedish) pitt is a rude word for the male genital organ. Thus it may be offensive to someone (this is an example, Im aware that you cant name your character after a living person). Again I must point out that the naming rules are in no way "pretty clear" since they are neither printed in the RoK manual nor mentioned in the character creation process. It's also virtually impossible to know what every NPC in the game is named. Seriously Verant, if someone is named HaiL Hitlah or something I fully agree that the name is may be offensive and perhaps even should be changed, but dont be naming-nazis! The game is supposed to be fun, but forcing players to change names just because you have some naming rules thats virtually impossible to find just makes everyone angry. Btw, I know my grammars aren't always correct but this is not my native language.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is really ridiculous and the responses by Verant are even more ridiculous.  Why is the name "Preecha" in violation of the naming policy?  Is it because it "sounds" like a proper noun?  There are many names that "sound" like other words that may or may not be intended.  For crying out loud.  The whole point here that Verant has yet to address is the fact that their naming policy is vague at best and the discretionary powers given to GMs in changing names needs to be strickly defined and curtailed.  Having a naming policy that's consistant with a world system that is the creation of one or a small group of people and trying to force everyone else to conform to those ideas put forth is exceptionally assinine on the part of Verant given the materials they have published on the world of EQ.  When things like this happen, I wonder if you have anyone who works there with any type of ability to think things through.  It seems that you guys are so paranoid of the parent groups getting up in arms over something that you are willing to react immediately without thinking the consequences through.  Sooner or later, you will have to wake up to the fact that such actions will come back to haunt you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alright, here goes...<P>I've seen names like Alphabet, Noobeedarkee, and, just last night, Woodywoodpecker. These idiots seriously throw me off when I'm playing. It's not just the idiocy that irks me, it's the fact that it's blatant, and designed to grab attention (gee, if your playing skills matched your foolishness, you might be known for something else). <P>I've petitioned all of these names, and they've all been changed. Yeah, I know, I'm such a Nazi :| I don't want to play with someone named Filodex. It's distracting, and I don't find it to be a whole lot of fun.<P>Now to answer the inevitable question of, "Why don't you just ignore them?" Well, because I have limited ignore slots, and in the case of Alphabet, I need to know if you're causing a train. In Woodywoodpecker's case, he was using /shout, /ooc, and /auc to get a bind. I could have ignored him, but I like to be consistent.<P>I don't petition clever twists on names. Creativity is a good thing. Woodywoodpecker is neither creative or clever. Neither is Vixx Vaporub. Karn Age is also pretty friggin' stupid. Why didn't you name your character Stone or Middle or Nookulear? Those names are every bit as stupid when you take your last name into account. Your first name was decent, but it's obvious you intended to make a horrible and distracting play on carnage. Why not create a character with the name Barsher Barshlotsostunteez? It's about as creative. Were I on VZ I would have spanked you, let you retrieve your corpse, and then petitioned you. <P>If your idea of having fun is inventing the stupidest name possible, try Yahoo! chat. AOL is also an option. <P>*side note to Karn*<P>The GMs, Guides, and anyone else you can think of won't be changing my names after fourteen months. They won't be changing mine period. I put my time into choosing a name that was fitting and inventive rather than annoying and stupid.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello all<BR>     It seems that VI needs to re-educate itself on some aspects of customer relations.  This is not meant to be a flame of any type, but you guys need to have some kind of consistency in the way you are dealing with this name changing issues.  You really should try and give the customer both the courtesy and the opportunity to explain their choice of names, and why they should be allowed to keep it (in the case of names that are not blatently offensive).  Its also true that you  need to apply these rules in a consistent manner, and that includes guides and gm's, as well as the pc's.  Most of us wouldn't even be here if we felt that we and others were being treated fairly, or at least like everyone else.  Personally, I feel its wrong of you to co-opt names that PC's already have for game use, especially long term, well established players.  It also seems that politely contacting the players involved and letting them know what you intend to do, giving them time for rebuttal, and then Consistently applying the rules would go a long way towards making people happy.  <BR>     One of the reasons you guys seem to get flamed so much on these boards is the heavy-handed, sometimes rude, and inconsistent way in which you enforce the rules.  We all understand the need for rules, but there is no need for treating everyone like we are all out to get something.  It also wouldn't hurt to admit when you make a mistake, and that includes circumventing your own name change process as in thew case of Karn, even if you feel the end result was fair.  That player used a gm/guide for revenge, and got away with it, and Karn was not given any chance to defend himself.<BR>  I do realize that there is much of the gm/guide job that I and others who have not been there are not aware of, but they are "employees" dealing with customers, and should remember that at all times.

</FONT><HR>I think many of you are missing the point here...<BR>Verant has a policy when it comes to names. There are rules that are supposed to be followed. These people who used these names "knew" what the naming policies are, because I believe it's in one of those "I agree" disclaimers they put in. By clicking "I agree" you are saying that you have read, and understand the policies Verant has laid out. Do I think there's anything wrong with the names some people use? No. Do I think Verant should be a bit more leneat? Yes. I believe that Verant missed these names for so long, and in doing so, these people, (Karn, Grogsmash, etc.) gained a reputation with these names. I believe it was wrong to do this, but Verant has policies, and they have every right to follow through with them. What's wrong with Karn you ask? That name is specifically stated as an illegal name. What's wrong with Grogsmash Dahummies? Words or fragments such as Da, De, etc, may not be used as they imply a title. Is Dahummies a title? No, but it's still against the policy. If I ever choose an illegal name for a character, I will expect it to get changed. If you don't like the policy, leave the game, and go play AC, or UO, or something else. I hate whiners, and I think people whining on this board will turn me off WAY before anything Verant does.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It's a bad business practice to go around upsetting your best and most fervent players.  These are the people who get their friends to join when these types of games come out.  Characters form reputations and all of that is based on their name and that is important.  Now I agree with Verant that they have a naming policy and it needs to be followed and enforced, but the problem is that they do not enforce it on their own or with any consistency.  Here is my proposed solution:<BR>1.  Put a warning when creating names that they must be reviewed.<BR>2.  Actually review the names.  This can be done either at name creation or a later time.  Verant can allow the player to create the character, with the restriction that it is a temporary name until Verant approves it.  Players would petition a GM for approval and only then would it become legal.  This can be done also (and/or) upon receving a last name.  If it is too much work to do this for all new players, have it done anytime a player reaches level 10 (or whatever level Verant wants to use).<BR>3.  Once a name is approved, the player no longer has to worry about their name and reputation being ruined.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sheesh SloboDan, lighten up.  Remember this game is played by many different types and levels of people.  Some of the younger players naturally will create names that seem immature or unimaginative, because they are.  That does not mean to say that we need to be intolerant of what they perceive to be humorous or clever.  No, the whole point of the discussion on the naming policy I believe is that Verant is not consistant with the enforcement and is too reactionary.  As for players who petition other players because of their names, what's wrong with you guys?  I can see if the name was offensive in some way to you, but are you guys getting some sort of perverse enjoyment out of this?  What's the matter?  Mommy didn't breastfeed you or you got beat up at school too much?

</FONT><HR>For the record I've found that (lately) all my petitions are answered in a timely fashion and have seen no inconsistancies when petitioning a name or asking for assistance.<P>As for the complaints that have been made about having a name changed after 50+ levels I find little to sympathize with. I have a dear friend who has a talent for this game- he has leveled many characters over 50th level with ease and when he was done with them he donated all of his items and deleted the character and started again. I know that there are many other such players out there which means ones level does not denote the length of time that they have played. Many can reach 50 in no time- just observe some of the uber guilds. What they can do with a character is sick.<P>This same friend has always created the most original names for his characters because (as he's expressed to me) he enjoys having a name that noone else is likely to have. In the earlier phase of his playtime in EQ he had created some very original surnames for himself but each time others would copy his name or alter it slightly for themselves. Now he refuses to have a last name and goes around as a lvl 52 Vicar with only his first name to go by. <P>As for me I choose to petition improper or unbefitting names because my real grievance is with players who walk around conversing in d00d speak while in RP mode. While I can't do much about that I certainly can petition their gawd-awful names. It's like therapy.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> I'm just sick and tired of seeing wood elves spouting off "Yo Wassup!" or "I got yo back G!" to trolls while in role-play mode.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

They take away our ability as players and paying customers to have some semblance of identity.   They wish us all to become like robots in their vision of a so-called fantasy world.   They don't wish us to stand out in any fashion cause this might throw off the so called balance they wish to create.

There are some parts of it in the license agreement saying something about not using brand names and trademarks. I haven't found anything in my software manuals/ disclaimers/ licenseagreement or printed manual that says anything about not using NPC names (which it is impossible to know all) or other names that sounds like real words. I didn't know about it until just a few weeks back when I surfed to the EqVault forums. <P>BTW Imagine the following scenario:<BR>What if a player makes up a real fantasy sounding name thats not offensive to anyone on the globe regardless of religion, race, cultural background or speaking any existing language. Verant introduces a new NPC in a patch with a similar or identical name. Does that mean that the player have to change name?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I mean if they changed Optical (who is one of the most helpful Paladins on our server) they should change that one also.  And come on i started playing eq a year ago the only server i been on is vz (not counting 2 weeks of stupidity on a carebear) I learned to play this game from guys like preecha and karn.  It is a true shame that we lose them.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Please respond to this Verant (again).  90% of the people in this thread have extremely valid points.  Please don't just make your statement and leave.<P>Of course, I have detailed the points I want addressed before, but I will say them again:<P>A) If, according to Absor, the naming policy protects players against names that do not fit the setting, how can you possibly tell me Lars Ulrich and Metallica fit the setting of the West Karana barbarian village.  There are many other examples of this same hypocrisy.<P>B) According to the naming policy...verbatim: <P>"For categories 3-10, the Senior staff member will contact you to initiate a discussion about the name change. When you have chosen a new name and have looted any outstanding corpses, the CS representative will perform your name change. Please be aware that if you do not choose a name within a reasonable amount of time, a new name will be assigned to your character. Furthermore, it is your responsibility to inform the Senior staff member of the existence of any unlooted corpses that you own. After your name is changed, those corpses will not be lootable, and no reimbursements will be given."<P>How can you tell us that this policy is being used.  According to JediElder's post on a different thread (link posted in an earlier post of mine), when he asked for more time to think of a name, it was immediately changed at thediscretion of the GM.  I have been in a zone where someone had his changed within 10 minutes of first hearing his name was in violation.  Is 10 minutes a reasonabe amount of time.  Please read my post on page 1 or 2 of this thread detailing the process that should occur whenever a questionable name is encountered.  I used this analogy before, and I'll use it again.  If you are pulled over for speeding, you don't write the check out immediately.  You are given a court date to defend yourself.  Due process, Verant, is needed in something as important (yes, I and many others feel it is important) as changing a name.<P>C) Make the Naming Policy more clear.  13 and over (i believe; couldn't find exact age on this web page) is the age requirement for this game.  Even if you forced a 13 year old (or many adults for that matter) to read the EULA, which is in fact the ONLY document the game forces you to click I agree to, many of them would not get that making a name such as Karn, is against the policy.  What needs to be done? Simple.  When the "Create Nex Character" button is pressed, a dialog box pops up telling the player <P>"Refer to the naming policy located at www.everquest.com.  Click on Naming Policy to view.  Any names found to violate these rules are subject to change at the discretion of the GMs or Guides"<P>Yes I know that some players view it as unnecessary as t says in the EULA to refer to the Rules of Conduct, but as everyone loves speeding analogies, they post the speed limit on big signs every few miles or so.<P>I, and many others, would like a better response Absor or Abashi.  Please give us one.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"I'm sorry that the name changes bother you so much. But it's not as though we've hidden the rules about naming characters. It is unfortunate that names breaking the rules remain in the game so long, and therefore the players get attached to them. But the rules are pretty clear, and we do our best to stick by our rules as tightly as we can. And those rules have existed since the game was opened, not thirty days into it."<P>At least 50% of the names I see every day violate your naming policy.  If I wanted to I could report every one of them.  I won't, but I mention it because if I can do it, so can anybody -- just imagine if you lost your name, and had to go around seeing others with names like "Pantload" or "Phatguy", "Daboss" or "Gurlphukr"; you'd be thinking, why the hell did I lose my name "Ghandolph" (or whatever) but they get to keep theirs?  It would tend to reek of favoritism and they might go on a reporting spree, thereby spreading the resentment in all directions.  It doesn't take much to see how that is a self perpetuating cycle, and one that ultimately could be very damaging to business.<P>"Again, I'm sorry if the name changes upset anyone, but we're pretty firm about it and we think that it adds a lot to the game to have charactes with names that fit the setting."<P>What about Phloatin Highbrow and his daughter Sinnkin Highbrow in Erudin?  These NPC names are in clear violation of your own naming policy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>When I first heard of this thread, I almost didn't belive it existed. Verant's naming rules are not represented in the manual nor in the license agreement (you all probably know that by now). If I am supposed to choose a name that is not offending to anyone, It will take a loooong time. Most of the characters I have met in the game (that didn't use the random-name function) have, in some way, a "funny" name or based on e.g tolkien characters or non-english words. I know of one who has the same name as a swedish butter brand. Not that I think that the butter company will sue him or even care, but the name is apparently against the naming policy which didn't exist at that time.<BR>If we customers are supposed to follow these rules, why doesn't Verant do the same? If you remove the "U" in "Kunark" it results in a Swedish word for drugs.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I see, Kunark is a Wild West world and you have a marketing contract with the Wells Fargo Corp. right? Or how else are you willing to explain the bankers names? However, besides all this I have to confess that, as a European, for me the topic is real amusing. Why? Because I assume that whoever is responsible for control of the name policy has no clue at all what names are really in use on your servers. In fact it has a very special and ironic element, that in this you discriminate your anglosaxon customers, just out of inability to control all players with another native tongue. <BR>Now seriously, a name policy that has hardly any control over all the meanings of used names in all the used languages makes not much sense at all. And besides that, let me take up the example Preecher, not that I know him. In all cultures and languages and I mean IN ALL, names like Smith, i.e. terms for professions are absolutely normal. A Yahoo people search gets me 20 hits for surname Preacher, a few hundred for priest. From my point of view a name like Preecher EASILY fits the setting. At least FAR better than any wannabe Wells Fargo Clone that is supposed to represent the High Elf colony of Firiona.<P>&lt;rant mode off&gt;<P>This name policy as well as the way it is handles urgently needs a review.<P>Cheers<BR>7blue<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
