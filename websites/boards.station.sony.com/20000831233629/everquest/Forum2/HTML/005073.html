</FONT><HR>heatsink, check out the section of the FAQ that deals with why NPCs must be stronger than PCs in most cases.  The short of it is: <P>1. It's a group game.  If the NPC were no stronger than a player of a particular level, it certainly wouldn't be a challenge for two.  <BR>2. You are smarter than the NPC.

</FONT><HR>Hiyas!<P>Its just the scale of the game.  If they wanted too, they could give the monsters in the game the same combat abilities as PCs (which would be very fair IMHO).  However, something would have to change to compensate...because then a 50 level person would be out there soloing 50 level monsters and a party of 50th level peeps would have to find level 60 mobs to be challenged (if they'd even be challenged then).<P>Trust me, it gets much worse....mobs will hit for 200 to 300 points of damage.  They'll do so rather quickly.  Only by using teamwork can a group hope to take down mobs at later levels (well, unless you're a necro).<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Gordon say:<BR>&gt;1. It's a group game. If the NPC were no stronger &gt;than a player of a particular level, it certainly &gt;wouldn't be a challenge for two. <BR>&gt;2. You are smarter than the NPC. The NPC gets &gt;some extras for being computer-controlled, and &gt;therefore not as intelligent or adaptive than the &gt;average human.<BR>&gt;-Gordon<P>1.So what? That would just mean a group of players could kill mobs that are higher level than any of them are.  As players increase levels the current system just shortchanges players on XP more and more since they have to fight lower level mobs.  In a level based game, a player warrior should have relatively the same abilities of an NPC warrior, or any other class for example.  It's silly to have two scales on level power, one for NPCs and one for players.<P>2.The average player may be smarter than an NPC but does his/her class have the tools available to exercise it?  Can a melee class do anything but stand there while autoattack swings away?  Spell casters, however, have significantly more tools available (snare, root, fear, etc.) to keep from getting beat on while still delivering damage.  Being a smart player for some classes is just absolutely worthless without some options to put that smartness to good use.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>LoL, I think Adarae just made the best argument possible that he (she? it?) ISN'T smarter than mobs. Silly child, sleep on it next time. heatsink, I think you may be paddling the same canoe as Adarae but why in god's name would you think it was a game if it wasn't a challenge? PCs don't have infinite abilities because the challenge comes from working with what you have. Like when your parents wanted a sentient child but they had to take what they got. I think I CAN help you though. You want a game where you can deal with a threat that is equally mentally constipated as you but you want to sit and do nothing in order to do it (i.e. hum NSYNC like now.) In my many travels of the world, there is only ONE place I have seen that may be your thing: AOL chatrooms.<BR>Go pick up that Harry Potter book your grandma bought you for back to school and excercise your brain. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I'm not as interested in the answers given there as much as I'm interested WHY those are the answers. <BR> Such as why Gordon states that it would be bad for two players of the same level as a mob being able to kill that mob without a challenge, assuming equal power of the two players and the mob(IE the same level)?<P> Obviously those same two players would find tougher mobs to kill since that would give more XP for their time.

If you do anything other than fight a monster face to face, you are either PENALIZED, or suspended. Look at the facts. Dot Nerf, suspension for pathing exploitation. Cut the BS abashi, you know they are right. <P>You're just being argumentative.  <P>You are smarter than the NPCs, and you can play smarter than the NPCs.  You can choose your combats (in most cases), you can decide how many friends you are going to bring, you can decide different tactics that could be used and decide on the best.  As a necro, for instance, the tactic I used varied depending on what I was engaging.  The same is true for many classes, with exception to the bread and butter staples. <P>An NPC isn't going to say "Holy...." and run off when he sees you and your group run into the dungeon, go get a bunch of friends, and set up an ambush.  An NPC isn't going to kite you.  An NPC usually isn't going to cast the best spell he can.

</FONT><HR>&gt;You're just being argumentative.<P>&gt;You are smarter than the NPCs, and you can play smarter than the NPCs.&lt;<P>Depending on what class you play.  Warriors can use strafing to run monsters around and shoot them with arrows, but this would cost a LOT, not to mention arrow pathing royally sucks.<P>&gt;You can choose your combats (in most cases), you can decide how many friends you are going to bring, you can decide different tactics that could be used and decide on the best. As a necro, for instance, the tactic I used varied depending on what I was engaging. The same is true for many classes, with exception to the bread and butter staples.&lt;&lt;<P>With necros, it doesn't matter what the monster was other than living or undead.  The tactics you use as a necromancer depend on what spells you have.  For example, I wouldn't use a pet and poison bolt to kill minotaurs, I use my level 12 spells.  The only 3 level twelve spells that can be used offensively(sp?) are Engulfing Darkness, Heat Blood, and Lifedraw.  Oh yeah the pet too, but they suck until 24 anyway so we might as well just kite without them. <P>&gt;&gt;An NPC isn't going to say "Holy...." and run off when he sees you and your group run into the dungeon, go get a bunch of friends, and set up an ambush.&lt;&lt; No, however they do run off when they get low on life and bring friends.  Also, try hunting in oasis of marr with a level 14 wizard, the blue tarantulas and madmen in the back toward the Sro zone.  The madmen are intelligent there, I swear, every time I pulled a tarantula a madman was hiding inside of it.  I played my last day as Finbik the wizard from 8:00 A.M. as a level 14 wizard with half a bar of experience until 12:00 that night as Finbik as a level 14 wizard with 4 bubbles of experience.  Now tell me again that they don't trick players.<P>&gt;An NPC isn't going to kite you. An NPC usually isn't going to cast the best spell he can. Enchanter NPCs don't keep your entire party mez'd while his group of buddies beats on your cleric.&lt;<P>No, but monsters run faster than players, so they do in fact FEAR KITE Abashi.  For no mana too.<P>&gt;You are allowed to develop different tactics, just not those that allow you to do things without risk, or with significantly less risk than was intended. We're never going to ban you because you put together a thoroughly talanted and balanced group.&lt;<P>But what you will do is you will come here one day and a class is complaining that so and so's class has this ability and you'll see his reasoning of why this is overpowered;  then you will nerf the ability and make that group no longer effective.<P>&gt;We're not going to ban you for adding a sixth person to your five person group. We're not going to ban you for deciding that 5 NPCs in a camp together might be a little bit rough.

I would use bash, but that did no good. Because it would just cast again right after I used bash. Also it had an endless amout of mana.

</FONT><HR>Blah, blah, blah.<P>We've heard it before and we'll hear it again. That if one person could take out a MOB then what's the point of grouping...<P>Heard that speel so many times that I'm sick of it. This is not a soloing vs grouping issue. This is a 'man this NPC that is lower level than me is making me look like a baby' issue. I want to feel heroic. When I play PnP games, the characters might be much more powerful than that orc over there, but I'll tell you when faced against a hunting group of 'em, sudddenly they don't seem so weak. Get my drift?<P>Here's another one. Verant hates pulling. I don't know why, and I don't really care. What I do know is that if we couldn't pull singles or even triples in Cazic Thule, then noone would go there. How, oh how, are we supposed to beat off, about 8 lizzies, at least two of which will possibly heal, two gorillas, and a possible TWO named spawns, one of which can charm, if we arn't supposed to pull? (Lower TR) This is because they are so much more powerful than us, characters.<P>Now, if they weren't... if NPCs were about as powerful as us, or (heaven forbid) weaker, then we could rush in there like real heros, swinging swords, casting spells, and fending them off, while working as a team against superior odds (like in most fantasy novels).<P>This is just a particular example. I'm sure there are better, and worse. It just seems like lazy work on the way the MOBs and players interact on Verant's part, if you don't mind me saying so.<P>I'm not talking about balance or gameplay or anything like that. I'm talking about heroics and the classic pitting a small group against a large overshadowing enemy and coming out on top. (Lord of the Rings, Wizard's First Rule, Star Wars, etc) I'm sure it could be balance, but I'm not paid to do that, I just want to have fun, and at least imagine that my little dorf isn't a complete wuss.
