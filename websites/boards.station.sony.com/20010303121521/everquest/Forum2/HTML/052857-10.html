</FONT><HR>I certainly hope this post doesn't get lost in the shuffle...<P>To say I am disappointed would be an understatement. We asked if it was overpowered 6 months ago and were told it wasn't by Gordon himself. Now, we knew good and well that this was one of the uses and it certainly didn't take us 6 months to find it. We assumed it was a gift to high level clerics because this item is very hard to obtain. The point of CH is if it can't kill you in the casting time then you will kill it. And the number of mobs a fully buffed tank can fight solo without getting killed in 20 or 30 seconds is very small.<P>Obviously you will never be satisfied with this item but you're taking the MoK route and overnerfing it. So let's just skip to an equitable solution...<P>CHANGE THE EFFECT TO A 20 SECOND DIVINE LIGHT<P>This gives the BP usability, doesn't allow anyone to solo anything and doesn't make the BP of Stability any better. This offers 900 HP every 20 seconds or 2700 HP per minute.<P>This also saves your coders some work in so far as they don't have to code this. It saves us hassle AND leaves the item where it is usable.<P>Once more for emphasis<P>CHANGE THE EFFECT TO A 20 SECOND DIVINE LIGHT<P>Thank you for reading this.<P>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>54 vicar of Prexus<BR>Cazic Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think the one big question that I did not see asked (sorry if it was and I missed it while skimming through) is are the mobs going to be downtuned before the nerf goes in? Ar during the same patch?<P>It seems to me that while the mobs are tuned for the breastplate as it exists now, then the breastplate also should remain in its current state.

</FONT><HR>Quoting Absor:<P>&gt;How are we supposed to find a trick that it took &gt;300,000 people 6 months to figure out?<P>&gt;Honestly? I think we should have deleted the &gt;item the first time it became a problem. No &gt;single item should exists that defines a class &gt;or makes us worry about it being unbalanced. &gt;Those items have the power to destroy the game.<P>What a complete load of crap!  I have never heard anything so condescending in my life.  Lets face it, this change is not about "saving the game", its about saving Verant's revenue stream.  Any ability that is nerfed is done to slow down leveling, or increase the possibility of death.  Why do you say ?  To keep you playing longer and so that $10 a month keeps going to Verant.  This was strictly a business decision, anything other explanation in an outright lie !</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Would you be kind enough to tell me HOW this item is going to ruin the game? Your posts rant on and on about how this is an imbalanced item, how it is going to ruin the game, how you will have to change the game to reflect it. Um, hello? What the hell do you call Dain, Velkator, Yelinak? You expect people to kill these mobs with their current manapool? Again, do you actually play this game? Not that you'll read or respond to my post, but I really think you should start a level 1 cleric and see how it brightens your day as you sit med heal, sit med heal.<P>Let me enlighten you on something. My guild has killed trakanon approx 30 times on Xev, we have had ONE donal's BP drop. Gee, sounds like the item is in serious numbers. Excuse the sarcasm of this post, because my $10 a month doesnt seem to mean a thing. <P>Zarach Lionstar &lt;The Harmonium&gt;<BR>High Priest - Xev</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sorry if I'm reposting something already said, but really, 30 second cast time? come on.. There's a big logic flaw here.. IF a cleric were to be with a warrior and they wanted to take out anything they wanted, this means the cleric would probably have to start casting soon as the mob was engaged and not be agroed.. How close to death can a warrior be and have 30 seconds to last until a full heal? Complete heal would be a fine thing to turn the tide of a battle from a one time cast, but not if it means the cleric has to cast for 3 seconds and not be interrupted in that time! The recast time is what seems to be needed to balance this, and it sounds like a buff would be a step in the right direction, but to keep the 30 second casting time is just wrong.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I'm not sure why it would take more than two people to figure it out anyway - the item casts Complete Heal, Clerics heal Warriors since Warriors cannot heal themselves (duh).  <P>I think EverQuest is designed incredibly well, and this item obviously was put into the game for a reason - it's not as if you just discovered the effect wasn't Remedy or something similar.  I also think it's appropriate reward for the risk involved in obtaining it.  <P>Having a Buff is inappropriate, because in 7.5 minutes, it's game over on any raid.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just my thought on this.<BR>  I can see where the item might need to be changed.  What I don't see is how the item got that powerful and made it through testing.  Manaless complete heal, that's giving a cleric one of there best combat spells for no mana.  With all the un-happiness that comes about from nerfing an item in the game I think somebody really failed on letting this item make it into the game.  I know you can't catch every way a player might use a spell or item in testing, but this method of complete healing a tank while he cuts down the mod is about as obvious as can be.  I remember way back around the release of EQ there was talk of nerfing SOW because they never thought people would use it to fight, was intended just for travel.  When I heard that I couldn't believe that someone testing didn't think of that.  Now i saw a statement made saying, "How are we to catch something that took 300,000 people, 6 months to find."  Well this is kinda funny.  How many of those 300,000 people have fought Trakkanon and had a chance at the breastplate.  If this was an easier to get item it wouldn't have taken that long.  If this item was real common it would have taken 1 or 2 days and a few for this to be realized.  I don't know the solution to it.  I'm happy with EQ overall.  I just read this and said to myself OMG how did they not see that coming in tests.  Now because they didn't see it in tests they have to upset people that have it and upset people that dreamed of having it.<P>Happy Adventuring</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It seems that nothing will disuade you from this course of action. Frankly, I expect up to 20% of the high level characters to quit over this. Not just clerics. You've just taken away the ability to do the big stuff in Velious, and without that why should I still play? Oh, and I'm an enchanter, so it's not like I was ever on the receiving end of a serious CH.<P>If you want to do this, then do it right. I want a PROMISE from Verant that the mobs will be adjusted within one month of the BP nerf. Miss that deadline and restore the BP to it's previous condition until you can actually do things right. Why? Because I don't trust you to live up to your word. In April of last year you said that you would retune Plane of Sky quest rewards and fix the quests that asked for duplicate items that weren't identical.<P>Well, it's nearly 10 months later now and guess what? Plane of Sky quests still suck and my guild alone has had 2-3 quests just EAT every single item used because there were two identically named items needed that weren't actually identical (look at the quest that results in the bard horn or the monk knuckles -- our server GM, useless as he is, even stated that the bard horn was a known bug but still claimed player error and only gave back the items under duress. The monk was never refunded the items he lost).<P>So what I expect to happen with the BP nerf is that next patch the BP will become practically useless. And all the uber mobs will be unkillable. And remain that way for 6 months or more. And so for someone whose only purpose in playing still is to see this neat stuff and prove that we're capable, what's the point? Verant has made it so you're not capable no matter what, so why should you still play?<P>The issue with the BP is not that a warrior/cleric can solo stuff. Frankly, anything that can't kill a single warrior in under 30 seconds doesn't concern me much. There are mobs like Velketor that can kill an uber buffed warrior in under 10 seconds. THAT is what I'm concerned with, and THAT was what the BPs were for.<P>You better be sure your uber mobs are still killable Verant. I personally see no way to defeat Yelinak now. You have to use manaless heals and nukes, but the heal part has just been kissed goodbye. Perhaps we'll figure out a new strategy, but not unless Yelinak is severely retuned. And he's just one among many. Note that you're still limited to roughly 40 people in one place because of network and graphics issues that CANNOT be avoided.<P>Verant, you are skirting the edge of disaster here. I play because my friends play. But we all play because, to some extent, we want to do new and interesting things. If we discover that that's no longer reasonably possible then people will start trickling away. And as people leave we'll do less and less and more will leave because the game has become boring. You have built a house of cards. It is, without doubt, a very tall house with many interesting rooms.<P>But it's still a house of cards.<P>Llarn, Officer of Prophecy<BR>L59 Enchanter, Bertoxxulous</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Of course, they're going to kill the BP anyway.  Look at the "options" they gave us when they killed Mark of Karn.  They announced they were going to do option A...then polled us as to whether we preferred A or a "newly thought of" B.  When the majority of the people responded with "Neither A nor B,"  then went on to provide an even better solution.....Verant shoved A at us any.<P>So the CHeal aspect has been taken away.<P>The monsters should be re-evaluated to compensate for the destruction of the only tool that made it possible to defeat them.  However, they won't be re-evaluated.  Much like all the other "bad for the player" issues, it will be ignored then forgotten when they perform their next "mega-nerf" on some other item.  The monsters will never see a proper balancing.<P>Donal's Breastplate is no longer on my list.  I will not be attending Trakannon raids with my guild.  I used to go in hopes of acquiring one (even though, after 15 raids, I've still not seen one drop -manarobes nearly every time however- and I've never *SEEN* one worn by another player)  Still, I'll not be going, and I suspect a lot of my fellow Clerics will do the same.  I hope so.  For those of you cheering "nerf Donal's!" ...I hope your clerics stop going.   I hope hundreds of Trak raids *don't* happen because there is no Cleric support.<P>However, Verant, there is a way to fix this, turn Donal's into a once-again desired item, make it interesting without being overpowering.  Of course, you'd have to use your imaginations a bit...pull your heads out of whatever they're stuck in...and give us something worthwhile, even (gasp) useful.<BR>-----------------------------------------<BR>Change Donal's Breastplate in this manner:<P>It becomes a one-slot container.  This container can hold ONE gemstone.  The right-click effect would change depending on what gem we put in it.<P>--)&gt; Cat's Eye, Jasper, Peridot - Would result in a Group Symbol of the proper spell.<P>--)&gt; Ruby - Would result in a Complete Heal with no ridiculous 7.5 minute anti-buff. (since Rubies are expensive anyway.)<P>--)&gt; Pearl - Would result in a Complete Heal with the ridiculous 7.5 minute anti-buff<P>--)&gt; Sapphire - Would give us a self-only Clarity II<P>--)&gt; Diamond - Would give us a "res special", and debuff the target.  (The idea that by using a crazy expensive component, we could resurrect someone, remove the Res-effects, and Complete Heal them.)<P>--)&gt; Some of the lower cost gems could teleport us to the various Temples.  Onyx to Neriak.  Bloodstone to Freeport, etc.<P>--)&gt; Another gem might give us invisibility.<P>----------------------------------------------<P>Something like that would provide us a Breastplate that we would "want" to go after, that would provide a number of lesser useful effects, would add more money-sink possibilities to what you already have in place, would maintain your charade that the totally free CH is unbalancing, and by giving us something unique would somewhat make up for the way you're currently slapping us around.<P>Lonzrick L'Amore<BR>Xev</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There have been some good posts/ideas on this subject, which has offset the number of 'nerf nerf nerf' responses.<P>Most games I have ever played (especially tactical ones) have a strategy/method which was not thought of at creation time. These allow you to sail through the hardest areas/levels just by using this singular tactic. Which essentially spoils the game. In this instance it is possible to alter the game and so it will be. <P>Ok, so its tough to get hold of, and is very very rare. Hence why they probably thought hell lets give it something special. Unfortunatly they didn't think it through. It may not have been the hardest strategy to come up with, but nevermind, it was missed and the result is that it will now be balanced to what it SHOULD have been in the first place. People complaining about it being 'nerfed' should be thankful that they got a chance to use (abuse) it whilst it was red hot.<P>Have to admit from reading the posts though I'm not sure its the best solution. But that is for Verant to decide. The possibility of removing the buff and casting agains seems highly plausible and then your back to square one, albeit with a little bit more thought required for the strategy. <P>Using up a buff spot seems extreme and 7.5 minutes seems a long time. Although you will stil admit its a useful item to have. However, I would have thought something like making it a 50% heal, with a powerful regeneration side affect. cast time at about 20 seconds, recast time at about 2 minutes would be good. possibly making that a group heal rather than an individual heal which would then make it superb for grouping as down time is still reduced to next to nothing but takes the slight BSness out of it. <P>Just my own thoughts.<P>As for claiming this is just a method to try and make people keep paying there 10 dollars a month that is laughable. Sure they want you to keep paying, but you will only pay whilst you enjoy playing. And what is the best way to make sure as many people as possible enjoy playing? to retain a balanced game.<P>However all of that said. If it is true that some MOBs are only killable when using the bs healing then maybe they should be toned down, but really that is a side issue. Otherwise what your saying is, these monsters are so tough they can only be killed by me using my bs healing breastplate therefore both the monster and my breastplate must be balanced and everyone else is just unlucky. sensible.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I am still trying to make up my mind whether I want to start a Warrior or a Cleric when I throw my 1 year and 3 months of playing a Wizard in the trash. I play your game less and less, because I realize that the casual gamer will never get any phat lewt, unless they pay cash for it. <BR>     And if you actually take the time to read this post, I hope that you read this part as well.

Oh and, if you do retune these mobs, you will have more classes complaining about how they used to be very useful against velious uber-mobs but are useless now.<P>You are opening a big can of worms that doesnt need to be opened here by nerfing the donals bp thats been in existance for almost a year now.

</FONT><HR>As a cleric only halfway to 60, I doubt that I'll see this BP for a long time. I do think that this BP is overpowered.  Unfortunately, (from what I hear), clerics go OOM during raid situations within several minutes operating at max efficiency. Perhaps along with the target buff, the cleric should get a self only mana-regen or mana-capacity buff. Might also be worth considering a Velious dungeon only high-level spell that would do a self-only large mana regen and capacity buff with long recast/duration.<P>Donai d'Velos<BR>30.96 High Elf Cleric of Tunare<BR>Protectors of Lore</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One more thing, Try to kill any high level mob in SoV or SoK, NO warrior stays alive 15 seconds let alone 30.  <P>The guilds worked hard, very hard to kill the dragon that drops this item, and it's a rare drop.  Not like every time trak is dead this bp drops.  This item is a well earned item that isn't overpowered.  So a war and a cleric can kill a freaking frog in OS because of this.  Who cares?  How is this an imbalance?  <P>A fully decked out level 60 tank in full Cobolt can not survive ANY high level mob for 30 seconds.

</FONT><HR>Well ... i gave it some thought and i would agree that the bp is maybe too good, its of course the Cheal for no mana at all that makes it so good.<BR>The idea of making it a buff seems like a good idea. <BR>However there were a few posts about making all Cheal a buff so it can only be used once a fight so the mobs could be tuned down ... well ... that's not a good idea, because when that is changed it is the end of the cleric class i think, because it would mean the cleric is not needed anymore at all ... if his most powerfull heal can only be used once on somebody then his job could be taken by the other healing classes.<P>The argument that a cleric can med the mana it saves from the bp by enchanter buffs and dumping of mana is a nice one and probably true but has one good side effect namely .. those classes have to be there so they become vital to those encounters too.<P>Nowred 54 cleric<BR>Gamaliel 52 druid<BR>Less 37 shaman</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A couple thoughts for changes to the BP.  Change the spell to Superior Healing, 15-20 second cast time or here is a thought:  Yes, clerics are healers first and foremost, but we are also undead killers therefore... Effect: Banish Undead, 15 second cast time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If you're going to make the BP only usable on a single character once every 7.5 minutes, you should reduce the BP cast time back down to the normal cast time of complete heal... this will allow it to be used in emergencies, but not in the primary fashion.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I skipped the last 5 pages because I already spent way more time reading this (away from playing) then I wanted to.<P>Simply if you want this to be a downtime item then make it stun the target for x amount of time. this amount should not be so much that it would kill the party if a wanderer comes by but should be sufficient to make the target useless if this is used on them in combat.<P>good health to you all<BR>laros</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First I gotta say everyone in the last 10 pages of posts say everything that I would have to say about this NERF.  This is the second time you've NERFED this item (hmmmmm, maybe you shouldn't have introduced in the first place, but i degress).<P>Do not, I repeat DO NOT, have this 1 tick regen buff component overwrite druid or shaman chloro or regrowth.

</FONT><HR>I challenge Verant to post the logs of their tester/players (who are reasonably to highly equipped for that level) fighting Yelinak, or King Tormax, or similar powered mobs, both with this BP as is, and  then again with all the "proposed changes" including the "make the mob easier" change.  When the testers can kill the MOB with 24-30 people MAX (to reflect the real player lag and linkdeath constraint) in a close fight with deaths, I will say the change is balanced, whatever one works out the best.  <P>Until Verant posts such things, I don't want to hear from Verant about testing and unbalancing issues.  That is like telling me the sky is red while I am still inside.  Prove it to me, don't tell me and expect me to believe it.<P>As for a cleric and warrior killing anything that cannot kil the warrior in under 30 seconds, so why is this unbalancing?  Nothing worth killing by a cleric and warrior who have this BP will fail to kill the warrior under that time constraint.  If I am wrong, again, SHOW ME.  <P>So this warrior and cleric can head to OS and farm frogs and get 1,000,000pp and gems in a week.  Aside from being mind-numbing, WHAT IS SUCH A WARRIOR OR CLERIC GOING TO BUY AT THAT LEVEL? Anything such characters want cannot be purchased because it is too rare to even BE sold.<P>Verants current testing policy: throw an item in the game, then wait to see what the Uber guilds do with it when they fight the uber mobs.  Why hire game testers at all when you have people paying you (Verant) $10/mo. to test it *for* you?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 11 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;10&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-11.html">11</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052857&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052857&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
