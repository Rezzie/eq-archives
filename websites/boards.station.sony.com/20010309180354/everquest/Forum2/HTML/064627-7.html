</FONT><HR>I would like to add my 2cp in on this as well. Multi-Questing is BAD. Having your friends help you is not. I can see a solution here... Remove No Drop tags from items that are used to quest with. Put a LvL minimum on them, the minimum level to hold the item would be just a few levels lower than what lvl the quest was intended for. There, no low lvl Uber twinks (although de-leveling is still a major problem), not really getting rid of multi-questing (in a sense), and do what you said about the NPC's giving back the items. You should also make it that if someone currently owns the finished product of these quest items that they would not be able to the quest items. LvL minimums should have been in place since the very beginning, it makes sense. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It seems to me that the idea of questing is that someone is able to collect the items that are needed, turn them in and be rewarded for doing the work.<P>Multi-questing goes against this intent.  It not only gets around what should be the intent behind quests, it encourages terrible behavior in-game such as kill-stealing and the like.<P>This proposed fix not only eliminates this rediculous multi-questing phenomenon, it also helps out the people who accidentally turn in the wrong item, or collect incorrect components.  Granted, people should always double-check what they're turning in, but hey, in a lot of cases the items share the same graphics.<P>Make the change, thwart multi-questing, make people earn their items again and bullet-proof the questing process for those who just aren't careful enough.  I think this is a GREAT change.<P>One minor aside: What if someone turns in all of the appropriate items for a quest, as well as one or more additional items?  Perhaps they're guessing and just turning in whatever they think might work?  Just something to ponder...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I'm closing in on 60 and it's still practically impossible to slip into the 24/7 AC camp for jboots because of people farming the ring to sell/multiquest with others.<P>Right now a friend is holding a chardok king scroll we'd planned to multiquest with me once Ixiblat dies (I went LD during the fight, it wasn't sure if anyone would be able to loot the king since he poofed through a wall).  But in a heartbeat I'd go kill the king again if it would reduce the number of folks on Karana that farm the AC ring to sell to other players.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Call it what you want, it's a proposed nerf against multi questing.  Your proposal is saying that teamwork will be disallowed so that stupidity is not penalized.<P>It takes absurd amounts of time to do some of these quests, time that is just spent sitting on your ass waiting for the magic thing to happen so you can finally get out of the misery.  There is no sense of accomplishment, just relief that it's over, only a masocist would want to do a major quest themselves without their guilds help or spoilers.  It's like going to the dentist, it freaking sucks, but you know you have to do it.<P>I would guess that the majority of those against multiquesting are low level, or play the solo game.  Certainly anyone that plays the higher level game and is in a decent guild knows how important teamwork is, and multi questing is a part of that team work.  <P>It's so sad to see people raising hell about things on the boards and not even realize they are just hurting themselves, someday you will get high level, or join a good guild and realize how bad you screwed yourselves by posting the things you did.<P>Anyone who posts in favor of nerfing multi questing, do me a favor, post if you have done your VP key or epic quest or not, anyone who has suffered though that waste of time and still wants to nerf multiquesting has earned the right to vote however they want.  If you haven't done either you are shooting yourself in the foot thinking you are hurting the "ubers".

</FONT><HR>Eliminating multi-questing would be a bad idea. I recently came across a piece of corroded plate armor while hunting in KD with a shaman. Neither one of us could use this piece of armor, but both of us knew people that could. There was no one else in the zone at the time, so we (I) looted it. This armor piece is no drop and EXTREMELY rare, killing multi-questing would make it so that this piece of armor would go to waste.<P>You can make it so that if you hand in an incorrect item, it gets handed back to the person, without killing multi-questing. Leave it so that if you hand in the incorrect amount of something, the NPC retains it, as it is now. The number of people that hand in an insufficient amount of things to a quest NPC is small compared to the people that hand in the wrong items. Why mess with one to fix the stupidity of the others?<P>I've handed in the wrong rune doing my Ivy Etched quest in the past, did I go running to a GM to have them give it back to me? No, I kicked myself for being so stupid for not getting it identified before handing it in (a spell a ranger doesn't get but sorely needs). I didn't even THINK about having someone else fix my mistake. I mean really, have some personal responsibility. You screwed up, you pay the price, that's life deal with it. <P>The proposed change wouldn't have even come into effect for my mistake, the quest person needed both pieces I handed in, just not those 2 at the same time.

</FONT><HR> I agree with the change on one condition.........<P><BR> Make the uber rare spawns NOT spawn until someone doing a quest involving that spawn hits the zone. (Or even within a range of the spawn.)<P> A simple flag on a character should do this. The spawn checks, sees a flag, spawns. Sees no flag, no spawn, or spawn placeholder. This would eliminate 24/7 camping in place of raid style snatch and grab. And make drops off the uberrares slant towards quest items. You've already got multiple drop tables on mobs, just adjust them for the flag. You could also make an EPIC drop item class, that would not allow the spawn to die until it is picked up by a level cap class of the type to use the drop.<P> Just some ideas,<P> Mil Mascaras</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

If everyone is so torqued off about the AC part of this quest, make it so that the Jboots can't be multi-quested and leave the rest of the quests alone. You have this ability to change quests so they can't be multiquested, change this one if its so wrong. Are there so many other quests out there that are being so "abused" that people are screaming to get rid of multiquesting completly? I don't think so.

</FONT><HR>The one thing I think this really effects is the casual gamer. I have several real life friends that do not play as much as I do not because they don't want to but that they just dont have the time. They help me from time to time on some things in the game and in return I help them get the hardest and oftem most time consuming part of a quest. If you end multi-questing then the casual gammer that rely on help from others to complete these quests will no longer be able to get quest items. This change will be dramtic and wont stop twinks from getting the quest items all it will do is require the twink to log on to loot the mob after it is killed so that the twink has all the items on him to turn in. you will add one more step to slow the ability to twink a character but it will destroy the ability for the casual gammer to have fun.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>While the change would be a good one, I feel that what is really needed is to eliminate the no drop from most quest components.  Quests like brain bite(the overly difficult wizard quest) for example are three part, you have three jars to capture the souls of three wizards.  Now, there's no reason why each of these needs to be no drop.  So, you SHOULD be able to trade quest components for this, even though at the end, you will need to turn them all in yourself.<P>This type of thing would encourage multiple people to work together for a combined goal, or to have people hireing other PCs to help with a quest, or give out quests.  As long as people don't try to farm the quest items, there won't be a problem.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>In a perfect word, ALL quests SHOULD be changed at least that way:<P>You should have a way to tell if a PC has already done a quest or not. Then there are 3 kind of quest that are or should mainly be in the game:<P>a) Quest for faction. Some faction can only be gained by doing quest, some faction come from beasts killed and quest.<BR>aa)If you want to have the usual ranger hunter quest to get rid of nuisances, put very common things on the mobs, like the scalps on gnoll pups. And make the quest work when you hand a total of 20, 40 or 60 stackable items.<BR>ab) when its the quest for BIG faction hit or a RARE faction hit: make the quest be done only once. Usually it should be the case for all quest that require you to kill or do something with a NAMED NPC. You will give a real big faction hit (like 200 to 600 in old system).<P>b) Quest for item. Dont give faction hits for those quests. If the item is mundane and it requires anonymous mobs to be killed, leave it the way it is.<BR>If its a GOOD item, dont allow the quest to be given if you already have this item on your character and make the item no drop and lore.<P>c) Quest for exp. some of those quest should exist more. Either way you need to also see if those quest can be done only once (and big reward) or 1000 times (and low reward).<P>Thoughts:<BR>Now; quest work so badly in a roleplay point of view that I usually do a LOT of parts of big quest only to get faction. Thats dumb but thats the only way the game is designed.<P>So that smart enchanter NPC see me and ask me to kill the ONLY and UNIQUE bad NPC he knows but I can kill the guy 400 times and get 400 times the faction hit. The problem is that the game is designed so I NEED that faction hits and its the ONLY way to get the faction hit.<P>ABOUT MULTIQUESTING<P>If we would be on a perfect word, I would say: get away with multiquesting.<BR>BUT<BR>Since 2 years  I play EQ, from the day ONE of the game I play, the quest I do have been bugged, broken and that the only part EQ team will never comment except this way:<P>Day 1. new NPC give quest.<BR>Day 5. tried for 4 days to solve that quest.<BR>Day 10. Still no items drop for giving back to the NPC.<BR>Day 15. Pacth. The NPC say something different.<BR>Day 20. After you hand the NPC the items you finnaly get after the patch was done (wuithout no notice items were not in game before) he give you 2nd part of quest.<BR>Day 40. 2nd part of quest still unsolved.<BR>Day 80. 3 patch later, about 20 000 people have tried to solve the quest, the items the NPC request SEEMS to not exist.<BR>Day 120. Good luck: Quest is repaired without notice, people who tried to do it have stop trying it. Bad luck: Quest NPC doesnt give the quest anymore. Usual Luck: the quest is removed still without notice but some intermediate NPC still give parts of the quest.<P>As a human druid of karana, I have tried the Jale Phlintoes quest as it is the ONLY quest your guild trainer or master will EVER give you in the game. (the begining is called Nitrates and Assassin quest). I have tried the quest from lvl 1 to level 40 (I am 54 now).<BR>For about 14 months it was broken. Now the 1st part is repaired (and about at least 14 GM and guides said to me it was working before Verant repaired it). But no one in Verant never admit it was broken, (thus it was never "fixed" of course) and it still unfinished.<P>Now think that for multiquesting they will have to check and "repair" about 15 000 different quest in the game that are SUPPOSED to work.<P>And now tell me how many quests will be broken after they TRIED to change the way they work.<P>PLS Verant when you put quests in the game, put them COMPLETE or NOT.<P>Durix Bearfriend<BR>Karana then Ayronae server<BR>Quester of more than 400 DIFFERENT quests.<BR>Sorry killer of about 10 000 small green mobs only for faction adjustements.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Removing multi-questing is guaranteed to break a number of quests, since a lot of quests were implemented with it in mind as a necessary feature.  For just one example, it would break the Paladin Soulfire quest (which in turn would break the Paladin Epic Weapon Quest, since it relies on the Fiery Avenger quest which relies on Soulfire).  Why?  Because to do an early, necessary stage of the quest, you must give four LORE Drom's Champagnes to the drunk Tyklar Renlon in East Freeport.  The only way to do this is to give him one, hit Give, then quickly buy another from the nearby bartender, hand that one over, repeat repeat.  This only works because of the multi-questing feature.<P>Remove the multi-quest mechanism and you break the Soulfire quest, not to mention lord knows how many others like it.  Do you really want to review ALL quests in the game to see which ones won't work anymore if you remove multi-questing (and then redesign them to work again)?   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/eek.gif"><P>2.  As others have pointed out, a lot of upper-level quests become sane only when able to be multi-quested.  If you remove multi-questing, you're going to either have to re-balance a lot of high-level quests, or in effect simply put them out of reach of a lot of people (who aren't going to be happy :mad <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>3.  People have tailored their actions up to this point using the assumption that multi-questing works (and will continue to work).  A lot of people have had friends pick up No Drop quest items for them, or picked up items for friends, relying on the multi-quest mechanism to make this work for them.  For one example, the Paladin Fiery Avenger quest requires too VERY hard to get books, from Vox and Nagafen respectively.  To complicate matters, the books have to be combined in order to get the next item in the quest chain deep in Neriak, where most Paladins are extremely KoS.  So quite a few Paladins have Dark Elf or Enchanter friends loot their books for them, planning on having their non-KoS folks help them by doing the Neriak stage of the quest.  Even more, a Paladin that died during the dragon raid may have had a friend on the raid loot the book so it wouldn't poof before the Paladin could get a rez back to the scene, again counting on multi-questing to ensure that this was viable.  So right now there are a lot of VERY rare, VERY valuable Paladin quest books resting in the hands of friends of Paladins who had to work a LONG time to get those books at all.  Removing multi-questing would suddenly destroy those Paladins' books, in effect, since they'd become almost impossible to use, unless the friend holding the one book so far was dragged along on all raids by the same Paladin, to loot the second book if it happened to drop.  Again, people would NOT be happy if that were suddenly made necessary by a game change.<P>4.  The vast majority of the people yelling "yeah, nerf multi-questing!" are doing so because they're unhappy about the one or two quests (*cough*JBoots*cough*) where multi-questing makes camping/farming worse than it would be otherwise.  There's a simple solution for that -- fix the poorly designed quests that lead to this sort of behavior.  "Fixing" those few quests by destroying multi-questing is using a sledgehammer to swat a fly on your forehead.  As others have pointed out, you can fix the JBoots farming by having Hasten Bootstrutter hand out a combinable container that does the "boot construction" (in exchange for the cash he currently wants as part of the quest list), instead of having him accept the quest items himself and then pass out the boots.  Nice and easy.<P>5.  The best enhancement actually is the easiest to program, AND addresses everyone's concerns, AND makes the most RP sense anyway.  Here it is:<P>a) If EQ were a real world, offering the wrong quest items to a person wouldn't cause him to him swallow your items and spit in your face, it would cause him to him look at your offerring, laugh, and say "I didn't want *THAT*, stupid..."  So make NPCs in Norrath do the same thing (a bit more politely).<P>b) When you hand ANY items to an NPC that is not a full set of the items he wants for a quest (this INCLUDES things like giving meat to bears and so on -- ANY "not a quest" pile of stuff), a pop-up box appears saying, "&lt;targetname&gt; is not sure what to do with your offerring, are you sure you want to hand over your goodies?"  Then the user can hit "Yes" or "No".  "Yes" would then result in the items being given, followed by EXACTLY the existing behavior regarding given items (including multi-questing, etc.).  Answering "No" would result in exactly the same behavior that "Cancel" does on the current Give window.<P>c) The only extra coding this requires is a "post-Give-button, pre-acceptance" check to see if the items constitute a full set of quest items for that NPC.  The acceptance and quest coding remains unchanged.<P>d) It also simulates the real reaction you'd get if Norrath were a real place inhabited by real people, who would say "huh, are you sure?" if you offered them stuff they weren't asking for.<P>e) Why have the bears and such give the same "huh" box?  Because otherwise you open the door to people hannding random cheapo items (e.g. bottle of milk) to every NPC in sight, in order to (too easily) figure out which are quest NPCs and which ones aren't.  You fix this by making ALL NPCs give the same "don't know what to do with" box when offered less than a full set of expected quest items.<P>f) It is guaranteed to leave existing working quests unbroken, and guaranteed to leave multi-questing functional.<P>g) Ideally, it would also give the "huh, are you sure?" message if the quest would have failed due to poor faction.  Aagain, this makes RP sense -- if you were not liked well enough to be issued a quest, a quest-giver would just sneer at you or not even look your way when you tried to give him things for a quest.<P>g) It would also be nice (but not necessary) to add an eqclient.ini setting which would disable the check (thus reverting to the behavior already in place today) for those people who were annoyed by getting a query box every time they tried to dress the banker up with a mandolin.<P>I think this suggestion addresses everyone's concerns (except those who feel that the JBoots quest needs to be fixed so it's not so heavily camped/farmed, but that can and ought to be handled separately).<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alan,<P>One example is part of the soulfire quest, you need to turn in 4 champagnes which are lore in around 20 seconds. The npc doens't refresh that you've given away your copy of the lore item fast enough to do this, it would be IMPOSSIBLE with multiquesting nerfed.<P>The NPC gives you a nice "You can not buy another droms champagne, you have one and it is lore" type message.<P>P.S. I think their should be an off/on switch such as this<P>"May my friends aid me in this task?" If the NPC is designed in mind of multiquesting, allow it. If not then if you turn in incorrect full items he gives it back. <P>You could "select" maybe you don't want jboots to be multiquested anymore, or maybe you want people to have options in where they get their dragon books for FA/D.<P>Sounds like a solution which would both fix lost items and allow for continued multiquesting.<P>I do belive multiquesting is a good thing, it allows not only for some economy and aid on hard to camp items (for people who enjoy waiting for the AC for example for 8 hours) vs people who would rather spend that time exploring and pay someone else to do that.<P>Thanks,<P>Galidin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yes I like the idea. Get rid of multi questing.<BR>Each character should complete every step of the quest to gain the item. Not have some lvl 50+ char gather 99% of the items and the twick hand in the last (and easyest to get) item. <BR>All quest items should be non drop and most of the items that are the rewards should also be non drop.<BR>As for giving back items I have had this happen to me as well and like that idea alot.<BR>A possible solition is to have any NPC give you back all the items you give them if some of the items are non drop. Else they keep the items or complete the quest.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR># "twigger" has an excellent idea. It is on page 2.  Add another button in addition to "Give". Call it "Show", as in show the items to the NPCs.  Put your quest items in the trade window, click "Show" to find out if the NPC is interested in any of the items. #<P>Bad idea, actually.<P>First, it involves more complicated programming than some other ideas do (*cough*my_suggestion*cough*).<P>But primarily, the problem is that it would allow people to "probe" NPCs to see what components the NPC is looking for.  This would be a major exploit, and utterly ruin the usual method of looking for in-game clues for not-yet-solved quests.  Instead, everyone would just offer every oddball item(s) they had to every NPC in sight, until the "Show" screen for one indicated an interest in item X.<P>No thanks.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Multiquesting is part of the game definition.<P>I'm sorry guys, but changing this is just asking for more people to leave the game.<P>You have quests, these quests are meant to be completed by yourself or with the help of your friends. You made items no drop, some rarer than an Epic weapon or a piece of armor off some mob.<P>Now you want to take out the only way people had to actually be able to go sleep or to work, and still being able to complete a quest because their friend got the item instead.<P>Get a clue verant. Fix the way NPCs handle questing mistakes by removing one of the best few things left in game is just plain stupid.<P>Take your time and fix this without removing multiquesting, you are asking too much of a sacrifice to both casual gamers and hard core gamers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 9 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;7&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064627-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=064627&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=064627&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
