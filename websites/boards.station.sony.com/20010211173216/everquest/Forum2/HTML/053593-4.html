</FONT><HR>One last thing:  I think its very poor for monks who have CFs to go around asking that the quests leading up to getting them and the epic quest itself be made harder.  <P>Leave this quest and all earlier quests alone please, including the robe carrying brothers.  Leaving alternatives to tedious quests can only be a good thing.  Just becasue you do not have the people resources to avoid such a terrible camp fest please do not force others to do the same.

</FONT><HR>i have a level 18 monk, and a level 19 rogue, now i had an idea about how these classes could both benifit from the others skills, in a way that would not unbalence them. monks would benifit from getting our evade skill(to be honest they need it almost as much as us)and if we were to share this skill with any class i would be happy letting a monk have it(rather than the rangers), but also i think that rogues would also benifit from having feign death. and as a monk if i were to share this skill(again) i would like it to be with a rogue. the only change in the way the classes opperate would be when the monk is getting pounded and he evades(rather then feigning for some period of time, and looseing much needed attacks), and the rogue only has the benifitof forign for solo'ing(and later on, pulling)not that many rogue solo, another use may be when a rogue is getting pounded so much that every time he hits hide it gives the old "you can not hide while..." then he could feign, thus loosing attacks and having a chance to get the mob to stop beating on him , <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor: _PLEASE_ do not forget our weight restriction. We are tightly bound at 14.9 pounds till level 55 and we should do something shouldnt we? I believe that "The Vision™" states that monks are more or less hybrids between warriors and rogues as far as tanking ability and damage output is concerned respectivly.<P>I still think a nice idea would be an offhand damage bonus and making CFs go from 9/16 to 12/14 steadily by level 60 [rogues have 11/15 weapons in Velious I believe, and that is no good that they do more damage then us without backstab] (a la how our fists really work.) I also still support Bodi's idea 100% - you really should reread it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Add some "Chi" (mana) based skills to give the monk class a little more variety/power.  For example, add special abilities that would use mana to:<P>Give a chance to Stun on your next Special attack.<P>Give a chance to Disable/Snare on your next Special attack.<P>Give a chance to use your next mend skill on someone else.<P>Perform a super leap that would jump 3-4 times as far as a normal jump.<P>Add a short-term burst of speed (Spirit of Cheetah), followed by a period of exhaustion.<P>All of the abilities are limited by the mana cost, mana pool and recovery rate of mana for monks (no med), so the power level could be easily moderated.<P>I'm sure you can come up with much better ideas, but you understand the general concept.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Heres an idea for the off-hand damage bonus that I think addresses the damage issue where most people feel its needed; 50+.  <P>Have the damage bonus be as follows:<P>(level -50)/2<P>This would give an off hand bonus of +5 at 60 (as compared to +11 main hand).  Scale this bonus for higher delay weapons just as it is with the main hand.  <P>This would also be a very compelling reason for monks to just use CFs for weapons so fists would again be king for monks.<P>Combine this addition with making low end specials have a skill specific bonus at higher level (kick=stun etc.), FD not getting buggy in groups, and FD possibly working something like a more penalized 'evade'(you would lose attacks while FD'd) and I would be very happy with my monks place in the grand scheme of things.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This a more of a roleplaying sugestion then anything else.<P>I believe that certain classes especially Monks and Rogues. Should recieve boosts in jumping distances and heights as they level.<P>Maybe every 10 levels Monks/Rogues get a 5% boost in distance and height<P>and the Hybrids get a 3% boost every 10 levels.<P>--------------------------------<P>I mention this because, I thhink that they from a rp perspective are masters of physical abilities and they should be able to move farther then the caster classes who consentrate on magic.<P>Imagine this<BR>---------------<P>It is a dark and stormy night(pardon the cliche) In Kelethin. Shouts arise through out the city as it is found that a vauable trinket has been stolen from the Ranger Guild. Working quickly 2 Rangers and a Traveling monk track down a Dark elf rogue. They have him trapped against a building, but he leaps on top of it and begins to run away leaping from rooftop to rooftop. The trio pursues bounding acroos Kelethin in great strides. The rangers lose a flight of arrows at the fleeing rogue but the rogue artfully dodges them. They continue bounding across the roofs and platforms nearing the elevator. Suddenly the rogues stops and turns around to face the trio. with 2 quick slashes the rogue cuts through the inbounding rangers, sending them to nasty death at the bottom of Kelethin. The Monk manages to reoreint himself in flight and lands away from the rogue's attack. The rogue smiles at him and then continues on towards the elevator. The monk catches up to the rogue and they began to assualt each other as they bound for the elevator. They parry and dodge each other faster then can be seen and soon they have reached the lift. They continue their fight, and then a scream rips through Kelethin.<P><BR>The rogue smiles again and holsters his daggers and jumps off into the distance.*<P>-----------------<P>Well I thought that would be cool. Just a thought.<P>-Grayfox Cy'brNnja<BR> Monk of 21st Fist<P>*No Dark elves or humans were hurt in the writing of this story.

</FONT><HR>Okay, I'm a lower level monk so I doubt anyone will consider what I have to say, but no one will probably read this far into the thread anyway.<P>I play a monk and a shadow knight.  Now eventually my shadow knight got fustrating because I could never afford good enough armor, weapons, jewlry etc. So I made a monk.  Armor isn't so much of an issue, and indeed you don't even need weapons.  Monks are the only melee class that are well armed for corpse runs.  Unfortunatly I found out some rather bad things.  I see twink monks running around all the time with fighting batons and such.  How long will it be before I am turned down to be in a group BECAUSE I don't have any weapons?  How can I afford weapons when I can't loot anything?  I chose a monk because they didn't need weapons or loot, only to find sadly that the opposite was true.  Okay, now for some suggestions.<P>Weightless bag quest.  It's been brought up a lot already, but i think giving a monk a weightless bag would be nice.  You can make it only hold small items, maybe only have 4 slots... just give us SOMETHING.<P>Special abilities for special attacks.  This is a cool idea with my support.  I think it's rather... boring to use the same attack over and over.  Why not give us some more to work with.  I guess I'd suggest giving the special attacks special abilities levels 40+    My ideas<P>Round kick - chance for stunning opponent<BR>Tiger Claw - chance for going off twice (double attack / 2 or something)<BR>Eagle Strike - chance for critical hit<BR>Flying Kick - unmodified (best attack we have after all)<P>I would also like to see more lower level gloves or something that would enhance our punches.  Now there are HIGH level quests, but I would like to see some lower level ones as well.  Or perhaps some gloves that give our punches +1 damage, etc if that is even doable.<P>I would also like to see the headband/sash quests extended (and make them nodrop)<P>I'd also like to see more different looking monk armor.  Right now the only options we have are cured silk, or wear one of the (few) robes that monks are ALLOWED to wear.  I'd suggest some armor that has perhaps the same shape as cured silk, but is all black, or all white.  I mean I know this is doable, and I don't even care if it has better ac or stats, I'd just like to look a bit different from whatever leavel I obtain cured silk. =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>NyogTha said:<P>&gt;&gt;Absor-<BR>We as a monk community need to get several points across to you that we feel you took incorrectly. It is of utmost importance that you understand 100% what was meant by several of the suggestions you put on your "list". So much that if taken incorrectly, your team and co-workers will either implement something that we did not want due to miscommunication or you and your team will simply overlook our ideas.&lt;&lt;<P>Absor, myself and several others disagree with several key points in NyogTha's post.  When he says "We as a monk community..." it is misleading in that it implies a compilation of the monk community's wishlist for the class.<P>Only one such post exists that represents a compilation, and that is the original post from Zadkiel/ValaresTheMonk.<P>NyogTha's comments do not represent me, nor do they represent many others.<P>*I* as a monk strongly oppose the elimination of multi-questing.  Find other ways to eliminate cheats.  (see my post earlier in this thread).<P>Eliminating multi-questing would have to be across all classes.  Does NyogTha's voice represent Paladin's?  Mage's?  Wizards?  Druids?  Rogues?  Warriors? ...<P>Everquest is a group oriented game.  Your group can help you kill a mob.  Your group should be able to help you with quests pieces.  Multi-questing is not an accident.  The drops are so rare, it's almost necessary.  No monk does this solo.  And I wager that over 50% of the current holders of the Celestial Fists multi-quested at least part of it (the pipe most likely).<P>Taking the robe off Brothers Zephyl and Qwinn wouldn't bother me very much.  But understand, while taking down Brother Zephyl is *faster*, it is by no means easier.  <P>The quest method is not difficult.  It is just tedious.  And the main tedious part is the Raster camp.  Raster is a rare spawn *monk* in LowerGuk.  He is level 38.  Most monks go to Guk at about level 45 and solo the entire Mino Elder spot until he spawns.  Many monks finally kill him when they are around level 47 or 48.  It's a long camp, admittedly, but not a total waste of time.  Experience is gained, and monks sell the Chrysoberyl Talisman over and over for 800pp - 1k.  Targin is the other part of the quest, spawns in SolB, and not nearly as tough to get his quest piece since the King room is often camped and his spawn is much more frequent.<P>Now let's look at the "easy way out."  Ganking Zephyl.  Zephyl is a wandering monk in Rathe Mountains.  He is level 60, he has at last count, 27000 hit points.  If you're stupid enough not to give him a 2handed weapon, he's gonna quad for 350 a hit on whatever unfortunate piece of meat you throw in front of him.  He's gonna summon you.  He's gonna resist all but the Lure spells.  You're going to assemble a similar group for him that you would for a dragon.  They are going to spend gobs of money on stones for Cleric buffs.  Don't let them fool you.  So it takes less time to get a robe from Zephyl.  How much time does it take to cultivate that kind of supporting cast in this game?  Think about it, all of that effort for 1 monk?  Those are friends.  And it takes longer to earn that than any Raster camp will ever be.<P>I re-emphasize also that if headbands and sashes are made no drop, then the Iksar race needs an alternate path to the RoTLC.  The RoTLC is not a quest given by the Ashen order.  It is not a quest given by the Silent Fist.  It is a quest given by the beta neutral monks of the lost circle.<P>Bottom line, current CF holders want to feel special.  They don't want to turn every corner and see another CF monk.  And they certainly don't want to see a 30th level CF monk due to some exploit.  I agree that anyone pre-50 should have no shot at getting the fists.  Loopholes need to be tied up.  But the changes they are suggesting may the quest more difficult for even a level 60 monk, particularly if that monk is Iksar.<P>I am actually a bit irked that I have to even write this.  This thread is designed for class balance, and I'd love to be focusing my energies where they need to be.. with monks looking to balance themselves in the post 50 game (pre 50, I think we are fine).  But I feel compelled, unfortunately, to go on the defensive because of the outpour of monks *who have completed their CF quest* now requesting the quest be more difficult so they can remain l33t.<P>Find a way to tighten the loopholes without making the quest more difficult.  Multi-questing when the monk is 5th level is obviously a loophole.  There are creative ways around it that won't punish those of us who aren't exploiting the ability.<P>Vladin<P>p.s.  It's really sad, because the monk community organized and tried to work through our racial differences prior to the Monk Talk thread.  Obviously we didn't do a very good job.  So I guess you can say that Iksar faction with human PC monks isn't very good either.  And there aren't any quests we can do to fix it.  More suffering for the Iksar seems to do the trick  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There is a careful balance in place with melee damage.  In that balance, pure melee classes do the most melee damage in the game.  Within that scheme, Warriors do the least, Monks do the most face-to-face and Rogues have the highest potential output when in the proper circumstances.<P>Many Monks are asking to have their damage raised closer to Rogue levels.  Please consider this:<P>* Rogues can only outdamage Monks in group situations, and not always then.<P>* Rogues at high levels cannot solo many greens, Monks can solo XP delivering mobs all the way to level 60.<P>* Monks with Celestial Fists can outdamage Rogues in most circumstances, including balanced groups. (I believe this is because Rogues are the only heavy damage dual wield class whose Epic is only one weapon; Warriors, Monks and Rangers get their Epic power to both hands)<P>* The balance between Human and Iksar Monks was XP.  Unfortunately, this is ultimately a failure.  Eventually the Iksar will attain the same level and will have radically higher AC and inherent regeneration.  Iksar Monks are very close to be terribly broken and increasing melee output would make them even more ridiculous.<P>Monks currently do enough damage, heal enough (between Mend and Fungi Tunics) and have a good enough safety mechanism (Feign Death) that they can roam freely better than almost any other class.  They have a total security that is much more effective than invisibilty (or sneak/hide).<P>Don't close the damage gap with Rogues -- it isn't a needed improvement to Monks (and I don't think the other Monk ideas should be ignored btw).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The fact that I have to kill 5 mobs for ever 4 a human does doesn't matter somehow because eventually I'll be level 60 too?  6% is the number.. at the most.. it's really more like 4%.. that's how much more AC an Iksar monk has than a human.  That is radical?  Against Vellious mobs who seem to hit for max regardless?<P>2000 hitpoints... Regen?  LOL.  Take my regen away, that's how much it means to a monk.  A necro, yes, it's good.  A monk?  I can bandage to 75% post 50, and mend the other 25%.  Know what that means?  Whether human or lizard, monks are full health at roughly the same time (around 6 minutes).<P>Vladin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would like to say a few things about this discussion. <P>Resist Armor: Monks need a whole lot more resist gear or even more resists added to current gear. Fact is, a monk cannot participate in a guild bash well simply because he is owned by any class that can cast a spell. PVP may not be important to you guys at Verant, but keep in mind that if we are easily beaten in PVP, then we are very vulnerable in PVM as well especially considering the high agro we carry.<P>Celestial Fists: Make the buff stackable. Why should the Monk's Epic Weapon be the only one that the effect is useless at the level we attain the ability to gain the Epic Weapon?<P>Quest for Celestial Fists: I hear a lot of human monks saying that the quest is too easy, the robe should not be attainable through killing the quest npcs, that Iksar can gain faction in order to do the quest in Freeport and Qeynos. First of all, the quest is not too easy, the spawns are very rare and have extremely long spawn times. Second of all, some Iksar don't want to have faction in Freeport or Qeynos and would rather get their guild together for killing the quest npc instead of doing the quests for the ROTLC. If you really want to make the quest fair, you should include an item into the the quest that requires that Human Monks have to do the shackle quests in Cabilis. Why should Iksar have to do the Human quest and Humans not have to do Iksar quests? The point being, why should Iksar have to be subject to acquiring faction for their epic and Human Monks not have the same problem? Either that, or input a ROTLC quest initiated and completable in FP as well using shackles instead of headband and sashes.<P>Monk Damage: We are supposed to be Kings of Melee! Make it so that this statement is true. Increase our chances of hitting an increase the amount of damage we can do. Unbind our melee special attacks.<P>Discipline Fearless: This discipline is a joke! What is the point of it being it lasts a shorter amount of time than a recast of the fear spell. By the time you realize that you need to hit this discipline, the spell is already cast, and when you do hit it, you lose the ability to use another discipline. If you use this in PVP then when the fear spell dont hit, they wait 5 seconds and recast and off you go running in LD status. Make this discipline last something like 2 min or even 5 min like the resist discipline.<P>Monk Defense: If you don't increase the damage of the monk the definately increase the defense skills. Monks are known for being able to turn aside a blow or deflect the blow for less damage. Why is this not true in EQ. Make it so that Monks get hit less just for being a monk. AC should have nothing to do with this. As a matter of fact, totally naked, we should not be able to get hit very much at all. I suppose this has something to do with coding, but if you can design a rogue duck out of combat skill, then you should be able to up our percentages of dodging, riposte and the other defensive skills. Fact is, on the defense skills, Monk levels should be MUCH higher than any other class.<P>Human vs Iksar: On this matter I think that the humans are definately lacking in some very needed skills. However, if you give the AC and Serpent Sight to Humans, the make our fist delay the same as the human fist delay and allow us to wear plate! I mean, do you realize how hard it is to find some nice low weight bracers for an Iksar to wear outside of the shackle quests? Sure there are some out there but they sell for 10k each or more. And why not have some that Iksar can wear that have 10ac. It is easy for a human to get some very nice bracers but for Iksar it is much more complicated. Also, add more stats to the quest shackles that the iksar have. The human sashes and headbands are loaded with stats, where the first shackle is the shackle of bronze that has stats. I believe that this is the 5th shackle! Sure, Iksar can wear the sashes and headbands, but only if you go through the PAIN of getting faction in Freeport and Qeynos.<P>Feign Death: Fix it where if FD successfully hits, then the mobs quit hitting you. And let the mobs be cleared of Agro after a certain amount of time. And STOP the warping. The other day I was FD and the mob was followed by a friend for a long ways off and he said coast was clear. I stand out of FD and BLAMMO the mob was INSTANTLY, not even running to me but instantly, on my butt and I die!! How is it that mobs can warp and we cant?? Totally not fair! And I'm not even getting into the many, many great reasons already submitted as to why FD sucks now!<P>I LOVE the Monk Class and it is probably the funnest class I've played and I've played most of them. But to sum it up:<P>Monks need better resists.<BR>Monk Epic is hard enough as it is, please do not change any part of it unless you make it so Iksar can do it without having to gain faction in Freeport and Qeynos.<BR>Monk Disciplines need to be seriously looked at for their actual use within the game as well as PVP.<BR>Monks need either more damage output or much improved defense skills, personally I vote for defense.<BR>If you give Human Monks adds, then also give the Iksar Monks adds where the Human is better. IE Faction, Plate Wearability, Hand to Hand.<BR>Add Stats to the Iksar Shackles.<BR>Most Importantly though is fixing Feign Death.<P>Please, Please do SOMETHING about fixing Monks at the upper levels!<P>Jaykeven =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>     well i would like to share what i think, now im only a 40 monk so plz dont flame me saying blah blah you dont represent the monk community blah blah.  Because you are right, i dont know much about 50+ monks, but I DO know about pre-40 monks and this is what I have noticed could be done to improve monks.  <BR>    First Ill start with the weight.  I think this is an excellent part of being a monk, it adds character to the class, plus it makes sense.  However this does have one negative effect on the class.  In the mid levels monks are terribly poor.  unlike other classes that at this point that can afford great weapons, monks are stuck with there fists and maybe an essence of dol and a sarnak enforcer.<BR>     I think the best solution for this is to add more monk quests that can be soloed, and enhance the items that can be currently quested (ie treant fists and headbans).  Monks have a definate kind of clan thing going, so i think this only makes sense.<BR>     Now these items that can be quested should primarliy be gloves that are similar to the epic, but lower in quality.  THe epic should be the ultimate monk weapon.  THe treant fists could be one of the first in the line.  Turning the fists into weapon that is about equally as good as a set of fighting batons and has some effect with would be of much less value in later levels, cure poison otr something like that.  THen around lvl 30 there should be another one, that makes the fists somehting like 10/20 with an effect of summon bandages, or an AC buff, etc.  THen the final step would of course be the third, and final step, (btw, make the effects stack with everything else, otherwise the effect is just plain pointless).  But of course by lvl 60 even the epic isnt so hot, and because of this i think that monks should recieve a dmg bonus on there offhand when using hand to hand, starting in the 40's by the time you were high 50's you would be doing a fair amount of dmg more.<BR>    The monk headbands also need to be considered.  WHen the game was launched these items were likley excellent items to obtain so easily.  Now they fall under the PoS catergory, tehre only purpose is for the ROTLC.  The stats, especially the AC and HP need to be enhanced.<BR>    Monks also have a problem looking not looking incredibly gay.  The muscle shirt is plain silly and gets old quick, they make the dresses look good.  And the sand-dune hat comlete with lame-spike-on-top is just plain stupid.  In my opinion this probnlems solution is for the headbands to have a visual, that would be very kewl, perhaps the sashes as well.  And the crescent and shiverback to be unique lookin as well.<BR>     Frankly FD after 35 positivley confuses me.  If something thinks im dead and leaves the room, and i stand up how the hell are they gonna know im not dead?  6th sense?  and if that is the answer why did FD trick them in the first place?  I understand you dont want to make FD TOO good, but plz . . . u absolutley butchered it with that one.<BR>    Now, one other topic is the idea of interupting caster mobs.  Well one idea would be to give them realistic channeling skill, but something tells me that isnt going to happen.  Now the idea of making FK have a chance of stun is OK, and making a skill that has a chance of interupting is OK.  But these would be too good if they always worked, and too bad if there was only a chance.  When you need an interupt, you NEED an interupt.  My idea for this is in the version of a trade skill.  Monks are the masters of the martial arts, and what would the martial arts be without nifty throwing items?  I mean ninjas always escape trouble with those smoke grenades etc.  I propose that monks should have the option of learning this skill to create items that will benifit them solo as well as grouped.  Items that can be thrown and cause a variety of effects.  Explosives that stun, nets that snare or root, smoke bombs that blind, and even items that do AoE dmg, as well as the classic DD type of thrown dmg (ie shurikens).  Now the advantage to this is that the monk will only have a limited supply of these items, so even if they are good, he will need to use them sparingly or else he will need to return to a city to create more.  The only way i see this to work properly is that ONLY the monk who created the item can use it.  Perhaps a new kind of quiver should be created that is more of a bag that can be used so the monk has easy access to the items. <BR>   One other thing that confuses me, is, how come I can punch with my blunt fist for 40dmg a pop, but when i throw an aerodynamic peice of sharp metal, I do 2 or 3?   I think throwing as well as archery should be enhanced, at this point, melee (the non-mana-users) stand toe-to-toe in order to do dmg, while the casters (the mana users) stand in the background in order to do dmg.  Why shouldnt the melee be able to stand in the back and do significant dmg?  I highly doubt this would unblalance any classes dmg, because as i stated earlier, thrown items come in very limited quantities. <BR>   Anyway i think this would be a fun way to fix our problems.  Please consider it, and add your own recomendations.   Thanks for your time. <BR>    <BR>Vodalus Corpze<BR>Monk of Tallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A note on how monks look. I think the simplicity design is cool for monks. How about making a very minor change for upper level quest items.

Heres my concerns/wants:<P>     Please no more robes, doing a flying kick in a robe would give you a nice face on the floor effect, even if it were plaited(sp?) at the bottom.  Maybe add some newer outfits like KungFu uniforms(what Mel Gibson called "pajamas" in Lethal Weapon 4), and upgrade our looks a bit.<P>     Also allow quests to add skills/abilities so we are not all just the exact same.  This wouldn't give us any additional or better attacks, just change up the animations a bit.<BR>Look at our gear, and lower the weight on many of the pieces.<P>     Buff instill doubt, it seems to be linked to kick...maybe switch it over to our overall attack value so we are presenting the "total package" of our potential fury.<BR>  <BR>     I know many of these have probably already been mentioned, so forgive me for repeating any of these.<BR>Thanks,<BR>me</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I suspect this will fall on deaf ears, but it was the point of my Feign comment way back on the second page as well, and is a major issue for me...<P>Could you please avoid arbitrarily adding/changing abilities midstream?  I'm constantly seeing what appear to be very hacky fixes by making something suddenly behave different when they reach level X.  This sort of causeless change partway through the game is just poor and sloppy design, it's never been considered a viable method of design by any team I've ever seen (and with justification) yet it starting to be the primary way of "balancing" the game in EQ these days.<P>Give a new skill with an ability or change an existing skill if possible, but things like "dragon punch stuns when you reach level 55" is just a very poor way of going about things... at the very least it makes the game even more reliant on spoiler sites than it already is, as there's never any in-game indication of this sort of change unless the person tries it.  Feign suddenly changing behavior when the enemy is 32 or higher is just as poor -- Pick one or the other, don't pick an arbitrary level to change it at halfway through.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I was talking with a friend in-game earlier and he brought into specific relief our biggest problem.  I said my favorite group is a monk, a cleric, and an enchanter.  You can fight caster and melee mobs alike with ease with this combination and monks can help make sure you're only fighting one at a time.<P>He came back with this:  That's a good idea, but you could do the same thing with a cleric, an enchanter, and a (insert any other melee here).  He also said that the cleric would much prefer it if you used a warrior/sk/paladin instead of a monk.  His thinking is that a warrior does just as much damage as us, plus they All have a lot more HP and AC (it's sad that my 34th cleric can buff himself to higher HP and AC than my 39th monk has), so the cleric can make his heals much more mana-efficient so he can nuke/stun more.  SK's and pally's also have spells to help out.  As for the feign pulling, a good enchanter can make feign pulling pointless by keeping a second or third mob mezzed during the fight.<P>This really hit home how pointless monks can be at higher levels.  If you can do the same job more efficiently with the same amount of people, where is the place for a monk?  Surely you can see why we are upset as a community.  You've made this game run purely on good items and then made it so monks can't use those items.<P>You're now saying that you want to hear from us to make it better, but you:<P>1.  Shoot down any ideas we have to minorly increase our damage output or minorly decrease the amount of damage we take.<BR>2.  Take ideas that 99% of all monks consider worthless and say you'll look into them.  (A critical hit on a thrown shuriken?  Most monks I know don't even use them for pulling because of their short range.  By the time you've reached 60 range, either the mob is already aggro'd on you or you can take 2 more steps and hit him.  Plus, at 0.5 stones per stack, they're too heavy to carry enough for long pulling sessions anyway.  If you're going to range-attack pull, get a warrior with a 100 range bow and 150 range arrows to pull from across the zone.)<BR>3.  (and most importantly)  Say you don't know what monks need, but you're the one deciding what suggestions to send to the development team.  We're all VERY frightened at this prospect.<P>Obviously, when the biggest things to come out of the enchanter discussion are "I would like to see another illusion to make me look like a couch" and we're talking about losing our identity as a class, something is rotten in the state of Denmark.  It appears you've taken us lightly for months, and this seems to just be lip-service at fixing the problems we've discovered after 100's of hours of playtime each.<P>There are a lot of good ideas in these boards.  Please go back and read them again.  Or better yet, have someone on the VI staff who's played a monk to higher than level 10 come take a look and see what he/she thinks.<P>You've made the statement that you don't want to see the classes homogenized.  But clearly, the only reason to play a monk (and I do and I love my monk) is for RP reasons or just personal choice.  When there's no niche for a class, there's no point to have that class.  As it stands, it's become where we're tanks that can't take a hit.  We need something to redefine us.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Posting this again.<P>Although around HALF of the posts over 3 threads refer to this as the post they are backing, you answered only a few questions from it. <P>As mentioned, alot of work and many hours where spent compiling it on our own boards for your benefit. <P>_________________<P>This post has been compiled from a very large thread from Zadkiel Hopeseeker's Monkly-Business website. The majority of this post was originally written by Kaiele Katarn, of the Innoruuk Server. <P>The main issue that Monks currently face is dealing damage in the end game. Prior to Kunark, and the changes in the melee skill caps, we were ahead of all other classes in dealing melee damage with the exception of a backstabbing rogue (which is as it should be). <P>Since our damage was based on our higher skill caps, and those skill caps were raised for all other melee classes with the Kunark expansion, the gap has closed dramatically. Damage dealing is the only potential a monk adds to a group, especially due to changes in the way the Feign Death skill works, and mobs' reactions to Feign Death. <P>Currently, a monk offers very little to a group due to the changes in damage. A warrior has higher hitpoints, higher AC, and higher magic resistance -- and thanks to the loss of a skill cap advantage for monks and new, extremely high ratio Velious and Kunark weapons for warriors, monks no longer have a clear advantage in dealing damage over a warrior. <P>Because the skill caps cannot be raised for monks to re-establish damage potential from that side due to programming issues, we would like to propose the following changes for the monk class.<P>DAMAGE INCREASE<P>1) Some type of upgrade to damage output.<BR>Rogues are incredibly powerful when they are behind a mob. Warriors are incredible tanks. Monk damage -- either with an "uber" staff or with epic fists -- should be halfway between a rogue's potential when the rogue is behind a mob using a Ragebringer and a warrior who is attacking with his/her best weapons. Keep in mind 10/16 and 13/20 weapons for warriors when rebalancing our damage. There are many ways to tune this damage, but PLEASE do not resort to another UBER-rare staff that will only balance the 1% of the monk population lucky enough to get one of these drops.<P>2) Raise fist damage post-50 for those without epics.<BR>While the delay continues to drop, the damage never increases once a monk hits level 50. Very few monks use fists anymore, but this would make the RP'ers and casual players a tad more viable near the end-game, if they ever get there. <P>3a) Encourage usage and training of lesser monk special attacks.<BR>Either allow us to use one type of strike and one type of kick at the same time by unhooking the special attack re-use timers post-50, or give the possibility of attack "strings". (This is the preferred solution, but would be harder to implement.) If a monk successfully uses Flying Kick on an enemy -- connects for damage -- then give a chance (based on Double Attack skill, preferably) for the monk to automatically use Dragon Punch/Tail Rake. If Dragon Punch/Tail Rake connects for damage, give a slightly lesser chance of doing an Eagle Strike. This is not only an interesting solution, it would make raising all of the monk special attack skills more important. This would be a post-50 enchancement, or when a monk reaches 200 skill in Flying Kick.<P>--- If this is technically not reasonable from a coding standpoint, then a secondary option would be: <P>3b) Minimum damage on Flying Kick.<BR>It won't make a huge difference in our damage output, but it will at least make us FEEL better. There is nothing worse than doing a flying kick for 3 damage as a post-50 monk. Even making this minimum damage cap post-50 only would be an improvement, and would not unbalance the pre-50 game where monks did have an advantage.<P>Damage Increase Suggestions:<P>To recap, a level 50's fist is a 14/30 weapon, which reduces (in delay only) to 14/26 at level 60. One suggestion is to have the damage increase (as it does for the rest of the levels) post 50 as well, so that a Monks fist at 60 is 16/26.<P>One of the best suggestions that has come from the many Monks is to have the main hand damage bonus applied to the off hand.<P>This is becasue Monks are the masters of Duel-Wield. We get it as a level 1 skill, and gain 7 points per level, capping faster and higher than any other class. This indicates a natural affinity for the monk to use his off-hand, a kind of natural/trained ambidexterity.<P>Allowing us to strike just as hard with the off-hand as the primary will solve the damage-dealing problem and bring us up to the correct damage level of being between warriors and rogues.<P>If this change is made, you will need to remove MNK as a class capable of using the moss-covered twig, a weapon changed to be off-hand only because of the large amount of damage it does when a damage bonus is applied.<P>Other suggestions on ways to increase damage include having a minimum damage of level/2 for special attacks such as Flying Kick, or add some kind of level damage bonus to the special attacks, but the off hand damage bonus is the most favoured solution.<P>4) Improve Feign Death.<BR>Leave it as it currently functions in all but two areas -- If the monk is not removed from the mob's haste list and does not get a "has fallen to the ground" message, give the monk an automatic "Evade"-type effect. In other words, allow a monk to sacrifice a couple of combat rounds to lower him- or herself on the hate list. This would DRAMATICALLY increase monk survival rates on uber-mobs, when we're causing intense aggro with epic fists or other high end weapons. It also provides a check to ensure that monk damage is not overly high, if Verant is still worried about that. Finally, since this is linked to a SKILL, it still has a chance to fail, just like a rogue's evade skill. Also, fix the "no failure message, but the mob just keeps beating on me after the eighteenth feign attempt in a row" problem that I and many other monks have encountered in the post-50 world, especially while grouped in Velious.<P>One possible suggestion was to have something like "%T has seen through your ruse" when a Mob attacks after a succesful feign, simalar to the fact that Rogues know when they have sneaked succesfully, and another for resisted Spells not breaking Feign.<P>5) Fix the Celestial Fist effect.<BR>Celestial Tranquility is a great effect on our epic, but it stacks with almost NOTHING. Most monks rarely solo post-50, and most common group buffs will keep the effect from working. (Call of Earth, enchanter haste spells, most bard songs, Speed of the Shissar, etc.) At least alter it so that even if the haste is not usable due to other, better buffs then the additional effects -- the extra +AC and +ATK -- will stack anyway, similar to the way the Robe of the Whistling Fists worked. It's pretty bad when a well-meaning ranger tosses me Call of Earth and costs me 54ATK and 12AC. The ranger buff especially does not make sense because Call of Earth is NOT a Haste Buff, and the Celestial Tranquility Effect will indeed stack with the upgrade, Strength of Earth.<P>Also the Celestial Fists wearers, felt that a graphic for the hands would be better than the hand wraps.<P>6) Increase Warrior, Paladin, and ShadowKnight taunting skills.<BR>Yes, I know this isn't an enhancement to MONKS, but it would DEFINITELY help us out. WE ARE NOT TANKS. Unfortunately, it's very hard to taunt off of us due to our extreme aggro, ESPECIALLY with our low-damage, low-delay epic fists. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE implement this one change if you don't make any other!!<P>7) At least consider spreading the weight limit increase out over the post-50 levels.<BR>Few monks will make 55. Even fewer will make 60. Therefore, weight increases at those two points are not terribly useful. A 2lb increase every other level (i.e., 52, 54, 56, etc) would result in a weight limit of 24 at 60. A 1lb increase every post-50 level would be another way to implement the changes, and would also result in a weight limit of 24 at level 60. If these are "too much" of a weight increase (the current max weight limit at 60 is 22lbs, from four-pound increases at 55 and 60) then skip levels 55 and 60, when we get our passive enhancements of +1 HP per tick while feigned.<P>The following are additional information gathered from other Monks posts, covering Skills, Disciplines, Armour and Quests.<P>SKILLS<P>Mend.<BR>Perhaps Mend at a skill of 201+ can have a small chance of curing disease/poison. The increase chance to cure will rise as the skill goes above 201+.<P>Skill Caps.<BR>Kick caps at 250. So why does Flying kick, eagle strike, and dragon punch all cap at 230?<P>Also, it was recently announced that they upped the caps for the Hand to Hand skill to equal 1hb/2hb, but all that was raised was the 60 cap, the 50 cap is still only 225 compared with 1hb/2hb cap of 240, so the 50 cap needs to be increased to 240 as well.<P>Higher Dodge, Riposte & Block.<BR>This is a concern for high level Monks in regards to the Big Game Hunts. <P>With higher skills in these areas, this would give Monks a unique way to tank better - Plate classes absorb damage with their higher hps, Rogues use stealth (evade) to not get hit, and monks just flat out use speed (block/dodge/riposte) to make the mob miss them. <P>Either increase the 3 skills from there current caps of 225/230 to 252, or have higher percentage chances of working (if that is not taken into consideration with a higher skill)<P>DISCIPLINES<P>Thunderkick<BR>This needs to be worked on, as currently it is being reported that 24 damage comes up the majority of the time. Possible suggestions include it becoming an innate or a timed discipline where every kick within the disciplines duration can be a thunderkick, {b} the minimum damage on TK to be 1 to 1.5 * level, (so a 60th level Monk will not kick for less than 60-90 damage with it), {c} add a short stun to Thunderkick, or {d} make TK a special attack after flying kick, gained at 50+th level or so.<P>These suggestions assume that the damage is not based from the FK damage table, and flying kick is not improved in any of the above afore mentioned ways.<P>We would like all the disciplines to receive an increase in length, and looking at the new hybrid disciplines, no one else has every discipline last for short periods of time.<P>ARMOUR<P>Monk armour needs some natural AC progression. It would be nice to see all cresent pieces (obtainable at around level 30) being 1 point more AC then cured silk (obtained at level 15) shiverback (obtained at 46+) being 1-2 AC greater than cresent, and Velious quest armour (obtained at level 50+) being 1-2 greater than shiverback. Each piece should have a higher AC than the same piece of the previous type. <P>Also, why does our equipment seem to have less (overall) in stats, resists, and clickable effects then other melee classes?<P>Leggings<BR>Cured - AC5<BR>Crescent - AC3 +stats +svs<BR>Shiver - AC5 +stats +svs<BR>Velious - AC6 +stats + svs +hp +Effect<BR>Black Panther - AC8 +stats<BR>Other - Gators AC 7 +stats, +hp<P>Arms<BR>Cured - AC4<BR>Crescent - AC3 +stats +hp <BR>Shiver - AC5 +stats<BR>Velious - AC7 +stats, svs, hps <BR>Black Panther - AC7 +stats, svs<BR>Other - Azures AC 12<P>Bracer<BR>Cured AC3<BR>Crescent - NONE<BR>Shiver - AC4 +stats, +svs <BR>Velious - AC6 +stats, +svs, +effect <BR>Black Panther AC6 +stats, +hp <BR>Other - Vox AC 7<P>Gloves<BR>Cured - AC4<BR>Crescent - AC3 +stats +svs<BR>Shiver - AC5 +stats, +effect, +svs<BR>Velious - AC10 +svs, +stats, +hps<BR>Black Panther - AC7 +stats <BR>Other - Treants AC 8 <P>This table refers to a selection of our armour, and the other column is what a normal 35th to 40th level Human Monk currently wears. As noted, these MONK ONLY pieces do not have any kind of progression AC wise, which ultimately is one of the main things ppl look for. <P>As shown, Crescent has a lower AC than Cured, Blank Panther armour, which is Tailored (admittedly at high skill) is mostly better than Velious armour. <P>If Shiverback AC was raised to the AC level of the Black Panther armour, and the Velious armour AC rasied to that beyond Black Panther, I think that the vast majority of Monks would be very pleased. You will NOT increase a Monks AC, only make Monks want to wear their own armour.<P>To clarify, NOT ONE MONK is asking for more AC on pieces than we are already wearing, simply the AC of Monk only armour to be brought in line. If Velious sleeves had an AC of 10, they would be worn by many Monks over the Azure Sleeves they have worn for the past 30+ levels.<P>MONK QUESTS<P>Treant Fists.<BR>Make them have a slight effect (whether attack raised by 1 to 10, a small self only heal or even an effect like summoning bandages), or alter the stats enough to make the Monks of that level want to do the (35hr average long) quest, rather than the all to easy Gem Inlaid Guantlets, which provides a very simalar quest result in a fraction of the time.<P>The Collar of Neshika.<BR>The Collar itself is to heavy, and the weight needs to be greatly reduced from 1.5, perhaps down to 0.2, and adding one AC, would make the quest worth completing (and wearing over a Undead Collar)<P>Iksar Quests<BR>I belive their final quest (whistling Fist?) is still unfinished, and needs to be looked into.<P>This post does not cover everything, and as mentioned is compiled from many to help you decide what we think is required. Monks upto level 50, we believe are balanced, and it really is the end game (50 to 60th) that things need to be addressed.<P>Bodi Kibadachi, Bristlebane<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One thing that seems to have been overlooked in this (extremely) long thread, is how Instill Doubt works.<P>As things are now, ID can be activated if a special hasn't recycled yet, but will automatically fail.  IMO, this should either be changed so that ID is disabled until the special recycles (bind it to the special fully) or allow it to work anyway (unbind it from the special fully).  This limbo-like middle ground is annoying, and often confusing to monks who have just gotten the skill.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>On a related note, EVERY monk special from level 5 on is considered a magical attack for purposes of hitting invulnerable mobs (willowisps, ghouls, etc), yet ID at level 18 isn't considered a magical attack, even though it uses a kick that looks like a cross between a round kick and a flying kick.  Magical monk shoes are hard to come by; Barring stuff that only becomes available a MINIMUM of 10 to 12 levels after the skill is gained, the only real choices are to buy kobold hide boots (heavy) or wolf fur slippers (expensive).  If all of our other specials are magical, why not make it so we can use ID without magical footwear?  I mean, the best looking shoes I've been able to get with my level 20 monk are cured silk; But while he can barely be hit by a VERY green willowisp, and can rather effortlessly kill one, he somehow can't scare one away?   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/confused.gif"><P>Finally, ID fails regularly, to a ridiculous extent; Combined with the fact that it goes up in level VERY slowly, it's almost useless.  And even when it does work, the only things I've scared off were newbie zone mobs, who came running back within five seconds.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif"><P>Overall, the skill is extremely broken; Everybody practices it, almost nobody uses it, and the few times it might save the monk or his/her group, it always fails...   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>So the best we can hope for is some minor increase in flying kick and/or thunder kick damage? Well let me inform you that FK is only about 10% of the total damage output while main hand do about 60% of it and off hand 30%.<BR>Well lets say that a damage bonus of 10 is added to each flying kick, that would increase average FK from 50 to 60. An increase of 20%, thats REALLY cool since it will increase the total damage output with a whopping 2%!!<P>The problem with flying kick is that its a lvl 30 skill that doesnt get any more powerful than it is at lvl 30. So while it used to be great pre-kunark when Ykesha was about the best weapon in the game and monks used 14/36 fists at lvl 50, it is not so impressive any longer.<P>Of course it shouldnt be as powerful as backstab, but it should increase in power in a similar way.<BR>It is so weak now that a minor increase would hardly do anything. Flying kick could be enhanced a lot without overpowering monks. You could add a damage bonus of 20 AND double attack to flying kick and it still wouldnt increase our damage output by 10%!<P>/Stora  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Re: Comments on suggested changes to ROTLC/ROTWF/EPIC.<P>Personally I  fully agree with the use of containers to limit multiquesting in the, (THOUGH MAKE THEM WEIGHT 0.0!!!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/redface.gif">) ).  However,  with reguards to making the sash/headbands nodrop, this I disagree with.<P>The ROTLC is NOT just the ROTLC.  It is a  required precursor quest for the ROTWF and Monk Epic.  Making the headbands/sashes nodrop would NECESSITATE that Iksar monks fix faction (Real Life days of faction work as a precursor to one of the longest camping quests in the game (raster)) with both human monk guilds in order to Complete their ROTLC.  This not only makes NO sense from an RP standpoint, but there's them 3 PVP servers to consider too.<P>So, Basically there's 3 genuinely acceptable options at this point.  1 being the most reasonable IMHO.<P>1) status quo.  Not ideal, but a human only quest designed pre-kunark was added as a pre-cursor to quests that were not designed as human only (ie: the epic quest).<BR>2) Different lead in to the ROTLC quest for Iksars instead of the sashs/headbands.  (Keep in mind that the shackles are ***considerably*** more difficult quests than the sashes/headbands though, and are actually useful.  Would need to be new...).<BR>3) Different token for Iksars in the ROTWF/EPIC quests to circumvent this.<P>Personally I think the comments on sash/headbands are motivated by some of the petty race comparison spite that has infected this thread, to the dismay of many Monks both human and iksar.  While having them as tradable or collecting the items and bribing someone to hand them in isn't perfect, I sincerely hope forcing people to spend days running about killing orc pawns and stuff at L50 is a goal that proves avoidable in this balance thread.<P>Now, as for Monk BALANCE issues,  I heartily endorse the post taken from Monkly-business,  as it is a succinct explanation of the issues that are currently problematic to monks in  gameplay.<P>Lythe<P>L53 Monk.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Am I the only person that cares about the original monk vision?<P>I remember back before kunark.. the greatest thing us monks had was the ability to use our fists instead of worrying about buying a big, expensive weapon.. i always thought the weight restriction was to keep us from amassing a fortune when we didnt have to buy gear.<P>We need an increase in h2h.. i thought we were supposed to shun weapons and armor.. but now after level 30 you have to have weapons/armor because we are useless without..<P>make the h2h damage match up with the weapons we can get..

RFS and SoS are very out of my reach right now.. listen to the way im talking.. im dependant on weapons lol..<P>are monks supposed to be dependant on weapons now? I thought originally that the point of being a monk was to NOT be dependant on weapons</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>the "chi" idea is another very good one that matches the "vision" of monks.<P>I think some should have a mana-to-effect type casting, where you start casting and your mana is drained to support the effect.  Call these spells upkeep spells for the sake of discussion.<P>Others should have a one time cast.<P>These spells should be simple, and in line with what a monk is.<P>Ideas include:<P>Haste (hopefully stackable with weapons)--this is an upkeep spell.<P>Mend other (uses mend)--one time cast<P>Spirit walk (makes you invisible)--upkeep spell<P>SoW type spell (usable in doors)--upkeep<P>An aggro clearing spell that combines FD with a permanent mem blur effect (no re-aggro when you stand)--one time cast.<P>The list goes on and on.  The spells would be expensive, and monks should get no meditate ability.  They should be simple, and augment, but not change.  <P>Monks should not become buffers of others with these spells... they should all be for self-buffing, and self augmentation.  The mend other spell would be the exception, and it should be some cost-inneficent that it is rarely used in that fassion (few monks would actually mend someone else anyway imho.<P>Pers</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If you give humans the same advantages as Iksar give them the same disadvantages.  For example, the quest which gives them an AC bonus also makes them KoS everywhere except ONE city.  The quest which gives them serpent sight effectively removes 20% of their experience permanently and gives them a 20% penalty on all future earned experience.<P>If they are not willing to take the bad with the good they they don't want balance -- they want Christmas presents.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Actually DnT,<P>I shouldn't have flamed you, and for that I appologize to you personally.  You have a right to express your opinion without being blasted.<P>I understand that with Iksar regen, I can heal the final 25% of my hitpoints twice as fast as a human monk.  As a soloist, *monks* generally do not wait until full health to go and fight.  They bandage to half, mend to 75%, find a nice outdoor zone with plenty of low blues, and they take them down with about 1.5 - 2 bubbles to spare.  To take it further, we instill doubt once or twice during the fight (quite often), and sometimes end the fight with 2.5 - 3 bubbles to spare.  Rinse and repeat.  No monk, human or otherwise, when soloing, should have more than about 6 minutes of downtime.  In group situations, the rate of mobs killed is subject to the groups capabilities.  No apparent benefits to grouping as an Iksar *particularly* with the recent experience changes.<P>Again, appologies for the flame.  <P>Vladin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hmmm alot of examples here would redefine the entire monk class and require ALOT of development hours for verant....not to mention me quitting the game entierly in disgust.<P>They wanted tweaks...not suggestions about how we could use chi skills, hp meditations and how we need to be reworked into best use hands again etc etc etc <BR>As much as i would like to never use weapons i doubt they will backflip on monk evolvement now.<P>Whats wrong with monks that realisticaly can be adjusted?<BR>Not enough damage to be a damage class.<BR>No way of escaping aggro, wich makes us a liability.<BR>Epic making us non group friendly.<BR>Epic causing insane aggro while not beeign good enough for offhand usage.<P>My personal suggestion how to help the situation is:<BR>*Add a minimum damage to flying kick that equals lvl of the monk.<BR>*Add a double flying kick at 55 similar to the rogues double backstab.<BR>*Make FD if not completely dropping us from aggro lower us on the list, this would be just as effective to make FD a non secure "get out of jail free" card as the current state and stop FD pulling but make us able to controll our aggro.<BR>*rework epic to item haste/ac/atk effect to make us able to take full effect of it in groups and change it from 9/16 to 18/25(or so) so we can use it in both hands AND cause less aggro(this is more in line with how our normal fists work too).<P><BR>Read bodhis post...its very thought out and if you think we want alot then it is cause we instead of getting more and more balanced like the other classes have been we havent gotten any attention at all.<P>Other than that just try to balance the human monk vs iksar monk situation sicne its currently a bit off.<P>Aelorn *hopes his 57 monk will be once again a viable class*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 8 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053593&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053593&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
