</FONT><HR>VI, we have REPEATEDLY told you there is a problem on some servers with this epic mob needed to complete druid epic quest. With nearly every cleric or rogue over 50 wielding their epics, why do you absolutly REFUSE to even look at this issue? we have ranted until most have just given up totally on our "Class defining" weapon, and i have not seen ONE single comment on faydedar, or if this problem is even being looked into. i have 400 hours to date sitting at those spires, no one can tell me i shouldnt see that mob spawned SOMETIMES within 400 hours. this is not an epic quest it is an epic CAMP, that needs to be looked at and revised. <P>       Im gonna watch this post and hopefully get enough replies from other druids (one post on this issue had 200+ replies, NO BLUE NAME COMMENT) and MAYBE, just MAYBE someone in Verant will get down from their high horse and make a simple statement to their customers on this PROBLEM.<P>Wiladan<BR>Fed up at 400 hours on "Fay Watch"<BR>Sayryn server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

This ranger was on a seperate account and stayed logged in 24/7 for for several weeks before feydedar spawned. <P>The problem is that the zone gets reset all the time due to problems with the boat.

</FONT><HR>Absor, my guild leader is a druid and has been trying to get Faydedar for quite a while, we just took him down in fact.  But this is with him having a second computer on which he had a level 1 character camped at the spires everyday for at least 5 a day ( 12 hours on weekends).  Faydedar finally spawned after 6 weeks.  Basically we got one spawn for 300 hours.  That might be what you want for Fay, but it seems a little rare.  Especially since you have to be ready to drop everything and engage him before he despawns.<P>Rhyse</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This dragon is a joke.  He takes forever to spawn and on the off chance that he will spawn he despawns all the time. My guild found him up(after a level 1 camped at the spires for a week) and got together and got out there. We buffed up and preceeded to pull Faydedar, well apparently he didnt like that and commited suicide.  Is this part of the Vision because I find it rather unfair to Druids and even post 53 paladins trying to get epic items.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Why isn't faydedar a triggered spawn ? I mean make the mob that drop the pod of water harder than the actual Faydedar but please remove the timesink, is just unfair considering the fact that the Druid FA quest has already loads of timesinks (porting from one side to the other of the world, forage very rare stuff, camping a bunch of different greenies corrupted mobs ... a lol. Actually there are several options that could be taken here:<P>1. Increase Faydedar spawn rate (i doubt this would be possible, he drops old world dragoon loot and i agree we don't want those items to enter the norrath too frequently)<BR>2. Make a side mini quest to obtain an item that would allow to spawn Faydedar. This way a little time sink with some difficulties would have been added but the people that just need Faydedar will notmaind to do somethign rahter than sitting at spires with a mule for 300+ hours<BR>3. Make a a version of Faydedar triggered just without needs for a side mini quest but not droppping anything else than the pod of water.<BR>4. Add the pod of water to the drop tables of similar lvl mobs (Severillious, Dragons in Cobalt scar etc)<P>Verant alway said they discourage "camping", i am sorry here, but if you re not camping Faydedar for hours and hours there is no chance to just meet him adventuring ... you have to sit at spires 24/7 for quite sometime. After he spawned you have to hope you got friends with no life on-line 24/7 (yeah he can sapwn at 5:30AM in the morning real world time) and ready to run to kill the dragon at any time of the day within 2 hours and hope that the Iksar maser is in the good mood and is not gonna spot your mob or can ruin your party ... Sorry this do not compare to any other FA quest in game not even to the mage FA ... at least there the mage doesn't need an army thre within 1 hour to kill Quillmane when he spawns ...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hear me out on this, it's not meant to insult or support the statement you guys are making, but it is an interesting theory:<P>I think the "vision" is that the epic items don't go to everyone, it doesn't even go to those who put efforts into it. It goes to those who are fortunate or lucky enough to be somehow blessed with seeing the beast and slaying him.<P>If they made Faydedar a triggered spawn then everyone would be able to get the epic item.  What is the point of being epic or special then? Everybody in an uber guild could get one by the end of the week.  It'll just be another matter reserved only for the uber elites.<P>Afterall, fortune and fate plays a huge enough role in stories compared to actual conscious diligence.  The hero who saves the world is often blessed with some form of luck one time or another in his career.  For example, a warrior might find a magical sword, or he might escape some dreadful traps through pure luck, or meet some powerful sage who teaches him how to fight, etc.  Those things don't just happen to anyone who wanted it to happen or even had the heart to make it happen.<P>If the logic that "with enough people and resources, we should be able to do anything" holds true in this case, then the hero would never defeat the dark lord, especially in those novels where the dark lord is always stronger than the hero in some way or another. <P>Verant had proved this again and again with their once-in-a-life-time rare spawns such as Bilge or Pyzyin or Quillmane, who, while easy to kill and carrying loot that surpasses those gained by slaying monsters ten times their strength, are so rare that only a few people could ever attain those items.  Heck, some of these spawns are so rare that even with 100+ days played I have yet to see any of them.  I've never seen Bilge, never seen Quillmane, never seen Faydedar, never even seen the Guano Harvester even though I've spent alot of time in Solusek B.  <P>Don't think Verant designed those just to spite the players who want those items.  They had a purpose in mind, and for players to camp 3+ monthes in a zone and return empty handed is part of it.  You ever read about those treasure hunters who spend their entire life looking for something, but then some novice to the trade comes in and steals their lifetime of work by having the luck to discover it? Maybe somethings are simply luck, and just matter of being at the right place in the right time.  <P>I am probably wrong, but I remembered when I used to spend 20+ hours in SRO waiting for the AC to spawn, in a period of almost a week.  Thing was, even though I spent 20+ hours and haven't killed him once, some level 30ish newbie came in one day and got the AC after only 30 mins of waiting.  Yet all the same, I died one day in Permafrost and was bound exactly at the skeletal ruins in Queynos Hills.  By some grace, Pyzyin was up and I nuked her: boom, GBS and I never even really had to camp for it.<P>Is it fair? No, but then life is often unfair, and it is the element of chance that makes life exciting.  It is this element of chance that could, perhaps one day, fall upon you and grace you with its touch.  One day, an item might drop from one of the uber dragons, and somehow you might have the fortune to be the only person there to claim it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Graal, thank you for posting here in my support  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Actually the ranger was up from 12/11 to 12/22 only when I was also online.<P>Tired of thoughts that I or the druid I was sharing the camp with missed Fay when we were logged out, I started my mule online 24hours a day 7 days a week from 12/23 to 01/2  After over a week with no Faydedar spawns AT ALL (and yes I spent 2 days killing streamers and fire gators to no luck) I petitioned that the spawn was broken. I was informed that it wasn't. I asked how they knew. I was told they'd gotten no reports on errors with spawn tables for our server. (I told the guide of the other servers during this time that HAD had Fays, sometimes 2 days in a row). <P>I asked for email addy to report errors to and wrote it. I cited the thread on the druids grove board that listed all the times camped per server and the Faydedar's that spawned or didn't on each one for the same time period as my week of 24/7 with no Fay.<P>On 01/01 about 630am EST low and behold there is a server reset. 1:13am EST the next morning my mule was slain by Faydedar (while I slept, but another druid was able to get him that had tried before I started) Then within 24hours Fay spawned AGAIN and this time I got my Fay.<P>Call me crazy, but I'm convinced something about the Faydedar spawn was broken that week camp before the server reset. My mule never died in over 250 hours of straight camping.<P>As long as they can keep it from breaking like that again, or identify those times and fix it, then Faydedar is a long but doable camp. <BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My God...216 hours? 400 hours?  You have got to be joking.  You'd spend 400 hours looking for some COMPONENT to a quest?  Not even the actual item but just a component?  Are you crazy?  Have you no life?  What is wrong with you?  Cant you think of one thing better to do than to look at the exact same screen for 400 hours?  VI, please give this person their epic weapon now because that is proposterous that someone should spend that amount of time and not find this thingie, whatever it is.  If someone has to spend this long of a time looking for a component to a quest I would consider it as broken even if you meant it to be like that.  Fix the quest and give this guy his item.  He deserves it darnit.  If you sign a petition to have them give you a backpack full of these, even if they are lore, I'll sign it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif">  But then again, I'm just a newbie remember ;-)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'll tell you what I'd like to see. I'd like to see a comparison per server of how many epic weapons for each class exist. I know on Saryrn there are a lot of Cleric weapons, several ranger weapons, several of just about each weapon except Wizard and Magician, but there are only 2 druid weapons that I know of.<P>I'm all for moving the pod to Corrupted Feydedar, and making him s triggered spawn. Perhaps introduce another subqquest that ends up with, say, Corrupted Dragon Scales, maybe, and introduce a new NPC in Timorous Deep, the Water Dragon Trainer, give him the Corrupted Dragon Scales,and BAM Corrupted Feydedar spawns, and there you go. That would certainly offset the difficulties of gathering guildmates to a zone that can't be bound in, takes half an hour to get to, and requires lots of overwater travel. Anything would be better than the current system. <P>Absor, you can do all your control tests, and look at all the date you want. But you want my advice? Make a character, pick any server at random, and go camp the dragon yourself. Take the time out of your own personal life, just like you are expecting all the Druids to to, and go sit on the guy.  Then post how long you waited, and let us know the result. And spread it around some, do it on 3 or 4 different random servers.<P>Then we will be prepared to listen to your justifications about how this dragon's spawn rate is as planned.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Mistmorgue, I'm sorry, but comparing your camp of the AC to an epic mob is just ridiculous. Saying that making it a triggered spawn would make it too easy to get, is ridiculous.<P>I respect your opinion, and I agree to a point...the epic *should* be difficult to obtain. Once I get mine, I'll wield it proudly, knowing that I worked very hard to get it.<P>BUT, even if Faydedar were a triggered spawn...this epic would not be "easy" in any fashion.  We still have VS (who is camped constantly on my server) and a slew of corrupted mobs...on top of other 50+ mobs.<P>The epics should be "equally" difficult to obtain, and I'm sorry, but the druid epic is just not. I have two rangers in my guild who quested a total of about 2 weeks to get theirs, a shaman who has one step to go (quested maybe 3 weeks so far, and his final step is triggered) and two clerics who got theirs in less than a month (and I do know some clerics who've gotten it in a week or so). Honestly, I wouldn't mind the spawn time on this critter as much if I didn't see so many folks completing their quests in a month or so...I haven't even HEARD of Faydedar being killed in the last month.  And I've seen very few druids with their epics so far...<P>A ranger friend of mine claimed his epic was "tougher" to get than mine...but seriously folks, how many times is Inny up and isn't killed ASAP?  Our server has Hate raids goin on 24/7...he actually got his component FIRST Hate raid ever!<P>And you are 100% correct in saying that life isn't fair...but this is a game, and honestly, striving and hoping for my epic is beginning to ruin the fun for me.  It is NOT fun having to camp this guy, knowing full well that when he does spawn, I probably won't be able to garner the forces fast enough to kill him...<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I and several other druids have been camping Fay pretty much 24/7 since Christmas on the Innoruuk server and have yet to see a spawn.  I personally spent over 100 hours straight while on vacation waiting for him to spawn.  I too petitioned only to get the response "I haven't heard of any problems with it".<P>I'm all for the epic quests being difficult, but why can't he spawn every once in a while?  It seems several servers are seeing him time after time, yet others (like Innoruuk server) never even see him once.  Just because he spawns is NO guarantee that you can kill him.  You still have to get him to chase you over to land without dying in an area which will make it very hard to find your corpse if you die.  You still have to get 20-30 high level friends to drop what they are doing and get over to a difficult to reach zone, swim to the attack spot, buff up and kill him before he despawns.<P>I too am a developer and recognize the belief that if the data is identical on two servers it probably should work - but obviously something is causing the spawn to break on some servers while continuing to work on others.  If you are looking into it, please add Innoruuk to the list of broken servers.<P>I don't want to be handed my epic weapon without working hard on it, but I would at least appreciate the ability to do that work on it.  After all, isn't it kind of hard for Faydedar to be corrupting the land if he isn't around?<P>Selwyn Wulfgang<BR>Preserver of the 55th season<BR>Innoruuk server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What about this thought? Any time that timerous is reset it bugs fayd's spawn? This is seeming more and more like a real possibility, for you see him pop a lot more often right after server resets for maybe two or three days, then the boats are probably bugged by then and the zones need reseted more often, bugging the spawn.  Is this a logical possibility Absor if you could please check? And about the server that you last checked for Fayd on, when was timerous reset last? Check these sets of data, and you might find why druids are complaining about Fayd not spawning, because there probably is some oversight in the code that is not taking in to effect: 1 the zone crasing/being repoped for boats, and 2 Are you guys aware that once you put in the Iksar Master that he kills Fayd? Was this planned?  I sure hope not, a depop time of like 6 hours would be more realistic, trying to kill a dragon in less than 2 hours is nonsense. <P>Thank you a concerned Druid.<P><BR>PS: Yes I Have feen Fayd pop twice on my server (Xegony) But I was unable to get the people together to kill him due to the times he popped.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What I don't understand, is why do rogues and clerics get triggered spawns to finish their epics?  I mean, cleric get to turn something in to get Ragefire dragon to spawn, so why can't the druid epic be like that?  I think the difficulty of the epic quests should have been somewhat even, but they are not even close.  The cleric and rogue quests were a joke, which is why there are so many of them with epic weapons already.  How bout mages and necros?  Or druids?  There aren't many mages or necros with their FA yet, and very few druids.  Only one on my server that I know of, and a lot more that only need Faydedar to finish.  All I need is Faydedar to finish my epic quest, yet he never seems to be up, and I have a job so I cannot sit in Timorous Deep for 38 hours straight like some have done to get him.  I ain't saying to just give the epic to us, but at least make this mob not despawn anymore.  That way at least someone has a chance to get him while he is up.  <P>Aguilera Angelheart<BR>58th Dr00d and officer of Wraith<BR>Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Yes, I know he spawns.  My guild has killed him many times in the past (mostly because he used to spawn when the zone was repopped).  However, the 2 hour despawn just sucks.  I know he spawned last Friday in the wee hours of the morning and there weren't enough people to kill him.  I had a twink on the spires 24/7 from Friday 5pm until last night with no spawn.  The waiting gets extremely boring.  Epic boredom for the Epic Quest.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor no offense but whenever in the past someone from Verant has said...<P>We're 'pretty' sure that he is popping as planned<P>....then 99/100 at some point you have had to come back, finally address the problem and eventually 'fix' it.<P>I play on Mith Marr and Faydedar was killed last night.  This is the first time that he has been spotted in almost 4 weeks!  At present I am pretty certain that there is only 1 Druid epic on our server.  With this latest Fay killing there may now about to be 2 (although I am not certain that the looter of the pod of water even has the VS stone yet).<P>I know that there are a number of people on Mith Marr all waiting on Fay to complete their epic.  What this basically means it that anywhere between 2 - 10 ppl have a mule in TD waiting for Fay to spawn.  Is this really how you imagined the epic quests to turn out?  People creating mules to sit for literally hundreds of hours in a zone waiting on a uber uber rare spawn who then commits suicide 2-3 hours after spawning?<P>Please address this issue seriously.  I dont think anyone here is asking for you to make the epic 'easier' but please, please, please at least make it 'possible'.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yeah, I have my twink sitting on the spires which I log in on my 2nd machine whenever I'm home and all weekend (turn the volume up to hope I hear crunches in the night to wake me up).<P>My twink camp time now is getting close to 150 hours.  I also share the camp with 7 other druid from a variety of guilds on my server.<P>I need to take food/water to my poor ogre.  He has been hungry and thirsty for 2 or 3 days now.  That was after my last care package of 160 food and 160 water.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044816-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044816-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044816-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=044816&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=044816&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
