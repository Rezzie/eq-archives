</FONT><HR>Its sad but true ... trade skills get the short end of the stick in development time as few players do trade skills ... however few players do trade skill as it gets the short end of the stick in development time , any one see a patern here ?<P>All the trade skils require a lot of extra work on the players part , some trade skills offer a reward for that effort and some have no value above the ability to do them ... Jewlery and smithing can be profitable (Jewlery more so , Smithing less so) and if you can make backpacks tailoring can turn a profit too ... brewing and pottery can be usefull if you need the heady kiola or vials thay make but good luck trying to sell them ... bakeing , if your board or just have fun chacing things down for no gain then knock yourself out but other than that 0 value.<P>Then their is the time/cost factor ... spend time/cash mastering a skill wail your friends gain levels and make cash by selling loot ... shure now you can sell banded armor for around a plat an AC and maybe make a few plat per piece after production cost but , you can kill one critter and sell the loot for a few plat AND gain exp for the next level , getting more loot from bigger critters and being able to go more places and go more things ... <P>Im not saying i want exp. from trade skill , just the chance for my time and effort doing things other than killing monsters for exp/loot to be worth SOMETHING ... something that would make the time/cost worth the effort ... i dont even mind the smiths small profit margen , at least he has one that any charicter type can do (unlike Jewlery where you have to be an enchanter or know an enchanter or be willing to pay throu the nose for their castings on your metal) ... look at pottery , brewing , cooking , not one plat to be made unless you lucky enugh to find someone with lots of plat who is willing to indulge you (with plat gained from killing the monsters you did not).<P>And yes thay have taken a few small steps in makeing the skills more viable , raw silk / cured silk can make a few plat ... heady kiola is useful to a tailor but ask any tailot if he buys it or makes it (i mastered brewing just to make my oun) , and pottery vials ... again who buys them when it easyer to become a master potter than find one ?<P>So i hope against hope ... knowing full well that becaus the trade skills are not well flushed out (from an economic stand point) thay will not have a big draw , will not have a big player economy impact , and thus will be the last in line to be improved ... its sad but true .</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Being a master tailor (max skill) as well as master smith , brewer and potter (so far) i have an idea or two about how much cash is in tailored armor ... and yes at level 10 or 12 the 1 or 2 plat you might make on the silks or some parts of reinforced you sell to druids only might seem like good cash (untill you figure in the cost of developing the skill and time) but ... what about a charicter level 30 tailor ? you going to hunt down a HQ cat skin , smith up a few steel bonings , get a pattern and combine with a sewing kit to make a plat or 2 ? or at 30 are you going to thump that critter over their for 1-5+ plat as well as exp in far far less time ?<P>And i know more than a few master fletchrs ... their is far more cash to be made by just leveling as fast as you can than doing ANY trade skill (yes even jewlery). This i can attest to as i have spent the last 2 months trying to compeat with others leveling wail i worked the trade skills for every thing i could ... i did find a nitch that made cash , but the people i used to group with are far richer by leveling , as well as the others that i have watch clime in level wail i worked and worked at the trades ... even after selling several hundered 10 slot backpacks at 100 per im not even close to what the others i used to group with have nore am i even close to being able to go where thay can or get the higher end items thay do .<P>Now i know it is not all about what i/you can get or have , greed is not the only reward , tier is a serten amout of satisfaction in makeing things that others find usefull (and not just looting it like everyone else) ... however , it is a way to mesure sucsess in game terms ...  maybe its foolish of me but i think it would be nice if the same amount of time/work was CLOSE to the same amount of reward .</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Aren't we forgetting the personal benefit of some trade skills?  Right now the whole reason I'm working on fletching, tailoring, and baking is for personal needs.  I like being able to return to town as rarely as I need to to buy supplies, so I buy some spices, sauce, and bread so I can cook meat, and make, even if it sounds disgusting, rat sandwiches.  The fletching I use just to supply me with arrows, and tailoring is really only for armour, but I do use that skill to make myself some money, since I'm completely suited in patchwork armour.  Well the point I'm getting at is some trade skills don't always need to be used for money making, and Verant probably doesn't want it like that either.  Well thats just my 2 cents...

</FONT><HR>You are right in that the trade skills can be usefull and can make some cash ... its just that i think thay are being ignored as verant works on class balance / quests / spells / ect (all good things) ... id just like to see a little now and then for the trade skills ... i have seen one upgrade to the trade skills since i came into the game (as well as gnome only tinkering and shaman only alchemy come in) and im just postulateing on why i think this is so (one trade upgrade wail i have seen meny new spells , new quests , even new zones ) <P>And a small side point ... the bread you use to make the sandwitches has the same food value as the sandwitch itself (without paying for sause/spice) ... and muffins cost less and weight far less ... but if you like turning one kind of food into another more power to you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I have one problem with trade skills, they are expensive.  Thats the main reason i never worked on a trade skill in 50 levels with my warrior, never had the cash needed to invest into it.  <P>And now with shaman alchemy in place, and a lvl 29 shaman, I just spent 200pp making a simple potion.  The herbs are priced at 4pp for the cheapest and go up from there and require minimum 2 herbs to make a potion. Thats 8pp per try. The only other skill I can see as being just as expensive is jewelcraft<P>Some of the much more needed potions, like SoW, damage shield, shrink and gate(once we figure out the right combination-thats money wasted there on trying different expensive combinations) are much more expensive starting at like 25pp per attempt and as you know not guaranteed to succeed.<P>I personally feel that the prices on herbs used in alchemy be reduced, but thats my opinion.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I do portable trade skills to fully utilize my time, as well as role play.  What else are you going to do while medding or resting to get hps back up?  Go fishing while making fish fillets.  Or sit in Unrest, making vegetable soup for your friends who can't forage on a cold February morning while waiting for spawn or readiness.  They talk about how good it smells.  Or save the pelts you get from stupid green lions, etc. that attack you and stitch them into something sellable while you would otherwise just be wasting time.  Who would turn down a few extra plat from making fish fillets while you don't have enough mana or strength to fight anyway?  (Besides, baked food is much lighter to carry than other kinds, just ask a monk)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>True, muffins weigh the same as other baked foods and can be bought from npc merchants for cheap.  But where is a good aligned character going to buy muffins in evil aligned zones, or even in GFay where the npcs don't carry muffins? Or in dungeons?  And the reverse for evil aligned characters in good aligned zones. Hmm. They might just have to get some food from a player instead of going all the way back to a town.  And if they are smart, they will want the lightest kind.  Lizard-on-a-stick in Cazic Thule, for example, hehe.  I have seen quite a few evil dark elves buy food from players for large sums of plat in order to avoid having to interrupt themselves to go home for food.  <P>I'm not saying that you will.  I am just mentioning that SOME players do it that way.  To tell the truth, I just bake for fun and to have something productive to do while medding, and I often give away my baked goods to team members instead of summoning something for them.  <P>But I recouped my investment in learning baking a good while back(very small investment compared to other skills, especially if you start early and can forage and fish) by selling fish fillets and other items to npcs over the game years, just by doing it constantly even after almost all foods become trivial.  It doesn't take any extra time except the time to stop at a baking supplies vendor when I am passing by anyway.  And man, I hate just sitting there watching my mana bar go up hair by hair while twiddling my thumbs!<P>And that is why I think portable trade skills are a valuable part of the game.

</FONT><HR>About Alchemy being "cheap" relative to its payoff potential--<P>Do remember what a cash cow smithing used to be, until the twinkization filtered down and the availability of bronze killed the market.  I payed 25pp for my set of banded sleeves, and didn't feel at all ripped off.  Now its hard for me to sell my own homemade banded for anything more than 1 or 2pp above the "1pp per AC" that everybody wants.<P>Getting back to Alchemy, it will probably have similar competition problems.  Once more people become Shamans to make money on Alchemy, the prices will tumble.<P>Its terribly unfortunate, but since the EQ economy is a little messed up (too much cash flow/equipment flow in, not enough going out), Alchemy's profitability is doomed to go the way of the other trade skills.<P>Basically, to nothing compared to the time invested.<P>~Krono</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I am a master Fletcher, Smith, Baker, Brewer, and Potter. I can tell you to forget ever making cash on any trade skill.  <P>When the servers were new and I was one of the early master smiths I made a good profit selling banded more than making up the plat spent. Now you are lucky to get a plat over costs.<P>When Verent put in the new jewlery the first few enchanters made a killing selling jewlery.  Especially the high levels who were able to sell lowend plat items for 1000 or more. Now you can't give silver rings away and new enchanters will probably never get the investment back.<P>Now that Alchemy has some nice items the Shaman will make a great profit but no matter how much they try and prop up the prices eventually there will be plenty of shaman who will sell a backpack full of SOW potions for 100 plat. <P>Next Tinkering and after that probably baking just remember that these profits are short lived and enjoy them.  It is your reward for being first, not a right.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Falco if you find bakeing fun then that is the best reason i can think of to do it , this is a game after all and doing whats fun for you should come first ... <P>I just think that thay could be usefull as well as fun ... <P><BR>dulsin very good point about being first , but that puts the trade skills in the position of do it first or forget it ... i did get into the trade skills well after the first rush  and im happy i went throu the effort ... even if only one of my four mastered trade skills pays ... most only pay well if you do it first but tailoring can be such a pain to master im still makeing good cash with 10 slotters after doing it for a few months ... not grea cash for the time and effort but not so bad eather ...<P>Even after being on top of the backpack trade in my server for months now only a few others have joined me on the top ... and at the risk of giveing up market share i would go out of my way to give new , up and comeing tailors all the info and tips i could ... in the end the dificulty of tailoring has stoped a huge number of players that have started ... i thing if studded and reinforced would have sold a bit better more of them would have stuck it out ... this would have crippled my market but it would have opened this trade to other players and i dont see that as too bad a thing (i dont mind shareing) ... even with the proft margin cut in half it would still beat out smithing by far .</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>It is interesting to see all the varying results folks have had with trade skills.  It is also a real lesson in economics to see how the old price/demand equation works even in Everquest!<P>My personal experience has been VERY good with trade skills.  At levels 4-10 I was a tailor and made my own armor (patchwork) and also sold to other newbies ... not enough to make an real money but I suppled myself with good weapons (for a newbie) with the meager profits.<P>I recent months I have taken up fletching ... not to make money to to supply my ranger with ammo.  Well, lo and behold ... once a decided to build my own Trueshot Longbow (so had to get a skill level around 120) I discovered that other rangers would pay a LOT for a Trueshot.  Sure, it cost me about 700 pp to get to level 150 but I have made/sold about 25 bows since then.  At between 200 and 300 pp each that adds up FAST!<P>I do regret the time I missed leveling up (it very time consuming gathering all the NO DROP materials) but I now have a nice bank account, very nice weapons (purchased) and a full set of Ivy Ethed Armor (almost all purchased).  So, what I lost in leveling I made up for in equipment and now I hope that I can level without getting killed so much (hehe).<P>I guess that what you get out of trade skills is in direct proportion to what you put in (as well as the skill you choose and a little luck).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>FYI, I think trade skills are coming more into play.  On EverLore I've read baking a Rat Ear Pie is for the Paw of Opalla quest and making Pickled Frogglok for another quest.  Have no idea if this is true nor any details, just conveying what I read.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum8&number=8&thisthread=000984&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum8&number=8&thisthread=000984&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
