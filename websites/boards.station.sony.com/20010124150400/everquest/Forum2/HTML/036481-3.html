</FONT><HR>Dear Absor,<P>I want to point out something : Karn was well known for a long time on the VZ server. He has been in touch MANY MANY times with guides / gms. Heck he even got rewarded in a GM event. NONE of these GMs / Guides EVER told him his name was wrong. I find this unacceptable. If you would ask your way to a cop in the street smoking crack, do you think he would just give you the info and not arrest you because you're violating "the rules" ? It's not like these people have hidden their names  to everyone for 60 levels. Everyone know them within the VZ community.<P>Rules are rules i agree. But it's your responsability to make sure rules are known and respected. Naming policy exist yes, but it doesn't appear before you chose a name in game. It's sad that you couldn't forgive a newbie to not looking for all gaming policies before starting to play, having faith that if his name go through name filter, that means it's ok to play with.<P>Now someone got a little revenge on Karn with the help of a GM because his buddies were killed in PvP on a PvP server. That's some serious GM abuse.<P>The fact is it would have been ok imo to talk to them about changing their names. But the gm/guide decided to go the rude way, changing names without a single warning or anything. Customer service ? I think not. It seems GMs / guides are more concerned about using their powers than serving their customers. Service would have meant to give people a tell, expose the problem, and get a common solution.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One good thing about these threads is, today I saw a character with the name Trentreznor. I warned him that unless he wanted a GM to change it for him to start a new character with a less lame name. The warning I gave him was not because I was going to petition him, but because I know what the GM's will do if they ever see him. Fortunately this person was only level 4, so he could easily start over with a better choice of a name.<P>I've had friends who have had their names changed, even after 35 levels. They got ZERO warnings that it was going to happen, so if they had any unlooted corpses, it would have been just their tough luck I guess. I think that the GM's should have appropriate names for the game as well as the players, anyone ever see Nilli the Silli on Povar? Now if that isn't a direct violation of the naming policy I don't know what is. Luckily, I am no longer on Povar and I don't have to put up with the poor CS of the GM's on that server anymore.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>To the people of Verant,<P>  Take a deep breath, and repeat after me: "I am calm.  The flames do not burn me.  I am calm."  (doesn't work, does it?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> )<P>Now, as to the name policy problem.  The game itself does not follow the naming policy.  If the people that are paid to come up with character names can't do it without turning the occasional joke, why do you expect us to be able to?  Truely offensive names need to be changed, I think we all agree to that.  However, some of the "silly" names need to be left alone.  They are part of what moves the players of the game to talk to each other.<P>The "silly" names have become a part of EQ, names put there by both players and the EQ crew.  Fighting against it is like fighting against people soloing.  You can improve the game by keeping it down to reasonable levels, but trying to remove it completely will do untold damage to the game that is EverQuest (and torque off most of your customers).<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>heh, no offenese taken<P>However, I was getting upset about people taking things for granted as to how things can be viewed. <P>One thing though, even if the guy did create the name as a tribute to the Van Halen band, how does Van Halen downplay roleplaying? I am positive someone back 100 years or 1000 years had the exact same name. Certainly, Vhalen doesn't downplay a true roleplayer. Does it?<P>I see nothing wrong with any name, as long as, it is not down right foul. That's my own opinion. I have found that names, like Phisto Phury are a great name. If anything it ADDS to roleplay. It also adds to the "real life" function of conversation i.e. Someone compliments him, after awhile they are new friends..<P>If a GM takes my name, i will instantly cancel my account. It would be different if a GM had told me my names were not acceptable in the first place, WHICH HE DID ON MY FIRST CHOICE OF A LAST NAME. Then gave me the one I currently own  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>Anyway, my patch is done  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Everyone have a good night<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Firstly, I don't play on VZ, so I don't know any of the characters or players but from all that I have read the practises that are listed to be followed under the naming policy weren't. <BR>Personally I haven't seen this happen yet, but I am also sure that sooner or later I will, and to be blunt, I knew about the naming policy from the same friend who recommended the game. I hadn't actually seen it in any of the documentation that I have read (and occasionally re-read) until it was posted here. <P>I am sure that there is a marketing professional at Verant/Sony who could tell them about how badly negative word of mouth can impact a business. And that is what is going to happen simply because most people, myself included, either didn't/don't know about the naming policy, or don't know where it is at to be read.<BR>This is easily solved by making it a text box on the character creation screen button activated in the name block to display the policy.<P>As to NPC's not being named according to the policy, that I have seen, and I have to agree with most people in that if there is going to be a "law" it has to apply from the top down, and equally.<P>To the poster, I am sorry but I don't remember the name, who posted that you have a way to fix it, about names that you feel don't belong...<BR>If the name is sexually explicit, racially, or religiously slanderous let the person who has that name know that it's a violation of rule #1-3, (if I have the numbers wrong please forgive me). But if it is simply a matter of you don't feel it is appropriate, or in keeping with your ideals as to the game itself, then you might be better advised to leave it alone. Your views aren't the only ones involved, and quite frankly I find it petty and childish that anyone would think that theirs is the definitive ideas on what is or is not an appropriate name.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree with curve who said "It is also highly offensive to call GM's Nazi's - whether or not you agree with what they have done. I am sure if any of those GM's happen to be Jewish they'd be *extremely* offended to be termed in that light." but I also have something to add. Not only does that term offend people of jewish decent but it also offends those of us who are of german decent. I mean, that title was the name of a group of people who took germany, which was just recovering from WWI, and started WWII and in the end screwed the country up doubly. It isn't exactly a happy memory. So, to Pinkertonn, please THINK before you use racial and ethical slurs... I am honestly supprised that Absor didn't ban yah for that post. Oh yah, a list of all the people who would be insulted: French, Jewish, German, Japanese, American, Russian (oh god would the Jewish and the Russians be pissed), British, and..um... well pretty much everyone in central europe.

</FONT><HR>I hate to say it, but this time Verant is correct in enforcing the naming policy.  I saw a character named "Kunt" on a server last week.  Come on people, use some common sense on your names and there will be nothing to complain about.  <P>The only thing that I complain about is that Verant doesn't enforce the names in a more timely manner.  It should not take until level 60 for them to discover names like Crocodile Dundee.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, *sometimes* the GM's are right about names--like in the post I just read (a character named "kunt").  But just because they are right *sometimes* doesn't make them right all of the time.<P>Besides, I said before, where was the GM who was suppose to be checking names?  From what I've heard GMs say in the chat room, they are suppose to check the names when the character is created.<P>As for "Karn Age" I rather find it amusing.  I mean this game is full of carnage after all.  (Like we *don't* run around killing things?)<P>But someone pointed out earlier--and I read the naming policy rules.  **THE GM IS SUPPOSE TO GIVE THE PLAYER A CHANCE TO RENAME**  (as long as the name isn't sexually/racially offensive--aka violates naming rules 1 or 2)<P>As for posting the naming rules. . .  Why not put it in the box with the game?  Then NO ONE can claim "I didn't know it"  It'd only add a couple of pages after all. . .<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To my point. I just purchased the game in October. No where does it say to read the naming policy on a website when you install the game or make your characters. If this was in the license agreement, fine (it isn't), but to have a policy on some remote site that you aren't even aware of or forced to read is bad business and laziness on VI's part. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>Verant should definitely give the short and sweet naming policy in the character creation screens:<BR>"Choose a name appropriate to a fantasy setting".  They should also place the URL for the naming policy somewhere prominent, so that people who are curious could go look it up.  If they were really on the ball, they could put a button on the character creation screen that popped up the policy.<P>However, I don't think it is related to your license agreement at all and I don't think it is bad business.  If someone chooses a stupid character name, a GM will change it.  They don't get booted from EQ entirely, or even lose the character or anything on it, apart from the idiotic name, so I don't really see how the license agreement is involved.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Again, if I abide by the rules and then CHOOSE to petition someone who decided to create a character with a name that clearly falls outside of those rules to the detriment of my experience then guess what- I'm petitioning it. I don't see how that is "childish".<P>There's a cliche that it is bad to be a rat but who am I defending by keeping quiet about stupid names?<P>I'm realistic about this.

</FONT><HR>Ok i made some research and have found that the so-called naming policy to be missing in every manual i have (the everquest_manual and eqrokmanualsupplement files).<P>The original statement found in the EQ booklet is : " Give your new character a name suitable for Everquest. The Everquest server has a name filter, so some names will be rejected if they are either already in use or don't meet the standards of the game [...]"<P>What is found in the everquest_manual file : " The character's name must be suitable to a fantasy genre and not be a direct plagiarism of an existing literary character.  The best solution is to allow the character generator to create a name for the player, or for the player to create a name on their own instead of borrowing from an existing character.  Creating an offensive name or a name that is distracting or non-fantasy can result in the GM's changing the name or deleting the character with or without notifying the player. "<P>Now tell me how someone picking the name Karn in early August 1999 is supposed to know his name is violating "naming policy" ?<P>I'm surprised that VI usually decide to let the past erros slide when it comes to items (nerfing new items but usually not changing the items that have already dropped), but decided to get another approch when it comes to names ?<P>Proud owner of Ordontemp on VZ (yes it passed the filter)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I know we're way down on page 3 already, so probably a lot of people will already be in "skim mode", but here goes....<P>A lot of people here put their main complaint as "I'm level [51-60], but they changed my name!"  Probably a lot of those people have names like "Star Wars" or "Peter Jennings" or "Every Onelovesme".  Well, just from looking at the first name - "Star" or "Peter" or "Every" - there's no reason to suspect that any of those names need changed.  And when you do a /who - yes, even when guides and GMs do a /who - all you get is the first name.<P>So you create your character, work your way up to 20th, with the name "Karma", for example.  Nobody thinks anything is wrong with it, and nobody suspects anything.  Ding, 20th level, and you immediately type "/surname Chameleon".  Well, the guides and GMs don't (can't) hear about it until they see you running around somewhere or someone /petitions it.<P>Back in the day, only GMs and Senior Guides had the ability to grant surnames.  Some of you old-timers (though I figure you're all playing the game instead of reading the boards) remember the waiting - one week, two weeks, perhaps longer - for your name to come up on the surname lists, which were often dozens of names long.  Then they invented the /surname command, and put trust in the players (and gave them the benefit of the doubt) in order to eliminate one of the worst sources of customer dissatisfaction.<P>Name changes are done with care and discretion, and (except for the really obvious ones) often with the consultation of other guides and GMs who are online at the time.  They're not taken lightly, because even though this is one of the rules intended to keep EQ from degenerating into UO or AC, it tends to greatly upset the player receiving a name change.<P>In fact, the broken hearts of the people whose names I had to change were one reason I retired from the Guide Program.<P>Take care, all,<P>Dachannien Shund<BR>Senior Guide, Solusek Ro (retired)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Changes of names should not be done easily, as it was the case here. The players should be given a fair choise - MASS-RENAMING does interrupt also other players ENJOYMENT - i guess i will need to petition for an new updated friend list - this could be quite a bit of unnecessary coding. Changing names after having played more then 15months and 6month of Realtime sounds more likely to be a harresment then other reasons.

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>The reality is that there was still NO reason to alter Karn's first name, and zero precedent for it as far as I can see.  Like I said on the locked thread, Karn has had 1000s of interactions with different players since August of 1999 with zero problems, and also interactions with GMs - he had a Skull mask of Innervention for gods sake, a GM quest reward.<P>This also wasn't his first last name, it was pretty recent.  He had been Karn Voodospirit before, also Karn Fearstalker when he was with the Fearstalker group.  He's had at least one other too I believe.  Karn Age was pretty recent, at any rate.  And the point is all this time there has never been a problem with the name Karn, not from players, not from GMs, not from anyone UNTIL ANOTHER PLAYER DELIBERATELY PETITIONED HIM OUT OF NOTHING MORE THAN MALICE.<P>And for whatever reason, guide Aeyonash decided he didn't like Karn, 1 1/3 years after no one had any kind of problems with Karn.  Change the sirname, fine, but why clamp down on Karn?<P>http://www.geocities.com/karn_vz/Bye1.html<P>Finally, the defense you pull seems to 'role-playing'.  For a team PvP server, there is precious little role-playing, thanks to VI's reluctance to actually implement code prohibiting cross-teaming.  I chose team servers for their 'role-playing', but in reality high elves heal ogres just as easily on VZ as anywhere else.  Instead of fixing this breach in 'real-playing' you'd rather rob one of the server's oldest players of his identity--in the name of 'role-playing' no less.  Can you see why the rest of us might be just a little upset?<P>Please look into this Absor.<P>Regards,<P>Aadrya<BR>Arch Mage and Officer of Xanit K'Ven<BR>Vallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>From the Everquest License Agreement, part 6:<P>"...any player activity whatsoever which is, in our sole discretion, inappropriate and/or in violation of the spirit of the Game as set forth in the player rules of conduct, which are posted at www.everquest.com."<P>The Naming Policy is a part of the Rules of Conduct.<P>Now granted, perhaps the name policy should be a bit more prominent (and I like the idea of putting a line or two about it in the character generation screen.)  But it's at least referred to in the EULA, and you have no one to blame but yourself if you didn't bother to read the EULA before you hit 'I Agree'.<P>And to those who say that the naming policy is stupid because EQ isn't a roleplaying game, I have to disagree.  EQ is very much a roleplaying game.  We can have a long discussion about what roleplaying is, but suffice it to say that it's up to the players to roleplay, not Verant.  Verant can help to foster a roleplaying environment, and while I feel that they could do much more, the naming policies are one way they do try to foster it.<P>And one quick thing to those who feel that people who petition names are 'Nazis'.  When I see a name that I feel is against the policy, I may or may not petition it, depending on my mood.  *But* it's up to the server guides and GMs to change it.  The policies are there, but the people enforcing them are human.  That's why there are some inconsistencies.<P>Also, the length of time which a name has been in violation doesn't (and imho shouldn't) matter.  Someone in the first post made a reference to stealing from the company, and was told that it didn't pertain.  It certainly does.  Another reference would be like telling the cop 'But I've been speeding on this stretch of road for 2 months!' as he's writing your ticket.  If your name is in violation (as decided by the GMs) it's in violation, whether you've played for 2 weeks or  2 years.<P>Not all name changes are good.  Not everyone will agree on every single name change.  But the policy itself is necessary.  Look over the thread and you'll see that we all have different opinions on how to enforce name changes, if at all.  Verant has taken their stance with their policy.. the rules they have are their opinion on names.<P>Tween Talonstrike<BR>27 Wood Elf warrior, Luclin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One of our guildmember got her name "Sternenfunke" changed, too. This is German and translates to star flicker (not exactly, but you get the idea). A name which should not be to inappropriate for a mage. I can't see any violation of naming rules with this. The GM who did the name change referred to rule #11: composite words, which is true from a technical point of view, but the resulting name has a meaning of its own, so it should be valid.<P>While I am personally not a fan of names which uses modern languages, be them German, English or French the use of them should no reason to ruin a player after 48 levels. Especially on the Zek server your name is everything. Friends and enemies recognize you by your name, your reputation is linked to it.<P>Was that name not appropriate for a Fantasy environment ? Maybe, but so are at least the better half of all the names on Vallon. I usually pick up my character names by the random name generator, maybe modify the result a bit. I have choosen my surname by studying terms of Sindarin and Qenya (the languages of Tolkiens Middleearth) - no, it is no name that exists in Tolkiens world in this form, at least none that I would know of.<P>Nevertheless I am now curious when someone will petition for my name and with what reason.<P>Iuwene Melbrethil<BR>Druid of Kelethin of the 52th season<BR>Vallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>GMs have always been strict on the name policy. I dont see a problem with changing peoples names either. However, when a person plays for over a year with that same name, is it the players fault for that or is it the GM's fualt? Names should be filtered and/or changed at lvl 20, but not lvl 60.

I'm quite sure that rules that are not printed in the manual are invalid (actually I think they even have to be printed in Swedish, but who cares?). Ok, what I want to say is that I don't think that the naming policy has been "pretty clear" in any way.

</FONT><HR>Okay check my details and tell me if I am wrong.  A guide named Aeyonash changes some characters names that he believes are in conflict with VI's naming policy.  Okay...now am I the only one that can find offense in the name of the guide.  Break it appart and you find Aey on ash (Eye ON A**) and this guy is deciding what is offensive with other peoples names...please.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Perhaps we all need to go in the game and petition Bait Masterson as an offensive name?  What would happen if several hundred people were to do this?  Or maybe just start doing /who and finding all the names and just petitioning up everyone that seems to break the rules.  Inundate them with petitions, sounds like fun...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;I'm sorry that the name changes bother you so much. But it's not as though we've hidden the rules about naming characters. It is unfortunate that names breaking the rules remain in the game so long, and therefore the players get attached to them. But the rules are pretty clear, and we do our best to stick by our rules as tightly as we can. And those rules have existed since the game was opened, not thirty days into it.&lt;&lt;<P>Alan, you would make a good politician.<P>You mean to tell me that after months in the game, reaching lvl 60, the people that had their name changed have NEVER had any contact with a single GM?  They have NEVER filed a petition?  Of course they have, and the GMs and guides they had contact with found nothing wrong with their names or else they would have had them changed LONG ago!<P>Your naming rules are NOT "pretty clear".  They are very SUBJECTIVE!  What's perfectly fine for 99% of the people may offend 1% of the people so there you go and have them change their name for this 1%.   OR, what also could have happened is that somebody who lost to them in a pvp battle got mad and petitioned them for offensive names as a way to get back at them.  <P>This game's success continues in spite of the unprecedented ignorance and stupidy of Verant customer service.  You guys just don't have any clue whatsoever.  Your naming rules are very subjective and changing a lvl 60s name because of somebody being out to get them because of actions in game is ridiclious.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Didn't parse the whole thread, but just thought I'd mention this in case it hadn't been before:<P>Karn is the name of a named skeleton NPC in QHills.  I noticed him roaming the valley along the northwest corner of the zone not more than two weeks ago.  Didn't respond to hails, was green to my level 47, and was of neutral faction.  I left him alone, so I don't know what, if anything, he drops.<P>However, one of the rules in the name convention is that you can't use the name of any NPC.  I guess whether you know about the NPC or not, this rule is grounds for changing it.  I'm sure that under the non-disclosure rules that GMs and Guides abide by (not revealing any game information besides what is in the eq_manual.txt) they can't tell you that this NPC exists and where.<P>Sorry, Karn, I can see 100% why that name would be changed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It's a joke the whole name change thing, The gms's make you wait over 2 hrs to respond to serious game bugs that cause death, but they have tons of time to waiste tracking down players who have odd or non proper names. the answer to the problem is called ULTIMA ONLINE 2. EQ'S DAYS R NUMBERED, the thrill is wearing off the the hard core players like my self "since beta test 3" are tired of the little or no customer service be have been getting. Its more like what can we do this week to screw the player.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I recently petitioned a GM to rezz my friend Bodyandsoul after a server blip/crash led to his untimely death in Highhold. The GM was very helpful,but also quite rightly asked my friend to change his name...it obviously goes against item 11 or the naming policy.<P>He then said that he needed to change MY name: Maniacmat, as it "forms a phrase". Maniacmat has always been my name in all the RPG's I have played, and when I played D&D, and also (importantly) I had a good reputation on my server, as well as being known as a player that sells cheap armor with my Smithing skill (Business branding!!)<BR>What I cannot quite work out is which policy I have gone against...Maniacmat is not a phrase, but I feel that it is OK due to policy item 11...Descriptive Combination names are allowed.<P>To be fair, I have emailed the enquires desk (about 4 days ago) and am waiting for a reply - the GM was not heavy handed in my case, but I feel that he did not implement the policy correctly. <BR>Here's hoping for an amendment!<P>Maniacmat....Now Maniax!!!!!<BR>Torvonillous<P>p.s. My Cleric on the server has just reached level 20 and is call MOIST....any ideas for a surname!!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
