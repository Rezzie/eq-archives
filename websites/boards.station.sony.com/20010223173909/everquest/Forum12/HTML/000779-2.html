</FONT><HR>Absor your list is fine But for Gods sake leave Lich Alone...Why even include it in the list because now that you mentioned that it is Too "Powerful", it will be "fixed". You didnt Mention Dots and increasing Damage per tick . Are our Dots "Too Powerful" enough also? We just want to get all the damage our dots are capable of doing before the Mob is dead. What we are saying is make them do more damage per tick or some how speed up our Dots. And you suggest making Ignite bones have a longer Recast Time...Keep in mind this is our Best DD spell at level 44 and it is used in soloing also. The cast time on ignite Bones takes forever to cast as is.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok let me first start off by asking if you could reply to the biggest request made.  Reply in the form of I'll take them to development team or it's been discussed and no.<P>1st - The general idea that our role is mana pumps.  First most necro's here agree that its not in their character & they dont enjoy the role. Possible suggest would be to make it like the old mana stone spell - but make it targets hit points to targets mana.  ** (This would be better than what is suggested but shouldn't be the necro's only role during a raid) **<P>2nd - Fearless pets and or fear resist spell.  This was given to mages. Umm shouldn't this be given to necro to improve their function in a group.  Make it so they could cast on mages pets.  Give mages the ability to summon weapons tor ways to make pets more effective.  (more in character)<P>3rd - Castable feign death and/or group feign death.<P>4th - Damaging bosses with lifetaps (prob #1)<BR>why is this such and issue with the poor overall damage compared to other classes.<P>5th - The issue dealing with the cost of  summon corpse since SK's now have the ability.  Spell is mainly used during raids which are done by 46+ chars so shouldn't we get the replacement spell before 57th.<P>6th - Lich has been the way it is for quite some time.  If changed it prob wouldn't effect higher levels who can't solo anymore due to reduced mobs. I don't feel I should have to sell out my younger brothers just to be able to group post 54.  I would perfer just to let them be and enjoy the game the way i did pre 50th.  An retire my char.<P>I could go on but if you would respond to those six points.  I would be happy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Lich series: There is a small problem with the Lick series...it doesn't stack with the lvl 44 cleric healing spell "Celestial Healing". Why not?, these spells are not similar in the least. Please change this so that my cleric friends can heal me with the spell they feel is best (instead of getting a "does not take hold" message)<P>Night only spells: Remove the night only portion. They are useless as they are!<P>Feign Death: I have noticed that alot of the time I can attack a high level mob...have him agro...then successfully FD and he will leave and attack someone else, only problem is...he will come back and attack me later in the fight while I am still FD'd. Please look into this, and see if there is a problem with FD. I don't think a mob should return later in a fight to attack you again if he thinks you are already dead. (this specifically happened to me in the Plane of Air recently while fighting a gorgolask, as well as other situations that I can not name off the top of my head)<P>Darkness series: As I pointed out in the Epic Weapon part....we do not use darkness for the damage portion....we use it for snare, and therefor use our lvl 29 version cause it has a quicker casting time. Would it be possible to get a high level version with a LONG duration and short cast time?, damage would not be a concern...in fact it would be benificial to not have it do damage (very similar to snare)<P>All the above suggestions are for the Post-50 game, but there is one I can think of that would help throughout the necro's life....<P>Banshee Aura: Shortly after we get this spell we stop using it...why?, cause necro's can't tank past that point...that is what our pets are for. Please change this spell to be pet targettable.<P>Thanks,<BR>Xrist<BR>D.E.

</FONT><HR>I think the problem is that most of the posts necros made were not even read before we were told "everything so far has been read and I'll have a summary soon".  Of all the class-talk threads, Necros got the shortest amount of time to express their thoughts on their class.  Now, admittedly, SOMEONE had to have the least amount of time to express their ideas, but the necromancer class had only slightly over 2 days before their thread was finished (our class-talk was 'finished' on the third or fourth thread)...compare this to an average of 10 to 14 days for all other classes.<P>I would suppose this is because Alan came into the discussions with a pre-prepared checklist of what he already thought he knew the problems were.  What we eventually ended up with in this summary was a repeat of Alan's original posting to the class of his original items--ones that he was already willing to discuss.  Oh yes, and a couple of very minor additions that class-talk posters brought up.<P>I wish VI would just completely break the class post 50th level--they might eventually realize there are serious problems with necromancers that their cosmetic changes and superficial analyses simply will not fix.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ITEM: Mana transfer.<P>DESCRIPTION: If the Lich series bug is fixed, then perhaps a 2:1 transfer rate might be a fair change. Reducing the effectiveness of the hit point regeneration for necromancers will also lower their ability to transfer mana. Necromancers would like to see this ratio raised in any case.<P>STATUS: None<P>hehe,thats a funny one.i saw only one or 2 posts in all the necro talk topics,where necros wanted a better ratio.nearly all high level necros hate this spell and then you come here and  told us,we would like a better ratio?<BR>absor,seems that you ignored alot of the posts.<P>also the idea with the spell icons.i saw NO post about that.whos brilliant idea is this?<P>the same thing about st.we asked for a UPGRADE!!of this mid 20er spell to be susefull in groups and to break the chanters monopoly and avoide the situation,that 5 players shout 2 hours for a chanter..now it seems,that we have to expect a possible NERF of this spell.<P>the same feeling about ignite bones.we asked for the remove of the stuppid skelii illusion and to make it stackable!!DAMND,even CLERICS nuke better then necros.this spell is our only nuke and should STACK!<P>i can see the message from the live team next week.<P>we will get a nerf of st/lich/ignite bones(longer recast time then this 12!!!!!seconds)on the one hand and a better mana pump spell and fearless pets on the other hand.DAMND,ask your testers!fearless pets are not enough,because MOST of the mobs use aoe dd spells too and our pets die in 15 seconds in such a fight!!this spell will give mages a BIG power boost(their pets are immune to fire/poison/and soon fear)so their pets survive the battle while our WEAK pets die in the first seconds.increase the resists of the undead pets!!thats also ok from the roleplaying aspect.in MOST of the other big rpgs,undeads have a higher resistance to magic!!!<P>also,i was surprised to see,that WE the high level necros want only a upgrade of the 59er pet(which most of the necros will NEVER see,because of its stuppid rare drop rate).our 53er and 56er pets need a BOOST too.they are actualy crap for their level.remove this stuppid*situatio*pet idea and give us regular pets with more hp and better defense.actualy,there are NO NADA differenses between the 53er and the 56er pet.the 56er pet dies very fast like the 53er.it cant tank one second longer then the 53er one.our sucking pets need ALL a big boost after 50.<P>bah,i hate such long posts,when i can expect to reach nothing with them,because verant ignores the high level necros and absor makes a list with his own ideas and ignores 90%of all the qualified ideas of high level necros,who know the class BETTER then absor.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wow Absor, I can tell you read very little of the posts, and I really do think you had an agenda in mind.  Just say that you and VI don't like the necro class, stop allowing pepole to make one.  And then implament your nerf suggestions as above.  This will make all of us retire and you and VI will be happy.<P>Fix lich----why?....I almost die from it now, so make it easier for me...lol.<BR>Mana conversion---Why?....Oh great wiz/cleric/druid/shamon/enchant please take my mana because my spells suck.<BR>50+ spells---Why?  I am 53 and have 3 50+ memed...easy fix, just don't give us post 50 spells, we dont use them.<BR>Infusion---Why?....I would never in a million years use it on myself or another...so why make it targetable?<BR>Animation---Why?...Did you ask your child to come up with this one?....This is more stupid then mana pumping.<BR>Possession--Why? ....Ok, this is more stupid then animation...lol.<BR>Group DMF---in future?....why?....helps us save mana in groups and doesnt add to soloing.<BR>ST---Cool, but a nerf.---Leave it alone and create an upgrade.  Make that one the friendly one.. 30sec mez on spell cap mob with mem blurr....give us something.<BR>Things you forgot:<P>Why dont you lower our conjure corpse?...We should get this at 50 to compete with the SKs...Why have a broken necro that just gives mana when you can have a tank that does the same?<P>Group FD/Target FD----very good idea, and helps with grouping...doesnt effect soloing...HELLO?<P>Night Spells---make them usefull at all times...Do we only play necros during night eq hours?<P>Pets--Should be upgraded post 50.  A tank can kill them in seconds...very sad.  Dont give us a fear spell on them....just make them unfearable, simple.<P>Dont give us DMW...just fix KK to allow DMF...done...no new spells.<P><BR>Now, I do admit the spell icon, summon dead 1,2,3 (you were going to give us 3 like the mages right?), make the spells drop more, and poss removing the skell form from IB and CB, were the only good ideas you came up with.<P>I was very excited that you gave us a chance to speak about what we need.  Now I am so very angry that you didn't listen and want to kill of the class.  You and VI have an agenda and it's to kill the necro class.  I for one will just retire him and play the cleric or mage as you wish.  But, I will only do this until Horizons or maybe an eariler game comes out.  I will not pay money to be insulted by you and your company.  Remember VI and EQ and YOU have a job due to us.  I for one will take my money elsewhere too someone who wants me to have fun.  I have spent over 40 days of my life makeing what I thought was an awsome fighting machine.  You and VI have been steadly killing it and now want him to be dead.

I agree that most spells that require essance emerald just arn't worth it.  it is hard and expensive to find people who will loose that much exp without rez..so untill somtheing is done, convergance is the only spell i'll use.  Necromancers need to be able to do more damage, or have a few neat spells like the reanimation one.  you guys have always said that you want to promote grouping at higher lvls (god knows there no high lvl zones to solo except for myabe skyfire) well then make necros more useful in groups so people will group with us!  if i had known when i first started this character that when i hit 50+ i would be nothing but a mana battery for a cleric (a relatively inefficient one at that) i wouldn't have started playing a necro.   Surely the most evil class in the world should have some unique skill!  it seems like we are crosses between shadow knights, enchanters, clerics, etc.  the usefullness of 50+ necros reallyl needs to be looked at, if i didn't have friends in eq i would never be able to get a group.<P>Sinfully Yours,<BR>Paradise Perdu<BR>lvl 54 Heretic, Povar Server<BR>GM, Sinful Revelation</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor - I can't seriously believe you're going to ignore all the angry *customers* here.<P>In any other business if you had all customers of a particular type permanently complaining then pretty soon senior management would get involved and make you do anything it takes to first reassure and then solve the problems.<P>So many necros have made serious suggestions with practical ideas for how to change the class so we fit in more closely with our class definition.  However you just seemed to have ignored us!<P>Do you really want the game to end up with just warriors and clerics at high level?  Because that is just the way it is headed.  I think when you get together with the Live team you need to have a serious talk about the future of EQ and where the different classes fit into it.<P>Again, I make the plea - listen to necros who have spent so many days playtime with their class.  Don't just assume you know what our issues are - have you ever played a necro from Level 1 right up to 50+?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I dont understand the logic in any of those changes. <P>1. Nerf litch so we get mana back slower and die faster only to be able pump this mana (that we are geeting back slower now) to somone that can make better use of it. This is just plain insulting I have allways thought the idea of giving out my mana to somone else cause I don't have any better use for it just sickening. If you guys at Verant are just itching to nerf again I have an idea for one  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> nerf our mana transfer spells or just take them away alltogether and leave Litch alone.<P>2. Ignite Bones should be a regular DD spell who came up with the idea that necros shouldnt by nature be able to chain cast why must we have to wait so long to cast again and other necros have to wait to cast there IB while mine wears off.<P>3. DOT corpse poofing, I believe corpse poofing is not a bug at all its there to keep Necros from piling dots on a  giant or somthing and feigning to help ppl Level faster. Ok that being said any other class that can do fast damage can do this, Ill use a Wiz for an example he roots the giant, DDs till an inch of its life and ports out and then the lowbie kills it in 1 swing and then the Wiz ports back in cause hes bound there rinse and repeat. Im sure that example would get "fixed" if there was a way to but with DD spells its not possible but with DOTS it is, corpse poofs if the necro is not on the hate list and it dies of the dot even if others still are. Problem solved right? Nope the necro gets totally screwed and cant ever use DOTS on anything worth making sure that it will not poof, which is prolly the only things that will last long enough for the DOT to do full damage. Please take the antipowerleveling code that is obviously there off of DOTs if others can do it still how much does it stop powerleveling as a whole, and it will fix the corpse poofing "bug" and  let us use our DOTs in fights all the way to 60, Ill trade my mana transfer spells for that FOR SURE  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>4. This is not on the list but Ill suggest it anyway. This pertains to all pet casters. When we summon our pets we dont put a collers on them with our names and locations, if a pet gets feared off deep into a dungeon and gets killed how do the mobs know where we are  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/confused.gif"> how is it possible? The pet should just be killed and the monsters go back to what they were doing not form a train and come to kill the whole party. A pet should not aggro a train onto a party that is no where near where it gets killed. This is just one more reason that necros arent wanted on raids and yeah we want the anti pet fear spell too. Pet trains are very unrealistic and only serve to get many ppl killed. <P> Those are the changes Id like to see, as it stands now Necros are like a 2 year old loose in a glass shop on raids, one wrong move and everyone is dead or the uber mob poofs and all that effort was for nothing that is why we got downgraded to lowly mana pumpers. That list sucks Absor rip it up  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> and never mention nerfing Litch again please, K. Necros need a major unnerf not anything new and we can play as we allways have post 50, im only 45 so the issues of 50+ spells are beyond realm of knowledge but listen to the others they seem to know somthings wrong.<P>/em Holds out her mana transfer spells by the corner like they were a stinking diseased rat corpse. <P>You can have those back Verant thats not my job.<P>Ainami B'lair&lt;Seekers of Lore&gt;<BR> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"> The don't nerf Litch witch from Bertoxx  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>What do you mean "what class do you play Absor"?<BR>I've forgotten who wrote this, but its pretty clear Absor plays a Druid (not happy with his ability to solo as well as anyone, Teleport, Heal, Buff, SoW,etc...)  Now they are getting more healing powers? <P>At this rate, Druids are only one more patch away from getting Reserection I swear.<P>Well, enough of the Class Envy, Nerf Lich and all necros will be gone.  A dead race.<P>I suppose I could keep my necro Camped at the AC spawn in Guk to twink my new Druid.  I guess he could still be of some use.  <P>*puts on his overalls and his Farmers Union T-Shirt and CENEX cap*<P>We're not asking for mage pets or Wizard nukes, cleric heals or Druid's "everything else".  We just want our pets not to die in 3 or 4 hits should our now highly resistable spells get resisted.  ONE spell that could hurt one of the Uber Mobs in ANY fashion, something, anything, just a little bit.  Resurection that wasn't so incredibly costly.  Change the component to a questable item that takes 4-5 hours to complete.  This would make completing the quest worse than soloing, the xp you get back soloing would be greater than the xp gained from a rez, but our ability rez the Cleric might not be too bad.<BR>Maybe a spell that reduced the Uber Mobs AC and Str and make it stackable with its self.  Make it reduce 20str and 50 AC or something.  The more necros, the greater its reduced.  Tanks take less damage and do more damage.  Its along the lines of our life draining class for RPing, not worth casting while soloing, still not as good as a group of Wizzies nuking, but its something.<P>Nerfing Lich will end all necros!<BR>No More Mana Battery Duties!<P>Playing some panzy tree hugger makes me want to Vomit, but this is what EQ is pushing for.

Yes, I'd like to see some improvements made to our class(just like every other class is getting), but NO improvement is worth having Lich nerfed.<P>I also can't believe you are thinking of nerfing the lich line to allow you to better the mana transfer ratio of our mana battery spells.  Take the entire mana transfer spells out of my spell book, and leave lich alone.  We NEVER asked for these spells, nor did we want them.  Absor, do you even know WHY we have the mana transfer line?  It was thrown to us as a bone to keep us quiet after you decimated our pets with the dagger nerf(the 3rd pet nerf).  Well, it DID NOT even come close to making up for the pet nerf, and NOW you are turning around and using it as an excuse to nerf lich?!!  I will be retiring my 56th level nerfromancer and quitting EQ altogether if this happens.<P>Also, it is NOT a balance issue.  All of the kunark and velious balancing/testing was done with the lich "bug" in place.  We are balanced with lich working the way it does now!  Changing it back is nothing but an unwarranted NERF.  Lich is no more overpowered than Clarity 2 or Cannibalize 3. <P>To sum up, many of the things on your list SHOULD have been done a long time ago, but... If you feel the need to nerf lich in order to give us any of those improvements, we'd rather you leave lich alone and keep your "improvement."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>NEW ADDITIONS TO THE NECROMANCER CLASS:<P>These improvements are pending further review in light of the fact that Necros are STILL so overpowered that they make a level 5 Bard cry.<P>1: Necromancers will now be permenantly equipped with Oracle Robes. The golden pasties on the robe will now act as retractable jumper cables. By right clicking on these jumper cables and then left clicking on your targeted Cleric, you will then be linked in synchronous mana swap. This will help keep the Cleric charged with mana. This will include an awesome graphical effect of two cables coming from your chest and locking onto the clerics ears. Particle effect lightning going back and forth these cables will be added in once this goes live.<P>2: Necromancers will now be equipped with an extendable antennae which will protrute from their rears. During combat this will allow the Necro to pick up radio transmission, and be able to download various songs from Napster. Providing the group with musical entertainment. Also as an added bonus, Necros will be able to cast Voice Graft on their pets and be able to transmit in full stereo.<P>We hope you will enjoy the new upgrades. I am sorry we could not address any of your issues concerning the class, but the truth of the matter is...well. We just didnt bother to read your thread. Sorry and enjoy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Thanks for posting you ideas Absor but I think you have made some serious errors and left out some of the most important ideas. <P>**ITEM: Ignite/Chill Bones<BR>You are on the right track with just removing the Illusion effect.  This would be the easiest fix and the most likely to not be messed up.<P>**ITEM: Lifetaps<BR>Accept it Lifetaps are meant to be unresisted.  They where from the first day EQ went live and where only nerfed after Necros began using them upon mobs well above their level.  To this day they are still unresisted by mobs within the spell cap EXEPCT epic mobs.  Not sure if this is because of some mystic "No Tap" flag or if VI just maxed out Epic mobs magic resistance levels.  Maybe just moving Taps to another resistance category would make the difference.  <P>**ITEM: Mana transfer<BR>I am probably one of the few Necros that likes this line but improving this spell line WILL NOT help the Necro class.  There is nothing more disappointing then the feeling of giving your mana to another class because they can actually do something with it.  No one plays this game to the upper levels to feel worthless and that is what this spell is all about.<P>**ITEM: Essence Stones<BR>These are a very, very bad idea.  The only actual use for them is in Uber guilds that power level 'Mules' for the sole purpose of harvesting Essence Stones.  No one is willing to give up DAYS worth of xps for 1k mana or 1.1k damage.  NO ONE.<P>**ITEM: Defoliation.<BR>"Certainly this spell needs to be limited in its use because it is overly efficient against one monster type."<P>Just a second here!  How can a spell that affects ONE realm of monster type be overly efficient?  Do you understand that this is plant only?  This spells is SUPPOSED to be good because it is limited to one type of creature...<P>**ITEM: Lich Series<BR>I am torn with the fix.  On one hand I believe you have no choice but to fix it [otherwise we look special] yet VI has already commented that they where going to leave this spell line alone.<P>No matter what course is taken this spell line NEEDS to stack with Clarity.  There is no logical reason why it does not.  Even Cann stacks with Clarity and it is basically the samething as Lich.<P>**ITEM: Trucidation<BR>Making this lure resistance and still using the Essence stone is not going to help anyone BUT Uber guilds.  This is a very bad idea and one that should not even be considered.<P>**ITEM: Pets and Fear Immunity<BR>This is not enough Absor.  The pets natural resists are far to low for this to matter.  Our pets die in under 15 seconds to mob with AoE attacks so what difference is it going to make if he does not run away?  I have had my 59th lvl pet 'slowed' by 30ish lvl Shaman NPCs.  Necro pets need to have their resists buffed up.  This could be down by the level of the pet or through our 3 pet buff spells.  I also do not see why Fear immune pets are such a big deal.  You do know that Mages pets have been immune to Fire, Cold and Poison from the beginning and now when they get Fear... Think about that for a second and then look at our pets.<P>**ITEM: Stacking Bug with Splurt<BR>Add the Shaman Epic Spear aswell.  I have no idea why you guys gave it Splurt as an effect but now you have a whole new problem with stacking.<P>**ITEM: Screaming Terror<BR>Trust me this spell does not work upon any mob that a Chanter can not mez.  Now I agree that a Chanter should be able to over write the spell and perhaps that can be fixed.  At this point I do not want to see the orginal spell affect brough back.  It never worked correctly and caused alot of deaths [and we where told several times it was fixed...].  It works good now and as become a useful in the lack of a Chanter.<P>**STATUS: Coffin Availability<BR>Need to be in every town where there is a Necro/SK guild.  VI dropped the ball on this one bad.<P>**ITEM: 59th Level Pet<BR>Remove the Peridot regeant as the reason for the cost [auto duel wield] was granted to all pets over 39th lvl.  Also I would look into ALL expansion pets.  They all seem to be underpowered when compared to Tanks and mobs in the expansion.<P>**ITEM: Cannibalize and Mod Rods<BR>This is in very poor taste Absor.  You know that if you nerf either of these spells it will look like Necro asked for it because Lich maybe reduced.  If you where concerned about checking them out you should have addressed that in their threads not ours.  Last thing Necros need is more players disliking us...<P>A couple other questions for the live team.<P>**Item: Night Time only spells<BR>Why are Necros the class with the MOST restrictions upon their spells?  Why is our upgraded Harm Shield a night time only spell?<P>**Item:  Root Line<BR>Who's smart idea was it to give us 2 lower verisons of root in the expansion.  Enstill [53rd] and Immobilize [58th] are actually lower level verisons of Paralyzing Earth [49th].  Para Earth over writes both of them.  So what is the deal here, why give us two lower level Root spells???  Remove them and give us something else.  The fact that VI messed this up seems to just escape your attention.<P>Briljin D'Aerthe<BR>59th lvl DE Defiler - Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

How does that compare to the other 3 caster threads?  I've been over there.

</FONT><HR>I think the "status none" means it hasnt been taken to the dev team yet. This is basically a summary of the summary of the talk thread summary where he summarized our topics but then failed to summarize during the talk and just skipped right to a base summary. So, in summary I think its just on the summary list. Im sure it hasnt even been discussed among the dev or live teams yet...well, except for the Lich nerf. Im sure they cant wait to get back to work on Monday and put that in.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Not mentioned in your list<P>Trepidation is suppose to be an upgrade to invoke fear, I would really ask that this be looked into, as for costing twice the mana, it appears to actually have a worse effect(less max duration), with no benefit what so ever.<P>On Torvonilous<BR>There is currently<BR>4 level 60 necros <BR>1 level 59 necro<BR>and about 5 other necros that are 56+<P>Every 56+ necro has their 56 pet, the drop rate of the 56 pet was upped quite abit about 4 months ago in skyfire, and as our server is only a year old(came out with kunark) the drop rate is pretty close to the rate we are getting 56+ necros, im sure older servers with their massive numbers of 56+ necros have yet to catch up<P>2 of the 5 59+ necros have the 59 pet, its a pain to get, but some things should be I guess, though when you consider the pet, and the cost of casting it, one has wonder.  Its one thing to make sure the mage pet is better, but there is alot of room between the non epic mage pet(god forbid we compare our pets to the epic) and any 50+ necro pet(the community seems fairly split on which of the 3 50+ necro pets is actually the best)<P>No one has chill bones, this spell has to my knowledge never dropped.<P>No one, not even clerics, has banishment of shadows<P>Devourering darkness and quivering veil of xarn are both more common then the 59 pet, and most of us have it.  <P>--------------<P>Screaming terror, as mentioned before, the only real beef with this spell is that enchanters cant overwrite it, they should be able to, and their ability to do so would have no effect on our power, but make our small group abilities less annoying to others.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I know Absor won't be reading this but I'll post it anywayz. There is a problem with necro's. They are overpowered but ONLY IN LOW LVLS. I single necro can solo a kitty in Iceclad and farm earrings but a 50+ necro can't solo anything? there seems to be a problem here that Varent mistakenly is trying to fix by nerfing the wrong side of the class. They seem to think that in order to fix the low lvl necro's they should nerf the high-lvl one's? I just need to ask one question. Did you guys ever take a basic logic class because your reasoning skills seem to equal those of the kitties I'm killing.<BR>Netweavr (no last name THANKS GMs I REALLY APPRECIATE TAKING AWAY MY SURNAME BUT NOT TELLING THE SYSTEM SO I CAN'T PUT ON A NEW ONE)<BR>lvl 30 ( I HATE HELL ) necro<BR>Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Are we , the people who play your game for 90 played days in my case, so stupid that we know nothing of the class?<P>Have you ever played a character to 50+ to be doomed to be a manastone because of 1 line of spells? 60 with 90 played days not 60 because a GM buffed you to it.<P>Have you ever had one line of spells nerfed, Upcoming Lich nerf, because after 2 years its suddenly a bug (reminds me of dagger delay)?<P>Have you ever sat in Chardok for 2 days dumping mana for 8 hours on as your main contribution even though you can tap the mobs since your the only class that can give mana your a manastone for the chanter/cleric? <P>Have you watched your pets get feared away or get killed in the first 2 rounds of combat on Boss Mobs due to not resistance whats so ever?<P>Have you sat in the PoS summoning 30+ people's body for 2 days to get to Isle 7 to have multiple crowns drop while the cape on 4 is so rare as to not exist? This place is a money/exp sink atm and everyone knows it. Why no CoH ? Why make this place so tedious that I bet you wouldn't even go there.<P>Have you ever killed Innorruk after Innorruk and Cazic Thule after Cazic Thule to have your epic items not drop? I know wizards can relate to this one, those poor guys are screwed.<P>Have you went on raid after raid where all you are is a downtime reducer for buffs and mana giver?<P>Have you watched in awe of rogues double backstabing for 500+ while you get "Your target has resisted Deflux/Touch of Night"? ALL your dots as well after getting permission to use a dot on the mob mind you. Wheres the Balance?<P>Have you ever watched a warrior fight a mob barehanded so he can let the other group get the kill in a 2 group situation to balance exp because no matter what you did you couldn't put out enough damage fast enough to make a difference?<P>Have you sat in Sebilis for hours at zone in asking for groups to be passed over for any other class that zones in? Or to finally get a tell and it be for summon corpse?<P>Have you ever seen EVERY cleric/ranger/rogue/monk in your guild get their Epics while yours is deemd so worthless/tedious to get as to not be bothered with?<P>Have you ever went to nuke an obviously undead mob to get the message "This spell only works on undead"?<P>Have you ever went to cast a snare spell on a mob to have it take so long to cast that the mob is out of view?<P>Have you ever fought Venril Sathir where your only roll is to dump a wizard mana?<P>Have you ever fought Trakanon where all your role is to cast dmf and dump mana? Aoe kills pet to fast to make it not worth casting btw.<P>Have you ever landed a tap on Woushi the dragon in Wakening lands after debuffs that is a Red Con at 60 to have your tap resisted after the same debuffs on Severilous in Emerald Jungle or Rage Fire in Sol B that are Even and Blue cons?<P>Have you ever went to fight a mob that has 512,000 hitpoints give or take to have all your Dots resisted , all your taps resisted?<P>Have you ever had someone cast invis on you to kill your noisey 59 pet?<P>Have you ever went to cast your main DD spell Ignite (chill is so rare I'll never see it) to be told not to on a raid?<P>Do you regularly keep spells you got when you where 16, 24, 34 memmed because your upgrade , If any, is a waste of mana? I.E. Trepidition, Feign Death and Screaming Terror.<P>Do you have fun watching a cleric out nuke you?<P>Have you ever summoned a 53/56/59 pet to watch them die faster than it took you to summon them?<BR>Or summon a green pet at 60? Why do we get to 60 for anyway whats the benifit?<P>Have you ever seen your pets hit every 5th combat round on a mob? Drastic but it does happen on anything I'd fight in a raid level situation.<P>Have you ever seen your 49+ pets miss a dry bone skeleton 3 times in a roll to hit it for 13 then finally kill it?<P>Have you ever been on a raid where you most valuable ability is to save an important class from taking a deathtouch?<P>Have you ever went to use your undead nuke in SoV er wait there are so few undead ,2 that I know of, that this spell is never memmed now?<P>Have you ever went to the Plane of Growth looking at all the plants and not being allowed to use your plant nuke?<P>Have you ever casted your fastest dot in a group setting to have the mob be dead 15 seconds later?<BR>Or you go LD and the mob poofs? Dot something and Feign Death do this a few times and you will get a mob to poof. I've done it myself I dont' see how your testers can miss this one?<P>Have you ever casted any dots on a mob to have the warrior unable to taunt it off meanwhile someones Sunstriking it for 1600 + damage taking no aggro?<P>Have you ever played a game where the developers are doing everything in their power to remove 1 class from the game? <P>Have you ever played a game where your class has been nerfed in some way almsot every other patch?<P>Have you ever played a game where the developers fine tune the Boss Mobs based on the Elitest of guilds?<P>We are a square peg (solo class) that you are wanting to fit into a round hole (group game). Unfortunately nothing we will say will matter the bottom line is all that matters. People who group tend to stay with the game longer since they make friends and bonds that keep them wanting to play even when they aren't having fun.<P>I'd like an answer to these questions? Its apparent you didn't read beyond your only post in our talk thread.<P>We are but a shadow of what we once where but still pay for I just dont' understand.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
