I for one dont want to continue playing a game where I can get banned for a similar incident. Its called being informed.<P>"Why do we 1) instantly believe everyone who claims to have been banned unfairly or for no reason."<P>Not saying we believe anyone here. For one the moderator of gamersrealm.com has said he knows for certain that Verant banned the wrong guys. Considering Verant's track record, even your eyes have to light up on this one.<P>"2) think we have a right to information regarding any banning we disagree with (based upon one-sided, self-serving stories, in general),"<P>Yes we do have a right to know. To turn a blind eye to even potential innocent victims goes against the grain of Justice.<P><BR>"3) assume we can armchair quarterback based upon incomplete, 2nd- and 3rd-hand information?"<P>No quarterbacking really. Its more like applying pressure from below to the Verant heads at top to come clean on this issue.<P>If Verant is in the right, then all is well.

</FONT><HR>Bloodsage,<P>Sorry but this one is defintely our business.  If players can be "disciplined" for written statements made to 3rd party boards under fantasy names I need to know about this fact.  I have pissed people off in EQ before and I imagine most everyone else has also.  What is to stop them from "setting me up" using my fantasy name?  I used to post my character name to this board but I can assure you I never will again.  <P>Mystere was none of my (our) business. <P>Tweety was none of my (our) business.<P>I play this game 25+ hours per week (would play 40+ if I had the time) and the thought that the time I have invested (and all E-Bay BS aside - time is money and I got a ton of "money" in my EQ account) can be "stolen" from me based on very suspect "evidence" is deeply concerning.  <P>At this point, I really need to hear one thing from VI on this matter.<P>"We made this decision based on information that was completely independent of the fantasy character name in question."<P>In absence of this statement, I will quietly exit these boards and the "Internet EQ Community" and mark my time until another company earns my $10 a month.  I certainly hope that VI can at least verify that there was compelling evidence beyond.<P>1.) Poster Z used fantasy name X to post info that only a guide would know.<P>2.) Person Y has a character named X and also has a guide account.<P>3.) Poster Z = Person Y.<P>If that is the case, its been nice talking to you (it really has you are a voice of reason in a sea of flame).  <P>/em is waiting with baited breath for a VI response.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Yes, I know two of those who claim to have been banned are posting to this thread.  That simply lessens their credibility, since there is nothing they can do to help their cause on a message board, other than stir up trouble.<P>Just re-read Abashi's post to make sure I'm not insane--ops check good.  He did not name any names.  He did say they had reasonable proof without the IPs.  Where do you get that he admitted these particular individuals were banned?<P>When demanding proof from Abashi, why are you not doing the same from these others?  Visionator seems one of the few taking the stories with the proper grain of salt.<P>If you'll check these boards, you'll find plenty of claims of unreasonable banning.  Some are stupid enough to post the whole story, and it's completely obvious they were banned for a reason.  Some try to color the story, and it comes out in debate that they did indeed screw up and get caught.  Others try the innocently standing on a corner routine.<P>Yet without making confidential data public, there is no way for VI to counter these accusations.  And, despite what you seem to think, woolybooger, you are _not_ entitled to a detailed explanation of every decision you find questionable.<P>Here's a mental exercise--point to anyone banned without proof and reason in the past.  Remember that there were both in Mystere's and Tweety's cases, whether or not you agree.  Otherwise, why not sit back--you have no stake in this.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Armorydave,<P>Like I said: if the situation plays out the way you're afraid it might, then I'm right behind you.  I simply cannot credit anyone at VI being stupid enough to equate .sig with in-game character as evidence enough to take action.  Perhaps some first-level weenie might, but I can't see it passing muster upon review.<P>But the bit about third-party boards is a red herring.  Some forms of speech are simply not protected.  Copyright violation, breaking non-disclosure agreements, and libel are among them.  Instead of pointing the finger at Verant for fighting for their rights as a corporation, we should be frowning upon those who break laws and contracts.  Doesn't matter _where_ one posts copyrighted material, or breaks their non-disclosure, or libels--they are wrong.<P>I still don't see anything to get worked up over yet.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

This is about "Banning policy" and as a player I need to be reassured about the methodology used when determining who is to be disciplined for 3rd party internet posts.

</FONT><HR>Being one of the few that have done this (I used to moderate a message board for another company)  I know how this works.  Let's say that I was getting illegal posts from someone.  I traced it to an AOL user.  AOL will not give me the specific logs so I can block the person.  I wind up blocking x.y.z.* to keep the illegal poster out.  What I wound up doing is blocking all AOL users in the city of New York or the State of Illinois.  It is not something that can be done immediately.  It would take us 3 - 5 working days to trace a single violater if the ISP would give the logs freely.  In short, they did not do it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
