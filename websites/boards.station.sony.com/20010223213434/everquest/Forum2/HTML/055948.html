</FONT><HR>1.  they wont be able to do everything as well as the warrior.<P>Rangers will be able to have the damage of a warrior (skill wise), but wont have the equipment to match them and thier defense will be SIGNIFICANTLY less then yours, both in equipment and in skills.<P>Palidans will have the defensive skill of a warrior, but wont have the same quality equipment, and wont have those all important skills like DW & ripost, and they certainly wont have the AWE INSPIRING disciplines that the warriors get.  Warriors also have significantly more hps then ANY of the hybrids.<P>So in short, Warriors will have a better AC, tons more hps, better offense, better skills, and better equipment then any hybrid ever will, that is from 1 to 60.  Not to mention the difference in the races most hybrids can choose, except for SKs, hybrids simply cant be the super strong HP machine races that warriors can be (namely troll,ogre,barb).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"Who would pick a warrior for a common camp now that hybirds can take damage almost as good and have same offense BUT can also heal them-selves, buff them-selves, and use spells to damage mobs."<P>It's ironic that you mention this, because how often are you in a common camp that all hybrid buffs and heals aren't being overwritten (buffs) or unused till downtime (heals, which are always done by a priest class).  Your argument only holds true for a hybrid only group, of which I have only been a part of one.

</FONT><HR>Axem: I think that hybrids and warriors are reaching a pretty ideal balance around now... why?  Because more and more, groups are able to take a "tank" into the group, who fulfills the "tank" role.  It's not about who gets picked over who; it's about who can fulfill a function.<P>The different classes will perform differently.  Random examples: if our tank is a paladin, I'll need to heal a lot less.  If our tank is a shadowknight, we'll have feigned pulls on our side.  In either case, I'm probably going to have to use some mana on DoTs.  If our tank is a ranger, I'm going to have to religiously slow everything and not skimp on hit point/AC buffs, but I won't feel any great compulsion to cast any damage spells.  If our tank is a warrior, s/he has a billion hit points, and I'll have the luxury of letting regrowth do practically all my healing, because emergency heals will be less necessary.<P>What's my point?  All those classes can fulfill a role in my group--they mean different things to what my group will be able to do and how it will work, but they're all roughly equivalent in terms of "all the jobs of this group are being handled."  I think that's balance.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Name one other class that has both the defense and offense of a warrior? SK's and Paladins? Nope, they can play meat shield almost as good as a warrior (almost) but do considerably less damage. Rogues, Monks, and Rangers? Nope. They all do the same or a little more damage than a warrior, but get turned into mush becuase they don't compete in the AC department.<P>Sure, you can get lets say Paladin and a Rogue, and together they can tank as well as a Warrior. Guess that's as good a reason as any for all the warriors to quit. Hey, whats the use of playing when a group can get two other players to do the job of one player.

It's just that I hate seeing people claim that warriors have better weapions than others because it isn't true.<P>Also, warrior armor drops are pathetic, and there is a severe lack of warrior only armor.  This should be our defining stuff, our alleged high AC difference, but many warriors are wearing blue at 50+ because drops suck so bad, server warrior population, and zero intermediate Warrior only armor.<P>I agree, in a perfect world, warriors have those advantages, but the stuff just isn't there, and the illusion of a perfect world fades into the sunset.<P>Frod</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

You can't be better at Defense UNTIL THE BLOODY SKILL RAISES.  So, even though they have the same skill cap as we warriors now do... it means NOTHING until they can get that skill up there above their previous cap.<P>Around level 55+ is when you MIGHT see your defense starting to cap, and when the Paladin/shadowknight will be stronger defense-wise than the Paladin/Shadowknight's of that same level were prior to the change.<P>Warriors are NOT going to be replaced throughout this entire game just because the Paladins and Shadowknights can take the hits a little better 55+.  Pre-55, there is NO difference in Paladins and Shadowknights with or without this change.

</FONT><HR>Heh warriors are great solowers at lower levels, just have a friend summon up a heap of bandages for you.  I know a few warrior who solo quite a bit, you just have to know how to use the abilitys given to you.<P>1.  Tons of hp, you can easily fight blues with little risk even at 50% healt and it only takes a minute or two to bandage yourself up to half.  If you can't afford bandaids make friend with a magician and get a couple packloads off him.<P>2. Cheap, powerfull equipment.  Warriors get their hands on good gear much easier than other classes, being able to wear/wield better gear is a huge advantage.<P>3.  Critical hits and stuns are extremely usefull, you can take down an opponent much easier than any hybrid.<P>In a group you will always be main tank, much higer hp, higer ac, better damage avoidance.  Even with higer defence a hybrid will never be as efficient at tanking as you will, as a ranger I prefer to be in a group with a warrior since i end up becoming a mana siev when i'm forced to tank, warriors are an extremely powerfull class period, it all comes down to efficiency.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Are you really level 60 in an uber guild? I would think at that level you would know the weakness of the paladin class by now. Its very simple you see, if defense/dodge/parry/reposite were the same between a warrior and a paladin...<P>1) the warrior has a bonus to HP, so they would still have more HP<BR>2) a warriors armor is has a lot more AC than a paladins, ie cobolt legs have 35AC, deepwater has 25AC<BR>3) Your offense is in every way superior in evey way to a paladins.<BR>4) the game is ALL about offense and how fast you can kill the mob. The faster you kill the mob, the less hits you take. There is no amount of AC in the game that can substitute for poor melee.<P> If a rogue,cleric/wizzy are looking for a tank, who would make a better tank? A warrior who can take the same beating as well as a paladin(assuming all defense skills are the same) and deal very good damage? Or a paladin who can take the hits but the fight lasts longer, so over all her takes more hits which requires more healing. I think the warrior wins hands down. Oh, and for those who think that our heals are worth a damn - if the paladin were the tank, then he WOULDN'T be able to even cast a heal while being hit! And as for downtime healing, thats a joke, the paladin would heal himself and med up for the next fight. All and all the warrior is the most efficiant tank in the game - period.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Dun that's a pretty bold statement..<P>Considering a human monk (pure melee) has just over half the hit points of an ogre warrior (pure melee), and takes considerably more damage (on average) when getting hit, I'm confused as to exactly which definition of 'marginally better' you are using.<P>As for damage dealing, with the abundance of powerful warrior weapons available for the mid-level characters.. warriors come very close to, if not exceed, the damage capabilities of a monk.<P>Remember pre-kunark when a level 50 warrior with 2 Ykeshas was considered super powerful..?  Your damage dealing statement might hold true back in those days.  The gap has narrowed significantly.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
