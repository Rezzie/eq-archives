</FONT><HR>ok well i just made lvl 40 with my warior and discovered to my shock that my 2 hand slash ,1 hand slash and pirce skills cannot be trined past 200 this cupled with the fast that kick caped ages ago along with dogde and these cant be trianed or go up any more now parry at 200 cant go up any more i sadly learned my last abillty at lvl 35 with the ratther shabby disarm. Now at lvl 40 i find not only do i get no new abiltys (and of corse no spells) but i no longer gain wepon skills or ripsote/parry/dodge/kick skills either wtf is th epoint is having a lvl 50 warior if hes identical to a lvl 40 one except he has more hp and maybe hits slightly harder??? From what i can see warrior realy get the short end of the stick  i mean even stupid human monk can get dual weild ect to 255 but poor warior has to stop at 200 that plus monks just had there speed of attack incresed + they keep geting skills past 40 .. guess no one at verant cares for wariors</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ill try to forget about the stupid human monk part, considering there are people with brain disease out there and I do not want to be politically incorrect...<P>Yes we do get a better dual wield, that surprises you? I mean we fight with our fist all our lives while you guys change weapons constantly while having preferences... And besides, a karate expert will it you a lot more times than someone with a sword... And since our fist are not necessarilly the bbiggest damage dealers out there, we needed to get more hits in.  Since verant did say that monks were the best melee damage dealers. Warriors are premiere tanks and second rate damage dealers. You cant expect you guys to have tons of hp, ac that actually does something (Yes monks have higher ac, but that is for those people that cant think beyond numbers, what I mean is, monks ac is used in damage avoidance and not damage mitigation, even with all is Ac, a monk will get hit for A LOT more than warrioR)<P>And since we have near 1/2 of your hp, we dont have weapons that procs, not so good equipment out there, and our ac division doesnt help us to be good tanks, we needed to be a lot better somewhere and that was fighting.  Feign death can be used to feign pull, but then again, a Sk and a necro can do the job, maybe not as well, but still good. A monk skills are self reliable first. <P>We are the damage dealers, second rate tanks, you guys are premiere tanks, second rate damage dealers, it wasnt meant to be otherwise.<P>EVERY melee class deserves something to look forward after level 40, we may still get some increases in our skills, but like you guys, disarm at 36 is the last thing we get. So stop degrading other classes to get yours to be boosted.  as ka new skill for warriors and stop spitting on other peoples yard.<P>Slaide<BR>Level 39 Monk<BR>Fennin rO</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>If I remeber right... warriors are the ONLY class in the game that get nothing after 40. More hp you say? Wrong sorry would you like to use your life line? At 49 to the big 50 I got a huge 43 hp! After I saw that... I no longer feared death and loseing 50 because I had nothing to look foward too.<P>You said that monks use their hands all their life right? Warriors use weapons all their life! Differnt type yes but mostly the same style. Why not just give warriors weapon spelization to train in one or two wweapons to get their skill over 200 to just set them selfs aside from the other hybrids who allso have the same weapon skill cap!<P>Warriors only need 3 things, higher weapon skill, a slight hp maybe ac buff, and some way to get hp back faster. Like a quest to add regen to the crafted bp like the rubby bp. No one else would be able to use it other than a warrior so there wouldn't be a problem with that. Right now 2 hp a tick at 50 with 2000 hp is a joke.<P>We are not the 2nd damage dealers. Hybrids are. Same weapon skill and spells! Paladins have GREAT weapons *give a warrior a gb and see what happens* and rangers have some dd's to toss in.<P>Oh and we get disarm at 35 not 36.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Seeing that monks only get half the hps a warrior get, and don't get the ac that diminishes damage taken, don't get the resistances warriors have, well, hell, monks only do one thing meelee wise better than you.  That's deal damage. Other than that they also get their last skill at 35, and yes, their skills cap a little higher than you, but seeing that they are skill dependent while warriors are equipment dependent it would seem unfair for warriors' skills to be in par with a monk AND have all the great armor they do.  Deal with it, all meelee classes after 35 don't have anything else to look forward but skill raises until about 40 or so.<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Uh, yeah.<P>Sorry, but the Ashenbone Hammer is cool and all but it's dropped by a GOD.<P>Also it uses 2 hand blunt as a skill.  The next best 2HB that a warrior can use is the Gatorsmash Maul -- 30 damage, *70* delay?  I don't think so.<P>Even citing the Ashenbone Hammer as an example of a warrior weapon is dumb.  It's super rare, you have to kill a god to get it, it's a member of a class of weapons that only gnome warriors would even bother to get skill in.  Perhaps not even then.<P>Citing it in a "life after 40" thread is even dumber, since the length of time between making level 40 and getting your Ashenbone Hammer is likely to be somewhere between 3 months and never, leaning towards never.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Okay,<P>Know one can squash melee arguments better than I. I've played all 3 into the 40s.<P>I was very upset that my warrior didn't get skills passed 40th level.  At first.  But, the FIRST time you get a better weapon, it is FAR better than getting a new skill.  This is the warrior's balance.  The warrior lives by his equipment.  A monk does not.  Therefore, the monk's damage and atk naturally go up, BUT, the warrior gets new Swords, hammers, axes, etc.  This, to me, is MUCH better and this is the reason I quit playing my "boring" monk.  Yes, the monk does more damage, but, I like being in the middle of the action, taunting, and doing good damage still.<P>All the extra dual wield means is that they attack MORE often.  That is it.  They cant upgrade their weapons really, but when a warrior does, it is a HUGE difference.  Sure, he may be virtually the same from 41 to 44, but AS SOON as he gets that NEXT BIG SWORD, he is a whole new can of whoop-ass.  Monks cant say this, but they understand it and accept it on the basis that it has its downsides as well.  Warrior's have to camp to get their goods, but it pays off. Monks just naturally get it (for the most part), and it is better overall for the monks (in terms of damage), but there isn't the "pride" or the excitement involved of looting that prized weapon.<P>With the latest patch, I think monks are right where they should be. Doing MUCH more damage than warriors, unless the warrior has 1 of 3 weapons (even then, they still do more, but not as much more).  Monks have been needing this for a while.  Forget about the skills.  They could tell you your skills go up (and lie), and you would be happy and not even know the difference.

Power is measured in many ways, but what you bring to a group and the "role" you play in that group is the most important I think.<P>At the later levels, you are a DoT that just happens to shield others so they can do the REAL damage.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  I dont see a problem with that.  People concentrate on "just damage" too much.  Look at enchanters and clerics.  They do VERY LITTLE Damage, but yet, they are one of the most "powerful" classes in the game.  *shrug*<P>Pezz Kneecrusher</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>1) Warriors do get better abilities in combat after 40. You just dont see it. Verant stated that chance of hitting and damage done is not simply skill based.

</FONT><HR>About monks having less hp than warriors... yes, its true. But counting base hps doesnt really make any sense. You need to count them after standard buffs have been applied. After you have gotten your pinzarn, resolution, altuna and stamina (and you probably use a pair of 5 AC, 55 HP rings too) a monk should get about 2200-2300 hps while a warrior should get about 2800-3000 hps depending on race. There is still a great difference, but monks certainly have more than half the hps in most situations. But the real point is that monks can FD pull, something that is needed if you are going to pull in most high level situations (ever heard of a warrior pulling in the planes or on a FG run?). Warriors, however, can do something monks cannot hope to do -- tank.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>So now you want to nerf all caster types?<P>You just don't understand do you...  <P>Verant is about balance.  They balance everything against everything else.  If they remove the skill limit cap then you will be more effective in combat.  If you are more effective then they have to raise the mob difficulty to restore balance.  If mobs hit harder and more often against you because of this then they will hit EVEN harder and EVEN more often against non-melee types also.  So instead of your wizard getting beat down in 15 seconds he will die in 8 seconds.  Raising the caster caps wont help because they will still be so far below the mobs that they will get demolished nearly as fast anyway (maybe 10 seconds in the above example).<P>Any raise to the melee skill limits makes casters weaker by far.  Maybe they could have done something differently a year ago to make this work, but by now it is a death warrant for any casters should raises take place outside of the expansion.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>If that was the case, why can some classes solo into the higher levels and others cannot?  Why was it stated (either Brad or Gordon, can't remember at the present) that "melee classes were not meant to be able to solo".  In that case, what's balanced about that?  Why should one class be able to solo and another can not?  I think all or none should be able to solo.  Personally, I think the game is much more worthwhile when you are in a group and most of the time I just log off if I can't get in one.<P>ICEtonester, you helped me realize something.  Melee characters are beginning to sound more and more like a casters "pet".  We try to keep the mobs off the casters with damage/taunting and take damage for the casters.  All we have to do now is say, "Sorry master, calming down."  Oh well, somebody has to do it.  Casters can't always use there rent-a-tank pets, even though they are "arguably" able to fight as well as or better than most melee types.  Especially when the caster can throw a few buffs on them and give them some weapons.<P>Galwen D'Vaxton of Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Heh,<P>Well, I guess in a sense, we ARE a caster's pet...much the same way a cleric is our bandaid, and we are a cleric's shield, and much the same way that a caster is our sword.  Its all about dependancy.  Yes, some classes depend on others more than some classes, but this has always been the case with melee classes.  If you "melee", then you risk getting hurt.  Casters are great, because they aren't IN MELEE, but if they are in melee (mess up or whatever), they die. Pure and simple.<P>Pezz Kneecrusher</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I hate to tell you this but caster do not die just because they are in melee..Have you ever seen a necro in lower guk? Iv personally held the sage and savant rooms by myself fighting up to 3 froggies at time, including those damn wizards. I always win they always lose. And yes at least 1 or 2 of them are on me swinging away. <BR>We die when level 50+ mobs aggro on us and wont come off and this is if Harms shield is not up and FD didnt work. But most melees we survive just fine.<BR>However i do love having tanks around in large groups like in SolB or Ghoul lord or king room in guk. After all thats an extra 2000+ hp my necro has between him and death  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> hehe. <BR>At least i always Pact my tanks!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <BR>dont feel bad warriors the game would suck without ya! i have a 30th level tank. I know your pain. WHY OH WHY cant we bind tanks in dungeons! stupid Vision(tm)!<BR>I imagine you get some pretty cool skills/abilities in expansion.<P>Also if you warriors havent grouped with high level necros. do it. our pact line is a real bonus for you guys and saves the cleric tons of mana. Every warrior i grouped with loves it when i add a 350pt buffer every 24 secs to them. almost always end fights at 80%+ health. My favorite group is 2 necros, 2 tanks, 1 shaman, 1 cleric. Very low down time if any at all.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
