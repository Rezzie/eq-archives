</FONT><HR>As an avid rogue, I feel that this thread is a horrendous ... blah ... to our class.  First, here's how pickpocket works:<P>Mob X has App, Bgp, Csp, and Dcp.  Assuming you have max pickpocket skill, the first pick gets A/2 pp and so on until A == 1.  Then, the same thing happens with B, C, and D.  Let's try real values:<P>3pp, 6gp, 1sp, 2cp<BR>PP1: 1pp<BR>PP2: 1pp<BR>PP3: 3gp<BR>PP4: 1gp<BR>PP5: 1gp<BR>PP6: 1cp<BR>PP will fail every time after this, and you will loot 1pp, 1gp, 1sp, and 1cp.<P>NOW - Rogues over level 15 that aren't IDIOTS (anyone over 15 has at least an ounce of sense) know very well not to PP in groups.  Mobs DO tell who PP's them, but only certain mobs...doesn't matter how green or how red, they will scream if you pull a bad PP, it depends only on the mob type (dervishes will, but orcs won't).<P>Next, I haven't seen a single rogue that hasn't cleared with his group before PP'ing OR that hasn't shared.  I only PP when solo, when with another rogue in a group of two, or when I'm with a group of good friends that is clear with me PPing.  I HAVE PP'd before in a group where they nearly get me killed (all, not just one), blame it on me for not bacstabbing more (when they don't even see it misses), and are basically bad players ... naturally, this is right before I quit the group, so the PP doesn't affect the loot barely at all.<P>And YES - PP does take from the normal loot tables.  For the above reasons it shouldn't matter much.  YES it should get changed back.  NO, don't not group with rogues because of their PP skill, the gp/sp/cp that they can pickpocket is NOT GOING TO MATTER in the end ... it's a VERY small amount and I've NEVER been rich as a rogue.  If you don't group with a rogue for RP reasons, that's one thing, but if it's because they PP and you're afraid that will take too much money away from YOUR greedy self, that's wrong.  Rogue damage output and reliability far outweighs anything that you may THINK is bad...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Quit *****in about pickpocket. Like we really get so much. The other night in Sol B I pickpocketed a mezzed Kobold to taunt it a bit and got 17 copper. Now I'm pretty sure the group wouldn't be too angry about something that trivial. It's a useful skill till about 30 then it just sucks. So if you really need to avoid rogues till 30 go for it but after that you may wanna change your mind becuse not too many high lvl rogues steal.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Though I appreciate your concern nyrulz, it's a little known fact that a rogue cannot pickpocket the last coin of any type off of a creature.  This means that if the creature is spawned with 1g3s5c, the most the rogue can pickpocket is 2s4c.  He can't get the gold. <P>That said, I wouldn't let a bad experience with one member of a class taint your feeling towards grouping with that class. Rogues, like everyone else, are played by people on the other side of keyboard, who can be either nice or jerks regardless what class they play.<P>-Gordon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I think it's unfair that us Rogues get a bad rap because of people using Pick Pocket in a group. I know that some characters are in the adventuring thing for nothing but the money, but I on the other hand do it for the kicks.<P>I know that people have a short fuse when it comes to money, and here is how :<P>My Rogue is a very mischevious fellow, and he likes to use his hide/sneak very often to keep in practice. One of the things I like to do is, while hiding,  give an emote that I am going through someones pockets, and sometimes I steal a silver or two.<P>I am totally amazed that people actually think it is real, and even better want to duel me or argue with me about silver!!<P>Then when they give me a tell, saying "Give that back you thieving @$@#%$#^!" I simply respond "You must have mistaken me for someone else, Players can't steal from other players." <P>The point I'm trying to make here is, this is above all a game, so have fun. If the Rogue wants to steal from the MOBs and not tell you, is that a reason to be suspcious of every theif? All for a couple of silvers???  <P>The game is about leveling, as well as money, or so I thought. Besides what are you gonna do with all that silver anyway?? At high levels most people give it away or drop it...<P>Blackivar<BR>10 Halfling Rogue<BR>Druzzil Ro server  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Using your logic, I technically should never group with ANYONE, because at some point in my EQ-life, I have grouped with an ass from every single class.<P>Few rogues use their pick pocket skill. Why? Because it is pretty useless. a handful of coppers/silvers isn't worth the risk of losing a group. Also, you should know that there is a risk of getting caught, in which case the mob will yell, "Stop thief! &lt;Lysithea&gt;"<P>Unless your in a light-hearted group, this useually spells your explusion from the party and a nasty stream of /shouts proclaiming your thievery.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Not nice.   You're blaming rogues as a whole based on one persons actions.  I never pp in group or other peoples pulls even when I solo.  It's not the class that has the problems you experienced.  It's the person on the other end who's the problem and if you played with them when they were playing anything else they would be just as bad and arrogant.  Fortunately I'm in a guild with a good rep so I do get groups ok.  Just ok.

</FONT><HR>I hate to argue this point further, but there is indeed a bug in your rogue pickpocketing code.<P>You are very correct when you say that at least 1 coin of every type is remaining on the mob when it dies if the rogue pickpockets it.  That is true.<P>However, where your bug is is in the looting of the mob.<P>Lets say that you have a group of 3, one rogue.<P>The rogue pickpockets the mob down to 1pp 1g 1s 1c.<P>Whoever in the group loots that mob will get all of the loot because it can't be divided by 3.  The only way the group would get even money is if there were 3pp 3g 3s and 3c.  This is a huge bug in your code.<P>If you're in a group of 6, if a mob doesn't carry 6pp, and you have one looter, the rest of the group will NEVER get a plat if the total plat on the mob is less than 5.<P>This is why, if you watch, groups all play with lootsplit OFF and take turns looting.<P>In my group of 3 the other day, with one designated looter used (because he could carry the heavy weapons looted) with lootsplit ON, he had gotten well over 34p more than the rest of the group due to your lootsplit coding bug.<P>So, to get back on topic, a rogue can FORCE the lootsplit to not split fairly and by looting the corpse beforce anyone else, get the major majority of the money off of the mob due to the logic of your lootsplit code.<P>The only way to fix this is to pool the money (IE 1p 1g 1s 0c becomes 1110c which is then divided by group members total and then converted into proper coinage to reduce weight.)  Or, remove lootsplit all together, but I guarentee, playing a rogue, I can get WAY more money than the rest of my group and furthermore by playing a warrior and saying, "I'll loot everything because I can carry it" I can use the poor lootsplit bug to my advantage and make over 10 times more pp than the rest of my group in a given day.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

When we group we take turns looting.  If the rogue needs to practice PPing, then he can PP every mob he wants on HIS loot turn.  That is the appropriate way to have them "practice" and the group members still getting their fair share of loot.

</FONT><HR>I don't care for the common loot pool either.  I don't think any Rogue does, at least those of us who've been around awhile.  They changed it around 10-12 months ago, I believe around the same time they gave us a higher Resist Poison stat.  No one noticed at first - we didn't have Abashi writing the Patch messages back then - but once we caught on....<P>At first, of course, they denied it.  Well, Abashi denied it;  I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he was lied to as well... he was still rather new to the position, and their attitude towards the customers was already becoming pretty negative.  We complained for months about it to no avail - and believe it or not the Rogues were the most vocal.  We tried, they didn't listen.  So don't blame the Rogues... it's a Skill that actually works (don't get us started), and it's what we do.  And since it's still an active Skill I can only assume it's 'as designed', so no one can complain and no one can be warned/banned for doing it.<P>All I'd like to know - the question that was never reasonably answered back then - is what was so wrong with the skill that it had to be changed in this way?  There were other options - arguably better options - so I think we finally realized that this was just the simplest to program;  don't know if that was ever acknowledged by Abashi.  Apparently the skill was checked against the MOBs 'loot table' every time Pick Pockets was clicked, rather than just once;  there was never a seperate 'loot pool'.  Assumptions, yes, but reasonable ones given the evidence;  thus, we were getting tons of cash off low level critters.<P>Why couldn't they program in a seperate loot pool for Pick Pockets?  Maybe it was too much work for the benefit returned.  Or maybe they were overly concerned about the economy and didn't like the extra cash flowing in.  Either way, I doubt it will be changed again - it doesn't have to be.  However, if they're willing to consider changing it back (Dare I say it... Fixing the Skill?), we can give them all sorts of reasonable options.<P>The most reasonable option I've seen - and arguably better than the current setup due to 'thievery' issues - is to increase the reset delay on it to something similar to Forage;  significantly reduces the chance of multiple hits during a single combat, so a seperate 'loot table' check wouldn't be near as big an issue.  Then they could return it to the previous arrangement, and the 'economy' would not be seriously affected;  all the new 'money sinks' considered do compensate, and many people past the mid-20s destroy silver and copper anyway.  Also, since we cannot pick 'tagged' items (Magic and No Drop, not sure about Lore), if possible the skill check could remove those types of items from the loot table.<P>I doubt Abashi will check this thread again... not the type of issue he generally comes back to.  So, if I don't see a response by Monday I might post a seperate thread.  Feel free to bring up the issue and quote me (or any other good ideas) if you want to start a thread of your own on this issue.<P>Thanks for listening.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Needless to say, I was taking tons more damage than he was and really busting my butt to make his job easier because it benefits the whole group. <P>So what do I find out several hours later? That he's been pickpocketing ALL the mobs. This got me highly upset. Why would a rogue want to steal things from his own party, especially when that party is there to PROTECT him? Sure, in character, theives are supposed to be underhanded, etc. But let's remember that this is a game, and rogues have to rely on other players to help them be effective. It's absolutely disgusting for a rogue player to OOCly cheat his party out of loot. Because that's exactly what he did. And yes, the guy who did it in my group was bragging about it, and couldn't understand why we were all upset.<P>I've asked before for Verant to please please put in a message that says "Soandso pickpocketed 1s 2c from a kobold scout." This should be broadcast AT LEAST to the group, if not to everyone in the surrounding area. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hmm... oh joy, here comes the rogue bashing again. Hopefully it will at least make the recent wave of annoying rogue twinks go away...<P>Anyway... I play a rogue as my primary character. He's level 45 right now, and his pickpocket skill is a lovely 200. I pickpocket all the time, in pretty much every group I'm in. No one ever complains because no one ever notices - I am not foolish enough to pick mobs dry, I am not foolish enough to talk about my pickings. For the most part, people cannot see a difference.<P>Because I have some scruples, I generally don't loot corpses after a group has finished killing something. I think that evens loot out pretty well. Some people ask me why I don't loot (I generally give an excuse), others seem to understand immediately... and everyone seems ok with having me in their group.<P>There are a lot of things to understand when you group with a rogue. If all you worry about is the few gold or silver, or the random pp, that he or she is going to pick during the fight, then by all means don't group with a rogue. But if you can look past the immediate gratification of a single kill's loot, you'll notice that you can kill things a lot faster with a good rogue around - in the end you'll most likely end up with more loot. Is it better to get a full 4pp from one kill, or 3pp each from 2 kills in the same time span?<P>There are other reasons to group with rogues now, as well. Once you hit lvl 35 or 40, platinum become pretty useless unless you have it in blocks of 1000. You need items of value to trade for the equipment you covet... and a great many of those items are behind locked doors, some of which have no keys. Good luck getting to that stuff if you refuse to group with rogues. "Oh no, we don't want that rogue, he might steal one pp per kill from the froggies! Ok, now how do we get into this crypt place?"<P>But no, those arguments are dumb aren't they? Nothing is important other than the money rogue can steal! Don't group with them! And just hope you don't ever get stuck with your corpse in the bottom half of Sebilis...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Sorry, but that arguement doesn't hold water. ANY party member you add to a party is going to increase the amount of mobs you kill and therefore increase loot. It's just that rogues are the only ones who can OOCly cheat their group out of loot. <P>If a wizard in my party started picking up corpses out of loot order, I'd toss him out of the party. Period. Because he'd be stealing loot from everyone else. And that's what rogues are doing when they pickpocket. This is something that goes beyond the IC personalities of rogues. I don't see any reason why rogues should be allowed to OOCly steal loot from their own parties and others. It's worse than ninja looting, because at least you can tell when someone ninja loots a corpse. As it is, non-rogues have no way of knowing that they're being robbed blind. I think it creates a very unfair situation in the game whereby one class can take advantage of others' ignorance to effectively ninja loot corpses. I call that unbalancing. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

At my level most people dont care anything about loot unless it is a valuable item, or magic. Coin means very little, and whoever is near it just loots. If you want money, stand up and loot one, that easy.<P>Anyhow, in the end, if you are so selfish and greedy that you cannot stand the thought that a rogue may pickpocket some of what you percieve to be your money, then by all means, dont ever group with us.

Fact is a rogue CAN take from you and from other party members.

</FONT><HR>Solice, I am not "increadibly [sic] low level." My highest level character is level 28. Unfortunately, I don't usually have 16 hours a day to devote to playing Everquest. I have a bunch of other characters, too. I've been playing EQ since the day it went live.<P>You may say that high-level players don't care about money loot, and that may or may not be true, but the fact is that the *vast majority* of Everquest's players are at lower levels where money DOES still matter. When you're hunting mobs that drop 5gp on average, having 4gp stolen from a mob before it turns into a corpse is a very big deal. <P>Not all of us have thousands of plats worth of loot and money to throw around. So please don't take a cavalier attitude towards money just because you happen to be lucky enough not to be concerned with it. Besides which, I note that it's somewhat entertaining to be told I'm overly concerned with loot by a player who plays a character capable of garnering money very easily. For the rest of us, it's quite a lot more difficult coming by the measely 800 plats necessary to buy a piece of quest armor or a decent weapon. In order to make any money at all, we HAVE to be concerned with whether or not we're being robbed blind. (FYI, I have now 500 plats in the bank. It's the most money I've had so far on my level 28 character. It's taken me a painfully long time to save up that much money.)<P>As I said before, I'm very much interested in seeing Verant change the pickpocket skill to include a message to nearby players that the rogue in question has pickpocketed a particular amount of cash. They instituted a loot announcement to other party members to encourage fairness, I fail to see why pickpocketing should be overlooked, considering that the same situation arises. Point is, we just can't trust rogues. And until I can trust a rogue (by being able to see how much he's pickpocketing), I'm probably just not going to group with one. There are plenty of places to hunt that don't require a rogue.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

This was the case even before the loot messages were implemented.<P>With my lvl 23 Ench, the typical looting arrangements, on Saryn, are called "Casual loot".  Bascially, take what you want just don't be a hog.  Some players turn on autsplit, others don't, and even a few ask for everyone to turn autsplit off.<P>Both cases are done on the honor system.  You have to put a good deal of trust in the other group members, beleiving that they aren't intentionally taking more than there "fair share" of the loot.  This trust is really tested, especially in nosplit loots, when you get a string of mobs that drop silver and copper, followed by 3 or 4 mobs that drop plat.  Can someone please explain to me who it isn't possible to trust a Rogue to not pick a mob clean, yet at the same time trust every other player do the right thing regarding looting?<P>I think the people who want to see a PP message, don't want it in the interest of "fairness" but are looking for something to get angry about.  Give them a message they can point to, and they can then turn, IMHO, a minor irritation into a serious issue, much like inspecting other players or the Enchanter spell "Sentinal".<P>Who knows, if we do get PP messages, maybe we can pressure Verant to make pickpocketing a violation of PnP, and a banbable offense.<P><BR>Just as a matter of showing where I'm coming from, that 500p, that Lucy says is the most she's ever had in the bank, is about 150p more than I've ever had, even with my lvl 35 Enchanter (the best I've done is 300 to 350 plat.) and all three characters I have are untwinked.

</FONT><HR>In summary:<P>1.  Rogues can pickpocket.  It is a skill unique to them.<P>2.  Rogues make some money pickpocketing.  Most do some PPing to keep the skill maxed.  Others do it to build up a collection of gold.<P>3.  No rogue can pickpocket a monster clean.  If you loot a monster and get no coins, it is either because your party member beat you to it (and had split off), or because the monster had no coins.<P>4.  If you consistently get 1 coint of each type when looting, and there is a rogue nearby, you might have a heart-to-heart talk with him or her.<P>5.  The only valuable items that Rogues can pickpocket are things like high-level spells and gems.  They can NEVER pickpocket an item with the 'MAGIC' tag turned on.<P>6.  Unlike other classes, Rogue 'quest' armor is dropped, not quested.  My feeling is that Verant intentionally did this to help 'free up' left over currency being held by those with quick hands.<P>7.  Most Rogues are played by human beings.  If you suspect one of 'over' practicing PP, then gently, but firmly, remind them to only take their fair share.  If they continue, talk to your party leader and decide whether or not to keep them in the party.<P>The rogue class is very handy in sticky situations, so I dare say no one should dismiss it out of hand.  If you find yourself not trusting the rogue in your party, it is time for communication.  Painting all rogues with the same brush requires an enormously large brush.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Lucy,<BR>The argument holds more water than you know. The only other character class with the potential to accelerate a groups kill rate as much as a rogue is a wizard (at least that's been my experience). We do a ludicrous amount of damage, assuming we know what we are doing. There are always people who will accept us in groups because of that fact - if you're not one of them, that's fine. Don't group with rogues. But don't ask for nerfs, that's bad form. <P>I don't tink it's right that an enchanter can KS virtualy anyone in the game with mem-blur. To make mem-blur fair, I think enchanters should lose exp every time they use it. Is it fair of me to want your abilities nerfed? Does the fact that I personally don't like the way that ability works warrant a nerf?<P>As to the money, and the fact that it is (arguably) valuable at low levels, and you don't want a rogue to steal all of it but one coin... At levels where money is useful, no rogue will ever be able to pickpocket a non-green mob to that point. Is or her skill will not be high enough, the success rate will be too low, and the number of coins picked will be too low. So don't worry about them taking all your money.<P>I just recommend that everyone group with rogues. Don't worry if they're pickpocketing or not. Don't ask them. Some will, some won't... you won't know which ones are and which aren't, I guarantee it.<P>And just to break down an EQ urban legend a bit - rogues don't get rich from picking pockets. I'm the only one on this thread who has admitted to regularly picking pockets, so I should be the only one who knows - the most money I've ever had at one time was 2800 plat. At level 45, I have about 500 plat in the bank. I know clerics, enchanters, shaman, and wizards (pretty much a member of every class granted the ability to solo farm in one way or another) who can't remember a time when they didn't have 10K platinum in the bank. So if the idea of a rogue getting rich is what galls you, stop worrying - we aren't.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Actually the most a rogue can pickpocket is 1s3c in Abashi's scenario...  The remaining coins are destroyed.  (if a creature has an odd number of coins that number is divided by two then rounded down the extra coin is destroyed making the amount on the corpse an even number)  A little known fact about rogues pick pocketing loot that comes off the actual corpse is that it didn't always happen and that we never really wanted to, we liked it just fine before Verant changed.  *sigh* there's always realism to be considered...  Anyways just wanted to set the record straight.<P>And I will die if I think that for an instant it will save one of my team members.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

We live and die by it.  It's hard as hell already to get groups, and worse being up against this kind of thing.

In Lower Guk it's irrelevant anyway... In Cazic, the loot is primarily words and pocket change. I go to a group with no money in my inventory, and I generally split my loot when I go. I hand words over, generally without even being asked. I don't even roll on items that other people NEED to upgrade their equipment. I'm told I have a good aura =) and people never regret grouping with me.<P>Other than that, I'm a rogue. In the best sense. I'm unpredictable, elusive, and I watch my back. I certainly do my best to acquire loot that is open for claim, or roll for things that I can't personally use if not required by a group member.<P>It is strange that rogues - all of whom I have grouped with, in any rate, which would be most rogues in between level 20 and 50 on Bristlebane - follow a similar set of guidelines. Occasional fits of kleptomania occur, especially when a competing group has a fit of kill-stealing, or someone develops more arrogance than their experience and expertise can justify.<P>I'm tired of people misjudging rogues on the basis of their own greed.
