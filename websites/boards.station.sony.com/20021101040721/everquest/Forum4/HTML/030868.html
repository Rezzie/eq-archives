This spell is what makes rangers what they are, the best pullers/peelers in the game! This spell is why rangers hunt outdoor zones, and why people want rangers to group with them in zones like MM. If it is true that this spell only works on non-experience giving MOBs, then my favorite character has just lost his appeal. As the owner of five accounts, spending over $60 a month in fees, and owning piles of luclin expansion disks, I would like to know if Verant is trying to lose customers or if they just do not know what we want. I've seen lots of patch messages with nerfs of spells from other classes too, and I'm sure they feel the same way. It seems that V cares more about their MOBs than they do about their customers. just my 2 cents... </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I play a ranger who is level 54 now and I did not get there casting harmony on everything. In fact I rarely use the spell. Rangers are fast, efficient damage dealers as well as pullers. I do think myself a good puller, but harmony is not the cause of it. Peeling? Don't have the need to do it as much in the higher lvls as most of the MT's I group with can hold aggro pretty good.  But if the need arises where we have multiple mobs, I can peel a mob off a caster in no time flat. Taunt, snare and root are my friends in that case. Snare will almost always make that mob do an about face with you hit em with it. I love playing my ranger and I continue to learn new things every day. Rangers have many abilities, so the Harmony "nerf" does not bother me one bit. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I come today bringing PROOF:<P>Cross posted from The Druid's Grove <P> <A HREF="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=29216.topic" TARGET=_blank>http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=29216.topic</A> <P>I've been following the threads here and on the Ranger's Glade about Harmony today and wanted to give some more information on the reasoning behind the change. <P>Harmony is the druid and ranger version of the lull line of spells. Several classes get these types of spells, with enchanters, bards, and clerics being the best at it overall. Lulls work by lowering the range at which monsters will attack you, allowing you to pull a single monster out of a group by lulling it's companions. <P>Traditionally, most lull spells haven't really worked very well. Lull had a high resist rate and wasn't very reliable. We've recently looked at lulls and improved the way they work to make them more useful to players. You should find that the lull line of spells works more often than it did, though it will still fail some of the time. <P>Harmony was unique in that when you cast it on an NPC, it never failed. This essentially means that Harmony could be used for risk-free pulling every time. All other lull spells have a resist check, allowing a monster to not be affected by them. The fact that Harmony can't be resisted made it the very best of the lull spells - which is an odd thing to happen to a level 5 spell. <P>We've had the ability for awhile now to make it so certain monsters were totally immune to being lulled. This is especially common in higher level outdoor zones such as Cazic-Thule, since Harmony would take any challenge out of splitting groups of monsters. Having a such powerful game dynamic with no risk of failure made these encounters too easy, so we were forced to make many monsters totally lull immune to compensate. With this change to Harmony, we'll now be able to remove the lull immunity from many monsters, and turn this ability into a useful spell line that gives great benefits, but with some risk that your spell may be resisted. <P>This week, we'll be adding an upgrade to Harmony that works on higher level monsters. We'll also be removing the lull immunity from many higher level monsters in outdoor zones, to accommodate the new spell. The higher level version of Harmony will have some chance of being resisted, but will be a fairly reliable way to split up groups of outdoor monsters. We do want this spell line to be a useful tool for you at all levels, but as with all other forms of crowd control there needs to be some chance that it won't always work. Druids and rangers should get a excellent outdoor lull, but a level 5 spell probably shouldn't be the best it ever gets. <P>- Rich</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Any monkey with harmony can single pull easily - it's not that hard a concept...<P>Rangers are not the best pullers - The best pullers have FD...  Rangers are are great outdoors, BUT they're not the best.  Let me put it another way:  what happens when the mob you're trying to pull hits another harmonied mob and you get both?  Monk / SK can FD - what can you do to control a bad pull?  Snare and hope you outrun it?<P>I know all about pulling, and am one of the best pullers I know - Playing a 50+ monk and a 50+ ranger really helped...  I personally don't think there are too many pullers that can pull a summoning mob fully across a zone (like I was pulling guardian wurms in SF the other day) with no adds...<P>But the end result is this:  Monks/Shadow Knights have tools to eliminate bad pulls...  Rangers don't - they only have tools to hinder a bad pull (which sometimes (like in KC) isn't enough...)<P>Lol Otto - you're right...  Let me rephrase - not many monks can do that..   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

It can be done by many classes, some are better at it then others. But a couple key notes about a truly great puller is one that can produce just enough agro to get the mob back to his group without it being stolen by other while also not producing to much agro as to make it harder for the main tank to take over. It is also the case that a great puller takes the least amount of damage possible. A puller that is almost dead when he returns to a group because of the damage received is a quick way to get your healer killed. <BR>HP and AC are not necessary for a truly great puller.

Before the patch, we did not know a level limit existed for the spell. It had been know that some of the highest possible outdoor mobs could be harmonized so long as they were not specifically tagged as being immune to Harmony.<P>After the change, a respected ranger of the Ranger Glade who plays on the Test server reported that the limit was level 40 and higher mobs. As most of you know, the Test server received many of the changes before the Live servers do and can often still be up durning patch days of the Live server.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><I>Tyrellan-CT said</I><BR>Lol Lanys - You must not understand what it's like to pull on Luclin where some mobs ARE harmony proof... Any monkey with harmony can single pull easily - it's not that hard a concept...</font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Tyrellan, I do know what it is like to pulling Luclin. The mobs that are immune to harmony are known. The list of some of the mobs are: Dark Assassins, Dark Masters, Elysian Elders, Radir Firesomething, most owlbears. Most of these mobs can be single pulled without the use of Harmony by just knowing when to pull. <P>There are other mobs in Luclin which requires some technique more then waiting to pull and which are not immune to Harmony. Camps like the Chief camp in ME or most XTC camps require something more then just level or waiting until they are roaming alone to pull. They require a monk or SK functionality, an effect crowd control, or a skilled Harmonizing puller. The change removes the 3rd option in that list.<P>Finally, if Harmony is a monkey ability that requires no skill, what does that say about FD pulling or just pulling all the mobs and requiring an enchanter to mez? It can be said that any monkey run up and tag something, run away for a little bit, push a button, fall down and wait until their is only 1 mob left. <P>The truth of the matter is that while people can place Harmony on mobs, it still took knowledge and skill as to how to pull them. Harmony was no guarenty to single pulls. It looked like it was because those people brave enough to risk death usually knew what they were doing enough to pull successfully. Harmony pulling still required skills. The puller needed to know the agro range of his targets to even know they could be Harmony pulled. There were actually some mobs that where not immuned to Harmony yet could not be pulled with Harmony due to the fact that the agro range was larger then the spell casting range (eg. Ogre Chief in WK). Furthermore, it was often hard for people to know which mobs it landed on since the effects did not often show up at maximum casting range. Harmony pulling was not a brain-dumb skill.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><I>Tyrellan-CT said</I><BR>I know all about pulling, and am one of the best pullers I know - Playing a 50+ monk and a 50+ ranger really helped... I personally don't think there are too many pullers that can pull a summoning mob fully across a zone (like I was pulling guardian wurms in SF the other day) with no adds...</font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>This is easy. Unless you do damage to the guardian wurms, they will not summon. I have done it many times before. In fact, almost all mobs that can summon will not summon until you do damage. So if you pull them without doing damage (ie. use spells like snare or jolt), you can pull them with ease. <P>If you want a difficult pull, you need to discribe wizard casting pulls. That is diffucult pulls. Wizards mobs cast more often then any other type of mobs in the game. As soon as they can cast, they will cast. Furthermore since Kunark add that was dubbed the "anti-kitting" code, if the distance between the mob and the puller exceeds a certain range, the mob will no longer follow. That range is usually just a little longer then  casting distance of wizard type mobs. This means that the puller must stay in casting range of the wizard (taking damage for which AC does not matter) in order to pull it. Pullers often use terain features and obsticals to remove the LOS of spells while still staying in casting range of these mobs when they pull them. That is a difficult pull, not pulling summoning mobs.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><I>Tyrellan-CT said</I><BR>But the end result is this: Monks/Shadow Knights have tools to eliminate bad pulls... Rangers don't - they only have tools to hinder a bad pull (which sometimes (like in KC) isn't enough...)</font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Which in a way means a good Ranger puller can actually have a bit more skill then most monk pullers. That does not mean they are the best pullng class but rather maybe the best "puller". If a ranger is able to pull without making a mistake because they do not have escape tactics, would that not be better then a monk that can just say "Oh well, I will FD and try again"?<P>BTW, a good ranger puller makes a better puller in KC then monks or SKs. Monk and SK pulling is essentually a "controlled train". That is they cause a small train to an area and then pull the last mob in that train to leave. Successful ranger pulling does not produce a train. And like any train, controlled or not, it can be inherited by others who do not necessarily want that train. <P>In KC with its design of a single pulling path, controlled trains can be easily inherited. Especially, if the rest of the zone is not patient enough or is not completely aware of where the other monk/SKs are at the time.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><I>Quiw said</I><BR>Hrm, an AE unresistable aggro-reducing spell gained at level 5/22 that affected all levels was changed. /bonk</font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>A part of the traits of Harmony is left out of that. It should be "An AE unresistable agro-reducing spell gained at level 5/22 that affects all levels in ONLY outdoor zones that have not been tagged as not allowing the spell against mobs that are not IMMUNE and where pathing is stable enough to not allow them to touch each other and where their spawn location makes it so they are not touching each other and where the caster can see the entire body of the target". <P>That last one is the funny part about Harmony. Harmony is one of those spells that seems to be a bit more then Line of Sight spells. Spells that are LOS and can be casted on mobs does not necessarily mean that Harmony can be casted on them. You see, a change that was made back in 1999 when the game was new and people were just learning how to use Harmony made it so that you had to just about see the entire body of the mob you are casting on in order for it to work. It was restricted more so then any other LOS spell on LOS issues.<P>At the end of this post, I will link in a guide that was made on this board by Sinnad about some of the details on Harmony. It should help.<P>----------------<P>Now, I would like to make a few commits directly towards the post that DataOutlaw quoted from a developer response to the complaints against the Harmony change. For those of you that do not know who made the quote that DataOutlaw made, it was made on the Druids Grove by a Jahaar which is the psuedo name there for Rich Waters, I believe.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">I've been following the threads here and on the Ranger's Glade about Harmony today and wanted to give some more information on the reasoning behind the change.</font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Eventhough I believe that the Newbie Zone is not necessarily the place for this, he makes this statement even after the first post on this zone was deleted. Granted, the first post may not have had a place here. I am not going to argue that point. What I am going to say is that I wonder about the case of watching the theads on boards for which he does not have the power to delete after the one on a board they do have the power was deleted. If concern about the opinions on this change were a factor, why delete some of those concerns. That other post has not gotten into a flame feast. Some of it was a whine, sure, but not all of it.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">Harmony is the druid and ranger version of the lull line of spells. Several classes get these types of spells, with enchanters, bards, and clerics being the best at it overall. Lulls work by lowering the range at which monsters will attack you, allowing you to pull a single monster out of a group by lulling it's companions.</font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>This is partually true. Harmony is a lull type spell. But it has one major difference the all the other lull spells. Harmony works in only certain outdoor tagged zones. Lull works in all zones. Sure, some lull work on only special type mobs (ie. animal lulls or undead lulls) but there is not restrict to the zones. If the zone is indoor and an undead mob exists, lull undead works. If it is outdoor and undead, lull undead works.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">Traditionally, most lull spells haven't really worked very well. Lull had a high resist rate and wasn't very reliable. We've recently looked at lulls and improved the way they work to make them more useful to players. You should find that the lull line of spells works more often than it did, though it will still fail some of the time.</font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>From what I have seen and read, the resist reduction is no more then the reduction in all resists after the change to all the resists. While it may be true that lulls was looked at specifically, it is hard to tell. There is a reduction in the resist rates to lull spells, but it is nothing larger then the total reduction in resists that was granted across the board after the changes to resist recently went into affect.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2"><BR>Harmony was unique in that when you cast it on an NPC, it never failed. This essentially means that Harmony could be used for risk-free pulling every time. All other lull spells have a resist check, allowing a monster to not be affected by them. The fact that Harmony can't be resisted made it the very best of the lull spells - which is an odd thing to happen to a level 5 spell.</font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>It was not completely as risk-free pulling as he is making it out to be. When you had someone that knew what they were doing, it sure looked risk free. But you still had to work with things like LOS issues, not being sure it affected what you thought it affected, the fact that it did not work if the mobs were touching. What he is meaning is that it only had the risk of its resist removed. But that being said, one question. Is it not the case that the "risk-free" aspect of Harmony still exists for a specific section of mobs? <P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">We've had the ability for awhile now to make it so certain monsters were totally immune to being lulled. This is especially common in higher level outdoor zones such as Cazic-Thule, since Harmony would take any challenge out of splitting groups of monsters. Having a such powerful game dynamic with no risk of failure made these encounters too easy, so we were forced to make many monsters totally lull immune to compensate. With this change to Harmony, we'll now be able to remove the lull immunity from many monsters, and turn this ability into a useful spell line that gives great benefits, but with some risk that your spell may be resisted.</font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Ah. I thought it was a case that they had the ability to make certain mobs totally immune to Harmony, not necessarily immune to lull type spells. Furthermore, I thought it was also the case that they had the ability to make Harmony not work in specific zones (ie. Plane of Air while being an outdoor zone (SOW works) does not allow the use of Harmony).<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">This week, we'll be adding an upgrade to Harmony that works on higher level monsters. We'll also be removing the lull immunity from many higher level monsters in outdoor zones, to accommodate the new spell. The higher level version of Harmony will have some chance of being resisted, but will be a fairly reliable way to split up groups of outdoor monsters. We do want this spell line to be a useful tool for you at all levels, but as with all other forms of crowd control there needs to be some chance that it won't always work. Druids and rangers should get a excellent outdoor lull, but a level 5 spell probably shouldn't be the best it ever gets.</font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Here is the key. They have a powerful spell given to druids at level 5 and rangers at level 22 for which is now only works until they fight with level 40+ mobs. The next step of spell for which they plan to place in the game at a higher level will be weaker in a major component then the pervious spell. That is to say that while the lower spell worked without resists, the higher level spell will not be resisted. Higher is not always better, I guess.<P>Furthermore while it was not clear as to the details of the new spell, it does leave some openings and room for assumptions. Will it be PoP spell only? Good question, especially after the patch said that the new raid stuff was placed in the game yet did not tell you that it only worked if you had PoP (I know, I tried to use it last night). <P>Secondly, what level will it be placed? Good question. Druids receive Harmony at level 5. Rangers receive the same spell at level 22. The level cap for Harmony is level 40. That means there is a good chance that by level 35, Harmony may be near its end of use to rangers. What level will they give it to druids and subsiqently give it to rangers at a latter time as all parent class spells are done with hybrids? Will it be in time to make it usefull to rangers before the old Harmony becomes useless?<P>Finally if it is now going to be resisted, is the restrictions on it still going to be the same? Good question. If it is going to be treated as a true fuctional lull type spell in that it can be resisted, will it receive the same lull type spell advantages? Will it be useable indoors? <P>----------------<P>In conclussion, I would like to stress one of my biggest points here. And I also would like to tell everyone I am sorry for writing such a long book. <P>As I said, Harmony was about the 3 strongest tool to the ranger class for pulling. The first being level. Second being knowledge. While rangers were not necessarily the "best" pulling class, they were a compenent alternative to the standard monk/SK pulling class. This can also be said for the druid class as an alternative to the standard pulling class. While the change to Harmony does not completely remove pulling ability from the ranger/druid class, it does reduce it a lot. It is a huge reduction in their pulling ability. <P>This reduction does make me wonder some what though. Why was it necessary to reduce the pulling ability of the 3 or 4th ranked pulling class? This stuff about lull spells does not really matter. Bards and clerics are not going to be major pullers for groups because they are more useful in other job roles that rangers are not capable of doing. Heck, druids do not as often pull for groups because they have more importent other job roles to preform. Traditionally, it has been the monk, SK, and ranger classes who pull for the most part. That does not mean they always do only that they are more likely to. This change greatly reduces the ability of a lower ranked class in that job function.

I tend to do this alot, not post, read all posts, then post a reply to everyone in general like. Take it offensive, I don't care. I just put things as they are.<P>On Druids and Harmony:<P>What the hell are you thinking. You are THE best soloist in the game (shut up necromancers, no matter what you say, a pet is not soloing, for solo means "alone", same with beastlords and magicians). You can kill... what is that... 4+ monsters at one time. Ok, if you are going to quad most of your life... this spell is useless. You don't quad with single pulls. You sow yourself. Snare has a quick cast time so you can drop it on any mob a screen length away (if you don't know what that means you could do better at quading if you did...). If you aren't quading... see you at level 60 when you are still 40.<P>On Rangers and Harmony:<P>First off most of your gear should have ac and agi on it. Agi adds ac, and gets you hit less. You deal damage fast + get hit less (if you get hit alot,  make an ogre warrior...). Root and snare should be quite enough for solo encounters and your own crowd contol.<P>on Druids AND Rangers on Harmony:<P>True, the above applies to the lower level mobs. But if you are pulling at a high level... you should be smacked. You should always have a group since the exp is better, and no one likes anti social people. And in every group there should be a Monk. I don't care who says what, i am a shadowknight at heart, and i know monks can FD pull better than me. hands down, any scenario, so i dont want you sks bitching to me about it. shut up, they are better. They dont need the hps to take hits, if they are good at FD, they won't be needing to take hits. Plus, if they are a smart monk they will have godlike AGI hence, get hit less anyway.<P>Glad you all took the time to read this, id you disagree with any of my statements, tough.
