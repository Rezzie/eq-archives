Primarily I’d like to focus on ‘balance’ issues, but I’m always open to other input as well. Just so you know, the only notes I have on clerics to date is:<P>---<P>Celestial Healing (and Elixer): This spell overwrites regeneration spells, causing them to need to be recast, and essentially adding the cost of those spells to the effective casting cost of Celestial Healing. This should probably not happen.<P>Celestial Healing and Celestial Elixer now stack with all regen spells, including Bear Form and Skin Like Nature. But it will not stack with Lich and other spells in that line. = fixed<P>---<P>So let’s hear it.<P>(I’ll probably start a Wizard Talk today as well, just so you know.

</FONT><HR>As a cleric I don't mind other classes being able to heal. Clerics will still be greatly desired. If you ever try to heal a tank in a heavy battle you will see why remedy just won't do it. And it never hurts to have other be able to do support healing.<P>I DO THINK that the clerics should get some form of curse line of spells (ie combat debuff or maybe dot) basically a form of reverse bless. If we can bless our friends we should also be able to curse our enemies.<P>Obviously not as good as a shamans debuffs or a druids dot but still useful.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

This is the place to ask for such help and when someone states an idea it's flamed. <P>Thank god I have a druid to play instead when they give druids and shaman clerical healing. I'll just keep my cleric camped (most people posting are ok with this) and play my druid who can offer much more to the group.<P>I do really feel bad for the people who "only" have a cleric to play and all I can say is that it sounds like a druid or shaman would make for a great new primary once you retire your cleric.<P>/ponder</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've already stated my ideas and opinion on Clerics. However, since these new "balances" made to the test server, i have a new opinion.<P>I'm going to make this short and sweet for you all:<P>After seeing the "improvements/balances" made to other classes, Cleric better recieve more than your leading us to believe or else you WILL, and i guarantee that with my life, you WILL see less people playing Clerics. Its not just the fact that Druids and Shaman have recieved better healing abilities, its ALSO because Druid and Shaman can do so, SO, much more. Everything Cleric's could look to to see why they are playing Clerics (i.e Healing and Rezzing) is being distributed to other classes. Sure Clerics can do it "better", their advantages are decreasing, and so will the number of Clerics.<P>All i'm hoping for is Clerics to recieve as "good balacing" as the other classes have recieve so far. Or Clerics WILL leave for the reasons i've stated.<P>-A concerned but hopeful Cleric</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Several things that I believe would help clerics, all I believe have been stated before by others, I am only throwing my support to these ideas along with why I think they are good/needed.<P>Temple Port<BR>This would port a cleric to the temple of their deity. It would be a self only port. This fits in nicely with the clerical type of role as well as giving the cleric a slight expansion of current ability. While I fully agree with the increase in healing ability for Shamans/Druids, clerics feel that ‘their’ domain has been taken from them with nothing in return. This simple port gives us something that is both very useful, yet doesn’t take anything from another class.<P>Prayer<BR>Clerics have asked many times for some type of self-mana regen as we are one of the few (if not only) casting class that doesn’t have it. I think Prayer would be a great way of giving it to clerics while keeping a ‘clerical’ flavor. IMHO it should work along the lines of a spell. The duration should be about 5 minutes with a 15 minute recast time, self only. I think a recast time of greater than 30 minutes would render the spell useless. During this time a 10 mana regen per tick would be in effect. During this time the cleric can move around, sit stand, etc. However, the act of casting a spell, any spell, would dispel the Prayer. Note that the recast time would still be in effect. This could greatly effect downtime (a much despised aspect of any game) while not affecting balance of the game during combat.<P>Group AC Buffs<BR>We have Heroic Bond, and later (I’m only 53rd level) a group Symbol. What happened to our group AC buff? Personally I think you would find very few clerics that would mind losing our incredibly useful ‘pet’ and having it replaced with a group AC buff. Again, this simplifies a clerics job by changing 6 casts to one, as well as saving a little mana.<P>Defense/Offense<BR>Seems there are a fair number of clerics that fall on both sides of this. Myself personally, I started a cleric because I enjoyed healing others, helping them do things they couldn’t do themselves. As such I’ve always seen myself in terms of defense, not offense. Because of that I personally don’t see a good reason for increasing the offensive capabilities of the cleric. I’m sure others disagree with that though. However, I do think that the defensive capabilities of a cleric could use some improvement. Because I don’t see us as the nimble tank jumping around avoiding blows, I don’t think this means an increase in the dodge capability of a cleric, but in the Defense skill. I think it should be raised from 175 to 200. I think this can also be justified as our Offense skill is at 200. Doesn’t make sense to me that the Defense skill should be lower.<P>Deity Specific<BR>I realize that you have stated that while this sounds like it would be wonderful for making the cleric class more interesting, it would be unlikely to be implemented at this late stage in the game. However, a suggestion on this. Currently the Dark Elves (I am one of them) have our 3 deity specific necklaces. Each one of these cast a different low level Necro type spell. While the spells themselves seldom have a usefulness in group situations, they stats of the necklaces are worthwhile. Beside, on more than one occasion the spell (Darkness) has come in useful. I always enjoy answering the question ‘How’d a cleric do that?” with ‘Well, I’m EVIL!” So while making true changes to clerics to reflect their deities might not be an option, please press the development team to complete the equivalent deity-specific type quests for the other clerics.<P>Well, these are some of the things that I’ve seen that I believe would be valuable to clerics. All of it is presented solely as my opinion though. Thanks for reading it.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>The backlash on the announced changes on test for Druids and Shamans mask the real problem here.  Those two classes need better heals, and most clerics will freely admit it.<P>The problem is that at high levels, clerics are already a vanishing breed on many servers.   This surely indicates a huge problem, does it not, given that most people agree that clerics are a "required" class?  By "clerics", btw, I mean people who have played a cleric as their primary character since they started.  They are fading away, and being replaced by "clerics" who are just powerlevelled alts in staggering numbers.<P>This doesn't seem to matter though anymore.  Why?  Because a cleric has become so one-dimenional in the high level game that anyone can play one.  Stuns, a cleric's best friend during the middle of their career, become increasingly useless at high levels.  Roots break on the first blast a majority of the time.  The role of a cleric as an all-out mitigator of damage is narrowing and narrowing to just casting the most efficient heal and sitting back down.<P>Many people are saying that clerics should be happy they are so needed for multi-group events.  The fact is, a large number of clerics *hate* multi-group events with a passion becasue they are *constantly* hounded to attend them, and this is why they are picking up alts and dropping their clerics.  The high level game is broken, and clerics and chanters are driven to distraction by the peer pressure applied to them to anchor every single guild event that occurs.  Say "raid" to a post-50 cleric and many hear this:  "every night, no exp, sit down, spend cash, rez us all, make the game fun for us because it's your job".<P>How do you fix this?  You have to add some variety for clerics, and you have to make single group activities much more prevalent and viable post-50th.  The class balancing only addresses the former, though, so let's talk about that.  These suggestions all go towards increasng the variety of the cleric's ability to protect their group.<P>1. Stun Command:  Verant was smart on this one...expand on it.  AE stuns are a perfect way to add variety to clerics without unbalancing anything.  Why?  Because if you are in a group AE stunning a pack of mobs and stop to heal, you will never get back in control long enough to start AE stunning again.  It's an either-or kind of role.  Add more AE stuns, with lower recast times and mana cost, at a wider range of levels, all somewhat less than the equivalent Enchanter line.  Infringing on Enchanters?  Barely; they have mez, clarity, haste buffs, slow, etc.  Heck, I know many chanters who rarely mem AE stuns at all and have never participated in a group doing primarily AE spells.<P>2. Evac to your own God's Temple:  create a single evac spell to one fixed location in the game, your chosen God's temple.  Save your group, but extremely limited travel applications, minimizing impact on druids and wizards.  Put the entire group under rez effects when this is used if you want to balance it further.<P>3. Examine what mobs are immune to stun at high levels.  There are too many that are.  This was a cheap way to make mobs tougher to beat without improving the AI, but in effect you narrowing the roles of the classes with stuns.  Fix this.<P>4. Fear line...with Dread of Night clerics were reduced from having a standard fear to having an undead only fear.  Further narrowing that could be fixed easily.<P>5. Fix the hammer pet and also replace the last summon hammer in the spell line with a reduced power pet.  Make it a hammer and shield pet that lasts more than one fight (can still limit it some other way) and then tune it more for defense so clerics can us it to solo better at high levels where they need it (druids and shamans are having their grouping abilities increased to solve everyone's problems in getting groups, give clerics better soloability to solve their problem).  Make it non-viable in a group somehow (damage dealt, hit points, and AC are divided by number of group members present perhaps?), and decrease the offensive output if needed overall.  <P>6. Make Cure Blindness actually work  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">...sorry just had to throw that one in there, not a balance issue.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Kalven:  If it's sickening to hear clerics flamed, why isn't it sickening to hear druids constantly flamed.  If you read the boards, there's a three to one ratio of threads antagonistic toward druids as opposed to clerics.  I think you are missing the point.<P>-------<P>Clerical curses sound cool, although due to their superiority in healing, a grouped cleric should always be a healer.  A self mana regen PRAYER also sounds cool.  A self port to one temple also sounds cool, but I don't know if they can code in a new, universal teleport spot in the old zones.<P>Religion based spells also sound cool.  Like heals, clerics should excel with the other priest classes being secondary.  Why shouldn't the large races get the benefits of them just because they don't have clerics.  Is there a race that doesn't have clerics but does have druids?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I feel that clerics need to be the master of healing!  I understand why they added the healing spells to the other two classes.  They wanted to make it so people could go places without a cleric.  Which is fine.  But, in the process of doing this you need to increase the cleric's power in some other way to make them still wanted in groups.<P>Adding a few of these would work.<P>1.  Auto Meditate.  I am not holding my breathe for this one but I thought I would list it.<P>2.  Slow the attack speed of the mob some how.  If you look at class balance when the patch goes live I would much rather have a shaman in my group then a cleric.  The shaman can speed up melee slow down mobs(which equals less healing) and heal almost as good as a cleric.<P>3.  Make cleric yaulp not self only.  Or increase cleric offensive power so the spell would actually be used.<P>4.  Give us a magic debuffer or damage spells that are not just based on MR.  Another option is to make Cleric damage and stun spell less resistible the same way you made wizard nukes.<P>5.  This is the one I would really love to see.  Make Group healing more mana efficient since it is a cleric only type healing spell.  Right now the only time area effect heals are worth casting is if 4 or more people in the group are damaged.  I would suggest making it effective if 2 people are damaged.  Such as word of healing(49) healing 883hp(Superior Healing amount) for 500 mana(double the cost of Superior Healing)  This would not be used a lot because most of the time you are just healing one person.  But it would be nice for multi pulling fights.<P>6.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE fix Celestial Healing.  It will not work on someone who is poisoned, diseased or DOTED.  It makes the spell useless in a lot of areas.<P>7.  Make a group version of Celestial Healing.<P>8.  Fix Mark of Karn(Un-Nerf)<P>9.  Add a mark of Karn type spell at 50 or 51.<P>10.  Make our pet like a Dot mana verses damage wise.<P>11.  Invisibility would be nice but I am not counting on this one.<P>12.  Having Clerics with teleport spells would be nice but it wouldn't make a cleric more group efficent DON'T add them!<P>13.  Make our symbol line of spells cheaper!<P>14.  Make our Buffs Better.<P>One last thing.  Absor Could you please clarify something for me.  About 6 months ago your predecessor(don't remember his name) said that the classes where balanced.  Now you are changing all of that.  Not just a little change but MAJOR changes!  So if the classes are balanced 6 months ago what changed???  The classes sure didn't.  The level of Mobs didn't.  What I am trying to say is I feel for all Cleric's and warriors.  It would be like your boss saying hey your on the same level as your co-worker and then all off a sudden giving your co-worker extra money on his bonus check while still saying your balanced.  It just doesn't work that way.  That's why people of mad.<P>Personally if I had my way if you give something to one class(since they where balanced 6 months ago and nothing has changed) You need to at least make up for it with the other classes.<P>Thanks for taking the time and reading this.<P>Mistie 50th level cleric<BR>Silkie 50th level Wizard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I HATE HAVING "ONE" ROLE IN A GROUP.  we are the better healer but we shouldnt be the only healer.<P>and i am tired of only having good dmg/mana dd vs. undead.  if we are so good at slaying one type of creature, we should be better than a wizard.  i mean undead ice comet at 49.  even when there is undead to fight the cleric is still sitting down and medding.  why? because we suck at melee and nuking (even undead).  the mana is too precious to waste on anything else but healing.<P>all i have heard is clerics begging to have thier healing left to only them.  why? because it is the only thing we can do good.<P>all the cleric need to quit asking for just a little more,  and start asking for alot more.  our class is boring. i remember hitting 35 lvl and finally seeing combat cause i didnt have to stare at my spell book and the little red bars of my group members.  the only time i cast damage and stun is when im bymyself and trying to get away form green creatures  who i had no chance of beating.  normally it goes stun, root run to zone.<P>evolin 51 cleric<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First of all, by all means improve the healing capabilities of other priest classes. I'm a cleric of the 35th circle and being the primary healer, I certainly want my backup healers to be able to heal me effectively. Any improvements to druid or shaman healing only benifits the cleric class, as I see it.<P>The whine about not being able to increase mana regen has some merit -- druids eventually get a skin buff that does it, shamans can cannibalize, clerics = nada.<P>So that made me realize that my suggestion really is a class balance issue. But I'm not advocating that clerics be given mana regen capability! Nothing of the sort. But my suggestion does allow the cleric to regen mana at meditation speed while still healing the party: the ability to bind wounds while sitting down!<P>This would greatly reduce downtime during the game which is something that everyone hates. It adds an extra ability to our class that is right in line with our class' purpose. And because of the restrictions on bind wounds, it in no way overbalances the class. It can only be done after level ~35 because that is when you can just sit down to meditate.<P>To remind people, bind wounds completely freezes the one doing the binding for several seconds during which you can do nothing. If the person you are binding moves, the bind wounds is cancelled, and in fact requires a sit-down/sit-up combination to clear the binding state. Finally, the amount it heals is severely restricted -- only 1/4 your skill is healed in hitpoints. For clerics, the current skill cap is 200, which means a maximum of 50 hps can be healed. Which further means that this will only be used after everyone is severely injured and the priests are out of mana.<P>There has been talk of raising the maximum percentage of hit points healed with bind wounds depending on class. I would add the following to that discussion:<P>Bind up to 50% -- All classes, bandages only.<BR>Bind up to 70% -- Melee and priest classes, 2x bandages plus ointment of some kind.<BR>Bind up to 90% -- Cleric class only, 3x bandages plus 2x ointment plus balm.<P>The ointment and balm requirements puts a price/carrying-capacity limitation on the ability. The ointment should be purchased in melee and priest guild halls. The balm should be purchasable only in cleric halls.<P>Shamans should be able to make the ointments and balms as a part of the alchemy skill.<P>Thanks again for your attention to these matters, Alan!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Another suggestion is to fix or change the Death Pact series of spells.  This is a great idea, but sounds like it is just so unpredictable as to be not worth the effort.  Basically, from what I have gathered, it just doesn't proc often enough, and even when it does, the amount healed is so small that it prolongs life for just one more round or so.<P>My suggestion is to make it a spell that is used IN COMBAT for when the crap hits the fan, rather than as a normal buff used pre-encounter.<P>Give the spell a VERY fast cast time, say 1 second.  Make the recast delay long if you'd like. The spell can still have a reagent, but keep the mana cost reasonable, it can't be too expensive to be prohibitive.  The spell would be very short duration, say somewhere between 30 seconds and one minute, but it would proc successfully 99% of the time.<P>What would be the value of this spell?  It would be used for when things get hairy in a group and the Cleric has to make a split decision on who to save...  If two party members are getting beat on and there might not be time to get off 2 heals, or if you aren't sure your Enchanter will live for the 10 seconds you are Complete Healing the tank...<P>Basically, whenever you have two heal 2 or more people at the same time, and you fear one will die, you cast the fast (1 sec) Death Pact on one character, then start your regular heal on the second.  If you guessed wrong, and the one you chose not to heal (but DPed) winds up dying, that Death Pact instant heal would hopefully be enough to keep them alive long enough to get off the second heal that wil save them.<P>Now THAT would be an AWESOME spell that would be worth even an expensive component (like a Pearl or even Peridot IF it worked well enough to justify) AND would solidify the Cleric as the true Lord of Healing, no matter how much you beefed up the backup healers.<P>Euboa.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

If you want to fix it, don't just give our healing away, use a combination of giving some pof our healing away, but also make the cleric class more fun to increse the cleric population.  The best way I can think of to do this:<P>Standing medetation at level 50(something I think should be given to Wiz's as well).  Let us med while in combat, but not while traveling.  It will alow us to add more to combat while we have druids and shamen to help heal, and were not going to be doing enough damage for it to be unbalancing.  Add the fact that were going to have to be careful not to be agro'd and not be able to heal, it will at much more excitement to the cleric class..while not really giving us that much more power</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well I have been really thinking on this since I posted in an early part of the thread.  My conclusions:<P>Don't waste my time with improved melee, improved defense, standing med, auto-med, DOTs, improved DD, or improved Bind Wound (who in the world is wasting time binding wounds). All that stuff is practically irrelevant to post 50 life - actually before. <P>Number one on my wishlist is: Invisibility - I don't care (or even understand) why some say this is innapropriate for clerics.  We can bring people back from the dead, but we can't get past pathetic green mobs?  Invis would *really* help.  How many times do you have to get somewhere for a res or just to hook up with your group and you have to drag invis potions (like there isn't enough to drag around already, e.g., the spiraling number of keys) or wait for someone to invis you.  Almost everyone has it already.

</FONT><HR>I play a cleric and I like the class.  As far as *BALANCING* I don't think we really need that much.  Most suggestions involve cross-class abilities or making the cleric actually more self-sufficient = solo, which would require changing several additional things.  <P>One item of note: Regeneration.<P>The most mana-efficient has been (traditionally) the Regeneration line.  True the spell takes longer for full effect, but if there isn't any mana-enhancing abilities present in the group, the party has to wait while the casters med anyway.  <P>As written the first regeneration spell that shamans get at level 24 is 100 mana for 500 points of healing.  <P>By comparison the Greater Healing spell is 150 mana for 300 healing.  Granted, it is instant, but if used during downtime is not nearly as efficient as Regeneration.  <P>Would it be possible to add the Regeneration series to clerics?  <P>On the not so necessary for balance but would be nice category: <P>Bind Wound skill.  I would like a cleric-only version that allows this to be done while medding.  Right now it is *NOT* efficient because of the penalty in meditation time.  <P>I suppose being able to med while bandaging would be nice, but then it *would* be a manaless heal and might actually be imbalancing.  <P>I don't see the need to raise the bandaging cap until this is addressed because if you could say bandage everyone else up to 80% or 90% health, your tanks will be ready but then you will be way behind in medding time.  <P>Cheers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I see a LOT of wonderful ideas in here. I have a level 53 cleric that I play and would love to see some of these things put into our field. One thing that has ALWAYS bothered me though, is Divine Aura. Basically, your GOD is PERSONALLY protecting you for 15 seconds. Why, why, WHY is a GOD unable to protect me from being stunned? Also, if you cast Divine Aura while being attacked, the monster immediatly stops attacking you and goes attack someone else. This makes sense to me, "Hmm... this person isn't being hurt by me, I should attack someone else." What DOESN'T make sense is, when that fifteen seconds is up, that monster somehow IMMEDIATELY knows that you are vulnerable again. So, in that situation, DA basically comes down to "Hope the monster is killed in that 15 seconds, or run away and abandon your party". <P>What I would like to see for the DA type spells is:<P>1. Make us protected from Stuns,<BR>2. Allow us to be healed while protected.<BR>   (I'm not asking to be able to attack or cast    just let someone else be able to save my life!)<BR>3. If a monster STOPS attacking us because we just    used DA, then we should be moved down the aggro    list to signify that it takes a little while to    figure out that I'm NOT invulnerable anymore.    This shouldn't be something that monsters just    Intuit.<P>Those are my thoughts.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>Avail Almighty (Cleric of Tunare)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My experience as a cleric leads me to say this:<P>1. Clerics can't solo effectively after level 20.  Therefore, being able to get into a group is of supreme importance.  It is important not to jeopardize their importance in a level 50+ group.<P>2. Clerics heal.  If they try to do anything other than that with their mana they are criticized by the group members.  Therefore, it is important to make this be their one talent that is not compromised by other classes.<P>If druids and shaman need improvements to make them accepted at high levels, then please do so by improving their particular class talents and not by giving them an enhanced talent that is the core of another class.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>NetProphet:  The new heals for shaman and druids are less about improving those classes, than assisting the other 11.  There is a healing gap post-50.  You guys can't fill it, for there are more groups than clerics.  It shouldn't be necessary for every group to have one particular class.  Presently, that's how it is.<P>Groups want to play, but can't without a cleric.  Is that fair to them?  As your heals will still kick my druidic butt, as soon as one of you wants to join (and there's a spot), you'll get in.  What's the problem?

</FONT><HR>I play a level 56 cleric and I have to agree, the post 50 game is so boring that I'm considering shelving him.<P>If the following issues were solved or granted I think it would greatly improve the fun factor and the viability factor in one shot.<P>Celestial Healing has become a permanant part of my spell gems. Only one HUGE problem, if someone is dotted in any way the spell simply don't stick. So now I've wasted the mana and the time, both of which are precious during battle. To further problems if the dot (which you have to guess unless you take the time to ask) is disease based it takes 3 casts to remove it. Why in the name of Brell can I not cast a disease removal spell ONCE to remove it?  It basically renders the spell useless. Make it stack with any dot good or bad and fix or add a Disease cure that works with one cast.<P>Unswerving hammer of uselessness. I'm sorry I even have it memmed. Either make it worth using or replace it with something we can actually use. I mean 600 mana for what 100 damage? Good idea, bad implementation. <P>Invisibility, either make the potions stack or give me a self only invis. I'd prefer the self only invis but i always have to buy 5 potions at least. I think we spend enough for peridots already. If I need to run 5 zones away to do a res which happens more often than I care to think then I must have invis. Like Air Conditioning in Florida its simply not an option.<P>Defensive skills, I think we're ok there. I am a group cleric by nature so solo doesn't interest me and I rarely draw aggro.<P>Level 50+ pet, heh it'd be nice to give us some new toy. I liked the idea of a pet that can cast heal. /pet heal &lt;tank name here&gt; Sounds fun.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Regen spell, um YES. A small regen, ANY regen would be a huge help.<P>Group AC buff, um why have we not already had this?<P>Gate or port to temple could be problematic with the PoG faction hits. Imagine popping up at the cleric guild in Felwithe being KoS. ewwww<P>Self only travel spell like Selo's, speed buff, levitate and invis all in one would HUGELY assist me in going to do resses and I'd actually look forward to the trip rather than dreading that long trek that may get me ganked at any point along the way. Give it a chance of dropping same as invis.<P>Reduce fizzles on our healing spells. I'm so disgusted with being a healer for 56 levels and fizzling one out of 5 attempts at my chosen professional spell line. It has to be the single most aggravating facet of my class.<P>Casting times, if you give the druids and shamans our heals then reduce our cast times and mana costs to make us BETTER at healing.<P>I also like the idea of changing Death Pact to a 1 second cast and grant maybe 800hp with an 80 or 90% chance of success. Mana cost should be around 500. Obviously far more useful than Unswerving Hammer of Nothingness. Make the upgrade do 1200hp for 400mana with a slightly improved success rate. Also make it cost a regent, say a pearl or the same cost. I'd carry 40 pearls for a spell this fun.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Why should I be, why should any of us be really. They'll never be able to take the place of a single cleric 10 lvls lower than them. It would take 3 of them to take the place of 1 cleric of an equal lvl, and you still don't really get the effectiveness of a clerics heals. So, more power to you guys. <P>What am I torqued about? Ahh.. well.. here we go.<P>Clerics suck and you guys keep turning a blind eye to it. Well, we don't suck, but we sure are so far beyond dull to play that I would honestly tell everyone who wants to play one to reconsider. It is HARD to be a cleric, heck, toss hard out the window. You have to be nutz to play one, yes I am nutz, and certafiable to play one to post 50. I'm workin' on it guys, I'm workin' on it.<P>I don't give two chits about you giving other classes all these wonderfull abilities, heck I group with these people, the better they are, the easier time I have of it. But stop ignoring clerics.<P>I am so sick of going through 2 hour downloads for updates only to read the update.txt file at the end and see that I just went through that so a Druid could get my heal spells, or so an Enchanter got some better blasts, or so I could see that Warriors get invis.<P>I have routinely see you address every single complaint the other classes have while blithely ignoring the clerics. Heck, you even answer the issues the other classes have about the equipment the clerics get that make our lives just a bit easier or more entertaining. <P>The attitude of the post that opens these discusions is so totally uncaring it's scary. But it's the general attitude towards clerics I've experienced since starting one. Oh.. just another place for clerics to whine. Bah, whine? Please read the posts, they're some of the more intelligent posts you'll see around. But we whine. <P>But I digress, wouldn't want people to think I'm whining, would I?<P>I've went and looked at the other posts, seen how they start. With a list of changes, things that are being done to make classes better. Yet here it's.. <P>I'm doing this because I've already done the other two healer classes.<P>Does this sound like. I'm putting this up here so you guys can whine here and not on the other discussion topics where we actually give a rats butt about what's being said. These super longs posts get anoying to scroll past after a while to anyone else out there? <P>Clerics are already a well balanced class and don't need any real changes.<P>Well balanced? At lvl 1 maybe.<P>5000 minutes.. that's how long it would take me to solo my way through lvl 30. Watched a Wizard do it in 4 hours, SOLO. And they've got more gripes than a cleric could ever have. Yah, I play one of those too. Glutton for punishment.<P>For those of you who's math skills aren't very good, 5000 minutes equals out to more than 3 days of actual play time. You know how long it takes to actually log 3 days of play time? I've been playing my cleric for 5 months and have only logged 15 days so far. And that is an honest to god number, believe me, when you med as much as a cleric does, you have PLENTY of time to figure out stupid little facts like that. <P>I enjoy my cleric, for some sick and twisted reason, I like helping people, being the guy who martyrs himself to save the party. I'm wierd. But jesus, the people I used to group with at lvl 10 are now lvl 50! 20 lvls above me. Why? Because instead of sitting there hoping a group wouldn't mind splitting the xp with a cleric in return for less down time, they are out killing stuff. Sure, they're little mobs, don't give a ton of xp, but at least they can do something. Heck, it's not even always little mobs. US clerics, if we're not in a group, we can solo greens for no xp to kill time. <P>But what about undead.. <P>What about them, at lvl 30 I can't find an undead that gives xp that I can solo without endangering an entire zone. Believe me, 10 trains into Unrest and your getting some REALLY nasty tells. It's not to be said that without some planning, and some immense patience, and luck, that we can't solo, we can. It's just so slow and dangerous that you rarely find someone with the patience and guts to do it, and you can ignore only so many, Listen you moron, tells before you finally just mumble screw it and head to a different zone in the hopes that someone will want ya in a group.<P>But wait you say, Your a cleric, you should be able to get a group no problem. Wrong and Wrong. AT my lvl Shamans and DRuids are MUCH more saught after. Add to this the fact that everyone would prefer, if not a druid/sham then a cleric who is lvl 34, or higher. Better heals of course, which is the only reason we get a group in the first place. Who do I group with? If I'm lucky I can get a guild party going of people's alts, yah, used to be able to hunt with they're primaries but they've out lvl'd me so far I'm no longer able to group and get xp. If I'm really lucky I can get into a group, but it's not that often, right now. I do realize of course that this problem will go away at the higher lvls, but for right now, I will loose a group spot to a sham/druid/34 cleric every time. So I'm left sitting there killing one mob every 10 minutes that moves that little xp bar, even the blue one, so small an amount that I often wonder why I even bother.<P>A balanced class you say, yet if you take 15 minutes to read even 1/100th of the posts on this board, even the shortest, you will find that there are issues that need resolution. <P>What absolutely boggles my mind is that these aren't massive issues. They are playability issues, things that SHOULD be resolved. <P>There is a REASON there is 1 cleric for every 20 of any other class. The way things are now you have to be a lunatic to play one. I remember when I started mine, never got so many odd looks in my life. Yer playing a cleric?!?! And I went 2 steps further, I play an Erud Cleric, and not only an ERud, an EVIL Erud Cleric, nothing like being kos in every city that sells yer spell regiments. But what about Paineel you say.. I'd like to personally brain the guy that designed the place. Forget something did we, a Jewler who sells more than 4 types of jewels? Ahh.. and that's not even the kicker.. the jewler doesn't sell ANY of the jewels for our spells, who's brilliant idea was that? <P>So now you see, we're not a balanced class, we are a healing punchin' bag. <P>Everyone is going to look at this and think I'm nuts, I am too, and happily. Sanity is so over rated.<P>I don't hold anything against anyone, I just want you people to open your eyes and take a look at what's being said here. It's VALID. <P>Someone said earlier on that Clerics are a dieing breed, we are. How do you fix it, the dumbest way possible. Instead of making clerics better you ignore them and increase the abilities of 2 of the most played classes in the game. Sure, it fixes the problem, but following age old form, you take something away from being a cleric. Back when our buffs were the bomb, and no one could out heal a lvl 39 cleric we had people who would play the dullest class in the game just for the pleasure of being the buffer and healer. When I first started this game I played a Rogue, do you know what I would have done for Cleric buffs for that rogue? ::drools:: Now anyone with two wits of sence will go after druid/sham buffs for 2 reasons. They are nearly as effective, and last an apeload longer. Heck in a group even I AS a cleric will ask for the longer lasting buffs. I'm nutz, not stupid.<P>My point?<P>Don't ignore the reality. Clerics need help. And for gods sake, if your going to do it, at least LOOK like you marginally care what we have to say. I get terribly insulted when valid issues are being ignored in every concievable way possible.<P>Take the time to read these posts, look at what people are saying and at least pretend to take them into consideration.<P>Oh.. and to that statement of<P>I talked to a few clerics at the Fan Fair and while having reservations none of them.. yadayada yada.<P>Consider for 2 seconds the mental impact of a face to face meeting. People will agree when facing a person to something they normally wouldn't just to avoid confrentation, that and these posts don't get whipped up out of thin air, few people could think up their posts in less than an hour, and while it would take only moments to SAY these things, it is in truth something that takes time to think about and consider.. one must wonder. How long did that conversation last?<P><BR>Evandan FearForged<BR>30th lvl Cleric<BR>Povar<P>There is a fine line between Genius and Insanity.
