&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>The argument rages: Make shamans and druids better healers. Shamans and druids demand it. Clerics reject it.<P>It's been said before, but I'll try again:<P>Clerics are one-dimensional. They give hp. They do this 3 ways, through healing, through buffing, and through rezzing.<P>No matter how you look at it, the three main things clerics do is giving hp to people who are hurt, are about to be hurt, or who are dead.<P>This is very useful, but is fairly one-dimensional.<P>The two other healing classes can do other things quite well. They also give HP, but they can give speed, cause damage, give invisibility, do damge over time, reduce mobs' speed, reduce mobs' damage, etc.<P>Clerics do none of those things.<P>People like druids and shamans. People invite them into groups. Primarily due to their versatility.<P>People also like clerics. People invite them into groups, too. Primarily because they give HP.<P>If druids and shamans are significantly enhanced to give HP better, then this will tip some scales. <P>Shamans and druids will become even more versatile and even more desirable in groups. Great. Good for them. They certainly deserve it.<P>Clerics won't become less versatile as they are already fairly one-dimensional. However, there will be fewer groups looking for clerics because many of them will be making due with shamans and druids acting as primary healers.<P>Now, when those versatile shamans and druids have trouble finding groups, their versatility enables them to solo. Thus they can still play the game, still progress by gaining exp and loot by soloing.<P>When one-dimensional clerics can't find a group, they lack the versatility to solo and thus must sit around, waiting for a group to need them. They cannot still play the game, still progress by gaining exp and loot by soloing.<P>What happens if druids and shamans are given the ablity to heal as well, or nearly as well, as a cleric?<P>The number of groups playing won't increase. The number of primary group healer positions won't increase. The number of characters capable of fulfilling that role of primary group healer will triple. This means that there is only 1/3 the number of primary healer positions for clerics to fulfil.<P>Increase the viability of shamans and druids to join groups, thus taking a spot that a cleric could have filled, and that means that the next cleric in that zone to want a group won't find a spot; won't be able to play. Won't be able to travel as quickly or as safely to another zone to look for a group as a shaman or druid, either.<P>Do shamans and druids need high-level upgrades to healing to be playable in post-50 groups. Yes.<P>But never at the risk of overtaking those coveted group healing spots from clerics. Clerics cannot play this game without groups. Cannot even play this game at all without groups.<P>Do clerics need dots and sow and snare and all that other stuff. No. Shame on those clerics who are asking for it. That is not the answer. That is simply trolling and provoking hostility.<P>Clerics could stand a slight improvement on some of our weaker healing spells. They should see some improvement in their soloing skills, to make them viable to play without a group.<P>And shamans and druids should see some improvement to their healing ability, so long as it reamains, at all levels, weaker than the healing ability of a cleric of the same level, or even of a cleric a few (few, not a lot) levels lower than the druid/shaman.<P>No, most clerics are not paranoid. But that point above about having only 1/3 the healer positions open is a valid one.<P>Sure, you may say that if there is a cleric and a druid at the zone, and you need a primary healer, you would pick the cleric. <P>But how often does this happen? <P>Most often, when a healer leaves a group, that group takes the nearest healer available. Quite often none are available. Sometimes only one is available. <P>If no cleric is sitting at the zoneline, a druid or shaman will get the job. Once that druid or shaman is in the group, the cleric that zones in or logs in a couple minutes later is out of a job. Unable to play at all. Possibly for a long time before another group has a healer opening.<P>You say that is happening to shamans and druids now.<P>Point taken. But only at the upper levels. And I have already conceded that shamans and druids need healing upgrades at the upper levels.<P>I hope this sheds some light on the issue. I hope this puts those whining clerics in their place when they claim clerics need all that versatility the other two priest classes enjoy. Clerics do not need this. They do need their function, their only function, that of giving HP, protected so that their utility in a group is not overshadowed by instantly tripling the number of characters able to provide this function.<P>Morodullin<BR>HP Giving Priest o Brell<P>(repost)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wow. That is the single most lucid post I have seen on this topic. Kudos. <P>Personally, I play both a cleric and a druid(among others) though not high enough level to truly understand the whole issue of grouping at 50+. <P>I have noticed that with my cleric I can get almost constant tells with offers to join parties, even at level 9, yet my druid, at level 19, has never received an offer without asking.<P>By the same token, I started my druid specifically to have a character that I could play and just pair up with my wife, so I didn't really want to do much 'normal' grouping. We just go have fun. <P>It's not really a class that can compete on healing with a cleric, and it shouldn't be. <P>If I have a yearning to group, I log in my cleric or my warrior. If I want to solo or pair, I log in my druid. <P>I think this whole thing has been blown way out of proportion - it is a game. It's just not that important. I guess if I was considerably younger, I might think having something about one of my characters changed was the worst thing to happen to EQ. <P>As it is, I think these message boards are among the worst things to happen to EQ. Basically, Verant listens to those that whine loudest, not necessarily those that have the 'best' input. <P>That's my 2cp.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Orodruin, well done. Very VERY well done. Thank you...<P>I agree with every single one of your points and wish that you had spoken up earlier...<P>I (another cleric) also agree with you that the post 50 druids and shamen need something better n the way of healing spells. <P>Here's a suggestion to increase "clerical versatility" (and I would appreciate your opinion on this thought please)...<P>I have a close friend who plays a wizard. As a class, wizards are primarily self-only buffers with the exception of levitate and gate type spells. They do have something that I covet though - and that is their damage shields.<P>When a wizard has a damage shield up, they can still cast spells, attack, etc.<P>When a cleric has their Divine Aura or Barrier up, they can do NOTHING except run. No casting of spells, no attacking, nothing.<P>I most DEFINITELY agree with your post that as a class, we clerics are "hooped" unless we group up with other players. Heck - I can rarely cross a zone of my level and LIVE if I am solo - and I am ALWAYS shocked when I do make it. (I don't know,- maybe it's just my general gnomey cuteness that causes the critters to love my company so much.)<P>Anyway - the suggestion is what do you think of a new line of self-only damage shields being made available to the cleric class? They would be around the same as that received by wizards, but at a higher level (after all clerics are NOT the masters of magic) and would use gems as their component the same way the wizard buffs damage shields do now.<P>Regards,<P>Tynkah Toyz<BR>The Rathe<BR>"Cutest Lil Cleric in Norrath!"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>PUH-LEASE.<P>1. Most druids/shaman that I have talked to don't want to be much better healer. Heck, most would be pleased to just have the fizzle rate of Superior Heal reduced or have the spell moved to 49 which would likely accomplish that anyway.<P>2. Please do not generalize.  Druids and some shaman can solo. Big deal!  Soloing is darn boring!  I have grouped from levels 1-53. I LIKE to group.  I want to group.  <P>3.  As things now stand, you need a cleric in your group to do almost anything to get experience post 52.  There are NOT enough clerics to go around.  So, we want to be able to do some things anyway.  Perhaps, not as effectively, but BE ABLE to do it.  <BR>Sebilis, Howling Stones, Chardok, much of SoV requires clerics at the moment.  Is it the rezzing? NO.  It's the FACT that druids and shaman cannot team up to heal effectively.  Why should 5 people sit around until they can find a cleric? Everyone would prefer a cleric for healing, but they are not always available.  Everquest should not revolve around any one class just because you are now post 50. That is NOT balanced and it's just plain wrong.<P>So, you are saying that improving shaman/druid heals will mean cleric's are out of a group?  Get real.  Verant will NEVER give incredible healing power to a shaman or a druid.  They can and may improve what shaman and druids can do in the healing department.  Think about it.  What may happen is that the druid or shaman in the cleric's group can actually do an effective job as a back up healer. Maybe then the CLERIC can actually do something OTHER than med/heal/buff. Ever think of that?  Geez.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree on some points and disagree on others. I don't want to go on and argue the details, but there is a point I want to make.<P>You cannot take away a lot of grouping value to a class simply on the basis of soloing power in a game fundamentally designed around grouping. You could make a very very strong argument that clerics have to be marginal soloers by design because being able to solo very well and ressurect yourself is too strong of a combination, and thus it is because of ressurection that clerics aren't the very best soloers instead of some hypothetical trade - but I digress.<P>By putting too many limits on the true grouping value of a class with the justification that they have a soloing advantage, you force soloing upon them. It is no longer an advantage or even really an option, but a necessity dictacted by game design - not good for a teamwork game.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

However, there will be fewer groups looking for clerics because many of them will be making due with shamans and druids acting as primary healers.&gt;<P>This is already the case.  There simply are never enough Clerics around, so most of the time, groups have Shamen, Druids or even Pallys or Rangers filling the roll of primary healer.  They just cannot adequately do the job at the present time and that limits what goups can do.  As far as I'm concerned, there are 2 options here:<P>1.) Enhancing the healing abilities of other classes.<P>or...<P>2.) Giving Clerics more reason to play, as there are simply not enough out there currently.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Tynkah_Toyz,<P>No, for me, a damage shield won't do it. <P>In groups, the last thing I want is to be taking a pounding. A DS would only increase my aggro and make it harder for the tanks to pull the mob off me.<P>Soloing, as a dwarf cleric, I am probably the best tanking race of clerics. And I can't tank to save my life.  My STR is 130, My HP about 1500 buffed, my AC is nearly 900, yet I get my hat handed to me by a simple spectre, blue for a number of levels now. A DS won't help me melee any exp-giving mob. I can solo spectres, when I find an available camp, by rooting them, and slapping three banish undead spells on em. DS won't help there.<P>Thanks for the suggestion though. Keep em coming.<P><BR>Fyreheart,<P>Apology accepted.<P>In response, my generalization that druids and shaman can solo and that clerics can't (except against single undead mobs that are so rare that more than 3 clerics 45+ soloing the entire continent of Antonica will use up all the available spawns), I didn't mean to imply that these classes should solo or that they like to solo. I know. I've gone LFG in Lower Guk for a half hour or so until I got bored and went to Feerott to solo spectres. Almost always camped, but I found it empty a couple times. Soloing those specs is good exp but boring as all get out. All the other times it has been camped I simply logged and played an alt.<P>And I agree, 5 people should not sit around because they can't find a primary healer. That is my point in supporting high level healing increases for shamans and druids. You want the healing ability of a 49 cleric? Then a 54 shaman should suffice. That sort of thing. But never a 49 shaman, or clerics will be competing for those solo spectres even more, and logging to their alts even more.<P>A_yew_tree00,<P>Excellent point. I agree, and admit I hadn't seen it that way.<P>I hope I had not implied that soloing ability should be balanced against grouping ability; that was not my intent.<P>My intent is to suggest, and support, that shamans and druids need better healing ability at higher levels. My intent is to demonstrate that this might and probably will meet greater competition for clerics to find primary healer spots in groups. It is expected that a cleric will likely win the competition against a druid or shaman when all are asking to join a group at the same time. However, many groups will form with a druid or shaman primary healer because no clerics are available at that time, only to have a cleric enter zone and now be unable to join those fully formed groups.<P>And when this happens to shamans and druids, they have the alternate play mode available. They can go solo. Not just the occasional, rare undead camp, but anything in their level range. 4 at a time, sometimes. When this happens to clerics, they have no alternative. They just don't play Everquest until they can find a group.<P>Soloability is not related to groupability, and balancing issues should not be made, or at least should give only light consideration, on the basis of this. However, talks about balancing any class relative to any other class must always consider the consequences of the balance. <P>Balancing the healing of shamans and druids will result in those classes getting invited to more groups. That is the whole reason, after all, for these classes requesting the upgrade. At least, I haven't yet heard a druid saying he wants better healing so after he's done quad-kiting, he can more efficiently heal himself and conserve mana for the next quad-kiting assault.<P>Naturally, since the number of groups won't increase, and therefore the number of primary group healer positions won't increase, but healing-enhanced druids and shamans are getting invited into these groups, some clerics are going to be excluded from them. And the natural question at this point is, "What can they do if they can't find a group?"<P>We already ask that about druids and shamans not finding a group. The answer is, "They can solo. They may not like it. It may be boring. But they can do it, and can get exp/plat/loot while continuing to seek a group."<P>Enhance the healing of druids and shamans too much and when we ask that question of clerics, the answer will be, "Not much. They will have to sit around, looking for groups, doing nothing. They won't get exp/plat/loot while continuing to seek a group. They can't play the game while they wait."<P>So while soloing and grouping are apples and oranges, they are still both in the same fruit basket, and one cannot be considered without weighing its impact on the other.<P>Morodullin<BR>Debating Priest o Brell<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The problem for clerics is not so much that they don't have other abilities.  They do.  They are just *so* dominant at healing that it's usually a waste of mana for them to do anything but heal in a combat situation.<P>Reasonable shamans and druids are not asking for anything approaching the healing ability of clerics, but still the whole point IS to make clerics less needed in groups.  I'm not going to sugarcoat that.  ANY increase in healing abilities for shamans and druids, even reducing the fizzle rate of SH, will have some impact on the need for clerics.  You have to realize though, that no other single class in the high level game is so needed right now as the cleric.  If there are scales to be tipped, they are being tipped in the right direction.

</FONT><HR>From what I have seen its pretty much accepted that the game should not revolve around 1 class.  Two backup healers should be able to heal a group just as effectively as 1 Cleric.<P>Fix the backup healers without pushing the Cleric class in to oblivion (I think Absors ideas were perfect).<P>Make the Cleric job more interesting.  Perhaps balancing healing will have Clerics grabbing their nearest backup healer once again so they have their hands free to have some fun.

</FONT><HR>"Soloability is not related to groupability, and balancing issues should not be made, or at least should give only light consideration, on the basis of this. However, talks about balancing any class relative to any other class must always consider the consequences of the balance."<P>Point taken. The consequences must be looked at a larger scale too, in part, how it affects the desirability of each class, and also how it affects the gameplay experience for everyone else - which certainly cannot be seperated with the great deal of interdependence built into the game.<P>"Naturally, since the number of groups won't increase, and therefore the number of primary group healer positions won't increase, but healing-enhanced druids and shamans are getting invited into these groups, some clerics are going to be excluded from them. And the natural question at this point is, "What can they do if they can't find a group?""<P>I must disagree with the premise of your point. Before 50th level, a druid or shaman could simply grab a few people so long as there was some semblance of balance and start a group. I myself used to start groups all the time in the old days as a druid, just grabbing whoever was available and we'd make things work. That was lots of fun. We didn't disallow clerics to join us. In fact they almost always had their own groups. Thus the fact that I could act as the only group healer did indeed increase the number of active groups and really had very little impact on clerics at all.<P>Now granted, these days with experience loss being so bad I wouldn't do something like that again lightly. A druid acting as group healer takes terrible risks with the lack of clerical buffs, the divine series, and paper-class armor. Personally I wouldn't want to go into any of the higher level dungeons without a cleric to ressurect me even if they had no healing power whatsoever (not that I'm advocating that!)<P>However, on the other hand, one thing that happens very often is my guild will field a typical group in a dungeon complete with cleric. Given enough healing power to keep a group alive, I could coordinate with the cleric in the first group, gather any of our people looking for a group and start a "sister" group nearby. Once again we've increased the number of groups, made druids and shamans more group friendly, and opened more groups so classes that aren't typical first-tier choices will not "go hungry".<P>With pickup groups after 50th level. I can't imagine clericless groups being an overly common practice. Deaths without experience rezzes are unthinkable, corpse summoning is a gigantic hassle, dragging corpses manually to a cleric using invis, ivu, or even a rogue is almost impossible, so I know personally in a straight out pickup group I would never want to go anywhere without a cleric unless I was camping right at the zone line, or I was camping right next to a group with a cleric willing to uproot the group to come rez us.<P>So while groups could exist without clerics, I think the risks and special conditions it would take to mitigate those risks, combined with the simple fact that it would indeed create more groups,  and thus have a very small impact on the number of groups available for clerics.<P>Regarding your question, "What can they do if they can't find a group?" This is a valid issue. I submit however, and I'm sure you'd agree, that there are more than a few classes who are even more group-dependent than clerics and are in the same boat. <P>My answer is this - in the big picture, class balance needs to be looked at in such a way to make it easier to make good groups that are reasonably safe and moderately efficient with whatever classes you have at hand as long as those classes cover the basic needs. The bonus for having specialists is that they should make a group more efficient, however not to the point where Verant feels they must adjust the encounters with specialists in mind to prevent trivializing any encounters. At that point the specialist goes from being the advantage - the cutting edge - to being the bare necessity and then we start this class balance nightmare all over again.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is my main beef with my druid: how was I suppose to know that I was spending many hours into a character that would later become ineffiencient in groups?? Some people researched many hours in to the game PRIOR to playing...some did not (like I). I do not believe in spoiler sites...I believe in learning what's in the game--in-game. I created a druid after reading the manual and thought, "Cool, this class might be for me." I created this druid and have played it ever since. I did not know that I was going to have problems later down the road--how was I suppose to know? <P>I think it is a little unfair to say that druids asked for this because of their solo ability...I did not create a druid for that (hell, I didn't know what soloing was for a bit!). In addition, I think the post 50 worthiness of classes should not be limited to only druids and shamans. EVERY class should deserve a chance in raids (yes, neromancers also). <P>Why should the game design limit groups consisting of only a monk, warrior, cleric, rogue, and enchanter? There are obvious balance flaws here.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Clerics will always be wanted, no matter how well a druid heals.<P>Or perhaps you were thinking that next time we all go to hate, we'll just bring a bunch of druids/shammies and leave the clerics at home?<P>We want sup heal to stop fizzling so we can be of use again as a SECONDARY healer.

</FONT><HR>Orodruin, this is very well stated and quite calmly reasoned, which I appreciate. But I think you missed two points.<P>One, you state that "these classes" (meaning druids and shamans) are asking for the healing upgrades. From what I have seen outside this board, the majority of classes wishing for such an upgrade are the REST of the classes in EQ, because they want more options than sitting at the zone line waiting for a cleric to do a dungeon crawl. I as a shaman would certainly like to be slightly more effective as a healer to benefit my groups when they're dying around me, but as it is I'm happiest in a group with a cleric because then I get to do the stuff I am really good at. After all, if I had wanted to play primary healer all the time I would have made a cleric. But back to my point, most players calling for a change are the warriors, SKs, wizards, etc. With, of course, the exception of the usual lunatic fringe lurking on this board.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Second point is that yes, if the group is full with two shamans, or two druids, or what have you, there might not be room for a cleric coming into the zone. But you'd better believe as soon as someone leaves that cleric will get a space, in fact the druid or shaman will be the one saying "GET THE CLERIC" a lot of the time. And honestly, how different is this from the warrior having to sit and wait for a group, or the rogue, or the paly? Many classes are group-dependent, in fact most of them are at high levels. They've had to put up with this for a long time, without the high level of desireability a cleric enjoys. And yet if they complain about it, people simply say "Then go start a necro." <P>All in all, I applaud you for not taking the kneejerk threat-response approach in looking at this problem, as too many clerics tend to do on this board. We shamans and druids aren't out to replace you, in fact we will always far prefer having you around. We don't want to be your equals in healing, far from it. Though I know a few warriors who wouldn't mind, so don't blame it on us.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Aradune said, "NO one item should be necessary to be victorious in an expansion, or even significant parts of an expansion..."<BR> <BR>Ok, now replace "ITEM" with "SPELL" and I think we've got something.<BR> <BR>("ITEM" could also be replaced with "CLASS".)<BR> <BR>VI has now admitted that possibly "many" mobs are undefeatable without the assistance of the Donal's BP. ...and more specifically, Complete Healing.<BR> <BR>Clerics are gods right now, having almost complete control of what really matters in the end game... Healing and Experience.<BR> <BR>Get ready to be balanced.  If you quit playing your cleric because you are no longer a god then you will be replaced by those who actually enjoy playing the cleric class.<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>"No matter how you look at it, the three main things clerics do is giving hp to people who are hurt, are about to be hurt, or who are dead."<BR>- Yet another "My class is boring, make me a god" post.  This is a very common response from any cleric and a very weak argument.  Using this logic a wizard should be able to kill any mob in the game in a single casting.  If you think playing a cleric is boring you should go play something else.  The fact is that clerics CAN do much more than the three things you listed but CHOOSE not to.  Clerics can Root/Park mobs, stun to interrupt casting or prevent damage, are wizards in platemail vs. undead., and this is besides ALSO being the best buffers in the game.  If the game is boring to you find another game or another class and stop using it as an excuse to push imbalance in a game others would like to enjoy.<BR> <BR>"Now, when those versatile shamans and druids have trouble finding groups, their versatility enables them to solo. Thus they can still play the game, still progress by gaining exp and loot by soloing."<BR>- EverQuest is not a solo'ing game and it's becoming less and less of one every patch.  Give up on this "I can't solo, make me REQUIRED for every high level group" stance.  It's a weak argument and completely goes against what Aradune has posted.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
