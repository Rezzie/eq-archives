</FONT><HR>Ok, as requested, here is the original post:<P>-Colla-Rodcet-<BR>Station Member   posted 02-18-2001 12:10 AM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>I was trading with a guy named Jumlace about a week ago on the Rodcet Nife server. I gave him a Wurmslayer for 5300 platinum and told him to have at least one inventory slot free. We traded and, apparently ignoring me, he dropped it at the bank in Firiona Vie in the middle of a group of players. I saw it so I picked it up because it was the only thing i had that was worth anything anyway and me and a friend got ported to WC.<BR>I traveled to EC and sat down in the tunnel for a while because I wanted to watch a movie so I just let the game run. About a 1/2 hour or so later, GM Zrinic summons me to a small room with no entrances in Qeynos Catacombs and me and Jumlace meet up. I was told to give him his money back or the Wurmslayer or be suspended. So having no choice I gave him the money back and that was that. Afterward I talked to the GM a bit and told him I didn't think what he was doing was right. He took this as "threatening a GM", said i would be suspended for 7-10 days, and expelled me from the game immediately. <P>I tried getting back in but at the login screen was confronted with a message saying "You have been suspended temporarily....". So I wrote a e-mail to the supervisor and went about my merry way.<P>Today I get a response from the supervisor Henderson that said what I did was fraud under the EQ policy and she BANNED ME! That EQ policy she is referring to is the Play Nice policy, which shouldn't exist in the first place. There is no way I can or should be banned after playing the game for 20+ months over something as redundant as a Wurmslayer. What happened to warnings? What happened to nice GMs that you could almost hang out with? GONE.<P>I am awaiting a second response on this matter before I take some form of action, as this is totally unexcusable behavior from a company that I respected at one time (hell I was even a Guide for a short term). <P> <BR>-Colla-Rodcet-<BR>Station Member   posted 02-18-2001 12:20 AM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>hehe *nudge*<BR>You guys think this is fair in the least? I'm not saying what I did was right, but it sure wasn't anything even remotely justifing a ban.<BR> <BR>-Colla-Rodcet-<BR>Station Member   posted 02-18-2001 12:23 AM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>If you guys want the complete logs and/or GM Henderson's response to this matter lemme know either here or e-mail me at: [EDITED]. <P><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]

This is not legal and I know it isn't and I will fight it'<BR>&gt;&gt;<BR>Break it down:<BR>You have no power to do this. = A statment<BR>You have no idea who I am. = The GM doesn't realize who the player is, including past experiences, probably including GM's etc.<BR>Its not legal and I know it isn't = Opinion basically.<BR>I will fight it = Again a statement, saying he will fight this decision.<P>No were in there was a personaly threat made towards the GM.<P>Again I said, its a d!ck move to sell someone something, and then if/when they drop it to pick it up again to keep it.

But<BR>&gt; I could be wrong.<P>Although I'll agree that this line might be a threat but certainly not a clear one. <BR>If you read the logs, it was made AFTER the GM asked the player if he was threatening him. That wasn't the line the player was accused of threatening the GM on.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Maybe so, but I don't see how it could have banned him.  Well, if they CARE about their customer's.  Where I did tech support we cared.  We would go out of our way.  Did we boot the ones that got violent on the phone, or wrote dirty emails, or even threatened?  Nope. We noted it (just in case something did happen) and moved on with business.<P>I guess the game industry is different.  You don't have to care about customers.  You can treat them how you want.  I agree with the suspension, but not the banning.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The honorable thing would have been to find the person and hand them back the item.<P>What strikes me as obscene though - is why a GM would be willing to go through this for one player - yet they treat another player who lost part of an epic quest for the same 'bug'..err..feature.<P>Everyone please read http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061474.html  and see if you can figure out where the justice is ?   Reading these two posts side by side makes me ill.  It would be nice to get a comment from Alan or someone from Verant on this.

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;I would like to know how they could track down who picked it up if it was not you. I did not think their servers tracked such things. &lt;&lt;<P>They track it now.  However, it is inconsistent on whether you can get GM support if you lose your WS, whether to accident or fraud.  Some GM's/guides will help you; some will even intervene, and others tell you, "Tough luck."  I'm all for freedom of judgement, but in the interest of fairness, they need to make a policy on this one.  (And the policy should be to return dropped items to the rightful owner, if you ask me.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
