</FONT><HR>Hiya Absor,<P>I don’t know if your still reading this or not but I read what you had to say and I need to point out a few things I think you missed.<P>1. It would help hugely if you could get a magic based DD added at 53 or 54th.  We got 1 at 44th and suffer till 57th for our next one.  In playing time that can be quite a few months.  54th is such a fun level most players stay in it for a good amount of time enjoying it.  This means we go without a magic based DD for a Looonnngggg time.<P>2. You didn’t say anything about our epic.  I am very interested on what Verant thinks about this issue.  Seems to me that this has to be the worst epic in the game. Not in terms of power but in terms of getting it.  It would seem to me for epics to be balanced they should exist on all servers in about equal numbers (per class  i.e. 20 rogue epics on a server about 20 epics for every other class on that server) but I know that’s not true (its not even close) and you should look into it.  Fix the epics please.<P>3. If we are talking about spell effects on Robes I would like to suggest you get the Dev team to think things thru.  I was not impressed by summon bandages on boots.  Or yet another item with reclaim energy.  I know magicians lack low level spells that are worthwhile to have at high levels but surely there is something you can do?  How about summon coldstone?  I get more requests for that then for bandages. Or the 8th level pet heal? (you might get people who will complain that spell is useless at that level but hey I am more likely to use it then summon bandages).  I am just kinda tired of spell effects on items I don’t want or don’t need. <P>4. CoTH I also think it should work in all zones or across zones.  It boggles my mind you make a spell for the specific purpose of bypassing stuff in zones.  Then say it does not work in these zones because you don’t want us to bypass the content.  I also do not see how pulling people from across zones is unbalancing.  I have had people make bank runs tho and it sure would have been nice to save the time and pull em back soon as they were done banking then having to wait for them to run all the zones again to get back to our zone.  I am also sure sky would be more used AND the mage epic easier to get if CoTH hero worked in that zone. And before you say it, easier is not automatically unbalanced.  You wonder why some zones never get used?  Wonder no more.  I’ll tell you.  Its because the zone was made TO MESSED UP.  <P><BR>thanks for the read.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>So I read through looking for posts by Absor, and I see them, much to my surprise.  So, first I must say, to those of you whining about how Absor isn't listening, that's a bunch of garbage.<P>I didn't see if there was a follow up on Absor's statement that the Voceration and Greater Voceration fire pets were suggested to him as being not quite as good as the 29 pets, but I will check this later, since I am 32, and I know someone with those spells.<P>What I'd like to see, is people really working towards important core issues.  All the fluff is good, but it takes away resources from more important issues.<P>I was just in Cazic Thule, and we had a group of casters, sitting and nuking some alligators and lizards, that were just sitting on a bridge, doing nothing, due to pathing.  They'd just wait until their mana came back due to the enchanter, and nuke some more.  Hey, I want free experience too.  Pathing is more than a problem for mages, it's a problem everywhere.<P>On that note however, I was solo'ing to get from 30-31, because the experience was so slow, and I found something interesting.  At similar levels, most caster classes, have to rest if they solo upwards of 5 separate pulls.  A lot of people said simply, they could only manage 2.  Without any buffs, other than my own, with full mana, I could take 10.  With two bubbles of mana, I took upwards of 5.  That's with little danger or difficulty.  Yes, we're talking blue mob pulls, but the comparison remains the same in regards to other caster classes having to rest.<P>While I saw a VERY convincing argument that magicians have a low role in the high level game, and that this isn't a big deal, because so few players actually get there....it's still important.  If the class distinctions don't carry over, what's the point of having them?  After doing some personal research, I've come to the following conclusions, which may or may not be agreed with.<P>I'll start with a question, what's the point of having a spell to lower magic resistances, if it's resisted?<P>I don't think pets should be compared to players, I think we're using the wrong basis of comparison.  I think that pets should be compared to mobs, of similar levels to the pet.  After all, the pet is more like an NPC than a player by far.  However, the pet NPC's ability and strength should be taken into account when comparing the mage PC to the other PC classes.  I agree that resistances are probably a problem, because I see areas where they're problems now, and shouldn't be, logically speaking.<P>The biggest problem, is hunting in general at higher levels is supposed to be incredibly difficult for all classes, increasingly difficult as your levels raise.  So my suggestion, which will make me VERY unpopular is a combination of nerfing and empowering of classes.  Perhaps nerfing the tanks should be looked into, at post 50 levels, as well as empowering the int casters.  To a point of balance, not to create another rift where the casters become more powerful....this would defeat the purpose.<P>The biggest problem is that we can't please everyone.  It's impossible.  Right now, the post 50 game is suffering more, as far as magicians are concerned, than the lower levels.  There are some things that could be changed\added at lower levels, but, the problems become increasingly evident as you increase level.<P>I only got to about the middle of page 3 in the string of posts, so when I have time later, I intend to read the rest.  If I've addressed things others have already suggested, I apologize for wasting additional time.<P>While others probably won't say this, my appreciation to Absor for looking into the issue, no matter the list he comes up with, so that at least some problems are addressed.  To those whining, I'd like to add, at least something here is better than nothing.<P><BR> - Kortai Kiltspar<BR>          Harbringer of Chaos<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just for condesning sake I will label what Mages see as a Balance issue as opposed to stuff that should be fixed regardless, and will only Number the Issues addressed instead of copying them over.<BR>1. Balance Issue<BR>2. Balance Issue<BR>3. General Game Issue<BR>4. Balance Issue<BR>5. Balance Issue<BR>6. General Game Issue. Spell drops seem to be hosed for a lot of other classes too.<BR>7. Trivial "Nice to Have" Issue<BR>8. Trivial "Nice to Have" Issue<BR>9. Trivial "Nice to Have" Issue<BR>10. Balance Issue<BR>11. Balance Issue<BR>12. Trivial "Nice to Have" Issue. I have survived 35 levels without an upgrade and actually got the spell itself as an addition to the game at level 35. Never was a big issue with me.<BR>13. Balance Issue<BR>14. Balance Issue<BR>15. Balance Issue<BR>16. Trivial "Nice to Have" Issue<BR>17. Trivial "Nice to Have" Issue<BR>18. Balance Issue. Mage research sucks big time.<BR>19. Balance Issue. We get Velocity at 58 but that's way to late to be useful. A Mage should get a minor, Jboots speed, spell for their pet at level 34, which is around when normal people get Jboots themselves.<BR>20. General Gameplay Issue. All Charge items will show 1 charge left even if no charges are left until the person zones. Then it will show up correctly. I think the issue here is why all the other Levitate spells cost 30 mana and are gotten at level 14 (39 for Rangers) while ours costs 100 mana, has only 2 charges, and is gotten at 39.<BR>21. Trivial "Nice to Have" Issue. Not having 1HB never killed me before as I do not Melee. The issue here is why all the staves have Useless effects. And are Lore.<BR>22. Totally Missed the mark here. The Issue is why the item is NO DROP, in additon to being unequippable in the Range Slot. I would rather summon 2 Dagger of Symbols and get both 10MR and 10PR than get 1 Shard of the Core for it's 15PR and 15CR.<BR>23. This was fixed. I got it off Juggs this past weekend. The Issue is the level 54 Water pet. I also got that off of Juggs. Kind of rediculous to get a level 54 spell off of level 57 Mobs eh?<BR>24. Trivial "Nice to Have" Issue. I have lived this long without em, I can live longer.<P>So out of the 24 items listed only 11 are Balance Issues as seen by the Mage Community. Umm, what happened?<P>Also, go back and read my post. It covers most of the things that didn't make your list, and that we Mages see as Balance.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor...just having no means of escape while running is the drawback of the magician class?<P>No mana regen, pets sucking 50% of our xp, useless spell lines, total reliance on pets that can wander off and aggro mobs...I mean I'm sorry, the mage is a great class and all, but if you want drawbacks we have plenty already.  How many times do mages have to ask for a shadowstep type spell?  What's the big drawback for necros (since we're talking balance)...only one I can see is being KoS in a number of places...I don't think I've seen them upset over that, because it isn't anything like the size drawback that mages have.

</FONT><HR>Absor:<P>You posted that our pets were good escape mechanisms for open zones.  While under a few limited circumstances this is true, for most circumstances, it is false.<P>If a mage has a pet up, and is jumped by only 1 mob, then his pet is a great escape tool.<P>If a mage does not have a pet up, it's 10 seconds to cast one.. no mage is going to get a 10 second spell of when getting beat on.<P>If a mage gets jumped by 2 mobs, dead mage.<P>I could provide more examples, but I'm sure you get the idea.  Mage's need some sort of escape spell, a 3 second cast summon spell with a charge of root, snare, blind, fear etc. would help.  The fact that it's an item w/charge inherently makes it more difficult than just having the normal spell (ie it's easier to just root then to cast the summon spell, put it in a general inventory slot, then click it).<P><BR>Thanks for your time.<P>Kraquen Manamaul<P>Ero Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
