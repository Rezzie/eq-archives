</FONT><HR>&gt;Everyone makes mistakes but VI seem to make the same mistakes over and over again. They have demonstrated time and time again that there is little (or no) QA or it's at an extremely poor level. <P>You know that is the thing that gets me the most.  Let's take a recent example.  The placement of the inventory descriptions when you right click on an item or the name when you right click on a spell effect.  I honestly want an explanation of how that happened?  You directly  and diliberately changed a feature of the game and yet you did not check the effect of what you did at all?  You add some kind of change with the intent to make this information display differently, but you dont actually try it once you make the change.  Right click on an item, see that the text overlaps the green "connection" bar (not sure what the official name for it is), see that the text overlaps spell slots and is difficult to read.  That took what?  3 seconds</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I put up this post as a reply, but I feel the only way to get my point out is too start a new thread.<BR>Patches have to be done. This game is just too big to not be constantly fixing bugs. Due to the games popularity, it is also expanding. Every single game you have ever played is constently updating and patching their game as well, so this isn't unique to EQ. I remeber that when Diablo II came out, even before it hit the shelves a patch was already up online to fix the bugs that the testers had just discoverd.<P>Now I live in the PST, but since I am a vampire (well not really, but since I keep virtually the same hours as one, I think I should get some of their cool super powers) I am effect by patches much the same way Eurpean or Asian players are. With that said lets consider this for a moment.<P>At your job, would you rather A.) Do lots of work or B.) Do less work, get paid the same. Hmmmm, tough choice here. I would choose B, I am sure you would too. Customer Service Reps. for EQ are the same way. Let's look at some numbers, shall we...<P>During patch times, there are about 400-600 people on per server. These same 400-600 people are constently effected by the patches. Right now they are on their 4th patch in a row. Now those players on at non peak times want at least 1 of these patches done at peak times, so the same people arn't being effected by downtime. The average amount of players per server at peak time is between 1200-1800. So, lets say that 10% of people actually contact customer service and complain about downtime (I know 10% is not acurate, but for this purpose, it is an easy number to work with). So once a day, Customer service has to deal with 40-60 unhappy customers per server. Over a 4 day period that is 1600-2400 complaints per sever. Now lets say they moved one of the patches to peak hours. Now on that patch day they have to deal with 120-180 complaints per server on 1 day (keep in mind there are some 37 servers). That is 3 times the work normally for customer service reps on that one day, PLUS, they still have to deal with the normal complaint flowage on the other 3 days. Seems to me that is more work for them. If I had there job, I would not want that, so I would try to get the patches arranged for the least amount of work for me. Wouldn't you do the same.<P>Now some of you will argue, that it isn't good customer service to do it that way. The same people are getting disgruntled night after night, eventually they will loose customers right. Well first of all, if all of you are as addictided to the game as I am, you will suffer through this week, maybe gripe a little, and then move on with both my real, an Norrathian life. If you are one of the very few who are turned off by the constent patches, well, keep in mind that EQ is probably the most successful online game to date. Hence people have all made there money already, and the very tiny amount of customers they might loose just really doesn't phase them. It would probably cost them more money in labor to handle the extra work-load if they did a patch during peak hours, then the very few of you who sadly, will quit EQ because of it.<P>Now the refund issue. Many people say "fine, do a bunch of patches, just give me a refund for my time lost." Well, that refund, prorated would probably be about $1.00 but, the $10.00 a month that we pay is to keep the servers up and running smoothly. So by paying them $10 a month you are saying "I would rather loose playing time so that bugs are fixed and unfair advantages are nulled, and a fun role playing enviorment in maintaned" People, you pay the money for them to do these patches, so don't count on a refund.<P>Before we get all in a hissy about a situation that isn't too our liking, perhaps we should look at it from the othersides prespective, rather than our own selfish one.<P>P.S. Sorry for the spelling mistakes, it is 3:00 in the morning, and I'm not a good speller to begin with = /<P>Salival<BR>17 Warrior and Master Smith<BR>Lanys T'Vyl<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>  300,000 people now have active EQ accounts at 10 dollars a month thats about 3million dollars.  If we are paying you 3million dollars can you at least listen to us instead of saying sorry you havent been able to play for the past week we had to nerf more things.  I might be wrong but it seems to me that all these patches are done mainly to nerf things in Velious. Granted there were some problems with screenshots and the UI and other stuff but all that should have been fixed in one patch.  Actually it should have been fixed before the game came out on the market.  My biggest question is, was this game beta tested?  It would seem not.  Oversights like this is why I will be so glad when games like Shadowbane come out.  Hopefully everything worthwhile will not be nerfed on that game like it is here.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I haven't bought SoV and I won't buy it either. I bought Kunark and I still spend 90% of my time in the old part of the game. Why buy it and just give these guys more of my money. It is obvious they don't care enough to rotate the downtimes, much less to test their products before they shove them on the market. maybe SoV was created for one reason, because of several new on-line games that are about to hit the market. we may not continue to pay ten bucks a month for much longer, but this was their last chance to get the twenty bucks for SoV. I know that's a cynical way of looking at it, but at this point that's all I have for Verent.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Two things here:<P>First, I wish more people had played UO before this.  UO servers go down *every day*.  Not for eight hours, but it's regular.  So I still feel kinda spoiled by EQ not shutting down every morning.<P>THAT SAID, the people at OSI recognized the international users quite early and set up Asian and European servers.  Why Verant, with such a massive GLOBAL parent company like Sony hasn't done this is a complete mystery.  Plus, the international servers come down in the afternoon/evening US time so as not to interfere with peak playing times in the different time zones.<P>I think Verant should set aside *at least* one international server for foreign customers only.  Otherwise it would get flooded by the rest of us during patch hours. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There isn't really much I have to add; it's pretty much all been said allready.  This week's down time has been unaceptable.  I'm ok with once a week patches, but this is too much.<P>As for those who ask for some sort of compensation, all I have to say is that there is no way that they could determine who WOULD have played durring these times, and they aren't going to give the whole population money or a free month or whatever.  That would just be too much.<P>Call me a psycic, but I believe their going to have a patch next Monday or Tuesday.  I just hope that *maybe* they can switch their timing to 12pm pst (or around there)  This has been just too much.<P>Here's to hopping that Testing Procedures are improved, and downtime looked at.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"And considering the shorter production time on this product and the ambitious nature of the product, I think we've done a fair job."<P>Well, really I don't think that cuts it.  "FAIR" would mean you test an expansion before going live with it.  "FAIR" would mean that you test interface changes before going live.  "FAIR" would mean test patches so that they don't have to be re-patched.  "FAIR" would mean refunding paying subscribers for lost service time, as any reputable service would.<P>I work in the motion picture industry in a post production capacity and I am no stranger to getting lengthy technical and quality assurance processes completed before deadlines.  Post is never a leisurely process given that there is always a fesival deadline that has to be met.  Often a film is accepted to a festival mid-post, so when the actual deadline for a completed print is established, the post process has to be accellerated to meet that deadline.  Often it comes down to the wire.  This is not what has happend here.  YOU set the deadline on Velious and YOU could have pushed it back when it wasn't ready.  No one has requiered you or your parent companies to release this product NOW, clearly before it is ready.<P>The bottom line here is, what you call "ambitious" in running Velious out the door before it's ready, I call exactly what it is:  Releasing a product before it's ready with ONLY one concern in mind--Getting it on the shelves before Christmas so that YOU can reap holday sales, with no concern for existing or even new subscribers who can't use it with all the downtime.  Had you done a poll of players asking if they would prefer for Velious to be pushed out the door NOW with a week of near-constant downtime or after the holidays with minimal downtime, I think we all know what the answer would be.<P>A CHALLENGE--&gt;  I would really love to see an OFFICIAL RESPONSE as to why Verant feels a refund or credit is not warranted.  I think this response would speak volumes as to how Verant REALLY regards it's customers.  Sure, you always hem and haw thanking us for our patience and making lame excuses, but ONE fact remains unaddressed:  A service which thousands of people have paid for is not being consistently rendered.  If you really appreciate your customers, Verant, why don't you put your money where your mouth is?<P>Al<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hmm. Five patches, in five days. All at the same time of day. No staggering of start times.<P>Well, it was to be expected that a few things would be missed, true. And maybe even a couple of patches would be  needed. And yes, it makes sense to annoy as few people as possible.<P>But really, minimise the annoyance by rotating patch times! At least a little!<P>And don't you think it's strange, that even after four consecutive patches, there has STILL been no update to the bugged tradeskills which were implemented weeks ago, or even to an item (the wisdom deity, if you care) that we were told would be fixed _on the next item patch_ some three weeks ago?<P>One thing that is annoying is that this is something that even those who haven't bought Velious are suffering. No way to avoid it!<P>Hell, I might even like the patches when I finally get Velious. When does it come out? 5th? no, the 8th. no, wait, it's the 13th. 14th. no, England gets the 15th. that's firm, honest.<P>still waiting...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Non-US players, in the grand scheme of things, are irrelevant! The bottom line is all that is important, and Verant is certainly not alone in that philosophy.

</FONT><HR>I disagree with Absor for the most part.  We, as customers, know the transition times for the last two expansions.  I don't think this one is better then Kunark.<P>I think the Kunark one went much better then this one.  This one seems to have been a much greater problem with more drastic problems.<P>If it had improved there wouldn't be so many unfixed problems.  I see some focus on fixing the interface problems related to this but there were just as many, and even more, problems associated with this patch even though they are working on interface related issues.  These issues should have been worked out a long time ago.  Sheesh, we've had interface changes being done for the past couple of months, why so many more now, and why all the problems associated with it?<P>Anyway, Absor seems to be putting the spin control on the subject.  I think it is just a mind game to try to get cool things down.  I told them once that patches should go in and have problems fixed en-masse rather then piece-meal like now.  I wish they'd get it together and do just that.  I know I'm tired of playing beta tester for them.
