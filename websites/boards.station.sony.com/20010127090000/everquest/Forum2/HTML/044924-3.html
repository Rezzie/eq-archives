</FONT><HR>Since you took the time to answer me, I will do the same Brad  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>1. Halved the experience lost due to death.<P>True, that was in the first 6 months? And it was needed, and praised at the time. But it does not really affect "downtime" as such. Make up time yes for a death, but you still (if a melee) need to make that long-ass run from the bind point 3-4 huge zones away...<P>But not belittling the result, just does not apply here.<P>2. Increased boat speeds<P>If you did, it was not announced (or I did not see it announced), but appreciated, still boring though, I asked way back when for a license for a casino on them, can I get an update?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>3. Increased range for evac and teleport spells<P>Again, a good thing, but really does not apply here that I see, evac in Kunark is almost silly though since most of them send you to a "safe" area that will kill you faster then where you were, of course that is not true in the "old" world, and am not familiar will all the $oV ones yet so no opinion. Simply pray you have a cleric in the zone that will res you. Once again making clerics the #1 class to desire, and flooded with pleas.<P>4. Added a second boat between Freeport and Butcherblock<P>Which still scrapes you off on random places when it brushes a rock, or lags out and dumps you on the dock at sister isle. And gets stuck itself. Still a good effort.<P>5. Increased treasure and experience gain rewards for many older quests<P>Um, what? Again, how does this relate to downtime? I thought that was the topic, at least it was of my post. As to increased rewards and exp? Do you mean like the epic quests that Gordon bragged was so bug free and therefore no help of any kind would be provided? And no help is STILL forthcoming after so many bugs have shown up in them.<P>Be that as it may, until the reward for a particular quest equals the exp that i could have aquired by being in a group fighting yellows and reds instead of chasing green MOBs to get rare drops it will never be "worth" it for that alone.<P>6. Implemented Specialization<P>Yes? And what exactly is that supposed to mean? If it works at all there is, what, a .0001% chance of using 1% less mana to cast a spell? it sure does not shorten the casting times, or with some of the higher level spells does it help with the fizzle rate. And of course that fizzle rate increases the downtime needed to recover.<P>7. Enhanced High Level (35+) Meditation<P>Not staring at the book does not decrease downtime, it just makes it a touch safer (not a bad thing) and more senic. <P>8. Reduced many spells' mana costs<P>You mean like my lvl 55 shaman PET ????????????<P>9. Added Summon Corpse<P>Because you made MOB's that gate and summon. Even some yard-trash do that now. Plus you made it as a very farmable drop, not very nice.<P>10. Added Call of the Hero<P>Which you proptly nerfed...<P>11. Given more classes resurrection family spells<P>Which does give us a tad more choice in group members. Not as much as you seem to assume(remember what assuming does? Makes an Ass of U and Me) since if there is one slot open, and there is a choice between a paladin and a cleric, which do you think will be chosen? But hey, I'll give you a pass on this.<P>12. Added more resurrection family spells<P>Guess all the screaming got to you  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>13. Improved Tracking<P>Fixed it you mean, fianlly after almost 2 years, but hey, you did fix it. In a lot of ways anyway. Still does not relate to downtime. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I do like the notion of balancing risk and reward by changing the experience penalty for death in some of the more out of the way dungeons, in addition to the current setup where the risks are supposedly balanced by the greater rewards.  Although, if I were the game czar, I would be tempted to _increase_ the death penalties in cities and in the zones adjacent to cities.<P>I find that the most efficient way to reduce travel downtime is not to travel - pick a spot and hunt there for a while.  Some folks will take as many as 10 LEVELS in the same zone.  I get bored after three bubbles or less, but I do try to get 3 gaming sessions in before shifting my bind point.  That said, I play EQ for the exploration, for the fun of working out new tactics and zones, and then for the roleplay.  I do not race to level.  I wonder if the number of people who complain about getting bored with EQ is related to the fact that not travelling is the most time-efficent way to level.  <P>In addition, many folks in the 50+ range do a lot of raids.  Raids involve travel.  Travel is downtime.  <P>What if you added a wizard spell to teleport to the firepot room, but had it require a soulbound key that could only be picked up IN the firepot room?  Ideally this should be a wizard spell at the appropriate level for people to hunt in the revised version of Permafrost.<P>Of all the travel moments, waiting for the boat and sitting on the boat are the worst.  When I travel by boat with an unguilded character, I read a book while waiting to zone.  Even with a guilded character, the book comes out sometimes.  It would be nice if there were more to do at the docks.  I am reminded of the story of a large office building where everyone complained about the slow elevators and the time spent waiting for them to arrive.  The building managers looked at the problem, and then installed mirrors next to the elevators.  The elevators travelled at the same speed, but now people were able to primp in the mirror and they did not notice the wait because they had something to do.  <P>It would be great if there were a forge, oven, brew barrel etc at the docks in the Butcherblock.  Add some vendors and the place would become the trade-skills mecca for Faydwer.  <P>It would be nice if we could fish from the boat, or use merchants on the boat, or something.  <P>As an aside, many of the arguments here seem to be the flip side of the discussions about which melee classes are most effective.  I play a Ranger, currently level 40 after 12 months of play and some 42 "days" played.  I generally do not get much downtime from deaths, while warriors of the same level complain bitterly.  Camoflage at 15 helps a LOT, and SoW at 39 helps more.  The pure melees reduce downtime by being more effective in combat, while hybrids reduce it in other ways.  I almost always can run back to my corpse in the time it takes my group to get me a rez.  <P>Hope this was useful</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The problem with the downtime is not the extra downtime that is incurred when things go bad.<P>The problem with downtime, is that it is simply *required* no matter what you do.<P>Take for example, a full group of players 30-35 hutning HG's in rathe. Lets assume that the party is well-balanced, they have a druid, cleric, rogue, warrior, enchanter and wizard.<P>No matter how skillfull or even twinked this group is, they are going to have stop, sit on thier kiesters, and twiddle their thumbs and talk about the weather for while. This is downtime, and it only gets worse the higher you go.<P>You assert in your post Brad about how if the game wasnt all that fun poeple would move on, and not play that part? Well guess what, here's some news for you.<P>Why is that of the 11 RL friends of mine that play, each one has a toon at least 30+, all but 4 have at least one of 40 +, and 2 have 50+. Guess what, they dont play those guys.<P>Hmm....couldnt be because the downtime at those levels is extended....nah, they are ALL lying when they say that, arent they?<P>Just some food for thought.<P>Also....consider the number of twinks. Why do poeple twink? Easy....they get *tired and bored* of their highbies.<P>They wouldnt twink and play lower level alts, if they were having all that fun at the high end, would they?<P>Nah, as always, the player is wrong, and the vision is right. Your entire post, all 3 of them, reek of spin about how great a job you are doing, and not paying attention to what is really being said. You foster the discussion, then shoot down whatever is said.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would like to thank Aradune for what is in my view a well-considered response.  I (and others) have been complaining for a while about the lack of communication on these issues.  Sometimes you just need an acknowledgement that you exist and that you "count", as well as an acknowledgement that there is some validity to your issues.<P>I realize these are tough issues, but this response at least causes me to feel they are recognized and that there will be some effort to deal with them.  That's all I have asked for.<P>I do want to comment on one point:<P>&gt;&gt;Wow, one of best counter arguments posted, giving me much to think about - thanks. As for your conclusion, though, it seems to be contradictory. 'Risk' fundamentally implies a penalty for failure. The greater the risk, the greater the penalty (and hopefully, the reward). IMHO, Reducing penalties doesn't encourage risk taking without also reducing the risk itself.&lt;&lt;<P>I have to disagree with this conclusion.  For me, reducing penalties absolutely, positively encourages me to take more risks (without reducing the risk).  I am one who *loves* high risk ... whether soloing or grouping I love to take on those yellows and reds where there is a small possibility of success but a high probability of failure.  But when people are facing, say, 8 hours of work to overcome a death, it's really tough to get them to do it.  Likewise, when soloing, I really do avoid these high risks more and more with my higher guys simply because of the magnitude of the penalty.  If the penalty were more reasonable, I would continue to take the risks, and it would be easier to find others willing to join in.<P>As one example, I don't remember exactly what level this was, but there came a point when I decided to go try to solo spectrals in Traks Teeth with my cleric (this was well before he had level 49 res, so the penalty for death was serious).  I died on my first effort, but it seemed possible, so I decided that I was GOING to stand there and continue this until I won.  After another death or two and 2-3 zone-out escapes, I got one by the skin of my teeth.  A couple friends who were on at the time asked my why I was doing this.  My response was that it's FUN!  And, indeed it was .. I refined my technique more and more, spent the entire afternoon there soloing them, and didn't quit until I got all my lost exp back.  Net gain in exp and loot: zero.  Net gain in fun: outstanding.  Frankly, this session was as enjoyable as anything I have ever done in the game. BUT, if I hadn't been able to temper the penalty with level 39 res, I really wonder if I would have done it. ENCOURAGE risk-taking ... it's great fun ... and, in my view, this game is superb at presenting fascinating challenges.<P><BR>Anyway, again thanks for the well-considered response  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>My issue with downtime is the same as my issue with monster balance, class balance, and similar topics.  And this is this:  Verant doesn't know when to stop.<P>Let's look at monster balance.  Because monster AI is not as creative as player brains, says Verant, the monsters need to be compensated.  I can accept that.  But look at the list of compensation:<P>1 - Have many more hitpoints than a player of the same level.<BR>2 - Hits harder than a player of the same level.<BR>3 - Hits more often than a player of the same level.<BR>4 - Can cast spells about 3 times faster than players.<BR>5 - Can cast on the run.<BR>6 - Can cast around corners and through walls.<BR>7 - Can Gate from combat and return to home point...HEALED.<BR>8 - Can summon.<BR>9 - Can have no weapons but hit players while the player is told the monster is "out of reach."<BR>10 - Can mix classes.  I've seen "Cleric" monsters who multi-hit for over 100 points damage!  Meanwhile, my cleric is ecstatic if he gets over 30 with his Flail!<P>I'm sure there's more, but I'll stop there.  I have no problem with a monster getting a couple items to compensate for being stupid...but more often, the monster doesn't get 2, or 3...but ALL TEN.  That's not compensation at all.<P>Now, with the downtime issue, we see a similar situation.  When you die, there should be a penalty, yes.  But look at "the" penalty.<P>1 - Body with equipment falls to the foot of the monster you're fighting.  You reappear at the bind point naked.<BR>   1A: Most "corpse recovery" tools are on the body and thus "lost".<BR>   1B: Corpse recovery must now take place while essentially naked.  I don't know about you, but the juggernauts are hard enough to manage when fully armored.<P>2 - Corpse Recovery:<BR>   2A: Melees are now, potentially, miles away from that body.<BR>   2B: Even with Summon Corpse, melee types must now run (naked) from town to the dungeon to be summoned.<BR>   2C: Now we have this ridiculous "dragro" issue in SoV making corpse recovery even more difficult.  It may be difficult to imagine, Verant, but some of us *do* play solo sometimes and don't have an legion of assistants at our beck and call.  A wrong turn, or run into the tail end of a train in KD, and it is not just tough, but *impossible* to get your body back.  With Woushi in Wakening Lands...same thing.<P>3 - Experience points are lost.  Far more are lost than the monster would have given.<BR>   3A: Even with top resurrection, experience points recovered fall short of the experience points lost.  Some remain gone.<P>4 - After corpse recovery:<BR>   4A: If resurrected, we have Res-effects.<BR>   4B: If not resurrected, all lost exp is still lost.<P>5 - Groups must reform, party must refight *back* to the point of death -or- groups are disheartened or it's too late and raid dissolves.<P>So you see, we have the same situation.  We do not have *a* penalty, we are saddled with multiple penalties all which apply.  Over penalization.<P>I don't think the game should be a "gimme" but neither do I think that "challenge" is equal to "impossible."  And I believe that death is penalty enough without heaping insult on top of injury.<P>There are solutions, most quite easy, that can be used to fix these and still keep the "challenge."<P>1: Melee binding.  Put safe spots (really safe ones, unlike some we've seen) in each, or 'every other' non-dungeon zone where melees can bind.  But make them work for it.  To bind, they have to go to their home town (there's a trek) and buy from their guildleader a ring of binding.  This ring is lore, no-drop, and reasonably expensive (that's reasonably, not outrageously).  Now, the melee, if he seeks to rebind, must then get to the binding point (say one of those obelisks we see here and there) and use the ring to bind there.<P>2: Experience point loss: The monster only takes as much experience as he would have given.  Or you do not lose exp, but incur a "exp debt" (similar to AC) in which your stats are somewhat (reasonably so) until that debt is earned back.  Cleric Resurrections then remove 50%, 90%, 96% of that debt.<P>3: Corpse Recovery: I played UO for a while, and when you died there, you were given the option of instant reanimation or playing as a ghost.  To aid in corpse recovery, we could be given options as well.  A box could pop up that gives us some options to ease part of the pain while still maintaining some challenge.  Some of the options could be:<BR>   3A: Corpse stays where it is, you go back to dungeon zone-in.<BR>   3B: Corpse goes to zone, you go to your bind point.<BR>   3C: You go to your bind point--with all your gear, except a few items which remain on a corpse where you died (ala AC)<BR>   3D: Body stays where it is, you go to your bind point and land with a lore, no-drop, ring of corpse summoning which you can use, once in the zone, to summon your body to yourself.  This helps those of us who occassionally get caught without assistance.  The ring is *not* no-rent, because LD's happen, but (in order to keep people from trying to "save" one) once you start looting your body the ring vanishes.<P>Those are just sample ideas, and some can be tweaked to keep "balance."  For instance the Ring-of-Recovery might seem to make Necros useless, but that can be balance by making the body non-resurrectable, so the exp debt must be worked off.  If you don't adopt the exp-debt, then perhaps a 96% Revivisence is "too powerful for your target" and the body can only be res'd with a 90% res instead.<P>There are ways to actually achieve balance without over-penalizing the players.<P>Lonzrick L'Amore<BR>Xev<P>-----------------------------------<BR>BTW: I enjoyed the reply about how you make more money from casual gamers versus addicts.  It was good.  But even more so, it was an excellent example of spin-doctoring the facts.<P>Yes, you do get more money from casual gamers...while they have accounts.  But casual gamers are the ones who are more likely to cancel their accounts outright because they find something more suitable to their limited time constraints.  Casual gamers are more likely to play for 2 months then quit (for a net of only $20 plus original software), than the powerplayers who have played for 18 months or more.  Therefore, Verant does *actually* make more money from the power-gamers than the casual.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Brilliant Idea #1<BR>One of the biggest problems with travel is that you have to meander through zone after zone to get where you truly want to go because of the way zonelines are set up. Take a page from BG II for a second. When you zone, you get a world map with places that are adjacent to where you are now that you want to go. Instead of having all zones have one zone in to one zone out, give us the ability to pick which adjacent zone we want to go to. That alone would cut some serious travel time. <BR>Brilliant idea#2<BR>Automate boat transport. Utilize the follow comand when targetting the boat/shuttle to automatically transport you from said shuttle/boat, to any connecting boats and then to drop you at the LAST dock. This will allow people to still use boats as they are now, jump off whenever/whereever they want AND it will allow those that just want to get to that destination to get up from computer, and when they come back be where they want to go. <P>Brilliant idea #3<BR>Make the boats on a set in-gametime schedule. Post that schedule  in the user manual, online, and at each dock. By knowing when a boat will be at each stop, this will allow players to plan trips a heck of alot better than they can now. The sound idea of when a boat comes in is neat, but by the time that you get to say Butcherblock docks, that boat is long gone. Better to know ahead of time when a boat will be here than wait for a sound.<P>Brilliant Idea #4<BR>Make boat trips useful. Place vendors on them that will allow you to stock up, get drunk, practice a tradeskill, or just generally do SOMETHING. What makes you bored? Doing nothing. What are the vast majority of the complaints about downtime based on? Being bored by doing nothing. By coming up with a way to make downtime fun, you can minimize (not eliminate) boredom. If placing vendors on the boats is a technical nightmare then load them buggers up at the docks. There is no reason why you can't have every kind of merchant easily accessible by every dock.<P>Brilliant Idea #5<BR>Make boats connect at more ports. Butcherblock to Odus, Oasis to dock on going to kerra Isle. Make Odus a viable place to go to, and want to go to. Not only does Tox forest need a redo, but give it more access and quicker access. By sending a boats to more places, you increase different starting points on each continent. You want the thrill of running from FP to Qey? Great, knock yourself out, but the boat should take you from BB to FP to Qey. Raft should go from Oasis to Tox forest to Tim deep. Open up where one can go safely, and faster than a overland route. That's what boats are for.<P>My 2cps,<BR>Newwen Runemaster<BR>51st season channeler<BR>L'malla<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I would like to see down time trimmed, myself.  Granted it should exist as a challenge when the result of good, experienced play can minimize it. But ... <P>Casters still recover mana somewhat slow. Mana should recover slow enough not to affect the outcome of a battle (ie, shouldnt be able to recover half your mana battle medding for 30 sec) but fast enough that your not down for 20 min because something got nasty and all the casters had to fully discharge.<P>And of course, travel time, mostly at higher levels.  Thier is absolutely no challange for a level 50 to run thrugh about 95% of the zones. Its just long and boring, half the time i use autorun and go afk.  Thier just needs to be a better way to do repetetive travel.  Tradeskills just aggrevate the problem.. ive gotta run here to fetch this, then there to fetch that. Work blacksmithing up to 200, please.. then comment.  No challenge or fun in town hopping, just more newbs begging and dirtying my boots to beat off, and and 75% of my time wasted beating feet from one place to another.  Put some no-drop self only teleport items in the game that go to popular spots like nektulos, gfay, Ro, DL, Iceclad that arent some freakish rare drops.  Put really high cast times on them so they cant be used for combat evac. <P>I know for certain, I'll be jumping to the next new game that comes along if something isnt done to fix the fact that 75% of my "playing" is done in autorun or sitting down.<P>Qyen Vimwarder<BR>Vicar of Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>After spending about 35 minutes running from Qeynos to RiverVale, you can imagine my enthusiasm when after 45 minutes I still could not find a bind to the area.  So I had 4 options, wait ad infinitum for someone who could bind, fight in Misty and pray I don't die, Run back to Qeynos, or   what I did, put everything in the bank and Suicide against an NPC and just fight back near my original bind.  After about an hour and a half when you count getting all my supplies out of the bank, what had I accomplished?  Except for the loss of Exp, nothing.  I had no risk, yet I had a negative reward.<P>Would the following suggestion imbalance anything in anyway?  <BR>Allow casters to summon a "Bind Stone" or whatever you wish to call it, costs the same mana as a bind.  The bind stone would allow the user to bind himself in any of the already designated cities.  Perfectly logical, melee's would still rely upon Casters for binds, yet would not be totally dependant on their being a caster in the area, as was the case with me last night.  I fail to see how this would imbalance anything.<P>Beevor</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>There are a few points made by Aradune that I'd like to throw my two cents in on.  The first one is :<P>"Belrath: "Verant - you still have never directly asked me for my opinion on anything other than whether or not I want to renew my subscription. How do you know if I am happy? Do you view every active player as happy because they subscribe? You should poll your players A LOT and get demographics on who thinks what. All these blanket statements about how happy everyone is nonsense."<P>I don't think subscription numbers and churn rates are at all 'nonsense' indicators, rather I think they are ultimately the best way to gauge the success of a product. But I do agree there are other ways to gather information and to learn how to make a better product, including polls. I DO think we should poll more often. Perhaps Absor could start a thread on what you all think we should ask our customer base via polls."<P>Aradune, you forget one thing, an unfortunate affliction called "addiction".  Everquest is an EXTREMELY addictive game (as has been stated many times by many players).  It can almost be equated to smoking in a sense that most smokers say they're not happy smoking, but they do it anyway because they're addicted.  I offer you this thought, "even though most of these people are not happy, they play because they are addicted."<P>I have played EQ for over a year and have also played AC quite a bit, and I can say from experience that I have NEVER in all the time I've played AC heard one player complain about anything but the sound effects.  Every time I log on EQ, I can't get away from the constant complaining from friends and other players shouting across zones and the like.  The majority of people I meet in EQ have gripes, and they don't leave because they're addicted to the game (which is good for you because that turns into revenue).  Let's face facts here, EQ is a business, you're there to make money, and you're going to do whatever it takes to keep the money coming in (ie. making things in the game take longer and thus causing us to play longer).  VI has admitted several times that EQ has a finite lifespan, to that we all agree, and I feel that until such time as the subscriber base begins to drop significantly, we won't see any major changes in "the vision".  Then it will be economically viable for them to try to entice players to stay longer by giving them reasons to WANT to stay other than addiction.<P>-----------------------------------------------<P>And the second is :<P>"Grave_Robber: "Death of a tank could also = death for the entire group as well. Multiple penalties for all in the group. Death = a long wait for the guy to get back."<P>That's an excellent point, and why we feel the melee binding issue is a balance issue for all classes, and that were it changed the entire pace of the game would change also. In other words, the fact that melee classes cannot self-bind and must bind in city zones is part of the death penalty for both melee classes AND non-melee classes."<P>Here's one of those points I'd love to see a poll on.  Do the "bind classes" really care one way or another if melee classes could bind themselves.  I think VI is making a bold assumption in saying that we do care.  Personally, I'd much rather see shamans be able to make a bind potion or even have a bind potion you could buy from a vendor (no i'm not a shaman)  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.  You can buy a gate potion so melees can gate.. why not a bind potion ?  A gate potion doesn't unbalance the game but a bind potion would ?  Hmm.. backward logic to me.  I get very very tired of having people constantly bugging me for binds every time I enter a city, and I'm sure the other "bind classes" can relate.  VI took some of the "SOW plz" stuff off our backs with SOW potions and JBoots.. how about taking some of the "Can you come to the gate and bind me plz" away too.  Class balance is nice, but I seriously doubt the ability to bind one's self would impede the game (other than making things take a little less time, which you've stated you don't want).  And maybe, just maybe it would put a smile on some player's faces  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>In closing, I just want to say that I don't harbor any ill against VI.  It takes a hell of a lot of work to put together and maintain a game of this magnitude. Unfortunately, how ever much I would love to see it work the way it was intended, I really don't think the game buying public was ready for "the vision".  The things that go on in EQ are a direct reflection of things that go on in the real world.  Instead of an escapist fantasy, EQ has started to become just like the real world of "keeping up with the Jonses". Gotta get those items and plat.. gotta keep up with the rest of the people or I'll fall behind.  Its a shame, but the vast majority of people I meet in game subscribe to that philosophy.  I really wish EQ could be more like it was intended to be.. like it was when we all first started playing, full of mystery, sense of danger.. feeling of relief when you walked into your home city.  I truly thought when SOV came out that I might get that feeling again.. I'll never forget the first day it came out and I had my copy installed and rushed over to explore.  I was very impressed with the improved graphics and the new beasts.. until I got to the bottom of the dragon bridge and saw a 55th level mage annihilating cougars over and over and over because he'd gotten an earring off of one.  I ran out into the eastern wastes and saw more high levellers destroying the orc and giant camps because armour had dropped.  16 new adventure zones had transformed into 16 zones of farmland before SOV even had a chance to get fully explored.  Shortly after that day, I stopped playing EQ.<P>- Oliias Moorglade<BR>52nd Wanderer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Brad, you need to go out and have some large banners printed and hung about your offices. They should read:<P>"The game is about fun."<P>Because right now game decisions are not being made with player fun in mind, instead the vision rules all. <P>If you think forcing half the population to run 5 zones to recover a corpse is "fun", you're kidding yourself. To this day I've yet to hear of any reason not to implement some sort of melee binding system from your team, outside of it contradicting the vision.<P>I challenge you to at least try some of the suggestions in this thread. EQ2 is around the corner, as is SW and I'm sure many other fine prodructs from Verant. If, by some off chance, the suggestions here demolished Everquest you would've at least proved your critics wrong: downtime WAS the key factor to a MMORPG, and your upcoming titles will be in stores to pick up the EQ slack.<P>But if you're wrong and downtime isn't the key factor to a good MMORPG, not testing will leave you in the dark to this and you won't be able to use that knowledge in your future products(which will exist in a far more competitive environment).<P>Basically it boils down to: what do you have to lose by trying it out?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One thing that this thread has opened my eyes to more fully is that Everquest is a very penality-centric game and in many places double-penalties exist.<P>I think a lot of it had to do with an initial fear in developing the game that it would be too easy or too exploitable.<P>Remember hybrids used to have a higher spell cost for casting the same spells and a smaller mana pool.  In effect Verant was trying to penalize hybrids for being hybrids.  We can all agree with that.  But they ended up going overboard and penalized them twice for the same thing.<P>I thing this is a fundamental problem with the game.  Too often the playerbase is penalized multiple times in multiple ways for a single mistake.  Sometimes it can reach a frustration point of feeling like you just got run over by a truck.<P>The highs are definately high, but the lows are definately just as low.<P>I think the double-penalty for melee death, for example, is a shining example of all of this.  The experience loss is a time-sink to regain, and you also must run back to your body.  Why not include the triple-threat of corpse recovery as well.<P>Problem is Brad you can easily explain all three of those away by using the assitance of other PC's.  However this is again game designing in the ideal situation only.<P>I challenge you to get the Live team and Development team for future projects to not design gameplay around the IDEAL set of circumstances.  <P>We all understand it is meant to be a social game, and one is meant to make friends and rely on them for assistance.  However it is not reasonable to think that you will always have a Cleric, Necro, Druid/Wizard on and at your disposal.<P>I wish I could scroll back now because someone above made a most excellent point.  You are not rewarding classes that have specific skills, you are punishing classes that don't have those skills.  The reason why it is perceived as punishment as oppose to reward is because it significantly alters ones ability to enjoy the game, especially in a limited amount of regular gameplay.<P>I am glad you want the world to feel vast.  It is incredibly important, especially when someone starts playing the game.  I have been playing the game for 2 years though, and the fact is the perceived size of the world ranges between annoyance and pain in the arse.  It contributes ZERO to my gameplay at this point.  A large chunk of the playerbase have evolved, the game has remained exactly the same.<P>One of my greatest experiences in Everquest was taking my first real character from Qeynos to Freeport at Level 6 and almost making it.  I proceeded to try again at level 8 and made it sucessfully.  It was terrifying. exhilirating and a lot of fun.<P>How many times have I made that same run in either direction with any number of characters since then?  I am guessing if I actually thought about it, and it scares me to do that, it would be in the neighborhood of 200+ times.<P>Do you think I get ANY enjoyment at all from running from Qeynos to Freeport or vice-versa any longer? Not a shred.  Nothing nada zip zilch.  It is simply frustrating and annoying, nothing bt a means to an end.  I am not exactly sure why someone should be penalized for this.<P>Sometimes realism must be sacrificed for gameplay, and gameplay designed around the Perfect group/friends list is not one that is perpetually fun.<P>I have stopped playing EQ several times.  I have 3 different accounts.  I have so many characters I couldn't even began to count my playtime.  But I nnow spend freetime searching the web hoping for a glimpse of some new game that will limit the amount of downtime I face in EQ.<P>Again when it works its great.  You got a druid nearby and you get to your destination fast.  Something goes wrong and a cleric restores experience and if your a melee saves you a run back.  Unfortunately that is not always possible, so instead you dread the times you don't have those people at your disposal.  You also have groups not willing to do things because the penalties are too high.<P>Some people will only have fun if they are level 60 with the best gear in the game.  That is a miniscule part of the population.  The majority of us would love to be able to just play the game.  I think you would see less emphasis on level and loot by the general customer base if the rest of the game was not so tedius.

</FONT><HR>Bind Stone -- Neat idea BTW. =)<P>Some additional thoughts here ...<P>Travel -- In this game, travel can actually dissuade someone from exploring. If a druid or wiz isn't available, you have to wait on the boats, which are dreadfully slow coming and going. I really don't think speeding up the boat travel-times would imbalance anything.<P>Corpse Retrieval / Exp or Ability Debt --<P>Good one here: In AC, I never heard someone complain about dying and subsequent downtime. Sure, the penalties were severe enough, but not such that you had to worry about losing EVERYTHING.  Games, like other programs contain bugs, which in EQ, can cost you hours and hours of boring CR. Bad pathing can increase group play-time exponentially, whether the players involved like it or not.  It would be nice if when a group got wiped out they said to themselves:<P>"Well, we've got this huge exp debt, but we still have our items.  Man, let's go back and kick some arse and pay off that exp debt!"<P>Instead, from my experience, most of the people just want their corpses back so they can camp because it's 2 or 3 in the morning.<P>I'm glad Brad opened this thread back up for discussion.  Kudos to him for doing so.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Still, I'd like to hear some kind of response on these issues.

</FONT><HR>Here's a thought, I'm not sure if this has been brought up yet or not.<P>XP lost is a percentage based on the total xp required for a human (either warrior or of the same class, unsure about that) to lvl. Well, here's athought, ot help reduce down time in xp lost.<P>Right now, we can log in, do a few fights, get killed and completely lost all xp plus some. I have been online for over an hour before, and actually lost xp before I decided to log.<P>Why not have xp based on the average xp GAIN on creatures of ones lvls? Meaning, Have xp lost based on a percentage of xp that mobs of ones lvl would gain.<BR>The main balance I see here is not that of xp loss to xp gain, but time required for it. Both in groups and soloing. If I kill for 30mins, and die, I would like to get the xp lost in 30-45 mins, not 2 hours or even days depending on lvl.<P>There is more of an algorithim to work with here, but hey, that's what us programmers love doing, solving complex algorothims  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>Just a though ..

</FONT><HR>Well I guess I'll throw in my two cents about traveling.  I think a great way to do it would be with a traveling book.  Make them very expensive like 1000pp or something like that, and maybe make them limited in charges.  The travel book would store the last four places that you have been bound while holding the book.  This would require travelling to the place to get bound and preserve the "largeness of the world" etc.  But it drop the mundaneness of having to travel to the same place over and over.  It would also keep the need for spellcasters to provide travel.  Only having four spots would make sure that you couldn't travel just anywhere in the world instantly, and probably would have to get rebound because some of your old spots wouldn't be applicable anymore.<P>I think this might be able to appease everyone.<P>beergeek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'd like to have an official blue name responce to my question...<P>I understand and agree with your terms of downtime as far as groups, solo characters, skills etc. go. Its very needed for play balance. However, there is one thing that kinda irks me... and its how some HIGH level spells fizzle several levels after you get them. In particular I can use 'Ators Shackles' and 'Shield of the Magi' which both fizzle out WAY more than they should. Its not uncommon finding myself (and other wizards) that fizzle out half their mana bar on a SINGLE casting.<P>Is the reason for this because our skill isn't enough to cast these spells? Seems a little ridiculious that even with the spell skills at the max they can be, that these spells fizzle this much even AFTER the skill is maxxed and a (hell)level has been gained since recieving the spell. So, I ask you Verant... <P>What are you penalizing us for now? Simply using our spells?<P>-IcU now.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Brad,<P>I wish you would focus a little more on the acquiring items aspect of the game.  I have been playing Everquest for about a year now, and don't have a lot of time to play (maybe 4-10 hours per week).  I've leveled a character to 30 and another to 12 in the time that I've had to play.  Even after playing all this time, I am still using some of the same equipment that I bought from the vendors when I first started.  It seems to me that in order to begin to 'level up' your equipment you need to either get to level 40 (so you can kill the mobs that give you decent equip), have someone give it to you, OR camp a rare spawn for a quest that will have you waiting at least four hours.  The rare spawns bother me when they are part of a quest that results in a no drop item (I don't have the time or patience to stare at my monitor for 4 hours doing nothing).<P>It seems like the items in the game have a very short range from the worst items to the best items.  I think it would help if there was more room in between, and lower level characters could get somewhat usefull items off of mobs around their level.  I don't think it would be unbalancing, and it would make EQ an overall better game.<P>I know this isn't really totally on topic, but I figure if you're still listening, this may be another good subject to open discussion on.  I also think that most people would agree that 4-24 hours quest spawns are pretty ridiculous and prevent most players (that have to work) from ever being able to do most quests.<P>Thanks for listening.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wow- great thread.  Here's my thought on the whole downtime issue: I think the whole damn game just take too long.  Don't get my wrong, I'm a very happy customer, but I just can't believe how long it has taken me to get my ranger to lvl 49.  I picked this class, to tell you the truth, because I didn't know how long I'd be spending with the game, and the character generator told me that a half-elf ranger was one of the easier classes to play.  Anyone who plays a ranger past lvl 30 will tell you that this is in no way true, if fact, at later levels I think it's probably the hardest class to play.  Between the experience penalty, the near-impossibility of solo play and the difficulty involved in getting pickup groups (whether this prejudice is deserved or not, a majority of high-level PCs seem to loathe grouping with rangers) getting any exp at all is a real trick.<P>But I'm not trying to turn this into a class-balance thread.  I think the game takes too long for everyone.  A dragon raid or big dungeon raid, unless you're with absolute pros, can take six or eight hours, especially if there's a lot of CR involved.  A Planes raid usually means days in a row of twelve-hour gaming.  It's just unhealthy to sit in front of a computer for that long, and this game pretty much requires it at the upper levels.  <P>If it were up to me, exp on all mobs would be doubled, and death penalties would be halved.  I'd like to have a few characters approaching 50th level by now, not just one.  The stakes are just way too high, and the game would be a lot more fun if it didn't require quite so much of one's life to excel at it.<P>But again- don't get me wrong, it's a great game in the first place or I wouldn't have put in all this time anyway, heh.      </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I don't know if you are still reading this thread, Aradune, but I hope so. I wanted to return to an earlier point, one you commented really made you think by Yzona.<BR>To Quote:<BR>Yzona: "Conclusion: You need to encourage risk taking instead of actively discouraging it, and one way to do this is to reduce the penalty for it, which in most cases can be summed up as downtime."<P>Aradune: "Wow, one of best counter arguments posted, giving me much to think about - thanks. As for your conclusion, though, it seems to be contradictory. 'Risk' fundamentally implies a penalty for failure. The greater the risk, the greater the penalty (and hopefully, the reward). IMHO, Reducing penalties doesn't encourage risk taking without also reducing the risk itself."<P>I think you are missing the point. Risky things are risky because they are difficult. The penalty for failure is failure. You didn't get the loot, the xp, finish the quest, whatever. How many of us have played computer games with a very difficult sequence or area, where you had to try it over and over again to succeed? I know I certainly have. The same kind of situation applies in EQ. There are challenges that are exceedingly difficult to overcome, that have enormous reqards to be achieved, that also have a very high chance of failure.<P>Right now, if you fail, WHAM! Feel the pain. You lose a lot more than you potentially would have gained. Yet if Time Invested is the measure of success, you have ALREADY been penalized simply by losing time by having to try again.<P>Every other successful game I have ever played has allowed for the "try, try again" tactic. You keep trying until you get it right. You try oddball tactics, you do weird stuff and fun stuff just to see if it works, because failure just means that tactic didn't work. You can't do that in EQ.<P>You want to know why people are such sticklers for exacting tactics and getting everything right the first time? It's because the penalties for failure preclude experimentation. They can't afford to be wrong. They can't afford to try a novel idea if it will mean getting killed and losing a huge amount of xp, time and possibly even equipment.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>Brad, I think you are fighting a losing battle.  I doubt that you are going to persuade everyone that experiencing a loss is an important part of the game.  Besides dealing with a lot of the I-Want-Everything-Now generation, you are also up against the Never-Lose computer gaming industry.  Just take a look at the the flowchart of an average RPG game.<P>1) Save current state of game<BR>2) Explore<BR>3) Fight<BR>4) If lose fight, go to step 6<BR>5) Go to step 1<BR>6) Reload old game state<BR>7) Go to step 2<P>Now lets consider the Everquest flowchart<P>1)  Explore<BR>2)  Fight<BR>3)  If lose fight, go to step 6<BR>4)  Gain experience<BR>5)  Go to step 1<BR>6)  Lose experience<BR>7)  Deny it was your fault<BR>8)  Look for 'Reload Old Game State' button<BR>9)  Find someone to blame<BR>10) Go to step 1<P>Looking at the flowcharts, it's apparent all Verant has to do is to remove steps, 7, 8, & 9.  If your programmers feel that is too much coding, then my suggestion is that they simply put a fake 'Reload Old Game State' button in the interface.  It'll take awhile for some to figure out that it doesn't do anything but when they do, it will most likely lead to some real interesting posts on this forum.  Some of the topics that come to mind are:<P>1) Helppppppp!!! My Reset Game button isn't working<BR>2) I hate Verant because they have nerfed the Reset Game button<BR>3) Reasons why Reset Game is out of balance<BR>4) Why mages shouldn't have Reset Game<BR>5) My Reset Game hasn't worked since the last patch<BR>6) Barbarians need a stronger Reset Game<BR>7) I never had lag until Reset Game<BR>8) Reset Game takes too long to load<P>I'll probably get flamed for this Brad but please tell your people to keep up the good work.

</FONT><HR>I am not sure if this is the place to post this but...here goes...I have been listening intently to the debate on down time in EQ. I understand the necessity for balance, down time, and experience loss due to death. Corpse recovery is also a necessary evil in my opinion. What I do believe could be altered is the down time caused by the fact that melee classes cannot be bound outside of City zones. This is one area that I believe could be remedied to satisfy many people's downtime complaints while not severely altering play balance. It was a good idea but, in play, it seems to cause more problems and unnecessary downtime than it is worth. This is simply my opinion and not a flame so take it as you will.<BR>The other issue I think could be remedied would be level loss upon death. I can't believe how many times I have lost a bubble of experience after a starting into a level and being knocked down a level, unable to use my new spells, pet, and/or skills. I totally agree with experience loss to death but I think it is reasonable to have it not knock you below your current level.

If you're fighting solo you can get a meager amount of XP from fairly low green mobs... it takes as long or maybe a little longer to level as it would in a group, but you're still don't have any of the annoying downtime either.  You're still welcome to go fight blue monsters and put up with the down-time if you wish.  Of course, there would still need to be a point when the monster is too green to give you any xp and anyone in a group should NOT get ANY xp from a low green... but I would be happy to be able to take my level 16 and go fight low-greens in a non-group area while only having to pause long enough to go to town to resupply.  I would be happy to do this even if it took me 50% longer to level.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here's an idea on travel.  It's probably not possible or feasible to implement this in EQ, but an idea for future games.<P>Change how binding works.  First of all, make it so that all characters have bind-point limitations, such as only in cities.  But instead of spawning at your last bind-point on death, you always spawn in your home city.  (Changing your spawn point might be a higher-level spell, to allow for roleplaying an outcast who can't go home again.)<P>Instead, once you've journeyed to a new place, you get bound there, and that bind allows you to transport there.  Remove teleportation from the game entirely, but make bind-point transport use an item of some kind or require a spell.  Perhaps make it like the Gate spell, in that all pure casters get it at a fairly low level.  After the item is consumed or the spell has been cast, you choose from a list of places you have been bound.<P>Teleportation might remain a viable ability for high-level characters to get to places that are far from cities, but still, it should be like the Velious teleports, where you have to have been there once already.<P>This sort of system would require that every character travel overland to any new destination, but that they would never have to make that journey again if they had a modicum of resources.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OK, this may be really simple, but lets see how everyone takes it. To decrease downtime in EQ, yet keep advancement the same:<P>Double the mana regen rate<BR>Double the health regen rate<BR>Halve the XP loss when you die<BR>Halve the XP GAIN when you kill<BR>Double the boat speeds<BR>Double the MOB spawn rate<BR>Halve the MOB Uber drops<P>Wouldn't this result in more UPTIME fighting and doing things? Is this too simple to really understand? How about adding a few zones that have these qualities?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I Posted this under wishlist as well:<P>I just finished reading portions of the ongoing downtime thread.I think there are some great potential ideas out there that I think Verant is considering judging by their interest in the posts. As I read these topics an idea occured to me that another game utilized. In the Might and Magic series the developers had an interesting twist; that is, they added a game within the game. All of the Inns in the game had a Fantasy style card game available that could be played. The game was actually entertaining and fun as well as a nice break from killing mobs while yet still playing the game. I think adapting an idea like this might have a great potential; however it can be expanded for EQ. Imagine players in a group who can carry a deck of cards and play a card game together by switching to a GUI window game box. In this way, group members can actually still play something fun while waiting to med/heal up. This is not to say the world "stops" around the game, you can still be attacked etc. Additionally, it might make the boat rides more enjoyable if there was something to do amognst the people on the boat. Furthermore the game could be incorporated into quest type fun by asking players to "beat" certain NPC's at the game, or have best of the best card player type events. I think this or a similar idea might have some merit in passing some, but not all of of the downtime. <BR>Granamyre Nevermore of "The Watchmen"<BR>Druid of the 31st Ring<BR>Mithaniel Marr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well I have never posted on here before, but just though I would comment here.  I have played 3 main characters since beta(52 warrior, 51 wiz, 37 sk), and I have one big source of frustration with EQ at higher levels.  The game is designed for groups of 6, yet anything that is really worth getting requires at minimun 2 groups.  All the places where one group could get decent items were pre-expansion.  Now people spend time in planes with 20-30 and only 6 get experience.  Now I understand that it isnt VI "vision" to have a class that is really capable of soloing to level 60, but it should be possible to get a group of 6 and do something besides level.  I can get experience all day with 6 people but I do not really want to JUST level.  I would like to get a small group get some decent experience and maybe have a chance at a good item.  But if I want anything really good I have to take time away from real life and spend untold hours in a plane or uber-dungeon.  That is not fun to me.<BR>I mean even in "The Lord of the Rings" low level Hobbits found great items and did great things.  (Am I the only one that thinks Frodo was only a level 2-3 Hobbit at start hehe) Somehow I don't see any of my characters looting a Ring of Power anything that doesn't involve hours and hours of time and repeated deaths.  Sigh guess I will log onto chat for plan for the 3rd CR in plane of growth, what fun what fun.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
