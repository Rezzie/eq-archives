</FONT><HR>Abashi,<P>Thank you for responding to an issue that has been of GREAT concern to the PvP community, (a very heated topic on Tallon Zek).<P>I vote YES to the ideas that you have suggested.<P>In the mean time, would it be possible to instruct the Tallon Zek GM's to stop warning players who are healing 'Same team' members? Yes, these healers are Out Of Range, but they are Same Team, and GM's have recently begun to issue warnings on this. It's one thing to heal/uber-buff a Level 5, and then send him/her to wreak havoc at the newbie grounds, (just a disruptive act), but helping a fellow teammate who is being attacked in straight PvP should not be a 'warnable/bannable' offense. I sawe above that you agreed, and I would ask that you let the GM's know this, to eliminate the contradiction.<P>Thanx!<P>-Owner SoulStalker<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>PvP should be fixed with as simple of a solution as possible:<P>1) Make it where you can only cast buffs and heals on your own team.<P>2) DECREASE the number of teams from 4 to 2 (if you notice, most people play lightie vs darkie on the PvP servers anyways). This move to 2 teams will increased the "pool" of characters who can heal and buff you, thus minimizing any negative effects of my first suggestion.<P>3) ELIMINATE the options for guilds to house more than one team. This way, you actually create roleplay on PvP servers.  I have no idea why a 4 team server allows a guild to house all 4 teams in it.  Doesn't that defeat the purpose of roleplay?<P>4) Allow all players who don't like these changes to move to Rallos Zek where there are no teams.<P><BR>That's it. Real simple, and brings Roleplay to the PvP servers.<P> Bullmer Moonsong<P> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>WAY TOO COMPLICATED<P>WAY TOO GLITCHIE<P>WAY TOO UNRELIABLE<P>Look people want to play the race they want, they want good vs evil.  They do not want to be forced to only group with "the same team"<P>You yourself say Abashi why shouldn't an elf cleric be able to help a human paladin.  Well I agree.  I also say as so many others have said that why shouldn't that same human paladin get to fight back against a human shadowknight for influence in the city of Freeport.<P>The idea of teams is EXCELLENT.  <P>But the way you chose those teams is utterly rediculous.<P>This will cause way more trouble than its worth.<BR>In addition for the most part the war is effectively over.  People don't fight unless they can win and the level/con and now twink issues make that a done deal.<P>I am not really concerned about making EQ PvP better, its just too far off in core code.<P>But the idea of a some encouraged RP is great.  No more groups of druids and necros or marriages of High elf paladins to Dark Elf Shadow Knights.<P>Just make a GvE server. no cross teaming.<BR>allow transfers. <BR>You will see what we all want, shanks, reapers and other single race folks can go to Rallos and kill both the folks they don't like and those folks friends whom they are pissed they can't attack as well.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>While there is nothing wrong with the idea technicaly, it is flawed philosophicaly.  I don't like crossteamers, but the varing ideas about how to play the game are esential to the game.  I would rather have contempt for a player because i know he helps lighties than because the game only allows me to attack his kind.  It is not verant's job to make people play their charictor in certain ways or with certain values.  <P>People need someone to hate.  It is a releace in the game and if we did not have these crossteamers the harted would fing other (less deserving) targets.  <P>Also why should a high leavel cleric (like me) be kept from patroling Nek healing up those of my race who are defending the land from those who would ruin it.  If chance (sneeking up) mobs are part of the game, why should a pk not have to be conserned about attacking someone who is near a higher level friend.  Limiting higher-lower interaction unessarily limits the community bonds and feeling of interdependance.<P>How would you define race? Some on pvp feel that a human/elf team is a crossteam.  others believe that it is light/dark.  If the community can not decide, why should you?<P>note: in your post you only mention race, not leavel.  but because the examples mention lvl restrictions i assume that was an oversight.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>First off, Great idea, Abashi.<P>Second, I will have to agree that we should have it narrowed down to 2 teams.  All of my characters on Vallon are evils, and I am a little sick of this being 9 races vrs 4.  How would I divide it up?  I have absolutely no idea.  Gnomes are necromancers and seem to be a little "darker" than they are "light", so I would probably just switch the gnomes over to the dark team and have it s 8 vrs 5 situation.  Due to the number of dark elves and Iksar that are in existance, I think you would have nearly a 50-50 server split on dark/light.  This would also narrow the problem of "nuke the cross teaming group and run" issue that has been brought up by several people.<P>and finally: to all of you who think this is against the "roleplaying" aspect of the game, I have this to say to you...  Healers get their powers from their Gods.  Do you honestly think that Innoruuk (the Dark Elf god of Hate) is going to grant the ability for his followers to heal a follower of Karana (your typical Druid god) while they are attacking some of his other followers?  From a roleplaying standpoint you can say that the Gods are sick of seeing their followers slaughtered with the help of those who would betray His trust, and thus he will render all healers unable to heal those who do not follow his word during combat with other followers of Innoruuk.  <P>Yes there are problems in this RP solution.  For example: what if the human that is being immortal healed is also a follower of Innoruuk?  Well, in this case we'll just say that he has fallen out of favor of his God for a small amount of time.<P>Oh, and for the people who say that a DE can just cast an area effect spell on a group of cross teamers and watch them die: this would be a purposful cause of a loss of exp.  This is already forbidden by the PvP rules.  There are already so many ways to cause someone to lose exp that this isn't a real concern for me.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>&lt;&lt; If a player takes damage from another PC, they can only receive beneficial spells from someone in their own team for X-minutes or until they zone<BR>&gt;&gt;<P>A better solution would be to qualify the above change by applying it only in the case where the healer is of the same team as the charcter who did the damage.<P>On Tallon Zek, the sserver environement has evolved into a 2-team war, Good vs Evil. This is very much validated by Verant's design of the EQ background. Quests, geography and faction all combine to create the appearance that the different light races, whatever their differences, are natural allies against the "evil" races.<P>This would be a natural expectation of many newbies, anyway. Like the majority of fantasy novels, Lord of the Rings (which invented orcs &lt;g&gt; ) has the dwarves, elves, humans and halflings as allies.<P>Given the Good vs Evil orientation of Tallon Zek, restricting the ability of light races to heal each other would be pretty unpopular, I think. It is important to also cater to those who want to rebel against the server paradigm by attacking everyone not on their team - but not by allowing the desires of this very small minoriity to ruin the fun of the majority, by destroying their abiltiy to heal each other in combat.<P>Seems like applying the no healing rule ONLY in the case of an invulnerable same-team healer would be a reasonable compromise, rather than nerfing something wanted by the majority in order to please the minority.<P>Skyye</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>&lt;&lt; the "crossteaming" is purely used as an exploit, it serves no other function in the game whatsoever<BR>&gt;&gt;<P>This is an pretty idiotic statement: the so-called "cross-teaming" serves many fuctions.<P>To name a few:<BR>1) Making your side stronger through alliances, ie giving you more numerical strength;<BR>2) Convenience: (a) when the only healer in a zone is from a different light team, you need that healer. <BR> (b) Very often you will not find people of your own team to group with. It's hard enough as it easy, without making it 3 times as difficult.<BR>3) Lights are spread out all over Norrath. It is totally impractical to try to create single team groups, given this fact.<BR>4) Roleplaying and Fun: it is good RP for elves, human or dwarves to group. It also makes the game more practical.<BR>5) Quests and geography: "good" races need to visit each other cities to do quests. They need to hunt in each other's areas in order to level. There are NO high level elf hunting grounds, for instance. Elves must go to Unrest (in dwarf territory, or else to human territory. Given this fact, is is impractical not to group with humans or dwarves.<BR>6) On TZ, the "dark" team is as large as the other 3 teams together. Lights must group together.<P>Skyye</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/002666-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/002666.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/002666-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=002666&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=002666&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
