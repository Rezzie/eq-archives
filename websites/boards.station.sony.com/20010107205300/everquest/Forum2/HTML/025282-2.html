</FONT><HR>To many people seem to think that they HAVE to increase their skill as high as possible.  If you are of limited means, then don't bother increasing your skill past 190 until it makes financial sense to do so.  It may NEVER make financial sense for you to do so.  That doesn't mean the jewelcraft system is broken.  It just means that your method of training and selling back to the vendor is broken.  Maybe the post-190 training was only meant to be profitable by making items and selling them to players instead of selling them to the jewelry shop.  Of course it's going to take much longer that way, but if everyone was a 250 jeweler, the prestige of attaining that status would be lost.<P>Just because something's difficult, that doesn't mean it's broken  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>If you think Jewelry Crafting is expensive.  Try tinkering.  To get beyond 148 skill it requires almost 1k pp PER attempt.  That's not per skill, that's per item made.  Rebreathers cost right at 900 or a bit more.  Tinkering raises just as slow as Jewelry and is quite a bit more costly.  So don't feel too bad, there is one skill out there driving people nuts a little more than JC.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Abashi, are you a jeweler? Have you tried to auction items for sale? I would say Alchemy is more profitable. SoW potions sell for 15pp a pop, triple their cost. I'll be surprised when I sell a piece of jewelery for 50% profit. <P>Making Plat Star Rose rings +4 INT people wont spend more than 150pp a ring and bauk at a 200pp asking price. Last time I checked the price of 1 attempt was about 113pp. Since this item only becomes trivial at a 250 skill the chance of failures is, well, lets say "not profitable".<P>This is to date the first time I have posted asking you "do you really know what you are talking about?"... because Jewelery is only profitable is you make Golden BP chokers with BP's you get as drops, and make nothing else, ever.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I'm amazed to see people calling Abashi a liar over a silly issue like this. It is a fact the jewel craft is profitable.<P>Just look at the jewelers and the levels on your server. I am on Tarew Marr and do quite well with jewelry.<P>Trades aren't for everyone and they are not easy. If you think you are going to spend ten minutes of effort and make 1k plat then you are mistaken. People who enjoy trade skills put the time and effort into it and are rewarded.<P>Just look at the blacksmithing complaints from those that want the quick buck. They are not going to get it. Those that enjoy trades are having fun with smithing.<P>My jewel craft skill is only 196 but I am profitable at it. It has paid for my recent ventures into FS smithing and all the mistakes I made there.<P>I enjoy trades so I put the time into it to make them profitable and fun. Trades shouldn't be easy and shouldn't be for everyone.<P>Verant has done a good job with jewel craft and did a great job with smithing. I'm looking forward to the new jewel craft changes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hey Wayward! Abashi is right and YOU are wrong for slamming him!<P>I have a jewel skill level of 237 and did 11 attempts with jacinth, diamonds, black sapphires for a warrior and only had 3 failures. I've made 8 out of my last 9 plat ruby veils and making tons of pp now. I was maxed at level 200 and then went for 250 and while doing so enchanted my bars so I would actually make money practicing the trade and also selling jewelry while doing so. In a week while practicing the trade for about 4hours a day I made about 20,000pp and bought my twinks some really nice items.<P>I'm on Prexus server so it's no newbie server and have no problem selling jewelry at all. I think the biggest thing with selling jewelry is can people trust ya  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>It did take me up to 300 tries to level sometimes, but most of the time it was 100 tries or less. It's really just time consuming but well worth it in the long run. If you are only going to stick with a level of 190 to 200 then anyone with a level of 220 up is going to kill you with their prices.<P>One thing that I did notice that made me mad was when they raised the max to 250 was that with my 200 skill I was getting alot more failures and it sure cost me alot of pp trying before I figured out what was wrong. I don't think it was right to make me worst at my skill. Anyways if you go above 200 you'll find you have success like you never had before  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Good luck jewelers!

</FONT><HR>You're complaining about 1000 pp?  Let me give you some stats about a real pain in the arse trade skill with an extremely small market!<P>Tinkering.<P>103-138ish Aqualungs (210pp per attempt -- best prices).<P>139-200ish Rebreathers (920pp per attempt -- best prices-- and you have to succeed on a trivial Aqualung first which you'll probably fail 1 in 5 -- my wisdom when tinkering is 138, INT 187ish).<P>Market?  ya, great market.  Verant is creating poor warriors to help our trade skill now, finally, but still its not unusual to spend 10k pp (I've done it) before seeing one skill increase.  AT 157 skill thats not as bad a failure as it once was, but still.<P>Jewelry skill is cheap WITH a market.

</FONT><HR>Yes Abashi is correct.  Read carefully and between the lines here though to what he said.  <P>IF (big if!) you have (many many) wealthy Customers with lots and lots of cash to buy your jewelry you can make post skill level 200.  I would go so far as to say you should not even start on jewelcraft unless YOU are to be the designated Jewelcraft expert in YOUR GUILD and all other guildmates plan to buy your jewelry once you can make it without it costing ridiculous prices due to the cost of failures.<P>I'm at 124 now it took probably 2K-3K plat to get to skill 94 prior to last week and it cost about 2000 plat to go from 94 to 124 last week using up ALL the money I had saved in game through level 33.  This is money I will never likely recover and yes I have advised other people who ask me in game all along that if you are a single casual player without a LARGE number of wealthy friends online you are THROWING TONS OF PLAT away learning jewelcraft.  The risk will never be worth it because you will NEVER see any reward!  Ever.  So read the fine print between Gordons statement and consider that a Huge IF!<P>Point in case I can now make Star Ruby Electrum Rings cost 70 plat or so and failure rate about 1 in 3 fails so I spend 210 plat to make a pair of rings and I have been trying to find a buyer for this pair for a week now with no luck.  Everyone in game is already twinked and or a member of a guild who has their own appointed Jewelcraft expert.  Lesson learned?  Don't spend money on jewelcraft even though its great roleplay if you want to play the role of a dead broke bankrupt jeweler.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>If you are foolish enough to persue JC on an older twink infested server I would have one piece of advice for you.  Wait until your Enchanter reaches at least 39th (or was it 44th) before starting on your skill training.  Why?  Thats when you get your INT buff.  Buy INT gear for yourself early on best you can afford because having INT as high as possible will greatly reduce the cost of skill-ups.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Hmm I can make a ring that gives you 4 INT, how much is that worth?  You know how much mana that gives you?  As much as your level.  That isn't enough mana to actually cast ANY spell that you have at your current circle.<P>The loot in this game, with the exception of weapons, is trash but we have gotten so used to such low standards you fight over 1 more INT on an item and charge thousands of plat for it.<P>Funny how your expectations and standards can be lowered.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>This post is solely concerned with complaints regarding the random number generator. Please keep responses relevant.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Just a thought, but why does everyone assume that the chance for trade success or advancement is RANDOM? Does anyone else see how many variables could go into each sill advancement or success calculation?<BR>Let's take Jewelry as an example.<BR>The collective understanding seems to be that you max your relevant statistic(s), INT or WIS or whatever's popular rumor, and simply combine, and there should be a linear progression in skill with a predictable number of failures in a given situation, modified only by the random number generator.<P>I've compiled a short list of other possible variables that could have been added by those devious programmers. Personally, if I was in on it, I would have implemented as many of these as possible.<P>Metal Enchanted?, Difficulty of Metal, Difficulty of Gem, Class, Race, Religon, Current Lighting, Indoors or Out, City Zone or Dungeon, Time Since Last Attempt, Time Since Last Success, Time Since Last Advancement, Current Health, Current Mana (if applicable), Experience of Jeweler's Kit, Relative Solitude.<P>Some of these are irrelevant perhaps, but look at these situations.<P>--First, an able (INT, etc.) Erudite Enchanter with skill (X)<BR>- full mana/hp<BR>- alone in Erudin Palace in good lighting<BR>- using a Jeweler's kit he's used all his career<BR>- on his third attempt in the last five minutes, having not succeeded or advanced for his last five attempts<BR>- and attempting a gem/stone combination that's one point away from trivial<P>--Second, an equally able (INT, etc.) Barbarian Warrior with same skill<BR>- half beat from the last Ruins train breakup<BR>- in the company of many noisy traders and duelers  in EC tunnel, at night (no concentration)<BR>- using a just bought Jeweler's kit (gave his old favorite to a guildie)<BR>- hasn't worked on skill for a game month (rusty)<BR>- last five attempts were successful with two monster only gems in there (i.e. lucky history)<BR>-attempting the same gem/stone combo (limit of reasonable success)<P>Of these two, who should really expect a better chance at success or advancement?<P>Just an example of how many things could go into a check. It depends on the extent of reality going in to the algorithims. I have renewed faith in the programmers evil genius, as I have discovered a few neat obviously intentional quirks.<P>Just a thought. )</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>DJPhil,<P>Thank you for your comments - that's exactly the point I was trying to get to.<P>For the most part, throughout my jewelry making career, the variable are the same - same jewel kit, same place (Qeynos jewelshop), full HP, full mana, etc.  The only real variables that I can think of are:<P>1. Difference between my skill level and the triv level of the item I'm making (anywhere from a 2 to 9 point difference)<P>2. My intelligence.<P>In the case where I spent the money to go up in skill, my int had significantly increased since I last had the money to put into a JC skill increase session.  I think it had gone from 145 to 180 or so.<P>I had experienced similar differences in skill level versus triv before and had never experienced such a horrendous failure rate or lack of skill raise.  I had also mastered two other skills (smithing at 176 and baking at 142) and had never once seen anything that came close to the losses and lack of skill gain that I suddenly hit at 191 with JC.<P>I was baffled and yes, angry &lt;g&gt;, that I had just spent 1K plat only to watch it go down the tubes for so little gain in skill.  It was far different than any investment versus skill gain/success rate than I had ever experienced before, and I do have considerable experience with trade skills.  I was actually expecting an improvement considering my leap in intelligence since I'd last worked on the skill and was disappointed by the lackluster result.<P>SG</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
