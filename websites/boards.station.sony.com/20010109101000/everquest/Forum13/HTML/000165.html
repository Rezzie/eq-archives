&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>It seems that there are still a number of people who are dissillusioned by useless stats such as dexterity and agility, and to a lesser degree, strength. I am going to attempt to put forth a guide for all of you who still contend that to be an effective warrior, your strength needs to be at least 200 and your agi in the 150s.<P>I will address firstly the role of warriors. Warriors prime role in life is to be a hitpoint sponge. We do this in several ways; long long pulls, holding hard hitting or multiple mobs at bay, or general longetivity. A good warrior trusts his healers and doesn't get nervous when he hits one bubble of health (though, this sort stoicism is not recommended with and healer other than a cleric.)<P>-Dexterity-<BR>   By Verants description, dexterity increases the rate at which weapons proc, how often a warrior crit/crips, and there is a bit of debate on wether it affects dodge. Regardless, it is a stat based upon EQ's random number generator. It is not based in hard math, therefor far too random to be depended on. <P>   Lets take a ykesha, even now one of the most favored weapons (though I never knew why.) Based on an 8 hour camp at Sea Fury Isle in Ocean of Tears, and a perl based battle damage parser written by a friend, a 75 point DD only yielded 3 percent of the total battle damage. Hardly worth the 9 pounds of combined weight of the ykeshas or the wasted stats putting Dex up to 144.<P>   As for crits, crips and dodges, these are all random and can not be relied upon in any certainty. Great, so you get a 170 point crit with your mith two hander, your next 3 crits are all kick based, then your next is a 68 point crit. Big woop.<P>-Agility-<BR>   Agility affects your ability to parry and riposte, as well as your armor class. For every 5 points of agility, you get 1 measely point of AC. You do the math, it is not worth it to dump tons of points into agility when you will yield only 4 or so AC points. 4 ac is not a critical amount of armor.<P>   As for parry and riposte, these again are skills based upon random numbers, ultimatly unreliable, and certainly not important enough to contribute points to. <P>   One caveat, if your agility is -under- 75, you will receive big penalties. There are few races with this problem, so don't worry too much. <P>-Strength-<BR>   Strength is not the defining stat of a warrior, it is not the be all end all deciding factor on how much damage is done, it serves two purposes: bragging rights and the ability to carry more items.<P>   Again, based upon two 8 hour battles with Sea Furies, I tested the effectiveness of strength to damage. Here is how I did it: For the first 8 hour battle, I removed all extra equipment that gave me strength, dropping me to 100 (103 really, but you only get bonuses every 5 points). I fought for 8 hours, logged the results and saved the data.<BR>   The next day, I again fought the Sea Furies for 8 hours, but this time, with the help of a shaman, I kept my strength at about 200. Again, the battle was parsed and data was compared to the fight from the day before.<BR>   What I found is for every 100 points of strength, you do approximatly 3.5% more damage over an 8 hour period using Ykeshas at level 50 with maxed weapon skill. Very unimpressive.<P>-Stamina and AC-<BR>   Stamina and AC are king. With stamina, your warrior will have tons of hitpoints, allowing him to soak up more damage, giving him more time in the ring, and allowing the cleric that extra smidgen of time to throw you a complete heal. AC allows you to absorb more damage more consitantly, again, letting you stay in the fight longer.<P>   At level 50, 5 stamina gives you 24.5 hipoints. while it doesnt sound like a ton, this does add up, and it is not terribly difficult to build up, as there are many stamina based items with great AC. <P>   Also, if your stamina is greater than 100 points, you will not suffer stat penalties when your yellow bar runs down to zero because you have been whacking away for 10 minutes straight. You will however slow down a smidge, but its not horrendous.<P>   Armor Class is complex. It is based upon two numbers, Defense AC and Item AC. In Beta 3, there were two numbers in your stat window for armor class, but Verant later obfuscated this, consolidating the numbers into one. Regardless, there is no reason any warrior should have less than 880 AC at level 50 with non kunark items, and at least 920 with kunark items. <P>   Don't be afraid to sacrifice stength for armor, it will make you a better warrior in the long run. Eventually your high level, high AC armor will have strength bonusses anyhow, so if you are that concerned with the stat, patience will get you what you need while also letting you do what your class does best: tank.<P>In conclusion, AC and stamina are good, strength is a second thought, agility and dexterity aren't worth a damn. If you create your character around this this system, you will have a heartier, more robust, more -effective- warrior.<P>One final note, if you don't use the mouse to move in game, you are at a sore disadvantage.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Sometimes 3 or 4 times in a row.  If I had something with a good dd proc, like a yak, I think I would be getting more than 3%...never had one tho so can't be sure.<P>I do agree with most of what you said, and as long as you can get the four main skills above 100, you are doing good, but if you are creating this guide to be used by newbs creating a warrior, I don't think putting such an emphasis on stamina is a good idea.  If this were to lead the unsuspecting soul to put all his extra creation points in STA instead of STR, he will be sorely dissapointed later in life.  High stamina should be gained the right way, the easy way, the tastey way...be an Ogre. (Shameless plug to propogate my race)  Then, you can still put your extra points in STR, where they belong, where the gods intended them to go...<P>Happy as a pig in sh!t. <BR>=============================<BR>Zukey Twosheds<BR>Mes a Ogre!

This also means when I am encumbered, something like 400/176, my agility is STILL higher than my base of 80.

</FONT><HR>Very good guide, i guess the ogre isnt to knowledgble at all, NOT everyone wants to play OGRE warriors, this is a guide for people who want to make the most out of there warrior not make an unlitame class.<P>STR - usefull for low lvs, because bronze encumbers you, once you get better than bronze str isnt a big issue. If you want to dual wield, have a low str, if you want to use 2 handed have a higher STR<P>STA - Best to have a high sta, it give you hp, lets you swing wepons longer (due to wepon weight) lets you swim for longer, jump more ectm run for longer.<P>AGI - Get hit less, minor ac increase, the less you get hit the less damage you take, sometimes its better to avoide one hit that take partial damage on multiple hits, thats why ogres are easy to proc against in a dual, yet a halfing may avoid most of the procs. (more hits more chance to proc)<P>DEX - Effects wepon to hit ratio, better dex, hit more often and for more, this is minor though, the ATK value does most of the work, Wepon PROC works off dex, but independat the damage of the hit.<P>INT - Learn wepon skills faster, dark elf max faster than ogres, try it out.<P>The optimal warrior for general dual wield and double attack should have enough STR to hold bronze armour or 2/3 bronze armour, this is around 85 str min prefered.<BR>Stamina should be high without lowering other stats, get str to 85 min and other stats like dex and agi to a good lv and then dump more points into STA. DEX a lot of items that raise this, keep this your lowest stat, its the least usefull to you but dont overlook it, ADI more important that dex to a warrior, lets you take less hits bacically, anything over 75 is good get to around 80 if you can, items will raise this naturally without you aiming to even raise it.<P>That is what i consider a efficent warrior to be, i had a SK for who can tak 40 str more over  his base, i can get around 55 str over my base easily and after doing a test there wasnt a great deal of damage done, i seemed to hit for higher values more often, ie not getting as many week blows but appart from that i wasnt doing any more than maby 1 or 2 swimgs more, i could of taken those items off and had AC wich would of made me last longer... warriors are never going to out damage pets at lower lvs, why bother? get AC and HP then you can outtank them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Belce when you learn something please post back.<P>There is a reason EVERY high lv warrior has stated INT works wepon skils faster.. its true.<P>100 int will build faster wepon skills than 200 str, although DEX is a different thing, it makes the chance to hit higher, therefor granting you less miss, less miss means you are hitting more, therefor building skill faster.. DEX has nothing to do with actually lernaing a skill, it just makes your chances greater and a little faster.<P>Get a halfing warrior and compare to dark elf, get a ogre and compare to dark elf, the dark elf will max ALL his skill by the time you are working on your second one.<P>I am fed up of people that READ and post instead of acctually test it out, the people who have posted to let you know what is what have tested this, its a dead easy tests and i suggest you do it, right now i feel sorry that you are sticking to this fact that is false, as you are obviously not quick enough to pick this up. Its been know not long after release and is so easy to test, why people havent done it i dont know?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have a couple things to say here.  FirstI think just about everything in the guide is great advice.  The one thing I disagree with is that because something has a random chance you disregard it.  <P>"As for parry and riposte, these again are skills based upon random numbers, ultimatly unreliable, and certainly not important enough to contribute points to."<P>True AC is almost aleways better for a warrior than AGI but the random chances do help out.  I don't want to explain statistics right now on this board but ultamatly it does help out some.  I personaly consider AGI the best stat after AC.<P>And I don't know if anyone can clarify this but the last guy said that DEX helps you hit things.  I believe that is untrue.  Does anyone have a reference from Verant or a reliable test about that?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Thats a nerf needing item if ive ever seen one, 15 to 20 agi and all you gotta do is proc the thing and put it away for the 30 mins it takes to wear off. Normally while in group i pass it around between melees till it procs on all of us and at 9 36 1hs its not that bad while waiting to proc, after all your job as a war is to take hits anyway right? Use it with a gnoll lariat for stuns and youll take less damage while waiting for the Agi, and the 3ac isnt too shabby on that 5pp gnoll whip.<P>Also Forrest loops! Ditch the stupid 4 str earrings for 2ac 3dex 3agi 3wis... if you are high enough level to need em you probably can tag team the giants with a single partner or any high 30s full group can rape the place so quickly you will get earrings for all your tanks and healers to (what a waste of stats to toss to a healer that can already get 3 wis ears, your tanks need the other stats more!)

</FONT><HR>Actually Intelligence has zip, nadda, nothing to do with learning any of our combat skills, nor does wisedom.  Warrior combat skills are learned based on dex, agl, and str, attributes that actually count for those skills, just like int and wis has a role to play with caster skills.<P>Gordon posted several months ago what attributes contributed to game skill advancement, intelligence wisedom was not part of the equation.  Dark elves do not learn faster than ogres because of intelligence when it comes to 2hs or taunt.  They can be better smiths or tailors if that interests them.<P>I have played several different races of warrior and it is always the same, slow initial, after you get to about 50 very rapid, slow again after 180 skill.  Looking at the game model that is used here this makes sense.   <P>Really as a warrior your int and wis could be zero and you would learn combat skills just as fast someone with equal str, dex and agl.  Next time you level ask for a dex buff to help you out. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>For Car.. whatever his name is, benefit<P>Strength: Strength determines how much you can carry.  It influences maximum and average damage and how quickly you learn many offensive skills.  For a Warrior, strength is the most fundamental statistic.  It increases the consistency of damage output, as well as helping the warrior to improve their skills.  You should assign the majority of your bonus statistics here.<P>Agility: Agility affects how quickly you can learn some defensive skills, how difficult it is to hit you as well as how much damage you take when you are hit.  The true effect of Agility is often debated.  Whilst adding points to your Agility will increase your overall AC, it will not be a great deal unless you assigned the majority of your bonus points to this statistic.  This would mean a lower overall damage output since you have reduced your base strength, but would mean you had a chance of lasting slightly longer in combat.  It is certainly true that a high AC is something to be aimed for, but we recommend that the extra Agility is not worth the loss in Strength.  Agility is still a statistic very worthy of considering as for allocating your remaining bonus points.<P>Dexterity: Dexterity affects how quickly you learn weapon skills, and how often weapons will do their special attack.  This is another very important stat for Warriors.  Most warrior classes already have an innately high dexterity.  Most high level weapons have special abilities which help to deal more damage during combat.  Dexterity also affects how often Warriors deliver critical or crippling blows. As a result of this a high dex is something which is always handy.  There are also a number of items and buffs in the game which help to increase your overall dexterity.  Putting bonus points into dexterity is a very viable choice.   <P>Wisdom: Wisdom affects the amount of mana the priest classes have, also rangers and paladins.   Since most warrior races have higher Wisdom than Intelligence they should look to buff this statistic when doing trade skills.  But it is not a statistic to invest your bonus points in..<P>Intelligence: Intelligence directly affects how quickly you can learn most skills.  It affects the amount of mana for bards and all pure casters, as well as shadow knights.  Like wisdom, intelligence is only useful for skill raising for warriors.  Dark Elves, Gnomes and Half Elves should consider buffing this stat if they are doing trade skills.  It is not a statistic to increase with your bonus points however.<P>This was taken from everquest casters realm web page.  It mirrors my many warriors experience in game and what was stated by Gordon regarding warrior skills.  It should be noted that when wis and int are indicated as helpful for raising skills here they do not refer to any combat skill.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum13&number=13&thisthread=000165&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum13&number=13&thisthread=000165&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
