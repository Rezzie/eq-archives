</FONT><HR>jeesh people, everyone is so quick to say nerf PoG, nerf classes, nerf items, ***?  Gets old after a while.  How about adding fun instead of taking it away?<P>Of course PoG will be easy if you bring 40+ people.  Its also boring as hell like that.<P>Its actually a really fun zone when you bring about 3 groups and move around.<P>Dont lose focus on the real issue here.  That is the rarity and difficulty of the quest armor.<P>ToV is really way out of line.<P>Myself and friends chose to side with giants.  We've gotten a few Kael quest armor parts done.  We dont really work on them anymore due to ToV being so whacked.<P>You need about 4 groups or so and the downtime is unreal.  Its not really fun at all.<P>We do have fun hitting PoG with a few groups and doing river runs.<P>Maybe making Skyshrine and Kael quest armor a bit better regarding risk vs. reward would be more productive than nerfing the hell out of PoG.<P>I'd love to work for more Kael armor, unfortunately as it is it's quite an undertaking.<P>Two suggestions people bring up that might work:<P>a) Modify the drops and encounter difficulty in Temple of Veeshan to allow quest armors to be more achievable.<P>b)  Increase the power of the Skyshrine and Kael armors to be in line with the extreme difficulty in obtaining them.<P>Personally I'm rooting for A.  I'd like more options when I play EQ, more options for 3 or so groups, not 5+.<P>Anyway, people need to lose the 'nerf PoG' attitude.  Thats pretty lame.  No need to ruin a fun zone to make it in line with totally screwed up armor like Kael and Skyshrine.<P>Other ideas:<P>1)  Make ranger, druid, and paladin armor drop in PoG<P>2)  Make Kael quest armor parts drop rarely off of West Waste Dragons.<P>3)  Make Protectors of Growth spawn relative to the quantity of people in the zone.  ie: 45 people "farming" PoG = 10 Protectors instead of 2.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

If the PoG wiz robe has a 28 second Enticement of flame, the Quest robe should have a 10-15 second lure (each of the 3 quests could give a different one, fire, frost, and lightning)<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I hate to say that but a nerf of PoG is needed, wether it be a nerf of the drop rate, a nerf of the items or a dramatic increase of the difficulty or a combination of those. <P>Right now this zone contains some of the best items in the game and the difficulty is zero. What is left to do after you got 90% of your wishlist with no challenge? This zone is a danger to the viability of the game. If you can't see how that threathen the game economy then I don't know what else can be said.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ya, go to PoG, too bad its camped 24/7. <P>Ive never fought the CoV faction mobs in ToV, so I have no idea how hard they are.  But the wandering Wyrms and what not in the Testing area are about 2x as hard as Trakanon each, and on 90min spawns, so i KNOW that any armor gotten from them should be tons better than PoG.  Maybe Kael and SS should be same.  Thurg is a bit easier, but should still yield armor better than PoG.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

How anyone in game can stand to be in your presence is a marvel worthy of Ripley. This discussion isn't about Sleeper's, go do your whining about that in one of the threads you created about the topic.<P>It's sad that people are so busy hating FoH that they don't see a very relevent problem here.<P>The Velious quest armors are messed up.

</FONT><HR>Ummm, Furor, here's a different perspective.<P>Thurg armour pieces drop in Kael. Kael courtyard/arena is easily doable by one group of mid 50's for fun and exp. ALL Gems (let me repeat that - ALL GEMS) drop in the spider area of Velks Lab (down near the Ice Djinni). Many of the lesser gems drop in Icewell Keep (not all Armour Pieces will be TUNICS). The Spiders/IK are easily doable by one group of mid 50's for fun and exp. The Thurg armour is mostly very very nice armour considering that the pieces are available so easily.<P>The SS and Kael pieces are for those people that absolutely must have the best piece and have huge quantities of time to sink into such a venture and belong to an Uber Guild. People like you Furor. People that play in Sleepers and will have access to the Quest pieces that drop there.<P>The Quests are NOT mandatory, you are NOT obligated to do them. Don't like em? Well hey, don't do em.<P>The PoG drops do not come at no cost, and are simply not available to some classes (as you pointed out). For those without FoH level resources, or unwilling to sacrifice the time and effort to do the Thurg Quests, then basically they can choose to Lewt Up in PoG at the cost of their Faydark Factions. What's wrong with that? It's a choice, make yours and live with it.<P>All seems reasonably well balanced to me.<P>I agree about the Quest piece drop rates, Verant might consider upping the drop rates slightly on Armour pieces and Gems. Slightly. Maybe make them something in the order of 10% more common.<P>All that will happen from your posts here is that PoG drops get nerfed again, and removes some of the fun from the game for others. Is that your intention?<P>Strom<BR>60 Shaman of Terris-Thule<BR>Equites Nobilis</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Quests aren't obligatory, but its foolish to think they shouldn't reward you in proportion to their difficulty and danger.<P>If you can go get better stuff by killing some creatures in half the time, effort, and danger of a quest, and the quest gives you inferior equipment, that is a problem, clearly.<P>Quests by their nature are meant to be challenging, but their reward MUST be commensurate with the difficulty of the quest.  Otherwise people will just shrug and not do the quest at all.<P>And that's what this is all about isn't it?<P>That and wondering about the inequity in drops and factions... be friends with a dragon, get poorer gear from their enemies... where's the benefit in that?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>As a ranger of Karana I feel very screwed when it comes to armor in Velious. No armor in PoG. I sat around for a week while my guild cleaned up in this zone. I am a Karana worshipper so I can't even wear the nice PoG quest ranger helm. PoG is a 100% useless zone to me and many other rangers, druids and paladins.<P>My guild has sided with giants so I really can't do the Thurgadin armor quests. Besides, the armor the quests give sucks. The breastplate would be an upgrade to Tolan's but guess what, It has yet to be finished by anyone. <P>The Queen's carapace used to be a tunic a ranger could look forward to, seeing as how it is a downgrade for plate classes, but now it has been nerfed so that rangers can't use it.<P>The only real option for me is to farm Western Wastes dragons and pray for matchless armor to drop. Well, we've killed lots and lots of those dragons and there is a whole ONE piece of matchless armor on Solusek Ro. Only a handful of peerless pieces too. The good armor in this zone is far too rare. <P>Some changes really need to be made in Velious. Armor drops need to be added for rangers, druids and paladins, armor quests need to be made easier, or the rewards need an upgrade, and good armor in Western Wastes needs to be easier to get. Something like Klandicar should drop a random piece of perrless/matchless every time, instead of the trash armor he usually drops. Please do something soon because I'm tired of feeling screwed.<P>Brahmabull<BR>Ranger<BR>Sol Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

What they, and myself and 99.99% of high end gamers want, is better amrmor for the quests.  There is no point in doing the really hard quests now.  There should be.  It should be better than PoG.  Kael and SS should be TONS better than PoG.

</FONT><HR>Hmm.  So let me get this straight.  SoV quest armor is (generally) better than PoG armor, even if only a little in some cases.  And it's harder to get.  Better, and harder to get.  Yeah, that sure seems wrong to me.<P>Answer this:  If you had a 20/26 sword for your warrior, and there was a 20/25 sword out there somewhere, but it was an INSANE pain in the ass to get, would you go after it anyway?  I guess that all depends on whether you think it's worth it or not, but it's YOUR CHOICE.<P>The fact that quest armor generally tends to suck compared to the amount of work involved is NOT a new concept in EQ.  I really don't see Verant changing this -- it's designed this way for one reason:  to keep you playing longer.  It's a thorn in your side that you still don't have the "best" stuff in the game, so maybe you'll keep paying each month while you work toward getting it.  Or maybe you'll just say screw it and quit.  Compare that against just giving you all the best stuff, and not even having that "maybe you'll keep playing" in the equation.  Verant may be clueless in a lot of ways, but they definitely know the psychology behind keeping that $10 a month coming in.<P>Anyway, as for the subtle hinting of nerfing PoG in some way... seriously, suck it up.  When I read your post, I don't see you trying to champion the cause of greater good for all players.  I see you trying to ensure you maintain your elite status, now that smaller guilds have a decent shot at good gear.  Really, who cares?  Even with PoG gear, most of the "gimpy" guilds are still going to be gimpy.  It's not like they are going to walk into VP, and all the dragons will go, "oh, I see you have PoG armor.  Well, geeze, in that case I'll just roll over on my back and die now."<P>Besides, EQ is so FUBAR at this point from all the "balancing" and mudflation, who really gives a crap?  I for one am happy that all us lamers who never had the firepower to gank VS/Trak each week to get our kunark armor finally have a realistic shot at some nice stuff.<P>Everyone knows EQ's days are coming to a close in the not-so-distant future.  Be happy for us.  We collectively have a LOT more /played days than all the uberguilds, and we payed the same $10 a month you all did.  I think we deserve to go out with a bang too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>FACT: Anyone who wants PoG to remain un-nerfed is someone who's equipped in a piece or more of PoG armor, can't get anything better, and doesn't want its stats to go down.<P>It's folks like you who call us selfish for wanting to see PoG armor brought in line with its difficulty level (i.e., severely downgraded). Yet it's folks like you who are acting out of your own self-interest. Not us. No one in FoH has more than a couple PoG pieces at best. No one in FoH has farmed or wants to farm PoG extensively; hell, we stay as far away from that boring, gimp-infested farm festival as possible. And no one in FoH disagrees that PoG is perhaps the worst mistake of a zone Verant has made in a LONG time.<P>Yes, it's quite fun seeing complete morons, with no friggin' clue how to do anything worthwhile in the game, running around with armor better than the stuff found on the genuinely challenging mobs. That's "fun" in a nutshell for you.<P>Get a clue, people. PoG needs to be nerfed, and it needs to be nerfed BIG TIME.<P>Yes, quest armor pieces should be MUCH better than PoG armor. They are, after all, a couple million times harder to come by.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Nerfing = Bad.<P>I agree, PoG is too easy, and sure, there's Faydwer faction, but by the time most get to that level, they probably don't visit faydwer anyway. Not like any High Elf Clerics can't just participate in a quick Lucan raid to get the faction to train and buy spells with the Marr clerics. Not like any Wood Elf/Half Elf Bards haven't already bought every bard spell the wood elf guild sells and have more than enough faction to train in FP or Qeynos, etc, etc.<P>However, It's been in the game too long. To nerf it now would be every bit as dumb as the Sleeper's Tomb Nerf. The time for nerfs is in beta testing. <P>Now, reducing the difficulty/raising the reward of the Thurg/Kael/SS Quests? Oh yeah, That would definitely be something to do.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here's an example of the problem on a front that has NOTHING to do with the Plane of Growth.<P>Stein of Mogguk: +10 INT, 1 charges light heal, +5 DEX, +10 HP, +25 save disease.  Fairly easy quest that requires picking up a variety of items and a friendly enchanter.  Sells for a couple hundred plat.<P>Phenocryst's Focus: 5 AC, +3 DEX, +10 INT, +40 mana, +3 all saves.  Requires a long quest all around Velious going to zones that are 30+ and killing multiple creatures higher than level 40.<P>Now, the focus is nicer, but its not THAT much nicer, and it goes in the same slot.  Put this in range and you got something but I'm sorry, this is not risk vs reward.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>They won't fix this. They goofed up BADLY, just like they did in Kunark, but have too much pride to admit it, and fixing it would admit the mistake. They will remain silent as though no problem is exists. <P>This should be easy, as a few gimps incapable of EARNING good items will rush to the defense of easy-to-get loot. These people must pickett outside of congress to have money grow on trees.<P>The only thing that Verant isn't thinking about is the fact that a lot of us high level gamers are not going to buy EQ2 due to Verant's constant demonstration that they are incapable of balancing Risk and Reward. They can't do it, they are either not intelligent enough and not in touch enough with their own game.

</FONT><HR>Phelan,<P>I was hoping I wouldn't have to do a step-by-step breakdown of your rather beligerent and wholy incorrect argument, but what must be done must be done...<P>"Now how did I put words in your mouth? Where did I misinterpret you?"<P>You asserted that I am sporting an elitist attitude toward acquiring items in the game. Rather, I am simply putting forth the idea that someone who kills difficult mobs should be rewarded moreso than someone who lacks the ability to kill said mobs and instead opts to farm a ridiculously easy zone. Furthermore, I feel that the rewards from said easy zone should not be superior to those from the difficult mobs elsewhere, which unfortunately is currently the case.<P>"Do you see the selfishness and hypocricy in your own statement? [We don't have any of that stuff (it's too crowded with those we wouldn't sully our elitist shoes with) so it ought to be nerfed.]"<P>There is no selfishness or hyprocrisy in anything I've said. Rather, it's your misinterpretation of what I've said that is most irritating. Our having little PoG armor and our interest in seeing PoG nerfed are entirely incidental. The only reason I mentioned that we avoid PoG is to emphasize the fact that we are not simply saying "Oh, we got our stuff, now let's ruin it for everyone else" -- an assumption that a troll similar to yourself made earlier on this thread. I was countering someone else's argument; I was certainly not saying or implying that I want to see PoG nerfed out of jealousy.<P>"Interesting delusion you're under that EVERYONE agrees with you that POG ought to be nerfed. I just read the whole thread. There were 4 people that said PoG ought to be nerfed. A bunch said the other quests ought to be unnerfed. HUGE difference between those two propositions."<P>Earth to idiot: I was saying that EVERYONE agrees that PoG loot is out of whack. I was not saying that everyone agrees it should be nerfed. In my opinion, however, it should.<P>"And guess what? Just to cut-off your next brilliant rejoinder , as a Karana worshipping druid, I can't get anything from there."<P>I'm glad you anticipated and boldly countered something I was not even contemplating saying. I hope you feel special. Would you like a cookie?<P>"Conclusion: Reducing the rarity on the other SOV armours does not require nerfing of PoG. I'll never see any of this stuff as a dedicated casual player. Millie is demonstrating the exact attitude that so many despise FoH for having."<P>My entire point is that a casual gamer should not see the same or superior rewards to that which a powergamer should see. Let's be honest here. If you worked 50 hours a week, would you expect to be paid more than someone at the same job who worked only 20? No, you would expect to be paid more. The same goes for my argument. Someone who plays more and accomplishes more in-game should expect to see far superior rewards to someone who plays casually. I have nothing against the "dedicated casual gamer;" however, I do feel that the casual gamer's rewards should be just that -- casual. The time and effort you invest in anything in life should be commensurate with what you receive from that undertaking.<P>Reducing the rarity on quest armor is a good first step. However, the quest armor should be much more noticeably superior to PoG armor than it currently is. There are two ways of accomplishing this goal: nerfing PoG armor or upgrading quest armor. Upgrading quest armor would force Verant to have to re-work every mob in Velious to accomodate the new rise in player-character power. Nerfing PoG armor, an armor set whose power was a mistake to begin with, would not. Given these two choices, YOU decide which is best for game balance.<P>The next time you have some brilliant diatribe to launch against sentiments I've never conveyed, please keep the urge to yourself. Rest assured I won't be listening, or responding.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The shame here is that even after an incredibly intelligent and well put post like Kefka's above, Verant won't be fixing this. They won't even respond to this thread.<P>Each high level player has his/her threshhold for Verant's incompetence. I took a several month break after the blunder that was Epic Weapons, I think I just needed PoG to break the camel's back. Perhaps Verant's ineptness is a blessing in disguise so that the powergamers can finally get full-time social lives.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>And before any of you free-loot-loving, I've-been-level-52-since-July GIMPS bother to recite your beloved VAK slogan "GQLLFM," this imbalance and Risk and Reward is going to make the game worse for you in the long run as well. Deep down, you WANT something to shoot for that you cannot obtain. I'm sure 90% of the infidels screaming "SAVE POG!" aren't intelligent enough to comprehend most of the ideas presented by those requesting that PoG loot be nerfed, so I'd advise just keeping your little mouths shut - it'll be for your own good.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
