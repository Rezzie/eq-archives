</FONT><HR> I have been hearing this recently, that verant planes to up the level of the mobs in hate and fear.  I BEG of you, please do not do this. I am not a hardcore gamer, but I'm not exactly casual.  I have 2 characters in the high 20s, and a lv 45 cleric.  I have been looking forward to going to the planes for about a year now (since they came out?), and if they make all the mobs harder, i will never make it.  I dont think any of my characters will ever make it past about 53, since even in the pre 50 hell levels I am much more inclined to play my alts (hence 2 almost 30).  If they buff them up, it will prolly be about a 54 min before they even think of bringing you.  Also, my entire guild is FINALLY getting into the upper 40 range, so i was really looking forward to a guild only fear or hate raid.   This will not happen if they buff the planes.<BR>Please verant, I like my cleric.  I like siting/healing/stuning/root parking.  I am dealing with the new hate with heals.  I JUST WANT TO GO TO THE PLANES.<BR>/plead Verant<P>P.S  If its a problem with high level guilds farming them for epic quests, put the items on triggered mobs!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Brad, has anyone given thought to the fact that with tougher gods and new loot  the ubers will clear the planes and let class armor rot because they already have said loot... just so they can get to Cazic and Inny????  <P>This is just stupid.  The uber guilds and level 60's will be right back in Hate and Fear looking for the new Phat Lewt.. .in getting to that loot they'll clear the planes of "trash" and let all that gear just rot.  They can't ask people to come loot it because that will lag the zone so bad they'll go LD.   <P>Once again.. you leap before you look.  If you are going to do this.. move the gods to a spot in the zones where all the level 60's and uber guilds can get to them without killing off the other mobs in the zone.  If you leave it like this.. you just screwed all the 46 to 54 players who have been looking forward to shots at their planar gear for a long time.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well... this makes only sense to me when you also add the following changes:<P>- random plane item drops in both planes<BR>- revamp plane items and make them useful.<P>There are some classes with very good drop rates and good items and others with very low drop rates (just a few mobs in plane) and also quite a lot of almost useless planar armour. Take a look at the items please. Does it make sense that for example just Druid legs, tunic and bracers are useful? And other classes have similar problems,too. <P>When you compare Velious loot to planar loot you should see a (probably) too wide gap on many items. When you tune up the planes in general (heard also normal mobs levels are increased) it is the chance to make some changes that fix the problems. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>If you are going to do this I beg you to change the Epic. I for example am only a 51st level enchanter that has been playing since release and you guessed it I am a casual gamer. Currently I have to kill Innoruk and then another Mob spawns after hes dead that I have to kill to then get an item towards my Epic. If you buff the Gods and surounding area you have killed all chances of me ever completing this quest. I am not saying make it easier but I think VI needs to take a step back and realize that in fairness it should take into consideration all its customers PL or Casual. I feel that everyone should get a chance, to have a fair shot. I am a casual gamer in a casual gamers guild and a raid of that magnitude is out of our reach. So it not only effects me it effects my entire Clan. Please reconsider the effects of your actions and who you may be effecting and leaving out. There has been a great deal of attention given to your PL class of customer but dont make the mistake of thinking that your casual player is not a large portion of your customer base and they as well deserve equal and fair consideration. <P>Remember, the Larger portion of your custoers are working class folk with families that cant play 10+ hours a day. Please do not forget to think about us and take away more than you already have. <P>Shimmer K'Sheyna<BR>51st level Enchantress of Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There's something that I've wondered. Many people get annoyed at being, effectively, the second round of testing while paying $10 per month. (I can understand that, I've been annoyed at it too.) So I'm curious, purely as an academic question:<BR>Would you be willing to pay $15 a month instead if they used the extra money to hire about 3000 people to live on the Test server, 8 hours per day, 5 days a week? Put about 2000 on one shift, for peak simulation, 1000 on the next, for off-peak. It still won't match the full population as far as finding loopholes, but it may help catch functionality problems.<P>So, would you?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The reason there are so many complaints is because there are more people 55 and under than there are 55 plus, but there are still a lot of 55 plus and they need more stuff to do.  Face it, the high end game is what Everquest is all about.  If they can please those people and still keep a great deal of the playerbase sending in their 10 bucks a month then they'll damn sure do it.  The best you can do is: a.) get over it, or b.) level up your character.  Those complaining about the drops, I knew the god loot was being moved to the underlings and I don't even keep up with game news that much.  And no, I'm not 55 plus.  My highest lvl character is lvl 31.

</FONT><HR>DO NOT DO THIS!<P>There are still a number of people who have not bought (and will not buy) RoK or SoV.  That means they CANNOT go above level 50.  Killing a god is one of the most fun things in the high level game.  By doing this you will be removing the opportunity of them ever doing that.<P>Take Plane of Air for example.  Since Kunark has been out the level requirement (from raid leaders on Tunare) has been increased from 47 to 55!  Why?  Because you cannot take down the larger boss mobs without people of that caliber.  If you buff the gods in the old planes to 60+, you will be making it almost impossible for people under level 55 to attend.  That will then result in uber guilds farming the buffed gods for their drops.  And I know people from those guilds on Tunare who have already said that is EXACTLY what they'll do! :</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Xerzes I completely disagree with you.  The high end game is obviously NOT what EQ is all about.  You said yourself that there are more people below 55 than above (actually a LOT more).<P>Pleasing the top 5% of the playerbase really should not be much of a concern for Verant, except for one aspect: these uberguilds help playtest stuff before other people get to it.<P>However, keep in mind that these are the people who spend the most time online, eating up far more bandwidth for their $10/mo than the casual gamer.  Bandwidth is the biggest cost outlay Verant has at this point, so obviously they want to focus on keeping CASUAL gamers who don't suck down as many bytes per month.<P>Personally, I think changing the gods is a bad idea.  It unbalances the game for people who aren't super high level or in uberguilds.  It cuts off a portion of the game and reserves it for this upper tier once again.<P>Worse yet, it creates more of a division between casual gamers and the super high levels, since people in this upper tier were able to kill these gods at earlier levels.  But now the casual gamers, for the most part, won't be able to achieve that milestone anymore.  In some ways it is like stopping a powerful item from dropping in the game without deleting existing ones.  Yeah you remember the manastone, right?<P>Look what happened - you couldn't get on a major raid without one until Verant went back and corrected their error.  This is the same type of thing, except with creatures instead of items.<P>Just my $.02<P>- S</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

How can someone who is limited to Lvl 50 enjoy a plane where the head cheese there is so far out of the characters' league?  Think of this like the Vox/Nagafen thing.

Why would you think they wouldn't want a God challenge?<P>Clearly the items from the gods aren't thay "uber" compared to the Kunark/Velious items, *BUT THAT IS OK*.  People &lt;50 need some grand encounters too.  Removing this makes the game more and more a race to 55+ so you can kill Trak and VS and those types of mobs.

I have a 52 Ranger on Bristlebane, and every Fear crack I've been on since the pathing and aggro changes a few months back has been, well, Hell on Norrath.  If you buff the Gods, then you'll have to buff the rest of the zones MOBs.  This will only make getting into the Plane harder than it already is.  I enjoy planar raids, but if you guys at Verant make them tougher than they are, I may just give up on getting my planar armor.  I've already given up on my epic quest as I'm not in an uberguild, and will most likely never see VS or Inny as it is.  By buffing the Gods, you only make that situation worse.  I do hope you rethink this more than once, and consider where those of us that don't have the huge guilds or uber-high level characters will be left once these changes are implemented.

</FONT><HR>Just a quick note in response to <P>"As for you being able to take your items with you, not a chance.<P>When you are playing in a testing environment like the test server you are able to obtain many items from "bugs" and/or "tuning issues" as encounters are brought into alignment with the intended design. <P>To allow those items to be kept on a "live" server would be unfair to the players who had to achieve them via the normal route.<P>Essentially, it's like cheating."<P>This is a common misconception of Test Server.  In actuality people play there exactly the same as in "live" servers.  "Bugs" and "tuning issues" are not any more of a factor on test server than they are on live servers.  Unfortunately, most bugs of this nature make it to live servers (think Kunark and Vellious item availability and how it changes soon after release to live servers).  If a bug happens that people get items they shouldn't, there is a roll back or item wipe.  If the same thing happens on a live server (and it has) they do nothing.  Playing on test server is much more of a challenge than playing on a live server, you cannot just go buy anything you want as there are no farmers.  Some rare spawns happen more often on test, some are almost never seen (depends upon if they pop on server up or after a week or so... test is rarely up for a week at a time).  Test players deserve respect for playing on the hardest server of them all, not dismissal for being on a "cheat" server.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Interesting thoughts all of you.<P>I do find it funny, that the casual gamer wants access to all areas of the games, that nothing should be touched, and all should be within their reach for the 3 hours a week they can spend playing.<P>Sorry, I disagree.<P>If you want the "uber" opportunites, become "uber" and earn the right.  I go nuts when I hear people complain about the "uber" guilds running everything.  If you can't beat them, join them.  If you can't or won't join them, as the case may be, stop whining about it.<P>What you fail to understand is, YOU DON'T NEED AN UBER GUILD TO GO TO THE PLANES.  In all honesty, you don't even need a group.  Find a high enough wizard, get a few of your friends together, and go.  You run the risk of another guild or group being there before you anyway.  All you people complaining about how you'll never get invited to a plane raid...  start your own and invite who you wish.
