</FONT><HR>One of the rangers in my guild was deleting an item but something happened and it deleted the bag that was open WAS HIS BAG OF EPIC QUEST ITEMS THAT WAS 2 EASY STEPS FOR BEING DONE!!!!  This of course wasn't his intention so he decided to petition for reimbursal because a this bug delete his bag with his items that he worked hard to get.  It took the GM almost a week to get online to handle the case but when she did she goes and a quote <P>"You had enough time to realize what happend" "I can not help you, it is our policy not to restore destroyed items, and i will not break that policy"  <P>This problem has happened before to another player before they hired this "lady" to be our Lead GM and they took care of it with little questions asked.  He is giving up on trying for his items so he spent 7 hours reforaging the goods for to mix in the bowl, I don't believe our lead GM has spent more than 7 hours logged in our server during game time.  Sorry but your Senior Guides who are 100 times better than you can't make up for you (can't remember the lead gm's name at the moment I'm so angry).  Hope the GM's boss reads this or one of our PR men or women read it and handle the situation before he decides to quit.<P>Talamyen, Lvl 53 Ranger<BR>Ronalron, Lvl 44 Magician<BR>Legendary<BR>The Tribunal Hell Server<BR>Member since Sept '99</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Yeah, join the club.  And VI probably won't do anything about it.  I had a situation in where a gm was making up information just so that they didn't have to help my partner and I.  I do not want to go into details.  I reported the gm.  I emailed the address I was given by customer support over the phone.  To make a long story short it has been over 4 months, and I have yet to recieve the FIRST response from anyone.  VI does not care about customer service.  If they tell you they do then they are lieing to you.  I wish there was some way to take them to court.  Hurt their pocketbook (or be one of the top 2.5% of uber players) and they will listen to you.  Otherwise, they dont' care about you.<P>Good luck friend.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well there is a way to get back at the poor customer service.  Stop playing.  Boycott.<P>They don't understand that this isn't some bottle of shampoo they're selling where after it leaves the factory they have nothing to do with it.  This is a community here.  Every day you are directly in their face.  This should be the ultimate in customer relations since you are always there!  But it's not.  <P>They can't expect to create a world where thousands of people spend time in everyday that nobody will complain.  You could almost say they've created a new country.

</FONT><HR>Actually there are multiple components in the ranger epic that can be wielded (Fleshbound Tome, Smiths hammer, mithril blade, ancient longsword to name a few) but I digress and that isn't the point of the thread.  I saw this on the Glade what basically happened was he was going to destroy some worthless item (probably one of those annoying no drop forages in Kunark) and hit the destroy button.  So you get the "Are you absolutely sure you want to destroy the item you are holding?" dialog.  He clicked yes, but as the buggy GUI is apt to do he clicked through the button putting the unwanted item in his inventory slot and picking up his bag.  He of course sees that the dialog is still there and clicks yes again, deleting his bag.  Most of us would click it again.<P>You can say that he should have moved the inventory window so it doesn't overlap the confirm item dialog, but really who thinks about something like that before it happens?  Not to mention that the default placement of the Inventory window overlaps the dialog box.  <P>What amazes me is the total lack of common sense displayed, whether by the GM or whoever told the GM she could not use common sense in her job.  Who would destroy all the items for their epic quest?  They ought to check the logs and refund his items.  And God forbid they could actually fix the UI so this stops happening.  The tendancy of the UI to click through items was the reason that had to institute the drop confirmation.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It says "the item you are holding" because when you get the confirm box, you can look at your pointer, say "oops!  I don't want to delete that!" and switch it with something else.<P>So let me get this straight.  You wanted to destroy an item.  You pick it up, and hit Destroy. Confirmation box comes up.  When you go to click Yes, it clicks through the box and picks up a bag and drops the item in the slot.  Then you realize the click didn't take, so you click Yes again, not checking the pointer.<P>Is that what happened?  If it is, I'm sorry, you completely did that yourself.<P>If it actually switch *at the same time* as the Yes button activated, then it's a bug... but if you clicked once and it switched, and then again and it activated the Yes button, you did it yourself.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Devorak: Your example of the lost Wurmslayer story is cute, but has nothing to do with the issue here.  Destroyed items and they way they are handled by GMs is different than items dropped on the ground and the way they are handled by GMs.<P>Suutar: A list of the items?  How big of a safety net does Verant have to weave for these folks?  Too many take the confirmation box for granted anyway and just confidently click Yes all the way through the process.
