</FONT><HR>In the last several weeks as I've been approaching the mid levels (30s and up) of my character, I've noticed one thing that is increasingly aggrivating.<P>I originally started this character, after doing extreme research to make sure that I was going to give a bang to a group, and take down mobs fast.  Unfortunately, as I've been getting higher and higher in level, this is becomming less and less apparent.<P>I feel pushed over, unneeded, useless.  It seems that around these levels, Mages are the true nuker.  They have higher dmg DD's AND Pets AND higher HP.  What the heck is this all about?<P>I have a horrible time finding groups anymore, because people are starting to realize this.  If you need a nuker, grab a Mage!  If it's in a dungeon, screw the pet, the Mage's DD's are enough, and if you only have one healer, a Mage can take a lot more damage!<P>Am I the only one noticing this?  Or have others realized that the Wizard character hasn't gotten any updates in months and months and is starting to become one of those characters that 'you can do without'?<P>I think I'll go run some teleports now.. seems to be all I'm good for..<P><BR>Nephyur Nyphyhar, Wizard of the 35th<BR>Guild Leader, Nine Realms, Lany's T'vyl</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hey remember levels 1-3 where you ran around without a pet nuking stuff? Remember when you finally got level 4 and got your first set of pet spells? Those pets made levels 4-5 a breeze, and even 6 and 7 weren't THAT hard. Well at level 4 when you got a pet and could nuke for 11 damage for 15 mana, a wizard got root and a nuke for 13 damage for 15 mana. Would you ever give up your pet so you could a nuke that does 2 more damage and get root which is resisted a lot, which breaks easy, which can't do damage for you, cannot take any damage for you, and won't let you see how much longer it might last (/pet report health)?<P>When I play my wizard it feels like I'm perpetually caught in those first few levels of being a mage without a pet.<P>I don't care if I have to be in line of sight to cast the nuke, I don't care if I have to go up and hand-deliver the nuke to the mob, as long as I am the master of direct damage.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I assume your talking about the lv 30ish range and yes the magician can posibly out damage a wizard, however in the long run, you as a wizard will be able to do many things better then a magician.  First of all, magicians only have TWO direct damage line of spells, Magic based damage and Fire based damge, A wizard has 3, magic, fire, and cold.  <BR>As a wizard when you get higher in level you will see a few things such as :<BR>you will find that your spells are resisted alot less then a magicians due to fact your spells get a built in thing makeing them harder to resist, i belive starting at lv 35 (not 100% sure, you will have to look it up)<BR>Second: Your spells when comparing damage and mana cost and casting time, Yes your spells are way more efficient then a magicians.  Cost less mana, do more damage, and cast faster, but note i said EVENTUALLY this will happen, starting in the 40s i belive is when it is most noticable, and continues to climb from there on out.<P>So yes, Wizards are the best nukers, you have the ability to do the damage the quickest, keep in mind your casting times on your spells also, you will do more damage, and it will cost you less mana.  You will also be needed in groups far more then a magician but you must be persistant in makeing it past those few hell levels were your nukeing ability is not quite up to that of a magicians, also keep in mind that the magicians biggest nukes are a bolt type spell which means that the mage must have a un-blocked direct line of sight to the mob that he is nukeing, if he does not he has to use the direct damage line of spells.<P>Wayshaper the magician<BR>(yes i have played a wizard too)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>""They have higher dmg DD's AND Pets AND higher HP. What the heck is this all about?""<P>It is about you being ignorant and probably having little to no reading comprehension abilities.<P>Mages NEVER have a higher damage DD. NEVER. NEVER. and in case you missed it, NEVER.<P>Mages do NOT have higher HP than wizards. That is based on your stamina. If you are saying this because mages are forced to take 5 staminia, you are ignoreing the fact you can put those 5 points into stamina with your bonus points.<P><BR>As a wizard you are going to be useless to a majority of groups. That is because of the way they made casters in this game. Melee damage is better 90% of the time than spell damage. The only realy use wizards have are for moving people around and killing boss mobs. If you didnt know about this when you made the character you didnt research very well, probably something to do with the reading comprehension problem.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

As for LOS problems, that's laughable under normal circumstances. My wizardess has VERY little problem landing her bolt spells. All sorts of ways to make sure there's no problem; stand on the side of the mob where there is no pet/group, stand higher up than the mob, stand in pointblank range to the mob...<P>The biggest imbalance in nuking power is that it may be possible for the magician to actually deal damage FASTER than a wizard can possibly deal damage because they have the pet attacking for them as well.<P>Arlina</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bolts are line of sight and that is a pain, we have them too so we all know the problems that Bolt spells can have.  That said, no serious Magician can say with a straight face that they should out blast a Wizard with a single blast.  Even the die hard Mages eventually will confide that they think this is wrong, they just are afraid Verant will nerf them instead of fix Wizards.  With their track record, maybe Magicians have a point.<P>Now for fun, lets look at casting times on Scars of Sigil and Draught spells!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Two things: Elawise your pet fills in the levels you don't have DD, that is part of the deal with Magicians.  Your blasts are good, almost as good as Wizards plus you have expendable tanks.  Don't tell me its so hard or Magicians would have bailed long ago on the class and they DON'T.  <P>The bottom line with this argument Magicians don't think about is that there are SEVERAL spell circles where Magicians get a bolt and Wizards get a blast... and this is the ONLY one where the bolt is more powerful than our blast.  In other words, that is a red herring, even Verant recognized that wasn't an issue, this just was a stupid, weak math problem that slipped their notice and they have yet to own up to.<P>We can only hope they'll have the dignity and pride in their work to fix it and give Wizards more damage, not nerf Magicians.<P>And Absor said HE had never heard of the innate resistance debuff, not that it didn't exist.  Abashi didn't make it up, he reported what GZ told him, in foolishly glowing terms.  There is some doubt if it's in the game, but Abashi didn't make it up.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The pet damage is true.  <P>However, If I were to let my pet tank enough to Taunt well enough to NOT aggro the Mob, then He would die, and I would have nothing, but gate...<BR>His taunt is worse than a tank 10 levels below me.

My pet hits for max maybe once a fight, and missed about 25% of the time, 50% of the hits are lower that 1/2 max. <P>I'm not saying Wizzies don't need better spells.  Both mages and wizzies need help.  <P>I think wizzie need about a 15 to 25 % DD boost at ALL levels. <P> Mages need a 25 to 35% boost in DD above 50.  Mage pet need to have their level boosted to compensate for the fact they are no longer MoB's.  Not their HP's or their attack or their AC.  Just the level.  That way they are not fighting red cons most of the time, and have a resonalble chance of taunting the mob off us.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I play a mage.. lvl 52 (Almost 53 FINALLY) and yes there are some lvls in which my nukes do out damge wizzys. HOWEVER.. there are a few otehr things..<BR>1) ALL my attack spells are limited to fire of Magic<BR>2) Even with a Malo line spell, my resists are high<BR>3) My spells on the whole ( even more so at higher lvls cast slower, and use more mana than yours<BR>4) LOS, yes outside LOS is great.. no real problem.. But in a crowded dungeon? WIth ppl running around all over the damn place? (Thinks Karnors.. *ugh*)I usually land only 60% of them with cast time thrown in<BR>5) Yes I have a pet.. without it I am a POOR wizzy. (Meaning I'm a crappy wizzy, not that wizzys are crappy/ or bad)<BR>6) Wizzys are the masters of DD, and I will give you why:<BR>a) on the whole shorter cast times<BR>b) Higher damage overall<BR>c) MUCH higher "range" of DD spells (remember you get a big fire resist and magic resist mob I can't do squat for the most part)<BR>d) Lower resist rates overall (On hate raids, the only casters that can usually land damage spells on spite golems is wizzys with Lure)<P><BR>I like being a Mage, Its fun. But I am NOT the master of DD, Pets rock, but they are not the end all and be all of DD. Remember my pet dies, or can't tuant something off me?

"<P>Yeah, there's nothing worse than being unable to have something taunted off of you Wizards NEVER run into that.<P>Magicians, what you need to do here is say "Yes, that is really messed up, Wizards should do more damage with their blasts, by a noteworthy margin than us" and stop saying stuff like that.  What are we supposed to do, be sympathetic that your pet MIGHT not be able to pull things off you?  WE DON'T HAVE THAT OPTION.<P>See, here's the hidden equasion that Magicians often miss in this discussion:<P>Magicians do more damage, with fewer resistances and less direct taunt onto themselves than Wizards do.  In fact, they can often do the same or more damage JUST AS FAST as Wizards do.  Why?  Because Damage Shields and Pets don't hit resistances.  Further, if you cast the Damage Shield before combat, it doesn't aggro on you until the source is dead.  Nor does the pet damage until the pet is dead.<P>Bottom line is this: Magicians offer everything a group invites a Wizard to do, and do it better, and that's why we use this comparison.  Yes, Wizards port, BUT THAT IS NOT WHY GROUPS INVITE A WIZARD.  Yes, Wizards can snare, but most people aren't even AWARE of it.<P>Wizards need to do fast, deadly damage with lower resistances (hmmm does the word Malise ring a bell?) and less taunt or we are always going to be devalued to a group.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

A clear margin might be something like efficiency of one specialised class can be matched by two unspeclised ones. Is this the case? Wizard nukes being twice as efficient than others? No. Difference is marginal, and on some levels quite debatable if they are better at all.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>In the nuking department wizards are better at all levels due to faster casting and quicker refreshing spells.  So the time to chain a new nuke is quite significantly better.  As well as the mana do damage ratio being set at a better level for wizards.<P>I agree with Grimstaff the fundamental problem with the game is that wizards being magic based damage should come in right at the same damage as a Dual Weilding warrior but they don't because mobs become more and more reistant to magical damage as you gain levels.<P>I've played both up to 60 now and there is a shift in soloing power that is interesting at post 50.<P>Wizards at 54+ level can spend the time/money to get a pair of jboots or sow potions and quad kite.  And magicians also have Jboots or sow potions since we cannot rely on our pets to survive tanking 100% of the time and need to be able to escape, not to mention pull things to the pet.<P>Magicians and Wizards take on the same monsters at this level there is nothing a magician can solo that a wizard cannot at this level of play.  But exp comes in 4 times faster for the wizard than the magician, why?.  <P>Because a wizard can quad kite.  And do it much better than the druid can ever hope to do, with more damaging spells that cost less mana, and AE snare.  <P>Fundamentally though soloing is not the best option for either class.  Since your gear will suffer over time if you spend too much time soloing and your tatical expertise in a group will suffer.  <P>The master use of both classes is Point Blank AE groups where you can kill 10-12 mobs at once.  Wizards have the definite edge with the Jyll's line of spells cycling these spells makes wizards the AE kings and Mages the AE queens.<P>But of course gathering 3-4 mages/wizzies in one group is about as rare as a conjuntion of the 9 planets but I've certainly made significant progress in levels with both a wizard and magician when I was leveling up to 60 using this technique.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am so tired of players looking at only 1 small piece of the picture and not looking at the whole picture.<P>Mages were always intended to be the best caster damage dealer, bar none.  Between the pet and the dds we are supposed to really lay the smackdown.  Better than wizards.  Better than necros, better than druids, better than enchanters.<P>Because of this mages have a 50% xp penalty tied to the pet.  Did you forget about this?  <P>Mages have no defensive spells what-so-ever other than gate.  Mages can't travel safely in the world with a pet.  In many zones this is suicidal.<BR>Do wizards have this same problem?  No they have many traveling and escape spells.  When was the last time a high level mage had to wait an hour or more for boat?<P>Mages dd spells cost more mana and cast more slowly.  Hell, at level 30 I recall clerics outdamage mages with their dd.  Look at the whole picture. Some levels u are good and some levels you are bad.  It is the nature of the game.<P>Wizards are great at stopping runners, very good at root and shoot making soloing actualy easier than with a mage.  I have seen wizards break a multiple spawn easily.  Mages can only handle 1 low blue mob at a time. <P>Wizards are a very balanced class in that instead of just damage they get a second usefull ability.  They get travel and escape spells.  Mages get dd and pets (glorified dots) (and some worthless summonings with a few bones).<P>I am sorry but groups don't need mages to get to the planes.  Groups dont need mages to escape in a dungeon when their is a bad pull.<P>You have made an incorrect assumption that wizards are supposed to be the masters of damage.  Your advantages are you are very good at damage (you have the most choices in how to do damage AOE, fire, cold, etc.)  This is called versatility.  Mages are much more limited and are thus not as versatile.  This is in the balance equations.<P>Should wizards get better damage even though they are more efficient and more versatile in how they damage?  Maybe.  But you have to give up something for the ggs and escapes and the skins and root and snare.  If wizards were the ultimate damage dealer and can provide escape and travel, why would anyone chose a amge in their group, for their nifty summonings of bread and water?<P>I would think you should be more worried that it is stupid to get a gg gate to WKarana so close to NKarana or a GG point in the middle of Cazic Thule making it worthless.  That there is only 1 point to gg to Kunark and that escape spells really dont work well in Kunark essentialy defeating or rendering an important ability of the wizard to a less than meaningful contribution  and that does affect class balance.<P>Please look at the whole picture before whining.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

We do the exact same single target soloing that the rest of you do.<P>Lastly, explain to me how often a wizard gets to use these quad-kiting AoE's in a group situation?

Grouping makes life easier, but there are situations where pets are just not wise to be summoned, that is a major power reducer in a group mainly due to fact mage has to root spell. So in essence a mage with out a pet is a poor excuse for a nuker.

</FONT><HR>You can always tell when a Magician hasn't played a Wizard and hasn't bothered to consider things carefully.<P>So your argument is because I can port people to the planes and snare, then I should be out damaged by a Magician both in the short AND long term?  Oh, your pet takes half your xps (maybe - there's evidence it doesn't, and Verant says otherwise, I watch my magician buddy level faster than I do soloing, so you draw your own conclusions).  My pet ... oh wait I DON'T HAVE A PET.<P>Magicians try to sweep the fact that they have an expendable taunting casting tank under the rug as if it adds nothing to a group and doesn't protect them.  As if sitting and meditating and not having to worry about greens, as if being able to walk through a low level dungeon and let your pet solo the whole damn thing means nothing.  As if using your pet to screen for you while you run to the zone is meaningless.  As if having a tank ANY TIME YOU WANT ONE for a couple gold piece gem is nothing.<P>You talk about looking at the whole picture, but you refuse to look at Magician advantages.  Here's the deal guys.<P>Magicians do big damage in the long term, they deal it out hard and without quitting (pets kill and hit while you meditate).<P>Wizards do big damage NOW, fast, in the short term.  When out of mana, Wizards contribute nothing to the group, when Wizards meditate, they are simply soaking up xps while they look at the book or around them.<P>In order for there to be any semblance of balance here, Wizards have to outgun Magicians in a MAJOR WAY for the short term, and end up roughly equal in the long term.  Why equal?  Because Magicians have several powerful advantages beyond damage they seem to desparately want to ignore:<P>-Pet and Damage Shield damage is irresistable<BR>-Pet and Damage Shield damage doesn't taunt onto the Magician<BR>-Sitting and meditating while contributing means no down time on the Mage's account for the group, a good Mage doesn't need to and shouldn't blast more than 1-2 times in a fight, controlling pet and maintaining damage shields.<P>Think about that a while.  Add to that picture the ability to lower  your resistances (what, it is unreliable?  WE HAVE NOTHING AS WIZARDS), and the picture changes slightly.<P>Bottom line is this: No single blast by a magician should ever, under any circumstances, of any kind, of any mana efficiency nor casting time do more damage than a similar levelled Wizard.  Never.  Verant might be waking up to this, according to some of Absor's comments.<P>Bottom line is this: No single blast by a magician should ever, with any delay, with any type of damage, with any mana cost EVER cast faster than a similar levelled Wizard.<P>Why GZ thought he'd be able to slip these idiotic things through without anyone noticing is beyond me, either he was incompetent and didn't look up the information, or didn't care.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Quad kiting?<BR>do you have any idea what the duration on bonds of force is? well if you don't i'll tell you, its 2 min, yes two min, and if you take into acount its cast time its range and the area that it covers, it usualy means you have to cast it atleast 10 times in the course of trying to kite 3 blues much less 4. if the mob is not snared you have to run ahead of it till you are out of range for the snare then sit there and press the cast button till they get into range, even then they will more than likly be able to hit you before you can get the spell off, so we are left to root, ok, we root the mob then snare it, well what about the other 3 mobs? now we either kite them around or root them too, now you will have to take my word for it that it is imposible to root them close enuff to each other for an aoe to get them all. so i'll kite them around till the root wears off on the one i had to snare, ok, and now i have to get them all close to each other (that means more running around, praying that my sow doesn't wear off) now i've finaly got them together i can cast one of my aoe's, oh.... wait.. the snare on the other three just wore off.....grr<P>Harvest?<BR>you say we have such an advantage with harvest? first off it takes up a spell slot, and has a refreash time of 10 min, it has a 10 sec cast time, and after that it stuns me for 10 sec. guess what it gives me?  yep about 10m big whoop. sometimes i think it would have been more efficiant if i had just sat on my butt and med'ed.<P>Evac?<BR>i have never been invited to a group on the basis of evac. and have you ever been in a group that evaced? most of the time right after you do it the group disbands, because they don't want to bother going back to the dungeon.<P>Chain casting?<BR>Let me think when do i chain cast (to make use of all them spells i have that have a shorter cast time than a mage) it not when i solo, cause that's just run, nuke run , nuke. its not in a group cause if i did i'm dead,...hmmm  <BR>IMHO i say that the cast time don't mean crap, we have to space our nukes out cause if we don't we get the agro and die, if we had a higher cast time on spell prolly a lot more newbies would live cause they wouldn't make the mistake of over nuking.<P>Basicaly i'm sorry that there are places you can't use your pet, i realize that that is the defining part of your class (not nukes). what you have to look at is if you go into a dungeon that may be a penalty (like it is for druids). but you still bring a damage sheild, a mal line, you can still nuke, and you can summon water and food for that guy that frogot to bring some.<BR>basicaly what i am saying is, ask for better pathing for your pet, heck ask for your pets to be 2x as good 4x even i don't care how good they make your pets, just don't ask for dd, you are steping on our toes....<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>That's why AE Power isn't Wizard power, it is GROUP POWER.  You can't just walk up and AE 5 things to death alone, that would be a measure of the power of a Wizard.  You need an enchanter and another Wizard or other AE caster (or two) and a healer and a puller is a good idea.<P>AE grouping is GROUPING and requires a good, full group to do, it should be Verant's wet dream, and they should do everything in their power to make it more useful and happen more often.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I see you still don't understand.  They are not going to buff mage pets because then the tanks complain that pets are better than them. Hell they do that now anyway to the point where they have been nerfed quite a bit.<P>Mages need their dds but they are very limited.  They are either fire or conjuration.  They are rains or bolts or dds.  If you are fighting a fire resistant mob you may have to use a spell that is more than 10 levels beneath your current level (depending upon the mage level and dungeon.)<P>Wizard have more options...this means something i the balance equation, but it seems all you see is the raw numbers.<P>The way I see it and what you seem to be missing is that when they developed the wizard class they gave you escape and travel spells and they gave mages good dd and pets.<P>I can accept the argument that travel/escape plus other defensive spells may not be equal to having a pet, or they would be if they were implemented better.  But that is where the argument is.  You are not looking at the repercussions of your wish.<P>By upping the wizard damage from dds, you make the class even more soloable than they are now, and if they raised wizard damage and nerfed mages dd then there would be no compelling reason to play a mage now would there?  <P>Hang your egos at the door.  You (Wizards) are supposed to be good, versatile damage dealers. Not damage gods.  <P>As a mage I would gladly give up my self point blank AoEs for a travel spell even if it was a self only ggs. Hell I might take a little less damage dds for that ability and a root or snare.  But it aint gonna happen.<P>If groups aren't using evac that in itself is a problem right there.  Evac is supossed to be a significant ability for the wizard class and if it is not being used then I would support a claim that that ability is out of balance and needs to be made better.<P>But as a mage I am not going to support a thread that wants to make me as a mage obsolete beacuse all a mage has to get into a group is his/her superior damage capability and that is not often enough these days with the new melee weapons coming into the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
