</FONT><HR>I was already a master smith and close to master tailor when the last craft skill upgrade came out ... it was not all i wanted but it defently was a step in that direction ( with the bazillion things out their that a bazillion players think need to be dont RIGHT NOW i was happy to see any improvement to the craft skills)<P>Tailoring got a big bost from the added silks and more patterns (this realy helped tailoring) ... smithing got some weapons finly (thou thay cost too much to make to be profitable) ... pottery got mana vials for the new enchanter spells (the reason i mastered pottery) ... a lot of broken things where fixed for a lot of the skils ...<P>So what will be next (when is just a matter of time) ...<P>First of id like to see more broken things fixed , like the meny broken studded armor parts , reinforced mask , and the quivers ...<P>And talking about tailoring , studded armor is leather armor with studs ADDED , id like to see the studded 1 AC better than leather ,(now it cost about the same to make as buying leather) , and reinforced get a +1Ac too , this would make them sellable items instead of things you have to make to get to backpacks ...<P>Id also like to see a smith made dagger , and posibly a smith made throwing weapon of some sort ... the smith can make a weapon for any class but the casters ...<P>Then their would be new things for craft skills ... ALL the craft skill ...<P>For smiths , magic forged weapons would be the next step , needing mana vials , all the things the normal weapons needs , and a few 'special' componets to make shure its not too easy ... if the production cost was about half that of the buy price of combine (but eeding some work) smiths could then make some cash doing smithing ...<P>And Smith made plate mail ... it would be hard to make (higher trivial AND more exspensive steel sheets to make as well as tailor made armor straps) this would be above the bronze/banded but beloe the quest armor ACs ... if the production price is right it would be sellable yet not too much so (balance is best)<P>tailors , how about a 6 slot bag in the 30 to 40 skill range for lower end tailors to make , not a big seller but usefull ... also a higher grade of silks for casters would be nice , Fine Silk armor ... a point or two better AC per location but much harder to make (trivial level and production cost , it might need a new type of brew , like Kiola Tonic or some such , or maybe another componet to add cost)  <P>brewing and Bakeing ... theis skills could use something a player would find usefull , like a brew that restors fatige , a bread that absorbe some poison damage , ect ... nothing on par with alchemesty potions but still something that a player would think worth lugging around and useing , and therefor worth paying for ...<P>pottery ... a ceramic lamp (light sorce) , and a higher level magic lamp (very good light sorce) ... (not much room here)<P>Jewlery ... the jewlery skill already reaches 200 skill with a full range of items but dose not iteract with the other crafts skills ... bejewled hilt / pommel for magic blades ?  bucles / buttons /clasps for new magic tailored items ? <P>Fletching could be expanded to cover all wood working weapons , like staves and clubs  (and combine a smith made dagger and fletcher made staff to make a spear) <P><BR>Then their is the posibility for more quests to need crafted items , this is a great way to add legs to the less traved craft skills like bakeing/brewing/pottery ... the quest would have traveling , getting a few hard or semi rare drops , and makeing 1 or more hard craft items ... you could take it further and have a few quests that need several crafted items from diferent skills , like a large jar made with special clays/water (to mix in) , a brew needing hard to find items (for maranading), a baked food needing high level monster meats to make a special kind of food , all given together for a suitable reward ...<P>just some things id like to see in the craft skills down the road , like some of them ? dont like some of them ? have a few ideas of your own ... lets get the ball rolling and get a good idea of what we al think would make the craft skills better <P>(please no "super special" items or "it would be great for my class if" things ... id like to see things that help all craftsmen , not a select few)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Nice list, just a small addition.  All those spiderling silks could be used to tailor something *cough*bandages*cough*.<BR>Think about it they sell for what 15c and buy back from merchs at 4s.  slap two of them together for a bandage and you've got a lost loot cost of 3s at the most and you could sell for 4 and still beat the merch cost of bandages.  Pretty fine work though, probably triv somewhere between 36 and 82 (wink). then you really have an alternative to taking up smithing just to learn to sew.  Nice on more mature servers where nobody buys raw silk anyway.  Of course you wouldn't want the triv too high or it would be too cheap to advance.  Just wishful thinking on my part though we'll never see it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>How about a blacksmith made shield ... thay already make weapons and armor ... and of course with more cost/items be able to produce a magic shield (maybe protection from missles , better parry odds , ect)<P>And for a little more far out idea ... bound pet totems ... a smith would combine enchanted metal (silver/gold/ect , higher for higher level pets) with a statuet mold (pottery made , diferent types for the diferent types of pets) ... then a jewler would combine the statuet with diferent gems for the diferent types/level pets (by setting the gems into the statuet) to make a pet totem for a specific type of pet (with higher/lower level totems for each type of pet) ... thay can pe sold to casters who would target them and cast a pet into the totem (and thay would become lore/no drop at this time) ... then at a later date the caster could right click on the totem to instanty release the pet (summon it from the totem without casting a spell then) ... this would let pet users have backup pets for when thay low/out of mana IF thay want to PAY for it (cost a lot to make in first place) ... this adds crafter interaction , pull cash out of the economy (cash sink hole) and allows the caster to have a one shot pet backup , if he willing to pay the jewler for it ,who in turn has to pay the blacksmith for the statuet , who in turn has to pay the potter for the mold ... trickle down economics in action.<P>With the bound pet totems a pet useing caster could pay for a one shot backup , and when used , or thay get better pet , could pay for another/better totem ... with them being 1 shot use thay would consume cash but at the same time add a bit of a safety net to the pet dependent caster (if only a one shot backup , cant make it too easy) ... as well as add something other than jewlery for jewlers to produce/sell (and a repeat buisness factor too , people would have favoret jewlers instead on buying this ior that needed item and moveing on) ... the trick as always would be the production cost vs viable use , the potter would have to be high skill to make the molds (and lots would be needed , adding income to potters) ... the smith would need enchanten metals forcing smith/enchanter interaction as well as smith/potter interaction ... then the jewlers would have to buy from the smith and buy gems too , putting the production into the cost range of a jewlery item , atthis cost for a one shot item the fail rate should be low (to keep cost down) and the upper end metal/gems only for the highest level pets ... put when that critters hitting you too much to cast a pet youll be happy you payed to have one a click away.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Yup, I agree with all the above, though I would like to throw out the obvious questions of:<BR>1. Why weren't Smiths allowed to make shields in the first place?<BR>2. Why, if Enchanters can enchant METALS, weren't they allowed to enchant METAL SHEETS (I mean is this a "Duh" question or what?) so Smiths could make magic armor?<BR>and <BR>3. Why only a Bastard Sword, 2H sword and Morning Star? Why not (like metioned above) a Dagger? (Again, "Duh" or no?) and then refer to my #2 question for the weapons as well. I mean, isn't there ANY Tolkien in this game? Elves and Dwarves and Humans getting together to make magical weapons and armor?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"> <P>Love the game, but the Trade Skills need a tad more respect from the higher level people. Trade people can agree with me, I hope, that for all their Hacking and Slashing and spellcasting, who did they come to, in the olden days to repair their equipment? Well, since it's all non-damageable here, let's be able to make unique items (Tailors, Smiths, Brewers, Bakers, Potters) that those High-level guys and gals would be willing to make an effort for.<BR>Okay and my addition to the wish list:<BR>How about taking those hard to find quest items and making them useful to add to trade skill produceables (which, currently is really just the unique gems for jewelers) to make High-level worthy items?<BR>I believe there are a whole two or three quests that involve getting a smith to help you. Well, what if that Plane of Hate nasty dropped a chemical that a Smith could make magic armor with or a Brewer could make a powerful drink out of or a Potter could make a totem stronger with?<BR>Nuff said?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Calleighn on Tribunal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I posted this elsewhere, but I figured i ought to drop it in here too. It seems to fit with the subject. I've heard some rumors of the following floating around the Karana server. If it is just a rumor, It would be nice to see it implemented with all of your other suggestions. Well, here they are:<P>Rumor #1 "Steel Bow Staves are availeable. A Blacksmith has to make them in the propper mold"<BR>Would be nice to see this along with the aforementioned smith made arrow heads or other components (steel shafts, etc).<P>Rumor #2 "Ceramic Bow Staves are availeable. A Potter (or whatever the person that makes items out of clay is called) has to make them"<BR>Again, would provide nice interaction with another trade skill. Heck - all ceramic components for arrow making would be nice! Not to forget the idea of potters makeing all the molds!<P>Rumor #3 "Gnomish Tinkers can construct a scope that can be used in the construction of a bow". Rumors it is supposed to increase your "to hit" roll or perhaps provide a screen zoom for targeting??!!?!??? (sound's outlandish - would love it to be true!)<P>Rumor #4 "Steel Vane arrow components are going to become availeable. It's attributes are Dmg +3 Rng -"<BR>Again to go with the smithing interaction.<P>Don't remember if this was mentioned, but, how about having enchanters being able to enchant the components that are needed in the construction of smithing/fletching/tailoring items to create other magical items. I know that magic arrows can be fletched. But, what I mean is and arrow that is +1 dmg or does fire damage, etc.<P>How does expanding the enchanter spell list to include spells to make these type of enchantments possible?<P>And my final 2cp...<P>How about Rogues being able to apply poison to our crafted items.<BR>How does a poisoned tiped (magic?) arrow, or a poisoned (magic?) sowrd/axe/mace sound!?!?? eh?<P>Now, don't think I'm biased to enchaners. I myself play a ranger. I just feel that if you are going to make trade items, we ought to do it right! Especialy sence the role-playing traditions have always had an enchanter behind the scenes somewhere, I feel that the class ought to live up to its name.<P>I also feel that certain classes/races should excell (or at least level "better") in certain trades. After all, (in traditional fantasy) who has ever heard of a Gnomish fletcher/archeror? When I think of a Gnome I think of a tinker that creates various "technologically advanced" strange items rangeing from mundane to outlandish uses. Dwarves, I think of a Brewer and a Smith. When I think of a wood elf, I think of a Brewer and a Fletcher. High Elves, all finely crafted items such as clothing and jewelery. Halflings, cullenary delights. Barbarians, Smiths. I think you get my point.<BR>I'm not saying that ANY race can't do any trade skill. Just that SOME races should find certain skills easier or rather almost "inate" then others. I might be a little out there, but I think it adds to the racial or class specific completeness.<P>What do you guys think?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>All I can say is I am getting pretty tired of Players not In-the-know asking me if I can make magic armor and weapons..  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><BR> I've resolved to answer this question from now on with "Yes, I can make the Armor of Ro, just get me the components." This usually either makes 'em laugh or keeps them quiet. Problem solved.<BR> At any rate, I would not be against seeing Rogues able to poison blades for a 1 charge DoT or DD effect if the proc went off. I suppose Shadowknights might also be privvy to that ability, but that's just cause it seems like an evil thing IMHO.<BR> I also posted somehwere else that the idea of BLESSED weapons by Clerics and/or Paladins might also be a nifty idea. Why give the Enchanter all the fun with magic weapons?<BR> As for the matter of Steel Staves, I haven't heard that anywhere else, so who knows? The silly pottery dieties give us a light smack on the cheek saying that we are now the ONLY trade that cannot manufacture magical items unless it is a quest item.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><BR> Cmon, now. A YEAR and nobody has found the source to Smiths making magical armor? Let alone the beta players.. If it didn't come out by now, how can we think it lies in there somehwere already.. But, I digress.<BR> As far as the race thing, I can't say anything, since different stories breed different ideas. Even Tolkien made Elves Master Smiths as well as Jewelers. I wouldn't want to put an onus on any races, but I am not discounting that idea, so please don't be offended.<P> At any rate, my desire for Smithing has come down to making armor for my guild-mates when they need it and very little more. My Tailoring always needs silks so I can make cured armor to rarely sell to Monks and simply get my skill to making the 10 slot backpacks. Who CAN'T use a 10 slot backpack, right?  So Who CAN use a banded gorget, these days, huh?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Calleighn on Tribunal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Okay here's my 2cp worth folks.<P>We all know that smithes want to be able to make magical armor/weapons.  I know I do!  Other skills have their problems as well, with the exception of Jewelry. <BR>Just as a concept, to allow a more diverse equipment range, allow clerics to Bless Metals, Ores, Clay, etc, and Necros to Curse the Same, and allow the manufacture of holy/unholy equipment.<BR>With that in mind, put a new trade Craft in the Game.  <BR>Wood Craft -- allows the making of staves for Bows, and the manufacture of Wooden weapons, for all you blunt weapon wielders, boxes, arrow shafts, maybe even a Crossbow! (heh) <BR>in conjunction give the druids a new spell,<BR>Living Wood -- allows the enchantment of the rough wood componant for making magical items with the Wood Craft Skill.  <BR>Just a thought<P>Kaledin Stoneforge<BR>Holy Warrior of the 22nd Hall of Underfoot<BR>Master Smithe<BR>Vigil Knights<BR>Povar<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Kaledin, the 'carpentry'-like skill would be a good thing.  There's plenty of items, some in-game already, others that can be invented, that could be on a product list for such a trade.<P>Bazhill, you mention that Verant should fix broken recipes, and I completely agree.  But I'm not positive that quivers belongs on your list.

</FONT><HR>Quivers will always be broken until you can equip them in your 'ammo' slot.<P>There is exactly NO USE for quivers, except as a role-playing tool.  Large bags outperform quivers in every way, except style.  And, since general inventory doesn't show up on an inspect...<P>By the way - how cool would it be if making a magical sword was as easy as putting in the metal/molds for the bastard sword, throwing in a bottle of mana, and the spell scroll (Lifetap).
