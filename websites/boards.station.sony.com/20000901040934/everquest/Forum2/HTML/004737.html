&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Starting August 27th, the new events launch with the first of the “Best of the Best” series, that will pit the greatest of the servers against the greatest of the servers. During this week all servers will run the Warriors Championship. Rules for this event are simple, with no artifacts, no buffs, and no right clicking on any item (but wearing activatable items is acceptable, just not the use of those items). <P>These events will not have any entry fee, but players must be of 55th level or greater to enter. The winner of the event will be given a title of “The Champion” which is the 51st level title of the class. All of “The Champions” will be copied to Test Server, so that on Sunday at Noon (PST) all of the champions will face each other. Those that place (4th, 3rd, and 2nd places) will receive their 59th level title, and the winner of the “Main Event” will be dubbed the 60th level title (the Warlord).<P>Security for these events will be absolute, with Lake Rathetear shut down on Test Server for the duration of the event. The only characters that will be allowed in the Arena on Test Server will be the Events Staff, the Champions of each server, and possibly some members of the press who are covering the events. All others who come into the arena via gating in or having logged out there will be summoned out of the arena and binded in a far away land by a member of the event staff as soon as the player is discovered. There will be no exceptions to this.<P>After the event, all characters copied to test will be deleted, and titles will be given to the characters on their respective “live” server’s characters. This is to insure that the Test Server does not receive added players or items. Security measures will be in place to make sure that no items from the “live” servers end up in the hands of the Test Server. I know that there were concerns with this with the original announcement of bringing the champions to the Test Server, but rest assured that actions will be taken against those responsible IF something happens, not the server itself.<P>www.everquest.com will also carry all information and standings of the events for this great event.<P>At the conclusion of the warrior’s competition, a random roll will determine the next class that will have the excitement of this style event. The titles awarded again will be 51st level title for the winners of the server competition, the 59th level title for the runners up, and the 60th level title for the grand champion of that specific class Norrath-wide.<P>There will be a week of normal events that all levels and classes can enjoy, then the week of the new classes competitions start. This is so that all levels, races, and classes get to have fun with the events. When it comes to the game-wide championships, those will be dedicated only to the 55th level or higher players. One week dedicated to all levels, then a week dedicated to the class specific events that will determine the best of each class in the game.<P>More information should be released early next week, including official rules and regulations of the Warriors Event. The Events Staff and myself look forward to bringing you these new events.<P>Lady Daegarmo “The Faithful”<BR>Online Events Coordinator <BR>Verant Interactive<P><font color="cyan">[Due to some problems with eyestrain, paragraphs have been added for your protection:]</font><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]

</FONT><HR>This may be a silly Idea, heavens know I've had em before.  But, anyway though it would be kinda cool to setup a sever (arena only) 1, for things like this, 2, when not being used for this anyone on any server could "copy" onto it, that way anyone from any server could go into it with a copy of the char that want, not worrying about anything(death XP lost equ) because it would not affect the real image of the char.. maybe next to the enter world, delete button have a arena button, it copies your char to the arena server, and when you leave it/camp it just wipes it (the char copy)... and when you have special event, just disable the Arena button or lock the server.  Hehe anyway, just after reading about using the test server and mirror of the char files it seem kinda like a good idea..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>EQ is a players vs environment game. Why are you expending all this effort on a pvp competition? Combat is determined through forumlas based on levels and equipment. This isn't a game like Street Fighter where a series of 1 on 1 matches would actually prove who is a better Ryu player. How does a competition like this prove who is best of the best? Who the hell cares anyway? <P>Ask for groups of players, then send them on a scavenger hunt on a test server empty of players. Then reward people who did it fastest, least deaths, etc. <P>Maybe do it on a live server with each 'group' being a guild. Competition brackets being determined by guild size, level distribution. <P>since you want to give level 55+ characters spomething special, setup a under-used dungeon with higher level mobs and see which group of 6 can crawl the farthest.<P>I applaud your efforts to set up events, but pvp matches are out of place in a pve game.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>"Everybody knows that unless you can cast there is absolutely no strategy or skill of any kind involved in EverQuest."<P>How much of this is the game engine's fault, and how much the players'?  Do *YOU* follow The Strategy(tm)?  (The Strategy(tm) being a group of Tanks, Enchanters, Clerics, Support[optional: Druid | Pet Caster | Wizard].)<P>Explain to me this:<P>Was in the Lower Tower (LT--I think it means "Lower Tower") in Lower Guk the other day.  We had an enchantress.  Her mesmerisations, enthralls, and other "goodies" weren't sticking, so she died alot, despite our cleric's best attempts at keeping her alive.  Plus, there was some...er...confusion amongst the tanks as to who was assisting whom.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>These were mutally exclusive things, by the way, as we only had two tank types, but several mobs; the ones that weren't being "confused" by the tanks (reduced to two or three at most) were being led away by the Enchantress and killing her (since her spells wouldn't ever stick).<P>So I suggest AE stun/AE nuke tactics instead.  OH HELL NO.  It's "too dangerous."<P>What does this have to do with the strategy of tanks?  Well, to be frank, a strategy consisting of something different than The Strategy(tm) might require the tank to do something more than F8, a, Taunt-Bash|Kick|&c, rinse repeat.<P>But it's "too dangerous."<P>LMAO.<P>PS: I'm not saying game mechanics don't limit it at all.  Far from it--I think they're a much larger contribution than player cowardliness.  But not so much as PLAYERS think.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Lady_Daegarmo,<P><BR>I'm going to be real straight up about this, I think it sucks. One one hand its truly an exciting event that invokes some real interest. Kudos! However on the other it really shows where Verants priorities are. Why put this _much_ effort into an event that benefits so little of the player base? And at the same time is so targeted to a specific minority: warriors level 55+? And we know who this show is really geared for: uber guild warriors that are 55+. It was kind of like that silly guild event on Solusek Ro in which all the guilds were assembled for an all out assault on Qeynos....and who won, well of course our resident uber's...great good for them, the outcome was a virtual no-brainer...and the event was rather boring unless you were one of the large guilds that could even attempt it.<P>I understand that from your position it is difficult to set up events that everyone appreciates, but I think there is a lot of room for improvement over what you have offered [in terms of the 55+ warrior arena bash].<P>If Verant is going to dedicate time and energy towards server-wide events please do something that involves more people and offers them more opportunity for enjoyment.<P><BR>It would be rude of me to critize you and then leave you with no ideas, so I will suggest a couple:<P>1. War of Hate II<P>2. Battle of Lesser Fay...involving the good races against a combined army of Mayong's minions from Mistmoore, Crushbone orcs, undead from Unrest, and maybe a contigent of trolls from Grobb along with a couple dark elf wizards/necromancers.<P>3. Introduction of a lesser dragon that leaves Kunark and decides to settle somewhere on Faydwer. A dragon that is geared for multiple groups level 35-45.<P>4. Class specific arena bash's that are more open to all levels of the specific class.<P>5. Seige of Halas by the goblins of Permafrost and the Gnolls of Blackburrow. I mean you can even introduce several new quests that give hints of a coming alliance-offensive.<P>6. An on-going epic quest that stretches across all continents. I know this is vague but im sure with some ingenuity and manpower this could be implemented. I guess I'm thinking of something on the scale that the Ring Quest was to Middle Earth.<P>these are just examples. All of which can be greatly supported by the introduction of new quests, new items, new NPCs, past "empty" areas now inhabited by monsters, new faction etc etc. I think a broadening and general increase in the depth of Norrath would be more appreciated than what is currently offered in the form of high level championships and high level guild-city raids.<P>Belegir Swiftbow<BR>Ranger of 45 seasons<BR>Druzzil Ro<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well I think it is just lovely that events are going to be held.  But Im sorry there are several problems with this.<P>First off, the test enviroment shouldn't be used at all.  There is no guarenttee that the contestants will be bug free. Granted that there are bugs in the live enviroment however the chances of a really bad bug showing up in a testing enviroment is very likely.<P>Secondly you will be giving a level 55 character the same title as a level 51 character?!?!?! To me this just seems wrong.  I personally wouldn't enter in this contest just for that reason alone if I had a level 55+ warrior.  In my humble oponion, a unique title should be give.<P>Thirdly, Security will be enforce so that next to no one can see the final out come. How then can we be sure that it was a fair fight?  How do we, the average player, know that the staff involved in the competition isn't going to rig the fight?  Now I can understand that you dont want 200K people on test and in the same zone.  But atleast open up something like a movelog and do a random drawing as to who can log into test and watch the fight would seem fair.  <P>Forthly, I can understand you wanting to enforce your secuirty however taking a character that was bound in the arena and binding them "In a far away land" just because someone forgot or never knew about the contest logged in, should be consider cruel and unusual punishment.  I would suggest that you inform them that they can't be there, offer to put them in a place they would like to be instead or force them to log. Simple as that.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  But by binding them somewhere that they don't know or don't want to be bound at is bad customer service.  Also, it leads me to believe that the staff just might be cruel enough as to bind them in a place that they are KoS at.  <P>I don't want to come across as unappreciative in this message because I do appreciate the effort involved here.  However, I just think that although it sounds like a good idea on the surface, it just needs to be further thought out.<P>Genna</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I'm not sure what the chemical imbalance that makes all of us Sol Ro players feel a need to post, but there are a few flaws with this..<P>Nobody gets to watch.<P>The people that get invited and get to participate are already probably amongst the "haves" and not the "have nots."  The warrior battles *WILL* be a result, primarily, of superior equipment, level, internet connection type, and circle-strafe skill.<P>It's not to say that were my class chosen next that I wouldn't want to participate.  I think I'd do well; but as a necro I'll still fall short to another Defiler or Warlock with his deep-Kunark and Plane of Sky drop items (the extra couple hundred hitpoints from some REAL a-list items will make the difference assuming moderately good tactics) because his guild was powerful enough to do these things.  <P>This is *not* a gripe.  I absolutely respect and have a certain healthy envy for better equipped Defilers and Warlocks than myself (and the truth be told, I'm fairly well dressed myself).  If a contest is held to determine who the most powerful one of the bunch is, they CERTAINLY do deserve to win it.<P>...but what happens here is that you take those who have the most, and you give them more.  ...and those of us who aren't on top don't even get to watch  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>Please don't make this a closed viewing event.<P>Palimax Sceleris<BR>Defiler of Bertoxxulous<BR>Solusek Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>i agree. This event rewards uber guilds and randomness. The game is 99% PvE and major events should reflect this. Events like this should be reworked, so as you maybe time a group as they run through a well rounded dungeon (ie Najena....undead/living/traps/locked doors/etc.) and kill a named GM spawned mob....buff/debuff the mobs so even lower level groups can have a chance, and not just 55+ uber guild members. Make it a group of 6 with 1 extra person to either just add help the group or do whatever (would help if a group member dies, or could pull for the main group...or make 2 small groups...etc.). The group that kills that gm mob the fastest wins some reward (titles) and a chance to compete vs other servers' winners on the test server for very amazing artifacts (after all they will have been proven to be the best group in *all* of EQ).<P>Granted you'd have to buff the mobs for a group of lvl 50+s and debuff the mobs for a group of lvl ~20s, but then every established (no uber guilds breaking up and forming a dozen small guilds, just to get an upper hand in the event) guild on each server would have a chance, no matter what level, and no matter whether they own Kunark or not.<P>EQ is PvE afterall, reward people on that fact alone (cept maybe for PvP servers) and not the super minority of PvP practiced warriors in uber guilds lvl 55+.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Just to make sure we are all reading off the same scroll here, a few points<P>First, these competitions will be every other week.  This leaves a week of competitions that are designed for the other levels on the server.<P>Warriors were chosen because it will be the easiest of all the classes (Save maybe Monk) to judge, and I would like to test the Event Staff out on the easiest class to judge first.<P>As for fairness, remember there will be no less then 4 judges at this event, 30-some competitors, and myself at the final event on Test Server.  If you have ever worked or grouped with high level characters, I assure you that they dont normally miss a detail, and are very verbal if they see something that is incorrect.  I am certian that it will be fair.<P>As for equipment, the only items under review at this time are those with delays of 10 and 11, but all other items will be allowed.  Why take away what players have earned?<P>I saw the remark about the PvP server's warriors going to crush the Non-PvP server's warriors.
