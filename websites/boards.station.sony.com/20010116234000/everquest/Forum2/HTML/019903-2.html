</FONT><HR>I'm sorry, but a GM getting involved in that is completely ridiculous. It sounds like the either the GM was a personal friend of the player screaming about getting scammed, OR she was unfamiliar with protocol regarding dropped things.<P>to the original poster, how did the person blaming your son find out that he had the backpack? Did they see him pick it up? Did he say something over the chat channels? <P>The reason I ask is that someone ELSE may have walked inbetween the person who originally had the backpack and the intended recipient and the screaming player didn't see the name in the trade window and just clicked on the trade button. I've seen that one happen before, and I've seen newbies run back and forth between me and someone i'm talking to in hopes of recieving items i'd intended for someone else. If the screamer didn't see the name and just saw someone drop a backpack, they might have assumed that your son was the person who took off with their items.<P>Someone else may have gotten the backpack, taken the valuable items and dropped the backpack then run off... Then your son innocently picks it up, wondering what it was. <P>I admit, I pick up little bags off the ground all the time. I LOVE finding foragers castoffs.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"> I use the grubs to fish and the fruits/veggies to brew/bake. If I ever see a backpack under someone I pick it up and IMMEDIATELY initiate a trade window with them with their fallen items in it, just in case they don't know they dropped it. I KNOW I'm honest, I don't know who else is, so I'd rather pick it up myself than tell them and leave it to chance that they'll get it before someone else does.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Pretty obviously, it was a Guide, rather than a GM, that spoke with you (and rather rudely, to go by your description).  Level 50 generally indicates a Guide rather than a GM or an Apprentice Guide, and they did mention getting their GM to check your son's inventory.<P>Guides shouldn't be taking that sort of action against people (i.e., forcing someone to return equipment in that situation).  Their responsibility in those cases is to gather information and report it to their GM as soon as possible to complete the investigation.<P>Besides, if you put something down on the ground on purpose, it becomes fair game for other players, NPCs, and even automatic zone cleanup.  There are no guarantees whatsoever that the items will still be there when you get back.  And that other player should have realized this rather than being immature and shouting accusations across the zone.<P>Oh, also, I have no sympathy for self-twinkers, so I'm glad your son picked up that bag.  May he enjoy the fruits and vegetables contained therein!   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>To "a_cleric00" :<P>Just because someone chooses to drop an item on the ground to exchange with another one of their characters doesn't make them an "idiot", I would say they are a gambler.  I for one will find remote inn rooms all the time to camp two of my characters and do the "drop to ground, /g, log on with alternate, and pick up" thing all the time to exchange anything from 2000pp to a simple bag of food and water.  I know the risk and am willing to take them, but I'm not an "idiot" for doing it, an idiot would be someone that things that a person has no right to pick up something they dropped on the ground for anyone to pick up.  As for the rest of this post, I'm in agreement with all of you.  A GM had no business getting involved in this incident, the dropper should now the risk and must be willing to lose the item if trying to exchange items this way.<P>Just my 2cp worth.<P>Jordanon Purethought, 33 Enchanter<BR>Lanys T'Vyl<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hmmmm. Lisset, did you even read that post before you responded? Cause it doesn't seem like it, you apparently completely missed the part where he said he WAS WILLING to take the risk of dropping items. Read and understand before you flame. <P>Personally, I've dropped items before (not often, only when I had no friend or guildmate to help me trade), with full knowledge of the risks. Usually it's for reasons of convenience, such as wanting to trade with another player but not being able to take my char that holds the item into a certain area, or being able to get another character there faster, etc. Once or twice I've done it when I was a plat or three short of an item or spell I needed. Whatever the reason, I agree that it's MY risk and the apprehension I feel when logging between the two chars proves that I know it, which certainly doesn't make me an idiot. But if you want to make another post saying I'm wrong because people who drop stuff for this reason are idiots when they aren't ready to take the risk, go to. It's amusing, actually.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Contrast this thread, with another recent thread where a person found a yak on the ground near a bank, and waited for about 20 mins or so for someone to attempt to claim it.  The person who dropped it contacted a GM, who looked thru the logs, found out who picked it up and gave out the name of the person who dropped it.<P>These threads are certainly an interesting study in contrasts.  In one thread - if you drop it, it's fair game - in the other thread, if you drop it, the GM will will go to the effort of going thru logs and telling who picked it up.<P>All of this is silly, in light of the drop confirmation option.  You drop it, generally you're out of luck.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I don't know about anyone else, but if a GM showed up and demanded I return an item I found on the ground, whether someone dropped it by accident (that's what the warning dialogue box was made for) or they were twinking a character, I wouldn't turn it in.<P>You run a risk of permanently losing an item if you drop it, and your reasons for doing so don't justify involving a GM. I read elsewhere that GM's are stepping into player conflicts because a few months ago people complained that they didn't do enough. Well, with a motto like "We're here to help," people are going to get the idea that a GM will help them with anything. "Helpful" to me is getting my body back under a wide range of circumstances, getting every little item I lost through a zone, death, etc. Obviously I was wrong, but the motto *is* misleading. After dealing with a few GM's in my first three months, their motto should really be "We're here to report and enforce."<P>But back to the wyrmslayer example... If I found something, and the owner found out that I had their item, I'd made them bargain for it. I have an extensive wish list.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> If they whined to a GM, and the GM actually showed up demanding I return it, here's what I'd do: I'd destroy the item.<P>GM involvement needs to be cut back.

</FONT><HR>I have dropped stuff on the ground to pick up by another character before.  Oh about four times in five the items are even still there when I log with the other character.  <P>Yes I expect and know there is a risk of loss of the items and yes do NOT drop extremely valuable items just newbie junk like cheap armor and FS weapons which are great for the twinkee and no big loss to the twinker character so its cool if its gone when I re-log no big loss.  <P>Dropping 1k worth of jewelry is a complete no brainer my guess would be the GM was a person who also has a separate player account and was trying to leverage their authority to make you give it up should get a definite slap we really do not need any GM's of that category.<P>If you have that much value you need transferred then go get a friend or guildmate to help you transfer the stuff or use your head and transfer one item at a time so your biggest lost would be one item or hey how about get a second account yourself.<P>Kids over say age 7 or 8 are fine playing EQ.  Both my younger ones play - one doesnt care for the game anymore already and the other gets a bit emotional when he dies..  They need a kids server where death is handled differently than the others for kids who can't always do corpse runs as well as adults can handle because I'm tired of helping get "The Body!" for him.  Other than that he is fine.  It's a bit tricky teaching them to be fair and not ninja loot and loothound when grouped but they gradaully temper that behavior (somewhat) which is a good lesson for life as well that complete greed is not ideal.<P>Just wish I could customize the language filter a bit more personally to also include a few common mispellings used to get around the filter such as they filter the word damn but not a dozen others which are far worse.  <P>Oh yes the Ignore filter also VERY MUCH needs to be increased from 20 to more because I'm sorry to report you got WAY more than 20 idiots on your average server and I need room to add that GM hehe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hooray Abashi!<P>The GM/Guide was wrong to get involved. I too try to go to a place away from both PCs and NPCs before doing a trade. Things drop and it does need to be fixed.<P>BTW, Lisset, thank you for your intelligent, witty, and well phrase comments.

</FONT><HR>I have no problem with Verant deciding that GMs will no longer help people retrieve things dropped now that there's a drop confirmation box.<P>HOWEVER, I have run into two situations recently where the drop confirmation box is ineffective.  In one sitatuation, I had 5k of platinum on my mouse cursor and tried to give it to someone in order to buy an item from them.  They moved as I tried to click them and the platinum dropped on the ground, WITH NO DROP CONFIRMATION BOX (I do have it turned on).  Thak god I was able to pick it up before anyone else in the crowded bank got it.  Obviously in the future I will wait until someone puts the item in my window before I put up the platinum, but it's far too easy to make an innocent mistake with the current setup and drop money accidentally.  And the policy is that the GMs won't help in this situation?  This seems highly unfair.<P>In another situation, I had quested for a paw of opalla with a friend.  For some reason he was carrying the paw on the mouse cursor with a full inventory.  He put the paw up in the trade window and the recipient cancelled and said he needed to get money.  The paw dropped on the ground _with no drop confirmation box_ and was picked up by someone else.  After petitioning, my friend was informed that the GMs would no longer help with such a situation (because of the drop confirmation box, which failed to display).  Admittedly carrying the paw with a full inventory was not a wise thing to do, but it still seems to me that the drop confirmation box should have either appeared when the trade was cancelled, or the paw should have returned to the mouse cursor, or it shouldn't allow a trade to be initiated with a full inventory, or _something_.  If this is somehow programatically infeasible, I think the responsibility should fall back to the GMs to deal with these "software limitation" issues when they arise.  As it is, I and my friend are out 25 or so hours of work getting the paw and the GMs say they can't do anything to help.<P>I saw a similar situation in nfp when someone purchased a wurmslayer and didn't have any inventory space (which is easy to not notice).  The wurmslayer dropped on the ground and was picked up by someone else.  An ooc argument went on for the next hour at least as some claimed the item was on the ground and thus ffa, others said a GM would help, others offered rewards for the item's return, etc.  I don't know how the situation was resolved, but presumably the gms went with the official policy of not being able to do anything.  I can see a similar problem occuring when you buy something from a merchant or turn in quest items for a container type reward.  If the item is a container and you have no more slots your purchased or reward item drops to the ground and anyone can pick it up before you do.  I had this happen buying a backpack a few times, though picked it up before anyone got it.  Again, I think the npc should not allow you to complete the transaction if you don't have room.  Merchants won't sell you non-container items when you don't have room, so why do they sell containers?  All these sitatuations seem to be loopholes in an otherwise sensible system for keeping items from accidentally dropping to the ground.  If they can't or won't be fixed, I say again that the GMs must pick up the slack and set things right when a loophole adversely affects a player.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019903-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019903.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=019903&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=019903&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
