It was a static script and nothing could stop the outcome. What would have been cool is if the players could have made a difference so the trolls would be in grobb on one server and the frogs in it on another. That kind of interactivity will never exist in EQ. I don't think that EQ2 is going to have dynamic events either. Things like the war in TM, or even Sleepers don't count because they players can't control those either. Wake the sleeper, and X happens, on every server without fail.<P>If you want a dynamic world, you are in the wrong game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

They are simply pointing out that there is no way you can convince a large enough portion of the EQ player population to give up the few hours a day/week/month/whatever to come do something that offers no real benefit to them. To make matters worse, even if by some quirk of fate or chance you DID manage to get that many people online at one time with that sole purpose in mind, it's only temporary. They will all have to log out eventually and things will continue unchanged. <P>You spoke about taking an active role in the development of the game. It's too late for that. SOE won't allow it. They have total control over what happens in this game and they will not allow the players to make arbitrary changes like that. The simple fact of the matter is the game is too old for something like that to happen. The code can't take it. Implementing dynamic, player controlled cities on all the servers was never a consideration for EQ, nor will it ever be. Would it be cool? Hell yeah! Would it be possible? Not really... no. Unfortunately not.<P>Now, a great many of the newer games have features like this. In SWG a town's alliance was decided based almost entirely on it's inhabitants. Of course, players can build and run their own cities there too, but the game was designed with that sort of interactivity in mind. EQ was not. The basic game structure won't support it.<P>So, we're not being jaded by saying it can't/won't/shouldn't be done. We're simply being realistic about the game's limitations and the company's motivations.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

After enouph time Sony might just give it back as it would be hard for someone to start a frog.[/quote]<P>Sounds fun as all heck, but sadly, based on previous dealings with Sony, they're more likely to simply patch the city one night and turn every frog into 65th level ubers capable of soloing The Sleeper in order to keep us players in line.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">I dont know if its because ive only been playing for 7 or 8 mos but you people are jaded as hell.

Additionally, Sony has also had a lousy record on following through on things - it's been nearly 6 months since the take over of Grobb and Sony has done exactly <B>nothing</B> to advance it so far.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">Here's the gist of that tirade,<BR>Nobody agrees with me so you're all suxor losers & nobody can have fun unless you do it exactly as I say.<P>If trolls had brains they'd be dangerous, looks like that one's almost there.</font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Sounds more like the jist is "this guy is some newb who doesn't know his place and actually thinks we can change the game - what a loser - let's call him a troll and a d00d and try to make him look stupid so that I can get back to leveling."<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">You spoke about taking an active role in the development of the game. It's too late for that. SOE won't allow it.</font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>This isn't entirely true - when certain player factions have made enough noise about certain changes, Sony has listened on occasion.  The idea of going into and retaking Grobb is basically the equivillent of a cyber sit in - flood the zone with players, kill as many NPCs as possible and do it for as long as possible to let Sony know that this is something that we care about.<P>There's actually nothing in the code to stop Sony from reacting to what players do - the code can easily handle a bunch of players going in and keeping every frog in Grobb dead and essentially staging a sit in.<P>Now, maybe Sony will chose to ignore us, but the reality is that they can't keep this behavior up forever - something is going to break and Sony will wake up one day to find that a good chunk of thier player base is gone - heck, just look at how many players they've lost to the crash to desktop bug they inflicted on us.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">Truth is that the troll population is the smallest of any of the races.

Sony decided they wanted to introduce a new race but they didnt want to spend the money to pay the team to make a new zone so they looked around at the player base and found trolls were the vast minority.

They invented a flimsy story line to cover their greedy manouvers.</font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>No, this was more lazy than greedy - with this move, all they had to do was shuffle around some NPCs and drop a couple of new textures into various places - if you move around Grobb just right, you can see the old textures under some of the changed areas.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">Sony is no different than any company.
