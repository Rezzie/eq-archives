I was fighting in Dulak last night.  I was soloing the warehouse when I notice off to the side another mage fighting mobs.  No biggie I thought.  A few minutes later this mage comes and sits right in my pull route without saying a word to me so I politely ask him to move and he does.  My pet is tanking away at the mob and I am answering something in guild chat.  When I look up there is the “other” mage’s pet attacking my mob.  I check my pet’s health and it is still well over 70% and the mob was now down to 30% so there was no reason for him to think that I was in any kind of trouble.<P>I ask him to pull his pet off please and yes I used the word “please”. I was very polite about it and he did. After the fight he sends me a tell and seems bent out of shape that I didn’t want his help.  I told him that I didn’t appreciate him sending in his pet since we weren’t grouped and he had said nothing to me since he got there.<P>He responded that he wasn’t trying to KS me since my pet had done over 51% damage and he didn’t understand why I was mad.  He stated that he had never had ANYONE turn down free DPS before. So at this point I con him and he is yellow to me.  I told him that I wasn’t mad, but that I wanted to fight my own battles.  I wasn’t looking for a group and didn’t want one that night.  He then turned and went back to killing his own mobs without saying a word.<P>Is this normal at higher levels?  I mean someone just comes up and starts wacking on a mob you are fighting after you have got it down to below 51% hps.  It really put me off.  It just seems really rude but I didn’t know if this is something that I should expect in the future.<P>Thanks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I'm surprised that, at his level (apparently higher than you), he couldn't look and see that you weren't in trouble, and neither was your pet (I presume), then determine whether or not his help was really needed.<P>I wonder if he was just after some easy way to get more faction, in trying to "tag" the mob.

Or, to keep from being bored.  Nearly always, they ask first (although the person they contact in my group doesn't always pass on the information).  Another possiblity is faction leeching.  None of those seem to be the case.  He was probably just bored.<P>Normally, I try to figure out what is going on before I ask people to back their pets off.

I had just spent 15 minutes kiting a red hill giant in the rathe mountains.  As soon as the HG starts to run, a red con player jumps in and helps me finish him off.  I send him a tell before he goes down saying, I can handle this myself, thanks.<P>He berates me, says I must be an idiot newbie to turn down the free help and that there was no way he could KS me because he had done more than 51% damage.  I reply that I had no idea what his class was, that it was certainly possible he could charm or mez the HG to wipe its memory banks so that he could get the kill.  He says I just don't understand, that a high level player would never do that, and then camps.  As if high level players are all perfect ladies and gentlemen.<P>I think any player that engages a mob is perfectly entitled, for any reason, to turn down "free" assistance.  There are a whole host of legitimate reasons why a player would want to solo a mob without anyone else jumping in.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I would have said the same thing. If I don't ask for help, don't give me help. If you one wants to work on melee skills, fine, just let me know beforehand. I do make an exception for archery. As long as they're not using Tureshot/EQ/AM3, they can fire their peashooters at will<P>Husker, you hit real close to home. Several months ago I had an elder panda (with claws in hand) in Stonebrunt KSed from me in this fashion. Had him down to 25%, feared and snared (so he wasn't moving), when a griefer lvl 55 bard came up, charmed him, hid to break charm, then chanted him to death and looted the claws. Although I was a 40ish ranger, my weaopns were marginal and there was no way I could compete with the DPS griefer was putting out. When I asked him (tactfully, but sternly) to justify his actions, he said, "Because I can kthxbye" and ran off. A quick conversation to his guild leader, explaining the situation (I had witnesses, which helped), and the griefer was disguilded before the end of the day.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Freeport.  There were a few other newbies there and we were all just whacking away at whatever wandered by us, leaving each other alone.  In comes this WE Ranger (lvl 10) and kills the large rat I was killing.  No biggie, thinking it's just a mistake or something.  Well, then he starts following me around, killing everything that I engage from a distance with his arrows.  At lvl 10, he's obviously not getting any xp from large rats and snakes and he never looted one thing that he killed.  I finally say "Was that necessary?" after he didn't even have the tact to KS out of my line of sight.  He moves on and starts griefing another newbie.  What would be the point in griefing in W Free?  Just grief for the sake of grief?<P>Villea<BR>Dark Elf Necromancer<BR>Spreading hate on Cazic-Thule for 9 seasons.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I don't know their level, I don't realize the mob is under 1/2 health(do they even know if I have damage shield on and didn't do all that damage myself? No.), and I don't know which one they are on if there are multiple mobs we are killing.  So, in a few seconds, I am supposed to know that you are there to help me, even if I don't really need help.

Then an oracle and a few more orcs aggroed him, so I tried to pull them off him but there were just too many of them.<P>He died, and I sent him a tell saying that I was sorry I couldn't have got them all off him. He replies very rudely and says it was my train. I point out I'm level 57, it wasn't my train and I was just trying to help him. He continued to be rude and act like an idiot.

Ever hear of staggering spawn times? Let's say you have 8 spawns on a 16 minute respawn. Each kill is 1 minute, leaving you 1 minute of med time before the next. If somebody comes up and just starts 'helping you out' for a few kills, than your entire system is thrown off. Suddenly you have a series of 4 or 5 mobs spawning very quickly, leaving you little med time. In fact, some might start spawning while you're in the middle of a fight, adding on and generally causing havoc. Again, not all help is wanted, because you might be doing something the other person hasn't even considered.<P>For the specific example - This other guy just moved in to your camp area, sat in the path of your pulls, and than sent in his pet without a word? Trust me, if that happened to me, the other guy would be getting a lot more than a polite word asking him to back off.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Either they are trying to help (ASK), or kill steal. If you want to skill up, ask first. If you want to 'help', then heal/buff the pet, bandage me if you are not a caster&lt;---thats 'help'. Don't touch the mobs unless you are asked for help.<P> Be carefull if someone seems to be sniping at your mobs more than once. They may be waiting for that time you are in trouble so they can grab a easy kill. If someones hanging around, wordless trying to take kills. Watch out cause sometimes they will try dumping mobs on you when you are fighting. If they train you, run off, loop around and gate behind them so the train goes back to mommy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Sure hope ya did not end up on his ignor list, especialy if he happens to have the only cleric alt in the area who could res you if needed later on.<P>Personlly when soloing I do not mind if someone want to help (by improving there wep skills, or getting faction). The only problem I ever had is the odd KS (when someone KS'ed me by mistake - but that's no biggy when its a honest mistake. Better a KS or a saved death and a new friend then making than being a jerk and making an enemey or someone that may not help you in the future when you are realy in need). - The breaking root thing can be a pain sometimes but just explaining that usally fixes the problem.<P>Persional, I would of invited the guy and formed a group. Together you would of gotten more exp (even if you both continued to solo) and if you desided to work together you would of gotten lots more exp and you both would of been safer. Not only that but it give you someone to talk to and maybe a new friend. <P>This is not a solo game guys, expect interaction. Also, sometimes help is given when not wanted but that sure beat no one giving any help.<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/wink.gif"> (65 mag, 62/56 druid, 54 nec, 53 war, ... newbies) </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

My character is a level 65 Monk on cazic Thule and I am guilty of the actions being questioned here. I have, on numerous occasions jumped in to help others finish off a mob that is more than half dead.<P>As I said I am 65... my weapon skills are maxed and thus there is no benefit to myself involved in these actions. I genuinely like to help people.<P>However, I had never even considered the fact that my help could be considered unwanted. I assumed I was saving them mana,time, etc. It didn't occur to me that I was taking away the players sense of accomplishment from a tough kill.<P>Well I knew there was a reason I read this board. Still learning here even at level 65. : )</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
