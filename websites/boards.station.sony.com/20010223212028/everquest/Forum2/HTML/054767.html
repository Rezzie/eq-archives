</FONT><HR>A while back i remeber seeing a post from a cleric that wasnt able to loot anything, and a bunch of ppl was giving them sudgestions on how to handle that problem.  Well, i dont think they are having that problem anymore, infact i think it is has gone the other way.  <P>clerics now EXPECT to get all the gems, in seb. that is pretty much the most common drop is the gems that the cheapest that sells for is 50 p, and them most that i had seen is a ring that sells for 150 p, I was grouped with a cleric that made 2 k in less then 4 hours from the gem drops, and she was expecting even more.  what am i to say, hmm no, i want it so i can pay for my stuff, and not get healed from her ( well she wasnt a very good cleric to begin with the necro and shaman was healing me more then her, and i died 4 times grouped with her)<P>I have a lvl 50 chanter, i can understand that clerics symbol componants cost them money, but my runes cost me money too, i pretty much have to but it on every fight, sometimes  more then once.<P>now what is a person to do? I would love to make some money too you know, instead of a few gold that i get from the split, i am running out of peridots. pretty soon i will not be able to put that on anymore, then what are the clerics to do?  they would have to heal me even more..  <P>like i said, i can understand there jems cost them a pretty penny, but gesh,  let other ppl have a gem or two out of every 4 you get.  and clerics have to remeber, enchanters mes and tas, is like an auto taunt, the mobs come strait at them if mes gets resisted or breaks. the mobs in seb dont hit very soft ether, they hit for the top i seen was 150 damage. <P>just my two cents.  not trying to hurt anyones feelings, but gesh, i would love to have some loot too </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If you have neccessary expenses to do your job properly in a group, you should ask for compensation just as clerics do. There's nothing greedy about it, it's just the cost of having these classes in a group. If a group wants to keep all their loot and not pay for gems, then they can do without clerics and enchanters, it's their right. If you don't want to pay for symbol, tell the cleric not to cast it. It is unreasonable to ask the cleric to cast symbol and eat the cost of peridots as well.<P>However, it's been my experience that in normal groups enchanters don't need to cast rune. Your mileage may vary.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>lol tired  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> 230 am here and was heading to bed, wanted to get my say out about the way clerics are now. this cleric i was grouped with had uber armor, better stuff then what my enchanter is using, and i am only a couple lvls below her. i spend all my money on peridots dont have much more for anything else unles i win a roll on a realy sweet item that i can sell for a couple k. but in seb. i havnt seen anything but spells and gems drop so far in the last 4 days. and this lady was literaly holding her hand out when ever someone looted a gem.<P>and she wasnt realy a good cleric ether, i had to ask for symbols 10 times before i got it.  i died 4 times.  the necro and shaman was healing me more then she was.<BR>and she was holding her hand out every time someone got a gem, what we going to say, well i would like to get some loot sometimes, then have her heal even less??  or not give us symbols at all??  she realy made over 2 k from the gems that she got just wile i was in that group, i make jewlery i know how much the stuff that was droping would sell to a vendor for, the cheapest would sell for 47 p and change, the most was a ring that sells for 150 p at vendor,  and this is seb i am talkin about, group would have to fight from zone in to there camp spot, half the mobs there see thru invis, the other half dont, it isnt like guk where u can put invis to undead in one spot and reg invis in anouther, or a walk a specal way to get past a mob with out gettin argoed.  cant just say, well i am not making any money in this group because the cleric is gettin it all, i am going to leave now.. and gate out and zone in and try for anouther group, and start all over again<P>i just had to get my two cents in.  the last 3 hours i was on my chanter in there i made more money then i did in the last 3 days because we didnt have a cleric and no one in my group wanted a cleric in the group because the clerics are wanting to much.  (btw i didnt die a single time in that 3 hours and we was pulling more then when i was grouped with a cleric)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ah well if you cleric sucks then there's not much you can do other than find a replacement. Personally, I give exact figures in pp as to how much it costs to replace the peridots I burned in the group. If you have a druid this is real convenient, just GG to a port with a vendor, use highest CHA charater to sell all sellables, give the cleric reimbursement first then split the rest.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Fact is Troller, gems are getting more and more wanted [especially for resist gear].  Diamonds especially.  Blue diamonds even more.  Other gems are also nice [black sapphires, etc.].  Handing them to clerics so they can sell them at a bazaar for 1-2k is more than covering for peridot cost.<P>I think clerics should ask that all gems be lottoed.  But they should ask for TRINKETS to cover peridot cost.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Many Clerics probably don't realize your expenditures since you are only casting Rune on yourself and maybe the puller.  Will the Rune using Jasper work nearly as well?  If so, you might try it.  That doesn't solve the problem you have though.<P>As a Cleric, I didn't realize the problems that Enchanters had until I went about estimating the costs of a raid into Chardok.  At that point, I did notice that Enchanters went through about twice as much or more in reagents than I did.  Afterwards, I made it a point to stop accepting gems in Sebilis after my expected costs in reagents was taken care of.  It was a real revelation.  The Enchanter went crazy on making sure all the corpses were looted.  It was like watching a starving kid in a candy store.  I say that not to deride Enchanters, but because I felt shamed in seeing how true what Fwen is saying about costs.  Make no mistake, Clerics need the cash too.  Our reputation is based on being generous with our reagents and in keeping our group members alive.  Often, I don't think the Enchanter really needs to be runed, but there is no predicting when that is true or not before the pull comes in.  I keep my Enchanters in my best Symbol spell because they do have an even higher taunt factor before they cast a spell than I do even, and tank worse than other casters (due to needing to watch Int, AC AND Cha).<P>You have my sympathies.  I would suggest you talk to your Clerics in tells.  Many of us are poor because we have been generous with our reagents, and appreciate a zone where we are kept beggared due to gems.  But the simple fact that we are beggared means we are used to being generous.  Be honest, and explain the situation, and avoid any Clerics that became Clerics to be an uber class and seek out the real Clerics that wanted to help people.  Don't assume the worst until you have talked to them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Uh... you shouldn't be using unbuyable gems (diamonds, black sapphire, jacinth) to cover symbol costs, you use things like sapphires, fire emeralds, fire opals, mithril amulets, etc. Rare gems are loot just like items are and should not be used for compensation.

</FONT><HR>Greedy people are a pain.<P>However, as a Dwarven Cleric, it costs me 12-15pp per peridot.  For a group of 6, for an hour I am spending 72-90pp.  That's if I have to symbol the whole group.<P>After everything is broken, I generally only symbol the puller and the chanter.  So I am spending 36-45 pp an hour.<P>Just take it into account.  If you are worried about overly greedy Clerics, bring some Peridots.  Anyone can buy them.<P>All melee chars should carry Peridots, and not just for Clerics.

Well if i had that many folk's dying id be looking at your puller chanter on whyn your having so much trouble.Most times in seb the cleric need's to stun so stuff dosent gate or CH.Having a shamen or druid for back up is sound and they should have to help out and heal.

Assuming no one leaves and is replaced, dies or is dispelled a Cleric should use 6 x 1/45 minutes x 60 minutes / hour x 4 hours = 32 for the group  At 10.5 platinum per, that comes out to 336 platinum.  Keep in mind that that isn't the only thing the gems go towards though.  We also have other places that we symbol in other than Sebilis.  We symbol in Fear (cash loot drops rarely and seems to vanish "somewhere"), we symbol everywhere.  Yes, Enchanter Rune everywhere too.  I do feel your pain at being one of Verant's designated cash sinks when EVERYONE should be cash sinks instead of just a few.  It is frustrating to have everyone tell you how uber your class is, and how easy you have it when you deal with high stress in the group and high stress going to the gem merchants.<P>I wish Verant would come up with new cash sinks and remove the reagent costs of just plain grouping.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>TiredBattered, What Fwen is saying is that Enchanters are Runing themselves.  They don't Rune the entire group.  The have to Rune themselves to take that initial rush until things are under control.  If you have ever seen a mob beating on an Enchanter and the Enchanter not taking damage, that is the Enchanter's Rune getting knocked off.  That is an excellent time to cast Stun on the mob (not Holy Might, but that is another discussion).  If you think about how often a lot of Enchanters are being trained by the puller, and consider the price of each pull being 10.5 platinum, that adds up fast.  Faster than 10.5 platinum per replaced group member, death, dispell or refresh even.<P>Enchanters are our best friends as Clerics.  When a major pull comes in and we are chain healing the puller and end up tanking everything except that one mob the tanks are on, it is the Enchanter that saves our non-tanking butts.  I consider this an important thread so that Clerics and Enchanters can get their heads together and come up with an arrangement that is equally painful (it won't ever not be painful and still be fair).  The trick is to make the pain bearable by both classes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Yup, just make sure the costs of symbols get covered and I'll be happy.  Just realize it is often 36p an hour that we are spending if we are symboling 3 people.  I didn't realize it until recently, but fire opals are only worth 40p.  A lot of the gems I thought were worth more are kind of disappointing.<P>However, I was on a raid where the clerics expected to get the diamonds and I wasn't necessarily crazy about that idea, even though I benefited from it. <P>But then again, I've been on raids and what not where we didn't get a thing and spent 100's in symbol agents.  Yes, sometimes it works out more in our favor, other times we take a huge loss.<P>I agree with the idea of keep track of all the symbols you cast and asking the group to reimburse you.  When I lead raids, if the clerics don't get anything, I ask the party members to make donations to cover their costs.  Of course, I noticed only 2 people out of 18 actually did...<P>But I will be more sensitive to enchanters costs in the future.  My perception was that they only rune themselves, like wizards do.  So their costs were pretty minimal. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hmmm<P>When in seb, normal practice for my groups is to give me the first 4 non rare gems, this (barely) covers the evening's symbol costs.  <P>Buying from fv (apprehensive to them), 12pp 5 gold per Peridot, allowing for dispells 8 peridots per hour, so 8 X 12.5 = 100pp per hour.

This saves me having to run or get a gate to a city so I can replenish supplies.  For some reason people dislike carrying peridots around with them, they expect the cleric / enchanter to always have them.....<P>So my advice to all you non clerics, carry peridots, give your cleric 1 peridot per naltron / marzin (unless is Naltron's Mark) then no one needs to be greedy over looting jewels.<P>Regards</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As a enchanter, I burn probably 200-300pp in peridots for a marathon session(6-8 hours).  Rune 5 is the only way to go and that costs 10.5pp per cast.  I get lucky on a few randoms(except for things I really need lol) so I usually cover my expenses.<P>Personally I am all for giving the clerics ALL the gems.  They may take in more cash than they spend on that one group, but you need to consider the times when the cleric is on a planar raid or other multigroup raid.  They usually dont get gems there and symbol expenses come out of pocket.  There are exceptions to the rule like grouping with the cleric that wants 200pp to res you at the zone line =)  He doesnt get many gems(and not many groups with me either).<P>I also believe its bad form not to symbol everyone in the group.  Sure there are many times you probably dont need it, but it sure comes in handy when something goes wrong and people need all the hitpoints they can get(clerics or chanters going LD, for example).<P>Its a small price to pay for insuring your group's health thus keeping downtime and corpse recoveries to a minumum.<P>Devnor Dei'Vernula<BR>57 Enchanter<BR>Terris Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You get upset about that Cleric making 2k or whatever it was in 4 hours.<P>I'll tell you this. Once I went on a Plane of Sky raid, was there for a few days, NO GEMS DROPED<P>I burned 4 stacks of peridots maybe 5 I cant remember.<P>Now here I am, say 5 stacks of peridots short and nothing to sell to make that money back.<P>You know, I dont really care, because I'll go somewhere that drops gems and make that plat up.<P>So who is to say that Cleric has never spent a weekend raiding in cost of say 2k on peridots.<P>There isnt alot of tanks or anyone willing to donate money to Clerics, sure there is some but not very many.<P>As for the Chanter useing peridots, How often to you cast Rune on EVERYONE in your group? Im not doubting you have done it at some point but Im sure you dont do it every time.<P>As for my Symbol, When Im in a group everyone in group gets it, especially the Enchanter.<P>Well I think my point was made.<P>God's Speed Folks<P>Hextorn<BR>54th Vicar of Xegony<BR>Dragon's Claw<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You need to change you post title - you are talking about one greedy cleric - please don't paint us all with the same brush.  Some nights I am able to get some decent loot to cover my peridot cost, other nights I'm not.  Most of the time, I take a plat loss on the cost of casting symbols.  <P>It sounds to me like your group was the problem. Why did they keep giving the cleric the gems?  Why didn't you say something?  Why didn't you leave if they were not being fair?  From my take of what you said, the group was not distributing loot fairly and that was the core of the problem - not the cleric who felt she "deserved" more. Although her attitude would bother me greatly - as it obviously did you.<P>Again though - don't paint all clerics with one brush.  The cleric bashing on this board is WAY out of hand (as is the Druid bashing).  So complain about the problem person if you will, but for many of us clerics who scrape and save to afford the high price of our dropped spells and the high price of symbols - your post does not apply.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Please do not let one bad experience with a cleric ruin your impressions of a cleric.  I for one will NEVER asksomeone to pay for a res, and even if I am to go out of my way to res someone I wll still usally not take a donation.  <P>With that, I also do NOT expect the gems in Sebilis and I have NEVER made 2k worth of gems in even 4 hours of playing in Seb.  I was in King last night for about 4 hours and I did get 5 gems total that helped me replenise the 34 peridots I was lacking.  With a CHA buff and a couple of other +CHA items, they each cost me 10p 5g ... <P>Sorry for the rant, I try my best to not let my group members die to the best of my ability.  Lie I said, I was in the King room last night in Sebilis and for the entire time we were there, not one person died, and we were only a group of 6 total.<P>If your wondering, my armor is nothing more then EM from Hate with only 1 or 2 nice pieces because I won them on a fair roll that everyone in the group rolled on from earlier adventering expaditions.<P>Java - the cute furry footed cleric of 57</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OMG.  Clerics whining about money.  If a cleric went to any kunark zone and offered a rez for 25p which is WAY lower than ive ever been charged.. they would be stacked with cash.  I cant believe this topic is even being brought up.  Next your gonna tell me druids cant make money either....<P>     Here's an idea... just go stand at the zone line in mm or lguk for one night... then retire!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/054767-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/054767-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/054767-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=054767&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=054767&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
