This itself isn't shocking, but how they do it is... to me atleast.<P>Recently, we've heard alot from especially Paladins, Warriors, Mages, and Bards.  All of which think defending against a nerf means they have to convince the EQ Community how much they suck?  Why do they think this works?<P>I have seen blatant lies, people saying stuff like Shamans will now do more damage versus Mages?  Should I take that in stride and tell everyone... Hey, I can outdamage mages, pick me for your dps slots!.. when I know they're flat out lying?  Thanks for trying to increase the popularity of my class, too bad you didn't do anything but reduce the popularity of yours.<P>Monks whined alot when they got nerfed... see how popular they are today.  Warriors complain so much about aggro, they don't get groups anymore.  Paladins/Mages/Bards have tried to do the same recently, and it just leaves me wondering... why do you folks try to convince the EQ Community of how much you suck?  Tell people you're worthless, they're gonna believe it with or without a nerf, and they're not going to blame the nerf for it... they're going to blame the class as a whole.<P>This is a very bad tactic, one that makes me very angry because I have friends who play every class and everytime someone pipes off with a lie or deception or anything like that, you're really just trying to tear down your entire class because you don't like a nerf.  You guys aren't doing yourselves any favors.  The only minds you are changing are those of the players that are going to believe you and label you amongst the "useless" classes.<P>I know a few Shamans who got upset about Beastlords having such nice slow AND good dps at 65.  This doesn't concern me, in fact, I take it in stride... "Yeah, well I do alot more for the group 1-64 than a Beastlord ever will." is my stance on it, a positive look that will actually make people pick me or others who play my class... not stay away from me.<P>So, the next time you hear about a nerf, concentrate on the positive even after that... Don't try to convince everyone you suck, it isn't going to erase a nerf from happening, it is just going to make players avoid ever accepting you, and those who play your class, into groups</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I got SICK and TIRED of nerfs. I got sick and tired of game is to easy, sick and tired of all of it. I was worn out over be good do A get B. Then oh well you did A now you get F. Have a nice day! <P>I only really came into EQ for 1 reason, I figured they had there s*** together by the beginning of 2003. Yes, and no, I guess. However to this day, I have friends that won't touch a online game period because of all the BS that goes with it. <P>I sense if you put time into something, and SOE spends years going ok let's fix it now, then you are getting the do A, get B, here is F treatment. And that royally PO's off people and for good reason. Just a different view I guess.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Remember, a small portion of the player base is being represented here.  This small portion of the player base will always complain about anything.  They donot represent the player base as a whole.<P>Now when SOE respondes and makes changes (like the upcoming melee changes) they are responding to the larger player base as a whole.  It took a whole lot of collective warriors to complain over a long time that their usefulness was being reduced.  SOE parsed the number of players consistantly out there and found a hugh disparity between Warriors and their Hybrid classes.  Rogues and Monks I feel, but cannot verify as my opinion is mine alone and not representative of the player base as a whole, are benefitting by being pure melee.<P>These changes are intended to increase the playability of pure melee classes with warriors being a focus.  (Again my opinion).  Being a monk the only disadvantage to date I see is the uselessness of most of the disciplines (due to the re-use times).<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">Monks whined alot when they got nerfed... see how popular they are today.</font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>Again, when this bat was swung it was swung too hard.

They parsed the data and showed SOE the overall effects of being dropped from the plate mitigating table to the cloth mitigation table (or something to that effect).  SOE did their own research and agreed that they hurt the class when their intent was to balence the class.  Moving them up to the leather or chain mitigation table was the fix and better solution to balence (in this case) an overpowered class.<P>Yes, we monks were over-powered.  Nobody should ever be a better tank than a warrior when all things are equal (level, gear, player ability).<P>Yes folks whined, but please do not consider the few whiners as the thoughts of the community as a whole.  When the community as a whole speaks, that is when SOE responds.  After all, they are a buisness and keeping the majority of the players playing is their goal.<P>Catering to a vocal few who complain that the sun is to bright when it rises and it is too dark when it sets is not in thier best interest.  Though allowing them to complain about the sun is, hence you have boards such as this that allow for an outlet.<P>Baron Skrax Swifttail<BR>Grandmaster on Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I and most other mages are complaining that canni-pet does not make us overbalanced, so why nerf it?  Some mages have a major investment in time and effort to get the AA's, specialization, and equipment to make it work optimally.  The AA SoE just announced they are refunding proves they don't even understand canni pet!  <P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">Monks whined alot when they got nerfed... see how popular they are today.</font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>You imply their popularity fell because they whined.  No, it fell because of the nerf.  Note that Lull is the prefered pulling method now, so few people even need a monk in their group.  I often joined groups with monks pre-nerf, now I see them in groups much less.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">Warriors complain so much about aggro, they don't get groups anymore.</font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>Again you imply whining is the issue.  Warriors began having trouble getting into groups and especially raids as people switched to prefering other tank classes that can hold agro better and mitigate damage almost as well.<P>Paladins were having a heck of a time getting groups about a year ago.  Not because they whined, but because they got no respect for their DPS or tanking abilities.<P>Paladins and soon (we hope) warriors got some relief from their balance issues.  But this was a very long time in coming.  But eventually it got addressed.  <P>When a class sees itself moving to the bottom of the list in usefulness, of course they are going to complain.  With the leadtime we get on responses, we have to respond loud and early to what we believe to be overly negative changes.  <P>Shaman are one of the most desired classes in the game right now.  So I am not surprised you see no problem here.  <P>So before you make us all sick with your "look on the bright side" comments, take a closer look.  What is the longest you've ever gone LFG?  How many uncrowded places have you got for effective soloing?  How often are you turned down by groups or raids while they hold spots open for more optimal classes? <P>What is motivating you to speak on these issues anyway?  Are you hoping for some brownie points with the developers because you are sticking up for their ill considered changes?  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=055010&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=055010&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
