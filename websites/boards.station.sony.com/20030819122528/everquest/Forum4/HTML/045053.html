I do this not to continue to bug you about stuff but because you have helped me with something I must have needed help with.  It is my way of saying thanks.  Reality a newbie (1-5 level) has nothing someone of level (10-+++) would need.  Not copper, not gold surely not plat.

I have to believe it is the same for them outside the game. polite in real life-polite in game. even if you are new and playing a necro you don't really know how to roleplay right from the beginning(if you are a true newb).i think if you're naturally polite in RL it will come as second nature in game.syas alot about the state of things i think.and how many polite people do you actually see on the street anyway these days? walk down the street and count how many people smile or say hello or even just look you in the eye. these are different times my friends.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

They have so far, been a joy to find. I'm not real accustomed to online play, well not like this anyway. Most of the games I played were shooters and I do still play MCO, until it shuts down anyway. This place you have here, is FANTASTIC. <BR>    <BR>   I have met folks here that I'd actually like to by a pitcher for, and just sit down and gab  for awhile. I don't think my wife or I have ever asked for anything except information, and when you ask for that, I've found it best to be ready for a ton of information! <BR>   I was down in BlackBurrow, fighting my tail off, and some nice fella asks why it's taking me so long to level. I thought he was going to be rude, but then, my thinking is also why I'm not working at NASA. Anyway, the two of us are talking, he asked to look at my stuff. After his viewing, this guy bring 2 other characters all the way out to BlackBurrow to hand me some of his old stuff, which to me, is a godsend.<BR>    <BR>   He wouldn't take anything for it, just asked that I pass on the kindness. I'm certainly not saying I haven't run into a few "Richard Noggins", there's plenty of them. Maybe the reason why you older players don't see the nice guys anymore, is because you've made it far past the point of needing anything they can do for you. I know the wads are out there, but I'm not sure they have what it takes to stick it out on a game like this. It's not like they are getting positive responces from the folks they make angry. Besides, it's human nature to remember more of who made us angry, rather than who made us happy. I remember the name of the guy that tripped me on the playground, but not the name of the kid that helped me up. Ok, done babbling now.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The vast majority of people I meet and help (asked or volunteered) seem incapable of expressing any sort of appreciation; it's as though whatever cut-throat games they come from have drained the ability right out of them.  Either that, or when they do realize that you are trying to help, they suddenly (and for days afterwards) bombard you with every question they can think of and every request for money and equipment that crosses their minds.  As another vetran player recently said to me when I replied to an /ooc asking for help, "You're braver than I am--I never reply to requests for help, it always leads to a ton of parasites following me around for days."<P>Another form of "newb" I'm seeing more of is the Killer Newb from Hades, who has just enough of a handle on the game to be convinced that he is doing everything right, regardless of results.  While running one of my lowbies on Stromm I was grouped with a bunch consisting of 2 clueless newbs and 1 KNFH.  After suffering numerous unneeded trains in BB (how in the gods name to you train a horde of patrollers UP from the snake ledge when, presumably, you never left it but were innocently waiting for a pull?) I made a few suggestions.  The clueless newbs said nothing, the KNFH instantly jumped on me about my "attitiude" and accused me of thinking they were all newbs and didn't know how to play.<P>Having had a snootful of this crew, I agreed that they were, they didn't, I did, and then disbanded.  The KNFH proceeded to send a slew of obnoxious tells; I made no reply and eventually /ignored him.  The only thing impressive about the whole encounter was that at least one of them had figured out how to send /tells.<P>That attitude seems to be growing, slowly but steadily.  Kindly meant advice is responded to instantly and aggressively with mild-to-major abuse, as though this were not just a game but instead a colossal pissing match where you can't for a minute let anyone else think you aren't in complete control.<P>So, for those who still want to help the newbs, do--many of them are worth the effort and make a fine addition to the friend list.  But be aware that there are now cleverly disguised newb-shaped land-mines waiting for you, and don't be surprised when one occasionally blows up in your face.<P>To those who berate the vetrans for scorning the newbs, keep firmly in mind that (aside from the occasional case of actual rampant egotism) the majority of vets have that scorn because the newbs they encounter inspire it.  Polite newbs = happy vetrans.  It's a simple equation.<P>Also, to any newbs who are reading this post, go back and read it again--and notice how many people who replied here don't want your money or your loot, just a polite request followed by a polite thanks.<P>Llanwe na Finn<BR>Druid, Daughter of Tunare<BR>May She be with you in all of the dark places where you must walk.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Who I guess are society's newbs. Anyway a month or so ago when I was in DSP (a guildmate asked me to join is group). When the leader of the group, also my guildmate, stepped out for a second, she made me leader despite the other four people that had been there. One of them in particular started to give me a nasty attidude. I could understand the others being kinda mad, because I would've been. But this one guy wouldn't stop. It progressed to the level of insults soon, and thats when the stupidest thing I've ever seen someone in EQ do happened: He trained his own group. Not only did he announce it, but he visibly ran around the whole camp picking up aggro on everything. By this point the group leader was back, so he should'nt of been so angry by that point. But it didnt even stop by then! Soon after that I started getting tells often enough to be considered spamming about how I was a newb and all that. Then he brought in some outside friend to comense spamming too!<P>I know this was kind of off subject, but I just had to mention it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

In retrospect, he must have been a shaman, because after telling me where to go, he buffed me up.  Now, buffs weren't covered in the tutorial, all I knew was that he was casting spells, and a bunch of little icons were popping up in my window.  I doubt I ever thanked him, because I hadn't a clue what was going on.  I did click on one of the icons to see what happened, and it went away.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>As for the guy in the first story, if he's lev 10, that was probably his first CR -- every time previous, he popped at his bind point fully equipped.  And all the silence from him strongly indicates to me that he didn't know what the hell you were talking about.  Same thing goes for a lot of game concepts that you and I know as second nature: a buff, a rez, a port, a summon, these are all things that are completely alien to a newbie.  It took me until a good lev 20 until I discovered that there were ways to travel other than just hoofin' it.  (This was after Luclin, before PoP.)<P>I do like the "a building and some trees" part, though.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Just because a few bad apples are out there, it does not mean there is not a peach in the bunch.  Sometimes you have to weed out the rotten core that exists to get to the real fruit.  People can just as easily get frustrated with 'veteran' players.  Everybody has a few spots.  Just remember that and treat each other civil, even if they do crawl under your skin sometimes.  It might surprise you sometime if you return fresh water to someone who has only given you vingar to drink.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I just started playing EQ back in november of last year and before I logged on for the first time I actually READ THE HANDBOOK! LOL.  I logged in for the first time knowing how to /ooc, /loc, /tell, and most of the other really basic stuff.  However, I was completely overwhelmed by the complexity of the game and needed a lot of guidance.  I play on the Luclin server and what I found was that 90% of the time people were willing to help me find the bank, find the zone line, etc.. etc.. simple stuff like that.  I never once begged for plat or items and I didnt have to.  It wasnt uncommon at all to be killing gopher snakes in qeynos and have someone run up and after inspecting me, hand me some really cool gear or weapon.  I ALWAYS tried to give them whatever money I had, it was ALWAYS refused and I would thank them profusely.  I remembered that kind of stuff and now I go out of my way to help people that are obviously new to the game.  I do have a problem with the rude people and the beggars though, that kinda ticks me off.  When someone just walks up and says "can I have some plat?" grrrr... I usually respond with "Sure, anyone can and I dont think theres a limit but if you have too much you can get encumbered so be careful.  Good luck to you!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"> Hehe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

And some new to class.  Ran into a 25 bard who immediately wanted to borrow a weapon and my ivory horn.  Hmmmm...after realizing he had NO weapon (said he'd deleted his upgrade stuff) I loaned him my spear.  Didn't seem to know how to twist.  Wanted to tackle ice giants in EF.  So we did.  Bad, bad idea.  But he had a 53 cleric so I think he was just trying out bards to see if he'd like em or not.<P>Most true newbies I've come across are almost apologetic about asking for help.  I really have no problem with newbies who are just learning.  I don't much care for newbies who don't know and won't learn or who are petulant.  Am suspicious of beggers or other players "borrowing" my stuff (see above).  Last night the guy was jake so it worked out but I'm still untrusting about such.<P>I received a lot of help starting out so I don't mind helping newbies.  Also, it's kinda fun usually.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

And I do have a few questions.  Big surprise.<P>I have to say this bit about politness should be standard.  But I also think that you can be clueless as to what is happening.  Case in point, first time I was "buffed", some guy gave me SoW on my Northman Warrior and I had no Idea what was going on.  I was sure I was going to die.  Then he ran off.  So I had no time to thank him.<P>Another thing I want to talk about is how this game is supposedly not as good as it was. Have you played DII in the last 6 months? God help you if you have.  People are saints here compared to there.<P>Also, I had some guy once show me where the bank was in Qeynos once I found out I could transfer from my Warrior to my Ranger.  Also had people save my behind on occasion, though usually I'll run to the town guards.<P>The good thing about me is I abhor freeloaders, seen enough of those in DII for about 8 lifetimes.  So here I tend to just run out and pick a fight with that large rat over there, then die. Then do it again.  Right now I have a lvl 6 Warrior Northman and a lvl 5 Rogue Hafling. And I've only been playing for about 2 weeks on and off.  I play on the <BR>Maelin Starpyre Server as this had the most people when I first signed in.<P>Now my questions, which you can feel free to ignore.<BR>-I know you can transfer items between chars but can you do cash as well?<BR>-figured out how to fletch, but I can't seem to forge the Rogue quest armor.<BR>-What use does begging have? [apart form sounding really sad?]<BR>-anything else you think I - or another snow-white newb - ought to know.<P>As always, I give thanks and credit where possible.  And I look forward to helping others as I have been helped.<P>PS  I know my name is spelled wrong ... damn typo, lol.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

We got in the game and spent half our time trying to do stuff and the other half trying to read the worthless manual.  Not to mention arguing with each other about what we just did.  Our native tongue is English (no comments, please).  I can't imagine how it would be if we had to have a dictionary handy to be able to able to communicate.<P>I can just imagine the player to be looking at the manual, looking at a dictionary, discussing with friends, and not being quick responding.  Remember that in real life, a large part of communication is nonverbal -- which you don't get in EQ.<P>Just tonight, I got a /tell from some lvl 17 druid asking about the druid port spells (I was on my druid at the time).  I tell him where they are found and say I was hunting with my guild in Umbral Plains and not able to help.  He said that was OK, he would wait.<P>Three hours later, he is lvl 18 and we finally break up.  I port him from GFay to WC.  Of course, the vendor is missing, so I petition.  Eventually, the vendor is put back, he gets his spell, and I buff him up (losing an hour to what should have been 5 minutes, max).  Half the time, when I said something, it took about 2 minutes to get a response.  I could imagine him looking stuff up, or just overwhelmed.<P>He did thank me in the end, but that was icing.  Even though I have played EQ for years, I still remember my first week.  I know how overwhelming it can be for a newbie.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/045053-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/045053-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=045053&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=045053&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
