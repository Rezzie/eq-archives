</FONT><HR>xean, clerics dont want to see anyone nerfed.  It is just the furstrated ones that dont know how to unleash their frustration towards the real evil that call for nerfs to other classes.  Take their comments with a grain of salt and dont pay them any mind.  This is something that all classes do when frustrated, and as illogical as it is, its something that should be ignored.  Imagine how you would feel when you've been nerfed 3 times with huge nerfs in 1 week.<P>Verant has done as good a job as anyone possible could to alienate and piss off the playerbase whom they claim to be doing this for.  ****ing morons.  <P>I really do hope that Furor and FoH dont quit over this.  Were i them, with all their top notch resources, id continue to beat and give 110% effort to making a mockery of encounters, keeping screenshots and logs, and sending them to verant to show them that they ARE superior to them when it comes to this game.  Get Verant to continue to nerf every thing to make their lives more difficult, and have players gradually quit because of it.  ****ing up their revenue is about as good a way to get back at them as any for their petty, bitter dungeon master syndrome.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Even after all the feedback that verant has gotten in the past week or whatever about this change that is coming up, they still wont have any regret, because there plan has worked, and that was to nerf the hate agro for clerics, then to nerf the cleric bp's, then change back the hate while still maintaining the bp changes, insisting that the bp changes are unbalancing the high end game.  Even with all the arguments being states, which are very convincing, but it seems that NO ONE on the verant staff is part of an 'uberguild' and dont know truly how the game works.  IF they did, they would know that the pog cleric bp is mainly good for downtime and normal fights.  Fighting a mob that quads for 500-800 like velketor, lord doljo, derakor the vindicator, mainy more out there that im sure guilds have fought and have had a chance with their equipment that they have worked their asses off for, i know i have for the past 2 years.  But with verant's recent decisions there is absolutely no reason for the people that have been playing this game for 2 years and part of the top percentage in uberguilds to stay with this game when they aren't having fun anymore.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't play a cleric, bit I would ask to please stop nerfing them.  Clerics sacrifice more than anyone else in the game, and for that alone they SHOULD be the least nerfed class.  For a game that supposedly encourages grouping, I really don't see why you keep nerfing the most group oriented class in the game.  And you also might want to think about what people do at higher levels.. as someone said before.  You collect toys and maybe hop on and ubermob raid.  You take the toys away, then make ubermob raids nearly impossible with the hate issue.  I mean the point of the game is to be fun after all, and while it is supposed to be challenging, it has to keep your interest at the same time.  This is a GAME, and when the fun gets snuffed out because of frustration, there really isn't anything left.<P>I've started to wonder if Verant is so concerned with druids because the cleric class will soon be virtually extinct.<P>Question is, will I even want to play EQ once there are no more clerics in the game?  Maybe, but it will certainly take a lot of the fun out of EQ.  Clerics are cool to partner with since most of them are rather talkative (always meditating and all).  Clerics make groups much better, and fun to be in since they group is generally healthy with a cleric.  If suddenly clerics were extremely fun to play, and 25% of the players were clerics, would this be a bad thing?  You'd probably just have more grouping if anything.  From what I've seen, clerics are already sort of rare.<P>I still believe clerics should be compensated (although still not enough for their sacrifices) by removing the spellbook at level 15 or lower.  As a class that is practically defined by sitting around, you should at least make the effort to make it more fun for them.<P>Other online RPG's are coming out soon Verant.  The clock is ticking.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Verant.  You guys could just make the spell a high agro version of celestial elixer.  Like Nerfed Elixer or something.  This way a mob would be stuck on the cleric so the cleric couldn't keep clicking.  The cleric would have to take cover or only heal when people are close to dying.<P>Personally I don't understand why there is anything wrong with mobs getting really pissed off at clerics for healing their group.  If I saw a mob keep their friends alive when I was trying to kill them, I'd go berserk.<P>Lets compare here:<BR>Mobs when they are not in a fight regenerate about 2% hps and mana a tick.<BR>Players regenerate about 0.005% hps and 0.01% mana a tick when not in a fight.  That's f**ked up dood.<P>Mobs lvl 60 hit for about 500 a round if they are int casters, and for about 1200 if they are brutish type mobs like dragons.<BR>Lvl 60 pc int casters melee for maybe 40 damage, and brutish classes melee for about 300 damage a round.<P>If 6 lvl 60 mobs consisting of 2 warriors, a druid, a cleric, a wizard, and an enchanter rolled thru sebilis they could solo trakanon.<BR>If 6 lvl 60 players tried that, they would have 6 corpses.<P>Mobs basically have to get casted upon to get interrupted when they are casting spells.<BR>Players basically have to root themselves and slow the mobs to get spells cast if a mob is agrod on them.<P>Single mobs have about 40 seconds of total downtime after they kill a player.<BR>Players have about 10 minutes of total downtime after they kill a single mob.<P>A lvl 60 mob can kill a lvl 59 mob in most cases.<BR>A lvl 60 player can't even feign death if a 59 mob is on them.<P>A company named Verant keeps pissing off their customers nerfing 5% of the players every time people start having a good time.<BR>A mob of players switch to a different game or stop playing roleplaying games at all.<P>Swear to god if I played a cleric that had one of those breastplates, I'd quit.

</FONT><HR>The problem here isn't that you're nerfing the breastplate.  I completely agree that it needs to be done.  The real problem is that you didn't THINK to test this item before making it.  How rigorous of a testing period could it have undergone?  It doesn't take a genious to figure out that you can chain cast the heals and heal any player for 300hps per 6 seconds.  Hence if a monster can't do over 300hps per 6 seconds the player can stay infinitely healed.  In the future if you want to avoid such issues, please better test your high-end items and think before putting them into the game.  Even though this problem should never have arisen, I agree that you need to remove this item because it NEVER should have been made in the first place.  Thats my feeling on this topic.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>hmmm, been well over 12 hours since I last posted, I have still not heard word one about what the new bp will be like, and SPECIFICS on the changes to hate.<P>As for complaining about other classes like druids, I agree with a previous poster, it is only becuase the  clerics are mad, we don't want them nerfed either.<P>As for wanting my PoG faction changes fixed, heck ya.  First, only reason I lost the faction was cause I was a cleric to begin with.  God's forgive me for accually healing somebody (I'm such a terrible person).  Without me, 24 people would have lost their xp resses and maybe even their gear.  As it stood, only 2 folks did not get xp resses and I (yes I) was one of them, cause I allways res myself last.  Then I figured "well, if that B***** Tunare wants to get her undies in a pinch about this FINE, I want some armor out of it."  I'm a dwarf, it is my nature to be blunt  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>I got my PoG legs, good only for downtimes and kind of fun to throw on a group of newbies when I group them to give a group hero.  I wanted that bp so bad, it more even then my Epic in some ways.  Mainly for the AC but the effect, the cuts to downtime would have been heaven sent, now, it is a waste for that purpose, only good thing about it now is the AC and stats, but Donals is better for that now isn't it?<P>Fenra of Misty<BR>55 Templar of Test</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have always felt like I was getting the shaft in EQ. Why is that? I think it is because I havent played a druid. I wonder if Verant understands that most people play EQ despite the fact that there game leaves you feeling sick to the stomache. Your game engine is ingenious! That is why people love and continue to play EQ. <P>I think the one thing you failed to do right from the beginning was to BALANCE the classes... but not only that. YOu forgot to balance the amount of FUN each class would bring. Perhaps you got it right the first time when you created your version of the Druid, and just decided to make every other class a pain to play.   <P>After 29 levels as a warrior, and 45 levels as a cleric i finally get it. Verant really does want everyone to be a druid. <P>You have sistamaticly sucked all the fun out of the game for me, not that sitting on my arse all night was that much of a joy anyway. At least I could DO something for someone else. Playing a warrior I always felt like a 2 year old who couldn't even tie his own shoes. <P>My server is so swamped with twinks and uber loot now i hardly see what the point is any more. <P>One dissatisfied Warrior and Cleric</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Verant uses these boards as public relations, saying they give the consumer an outlet for responding to the game.<P>tell me when the last time they made a change cause someone posted they didn't like it?<P>the ranger stuff can't be counted cause they claim it as their idea to drop xp penalty.  And i think maybe 4 out of around 100 posts asked for sow at a lower level, and they gave that.  I know that makes our lives easier but we all asked for better archery.  ***?<P>They don't care, either play with all this change for the hell of it ideas or play another game.

</FONT><HR>Pls excuse the name, old Quake name that somewhat stuck. Anyway, I no longer play EQ,haven't for about 5 months,have kept the account active for perhaps no other reason then nostalgia/addiction, and come to the boards to read occasionally. I generally read the boards to supress my need for MMORPGs. From week to week I read about more and more people leaving, and people getting disgusted and promising that this will be the downfall of Verant. Honestly though, everyday more and more people join up, more and more keep playing, even though they want to stop, and this is now a 30 million dollar a year business. Granted much of that goes to salaries, server costs, etc, but don't for a minute think that Verant is not meeting and surpassing all of it's quotas. I myself had hours and days on end of fun and enjoyment, but finally couldn't stand the constant interruptions to my fun. I applaud Verant for their initial incarnation. The beautiful textures, the little nuances of the cities, the first encounters with a spiderling, the deadly encounters with my first dragon. From my first days as a lvl 1 with no experience, to my finals days around lvl 53,(give or take a death), I had a great deal of fun. Unfortunately, I began questioning why I played. When it finally came down to it, other then the friends(online friends), I really had no reason to stay. I just wasn't having fun anymore. Too many daunting changes, nerfs if you will, too many bugs, my corpse dissappearing, days spent after a patch with no items, etc, etc. When the final day I was online came about I sat there, clicking, and said to myself "I'm not having fun.", logged off, and that was the end of my character's inside the game. My lvl 53 shaman gone, my lvl 48 necro gone, my lvl 35 druid gone, my other lvl 30 necro(iksar for a change from my DE), my countless players scattered across carebear and pk servers....In the end, I thankyou Verant, and I applaud you. But to those who constantly say they are disgusted, or tired, or won't take it anymore...I ask you "Why do you play? When the chips are down, the dragons are dead, and the gods have all fallen, are you really having fun anymore?" .....Anyway, Thanks for listening to my thoughts if you took the time to read them, and thanks to Verant for my initial enjoyment, and thanks to all my friends I met along the way. I'm gonna go grab a coke and look around for new lands to walk, hopefully I'll see some of you in our world, not theirs. <P><BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I feel that everyone here is overreacting over 2 breatsplates.  we clerics still have the best heals by far.  At uber levels we are neccessary for any group with more than 2 poeple, i.e. we are groups.  Also Verant said they made uber-mobs with the bp's in mind, made them very hard that is, and if they nerfed the bp's, they would change the mobs, so to follow up they should make the mobs weaker.  If the mobs are weaker, we wont need the bp's and we will still be the best healers, as long as verant follows up with weakening the mobs, i feel this is a fair nerf.  Also they should restore the faction in growth, mine sux now.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I doubt this will be read since this thread is so deep, but here's my opinion.<P>1)Verant really needs to stop nerfing items and characters in the game.  <P>Not all players are power gamers able to conquer new areas and mobs within weeks of being rolled out.  Items like the Trak Cleric BP and the POG Cleric BP were obtained through carefully planning and hard work by many of the clerics wearing them.  To continually change them and nerf them is just wrong.  <P>In addition, players should not have to deal with changing game dynamics like different hate list rules.  Players have spent months learning the game dynamics and adjusting their raids and tactics accordingly.  Changing the hate agro rules at this point essentially throws away much of those player's knowledge and research.<P>2)Verant should concentrate on fixing game bugs and providing better customer service.<P>Many game bugs, especially ones regarding epic quests, exist in the game and need to be fixed.  Players spend a great deal of time and energy attempting to do quests which sometimes fail to work properly due to some bug.  In addition certain zones cause frame rate bugs sometimes, including Nagafen's Lair and Plane of Air.  There are many other specific bugs, too many to name here.<P>Customer service: currently gm and guides are severely restricted regarding how they can help players within the game.  This is especially true regarding epic quests.  Guides and GMs need to be allowed to help it's customers, obviously that is what they are there for.  To their credit, GMs and guides do try to help when they can, but obviously their hands are tied at this point which is a disservice to EQ customers.<P>Some final words.  Lately VI has been making changes in EQ which result in less customer satisfaction.  It's in VI's interest to discontinue nerfs in the EQ and instead concentrate on fixing bugs.  Otherwise they risk losing customers and their money, especially once serious competition hits the gaming market.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First off, 44 seconds, 1500hp, is about 205 hp per 6 seconds, not 300, making this situation no better at all. (1500hp/44seconds = 34hp/second. 34hp/second x 6seconds = 204.54 hp/6 seconds)<P>Second off, for the relative ease of this item to get, and its effect's power now after donals nerf, i can see this as ok. I dont think you should add a useless effect (as you yourself stated Abashi), but instead add one clerics might actually use, seeing as this item is a BP after all, it should have a more useful effect then the bracer of stability for cryin out loud (abundant food, which i find myself using more now then this heal). Reasonable requests for this effect would be Armor of Protection, Aegolism with a 30-45 second CT and regeant required, Bulwark of Faith, Heroism, Symbol of Marzin with regeant... etc you get the idea. If your going to make a big fuss over items that are right click heal, ill accept that, but at least give the item another spell we use alot like a buff, with a long CT so as to not be used in combat. <P>Its pretty sad that now looking over both donals and stability armor i can honestly not name 1 good effect that is reasonable to use in a regular group / raid situation. Pacify, AE 122dmg, Symbol of Naltron, CH with 7.5 recast per person, CE BP with 60 second CT, Word of Health (80hp group heal), Abundant food/water, Yaulp 2, Valor, Armor of Faith... /sigh. Compared to other classes like shamans who get a self only AC buff their class never gets, right click 267DD ice based, and buffs they actually might use once in a while. Wiz get right click nukes from VP / POG robe, Warriors get shielding line, str buff, invisibility , the list goes on. <P>Its pathetic and degrading how a non-caster (warrior) class gets better effects than one of the MOST important casters. I would honestly trade EVERY right click effect on donals / stability for the Cobalt greaves effect of invisibility... but thats another story.<P>The heal agro thing is utter BS. Yes it makes logical sense that the mob should go after the guy whos healing the person beating him down before killing the one whos doing the damage, but your BIGGEST PROBLEM in Velious is the simple fact that your mobs are Overpowered. Yes they can be killed, but long fights, right click heals, Complete heals that DONT KILL clerics in 1 cast are a MUST or you shouldnt even waste your time. Mobs that Quad for 850, Double for 1250, AE mana drain, Quad 450... REQUIRE HIGH HP heals... not Divine light, Not remedy, not Celestial elixir, but quick, high HP heals... PERIOD. <P>Dont design mobs that cant be killed unless they give out some uber quest that doesnt require killing another un-killable mob (Case and point - Sirran the Lunatic. He gives you keys in plane of sky, but is impossible to kill in all reality, thus it makes sense for him to be as hard as he is.) But someone like Velketor gives no quests to my knowledge, although i may be wrong here, but he hits for quad 850's, and basing this on logic, him being a wizard, quad attacking makes no sense at all... Hell double attacking makes no sense at all for a wizard. Another mishap no one notices.<P>Please test run (wow there is a concept, Testing... /gasp) these uber Velious mobs with your new healing agro changes, no right click heals, and without some rediculous army of no-lag 15+ cleric/rogue/warrior raids that are completely unrealistic in the EQ gaming world. Mobs like this need to: <P>a) be toned down as far as damage goes, HP, or realistically their boundaries should be (Velk being a wizard, and quadding, when he should be no more then doubling)<BR>b) Tested more thoroughly to fix problems with problem A before sending them live.<BR>c) fix healing agro so they can be killed again without unrealistic combinations of classes (a 45 person raid of 15 warriors, 15 rogues, and 15 clerics will never happen, although sometimes it seems thats what you test these mobs with. O yes, no lag either)<P>Sorry for the long post, but one thing led to another, all these stupid changes without enough or any testing at all are just not making verant look good, and not making any of its high-level customers happy. I am yet to see one post of a person saying, "yes thank you, this healing agro "fix" really made my EQ experience better" because it hasnt, and it never will until you fix the broken game. <P>Spend time testing bugs / errors that really are problems in the EQ game... PATHING comes to mind of certain mobs that like to poof, pop up on people's heads without even running to them... yet all these are overlooked to draw problems in an area of gameplay (healing agro) that has not been once touched based upon since my eq life began back in june 23 1999.<P>Disgruntled,<BR>Biffins<BR>Level 60 Halfling cleric, &lt;Vis Maior&gt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is ... lame. It is really really lame. Think I'll go play a twink or stop playing altogether. Hey, my friends from the game can talk to me through email and ICQ from now on. The CE bp was NOT an earthshattering, raid making item. I cannot stand for 18-20 secs casting CE from the bp on a raid, group members get hurt too fast for that. Oh yes, I've tried it - people die and boy did I feel stupid for trying it. On a single group thing, it helped down time. That was it.<BR>Way to ruin the game for me Verant.<BR>You know, I realize that EQ is Verant's world. But didn't they create it so that other people can log in and have fun? Sorry, but I'm not having fun anymore thanks. I've stuck with the cleric class for a long time now, my first char created, my only char above 25 (and the other chars I have were plvled so I didn't even really work on a lot of their lvls). Yes, it was boring at times but for the most part I still enjoyed playing a cleric. Kunark came out and a lot of nifty stuff did as well. Wow, Mark of Karn that was FUN - oops sorry says Verant, gotta take it away. Okay, I dealt with that. Donal's bp - wow, that's awesome I'll probably never see one but you never know. Nerf it x3 thx Verant. Velious - wow, okay this quest bp rocks, its gotta nifty effect on it but won't cause large raids to get any easier. Verant says - you guys are just having too much fun with it, let's take this one away too! Oh and let's not forget the new cleric heal-death cycle they have now with aggro changes. Verant you really think dying is that fun for me? No actually it ISN'T.<BR>I think one of the things that really makes me mad is WHY did they put these items in the game in the first place? HELLO, isn't this the kind of thing testing is supposed to figure out? You think manaless heals are too unbalancing - you thought that with the Donal's bp, WHY did you put another manaless heal on another bp? Oh wait, we get manaless heals with our quest/PoG legs - lvl 34 word of health, heals 120 hp per group member and takes way too long to cast - manaless heal nerf that too, bet those darn high lvls will stand there for an hour while their cleric chain clicks their legs healing 3-5k of their hps, 120 hp at a time with this item!<P>As someone in my guild said earlier tonight, the Donals bp is a piece of crap now.<BR>So will the PoG one be.<P>Elessara DeathTouched<BR>High Priestess of Tunare<BR>Cats in Hats<BR>Drinal<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It's really funny....<P>VI doesn't want to put powerful effects on items that would aid in killing MOBs becuase they are trying to rescind thier previous method of balancing the game which was by adding items.  Yet I remember in a great many posts where Abashi referred to the armor and weapons greatly enhancing the characters abilities in battles.<P>Now, enter the new methodology....<P>They don't want to make the item dependant now for killing MOBs.  Which, if you don't get the gist of this post, means UNDOING what they have done already.<P>LOL, watch all the bones that get thrown when they loose 20% of thier subscription base over this, and pessimism about this game.  And, the fan faire they are having in California coming soon, I wouldn't doubt you see another expansion or add-on announced.  <P>IMO, VI wants to get rid of a majority of the higher level players, becuase lets face the cold facts here people.  These higher level players do nothing but complicate the development process for VI and spread nothing but trouble for everyone....lol...only becuase they beat VI to the punch.  Look at it the majority of the people who are joining EQ ATM, tons of people are signing up now, why should VI cater to the 15% of the population who have been playing for 2+ years when they could just retune the entire high level game for the other 85% of the upcoming population.  None of the majority of the effects ever effect these players anyway, A majority of these people will never have even heard of a Manastone or a Donal's Breastplate that casts a 20 second CH, or a Chestplate of Stability which cast Celestial Elixer every 20 or so seconds.<P>The higher level population is slowly being exterminated by VI and being replaced with those who just found this game, which don't know the better.<P>I guess I could speak for a majority of the higher level players across every server if I said to VI,<P><BR>YOU WIN<P><BR>Drin </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
