</FONT><HR>This is not a flame, but to people like LizardWizard, DO you even play a Cleric? I have played EQ since it's release, have 2 active accounts, Have high level Wizard, Shadow Knight, Druid, Ranger, Paladin, Shaman, and finally a Cleric, so I can easily relate to different peoples situations. With a good Cleric on board, I love to play my SK, or Ranger, I believe a Cleric, being the true Healer of Norrath is the true base of ANY group. I hate to solo, and love to group, because it's more fun that way. After actually working a Cleric up to 47th, I understand what work it is to keep up buffs, and healing in a full group, a challenging enough job to be patient, sit and med, buff and heal. I know that I and most other priest classes, forgoe looting, in order to med up for next encounter, our goal is to keep our group members alive. If we as healers, get aggroed on easily as we do now, HOW are we to do our jobs efficiently. AND at higher levels where MOBS are totally resistant to MAGIC of ANY kind, what good is Atone, Root, or an Enchanters Mem blur, when they simply get resisted? ANd ATone is a very poor spell for anything but to PL a noobie. At any rate, Clerics were not, and are not good Tanks, and most certainly not a solo Class. I play my Cleric to keep my friends in my group alive, and to serve that purpose, need a better chance to do so, so instead of the people who come here, and simply taunt us, offer up some helpful suggestions, try playing a high level Cleric, begin to respect the class, and THEN come here and tell us to simply live with it. Thank you, God Bless, and have a great day.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Now that you have changed the way NPC's aggro are you going to revisit the Cleric Breastplate?  The reason you made the change so you can use it once per 7.5m was a warrior and a cleric could kill anything as long as the warrior didn't die in the 10 second casting time.<P>Since clerics get aggroed on, they will be hit.  Thus having to heal themselves and breaking the pattern of using the breastplate.  My only claim is that 7.5m is a bit severe and perhaps should be lowered now that this other change has been made (perhaps 1 min).<P>Just a thought but it seems that clerics have had a lot of negative publicity as of late because you changed the most highly sought after piece of equipment and made it so clerics were less effective in general against higher level NPCs.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>i have been reading this thread and I am amazed at people's unwillingness to try different tactics on how to fight/heal.  We are in the world of Norrath.  Worlds change and evolve.  Why is it so horrible that we have to figure out different tactics to fight.  It makes us better and more knowledgeable players, that in the end will make us more valuable to our group no matter where we fight.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>In Sebilis last night, I was getting attacked almost as much as the warrior.  My group commented on the fact that now, after the patch, clerics need their own personal healers...  I guess that's why Verant gave Shaman and Dr00ds and easier time with Superior healing, etc.<P>I am dissapointed Verant.  I understand that AI would be angry with healers, at the same time, I think the aggro has been set WAY too high.  After one heal I couldn't even sit to meditate because of constant attacks.<P>Sure, it's logical that the AI attacks the healer, at the same time, isn't it illogical for the AI to completely ignore the rogue backstabbing it.  Or what about the bard singing it's obnoxious songs, and the magician, whose pet keeps attacking it.  I don't see many mobs running to attack the magician because of what the pet has done...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My experiances with it in western wastes:<P>about 50% of the time if i healed a target with Divine light or CH i would become the dragon's chew toy. About 25% of that time (12 of original) i would be able to get Divine Aura off and save myself. The other 75% of the time i was dead before my spell gems came back up, because i'm on modem. (note: this was after taking great measures to reduce the datarate of the fights, having all tanks us 2h weapons, rogues use shields, etc)<P>Also, from reading your posts on game mechanics surrouding this, i have to wonder. For groupheals, is the cap per person healed? Because they always had a harsh taunt before and i dont even want to think about them now...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't know why people are complaining so much.  Just think about it a little bit.  When in a fight with a magic-user and a melee class type, who do you usually go after first?  Of course, most groups focus on the magic-user first because they can do a lot of damage in a little amount of time but are disposed of rather quickly.  Now if a group was in a fight with a melee class type and a healer that kept healing the melee, who would the group want to focus on...of course it would be the healer, otherwise the fight would be prolonged.  If you fight like this, why wouldn't the NPC?  Players are always complaining about realism but this is a change to make the AI more realistic and you complain.  Go figure...AI, can't play with them, can't play without them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My primary character is a cleric.  I play him a lot.  I have some type of feeling for the effects of this patch.  First, let me say that I like the concept: NPCs should go after the healer first...I know my group does, when confronted with an enemy priest.  However, I feel that the amount of taunt now produced may be too high.  I don't have numbers written down to produce here but the amount of healing I've done vs. the amount of damage the tanks / nukers were putting in doesn't substantiate the amount of beating I took.  One heal a ways into the battle and I was being pounded on.<P>     Yes, it's more realistic for the mobs to take out a priest first.  But let's be honest here.  Is having a warrior stick out his tongue and call it's momma a bad name *really* going to persuade the mob to ignore that nuking wizard?  Sticks and stones, etc.  How realistic is the taunt skill?  And, if you really want to get realistic...since healing isn't a "bolt" type effect, how the heck does the mob know that I'm the one that did the healing?  All it knows is that bamm, the wounds are gone.  It has no clue who did the healing, yet it invariably comes running for me.  Realism is a desirable goal but gameplay should not be sacrificed.  Tone down the effects of this patch just a little and I think we'll be at a happy medium.<P><BR>  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

My warrior had taken the knight down to half of his HP, and my cleric dropped a Superior Heal on him, then sat down to med.  Low and behold the knight peeled off the warrior and went stright to the cleric about 20 feet away and started pounding on him, took 2 taunts to increase the warriors hate enough to pull him off the cleric.  That has never happened before this patch and that includes about 3 weeks of consant fighting in OT.

</FONT><HR>Absor don't lose the forest from the trees.  You continually state this change was done to correct a faulty game mechanic.  What I think you have missed is that mechanic has been in place sinc day one and your game has grown from 0 to 300k.  Fix what you percieve to be a faulty game mechanic and possibly lose a certain percentage of your player base.  That is not a sound business decision.  I am a 58th lvl cleric, I have played since the patch in all different situations.  Quest mobs, plane raids, kael giant runs, Dragon Nec, Soc. Velk, BOB, WW dragons and normal karnor/seb groups.  Some Places it made no difference at all, other places it was just plan stupid.  Cast 1 devine light, go through DA than DB, that is 36 seconds by the way and the mob still wont leave.  That is until I am dead.  I have figured out a tactic for some situations, this wont make many ppl happy, but it is to let the puller basically die.  This allows others to build some agro.  Please don't say, have a monk or SK pull because no on class should have to be required for a spot.  At least that is my understanding of the Vison.<P>If this had been in place on day one or close to day 1, the problem would have been much less.  But, Varent has placed this in after numerous dings done to the Cleric class.  This has caused I think an advasaral type situation.  Once again not really a good business decision.  Clerics as a whole are probebly the least greedy of class's when it came to do some thing for me type issues.  They tended to just play.  I am sure you all will create the game you want and when you are done you can look at it and say there you go, this is a perfectly designed game.  I hope when you get to that point you still have paying customers.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Quick post here.<P>The [b]result of this patch[/b] is that High Level MOBs (SoV mostly, due to the large amount of HP and damage output) just became more difficult.<P>Was this intended?  If not can we see the HP and/or damage output of MOBs in SoV reduced?<P>In a full (well rounded) group players can no longer take the same MOBs they could before the patch.  On any MOB that required 2 or more CHEALs to the Primary tank the cleric now spends a bit of time running in circles around the group while we try to pull the MOB off of her.  If I pull the MOB off of her (Druid - Backup healer) I get killed.  If the tanks pull the MOB off of her she has to heal again and the MOB generely kills her.<P>The same Encounter before the patch ended (9 out of 10 times) with the Cleric LOM and the Druid (Backup Healer) close to LOM.  Not as it ends now (8 of 10 times) with dead characters / evac / mass run to zone.<P>The point here is [b]not[/b] that the changes to CHEAL are bad.... Just that they made life a lot harder when fighting High level MOBS (Mostly in SoV).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't think anyone is arguing the uber-mob encounters are messed up.  Verant has even acknowledged there are issues there and hopefully they'll fix it really really soon.  The problems some are expressing, though, are people who are fighting low to mid 50s single MOB, waiting till the warrior is 25% health casting a CH and complaining about the MOB turning to kill the cleric.  That's like a wizzy complaining that that same mob is aggroing on him after he cast ice comet on consecutive turns at the beginning of the battle.  These people have gotten into a rut of this is how they do their job and are pissed off because they're too lazy to think outside the box.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>sfaist, I think you are only reading a selective number of posts.  The problem isn't with just ch, actually for me ch still agros less than my lower level heals.  Any heal now will get you pounced on.  For fun I actually tried healing with Nalrons Mark off my Donals legs, guess what, I actually got attacked for that.  CH is not the only issue.  The Uber mobs are not the only issue.  There is more to this than just heals.  In Fear the mobs where all over me, even when I hadn't cast a spell.  They seemed to know I was a cleric.  In Kael at either the Arena area or King area I couldn't seem to get the Giants to agro on me no matter what I tried.  There are other examples going both ways.  My group in both situations were basically the same.  I think Varent also played around with some of the mobs and let them recognize clerics right off the bat as soon as agro has been established.  And a heal will just increase that agro with those mobs.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>PS. Verant dont post such stupid self serving messages on your news page without reading one or two of the other posts that go along with it. The whole thread is about people that hate the change but the only part that was shown was a single post of a 300+ post thread that actualy was to your favor. about 90% of the remaining ones were NOT. Consider this another one.<P>Your development teams are stupid if they think this will enhance the enjoyment of the game for anyone not into the S&M thing.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ive been considering this problem of the hate/heal nerf recently implimented. while i agree that the change wasnt necessarily a bad one, i think they over did it.  since the patch i, as a shaman, have had to spend the majority of my time and more importantly, mana on casting root to keep my cleric, or whoevers healing, alive.  i make it a policy to have EVERY caster with root to keep it up and use it whenever possible.  root is a fairly low mana use spell.  the fact that it drains a considerable amount of my mana should prove that im casting it a helluva lot.<P>look. lighten up on the hate generated from healing. ive seen THREE tank types try to keep a drolvarg rager off of a cleric repeatedly after ONE casing of CH.  and this is after i slow it, and root it and dot it. then i sit down right near it.  just to try to see if i can agro the mob.  usually that will pull it off the cleric, and being a shammy with relatively high ac, i can take the hits better than a cleric can.<P>absor, you asked that we test this out and try different tactics.  one you suggested was give the cleric a DS. hahahahha.  even with the clerics own buffs and mine, we tried this, and the cleric almost died twice.  and im quite good at keeping folx alive having played a shaman for over a year now.  it is WAY too hard to try to keep mobs off the healer, esp a cleric.  i agree some increase in hate was needed, but not this much. please lower the hate generated from healing.  <P>this has been brought to you from a shaman who has tried out many different tactics with the new nerf implemented (seeing as we have no choice but to adapt to new game mechanics). but i implore you to please lighten the load somewhat.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
