Thankfully the GM can suspend ppl like this - the rest of us have to put up with them, and maybe even stay grouped and rely on them.<P>GM was just and true. Colla took it further and someone higher up reviewed it and saw what a twat Colla is. At lvl 50+ he's like Old Man Burns. Scrooge and on a Power-Trip.<P>Probably if he was an Essex boy would get into many fights, but as he's probably in America (and you guys are less violent) he sits by himself in a String Vest. To have 3 high lvls suggest that he never goes outside after work... oh hang on - he don't wrk does he... we got FIRED by Sony!<P>LOL Kudos SONY!

</FONT><HR>ROFLMFAS...the poster is a perfect example for a fool. For one, I do not believe he warned the buyer to have a slot open due to the fact that he had the nerve to pick up the wurmslayer and not let the buyer know he dropped it. It is that fact that makes me believe he gave no warning. Also, even if he was warned what gives him the right to keep what was rightfully paid for? <P>And, why did you argue over this to the GM? You are more stupid than the one who purchased the wurmslayer (actually, I don't think the purchaser was stupid, he made an error that can happen to anyone). People do not need someone like you--in EQ and in RL. Your lame threats (and YES they were threat) even made you look more like a fool.<P>You could have walked away, just give back the wurmslayer or the money but you chose to argue about it. And after arguing, you then chose to threaten. It was through your own stupidity that you got banned.<P>/e waves good bye to the fool and smiles inside knowing that yet another untrusty one is gone from the land of Norrath</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is amazing. I am so glad you were banned. Sounds to me like you are an ex-GM, who knew the rules and figured out a way around them. It's also clear to me that this was plznned for 2 reasons. <P>#1) I have heard of alot of players taking advantage of the fact that the wurmslayer does not fit in a bag. Thankfuly it does now, and this scam is no longer able to be pulled off. <P>#2) Once caught you had no interest in actualy just returning the item. You just gave him his cash back so you couldgo pull this off on someone else later on when that particular GM was not on. <P>The buyer got lucky that there was a compasionate GM onlie, because not all of them would have done this. Poor guy did'nt even seem to realize what had happened because he was literaly begging you to SELL him the weapon after you had just riped him off. I don't know if this is within the GM's rights to do this or not, but if it isn't it SHOULD be. For gods sake i once found a MOSS sitting on the ground in sro, and i did an ooc saying i had found something on the ground and if someone in the zone is missing something they should give me a tell. The guy who lost it didnt even know it. He was very happy to get it back.  I never said in ooc what i had found.. so he gave mw a tell, and i asked him what he had lost, he told me, and i gave it to him. Thats the way the game should be played. <P><BR>theres my 2cp</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>PLain and simple, Verant was wrong.  Col capitalized on someone's stupidity.  The Wurmslayer was in the tradebox, the 5.3 k pp was in the coin holder, they both clicked trade.  Over and ****ing done.  If Jumlace was dumb enough to drop the item, intetionally or not, then he doesn't deserve the sword.  Anyone who says that this is morally worng...you're right.  However, I don't think anyone has the right to enforce morals in a service which I pay for.  If they do, it should be because I let them.  I can't wait for Planetside to come out, once it does, I'm out of EQ for good.  This kind of GM lording is why I hardly ever consort with other players in any way at all.  It's too freakin risky.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Why was he not banned... And so the supervisor takes it upon himself to ban him for the warning that actually got the account banned (Being the 4th the one for the trade scam).<P>So anyway you look at this you have to ask yourself the question... Sure we pay for the accounts but how more linient could they have been? If you ask me he had been asking for this banning for a long time and now that he got it he has to sit there and whine because he can no longer play.<P>Again I support the GM's decision in this and his supervisor's as well.

</FONT><HR>Quotes from -Colla-<P>                      1. I have never done anything wrong and I get banned all of a sudden over<BR>                      such a ludicrous thing. There is something wrong with this picture.<P>                      2. I know this was wrong and I have stated that.<P>                      3. I have not seen anyone get a warning for anything in the last 6 months.<BR>                      They just disappear instead. <P>                      4. Since buying this game 23 months ago I have done many things with<BR>                      many GMs. Never have I been forcefully interrogated though and this will be<BR>                      fought. However, I shall pay Jumlace if need be. I do not believe this is<BR>                      legal on your part.<P>                      5. You have no power to do this and you have no idea who I am. This is not<BR>                      legal and I know it isn't and I will fight it.<P>                      6. I do not make threats. *sigh* ever since Sony bought Verant and we got<BR>                      fired they'll hire anyone. I'm am done discussing this for now.<P>                      7. Threatening? This was recorded and now I will fight this to the extreme.<P>                      8. See you guys in a few days I will post the chat log ont he website and<BR>                      Verant will not be very happy in a few days. See you then Sorry.<P>                      9. You may remember me from our last fiasco, in which you had to put the<BR>                      "Active members" restriction on the message posting because I was banned<BR>                      once before and got over 530 players posting on my message protesting it<BR>                      (an EQ message board record which I am damn proud of).<P>                      I do not wish to cause another uproar, but you should know better than to<BR>                      treat players the way you have as of late.<P>                      Now I will post where the threats are.<BR>                      #5, #7, #8, <P>                      On on top of it all you personally attack the GM.<BR>                      #6<P>                      And you question the GM's authority in...<BR>                      #4, #5<P>                      Suck it up man, You were banned before and were lucky enough to get out<BR>                      of it the first time and the you have the nerve to pull off this stunt. The<BR>                      reason you were banned is because you had more then your fair share of<BR>                      warnings on your account, from a banning and a suspention to god only<BR>                      knows what else.<P>                      No matter how hard you try to fight this you were wrong. You admited so<BR>                      yourself. Now go on your marry way and give it up.<P>                      Dark.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Don't you all see how this can happen to you?<P><BR>Giving someone bad lip is a freakin american constitutional rights! -- but when playing EQ, I guess WE HAVE NO RIGHTS.<P><BR>You people bashing Colla are absolutely right about him being a jerk by not giving back the item. But defending the GM's action? Why? What have you to proove that the GM's actions was legal? Are you an ex-GM who knows the rules of what is bannable and what is not?<P><BR>And why would a GM be threatened by a player?<P>Is there something special about Colla that scares him?<P>Does he know something that us regular players don't know about what is legal and what is not in EQ?<P><BR>If that was me in the interogation room:<P>Jumlace says, 'Hail'<BR>Jumlace says, 'Hail'<BR>Me says, 'Good bye!'<BR>/exit<P>because in the end, THAT IS what the only real power we have over the game. THE POWER TO QUIT.<P><BR>We can't complain because of the risk of getting banned. And we can't email them because they're gonna say YOU ARE HARRASING US, YOU WILL BE BANNED.<P>OMG, can't you see it?
