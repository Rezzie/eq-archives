</FONT><HR>I know this topic has been brought up before, but I thought I'd bring it up again and perhaps nag Verant enough to actually do something about it.  It is pretty much common knowledge that the casters have gotten the "shaft" in terms of loot in Kunark.  While tanks have a never ending list of OMG items (when they are first found and stats read, the group all goes "OMG") there are absolutely none for the casters (only one comes to mind that casters can wear, the Heriphant Cloak which, of course this is not a caster only item). In fact there are semi-common weapons that put the weapons that drop off the gods to shame.  Yet there is nothing for the caster.  It's pretty sad when one of the better items for casters in Kunark is a +2int +30mana item that goes in the ranged slot.<P>This lack of caster loot was again brought to my attention with the Mana Robe which drops off Trakanon.  First off, why are we revisiting Cryosilk again?  Can't casters get their own class specific equipment instead of being forced to share it with every other caster class?  Secondly, THAT'S IT?  That's our OMG item?  14ac 8int and a really watered down version of the manastone?  This is like taking an int, mana, and stats hit to do something most of us were doing pre-kunark (without the casting time).  Can someone please explain to me why can't casters at least get an OMG item off of Trakanon?  The CRoA is still the best caster robe outside Veeshan's Peak, yet all of the tanks plane's gear has been upgraded significantly.<P>Perhaps Verant thinks that casters "don't need loot as much as tanks" however I think you need to realize that we'd like to be rewarded for our efforts as well, so please get with the program and ballance this thing out a little bit.<P>Thalanthas Brightspire<BR>Sorcerer of Da`Kor<BR>Erollisi Marr Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The only part of this I'll really agree with is the facet that most...if not all...of the Kunark caster items are simply that...Caster Items.  Save for a few Necro-only peices that have dropped here and there, most everything is either Caster-only or All/All which -really- bugs me.<P>Some examples of good items though are the Drachnid Thyxl, Dustcryers Ball (Which is ultimately cool), Froglock Bonecasters Robe (not as hard to get as it seems...), that orb thingy, can't remember the name of it, been two weeks since I've played (damn Diablo II) and etc...<P>I wouldn't worry too much about the equipment so much as the lack in diversity among the caster classes loot.  Casters have always been behind on loot in general, but how many different ways can you divy up mana and +int?  If anything, they should start cranking out low +int, medium +mana, and high +resist gear.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Exactly, only the Hierophant cloak is a real upgrade to plane gear (or top of the line gear found elsewhere pre-kunark, read: dragons/gods, then again the White Dragonscale isn't that much worse than the Hierophant).  The Bonecaster?  Only people without planes robes wear this.  Book of Obulus is okay, a minor upgrade, but nothing specia. Same with the Thyxl, and cone of the mystics.  <P>I had full planer gear except for carmine pants pre-kunark.  The only slots I've upgraded since kunark came out are my two weapons slots (cone of mystics and book of obulus), my shoulder slot (meditative blanket, again another one that has to be shared with countless other classes) and the Dustscryer Ball.  That's it.  Four slots, and none of them significant upgrades to what I had previous. NONE of them are Wizard only, and only ONE that is Int Caster only.  So not only are casters not getting equip, but when there is an item or two that they can use it must be shared with all Int and Wis casters, as well as tanks too on occasion. This is far from ballanced with the tanks in my guild that I group with daily.  They have long since discarded a lot of their planes gear along with those God/Dragon weapons we strove so long to get for them.  Something seem very out of whack here...  <P>Thalanthas Brightspire<BR>Sorcerer of Da`kor<BR>Erollisi Marr Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well, having loot is both a good thing and a bad thing.  On one hand, all the oohs and aahs of getting new loot.  On the other, is the tediousness of having to actually ACQUIRE all those things.  Right now on my list of things I NEED are cobalt bracers/legs/bp, a NoS, Fingerbone Hoop, Grim Pauldrons, and some sky quests that I need one more item for.  I've basically had to replace all my gear since lvl 50, often several times.  Many times I just want to not have to worry about items and just have fun exp'n or joking around with friends.  Instead I have to keep on trying to get new equipment to stay ahead of the curve on my server.  Gear is both a bane and blessing.<P>I think that the spells casters get at 50+ was supposed to offset the lack of loot in Kunark.  Too bad most of the spells lack the "phat lewt" luster that melee equipment has. =(  I really feel for you casters, it sucks having to share your gear with another class.<P>--Parv, 57 halflink myrmidon, LoS</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Or perhaps even the concept of a +XXX mana and minor pluses to saves?  Cap your int/wis and you can have room for this sweet gear, a little incentive to get all the best.  <P>(Please don't mention AC, I would turn down a 150AC robe if it doesn't help the mana pool :) ... shades of the Annihilator Rod )<P>cheers,<BR>Northerner_<P>(and yes, none of my casters are anywhere near old enough to get any of this stuff ;)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Casters have gotten tons of items all over Norrath.  Sure, there is a lower concentration of them (found, anyway) in Kunark, but I'd hardly say that they have "gotten the shaft" as you put it.  There's more than enough items out there for casters.  Kunark fauna just happens to be more melee-centric than other places.

</FONT><HR>I think I've responded to this same thread in different forms a few times.<P>Perfect Flaw said:<BR>"Some examples of good items though are the Drachnid Thyxl, Dustcryers Ball (Which is ultimately cool), Froglock Bonecasters Robe (not as hard to get as it seems...), that orb thingy, can't remember the name of it..."<P>The orb thingie is Cone of the Mystics...  It's hardly "average."  Same goes for the Thyxl.  Most 200 int casters benefit from holding these items, as they offer reasonable +int, and the loved +mana.<P>Elans_Twink said:<P>"I'd like to see some, caps, legs, wrists, rings, etc. start dropping for robe-types. Make them have some interesting stats so we can try to move gear around based on situations."<P>You must not be looking in The Hole (not Kunark, per se, but Kunark timed).  Loam Legs are the only +INT legs outside of Sky, Loam Amice is better than most planar shoulders, and only inferior IMHO to the sky quest shoulders and Squallsurge Shawl.  Loam Boots are potentially better than eboots for enchaters (+8 agi dex and cha, +15 mana) as well.<P>Lots of the items dropping do have minor save adjustments.  A Kunzar Cloak (not that exciting of an item) has a +fire save where a lot of not-so-godly dressed casters might have been wearing Icebear before (+cold).<P>I realize the focus of your argument was HIGH LEVEL caster gear, but lets revisit Hole again.  Since you're not interested in your DEX and AGI being over 75, perhaps I can interest you in a Brell's Girdle. (MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM AC: 10<BR>+10 STR, -5 DEX, +10 STA, -5 AGI, +50 MANA WT: 0.1<BR>Class: ALL Race: ALL)  Sure beats wearing Strawspun for AC or BCC for 4int and 12hp.  Smoldering Brand drops there too if you want a 9/22 ALL ALL 1HB weapon.  Nice if you want to pretend to be a Magician.<P>Also, while there may be overflowing Melee drops, you don't think they needed them?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Theft of Thought keeps my mana pool VERY full - I don't need more INT or CHA or mana.  HP/AC is all i really care about now..  That and looking cool anyway.. =)  <P>Hell, give us a couple of interesting pieces of armor with crappy stats, but a chain or plate "look" and people would flock to them - kinda like GE armor but with bad stats, or maybe with good AC/STR bonuses, just caster useable.  Flayed stuff is a good example of an implentation of this kinda idea - just expand on it.  They don't have to be GOD-like items, just cool stuff that offers a choice for people who have enough INT/mana<P>Throw in a couple of pieces of armor with high AC that have some stupid (but useful) spell... true north, alliance, etc... with some 15 sec cast time like all the other classes get.  No matter how bad the piece stunk, all us casters would dig on it.<P>You say that melee's have so much room for expansion, well.. I would have agreed - BEFORE KUNARK.  There are melee items up the wazoo.  Now, casters are in the need of expansion.  With a bit of imagination and non-sterotypical thought process (ie all casters care about is INT and mana) the possible caster items are tremendous.<P>-Ethandrin<BR>54 Enchanter <BR>a BCG away from greatness.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Perhaps have a "Ghoul magi's rod of flame" which makes all fire spells a tad more efficent?<P>- How about a robe, that when right clicked would cast a buff on yourself, this buff would act like death pact, where randomly (semi-rarely) when you got low on HP, it would cast a low-lvl shield/ruin skin on the wearer of the robe.<P>- What about a haste item for casting? <P>- Is there any plausability of making dex/agil effect casting more?

</FONT><HR>Perhaps you should consider making items for casters that are "useless" by the standards of int and mana to give casters more of a choice.  For example, a casters only robe with AC 20, plus 10 str, and 50 hps and a cool new look would present casters with a choice.

</FONT><HR>   Well Abashi, you have identified the problem and let the solution fly right over your head. Of course if you limit yourself to just +int and +mana items you will run out of things you can do. And as most casters can attest, the other stats aren't worthwhile to boost much, if at all. But those are not the only areas where casters could be improved, you could for example:<P>- Expand on the project that was started months ago to add items into the game that made pets stronger. Add some new, high level ones and perhaps sprinkle a few around for shaman.<P>- Have items that boost the strength of spells in a certain school. Said items could be limited by class and possibly religion. Maybe a couple generic ones just so classes who don't get something right away still have an item to play with till their class can get attention (but the deity/class specific stuff should be stronger or there will be little incentive to use it, and cause the better item to become way over camped).<P>- Add items that reduce casting times, either across the board, or for specific schools. Hell, add both, make items that lower the casting time for one school lower it more than items that lower it across the board.<P>- Add items that store mana for later use, with varying degrees of efficiency. A lower level item could store a small amount of mana, but it would take ALOT of mana to charge it, where a high level item could store more mana and the transfer wouldn't be as costly.<P>Sure, these items would make players more powerful. But that is the idea of going forth and taking risks, to get items that make you stronger and better than before. Too often I feel like upgrading my equipment is moving laterally, I guess it isn't, but the boost is so insignificant I often ask myself why I bothered in the first place. (but of course I play a shadow knight, and I often ask myself why I have stubbornly played this class to level 40, I probably would have had more fun, and gotten to a higher level much easier playing just about anything else)<P>Yoshua Gilbert</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Give casters a few charges of a cleric spell, or a druid spell. Casters should get some cool little expendable toys. I remember finding a wand on a vampire bat when I was level 12 on Wisp Isle. I thought back then, wow.. i wonder what high level wands are in this game? Well... needless to say, many months later, I never saw another one. Kind of a shame really.

</FONT><HR>Gordon.<P>Before the days of Parsers, and spoilers, and FAQs... noone really knew exactly what benefits other stats gave really.<P>I started my Dorf Cleric to be a battlecleric. Put only 5 points into Wis, and the rest into STR, DEX and AGI. Later on, I discovered, like so many others, what exactly were the most important stats for me, ie.. WIS, AC, MANA, HPS, AGI, DWARFISHNESS.<P>In the early days, MANY casters wore the Green Silken Drape. Why? There were other robes out there that gave Intelligence? Because Casters believed that DEX helped casts rate/interrupts. There were theories that AGI helped fizzle rate, and all sorts of mystique. Nowadays, people know the truth, that most stats are irrelevant. Perhaps if some of the other stats really helped the caster class, like Charisma for some, then casters would be more varied in their wants/needs.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I agree with the idea of this post 100%. I am the first lvl 60 Enc on Rodcet Nife and have been on the server since its begining. I can't see how its possible to "run out" of ideas as you stated Abashi on caster loot ideas. I hear great reasonable ones all the time. Your enforcing the stereotype caster as only caring about +int and +mana items is far from absolute. Its just whats been put upon us with little diversity. The RoA was a great invention that added colour and flare without any real impact on balance to a caster. However that fun item was moved well out of anyones reach and is now most liekly unobtainable in any forseeable future. Id also liek to say that indeed I care allot about AC and with my own buffs hit 702ac and with clr buffs 728. It makes a huge difference in my play and adds to my overall effectiveness ina group. Now AC is my choice and for that my int suffers some. Understandable however mixed AC mana int items are just another type of variable to add to amix of what could be many ideas in both held caster items, rnaged slots, weapons, shields etc. Loam of course is a joke if anyone wants to compare it to Kunark class armours for everyone BUT pure casters. Where is my bracer that casts augmentation etc. Now I say this tounge in cheek simply becasue that brings up another issue entirely. Does anyone even use Kunark armour effects anymore? *Hears crickets* Nope no one I know. Excpet for the shaman bracer with last i heard 8 sec cast time no other Kunark armour is being used fo rits effect at all. THe only reaosn is its different colour and its more ac. AC as everyone now knows is the only stat that really matters at all that and your level. Where did the mystery and diversity all go? 12 seconds to summon an arrow?

And there isn't much room to switch out to play with other stats.<P>I would personally have LOVED to maximize my resists, but this isn't a very bright thing to do if my int drops below 200.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>What are you talking about?!  No loot?  You are nuts!<P>What the heck do you think spells are?  As far as I can see they are only dropping in Kunark, and they are only for casters.<P>Personally, I think the high lvl spells are far too accessable to be fair.  You want to talk about loot drops, try looking for class specific armors.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I think you have to consider that pre-Kunark loot waes much better for casters than melee, relatively speaking.<P>I was playing around with equipment configs the other day and I found that I can get my wizard from his base int of 125 to 200 AND have +625 Mana and +325 HPs worth of gear on at the same time.  This config only took 1 Planes drop (Runed Bolster Belt) and 2 Kunark drops (Sarnak Cerimonial dagger, Enshrouded Veil).  Everything else came from Old Norrath.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well I can say that I haven't seen any caster gear but I have seen some very nice melee gear (focusing on the very nice weapons found in Dalnir such as the Tower blade and Sap of piety). I'd like to see more caster gear, but not all or most in one area or dungeon as in the old world (ie Guk/Najana). One nice and easy piece of necro gear is the forsaken pariah mask (don't laugh). Its very very easy to get and that -30 or so charisma is great for making fear last a long long time. Plus AC5 on a mask for a caster is not too shabby. Iskar pariahs drop them near the FoB entrance in WW. BTW they are no drop.    </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I think the spell drops should be increased to give casters better loot.<P>Also, you should put self/group buffs as effects on class specific items.  One existing example is the necro only DMF effect robe.  Put in a caster item with effect: shield of the magi, etc.<P>Sayleth</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
