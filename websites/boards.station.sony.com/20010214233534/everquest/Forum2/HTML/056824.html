&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>The next big MMORPG is going to knock EQ off as “King of the Hill” because:<P>I’m not going to go into a whole lot of detail here because much of what I am going to say has been discussed in detail in other threads. What I want to do is get the major issues with the game all in one post so VI can see them “in a nutshell”. I would also hope that all you creative people out there will point out anything I miss, and I hope you can make great suggestions for improvement! Let’s get everything in one post, and let’s hope they address the major issues soon:<P>Those who reply please try to stick to broad major issues; let’s not get into nit-picky details. Here’s why EQ will go the way of the dinosaur as soon as another great MMORPG comes along:<P>1) Lacking content, lacking of fun:<P>a) The game is supposed to be Ever“Quest”, not Ever“Hack-n-slash”. Quest rewards need to be better at all levels of play. Too much of the really awesome equipment in the game is just dropped.<P>b) There aren’t enough fun things to do at the end-game for small groups. Not everything fun should be a major production requiring you to get your whole darn guild together. It’s hard to get 2 or more groups of high level people together at the same time, so it happens infrequently.<P>c) Trade skills are lacking. Some of the best items in the game should be made by master craftsmen. All items should be producable at a reasonable price and sellable at a reasonable profit based on the level of the craftsman and the buyer.<P>d) 100 real days played to reach level 60 is too long. 50 Days played seems more reasonable. How much hack and slash can you stand? Wouldn’t it be nice to have a couple of uber-toons in your stable if you are a hardcore gamer, instead of just one? If you have gotten to be high level, but you decide you don’t like your toon, don’t you continue to play it anyway because the time investment to start over is too great?<P>2) Class Balance (the current hot topic):<P>The problem here is that the classes most in need of help don’t seem to be getting the necessary attention, and I anticipate little help from VI based on what things have begun on the test server. These are the classes I think are most in need of help with balance, particularly at higher levels.<P>a) Rangers (offense only marginally better than warriors, yet pay heavy defensive penalties)<BR>b) Monks (same as rangers but pay even more defensive penalties, plus too much taunt built into their attacks)<BR>c) Bards (they die to much – agro needs to be lowered for songs)<BR>d) Shaman (are supposed to be the best at buffs, they aren’t)<BR>e) Clerics (are technically balanced, but boring in battle – give these guys something to do besides heal)<P>Ok everyone, please post any major issues I missed, and let’s have some awesome ideas on how to make the game more fun!<P>Thanks for reading.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>All the things you mentioned above are just some of the reasons why EQ is fun and why its the "King of the Hill" EQ would be borring if all the classes where truly ballanced and everything worked as is was intended to.<P>EQ is because of the..<BR>1) Beggers asulting you every time you hit the bank.<BR>2) someone asking you 20 questions cause they did a who 60 all *your class*<BR>3) the dificulty in reaching higher levels.<BR>4) all the bugs that get you killed.<BR>5) sitting at the zone and some lunitic trains you with like 40 mobs.<BR>6) zones crashing with like 80+ people in them and all you see is mass carnage.<BR>7) that 1 person on your server that manages to piss off everyone no matter what he does.<BR>8) the knowledge that no matter how long youplay you will probaly never get everything you want.<P><BR>Honestly how fun would eq be if when you first log on with a new character and kill that first a_rat_07 and he drops a brozne Bp and 50plat. and WHAM you get enough ex to make it to lvl 4 in 1 kill. if everything worked in EQ the way it was supouse to and no one was aloud to harras/bother you. EQ would have died out after like only 2 or 3 months if that long.  Its all the screw ups constant nerf/twinks and changes that make EQ the great game it is.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Priest_of_ SB:<P>I agree with everything you said. BTW, I’m betting on UO2 as the next killer app as well. The original UO was an awesome game for its time, I suspect that UO2 will be no less.<P>Aakala:<P>I agree that EQ should not be easy. I agree that true class balance is not and should not be acheivable. However, I strongly disagree with you espousing the game bugs as what makes the game exciting. Content is what makes a great game, not bugs.<P>So, let me try to focus responses here:<P>First, what I was hoping was to do, with your help, was identify the major shortcomings with EQ, and subsequently get some ideas for improvement. I also want suggestions for content improvement, not just fixing the shortcomings. I love this game and I hope Preist of SB is right and it will be around 5 years, but there is room for improvement. So let’s have suggestions for improvement!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Second, I did not mean for this to be a continuation of class talk. However, I think VI is right and that class balance needs to be put to bed before going forward with other improvements. So, what I would like are your opinions of which classes are most in need of help, and in the broadest sense why they need it (please don’t be detailed, the details are well documented in the class talk threads).<P>Thanks for reading   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>so you dont like the bugs in the game? tell me how many times we have sat at a zone knowing some n00b would hit that one bug that would kil him and we just sat back and laughed for minutes over it. like that one in WC where if you walked on the hill near the top you would fall to the middle of the zone (back when Hill Giants out numbered players like 5 to 1) and you would tell someone to walk up there cause its safe. then a few seconds later when he started screaming in ooc HG to zone. youwould just sit back with your friends laughing. now dont get all huffy with me about me being sadistic and all that. I know alot of people that knew about bugs that guided others into them for laughs. most people did this in one form or another. <P>n00b_001 says in ooc,' do these sand giants attack?<BR>you say,' nah they are harmless. just to make the zone look scary.<BR>n00b_001,' NOW LOADING.<P>But I agree some things should be looked into and fixed. Im just trying to point out that without all of these problems EQ woulnd be as much fun as it is now. I'm not saying that Bugs are cool or anything. just saying that they add a little something to the game. *hug* <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The class with the worst balance issues is wizards. <P>All other classes gets upset when someone gets part of their abilities and step on their toes. But all classes that can cast spells got wizards only ability. To do Direct Damage. And wizards dont have the versitility of any other class. Wizards was a disign fluke in the game and only way to "balance" it towards the current rules is to take away DD from all other classes and increase wizards effectivnes with DD. <P>But none of that will happen. Dont be suprised if EQ2 has wizard as only class and lets you specialise on the other professions later but the wizard we know in EQ1 wont exist anymore. Wizards are a failed experiment.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi all,<BR> One thing no one has talked about PKing in EQ is optional. Personaly this is the reason I started playing in EQ in the first place. I tried UO for around 4 months but got killed every time by players that were into murdering newbies, please dont tell me UO is player driven. After trying to find the area marshal/warden whatever I just plain got tired of being murdered. I have noticed that nowhere in the other posts has anyone mentioned that all the new games are defaulted toward Pking in all its glory. This will limit the game to those that enjoy that type of game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The only thing that will bring down EQ as the best MMOG to play is "The Vision".<P>"The Vision" says that players can only get to a certain level compaired to MoBs.<P>"The Vision" says that large groups are more fun than small groups.<P>"The Vision" says nerf two out of three problems. The 3rd you ingore until thousands of players complain, and then you "discuss" it. After the discussions, it's generally ignored for a while longer, and then a small positive change goes in.<P>The more they tighten the screws on this game, the less interesting it becomes. It really shows the limits of what the game can do. Everything you mention in these posts are all due to the limitations on the programmers, and the game itself. They can't continue to expand it forever.<P>I think the next "Killer App" as priest_of_SB called it, will be a game that can span multiple servers creating one world online. Instead of having 40 servers hashing out different versions of the same game, one giant world that all of the subscribers could play in at once would have to be it. Imagine having 350,000 players all on the same playing field as you. Vast Cities and real looking outdoor areas. A planet that can actually sustain 400,000 players at the same time with no lag.It would probably require Broadband connections or better to play. That's just the way games are.<P>On that world, players aren't forced to do anything. Tradeskills, PC/NPC combat, and Questing should all have equal risk and reward.<BR>That is what players want. Somewhere they can lose themselves and become somebody else for a while. Perhaps enjoy the game instead of worrying about getting some mundane item of some overbuffed under-conning MoB.   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok this what I believe or me 2cp worth of Knowledge here  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>1. Yes there should be content in game: example,trades should be deeper and skill lvls higher reason. There alot of very smart players in this game, players that certainly love to be challanged. To make something that is better than something that is dropped in game, but it takes skill, int, wis, etc to find to make quest for etc. this is content to me.<P>2.Should be able to have a building for Guilds in game or even a house for the married ones??<P>3.Should be able to play another npc type meeting of course a standard that is agreed on by VI and the player base example, a giant, how many 5,10 etc  will it be a random drawing?? or by quest??this would give the game greater depth to it.<P>4. A shop where someone would want to sell its wares. example: a baker?<P>these r only a few but could be much more oh one I like is searching for the Tome of wis, int dex, str, sta, and agil. but mind u these would be random not the same over and over so that 1 when does no else can do it because he posted it on how to do it.<P>Also all Iems should drop randomly certain items that drop from certain lvl mobs should drop somewhere else not just in 1 place this is wrong to me the way its set up now this would keep players guessing and moving??<P>oh well nuff for now  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>enjoy and look out here come Horizons  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
