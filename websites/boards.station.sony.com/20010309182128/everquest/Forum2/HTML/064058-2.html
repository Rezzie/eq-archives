</FONT><HR>Thanks Bloodsage, I am sorry I brought it up, apparently you have nothing to say but attacks on people.  My mistake.<P>Incidentally if you took 2 weeks off you'd come to the same conclusion about the game he did, all of you.  Its funny how stepping away changes your attitude and how you view it.  You won't really miss it much, you'll only miss those first few weeks when the game was fresh.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I do agree that, by the time you have gotten bored with the xp-giving content suited for a level range, you are still in the level range. So you have to camp xp to go do something interesting.  (nevermind camping 'level appropriate gear').<P>However, I do disagree that EQ is moving in the direction of requiring more time.<P>The latest nerfs to the two clerical BP's really do not effect normal xp'ing, they effect the epic encounters.<P>The clerical hate nerf was definitely overdone and I think Verant realizes this.  I truly believe the CH heal hate nerf was done to allow them to tune encounters so that the other healers stood a chance of fulfilling that role, no matter how slow.  That it was so overdone at first probably points more to the fact that Verant has made Test a rather high-level unfriendly place to be that this made it through to live.<P>On the other hand, there have been changes recently that actually *speed up* leveling:<P>- removal of xp penalties.<BR>- hefty xp bonuses in some dungeons.<BR>- constantly inflating the abilities of new weapons and equipment added to the game.<BR>- new mana regen abilities for various classes at various levels.<P>*Those* can effect all levels of players in XP'ing situations.<P>So no, I disagree with your premise that Aradune is specifically trying to make the game take longer.<P>Mike</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Grimstaff,<P>You are still clueless, aren't you?  And still refuse to discuss ideas rather than people.<P>As a matter of fact, I took several months off of EQ last year when I tried AC out.  I also took several months off the year prior due to RL committments.  I go for weeks at a time without playing, because I haven't a problem determining my life's priorities, as some here obviously do.<P>So. . .the fact that I've taken the time off, and still don't agree with Drakezius means you've not got a clue, hmmm?  Either about me _or_ the alleged Truth of his observations.<P>So, either defend your position via some kind of logical discussion, as I have done, or go back under your bridge.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Grimstaf, I cannot and will not try to analyse Bloodsage but perhaps I might shed a bit of understanding light on your confusion.<P>Bloodsage is a professional military officer and an aviator.  I have recently retired from that same profession and background--28 years worth.  Does this make either one of us perfect or particularly wise?  Absolutely not.  But, if you know anything about the military and aviation in particular, you will understand that the culture found in that profession breeds individuals who tend to "not suffer fools gladly".  Because fools get you killed.  In real life.<P>Bloodsage could word some of what he says to be a bit less confrontational and certainly could be a bit less abusive at times.  That said, I have rarely read anything by Bloodsage which is far off the mark content-wise.<P>The biggest gripe that his (or my) background will generally have is with people who refuse to take responsibility for their own actions.  These type of people are at best offensive and at worst dangerous to have around.  The attitude that all ills are the fault of something or someone else is so pervasive on these boards that it is truly frightening to anyone who is in a profession a wingman can get you killed in a heartbeat.<P>I've found Bloodsage to be intelligent, pointed, articulate, helpful, abusive, arrogant, at times wrong.  Okay.  So what?  In my opinion, he is usually dead on the money, even if I would have worded it differently.  But then, I wasn't a fighter guy, so what can I say.  They are ALL arrogant and ****y.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Why did I write this?  Bloodsage can certainly defend himself far better that can I.  But you see, not everyone feels that just because you disagree with someone that you should be entitled to belittle or flame that person.  Everyone is so concerned about "rights" and that is good as far as it goes but consider this:  freedom is doomed if there are rights with no responsibility.  Because then anarchy reigns.  You may have the right to say something.  It doesn't mean it is the responsible thing to do.  Nor does it mean you will not suffer the consequences of someone elses displeasure.<P>/emote kicks the soapbox into the junk corner.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I've gone from heated debate to polite conversation in the space of a single post.  But, unlike Absor, I'm not paid to take abuse, and I choose not to.<P>If you have a problem with something I've said, then feel free to show me where I erred.

</FONT><HR>Im supposed to believe that Bloodsage is a military pilot and has time to play Everquest?  Sorry if I am a bit skeptical, maybe if he was a desk jockey.  Any pilots I know have neither the time nor inclination to play computer games, except the rare Flight Simulator.  Not saying its not true, but that seems very unlikely, to say the least.<P>And being in the military or having a great love of freedom has nothing to do with people disliking something and attacking them.  I love freedom too, as far as you know I'm a Brigadier General (I'm not, I am a freelance artist and writer), but that has nothing to do with consistant attacks on people.<P>Bloodsage defends Verant, he doesn't castigate whiners.  He doesn't attack ANYONE unless they say something critical about Verant.  That doesn't have anything to do with freedom or personal responsibility.<P>This post was an opinion by someone, saying he was spending too much time playing Everquest and getting little benefit from it.  This is true for almost everyone who plays Everquest, we have too much free time on our hands, all of us, to play a computer game for hours a day.  The poster noticed it, and did something about it.<P>For that he gets flamed by someone who never get warned because he defends Verant and there is a disturbing trend here on the boards of anyone who is on that side of the fence being able to say and do whatever they want.<P>There ARE people who work at Verant who post here, and they aren't likely to post critical things about their job on a public board.  Further, they are very likely to defend their company, because young companies tend to have a lot of loyalty in their workers, especially this kind.<P>I thought it was ironic Bloodsage thought I was talking about him when I noted that, I never mentioned him at all.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

It was not simply the musings of someone who's taken some time to reflect upon Life.  It is a rather blatant attempt to blame Verant for his lack of self-discipline and skewed personal priorities.  And it ends with the disclaimer--that you seem to use, also--that anyone who disagrees is a VAK or a troll.<P>Nice way to start a conversation, no?<P>Have you anything at all to say regarding ideas, concepts, the actual topic of this thread?  You claimed that, had I or anyone else actually had the discipline to quit for a couple of weeks, we'd agree with Drakezius.  I showed you that's not the case.  And your only rejoinder is to imply that I must be lying about who I am, and be an undercover agent for Verant Interactive who is allowed to operate outside the rules here?<P>Why is it that anyone who disagrees with you, and argues from a consistent philosophical basis--correctly identified by Cloudrider--must be part of a grand conspiracy by Verant to undermine your small band of free-thinking heroes fighting oppression and evil?<P>'Splain, Lucy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Everquest is now boring because there is 1) no point to the game, 2) the combat system is lame, and 3) There is no roleplaying.<P>Now, lets say i wanted to roleplay a warrior who hated orcs because orcs killed my brother. Good idea in theory. But, orcs couldent have killed my brother because no one ever dies in the game. Now, lets say i wont to play as a mage who wants to kill lady vox because the mage's town was destroyed by lady vox. Now, i can't do that either because 1) Towns cannot be destroyed, and 2) Lady vox comes back to life if you kill lady vox. So you can't win, and you can't lose. Since this is an internet-only game some people would say that not being able to win and not being able to lose is a good idea. However, you should be able to acheive something in the game, and you should be able to truly die in the game. Im not saying make it so that you die forever every time you die, however it should be possible. How about have a low chance of dying permanantly every death, or rather, make it so that if you advance past a certain point there is a possibility of permanant death. So in order to become truly powerful, you have to risk permanat death. EQ was fun for awhile, and it still is, sometimes, but i will quit this game if a game comes out in which you can acheive something worthwile other than hitting level 60.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Perhaps that's why I'm _not_ angry at Verant: I've got the perspective to realize I have all the power, because I can take my business elsewhere anytime I choose.<P>Therefore, I simply enjoy the game as they present it, until the point I'm no longer having fun, then I'll quit.<P>Easy.<P>Perhaps some of the zealots attempting to remake EQ in their own images will get the clue.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What other multiplayer game has been as successful as EQ?  None that I can think of.  Sure UO might still be around, but is it really that successful?  Alot of people dropped UO when EQ came out, and nothing else has been able to drop as many people from EQ.  Not even the randomness of AC..   The spawn locations change everyday, and the whole world is dynamic..  but EQ still reigns supreme.<P>Now this isn't to say that one of the newer multiplayer games coming out won't put EQ in it's grave, but that's inevitable with any product...  games in particular..  but right now EQ isn't going under, in fact it continues to grow..  so while you may have become bored with EQ, there are many others still enjoying it, or just starting to find out what it's all about..  <P>The game is about fun..  it's about choice..  but it's not about being able to do anything that you want to do..  There has to be rules and there has to be limitations..   there has to be something to make it EQ, and not UO or AC..  EQ is going to be the game that it's designers make it. They accept input from us to help determine some of those decisions, but ultimately it's still their game...<P>If you dislike those decisions, and the game that results from it or you no longer enjoy that game, why try to put other people's fires?  And since you've purchased a Sony Playstation 2, how is it you're going to have more time?  you can't play that at work can you?  well I'm getting into a rambling mood now so I better stop.. <P>In closing, I don't think Verant is perfect or that EQ is..  but it's the only game that has been able to hold my attention for so long..  It's the only game to have all the fantasy elements I enjoy available..  and yes I do take breaks from EQ, I read, I watch TV, and do all the other stuff I have to do in my everyday life, but I still come back to play again because I enjoy it..  <P>that does not make me a VAK or Troll..  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Since day one, there has been no point to the game (not many entertainment based activities have a point when you really get down to think about it)  You level up, get phat lewtz, and... level up.  <BR>  Secondly, well, pressing autoattack, and sitting back, occasionally pressing taunt or bash or kick aren't the greatest in the world mayhaps, but it keeps it simple.  Making it too complicated would absolutely kill people with slower systems, connections, etc.  <BR>  Finally, since day 1 I noticed there was no true roleplaying.  This isn't a D&D game, and to be perfectly honest, I doubt there will ever be a game which can truly be roleplaying that involves hundreds of thousands of people.  To force everyone to roleplay would be nigh impossible, and to then make characters (NPC's in particular) that reacted in a realistic manner, well, HUGE undertaking.  IMHO, I like EQ, I play a few nights a week, and I also spend time with my girlfriend, read books, play paintball, and generally just get out.  You have to look at it as a game, and get over it.<P>And to be honest, I think I see more eye-to-eye with Bloodsage here than I do with anyone else (well, outside of Groller, but he isn't in this one!)  Chalk it up to the fact I hate whiners period (which is what the first post here was, a whine directed at Verant) and let it be.

</FONT><HR>As much fun as the Bloodsage/Grimstaff debate  has been to read let's not forget that the original poster tossed out the first volley. His post was all well and good until the end when he said.<P>"May the usual mix of VaK trolls enter and defend thier "holy grail" of games to the death, as they allways do to posts such as these."<P>The implication being that to defend the game makes you a VaK. That is a slam pure and simple. I have not played the game for a month or more and regularly take breaks like this. When I play the game I have fun. I think it's a good game, not a perfect game, but a good game. <P>If you have to justify the time you spent in EQ and the justification was not "to have fun" then that's your problem to deal with. Either try to make it fun again or quit.<P>It gets really tiring to be labeled a VaK by a "disillusioned Eq Fanatic" player who seems to have lost the perspective that its just a game just because I have managed to keep my perspective in place.<P>Everyone has their right to love or hate this game as they see fit. Just because my opinion does not match yours or yours does not match mine does not make one of us right and the other wrong.

</FONT><HR>Grimstaff:<P>Are you aiming to set a record for the longest string of ad hominem posts in board history?<P>In your quotation, you say it is a suspicion that Verant employees are posting here anonymously in an attempt to skew things, but go no further.  In your explanation, you say you are stating facts, and that anyone with wit would see it.  You choose to characterize my motivation and ability rather than address anything I've said.  Prove your point, rather than assert it.<P>Perhaps it is you who should learn logic and debate.<P>I've addressed each of your points, yet you've addressed none of mine; you simply create more bizarre speculations as to my personal life.  Which is worse than saying nothing, because it tacitly admits to having nothing relevant to add.<P>Still waiting for you to say anything on topic, rather than fantasizing about my life--which is rather strange in itself.<P>Straithlin:<P>You should re-read the thread.  Drazekius began the flames, and I have not addressed anything other than ideas and behaviors, unlike those you defend.  You still fail to distinguish between the ideas and the person, which explains both your hypersensitivity and your inability to see which behaviors are allowed under the rules, and which not.<P>Try harder.  Look at the differences between what is allowed and what not; you'll see the pattern eventually.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
