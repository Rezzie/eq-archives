</FONT><HR>Just wanted to drop in and say a few things.<P>First on the Managirl thing, I know this is very "political" issue with people having strong feelings either way. I didn't write this story for her, I wrote this story cause I like to write. I just felt that the space for my usual second part of the story would be better used to spread awareness of it. I don't ask for you to agree with me, in fact I don't ask anything. I just want to say my piece and give my opinion which I hope everyone here is entitled to agree. I came back today and found 20 different threads on the issue, so I'm happy :P Maybe something will happen and maybe it won't, but I've done what I can.<P>In any case, there's no need to attack anyone here. I know not everyone agrees with me and probably everyone who comes and posts to this board should know that.<P>As for the people who don't feel that the players own the game...I'm sorry. There is a big difference between something like the Final Fantasy series (my favorite one, which I played back when the first american version came out for the original Nintendo system) which tells an amazing story and does a great job of immersing you in a world, and Everquest.<P>In Final Fantasy, as in most RPGs, you can be brought into a world, but it's not your world, it's theirs. And just like Zindane you do a stand in for a while, act on a stage, play a roll...and when the story is good enough and the graphics amazing it feels like you're part of a movie, and that's great. I've loved that since I was eight.<P>That's not Everquest.<P>The programmers in Everquest don't make a world, they paint a backdrop upon which a world evolves. If you want some logical reason I can think of one...Go to Mith Marr and play there, then play the exact same character on Bertox. Those are two different worlds. The backdrop is the same, same pixels and polygons, but the worlds are different. Logically that would tell you that the people must make the worlds.<P>But if you need logic to guide you, you've already missed the point entirely.<P>Verant might own the hardware and copyrights and all, but at the very most you can't argue it's theirs. Just as in any other product in a capitalist democratic society, Verant must cater to the will of the people. Brad is not unlike the President of the US. He might run the show, he can kick people off for writing or saying things, or finding exploits, he could buff Tunare until she was invincible or make her as difficult as a fire beetle. But he's still a person at a company. He has to make money like everyone else. He has to ensure the future profitability of Everquest, so he has to listen to consumers.<P>He's a servant of the people.<P>Right now, at this very instant Alan is probably reading discussion of class threads, dozens of programmers are working to execute OUR ideas. The entire concept of Class Talk Threads shows it's our game.<P>It's our world. I tip my hat to those who made the backdrop, but without us Everquest would be as methodic as a cuckoo clock and as transparent as Velium.<P>Deelit Elementcaller<BR>56 Magician<BR>Bertox</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The truth is the GM's are very inattentive even at the best of times.  This comes from lack of experience, overworking, or just plain lack of caring.<P>I recently ran afoul of GM overworked or lack of caring myself.  I went on a Vox raid and went LD when i tried to get back in I was stuck online but not on.  I spent nearly 40 mins in chat before even getting a response out the GM there and I was beyond frustrated at that point.  I missed the raid which succeeded.  I was stuck in the lair and was absolutely furious at the time.<P>This could been handled much better with more people or at least more attentive people.  I nearly left the game that time I was that unhappy.<P>The managirl things seems similiar except might fall under lack of attention and poor training and hopefully not a power miser but this is possible too.<P>Managirl is the least offensive name I have seen and is kind of cute along with themed if you look at it that way after all she hangs at the beach.  What the GM did was poor judgment at best and I don't agree the name violates naming policy.<P>But anyway you are a gifted writer and if you ever read anything but Lawrence Watt Evans <BR>he writes in similiar very humerous style.<P>Hopefully Verant's service will improve as the game still has great potential.<P>Ironwind Dreamseeker<BR>51st Cavalier of Brell<BR>Lightbringer of Misericordia</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>That was a funny post. It captured my attention for over an hour just reading it. You nailed most of the issues in EQ with a succinct and funny comedy act. Bravo. I also agree with you on the issue of ManaGirl Beachbum. Again this is a totally subjective viewpoint by the GMs. This is fantasy guys. Any two none offensive words should be able to be put together and made into a name. In this case, she was a girl and maybe she gave mana? this is as descriptive as a name can get. Why was she even forced to change it? That to me sounds like the GMs have nothing better to do than harrassing players. Why don't you guys answer some of those other complaints about items missing and accounts being hacked? A player in our guild has been waiting for over 2 weeks for a response on his missing items and He still hasn't got his stuff back. Please set your priorities. This is a fantasy game. Those are fantasy names. If you are changing people's names like ManaGirl, then maybe you should look at your rediculous NPC names like Opal Darkbriar...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The story is great, I've enjoyed them ever since the first one from Veeshan's Peak Found!<P>But I think you're dead wrong on the Managirl issue.<P>"Roleplaying ISNT a must in EQ, Verant has said that before."<P>But it IS supported.  And supporting that means preserving an atmosphere condusive to it.  And names like this ARE out of place and jarring to anyone attempting to roleplay.<P>If you don't like to roleplay, fine, but realize that when you anti-roleplay -publicly-, YOU are creating an environment hostile to roleplaying.  YOU are doing so, not Verant.  YOU are forcing YOUR playstyle on other people.  So don't go getting bent out of shape.  I can turn off ooc with only minor inconveniences like getting slaughtered numerous times by trains that were only announced on that channel.  But I -CANNOT- turn off pc names without it having truly serious gameplay repercussions.  So just get rid of that suggestion, it just ain't playable.<P>Qwinn Windfletcher<BR>51st Ranger<BR>Tunare Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>qwinn, how is a name like ManaGirl Beachbum making the roleplaying enviornment hostil? who decides what "fantasy" is? It is a totally subjective opinion and should be left alone for the most part. How can you dictate what people consider fantasy and not fantasy. Do we all base our names on works by JRR Tolkien? I for one have read more fantasy books than most people and I have heard some rediculous names from authors. So what? did it make the story any less entertaining? No. It is a fantasy world, these are MADE UP names. The fact that ManaGirl Beachbum made her name descriptive suggested that she was trying to roleplay. I don't see the harm in her name and names like that should be kept more so than the typical boring renditions of the name Wolverine done with about 10 thousand different spellings. But alas, thats MY opinion.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Seems to me there is really only one issue about the "Managirl" thing.  Verant can change names; it's their perogative.  But it's damn rude and inconsiderate to just walk up, say 'your name is illegal,' change it to something random, and waltz off.<P>Anybody who plays the game knows that the enforcement of this rule is haphazard, and often impolite.  That should be the real issue.  If Verant wants its name policy obeyed so badly, they need to improve screening in the early stages, and they need to remain courteous to a fault when changing peoples names (Okay, if the guy keeps changing his name to Fartboy 20 times in a row, I can see how a guide or GM might not be so forgiving.  But go easy on them the first time through.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here's the real problem:My topic is nothing new. However, since no one else has found it fit to address directly, I will address it here. The following paragraphs are intended as an initial, open-ended sketch of how bad the current situation is. To say anything else would be a lie. <P>I cannot conceive of any circumstance under which Managirl Beachbum's goals could be considered appropriate. So what's the connection between that and his pranks? The connection is that I'm willing to accept that Managirl has no idea what he's doing. I'm even willing to accept that he is the grand master of obfuscation and misdirection. But if he were as bright as he thinks he is, he'd know that I didn't want to talk about this. I really didn't. But we must reach out to people with the message that his consistent lack of regard for others will change the course of history before the year is over. We must alert people of that. We must educate them. We must inspire them. And we must encourage them to follow through on the critical work that has already begun. A complete description of the problems with Managirl's prank phone calls would occupy several volumes, as if it made any difference. Managirl is addicted to the feeling of power, to the idea of controlling people. Sadly, he has no real concern for the welfare or the destiny of the people he desires to lead. Even as I write those words, I can feel Managirl cringe. That's okay. Cringe. I don't care, because he is capable of only two things, namely whining and underhanded tricks. <P>I have given this issue a great deal of thought, and I now have a strong conviction that of all of his exaggerations and incorrect comparisons, one in particular stands out: "The majority of neo-negligent spongers are heroes, if not saints." I don't know where he came up with this, but his statement is dead wrong. I've received a smattering of mail from people who want to know the real story behind Managirl's dotty excuses, so here it is: All of the bad things that are currently going on are a symptom of Managirl's fork-tongued wisecracks. They are not a cause; they are an effect. <P>Do you understand the implications of what I have been telling you? Are you awake? Then you probably realize that all the deals Managirl makes are strictly one-way. Managirl gets all the rights, and the other party gets all the obligations. <P>He asserts that there is something intellectually provocative in the tired rehashing of yawping stereotypes. Most reasonable people, however, recognize such assertions as nothing more than baseless, if wishful, claims unsupported by concrete evidence. If you agree, read on. Managirl should hide his head in shame before the judgment of future generations, whose tongue it will no longer be possible to stop and which, therefore, will say what today all of us know to be true: Many of Managirl's philosophies have been criticized for being slanted in favor of a particular stance. If, after hearing facts like that, you still believe that Managirl's mistakes are always someone else's fault, then there is decidedly no hope for you. What Managirl Beachbum is doing is akin to painting a mustache on the Mona Lisa. And that's all I have to say.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Fabulous story and essay there. Lots of wisdom there. Huzzah!<P>Verant may own the servers, the software, the NPCs, and the environment in which we play. They thought up this world and the quests we participate in. They own the physical world that is Norrath and in that sense we are in *their* world. <P>The major reason for the success of the world Verant created is the players. We are the ones who breathe life into the world. Each server has a storyline that Verant had very little to do with. Friendships created in game are not the intellectual property of Verant. Each player has a storyline of their own while playing Everquest. You may not own the furnished apartment you live in, but you own the story of your adventures and relationships within that apartment.<P>I believe that fan sites, stories, and spoiler sites contribute to player participation and ultimately Verant's bottom line. Players pick up the slack that Verant doesn't have the resources to do. Once you have explored the world Verant has created, what keeps people coming back is the other players. Norrath is all about social interactions whether they be negative or positive. <P>As for the Managirl incident. I understand she may have violated the letter of the rules, but I would think that the GM would have had a whole queue of things to do rather than deal with a slight naming violation. I would hope that the GM would have dealt with all the resses they had to do and responded to more serious complaints about playability, before confronting Managirl. Everytime I log into the chat server, I hear numerous complaints that there are no GMs to deal with serious issues and hear how overwhelmed GMs are with all the requests they get. Then I hear of a GM doing this. It sounds to me that the GM staff's limited resources would be better served addressing real issues on servers. <P>Rules and guidlines should be written in the spirit of enhancing gameplay and helping everyone on the server cooperate within the world. Rules should protect players from abuse and harrassment. Verant also is within their rights to stop the sale of their pixels for the personal profit of some players. <P>Once rules and guidelines are used to ruin the gaming experience of someone who meant well, then something is horribly wrong. <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"This is our world, because without us Verant is nothing.  They create the backdrop, we are the meat of the world.  THEREFORE, we should be able to dictate the rules of our own world."<P>This is where you are wrong, Deelit, because the world we see as "our" world is only the world created by those closest to us.  Our guild, our friends, our foes - it doesn't matter.  We only make up a small part of the world, a small fraction.  It is because of this that we 1) have authority and 2) respect authority.  Because we do not represent the world.  We are part of it, but we do not represent it.<P>Just because people on this board spams the board with the same issues over and over again does not mean they represent the majority of EQ.  And in any case, the majority should not be used to dictate an issue because the majority does not always do what is best for the community.  They often do what is best for THEM, as a society of the majority, a rule of the Mob, and therefore often supplants the interests of the vast and varied minority groups under them.  Such is history, such it has been repeated, and will probably be repeated again.<P>It is human nature to rebel against authority, because we feel often that we must have the freedom and choice over our own lives, and because we hate being told what to do by others.  Yet this nature is the same nature that drives us to war, prejudice, injustice, and many other vices.  In the name of freedom, atrocities have been committed.  Is the child who was killed in a riot against authority any more free now that he/she has been killed in the name of freedom? I doubt it.<P>Simply stating that we are the people do not mean we hold the power to do whatever we want, because we are NOT the people.  We are the outspoken ones, the ones in EQ who do not abide in silence but rather speak out our minds.  Yet just because WE agree on something, does not mean that it is the voice of the People.  The People is not simply the majority.  The People is also the minority, the varied, the elite and the common, the rich and the poor.  All interests, all dreams, all visions come together to form the People.  We do not have the right to claim that we speak for the People when presently, we disagree with ourselves.<P>"I do not understand the ones who say that we are not the world..."<P>Just because humans inhabit this world, does that make it ours? Did we create this world from the elements of nature by forging our societies and communities? Is whatever force that created this world only our servant?<P>What you refer to as the "world of Everquest", I rather refer to only as the player community.  The player community is a large part of EQ, but it is not the world of EQ.  We are in Verant's world because presently, no matter how we form our communities and societies, we live in their world, we play in their world.  Our communities and societies are subject to their world.  We form our societies, in fact, by the rules of THEIR world.<P>If you made up a society called "Necromancers" in the RL, you would get laughed at.  Yet the community known as Necros or Clerics exist in EQ, not just because we made it, but because Verant made it possible for us to make it.  You make a guild here called Prophecy - it is your guild, your community, but it is within Verant's world.  Would Prophecy exist in the real world without Everquest? It would not.  A similar group might exist, but the guild itself would never have been created.<P>The truth is, we owe alot to Verant.  We can sit here and whine and moan all day, but in the end what have we accomplished? We are the players, sure, but have we existed before the coming of Everquest? No, we sit on our butts and we wait for a company, a pioneer, like Verant to make a game so that we can actually form our little "world" and our little communities.  We pay them money, they give us entertainment.  It's a fair tradeoff as it is, because nobody is forcing you to pay money to Verant.  Verant has to labor long and hard to keep their customer base, yet whenever we feel like it we can simply quit, cut off all relations to this world, and move on.  We contribute to the world, but we have no stake in it.  Verant does.<P>This is the fine art of client-server relationship.  They give us what we want, we pay them money, and we are both happy.  They render us a service, we pay them for it.  Yet there comes a time, much like now, when customers think that they should be the masters of the server because they pay for the server.  Excuse me, but this is totally BS.  We might have paid for their continued maintenance of our world, but we did nothing in its making, we did not labor long and hard to create this world, we did not write the thousands of lines of code.  In short, we did nothing but pay for a service.  This service is rendered, so what more do we deserve?<P>My answer: good customer service and continued expansion, so that we keep paying for this same service.  Other than that, I'm not sure what people want.  You certainly can't own Everquest simply because you paid for it or forged a community in it.  In all accounts, communities transcend Everquest, and when all is dust and gone, EQ will be a memory and friends will remain friends.  Our communities will live on, but Everquest will not.  That is the difference of the "world" and the "community".  We are a part of community, but merely dwells "ontop" of the world.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"One day, all the servers could go playerless, and we would move on but Verant employees would have no jobs.  Whose world is it?"<P>If Verant shut down the game & created a new game, they would have a whole new world.  Everquest as a world would fail to exist.  Whose world is it again?<P>Just because the users can renounce the server does not mean the server exists any less.  We maintain Everquest, it is true, but our vision of what Everquest is is in fact the player community of Everquest.  That isn't the world of Everquest.  Brad can run a simulation of EQ with Gordon and they'd have Everquest, the world, all up and running between them.  It is the world of Everquest, with only two people playing, but it's the world nevertheless.  Our community should never be mistaken for our world.<P>This is a common mistake among capitalist societies.  The customers think they deserve everything the servers give them, when in actuality they are as much at the whims and wills of the server as the server are at their whims and wills.  When you buy a car the car is yours.  When you buy Everquest, you do not own the world, you merely own the right to exist within it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>That's a mere difference in opinion Etadanik. I'm viewing it as a whole, as the ungodly amount of entities currently playing the game, powergamers, normal players or whomever. versus those who claim to own it. Sure they could create their own server and drop all others, and they would own it, because they are the players. Both sides need each other, but if you look at the IDEA behind games as a whole, you'll see that the developer needs the gamers more. Why? Because the developer is trying to entertain, they WANT to make these people happy. These people didn't ask to be happy. These people didn't ask directly for this entertainment, and don't NEED this entertainment (some may argue addiction on this  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">), but the people enjoy the entertainment anyways. The developer, on the other hand, NEEDS these people. I believe i stated earlier that if all players quit (i'm not suggesting, just mentioning, mind you, i love the game), then the developers would be at a loss. Everquest would still BE there, but there would be no consumer, so they are at a loss. Games can come and go for a consumer, and they will probably disregard them. For the developer, the game cannot go, or they are out of a job =). <BR>        Perhaps I confused my point, and I've certainly strung out on a tangent. I Guarantee that if the developers were the ONLY Gm's/Gods (as in most MUDs), that gm service would be extraordinary (supposing it had that same rate of communication, obviously not possible). The current GMs just dont care. They know that no one will complain too much to the company, and their job is secure whether they are nice, or whether they could care less about the players. Developers depend on players, unfortunetly the GM who changed the name obviously did not. Some people seem to want to side with the naming policy, for what purpose? To justify someone's reasoning whom you do not even know? What if he deemed your name inappropriate and changed it in the blink of an eye and didn't speak to you again? Would you tell us all about how it was for the better of the game? The naming policy is the least of the concerns and outcry, it is the current condition of the GM service on our servers, which I have been dealing with for near to 2 years (beta 3). I must say I enjoyed beta testing 100 times more, due to extravagent customer service. <BR>     To sum it up, I'm hoping this escapade over a mere name (to some, to others much more) will be a key to the developer that they need to up the notch on their customer service. Im' sure you can all remember being given a work report by a boss, and having him grade you on how well you do it. Do you think GM's are judged the same? Sadly this is the type of thread never addressed by the voices of Verant. I guarantee it will be read. I guarantee that Brad has read about poor Managirl and immeadiatly told everyone to avoid contact at all costs. Sadly it is the way American business works.<BR>           Achazael Hammerfall<BR>                   of<BR>Rallos Zek (home of the most loving of GM's)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If you guys think this is funny, you should check out some of Pirotes' other posts  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> They're probably at EQ parody sites somewhere.<P>As for Rallos' response, I agree with you.  However, what you look as merely opinion I see as more than that.  Pirotes' opinion isn't any different than some other players', but her opinion carries alot more weight because it makes sense.  In the end, everything but blatant facts are opinions, and it is those that make sense that ultimately determines how we see things.<P>The players do not run Everquest, and the fact is they can't run Everquest.  We need Verant as much as Verant needs us.  Here is where our opinions obviously disassociate.  My opinion bases itself on the fact that we as players should learn to APPRECIATE Verant's work, even if they are blatant attempts at money making, they at least have achieved something great that others have not.  Your opinion bases itself on the precept that the players are the basis for Verant's success.  My counter for that is quite simply: if the game wasn't good, why would the players support it? And that's exactly why I think we should recognize the balance between consumer and server.  We both need each other and by maintaining the margin of supply & demand between us we can exist in harmony rather than daily antagonism.  This is especially to those who question Verant's right to govern their own game.  Sure, they're entertainers, but THEY have the right to decide what kind of entertainment they offer.  We the players, if we are to defend actual freedom, must learn not to compromise Verant's freedom to do whatever they want with their own game.  Remember, THEY are people too and they don't HAVE to entertain us.  We influence the direction of the changes by offering our money or taking it away from them.  But outside that, we really have no right to Verant's world.  We do not buy the copyright to Everquest by paying to play it.  That's the point I'm trying to get across, and the point many players are forgetting in their hysteria over how the Managirl situation was dealt with.<P>Yes, it was the GM's fault for doing bad customer service, but outside petitions and quitting our accounts, we have got nothing on Verant.  Players who criticize Verant as a whole forget that it is Verant that brought the game to us.  We have every right to complain, but we must never forget that it is their game, they have labored hard and long to craft it, and in the end this is their creation and they are lending it to us for a price.  How can we sit here and tell Verant that it's now our game and they should appease us when we had no stake in its creation outside populating it(which is, in the end, only a part of EQ)? <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>nice post deelit, i agree with your stance on the mana girl thing, i dont think the name was hurting anyone and sometimes its kinda fun i think to wander into someone with a funny name. i remember to this day back wheni was very young (which was before abouy 90% of you oh so wise in the way of eq'ers started playing) i saw a troll's corpse named meatwagon out front of neriak and i almost died laughing at the sheer dumb trollness of the name. some names are pretty bad, but for the harmless ones sometimes they might add some little bit of humor or a smile to someone's face who runs across them. i used to have a little halfling warrior named asslingwyrm (now changed) and everytime i would shout in a zone for some reason or other the whole zone would erupt laughing. sometimes people in my guild still joke about the fate of poor little asslingwyrm, but the point it is was one of those little funny things that can really brighten some people's day<P>i dont see what rebelling against authority etc all has to do with this. i think some of you really forget what exactly eq IS. its a GAME, we pay to play the software and for th service they provide for ONE SIMPLE REASON ... to have fun. the rules arent there as granite markers of what is to be or not to be. they are simply guidelines to ensure that someone's idea of fun doesnt offend someone else or ruin someone else's game time. i think a lot of you who are going into your complex discussions of human nature, as well as many verant gms and guides are forgetting this simple thing.<P>gms are there and paid for one reason, to help customers who have problems, and to maintain a clean, non offensive and fun environment. <P>(story time=p) i was in solb and there was a conflict over a ragefire spawn between my guild and another. it wasnt to the point of swearing, not once the entire time was there a kill steal or even an attempt of it, in fact at the time the gms were called there were a coupleof us from both sides in a group talking the matter out, and the gm came (guide actually) and forced a roll with the threat of /killing the spawn if we didnt, which we did and then continued our talk. then the guide said that the looser had sch and such time to leave the zone for the rest of the day. well as turns out my guild won and despite the roll agreed to let the other guild have the spawn. we were then ordered to leave the zone.i dumbfounded asked why if we were being banned from the zone for the whole day, the answer was yes (and here we are gettin to the moral of this lengthy thing) still confused, i asked why i was being banned from a zone, when i had done nothing wrong or against verant's rules and hadnt even asked them to come settle the dispute. the answer i got quite frankly appalled me. whathe told me was, in taking a long time to try to talk it out, and having him show up there we were wasting verant customer service's time that they could be doing other things, and the risk that we stayed in the ZONE might cause petitions and waste more of their time. so in essance we were being kicked out of the zone for a day for having done nothing wrong but "waste their time"<P>i was kind of under the impression its things like this i paid to even have a customer service staff for. since when is it a waste of time for CUSTOMER SERVICE to perform service for the customers? thats the whole point of half these people's argument agreeing with this name change, its not about them, its about us. if you ask smed why everquest was created i am sure he would go into some speel about making a fun game ppl would enjoy to play etc etc, not creating their world and forcing us to take the roles they want us into it. yet time and time again their paid gm's try to force us into the roles they want us to.<P>right now the whole mmorpg market is starting to expand, and suddenly they are starting to make some LONG awaited and called for fixes (not uber buffs) but examples being things like the exp class penalty, looking into some real problems certain classes might have, fixing some zones they made into something players really didnt want etc.<P>hell talk about real rules. go to a resaurant and order a steak, get it and you dont like it, well when you complain they dont tell you to deal with it, they make it how you want it. because you are not obligated to patronize their resturant, its a service they WANt you to, so they will try to make you happy as long as you arent infringing on the other customers. they arent trying to force feed you THEIR steak, but making it how you want it. if you have a waiter who is rude to you and wont fix your steak, they probably will not be a waiter there very much longer. gm's are not the "leaders" they are the extension of verant's customer service, PAID employees. yet in many of my experiences they are the ones acting like they paid for us to play their game.<P>as far as i am concerned it is more than just this simple name change that is wrong, it si the whole way this is being run. a lot of vellious was designed how verant wanted the game to be played, not how most of the game population wanted to play the game. that is pretty appearant with a lot of these rather extensive changes they have been making to it since its release. some gm's are really nice and more than willing to help if they can and be polite about it if they cannot. when my little warrior got his name changed the gm who did it was the server admin, vaylin. he didnt randomly toss me out some name of his choosing, he told me it wasnt appropriate, hehe i still think it shoulda been left but im not bitter cause of the way it was handled, he then told me it would have to be changed and soon, and told me i could have a little bit to come up with a different name i would like. so i thought about it a bit, asked some friends for advice and chose a name, end of story. it was probably one that was much more readily taken as offensive if someone read it in the wrong connotation as opposed to beachbum, yet mine was handled in a MUCH more profession much better customer friendly way.<P>if the gm here had taken the time and had at least the semblance of giving a s%#$ and leting miss beachbum know of the problem and take some time to come up with something she might like instead (not that i think it even NEEDEd to be changed) this probably wouldnt even be an issue.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/054863-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/054863.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/054863-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/054863-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=054863&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=054863&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
