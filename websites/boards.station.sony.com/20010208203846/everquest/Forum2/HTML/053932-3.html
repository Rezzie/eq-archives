</FONT><HR>sargus:<P>***These are my thoughts and I could be completely wrong****<P>My thoughts behind the re-start of Ebay is that no one is policing it.  <P>Ebay took the auctions down initially because of the request from Verant.  They no longer offer an Everquest category of auctions.  However people can post auctions in the General sections and use EverQuest in the title.  These auctions then show up in a search.<P>Ebay has realized that legally they have no obligation to remove the auctions but did it just to appease Sony.  But they are not going to spend their resources tracking these auctions down.  If Sony or the EQ players want the auctions gone it will be Sony's and the Anti_Ebay player's responsibility to e-mail any EverQuest URLs to Ebay and ask for their removal.<P><BR>Those are my thoughts...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is largely a cut&paste from another post of mine, but I don't feel like rehashing the first part. It's in reference to EULA's and shrink-wrap license agreements.<P>http://www.avault.com/articles/getarticle.asp?name=eulapt2<P>Adrenaline Vault article about a Washington Supreme court decision:<P>http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=wa&vol=677964maj&invol=1<P>...in which the court ruled in favor of the software company because the construction company knew of the terms of the EULA. Much like EQ players being well aware of Verant/Sony's terms.<BR>                        http://www.law.emory.edu/7circuit/june96/96-1139.html<P>1996 court case of ProCD v. Zeidenberg. Software company sued Zeidenberg for using a database which they owned (much like verant owning everything on or about your character), for his own "for pay" website. Again, much like ebayers selling software, bit and bytes of info, that they do not own, for their own profit.<P>Precident has been set.<P>These precedents are upheld by article 2-606 (of the UCC) which defines acceptance:<P>http://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-606.html<P>(1) Acceptance of goods occurs when the buyer <P>(a) after a reasonable opportunity to inspect the goods signifies to the seller that the goods are conforming or that he will take or retain them in spite of their non-conformity; or <P>(b) fails to make an effective rejection (subsection (1) of Section 2-602), but such acceptance does not occur until the buyer has had a reasonable opportunity to inspect them; or <P>(c) does any act inconsistent with the seller's ownership; but if such act is wrongful as against the seller it is an acceptance only if ratified by him.<P>You could claim "I didn't know!" but courts don't take ignorance as an excuse.

</FONT><HR>Sargus,<BR>There are two possibilities at work on the ebay issue.  First one, Ebay is still removing those eq auctions but at a slower rate. Why? Maybe short on resource, maybe something else.  Second one, they've contacted their lawyers, and find Verant's claims have no ground. So, unless Verant can get a court order, they will let people sell their time for now. Or both of these two possibilities are working at same time.<P>Scirocco,<BR>A lot of people think what Verant have said are laws. They think once they have agreed to something on paper, then they have have to follow it.  People have to realize that a legal contract offers equal protection to all the parties involved.  If a contract that failed to offer the equal protection, then it can be disputed in court.  If court rules on the contract as illegal contract, then nobody have to keep follow the contract.  An illegal document has no legal binding power.  It is like if you signed a paper which allow another person to kill you, but after you have been killed, the person who killed you will still go to jail.  It is not a legal contract.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This question may be *slightly* off the beaten track, but what are people's problems with others buying items off eBay?  Vertant has itself said in the past that the problem they have with the selling of properties that exist within game is the possibility of fraud, and the possibility that this fraud (for example, auctioning an FBSS and then not delivering it to the winning bidder) could be laid at their doorstep with potential legal penalties to Verant.  In fact, it has been stated in the past that were there a SECURE method of doing this, they would have no problem with it.  This would be difficult without Verant itself programming a method by which an auctioned item would be placed into some sort of online escrow, which would then be transferred to the winning bidder of the auction upon proof of payment (a statement to that effect by the seller would probably be sufficient), with perhaps an additional $5 a month payed by the sellers/buyers in order to access this kind of service (so that Verant would profit).<P>My question, again, is what are the players' problems?  The best items in the game are NODROP and therefore not able to be transferred, so the best items aren't going to be sold or given away.  Do the people who have a problem with the selling of items also have a problem with someone GIVING items away?  I myself have been given several very good weapons and armor either because I gave some service (in the form of help or my very entertaining roleplaying  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ) or because the item in question was a LORE item and therefore they wanted to be able to pick up the next one (an example of this would be a high-level person hunting in Velious who comes back to their "home" newbie area to hand a random low-level person a walrus tooth, which happened to me).  How would this be different, in gameplay effect, from someone buying an item on eBay?  And is this something people are also against?<P>In my mind, if there were no NODROP items in the game, this would be a much bigger player concern.  The fact that there ARE items which cannot be traded between players means that lower-level characters are expected to be able to obtain (given the proper amount of plat, helping, roleplaying, etc.) high-level items that are able to be transferred.<P>Just something y'all might want to think about.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>  What happens when someone buys a character and equips it from ebay and then Verant shuts down the servers 10 days later?  I could certainly see a series of lawsuits arising especially if Verant had made no effort to discourage it.  What happens when money exchanges hands and a trade is made, then there is a server rollback.  I may have lost an expensive item because of a Verant screwup.  There are lots of scenarios like this that force Sony/VI to take the stance they have just to protect themselves.  If they do not go after auctions then when the day comes to shut the servers down they will face a horde of lawsuits (which they will win) reguarding the nature of persistant worlds and the loss of monetary investments in a supposed persistant world.<P>  What about ebay guilds that tie up a whole series of spawns for months at a time.  EBay allows one set of players to profit while restricting another group of players access to items and mobs.  They must also take a stand against auctions as an attempt to provide equal access for all of their players.  Sure it will never happen but they must try, otherwise they disservice their player base.<P>Just my thoughts...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>tortcat<BR>Looks like ebay asking Verant to give a reason to remove each and every auctions.  Verant cannot say remove them all because all those auctions are illegal.  Also, Verant cannot sue those who are posting auction today.  Why? Because the Equal Protection Clause stated that there can be no selective prosecution.  So, Verant have to sue every single person who sold/bought/bid on the EQ related auctions.  How many lawyers do think Verant got?  Also, if they do that, it will pretty much means the death of EQ.  There were around 4000 closed auctions on ebay per week for nearly 2 years.  The number of people involved is nothing less scary.  After they banned all of them, Verant will find they have banned the very core of people that they want to keep.  Chain reaction of the lawsuites and banning would be so big and will render the end of whole company future.  Just to think about it is making me fell the chill.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Chief Wahoo, that is a clever twist...LOL!<P>My main point is this thread has been to throw water on the notion that selling "items" on ebay somehow involves a violation of copyright.  It's a breach of contract issue, something entirely different.  <P>&gt;&gt;kinda looks like they will let auctions stay up unless VI examines each and every auction??<P>Yes, that pretty much is it.  That's because, in general, an auction to transfer an item on an EQ server from one account to another for cash (which is all that is happening) doesn't infringe on any copyrights.  An auction with a screenshot from the game may infringe, but only because of the screenshot.<P>Sony obviously tried to lean on ebay last week, playing Goliath to ebay's David.

</FONT><HR>Chief_Wahoo,<P>"Sony is not losing the rights nor ownership nor ablitily to profit from their property. "<P>False.<P>  Every minute you have to camp an item yourself, is a minute longer they keep you as a PAYING CUSTOMER.<P>  By paying someone else for camping the item for you, that's money, in the long-run, that Verant/Sony could have billed you for, as it would logically have taken you that much longer to camp the items you wanted for yourself, rather than leveling.<P>  Presented another way:  While you are camping one item, you are paying someone else in real $$$ to camp a second item for you, and thus halving (cutting in half) the amount of time you'd be associated with EQ, and thus reducing Verant/Sony's own net income from charging you a monthly fee.  You might max out on items, get sick of the game, and move on, whereas if you'd had to camp your own items all the way through, you MIGHT have stayed with EQ a few more months... that's money out of Verant's/Sony's pockets.  That's why Verant and Sony are working to get these things stopped, that's why it's a violation of law.  By eBaying items for real $$$, you are in effect selling time that rightfully belongs to Verant, and is theirs to sell.<P>Long and short, it's their intellectual property, and as long as you are on their servers to use their property, they make the rules, violating those rules is a violation of the EULA, violating the EULA (no matter how poorly worded it is) is the same as violating a signed agreement (you click "I agree" every time you play).  Violating a signed agreement is against the law, and by providing you with a place in which you can profit for breaking the law, eBay and the likes are in legal jeopardy, THAT is why the Feds are involved, that is why eBay and the likes are best off not allowing ANY EQ items sales on their sites, and that is why eBay farmers are in serious jeopardy of going to jail or at least paying fines.<P>eBay at your own risk.<P>Rooke</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Rooke_LL<BR>Do you know why many people willing start to play EQ nowdays?  For many people, eQ is a fun game is one reason they start new, the other reason is that they know they can buy items/pp/account for their newly started characters.  This means easy start for them.  Many will say those people should work for their characters and items.  However, why should they consider your value in first place?  Each person can make and should make decision on their own.  If they got the money and think it is worth it to spent real life money on game stuff, then so be it.  If people worry about they will lose their chance to obtain the items that are being sold on ebay.  Well, if you strong enough in game, then you will be able to get the item.  Remember the PnP?  Verant designed the item drop system, cannot transfer the problem to the people who camp it.  If there are 4000 people want an item in game, then there will be 4000 people to camp it.  The chance for you to get will not change much whether there are 4000 people camping it or one person camping it for 4000 people.  Actually, your chance of getting an item will increase when less people camping it.  Why? Because those people have to eat and sleep!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The 4000 people that want it... most of them have more of a normal life.  In short, they eat, sleep, or just log to do real life things more often.  In short, greater chance of getting in for you.<P>Second, those 4000 people move through.  They get it, they don't come back.  The farmer returns again and again.<P>The 4000 people don't really care who gets the item.  The farmer profits by it being rare.  If the only way to get it is through him, then the price goes up.

</FONT><HR>Why does the camper comes back to camp the item more?  Because when the first 4000 people got what they wanted, another 4000 people will kick in.  So, let's a camp is 2 hour for every item droped.  4000 people = 8000 hours.  The possibilites for 4000 people to fill a 24 hours day is &gt; than the possiblilites for 200 people to fill a 24 hours day.  You as the 1 person who want the same item just like the other 4000 people.  Tell me if you want to take the chance when there are 4000 people camping or the 200 people camping?  Remember, there is a limite for a person to keep doing something none stop.  Certain campers can last pretty long without sleep or eatting.  However, they cannot last as long as 4000 people taking turns.  Remember, the total number of characters need one popular item will not change.  It is just matter of how many people are camping the item at same time.  You want to take on 1 in 4000 or 1 in 200?  I will take 1 in 200. hehe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Interested bunch of arguments....<BR>To Ixsamael: [at 99.9% percent totally in agreement with Scirocco]<P>Given you are a law student I am surprised out how simple you believe this situation to be, but be that as it may:<P>1) Things do not only make it into the public domain by an deliberate act on the part of the owner of the copyright.  A good lawyer in this field should be warning customers that their action smight place something into the public domain.  I can't be bothered in blast the pages of text covering this subject on to this site, but I suggest you study it if this is the area you are going into.<P>2) Copyright protection DOES NOT stop you from selling an item legally obtained from the owner of the copyright, it does prohibit you from making copies or derivate works.  If I buy a painting I can not copy it but I can sell it.<P>3) The contract [EULA] is expressly grants rights to you the user.  Under these rights you are allowed to use the game, among other things.  the EULA does not specify whether you are able to copy the material in the game.  One assume that you can do so for personal use or at least "fair use".  It would be nice if they were a tad more specific in this regards, they do prohibit copy of the printed material.  One would hope it is ok to print the electronic material, such as the new manual -- fair use?<P>4) There are a number of sites making money from using copyrighted material -- all the info sites for instance through advertizing.  The material is everywhere.  It is on 1000s of web sites -- it is getting very close to being considered in the public domain.  I think Sony would have a hard time telling someone a screen shot on a web site is a violation of copyright at this point.  But who knows, they might prevale.<P>In the end we have two valid questions.  Can someone make a living through using the system as described in the EULA?  I am not enough of a USA lawyer to know they answer, but California is very big on "restriction of trade", they would have to prove that their business is being damaged to get a "cease and desist" order from a court.<P>In the end what is an Ebayer selling?  It can only be one thing in the case of an item:<P>"If you give $50 I will move my character to the bank in xxx and cause your trade window to activate by taking my xxx item and clicking on your characters body.  Once this is done you may click trade and get this item."<P>You are paying them to take certain actions in EQ, none of which is illegal.  And Sonytrying to block you from making money in this way may be "restriction of trade" in California.<P>For instance, you can by a game of monopoly [or not] and charge people $20 per hour to treach them how to play monopoly.  There is nothing illegal about this.<P>So, if Sony wants to stop this they need to change the game or the environment.  I still think Sony should consider selling the stuff themselves and using the money to make it a better game, that would kill the black market on EBay.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Cheif in your example yes you could be proscecuted for fraud especially if you sold me the time and your agreement said you could not.  Not claiming ownership does nothing.  The court will see clearly that you were selling something that you do not own.  Claiming that you are selling something else does not make it true.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I don't' think Sony/Verant ever intended to actually stop anything. <P>Originally the only reason they took a stance against Ebay (pre-recent Ebay stoppage)was to give them a easy out when players were unhappy/ripped off on Ebay deals. You can't waste their time and money complaining about being ripped off on Ebay if you wasn't supposed to be on Ebay to start with. They never even bothered to ban accounts that were sold 100 times (the buyer changes account info and CC info) unless someone complained. The moment there are complaints on a sold account then the account is burning Verant's $$ in CSupport and then, and only then, it was banned (for being sold). Basically they did not want time/money going to paying GM/tech support to deal with Ebay issues "WAAAAA ! So and so screwed me ! I got scammed ! Help me get my stuff back ! etc... etc..."  UO does support Ebaying items and they pay for it in support and petitions. <P>So why the sudden decision to shut down Ebay ? I think it was just so they can say "look, we tried really really hard !"  <P>I don't think Verant/Sony will push any harder then they need to in order to make it 'look' like they tried "player perception is all that counts". That just seems typical of Verant... maybe I'm wrong.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>MoonspiritFrostrose:<P>Just to let you know you only need to declare other income if it's greater than $1000 (or maybe $700 I forget which).  I would guess most people selling stuff on Ebay do it casually when they get a decent item they really don't need and their friends already have it.  Probably only 5% of the people who have sold things on Ebay do it "as a living".  The rest are probably the occasional seller that won't make over $1000 in a year.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Actually there is a simple backdoor for Sony to shut down Ebayers....Cancel the accounts in question.  Person A 'violates' TOS of VI by selling character to person B for X$'s...VI, invoking TOS cancels the account.  Person B sues Person A for damages and whatever else may be there legally.  People have to remember they're selling something they don't own and have no title to.  Person A knew it violated TOS when he sold to person B so person A would be, by account of law, Liable for any losses incurred by person B.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053932-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053932.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053932-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053932-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053932-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053932&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053932&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
