</FONT><HR>Jamesro<P>Your argument falls apart if you consider that most twinkers, twink clases different than their original.(based on observation and that it makes little sense to twink the same class you have already played.) A warrior has a twink mage, a Necro a twink druid etc. So there are no real "handmedowns". <P>If anything twinking has created more high levels camping things they can't use for their own, or their guilds, twinks than it ever saved in twinks not camping loot. Besides most twinks I encounter want loot just to sell it for plat. ( or maybe ebay.)<P>If you have an item you can't use just destroy it, or run a quick newbie event and give it to the winner.( one item won't make him/her a twink.) Their are better ways to help the economy than to make a cheating spoiled brat character.

</FONT><HR>Twinking is only really bad on PvP servers (IMHO).  It makes it really hard for someone to get that first character going on PvP because almost everyone twinks, and then PK the untwinked.  <P>As far as twinking  on blue servers, I don't like it, but I don't care if you do it.  If someone doesn't enjoy the lower levels and wants to race through them, what do I care?  <P>I personally do enjoy the lower levels, and I prefer to earn the stuff I get rather than just start with the best stuff.

I'm seeing the 37 warrior who prevented me from gnoll hunting in HH last weekend.(I can now only play on weekends)This person openly admitted they were camping PGT for guild twinks. Your seeing your freinds. Who's got the tunnel vision is anyones guess. <P>No, I don't want a game based on real life; at least not in as much as cheaters get away with unearned advantages because of powerful freinds or themselves being powerful in an unrelated character er...

That doesn't make twinker item farming, twink kill stealing or any of the other valid arguments against twinking any less valid unless you can prove they don't exist, which is a logical impossiblilty.

</FONT><HR>Vald, I twink because I want to play with the cool toys.  I enjoy traveling around the land and hunting for new cool stuff.  If I happen to get some of that new cool stuff in my travels I want to play with it.  I dont want to take the stuff and sell it, I want to either give it to my friends who need it, or create a new character to play with it.  I created a warrior because I was able to get ahold of a practice sword and I was doing the Crafted Quest for xp, I thought that was the perfect oportunity to play.  I am not a big fan of sitting around auctioning, so I gave away a few of the duplicate pieces to a couple random newbies, and created a level 1 wood elf with armor that was mostly crafted and a little bit of bronze, gave him my PGT I had been carrying around ever since I got to 25 and had my Gnoll Hide Lariats kick in, and my CDS I have had ever since I got dual wield and didnt need.  Overall I have been very happy with this, the warrior allows me a way to spend a little bit of that time when I just dont feel like playing my primary character, and it allowed me to meet new people, who have become friends, seen new things, and get new members to my guild.<P>What I dont understand is how this effects anyone else, sure a level 37 hunting camping the gnolls in HH is kinda annoying, but I am sure u were able to fight the other gnolls, and if u got into trouble he probally helped you out.  What is wrong with wanting a new toy.  That is why I like Kunark, you dont have to sit in one spot and stare at a wall for those cool toys, you just have to hunt in an area and sometimes they just well, drop.  The flaw in the game is camping loots.  Players actually wanting to USE the EQ that they find in the game are not the problem.  I find I get more enjoyment playing with new toys then selling em, so what?  Why shouldnt I be able to see what it is like to have Magical Skin protecting you from attacks just because I happen to be a Shaman?  I want to see how cool that really is.  Most of the good stuff with procs have level restraints (like that PGT), so I still had to get to 10 to use it.<P>So basically, my opinion of this is that this game is made to HAVE FUN.  Part of how I have fun is in playing with new toys, meeting new people, doing new things.  I think it is fun to twink up a level 5 warrior and see if I can take out that level 10 necro in the Hills (got my but whiped, but it was still fun).  If that doesnt float your boat, then dont do it, but why does it bother you that I am having fun with it?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>You know, these anti-twink threads are really redundant and I see why Verant doesn't comment on them.<P>Anti-twink: "Twinking reduces my enjoyment of the game, and is cheating"<BR>Twinker: "You're just jealous"<BR>Anti-twink: "Am not"<BR>Twinker: "Are So"<BR>Anti-twink: "Your momma"<P>That about sums up the comments on the last 2 pages.  All I can say is that twinking is a way of giving characters stuff that they haven't earned in game.  Earning items in game is an integral part of the gameplay experience and when you bypass it you open up a Pandora's box  of problems.  Monsters are no longer balanced because level one chars are wearing Mithril and carrying Yaks. The economy then collapses from the bottom up. Have you tried selling under level 20 stuff lately??  I'll give you a clue, no one buys it because they're all twinked.  Equipment that used to be valuable to level 1-20 chars (i.e., a Shiny Brass Halberd) can't be given away nowadays.  And that trend is just going to get worse to the point where people don't buy and sell anything under level 50 items because everyone is twinked.  And finally, twinking makes it makes it harder for Verant to get new customers to play the game because they're competing on a totally non-level playing field.  And for those of you that think this is just jealousy then I would say you have forgotten what it's like to play a naked level one character.  Try playing from the start with nothing, while all of these twinked out level one characters run around KS'ing you and being invulnerable to everything.  It ain't a lot of fun...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I don't know what server you're on but if everyone with nicer equipment than yourself is treating you like a red-headed stepchild, I'd move to another server.<P>Twinks also aren't invulnerable. Bards die alot. Particularly half elven bards in WC. (Say Gix!)<P>Perhaps I play for a different reason. My lvl 11 bard is almost always solo. Why? He's my de-stressing character. When I'm tired of the upper level stress of doing CR deep into dungeons or waiting for the clerics to relog in Hate, I like to slap around Pumas, bear, and spiders... oh my.<P>I die, I go back and start again.

</FONT><HR>Vard that's too funny.<P>You tell me how it's cheating. Twinking is accepted and there are no rules against it anywhere in the FAQ, EULA, Constitution, or any other written doctrine on the planet.<P>So it's a moral issue for you.<P>I can't think of how many times I've discredited your argument and arguments like yours. You're saying "it's not right."

The equipment stays under one owner. Much like a collector of pennies doesn't ruin the US economy by a sudden loss of pennies around the country."<P>You say: "Twinks are KSers."<P>I say: "No. Some Players are KSers.

I got a whole 3 bracelets of woven grass from the deal. I was bored."<P>You say: "Farmers tank my camp."<P>I say: "Again, that's a rude player taking your camp."<P>Vard, it's your argument that is weak.

</FONT><HR>Apollo:<P>You guys keep saying, "we all started naked at level one some time."  Of course we all started that way once.  That's not the point at all.  Read the topic.  We're talking about twinking characters, hence, taking stuff you earned on another character and giving it to a new lower level character.  We're not debating that once, at some point, you earned the equipment.  Fine, good for you.  You earned it on one character.  That doesn't give you the right to transfer it to a new character.  That's called twinking and is against Verant's vision for the game.<P>Secondly, everyone jumped all over the fact that I said  people who are twinked can easily KS.  Fine, nitpick all you want.  Again, the point wasn't that people KS right and left.  The point was that it is inherently unbalanced for Joe Shmoe who buys the game to start with a naked level 1 character and you have a twinked level 1 running around in Mithril that can't be hit by any monsters of his level.  Regardless of the way in which that imbalance manifests itself (ks'ing, taunting, dueling, jealousy, etc.) it's imbalanced nonetheless.  The game was not designed so that characters would start out with level 30+ armor and weapons.  It means that every element of combat is thrown out of whack, from the risk vs reward levels, to the quests, to the economy, to the player and social interaction.  Trust me, I have played a twinked and a non-twinked character and if you can't tell the difference in how it affects gameplay then you're being a fool.<P>As for the economy, you're dead wrong if you think that twinking characters doesn't completely screw it up.  As an example, on Mith Marr recently I wanted to sell some weapons that I didn't need anymore.  I had a Shiny Brass Halberd, a Bone Bladed Claymore, and a Barbed Leather Whip. I used each in combat from levels 1-25 and they all worked great.  When I purchased them they were also 150p+ each.  Now, I do realize that all items in the game will decrease in value if the market is flooded with them.  That's not the point.  The FACT is that I wandered around Freeport for a WEEK and I couldn't GIVE these weapons away.  Do you know why??  Because every single level 1-15 character I talked to already had weapons that were better than those.  So how can you tell me that twinking characters doesn't ruin the economy from the bottom up, when 99% of the characters coming in to the world don't want to buy low level stuff anymore because they're twinked?? Huh??</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Yogi, I've come to expect nothing less than troll-like responses from you. Nothing more to say on that part. On to the people that manage to think...<P>Tanr, I have no idea what you said.<P>Kidf, here's what the FAQ says about twinking:<P>"As game designers, we are aware that players seek any advantage available in order to get a "leg up". It has been the nature of massively- multiplayer games since their earliest manifestation. It is with this in mind that EverQuest was built. Since we recognize the issue, that being that people will always desire to "pass down" items from higher-level characters to lower-level characters, we chose to remain more or less neutral on the subject as long as it doesn't unbalance the game."<P>So with that in mind, it's NOT against the Vision (TM). So since it's my character and Verant is well aware that it happens, it IS my right to do so.<P>You're being a fool if you think that everyone that puts armor on a twink is invulnerable. Put Crafted on a lvl one warrior and sit him in front of a Dervish. Please report back after you retrieve the corpse. And No all twinkers aren't KSing. That's just an exaggeration you and many others use to attempt to make a point.<P>As far as that lame equipment you were attempting to sell, Can I remind you that Kunark came out since those weapons were placed in the game?<P>Please think about things a bit more. Your argument on the economy still hasn't been justified.<P>I'm outtie for the day folks!<P>Adios!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>personally i think they(verant ) have encouraged it at the higher lvls with the forced grouping stance and the seeming imbalance at the lvl 50 plus lvls. IE the majority of ranger i know who quit have twinked and powerlvled lots of warriors, chanters etc. Personanly i believe that these players wouldnt have twinked and changed characters if the imbalance didnt exist.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I don't have any level 50+ chars.  Two 35's are my highest so far.<P>I have twinked my lower levels, and will continue to twink them.  Makes playing them much more fun.<P>I either pass down items the higher levels can no longer use, or give them money the higher levels have earned.<P>I don't use e-bay.  That is the epitome of stupid.  Paying RL money on a character.<P>I don't care if the anti-twinkers are jealous or not.  I don't care if they can't see twinking as RP or not.  I can.  My Necro or Warrior has some relantionship with my lower level and is happy to help the other out.<P>Then again, the server I'm on people tend to just pass out higher level stuff as it is, it's an older server.  Someone, a total stranger, gave my lower level a very nice cloak simply because he didn't want to bother with auctioning it.  <P>So, twinking happens.  <P>You can RP and twink in this and in other games like: AD&D, Rifts, Shadowrun, Gurps etc etc etc.  Those are all RPG's right?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Apollo, there have been MANY official posts which state that twinking is against the vision, and picking one small area from the FAQ and using that to make your point is laughable.<P>Secondly, I didn't say that putting on armor makes you invulnerable.  I said, "can't be hit by any monsters of his level."  OF HIS LEVEL.  If all you can do is nitpick semantics when you know perfectly well what I meant then you're not worth talking to.  Of course a level 1 in Mithril can't fight a dragon.  And I NEVER said all twinkers were KS'ing.  Again, you're taking one thing out of context to make your point and you're obviously not listening what I'm saying.<P>Lastly, you're telling me that a BBC, Shiny Brass Halberd, and Barbed Leather Whip are so "lame" that even a level 1 character in FP coudn't use them??  What does Kunark have to do with it?  Once again, you're not reading my posts.  I said I COULDN'T GIVE THEM AWAY TO NEWBIE'S IN FREEPORT BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL TWINKED.  I didn't say there weren't better weapons available in the game.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Because I hate my Necromancer that I played to 51. He got boring, and it just got to be a chore. I need to be more active in my character.<P>I traded all the good stuff I got as a Necro for the Bard items. The rest of it...I camped...I Farmed if you wish to call it that.<P>Did I hurt anyone? Nope. Not ONCE was I asked about my camps. Not ONCE did I ever see anyone that was not a twink. Why? Cause 90% of the non-twinks are afraid of places you can die easily in.<P>I was at the Temple in Cazic Thule...at 24. Every group I was in kept telling me be careful what I pull.<P>I had a Wizard GATE when I pulled the Archon. Good gods people. Sometimes it takes a twink to show you how things are done. Learn from the twinks.<P>Am I saying all twinks are good? Course not.<P>There are those that ruin the play for others. Some take it to be "I'm better from you so I will just walk over you to get to my goal"...<P>Shun them. I'm sure many of the twinks do as well.<P>Some twinks don't know thier class, but some have taken the time to learn.<P>I leveled to 32 withing 7 Days played. Slow by twink standards. But my skills were always maxxed for my level. (Including Fishing, Baking, Brewing, Pottery. Gonna start Blacksmithing, Fletching, and Tailoring soon too.)<P>Where do I ruin your fun when I'm in your group? I help you get through the tough fights easier. I can take the death cause I will get the exp back later. (You see, I'm in no rush to get anywhere.)<P>What's wrong from a Bard in full lambent? You ever try to SELL Bard items? There are only a handfull on most servers as it is. And fewer are any good at what they do.<P>I think I will stop now because I'm just rambling =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Again, what does KSing have to do with twinking?<P>Farming for twinks? If someone is camping an item for their twink, they will likely camp that item, get that item, and then leave. If they are staying there, collecting them, then they are farming to sell for plat, or worse, Ebay. They may not even HAVE another character.<P>These things have nothing to do with twinking, nothing at all!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004038-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004038.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004038-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004038-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004038&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004038&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
