</FONT><HR>This has been bothering me for a long time. I just cannot understand for one second all this talk about balancing. Why should classes be balanced?<P>This has become a rule now. Every class should always be balanced resulting in every class getting upgraded.<P>I can't see the point. Why do we want to be balanced? If I want to be THE best at dealing damage I should choose to make a warrior (IMO). IF I choose to make another character and discover it was not what I wanted after playing 50 levels, well then either I keep playing my class the way it is supposed to, or I make a new character of the class that have all those abilities I always wanted.<P>Oh, now people will say "If the classes is not balanced everyone will play the same class".<P>Is that true? Nope! No way!<P>Equipment is very important in EQ, too important IMO. If everyone would play Warriors I would be happy to be a paladin who could swim in gear noone else wanted..... <P>The game is too dependent on fighting, classes should be more different by all having their own special abilities. Verant was going the right way when they made rogues more wanted by upgrading picklock. I applauded this move even tho it meant I never could get all the way down in Sebilis for months...<P>But what happened then? All of a sudden there was epic quests implemented. Every class got their own of course, the game has to be fair and balanced *cough*. Rogues went from experts at picklock, sneaking, hiding, corpse retrieval to being the best damage dealers in the game! Is this right? Is this the picture you all get in your head when you imagine a rogue character?<P>Too much steps has already been taken, I wish only rangers had tracking, only clerics could ressurect, only necromancers and mages had pets, only shamans could slow, only enchanters could haste etc..<P>I understand this can not be undone now but PLEASE stop balancing NOW! Right away! There are a LOT of players or each and every class on every server today. That means every class is playable in their current form. So just stop! This whole thing is getting out of hand, really!<P>And for the record I am currently playing Paladin (52), Warrior (51), Druid (56), Necromancer (31), Rogue (25), Wizard (12) so I have actually tried a few classes and really enjoyed most of them.. and when I got mad at my lack of damage output playing my paladin, I didn't go whine somewhere, I made a warrior instead and I am as happy as ever!<P>Best regards<P>Nubbo Rumblebelly &lt;Krieger&gt;<BR>Tunare server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>nice idea, you should just add that the ability to picklock is needed too.<P>If every class would have its unique ability (which doesn't seem to be the case), there must be some situations when it is really and exclusively needed.<P>deef1</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Why balance?<P>Well it comes down to game design. It turns out that games where classes are balance are just more fun to play.<P>It is indeed tru that there will be some people playin weaker classes reguardless, and they will have easire access to equipment that is calss specific, but already introducing class specific equipment is balance. The problem is that the vast majority of people WILL play the strong classes.<P>To further complicate issues, EQ is a grouping game, and most people rely on pick up groups. If there is absolutly no balance, weak classes wil not be able to find groups.<P>Balance does not always reault in upgrades, and many have discovered downgrades is definatly a tool for this as well.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Why is a game with "balanced" classes more fun to play? Who says it is so? Can you give me an example of a game that is "fun" with "balanced" classes and one game that is boring cause the classes are not "balanced"? I think not!<P>People assume balancing is a must to make the game enjoyable for everyone, that is NOT true IMO!<P>And yes I agree that if a ranger has all the special skills to adventure outdoors and he is unmatched in the woods, he will probably be less interesting for a group that is crawling dungeons. <P>But then again to the main issue here, why did you make a Ranger? Why? <P>If you wanted to crawl dungeons you should have made a dwarven warrior or a rogue. <P>Why can't you have both those chars? Do you have to concentrate on one character so you can race your way to level 60?? <P>I say balancing is the death of this game. classes should be as different as possible, different classes will be good in different situations, but then again, that is why you group right? So one player can compensate the other players weaknesses.<P>Players should be desirable because of their special abilities not because they being mainstream and having the best equipment available!<P>And please feel free to remind me of any things that has become better due to balancing. Any. Write me a list that can make me understand the good stuff about balancing because right now I cannot think of any.....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>When speaking of the blue servers, I would have to agree with many of fae's statements.  But in PVP, it is an entirely different story.<P>Roleplay games are all about force/counterforce and when balance is not considered, principally in PVP, then these imbalances in game play lead to exploits by players.  Case in point twinking.  Try killing at lvl 12, a lvl 12 player which cons even wearing lvl 40 or even 50+ gear if your a wearing gear which is BALANCED to your lvl of play. Not gonna happen.  On the care bear servers, who cares, it is not a force against you, those forces are balanced by the games program. Not a living player which is operating outside the games programmed AI, which is predictable, constant, and BALANCED to its programmed world and intended level of attacker.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Biggest problem, as I see it, is that nobody can agree on what the balance IS.  <P>Faeanor, you bring up some great points...what you're talking about IS balance in my book.  One class that is the best there is at what they do...now that, in my opinion, is balance.<P>Some people see the ability to kill things as balance.  Some people see the ability to handle all situations, albeit with their own specific solutions as balance.<P>Balance - what is it?

</FONT><HR>I agree - give up trying to make classes balanced.  Why?  Because the Vision's idea of class balance is seriously warped.<P>Currently, warriors are balanced against necromancers.  eheheh yeah right.  Or magicians.  Or Druids.<P>Balance means equality.<P>Show me a level 35 warrior that can kill all 4 butcherblock dock dwarves as fast as they can spawn solo.  <P>Where's the balance in that?<P>Show me the druid that can absorb being quad attacked for 120dmg was going to be your response, right?  Well which druid that has sow, snare and DOT's is stupid enough to let a mob wail on them in melee range?  The druid will kite the mob like a good little girl.  But the warrior has only one option - stand toe to toe and hope somebody will keep him alive....well it's actually worse.  The warrior's job is actually to simply absorb damage so the druid or mage or wizard or necro can kill it.<P>Not harping on druids or warriors, just an example.  An example to fall on deaf ears.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ah, how interesting!!<P>PropheT711, You are probably right about PvP, I never played PvP in EQ as I hated it in UO so I cannot comment on that.<P>kethlarexa, are you saying that the actions that are taken to "balance" today is in line with my suggestions or is it all about for example making all kind of tanks equal in battle? Please tell me I am wrong when I say that rangers want higher defence capability and paladins want higher damage output. Is that what your witty dictionary line was all about or is that trying to make classes all the SAME!<P>Zrazzt, ummm what are you saying? Did you miss my entire point here? I don't care whose "court" any ball is in. Classes should be different. Are you implying casters are impossible to play these days? Or are you saying you can kill a dragon with 20 warriors but not with 20 wizards? If you are saying the latter you obviously did miss my point, because I say we don't need balance (that is the Verant kind of balance, not my and TheSettite's kind..)<P>anthe, I agree. And to make my point totally clear, let the druids quadkite and the warriors take a ton of damage. If you are jealous of the druids then feel free to start one yourself!<P>Keep the opinions coming people, I will be here to respond  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sorry I posted a bit too soon as well.<P>I feel that alot of classes are balanced as it<BR>is, but others aren't. You also have to take<BR>into consideration the "fun factor". Being<BR>a cleric isn't considered fun by some because<BR>all you ever do is heal, sit, whatever. But<BR>you are always welcome in groups.<P>Being a Ranger is considered very fun by most<BR>who play the class, however it is difficult<BR>for some to find groups.<P>Balance shouldn't be based exclusivly on<BR>numbers and abilities.

</FONT><HR>Yes, you are right, people should enjoy the game. But what I am saying here repetedly is that if, after playing your character for 40 levels, you finally discover sitting on your butt and healing tanks once in a while, is not your cup of the, then make another character!<P>Don't try to make the game fun by whining until Verand gives in and upgrade your class in one way or another. Play that class you enjoy instead. As I said in one of my first posts, there are a lot of players playing ALL the classes on the server. Stop "balancing" now and they will still play!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Your class is alot less fun if you see another<BR>class doing everything you can do, but alot <BR>better. It makes you question why you put all that<BR>time into making something worth less than <BR>someone who put in the exact amount of time,<BR>but is worth alot more.<P>Not all people crave fun though, either. There<BR>are alot ALOT of people out there who want<BR>power. They want to be the best, be highest level,<BR>have the best eq, etc etc. Those people pay just<BR>as much as the fun seekers, and they are important<BR>to VI. And they usually play alot more too. If<BR>it wasn't for those people playing to be more<BR>powerful instead of for geniune fun, VI would<BR>have alot less money to improve things that<BR>really need improving for the rest of us. Less<BR>money = less resources.<P>But there are some things, not based on fun or<BR>any other outside factor, that do need balancing<BR>in the game. Always remember balance does not<BR>mean equal. But what you lack in you should be<BR>able to make up for in another area. Rogues can't<BR>tank, do heavy damage. Warriors can't do as much<BR>damage, but can take heavy damage, etc etc.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There is a lot going into the "BALANCING" issue.  I play a rogue.  I have a lot of skills that are good and others that I can't even use or I can use but they basically do nothing(sence trapse, disarm traps).  Yet every other class has skills they can use.  The balancing issue is <BR>A.  Get rid of the skills that are useless<BR>B.  Change the game to make them useful<BR>C.  Make them into another skill that might be useful.<P>It isnt a matter of who is better who isn't better.

</FONT><HR>Here's one very good reason for class balance:<P>It takes months, many months, to rise to levels where imbalance is drastic.<P>If I played a game for a week and said, aww, crud, my class sucks, I'd make a new character.<P>After putting 4 months, or 6 months, into a character to find out it sucks, that's when I say it's too much trouble to make a new character. I'll plod along with my mediocre character and miss out on much of the high end content.<P>Here's another very good reason:<P>Even if it's reasonable to simply make a new character of one of the few good classes, that means that the majority of classes are hardly ever played. <P>I for one like the variety. It makes the game less boring, more unique. Take away the reason for playing the variety, and everyone becomes carbon copies of each other.<P>Erudite necro, halfling druid, troll warrior, high elf cleric, maybe a few barbarian shaman, iksar monks, and dark elf rogues. That's about all you'd need. Throw away the hundred other class/race combos, they're imbalanced and you wouldn't want to play them.<P>Hardly a good game concept. Especially since most new players would have sunk months into finding out that they picked the wrong character.<P>Balance is good. It's a game. We should all have fun, all be able to play, all have access to all the content.<P>Not inviting druids to a group in Velketor's Lab because (in there) they can't do anything but snare and DS and mostly just contribute to LD is plain wrong. <P>Not inviting SKs/paladins to Skyshrine groups because they die too fast without those cool warrior HPs and disciplines is just wrong.<P>The examples continue.<P>It's not the players that are wrong for doing this. It's the game that is wrong for creating this imbalance (simple mistake, we're all human, even game designers) and letting the imbalance continue unmitigated (no longer a mistake; inexcusable and irresponsible mismanagement of real player concerns).<P>Kudos to Verant for addressing these issues in a timely fashion.<P>Timely fashion? This imbalance has existed for years, you say.<P>Yes, but the game content didn't really make the imbalance so drastically play-limiting until SoV came out and tilted the palying field in favor of so few classes. And now, only a couple months later, Verant is fixing it.

</FONT><HR>Well, my message was just deleted so this one is gonna be way shorter.  OK, all these balance issues are 50+.  Pre 50 everyone had their thing that made them useful. 50+ this isnt true anymore. You can do a raid with just clerics, rogues and chanters to buff and youll be doing great. That is NOT balance.  Most of us 50+ have spent TONS of time on our characters (63 days for me) and have the definite right to be pissed when we all of a sudden find our selves not useful at all and mainly a liability for groups or raids.  Also with the ranger thing, i love that idea but almost all high level areaas are dungeons, all best loot is from deungeons, all groups are in deungeons so whats the ranger gonna do, solo? LOL  Its the mechanics of the game and they need to be fixed for it to work.  And for that thing of there's plenty of classes.  Check how many shadowknights 50+ to warriors and tell me how balanced.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Orodruin, I played my Paladin for over 70 days in game and over 1 year in real life before I decided I did not have time to play a class that had to group to be able to get exp. So I made druid and all of a sudden I was happy again.<P>I say that if you have put up with your charachter for months it doesn't "suck". You might have discovered there are other classes that are better then your at specific things but that does not mean your character suck. And as I said before, if you hate your character it is never too late to start over. There are PLENTY of fun stuff to do on the way to 60.<P>Are you saying that right now this very moment, on the server you are currently playing, there are ONLY Erudite necros, halfling druids, troll warriors, high elf clerics, maybe a few barbarian shamans, iksar monks, and dark elf rogues? No I don't think so. And as I said in my first post, if EVERY melee based player choose to play a warrior I would be happy to be the very special Paladin decked out to his teeth in incredible gear that noone of the warriors could use!<P>mightyYODA, "You can do a raid with just clerics, rogues and chanters to buff and youll be doing great. That is NOT balance." Ummmm in what way is that not balanced? And on the other hand why shouldn't you be able to do this? <P>Then again I oppse STRONGLY to the fact that sneaky thieves should be better at dealing damage than a raging ogre wielding a giant axe! But that's just me who oppose to that, after all that is a result of balancing.... someone whined long ago that rogues couldn't get a group because they were not good enough as tanks. I say that sounds right to me. If a group need a damagedealer/meatshield then a halfling with a knife IS the worst choise... A Ogre in full plate would be better... but if you are going to need someone to picklock or sneak your way into a dungeon then a rogue is the choice.. <P>"Also with the ranger thing, i love that idea but almost all high level areaas are dungeons, all best loot is from deungeons, all groups are in deungeons so whats the ranger gonna do, solo? " Aaaah, now we're talking! SO what should you do to adress this issue then? Make Rangers better at taking damage so they become more warriorlike and less Rangerlike? Is THAT a good solution? NO! Make better outdoorzones! Put the time into that and you have solved the problem!<P>"Check how many shadowknights 50+ to warriors and tell me how balanced." So the measurement of balance is that there should be as many characters of each class? Bleh, I already made my poin on this issue. On Tunare you can take a Shadowkingt to Plane of Fear and have a complete set of armoir in one week! ONE WEEK! My Paladins set is not complete after 50 raids.... Why should there be the same ammount of each class on a server? Let people do what they want, but don't keep changing the rules, if they want to be one of 10 Shadowknights or 1 of 1000 warriors, let them decide that!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053378&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053378&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
