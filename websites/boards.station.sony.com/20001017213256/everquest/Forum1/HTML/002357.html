</FONT><HR>I've never had DSL so I can't compare the two. I do have AT&T Cable access. Currently, things are going very well. There was a time though, when they over sold and bandwidth suffered greatly here in the Seattle, WA, area. Things are better. But remember that bandwidth on cable depends on how many subscribers share your line.<P>Myli, still struggling to get to 20, level 19 Wood Elf Druid</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I have AT&T @Home and love it.  Just like any other service, every so often there are minor problems.  The only major problem I had was when some outsourced cable installation people were jacking with the cable lines in our neighborhood and screwed things up, which wasn't really @Home's fault, but they sent a tech guy out to change some  line split decible thing to compensate for it.<P>Anyhow, it is nice to be able to download stuff from Napster in 45 seconds.  I would never go back to analog dial up ever again after having cable.<P>For information you wish to check out:<BR>http://www.speedguide.net<P>I was talking with some tech guy and he said that cable had much more future possibilities then DSL, but he may have been biased; however, I can see his logic.  And, if I remember correctly, DSL also depends on how far you live from a router or server or something of that nature, so that is something else to consider.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>DSL or Cable???  To be honest, for EQ there isn't really to much difference.  I have DSL, my neighbor has a T1, and my other buddy has cable.  We all go about the same speed when logged on, and as far as lag, we don't see lag like like the analog modem users do.  For DSL your question you want to ask the provider is the setup DYNAMIC or STATIC?  Is it a splittered or splitterless installation.  If you end up with a Static IP Addres, you may want to look into a firewall program. Splittered connection is simpply a phone jack being dedicated STRICTLY for you DSL modem.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I've got cable at home, DSL at work. The cable connection is generally faster, and costs less per month. It's probable that DSL residential service isn't as pricy as business service, but from what I've seen it still doesn't have the bang-for-the-buck of cable.<P>To give you an idea of cable performance, I've downloaded files from the net at over 400 kilobytes per second. That's uncommon due to server load and hop distance, but it happens. 80k/second downloads are fairly common. Bear in mind that if you're receiving information from a server that's under heavy load or that caps its per connection bandwidth, it won't matter how fast your end of the connection is.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well I run a DSL from mindspring/earthlink residential services.  At work, we use a T1 line, and I find my dsl to run faster.  Of course, there isn't 60 or so users at my house, so there is a difference.  The nice thing about cable is that you don't have to be within 3 miles of a central office.  I am about 9000 feet from mine, and the fiber backbone for the cable hasn't been installed in my area yet, so I went with dsl.  I run at 1.2M upload, and not to sure about download, never bothered to test.  My test program shows me to be 22 times more efficient than a modem.  This speed varies with the distance from your CO.  Cable as a whole runs faster.  DSL (or ADSL which is becoming the standard) is opt to run at 1.5M.  Cable can carry more(not sure of the exact number, and don't care to open the reference book right now)  and is generally more accessable than a DSL line.  And it can be installed relativly quickly depending on the company.  DSL is operated by the provider, but installed by a third party contractor, and can be a pain.<P>Security is a different issue entirely.  Both of these connections are considered "always on" connections.  You will enter a realm of new and completely different and dangerous viruses, and a different breed of hackers.  You definitly need to look into beefing up your anti-virus systems.  Now there is the option of firewalling off your system, and most providers offer a firewall protection free or for a small fee.  But here's the catch.  Everquest spazes out with firewalls.  There is something about their encoding that throws a tantrum when it sees a firewall and some packet sniffers.  Fortunatly as a home user, you have less to worry about than your average company.<P>Basically, either dsl or cable is a good choice.  Whatever you choose you will wonder what you did without it, you just need to be a little more aware of things out there.  If you want to get some info on dsl look at a site called www.dslreports.com.  It has a lot of good info.  Hope this was a little help.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>there is really is no difference, except how each connects. Depending on location you will have to look at that factor. Cable can be bad if the company doesn't provide enough bandwith. That is to say, if you have a lot of people in your area and they have cable modems, you could see a decrese in performance do to lack of bandwidth.  I have had both, currently on cable cause where I am its the only thing avaliable besides that crappy thing called a phone modem. <BR>Personally if I had a choice I would take my DSL over my current cable, since I had to switch due to moving I get more PL and lag a lot on certain zones. <BR>I would go with DSL if your within 8000 feet of the substation where you connect. <BR>Best thing to do is ask who has both and ask about their opinions, each is good, has their ups and downs. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I've used both. @home Cable and now Telus RDSL. My concern was security, which cable has NONE. The downloads are extremely comparable in speed. I avg'd 1200k/s on cable and I get upwards of 1600k/s on RDSL. Now for the main security issue, since cable users share a common "gateway" for an entire neighborhood all a pesky cracker needs to do is get a packet sniffer on said "gateway" (easily done on most cable setups, @home being one of the easiest, due to a complete lack of security) and said cracker now has sysadmin access to all info going in and out of that gateway. Who needs back orifice/Netbus when you can watch everything the user does without even having to touch their system?<BR>xDSL connects do use gateways, but since the actual line is dedicated you and 20-30 neighbors aren't/can't be watched at the same time, in my experience security is also a lot tighter with xDSL providors. <BR>I will never go back to cable, even though I use a firewall and have my comp locked down tight. The lack of concern showed by most cable providors when you bring this to their attention is appauling and most knowledgeable users are completely ignored when these points are brought up to them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>This question can be argued either way forever.  Simply because there are so many variables involved in determining upload/download speeds.  I have heard a lot of stories about both and my opinion is this.  Pick the option based solely on customer service because sooner or later you are going have some problem.  You don't want that problem to drag out day after day not being able to get online.<P>I went with cable in my area because at the time the only major company in my area offering DSL was USWest.  Their customer service was, and still is, horrible.  (they recently got bought out by Qwest and the service has gotten better but is still lacking)  So I picked cable because I had heard that Cox had good customer service.  They do, I had slow speeds when it was first installed and with one phone call it was fixed within 12 hours.  I am very pleased with my cable modem.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  But I am sure DSL would be just as good with good service.<P>My suggestion is to talk with as many people in your immediate area, say within a 2 mile radius of your house, and ask them how they like their cable/DSL, specifically the customer service.  Good luck making your choice and may you be lag free in the future.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=002357&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=002357&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
