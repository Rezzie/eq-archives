I must admit that I don't really expect to see too many suggestions. The warrior seems to be a well balanced class. And we have to keep in mind that the warrior is a sort of staple class, upon which the relative balance of several other classes hinges directly.<P>So this is the forum to talk about what is right and what is wrong with warriors. Go ahead and tell me about bugs you've seen too. I'm not focusing on them, I'm concentrating on class balance here. But I will also take note of non-balance concerns as well.<P>Have at it, muscle-bound-types.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>yay first post! =P<P>Let's keep it going peeps<P>Alright, where to begin...<P>1.) AC soft cap? I really need clarification, i'm not going to buy any cobalt from the millions of dr00ds that have it (why them and not us? hmmm...), if my ac will not make me more effective.<P>2.) Binding? I feel VERY foolish when begging some level 12 wizard for a bind when I need one, please supply bind potions for around 25-30p, and allow shamans to make them. Same way casters bind us, no special binding anywhere, just a good old fashioned non begging bind.<P>3.) Epic Weapon - Ummm... haste please. Being equal with the knights now in defense means i should be dealing more damage than them. Umm... sure. Haste would make 100's of warriors smile broadly one day =).<P>4.) Two Handers - Give us double effective taunt with a two hander. Chances are I will NOT EVER taunt off of a dot caster with a 2hander, and probably not off of my poor ranger buddy with half as many hps. Thousands of us here love 2handers, and I only use one when another warrior is in the group with fast weapons =). Double taunt is all it needs, and maybe a damage increase curve based on the core damage of the weapon. I read a little earlier, a 6 damage weapon should NOT have the same damage bonus as a 40 damage weapon.<P>Cobalt drops - I was lucky I suppose and I have my gloves and boots and didn't have to buy either. This came with a year of sitting in Karnors. I believe I won rolls for aroudn 70 pairs of singing steel boots and a few dozen deepwater boots. Just recently I saw a pair of cobalt boots. Geez.... I won't even get into the bracer or helm. Somehow legs are dropping well, Everyone and their mother tells me everyday that a pair dropped on the VS raid I didn't attend =(.<P>Green mob problems - One simple solution, any mob half of our level can be killed instantly by a critical attack (like it would change anything), and green mobs that dont give any experience will take double critical hit damage. That won't SOLVE anything and we will still have problems, but it's a VERY good place to start. OF course these should be given somewhere around 35-40, where the problems begin to arise. I suggest 35.<P>Berserk - As it stands, it IS fun to have your cleric heal you with remedies every few minutes and stay under 35% so you can crippling blow, but it's kind of silly. I suggest, as many others have, to create an LOH/HT TYPE berserk button. IT will have a recycle time of around 30 minutes and let us set off berserk. Also, please remove the agility debuff from berserk, the adrenaline flowing through your veins while berserk will greatly increase your agility in any situation (Especially if you need to get away from death!)<P>Archery - Remove the z axis targetting problems, as it stands it's only good for pulling, and i'm tired of getting that message while pulling on the wall in PoH. Make it like casting a spell, you can't fire at anything you can't see, and you can hit anything regardless of z axis (like it should be, for the most part).<P>Usefulness on raids - lol just kidding!<P>I don't think I have left anything out, but I'm most certain the other well informed warriors on this message board will fill in anything I haven't already. <P>Achazael Hammerfall<BR>54th Champion<BR>The Regulators RallosZek<P>P.S. In addition we'd like stronger healing spells, a better pet, backstab, sneak, LOH, HT, and a version of sunstrike that does twice as much damage, oh and more mana.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>     I really see no point in posting any of my concerns about the warrior class since I haven't seen hide nor hair of a reply to any of the threads regarding the Warrior Talk in a long time. But hey, there's always a glimmer of hope.<P>     Taunt- All the HP I can muster will not make a lump of difference if I can't keep the mob on me.<P>     Hp/AC- Like I said in my last post, not every warrior has uber gear. And, not every Warrior is a Large race.<P>     If the changes on hybrid defense to go through to the live servers will not make me angry or envious. But, what I can't understand is why are you going to make a Hybrid have the same skill cap in there Parent classes prime ability. It's good to see that Hybrids are going to be helped out in areas that need it though.<P>     One last thing I'd like to add is this. I don't mind being outdamaged, thats not my job. I don't mind giving up the ability to cast, thats not my job. I don't mind knowing that I have a good chance of dying while i'm running through a long zone with nothing but green mobs, escape and travel is not my forte. You see, I have given up alot skills and abilities to be able to just do one thing, take a beating. Please see to it that the only defining thing about a Warrior stays defining.<P>     </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>hmmmmmmm i have played a warrior for some time now, i am level 47, and...for the most parts......its been fun and not to painful, i mean YEA i would love to have half the sugjestions..and yea i found it a bit annoying that i could at any time be out damaged by a ranger or rouge--yes rouge, all it takes is a 290 damage BS..and i cry, I wanna do that much in 1 hit 8(<P>i was a little POed when i saw deffence = to warriors Offence = to warriors...mainly because...OMG they were not that much inferior to start with...<P>also on the Epic issue, Haste as i see it is now needed more than ever with the Ranger offence = Warrior Offence because ranger epics are 14/24 and 13/23 with 40% haste makeing thier weapons actually 	14/14.4 and 13/13.8 where ours are still 14/24 14/24....wich is just a LITTLE better???<P>I Belive that IF the offence/deffence changes on the hybrid classes goes live, then thier EXP penalties should be increased again<P>i belive that Bind wounds should be able to be gotten higher, not have it capped at 100<P>some skills between 35 and 52 when we get our 1st real useful disc<P>and yes, like everyone says--higher Cobalt Drop Rate<P>I would like to see Disarm not removed, but inhansed so it does some good, like when disarm is sucsesful it also works as a short stun *wham your sword is gone, i'd be stuned* and perhaps as a de-buff of some kind makeing it usefull<P>also the AoE taunt..however at times it feels like it alreayd is one *you taunt the Wan Ghoul Knight so it atacks you * all 6 Ghoul Knights are beating me into the ground<P>Archery seems as though it should have some uped usefulness, perhaps just some bows with good stat +s would do it, i mean, i am a warrior and i want a Idol of the Thorned instead of another WEAPON just because of its kick butt stats<P>I would like to see some mid ranged cloaks--the Lizardscale cloak outta Cazic Thule is for a QUEST it shouldnt also be a cloak for warriors to wear untill 50is when they might find a better one<P>An idea i had was earrings or just normal rings that are say a 3% stackable haste, wear 2 of them and a FBSS now its 27% not just 21%, just an idea<P>also i LOVE the idea of Berzerker on a Timer<P>Also i love the idea of a high level close range multi target AoE kinda swing, though i think it should be with 2h slashing only and not in a 360 degree, more like a 90-120 angle infront of you, like Sweeping Blow or something<P>I do not think warriors should be able to solo...i like the ability to solo a single blue thing that argos on me<P>I also think the Cobalt Helm should have Ultra Vision not Infravision, Infravision only helps out i think it is 3 races, Ultra Vision would help out somethink like 7 or 8<P>Terses Truestorm<BR>47 Holy Warrior of Marr<BR>Tarew Marr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have over 100 days of play time on my lvl 56 (soon to be 57) warrior on the Quellious server, and after reading a great amount of the posts here I see that their is alot of good ideas that can be put in game that won't throw other classes out of balance and i'll start this post at thos fine points.<P>1 taunt needs to be revamped or a aoe effect added to it, or a diffrant aoe tuant.<P>2 don't remove disarm, but instead and a mini tuant to it...i mean for christ sake your trying to remove the monster weapon. from a RP point it should piss off what i'm trying to disarm. and no this mini tuant shouldn't carry to monks/pallys/ etc etc.<P>3 i'm not all for removeing the effects off our armor. I love the + 25 str buff on the cobbie boots, and the shrink rocks on the bracer( i don't have one tho, but would love one). If you want to remove the effects, please and stats to the armor, or remove the right click able part and make them permant effects, ie cobbie breatplate effect invigor as a permant effact the warrior won't lose sta again, just a idea. For god sakes up the armor drops, and make all warrior only armor no drop. I'm sick of haveing to shell out thounds of plat to some caster for the armor i need to save his bacon.<P>4 the epic quest, whats epic about this weapon? sure it looks cool as hell but the dly really really needs to be lowered, i have weapons right now that are better then this item, but i'm still doing the quest just becuase it's their. that bring me to another point please please redo/fix some of the quest. i trutfully don't have time to camp hate for weeks to get the hand, or kill some dragons over and over in hopes they will coughup the item i need, and last part make all epic quest items for all epics no drop. i don't need to be shelling out more plat for another item i need.<P>5 make bind wounds the same as monks, and i liked the idea that another person had. As your bind wound skill goes up you bind your wounds faster.<BR> <BR>6 maybe up the skill caps on dodge/parry/riposte.<P>7 fix cirtical hits and crippleing blows. When i weild a 30 dmg 2hed weapon and get normal doubble hits in the 110 to 170 dmg range and i get a critical hit for 50 to 135 dmg range, theirs got to be something wrong with that. all crippleing blows should stun not have a chance to stun, and i love the idea that a crippleing blow could do a mild debuff/slow.<P>Please fix this..<P>Mezmer lands a Crippleing Blow!(317)<BR>You slash a drolvarg guardain for 335 points of damage.<BR>Mezmer lands a Crippleing Blow!(212)<BR>You slash a drolvarg guardain for 230 points of damage.<BR>Mezmer lands a Crippleing Blow!(86)<BR>You bash a drolvarg guardain for 95 points of damage.<P>Get the idea their? ^^^^^<P>8 do not and i mean do not up defence/offence for the hybrids. They knew what they were doing when they chose to play that class, they took the abilities to cast spells to offset weaker melee skills. If you do up their defence/offence skills all your doing is showing that whineing long enuff will get them what they want.<P>Mezmer Manhammer/Tinlaor Tankbuffer<BR>lvl 56 warrior/lvl 44 shaman on Quellious<BR>proud members of Hypnotic</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ive posted this before and ill likely post it again.<P>you take OUR warrior abuilitys and your slowly giveing them to the other classes who use a wepons (as well as spells) because they are "*****ing" about thier classes. atleast i think thats why your "improveing them", they complained.<P>ok im a warrior and IM complaneing. <P>Complaint #1) AC / Equipment gathering.<BR>im a lvl 50 warrio on Povar, im a member of a rather large (not uber) guild whos learning the ways of the elite guilds. my AC at level 50 is 844 un buffed with 2040 hp's. (laugh all you want im getting used to it) i goto Karnors on a very regular basis and actually get refused for groups because my AC is too low. (i have berzerker Gloves, Stonewoodmail BP, and the rest is Guardian armor, HBC, Lava Pendant, etc etc. my point here is to get any better armor, i have to wait on my guild to run a hate raid (if someone else doesnt beat us to it) or PoG raid (if we have 3 hours prep time due to the wonderful placement of the portal into WL and the damn dragon) then i have to deal with trying to beat every other warrior in a roll of the dice. and thats for just 1 piece.  fix that for ballance.<P>Complaint #2)<BR>Travle to and from the points of interest in the world YOU created. im in Karnors, being laughed at for thinking anyone would want me for a tank in thier group. ok thats the high level area. now i either have to wait for someone to take a chance on lil old me, OR travle to some other lvl appropriate area and try again. travle time from Karnors to ...... (Lguk 46 mins if the boats meet appon arival, 1 hour 26 mins standard travle time with current boat placemtents) ...... (Hole 2 hours 20 mins with Sow and 3 boat trips) ...... (Kael or anywhere in Velious for that matter 1 hour 47 mins just to reach the iceclad dock at the gnomes igloos)  FIX that for Balance.<P>care to make this an easier job? were warriors, we should be the king of the only skill we have, mele combat. you absor said yourself "why should warriors be kings of mele?" simple, you didnt give us anything else to be good at. either change that some how or after your done turning every other class into a warrior with perks, you make us into something better aswell.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Major warrior issues at play:<P>1) AC Soft Cap at 1100 needs to be removed. AC over 1100 should make JUST AS MUCH of a difference incrementally as does each additional point of AC from 1 to 1100. That AC soft caps at 1100 essentially means that our AC advantage over other classes is meaningless.<P>2) Warriors need an HP boost. You've rejected this idea already, but it needs to be reconsidered. Why? Well, now that you've given hybrids equivalent defense skills, they now can cast NICE spells, have a generally superior weapon selection, have similar (in the case of rangers, superior) offense, and nearly equivalent defense. What you've done with these upcoming changes is created a tank-mage class in the paladin/sk: a 99% warrior, 50% caster. Last I checked, 99 and 50 do not add up to 100%. How is this balanced? Well, for starters, if you increased the warrior hitpoint margin SIGNIFICANTLY above that of hybrids, it would be perhaps the only real way to combat the imbalances wrought by your irrational and knee-jerk hybrid upgrades.<P>3) Most important: TAUNT needs to WORK more effectively. I should not have to mash the taunt key repeatedly and pray to God just to get a mob off someone, when any hybrid can taunt any mob off anyone INSTANTLY with a single spell. Am I not, as a warrior, billed as the "Tank"? Is being able to do my job (taunt and take damage the best of any class) too much to ask for?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>umm transwarp think for a second.<BR>If they nerf warrior Offense then we will never be able to taunt mobs of rangers and casters (like we can now), thus drastically increasing body counts.<P>Anyway trying to avoid whining but here is what i see as needing fixing/looking inot<P>1) Taunt-I think its kinda ridiculous that i have to dual wield the rest of my career to hope to hold taunt on mobs.  Please increase a warrior's base taunt as well as the 2H taunt-some of us do like using 2h I know I do.<P>2) I like the beserking as a skill idea-replace disarm with this i know that at level 41 with maxed disarm skill for my level that it is just a waste of a hotkey to even have it on my UI.  <P>3) Although I am quite a bit away from it-as i said level 41 non guilded warrior:  Please look into the epic weapon.  My suggestion is to either give it a haste component/Decreased delay/or some sort of uber taunt proc.  Otherwise I see no need to replace dual wielded lammy's or Jade maces with that (yes its an exageration, but so far ive noticed that to keep my taunt factor up i have to use low delay/relativley low dmg weapons-for example i use 2 dwarven saps/beetle stinger/yk and have no haste items)<P>Also i have a question:  Is it normal that a Barbarian warrior with a 115 stamina wielding a wurmslayer and the torch (cant remember the name) have more stamina in a battle than a dwarf with a stamina of 108 using 2 dwarven saps?  It seems that every battle he is still half+ of the yellow bar while I am half or lower on mine.<P>Just wondering</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I believe that warriors are having a bit of an identity crisis. EQ is a role-playing game, and we are struggling to find our role. <P>The warrior class is one without flexibility. We have no spells, and no unique special abilities. (some disciplines, but they are mostly useless, and most do not come into play until the 50's)<P>What do we gain to offset this lack of flexibility? According to the EQ manual, we are the "masters of armed combat". But we are not, monks are. Instead, we are glorified punching bags. We stand and swing our weapons, not so much to inflict damage, but to distract the mob from hitting the monk, rogue, and casters. Is that all we are, glorified punching bags, begging to be bruised so that someone with martial or magical mastery can inflict enough damage to kill our enemy? <P>It is, and now that small ability to absorb damage, the only thing that we can do better than other classes, is threatened. If we are only slightly better tanks that hybrids, why play a warrior? <P>The root of the problem is that if warriors are noticeably better tanks than hybrids, then groups will almost always prefer a warrior to a hybrid. Conversely, if there is not a noticeable difference between the tanking abilities in warriors and hybrids, a group will almost always perfer the hybrid. Neither of these two situations is balanced. <P>It seems as though Verant has gone with the second scenario. <P>I express sympathy for hybrid characters, since inferior melee ability + inferior spellcasting ability = inferior character. However, I don't think that diminishing the melee superiority of warriors is the way to go. <P>This is what I suggest:<P>1. Fix taunt, so that warriors can compel mobs to engage them in melee combat<P>2. An area effect taunt that would work against multiple targets within a certain radius of the warrior. This would be a seperate button.<P>3. Give us better gear, at all levels of the game. Also it would be nice if we could actually get it.<P>4. Improve the hybrid classes without diminishing our relative melee prowess. The hybrids should get abilities that improve them that are not derived from their parent classes. A possibility would be reducing refresh time for ht and lh.<P>5. Increase the ammount of damage that warriors do. This falls partially under the gear issue, but I think it is worth mentioning seperately. Also, all melee damage should be increased. Does it make since for an unarmed mob 5 levels below me to be out-damaging me?<P>Now some issues that are not warrior-specific, but still affect warriors:<P>6. Melee classes should be able to bind themselves in a city. What would be wrong with a /bind command? <P>7. Why should teleporting be dependant on 2 classes? When many people create alternate characters primarily for this ability, doesn't this reek of imbalance? As Norrath expands, the issue of mobility will become more important. Does verant want the majority of the population to be wizards and druids? Even now, how long would it take to go from kunark to velious by boat? I don't like to spend time begging for ports and sows, or watching my character walk or ride a boat. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Im a 54th season gnomish warrior on Innoruuk (yes I know only like 2% of warriors are gnomes but im a warrior non the less).  I have been reading a majority of posts lately and I will try to collaberate and add and try not to repeat useless rants.<P>1) Issue of taunting: in my lvls of experience, I noticed that taunt worked very well up till around 50, then on 49+ mobs it stopped effectiveness.  Then you guys upped effectiveness and I have noticed big change in seb. Thx for this.  So at the moment IMO I DONT think there needs to be a significant change because I have very little trouble taunting mobs effectivly (except those 55+ rogues with ragebringer hehe).  I think the idea of area affect taunting would be a nice suddle addition for those times when $hit happens.<P>2) AC/HP:<BR>a)WAR/ROG/MNK: I have been discussing such things as ac/hp with a few fellow warriors /rogs /monks.  i was supprised to find out that on the monks and rogues  that i talked to, there naked ac was significantly higher.  I know this is because of low ac armor, but I think that in a RP perspective, warriors shouldnt be weenie ppl who wear massive armor, but buff ppl with massive armor, so it would be nice if a small increase in naked ac for warriors.<BR>b)Cobalt: The only pieces I have noticed in short supply are helms and bracers (bps and legs dont count because VS and Trak  drops them).  As for my personal input about procs of cobalt are as follows: Gloves-useless proc might as well not put it on there. Boots-nice when not with a druid/sham.Arms - i love minor shielding, it has nice ac and mr, only bad thing is talismans overstack =/.Helm-I am a gnome and this helps none except for high ac which i can get better helms for atm. Bracer- same as helm, this spell does nothing for gnomes ( i realize it helps other greatly because most warriors are large but there is no proccing warrior armor for small races). i havent used bp and legs but i would bet they help reduce downtime with the heal and i could see legs helping get to groups.<P>3) Weapons : i dont know if im the only who thinks this but.. What is the closest thing to warrior equilvalent of the the HIGH end weapons other melee classes get (for example: Sword of  mornin, noc blade, lupine dagger, etc)? Closests thing I can think of would be maybe lamentation or bloodpoint but those can be used by multiple classes.<P>4) Twinking:  It sadened me greatly the first time i saw a lvl 20 warrior with more cobalt than me and duel lamentations.  i know that there will always be a way of twinking because some items have to be tradable, but I think there should be a way to make some weapons and armor for warriors (and any other class that it applies) to be no-drop or have a unique id like religion so that warriors of a certain lvl may use apropriate gear (like having cobalt made only 45+ warriors be able to wear, etc).  I dont know if these are valid ways to prevent this but I am basically saying pls help stop twinking or at least make HIGH end items un twinkable.<P>5) Bandaids; increasing the cap to that of monks seems nice.<P>6)Disciplines: <BR>a)Effectiveness; out of the 3 i have, i use the 52 discipline 99% of time and would like thank you guys because it works VERY well and has saved my gnomish butt many times.  I only wished the dmg dealing /discs where upgrades to that one.<BR>b)Stacking: stacking disciplines would greatly improve the current /discs and would probally take out the need for revamping and adding new /discs.  All you would have to do is make every /disc have its own reset time till it could be used again, and set limit to number used at once (2 would work wonders).  i am not saying let a 60 warriors use all disciplines at once, but rather a warrior of correct lvl using 2 at a time (like I would combine 53+54 discipline so as to not waste an hour of waiting to critical on a lvl 55 mob 3 times in a row).  You could balance this as to have the refresh time on any combined /disc be double the normal refresh than that of a /disc used singurly.<P>7) Class; As for class, i am very happy playing my warrior.  It is very fun and rewarding and I dont mind people being able to out damage me, because they wouldnt be there if a warrior wasnt. Side note - I think there should be more items that only small warriors should have that help them (exp:  Cobalt helm/bracer dont do gnomes any good, we dont get hero bracer, nathsar greatsword doesnt make any larger race warriors regret being large, etc)<P>I hope my points are valid in your eyes, and understood and taken into consideration or collaberated upon, because its late here and a long day at work and sometimes i express my thoughts unclearly and misspelled.  If anyone has any comments, questions or CONSTRUCTIVE criticism for me, pls feel free to email me at quirk@austin.rr.com.<P>P.S- GNOMEs are good warriors too!<BR>Quirk Ikaru<BR>54th season gemchopper<BR>innoruuk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

BUT<P>WHAT TO DO<P>WARRIORS NEED TWO THINGS ONLY<BR>1 THE ABSOLUTE HIGHEST AC IN THE GAME&lt; BAR NONE<BR>wich would allow them to take more hits than other classes for less damage.<P>2. THE ABSOLUTE BEST TAUNT IN THE GAME&lt;BAR NONE<BR>wich would keep the mobs on the warrior. <BR>do not make taunt based on damage, my god if that is the case u need to up warriors damage above all to let him do his job.<P>Summary<P>Warriors life is the toughest, we have no skills our spells that will get us out of danger when stuff goes wrong, and stuff goes wrong all the time. sk and monks fd, palys hit there loh and run to zone, casters gate, and warriors die.<P>thats fine, i will stand and die so the casters can get there gates off and monks have time to fd but DAM IT, I NEED TO BE AT HOME IN A MOBS FACE&lt; and they only way i can do so is to have ALOT MORE AC than i do now, so mobs that hit rangers for 120, will mostlikly hit me for 30. after all i should be wearing the heavyest armor in the game. <P>SAD BUT TRUE<P>honestly the hybrids are so close now, you go ahead and make them warriors, while ur at it, hey let them use same spells as equal lvl caster, and hey, thats right u did remove there exp penalty, that reallly owned. hey i predict well see alot more rangers solowing, same with sks, and now there so close to warriors WITH SOW&lt; BUFFS&lt; DOTS&lt; HEALS&lt; DDS&lt; etc, the only class in the game 100% reliant on grouping will be left in the cold<P>HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF<P>Verant really messed up on the warrior, they have come a long ways in past months to help us, and i guess, becuse they have helped us, really ballanced the meles, and the hybrids dont like it.<P>so you say, u  already balanced the warriors so they need no change, DUH! THERE BALANCED TO THE CURRRENT ABILITY OF THE OTHER TANKS&lt; U INCRESE THE HYRBRIDS&lt; YOU MUST INCRESE THE WARRIIORS OR ALL UR RECENT WORK IS IN WASTE!<P>HUMOR<P>hey, i check all my other classes posts and they all have repliys and somwhat of a answer, warriors post on and on and we only get silence,<P>they are about to screw us, cant u tell</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I could agree with you, if you all complained on your skills, but 90% of the post isn't about warrior problems, it's about what Paladins/SKs/Rangers getting...<BR>And then we have "but aaah, Paladins/SKs/Rangers have useful spells, can we please trade that with our crits crips etc?"&lt;&lt;<P>What we are complaing about  is the fact that hybrids will get one of the two things that makes playing a warrior great, with out paying in some way for it. We got told that cus we are your base class that to do any thing to us would unbalance  ever thing, but it's ok that hybrids get to become just as good as us in one skill that more then paid for tobe damn near the best at in it.  Most hybrids spells are not useless( I know I use them all the time as a palaian).<P><BR>&gt;&gt;Alot more HP<BR>Alot more AC<BR>Higher defense-ability caps (such as riposte etc.)<BR>Higher offense (and weapon skill)<BR>Kick<BR>Crits/Crips <BR>Berserk<BR>Dual Weild&lt;&lt;<P>We get about 300 to 400 more hp then you  if both  the warrior & SK/PALLY have the same sta. Rangers need more HP(really they need to be on the same HP per lvl gain as SK/PALLY). Both can hit 1100ac with ease so having 1234 to 1115 dose not matter. The higher caps are nice but you can't count on that for tanking, only thing that can be is HP & AC, thats it. Yes we have a higher weapon skill then you in most things but we pay for that by not having spells. Kick dose less damage then bash. Crits are nice add on to the damage that we may deal, MAY as in can't count on it. Berserk the only good thing about this is that we may crip when we are berserk, MAY crip not will crip, but there is also a plus to str which dose nothing really at any lvl pass 20. Dual Weild hey take away duel weild & hybrids will have to tank no matter what, we can't out taunt you with out it now, even then taunting is so hit/miss. There is a plus to not having duel weild you get to use a sheild to get the ac off it & to boot bash( which can stun & can do more damage then kick).<P><BR>&gt;&gt;There is no way a Paladin/SK will ever get choiced over a Warrior so why is this a problem for you? <BR>Paladins/SKs have really hard time to tank those Sebilis mobs, and lets not start to talk about Velious... <BR>So instead of complaining on the new benefits that hybrids might get, focus on fixing your taunt. That is the only thing you need improved in my opinion&lt;&lt;<P>Soon you will get pick over us for tanking spots in groups if you can deal more damage or heal your self some what & tank as well as a warrior.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am a Gnome Warr of the 52 Circle and I feel fine with.<P>I would like to change the following things.<P>1. Let the drop rate of Cobalt as it is but create a new armor for warrior which is no drop but a small part better than crafted. This should be dropped in places like Sebilis, Karnor ... and it should not drop so often than some SS parts but in a way that warrior who do not have the opportunity to spent lots of time in Hate or other raid places have the chance to get a bit better equippment than crafted is. Or maybe make a quest of it in form of a advanced crafted so you must give in your crafted BP and some other stuff and get a "polished" Crafted BP ( 27 AC 7 STA 5 STR ) or something in that way. But make this armor and also all the other high lev Stuff only wearable for warr over level 45.<P>So it would be possible for a warrior post 45 to get some nice stuff without beeing a member of a greater guild only with a small group ... <P>Make some more Parts wearable by smaller Races. We have a real malus in form of less str sta .. and we are not able to equipp lots of the high str Items. I would like to have some special parts for small races like the bullsmasher or something in that way.<P>Give disarm a better taunt component and let it work also on level 50+ mobs which are yellow to the tank and lots of tanking probs are done. All other clases who are also able to disarm just had to live with that problem *eg*. Hey when I would be a figter and someone disarmed me I would be very very angry about that and for sure that one would be my main target.<P>Critical hits should be come more possible in higher levels and it would be nice if there could be a stun component in. Same for Cripplings. And I would like to get them a bit earlier in life post level 40 maybe with 5 % live more and in 50 next 5 % more so it would raise the damage output a bit and also raise the taunt a bit.<P>Berserker mode would be a fine part as a discipline but is not nessessary I think. Just give us a bit more time in berserk and finish it after starting not so early .. I hate it to go berserk and get a CH and berserk is gone in 5 seconds. Let it run for about 15 to 30 seconds after CH .. maybe give us then a "nerf" of beeing a bit tired and so hitting not so much as normal for a small amount of time ( not 1 minute only so 10 to 20 sec ). So berserk gives the possibility to deal good damage and after it there is a time to deal less damage. <P>Kilaara Drachenfliege<BR>Gnome Champion (52) <BR>Da Basherle of the CoH/SolRo<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>After reading all these posts. Yes everyone of them I decided to put forth my opinion. I have played an Iksar Warrior to level 60, I have 100+ days play time, and also have my Epic. I have almost a complete set of berserker armor and all of my gear is top notch. I have few complaints about my class and really believe that the warrior is the definition of Tank. However, at the endgame on the high end I have noticed a few problems with the class that I think need to be addressed:<BR>1) I have approximately 1200 AC unbuffed. It appears that AC is soft capped at 1100 AC. Any hybrid expending some effort can easily attain 1100AC. Therefore, my question is, why allow AC greater than 1100 if it does nothing more to ehance a tanks ability to absorb damage. I know that AC is a value derived from 2 components (a ratio of ability to avoid taking a hit and how much damage can be absorbed when hit). I have worked hard to max both my AGI and AC components and still notice little difference if any from 1100 to 1260. If indeed this AC is meaningless, then what is the difference between a Hybrid and a Warrior in the damage absorption department? I know there is a few hundred Hp difference, which in most end game encounters buys me a few seconds. Perhaps this "soft cap" is the current problem with Warriors and should be the issue addressed first. Otherwise, what good is all the extra AC that is supposed to make warrior superior in tanking over other classes? Essentially this means the only difference in tanking ability between warrior and hybrids is HP. Warriors do not get a significant difference...maybe enough HP to last at most 2 seconds longer. In some cases this may help since a Cheal is 10 seconds long, and a warrior might be able to last long enough for the cleric to get his heal off. Then again, maybe not. The margin is too close in my opinion. The AC softcap only aggravates this situation.<P>2) Stat buffs from other classes (e.g. Strength, Dex, etc) have very little impact on Warrior performance. I don't understand why 20 points of strength only results in the rare possibility that I will do maybe 1 or 2 points more damage in a hit or maybe I might have a few percentage points more chance of my weapon procing in combat (which is very necessary in my case as I have the Warrior Epic, and the delay is so high that I need the proc to taunt). I think stat buffs on warriors should contribute more than they do to the Warrior's effectiveness. This way they wouldn't be overbalanced as a solo class but would be able to do their job as intended: Tank and keep aggro. If dexterity buffs actually contributed a bit more to Crits/crips and weapon procs maybe the tank in the end game would have a chance of keeping aggro. I have begun to question the actual usefulness of stat buffs all together. I noticed that I do 11 more points of damage on my max damage when buffed at 255 Strength verses being at 150ish strength. 100 points of strength buys me the possibility of doing 11 more points on a maximum damage blow (which is not common by any means) and perhaps the mana efficiency/ added effectiveness involved really isn't worth the buffs. Anyway, this isn't really a warrior issue, but a general gripe about the game design.<P>3) The warrior EPIC. This weapon is already being bagged by some of the players on VEESHAN server. The delay is just too damn high. The plus side is the proc does get the mob on me almost every damn time and is great in that respect, however with the high delay there aren't nearly as many opportunities for the weapon to proc. I really think this weapon needs to be tweaked. I have the toughest time getting aggro off my SKs/Paladins and they don't even have their epics. I know they need to control their aggro, but often times we have an SK pulling, and its his initial aggro of the pull alone that often keeps him high on the hatelist. I won't even begin to mention the problems with taunting off Monk/Rogues with their epics. I just pray for a proc early in the fight or else they get a beating. I want the AC debuff component to remain in the EPIC, and here is why for all those warriors that don't understand...AC debuffs are HUGE taunt. Thats why my SK partner gets beaten silly like a Red-headed stepchild. That AC debuff is essential and I DON'T want to see it gone. I would prefer that AC debuff over any haste. PLEASE fix the stacking problem with 2hs/1hs but DO NOT remove the debuff. I think either it just needs to proc more or it needs to have the delay lowered by a few points.<P>4) Leave disarm alone. Its a great tool. I use it in conjunction with taunt to keep aggro.<P>5) Leave taunt alone. It seems to work just fine. DON'T make taunt AOE. That would really mess up the CC. If you make it AOE, make it optional or as another ability. I would prefer taunt remains single target over AOE. If you aren't interested in putting better low delay weapons in the game to help warriors maintain or even acquire top of hate list fix the hate list process itself. Too many times I have seen half my guild get wiped to pieces because I couldn't get aggro. Sometimes I have seen my Shamans get ripped to shreds in the middle of an encounter just by casting Cannabalize and nothing else while I have been taunting like mad and pounding away on the mob. The hate list definitely has problems in the high end of the game. However, I do think Monks/Rogues/Hybrids should be held responsible for their aggro. I don't mean to suggest that Warriors get increased Taunt to fix the lack of skill of players using these classes. I just think some caster that uses a virtually benign spell shouldn't become the target of a mobs affections over a warrior pounding the heck out of the mob. <P>6) Lower the refresh time on a few of the disciplines. 1 hour between use on many of them makes them completely unattractive. I find myself using only 1 discipline 99% of the time (Defensive). Aggressive is broken and entirely useless.<P><BR>A brief recap of my suggestions/gripes:<P>1) Make AC effective at 1100+. <BR>2) Make stat buffs actually make a noticable difference. Right now the difference is almost negligible.<BR>3) Lower the delay slightly on the Warrior Epic. DO NOT remove the debuff component, just fix the stacking issue. This debuff is great for taunt.<BR>4) Leave Disarm alone. It works fine.<BR>5) Leave taunt alone. Do NOT make an AOE taunt as a replacement for taunt. Instead, look at the game mechanics of the hate list.<BR>6) Some disciplines have refresh rates that are so long that the discpline is almost never used. The fix to Aggressive/Defensive is a welcome one.<P>Sleestakk<BR>Iksar Warlord (The first on any server)<BR>Guild Leader of Pravus Dei<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

They should get a second taunt skill around level 40 or 45 that they can use.. make it a 15 minute reuse time or something.. but make it a hard enough taunt to get a mob turned around from a healer instantly.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Won't do no good but here goes-<P>Warriors just suck in this game period.  Sorry, but they do.  A meat shield I don't want to be.  I want to dish out and take damage-not just recieve.  More hit points-well when mobs start smacken you around for 100+ a few hundred more hp's mean nothing.  Its also pretty easy to see that if you can do more damage you don't need as many hp's/as much ac/so much great gear-the fight doesn't last as long.  Critcal hits and Crip hits-awesome idea, but they never happen enough nor are they reliable enough to ever count on for squat.  Look isn't that cute, my normal hit with this weapon is in the 60's-wow I just 'critically' hit for 57-woopy.  Doesn't sound to critical-sorry.  Wee we get great disciplines-great but at the rate you can use em-more eye candy.  Better gear....yeah yeah blah blah try getting some of this better gear.  At level 55 I had one piece of cobalt, 2 piece's of indi, and the rest was crafted I've had since the dawn of time.  Weapons were not in much better shape.  I've played many classes since my warrior-all into there 20's and 30's.  Simple fact of EQ life...if you can't cast you aint nothing-course monks can fd so no worries and a rogue has hide/sneak.  The game is hard and tedious without spells.  Heck I can still solo some red cons in my 30's with my two casting classes (necro/wizzy)-my warrior could never do that.  Heck most greens can give my warrior fits now.  Anyway, flame away, bash on, I don't care-Verant doesn't care-and I hope the next serious of online games gives us 'masters of combat' something more to look forward.  I'm off to read about all the great fixes my new love will get in the game-wizard-yeah you know the dude, the one who can never get a group cause he sucks in his own special way to  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ABSOR WHERE ARE YOU?<P>Ok, I just had to post one last time about something that I have seen people complain a lot about on here. Crits and Crips. First off, I agree that they're pretty much just eye candy, and I've never really seen it make a difference. (i.e. I get a crit for say, 38 points and the mob is stunned or turns and runs... he just keeps swinging away like normal.) I don't know if it has any effects in combat. Perhaps Absor could clarify this if he ever posts again. <P>With that said, I must say I am tired of posts that complain about the amount of damage that crits and crips do. Some believe that a critical hit *HAS* to do more damage than the highest regular hit they usually get. That is just stupid. Think of it this way: Someone punches you in the face as hard as they can. Sure, that would hurt. Now, instead of hitting you as hard as possible, they just give you a quick jab with a finger to your eye. They didn't hit you nearly as hard, but you're hurt more because they hit you in a sensitive spot. There is no rule in EQ or anywhere that says a critical or crippling hit absolutely HAS to do the MOST damage of any other hit. That is just flawed logic. I agree that crips should make a difference in combat, but they don't have to have outragous amounts of damage every single time. <P>Every once in a while I do get a crip for a lot more than I usually hit for. This usually draws comments like "Wow, nice hit." I don't know how much others I group with hit for, becuase I've turned thier combat info off. (otherwise the info flies by so fast you can't read it) I couldn't care less if some monk is out damaging me, or a caster nukes for three times as much as I hit for. As long as the mob dies, we live, and I get my XP... I am happy. <P>But no matter how much I agree or disagree with previous posts, I still think that we deserve a little bit of attention (i.e. a reply!) from Absor. Come on man, so you posted and got flamed by some. Is that really the reason you don't reply? Seems like a tantrum to me. It's not like your hosting a free website and this forum is taking time away from a busy life. This is your job, and you're getting paid. Grow up, and respond to your paying customers. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I also want to add to my above post.<P>Verant works really hard to try to force us all to play in groups, so they have made the MOB's and NPC's live by different laws of physics as players (Would not happen in any edition D&D).<P>With balance like I demonstrated above, there would be no problems creating encounters that absolutely required different combinations of classes to form parties to overcome.

</FONT><HR>*******Hey Absor read this it is important.*******<BR>500 hp means nothing when you're fighting a mob that quads for 300+... Just have to trust in clerics. I don't think this area needs improvement. Defensive is a good way to deal with this issue. <P>As for taunting... Yes I agree with the majority of people here...Taunting must be fixed. I am a level 53 warrior. Soon as the enchanter hits tash it takes 3 or 4 taunts to get it off. By that time the enchanter could be dead.<P>For taunt raise the skill and make it add more hate to the hate list please. Even if it won't work on white or higher mobs that's fine. Just let it work on the mobs that are blue to us.<BR>We're supposed to be taking damage... How can we do that when the mob is hitting a caster more often than me?<P>Another solution I feel would be good...<P>Put phantom damage in...Everytime you miss a mob, damage that would have been normally done will be done to add to the hate list. The targets HP will not be effected by the phantom damage (misses).<BR>This will increase the hate list very high. Something that would improve taunting ability for warriors.<P>Sk's and paly's can aggro things with their dots/debuffs.<BR>Paly's can aggro things well with their stuns.<BR>Rangers easily outdamage us but a good ranger makes good use of their jolt spell.<BR>So I'm not concerned about that. My bigged concern however is the taunting ability of warriors. It needs to be fixed, everyone agrees.<P>We would like some feedback on this Absor...<BR>Please respond to our posts. We're posting and posting without any kind of response.

</FONT><HR>SK/Pally vs Warriors<P>Oh Lord!  Warriors, please read carefully and understand.<P>It is patent fact that warriors by far, even with spells, outdamage SKs and Paladins.  Sks/Pallys really cannot compete in damage done.  They shouldn't.  This is an advantage warriors have over SKs/Pallys.<P>There are FOUR defensive areas where Warriors have an edge over Pallys/SKs.<P>HP  -  Levels 55+  Warriors have from 400 to 800 more HP than SKs/Pallys... Pally buffs don't count, cause they won't stack with the buffs we all get from clerics.<P>AC  -  Warrior armor at all levels have more AC than Pally/SK armor.  With the soft cap in AC this is less of an advantage, but it still allows warriors more slots for stat items or resist gear.<P>Skills  -  Defense(pending change), Parry, Riposte, Dodge.  Warrior caps in these skills are higher (much higher in some cases) than Pally/SKs.  Only defense directly relates to AC.  So, since Hybrids can already reach the soft cap of 1100, it doesn't help much.  Parry, Riposte, Dodge don;y effect AC.  They negate an attack that the MoB "rolled" as a hit.  This means that even with the exact sam AC an SK/Pally will always take more damage than a warrior.  MAJOR advantage - warrior<P>Disciplines  -  This is the nail in the coffin for Pally/SK tanking in deep Sebilis, Kunark Ubermobs, and upper level Velious MoBs.  A tanks job is to absorb damage at a slower rate than the other party members would while still delivering a bit of damage.  With the defensive discipline a warrior takes 33 percent less damage.  That is huge.  Against the MoBs that triple and quad for 500+, that is the only way to stay alive long enough to receive heals.  Also, for Mobs that can be nuked down in 45 sec or less, warriors with the riposte discipline can engage in waves and take NO damage.  SK/Pallys have no way to tank these mobs and are usually considered a bandwidth liability.<P>So please see that an increase in the defensive cap for SK/Pallys in no way makes up equal to you.  In fact it does a lot less than Verant thinks it will do because of the AC soft cap.<P>SKs/Pallys don't want to tank as well as warriors.  But we want to be able to tank some.  If a warrior can tank a mob for 1 minute before needing a heal, we would like to be able to do it for 45 seconds.  SK/Pallys want our relative ability to tank restored to Pre-Kunark levels.<P>The hard part about that is how to do it.  Because of Verants' stance on not giving Hybrids disciplines, they will be forced to up hybrid skills.  Even if SKs/Pallys have equal skills to a warrior, we still couldn't tank uber MoBs.  Then the situation would be screwed, because SK/Pallys could tank regular MoBs 98 percent as well as warriors but still suck at uber mobs.  Verant needs to see this and just give SK/Pallys a mild increase in parry, riposte, dodge, say +15 points, and also give us some damage reducing ability that has a reuse timer, recast delay, usable on uber mobs.<P>Even with the changes I mention in the last paragraph warriors will:<P>Do MUCH more damage that Pally/SKs<BR>Take less damage<BR>Have better AC at all levels<BR>Have more HP at all levels<BR>Have better resistances at all levels<BR>Tank Uber mobs MUCH better<P>Warriors are THE best tanks in Norrath.  That is the way it should be.  Paladins and Shadowknights just want to be at the point where we can still be called tanks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

At first i was a little confused, then i realized something. . .  the shadowknights in the area where grouping with the group i used to be with with there pets.  i realize that there pets are very low level, but when fighting skeles in the pit, a pet can help with both dishing out and taking damage, to the point where sk become more useful (along with spells) than warriors.<P>One simple solution is to raise taunt, i have sat by and watched as friends died while i pushed the hell out of my taunt button to no prevail.<P>Second, i know this doesn't affect me so much now, but i would love to see better armor for iksar warriors, and warrior only armor in general.<P>Thank to anyone who reads this.<P>and to anyone who understands and relates</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I love playing warriors but let's face it - in most cases other melee types are just as good for a group.<P>The only thing that really seperates a warrior from other types is their ability to taunt.  Despite their increased abilities to deal out damage, rangers and monks just don't seem to do this fast enough.<P>If what higher level players say is indeed true that you cannot taunt at higher levels. Then, I think a correction needs to be made to their taunting ability at those levels.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have a Level 56 Barbarian Warrior.<P>14 months ago after playing a few different classes to level 10, I decided that I'd rather focus on being a melee class, in particular the melee class charged with focusing the mobs attention on me. I chose to be a warrior.  Why is the warrior the best at this?  Well at the time it was supposed to be because of the fact that we had superior HP and AC.  Why could we attract the attention of the mobs?  Because we could do enough damage and taunt, so we could stay on the mobs hate list.<P>Why did I choose a Barbarian?  To have more HP.  What did I sacrifice and gain by being a Barbarian?  I sacrificed decent night vision, I have a hard time moving around in certain places and I have an xp penalty.  I gained more HP and the ability to slam, thus interrupting spells, without using a shield.<P>What did I sacrifice by being a warrior.  I sacrificed every form of independence possible.  I am completely dependent on a group, for both travel and combat.  I have no spells.  I have no skills other then taunt, disarm (when does a warrior use this other then duals?) and slam.  I can't invis myself, heal myself, fall dead, snare or root a mob when I'm in trouble, sneak or hide, harmony, SoW, etc.<P>What were supposed to be the rewards for these sacrifices?  To be THE damage taker.<P>What happened to me because of this?  Until level 50 when I really began to shine I waited on lists, sometimes 4 hours to get xp.  Hybrids, druids, necros, shamans, mages could solo at these levels, not efficiently, but I would have loved to have spent those hours sitting in the corner of the tiger room waiting, to be instead killing something every 15 minutes.  I died frequently traveling because I had no get out of jail free card.<P>So now I'm level 56.  When I go to a dungeon people want me in a group usually to take one spot out of the 6 available.  Because I can take the damage and stand. This supremacy in the damage taking ability was supposed to be (according to what verants stance used to be) my reward for having no independance, no spells and no skills. <P>Post level 50 I found that I could not taunt anymore.  So what did I do?  I killed 20 dragons and camped Drovalrg Tower until level 55 to get jade maces and an RBB.  Two of the fastest weapons in the game and one of the best haste items.  Without weilding these weapons I can't taunt to save my clerics life.  I have had Sunderfury for 6 weeks now.  I've used it a total of 6 times.  I do a lot more damage with it, then dual wielding, but I can't taunt with it.  Thus it sits in my evil eye bag for the odd times when there are two warriors in the group and I want to increase damage output.<P>Druids and necros are constantly throwing fits now that they are not more "desired" post 50.  Go to skyfire and burning woods in kunark.  What are these two zones filled with?  Druids and Necros, soloing. I'd love to be able to Quad Kite in BW and get solo xp when I can't find a group (which happens all the time due to the sheer number of people that play).  I'd love to have a pet that can tank in skyfire and get me xp.<P>This uncompromising supremecy in HP/AC that every non-warrior is flaming about is untrue.  I group with paladins, rangers and SK's frequently from my guild.  A 54 human paladin in my guild has 200 less HP then me (a barbarian warrior) and 12 less AC (yes this is unbuffed).  Go tank a frog in sebelis with that difference in stats and tell me the difference it makes.  Yes I can dodge and parry better, but how often does that really happen?<P>The pallie and I both have several planar pieces...but he has FOUR DW pieces while I have one cobalt piece.  Why?  Cobalt NEVER drops, ever.  I leveled 5 times in DT to get cobalt gaunts.  I've killed 200 callers of sathir, never seen boots.  I've seen 5 sinoches partisans though.  I've seen countless pairs of singing steel gaunts, DW gaunts/boots, jaundiced bone, druid vambraces etc.  There are less cobalt bracers on my server then cobalt BP's.<P>Yeah we have better AC items...you try and get them.<P>I had to level 5 times and increase my AC by 120 to see a big differece in the damage I was taking in KC...the AC difference after these proposed hybrid defensive increases will be 40 AC (which means about 60 in actuality) between an SK/Pallie and a warrior (the pallie/SK and warriors being in full kunark class armor).  They will be close to me in damage due to the fact that they can use 2h and do their jobs, while I MUST do 1h to do mine.<P>"A warrior has SUPERIOR choices in armor and equipment"<P>No not really, we have more choices but not superior ones.  And if I have to dual weild 50k worth of weapons such as 2 jade maces, 2 lamentations or 2 blood points to do my job and taunt, how is that a choice?  Further, I have 960 AC now...I'll be damn near the 1100 AC soft cap after I get full planar and level a little more.  What is the point of my class defining cobalt then?  It won't do me any good.  The spells on it are useless except for the greaves and the bracer...the planar stats are more useful.<P>There are many Ranger/SK/Paladin weapons that are superior to warrior weapons, they just don't fall off of trees.<P>"Warriors have Disciplines"<P>Yes we do, most of them are useless.  So I can land every hit for 14 seconds, so I can riposte every attack for 15 seconds and then wait an hour to do that again.  So what?  The only warrior discipline that is very useful is the 55 discipline, defensive.  I take less damage but do less, which means I have to not use it at first so that I make sure I get on the mobs hate list before I am ready to take reduced damage.<P>The main problem with hybrids, is they all want to be warriors and have spells.  Everything is compared to warriors.  I invite hybrids all the time that actually know how to play their class.  Paladins can heal in a pinch, tank when I'm LoM, root, undead nuke.  Rangers can out pull me anyday with their spells and they do good damage.  SK's can out pull me as well with their invis, FD, and tank when needed.<P>If hybrids want to be improved I think their spell casting abilites should be enhanced.  They have unique abilites that almost none of them use (in my experience), that is supposed to be their advantage.<P>If you want to "balance" the warrior and other classes, making the hybrids shift to better melees is not the solution.  Give them more mana and more spells.  As it is they are 80% melee and 25% their parent caster class.<P>As far as what I would like to see balanced for warrior:<P>1)  You have to do something about how taunting is computed.  I'm a fairly high warrior, I have some very good equipment.  I can't taunt a lot of times.  There is something wrong with that if taunting is supposed to be one of my strong points.<P>2)  The epic weapons.  Risk vs. reward for starters.  The delay is too high for the 1h weapons.  Not condusive at all for taunting until it's lowered.  People keep saying that the proc will make it taunt. Procs are too elusive and unreliable to be depended upon for taunting.  I have one of the 2 hardest quests and my class defining weapon will not be condusive to my one purpose for being?  That's not reward for the risk.<P>You need to increase the drop rate for the maestro and the queen.  Yes epic weapons are supposed to be difficult.  Try to form a hate raid these days.  That's difficult.  It's camped 24/7.  I've killed the maestro 5 times and never seen a hand.   One of the uber guilds on my server gates up like clock work every 24 hours to kill the maestro if hate is not occupied...they still after months of doing this haven't got enough hands for half of their less then 10 warriors.  The queen of chardok and a 15% drop rate?  You gotta be kidding me.  It's hard enough to kill the queen.  I need to find 30 people willing to sit in a tunnel for 24 hours (and die a few times) to cough up ONE blade?  Even if the drops on these items were more common the warrior epic would still be one of the most difficult...the drop rates make it hands down most difficult and I would argue insanely difficult.  <P>One other issue with the epic blade that doesn't really concern me, but many warriors is slam.  Why do pallies and SK's get the ability to slam with their epics and a small race warrior wielding his does not?  This is balace?  A parent class weilding their class defining weapon does not have the ability to do something that the hybrid can? <P>3) Increase Cobalt armor drop rates.  If this armor is supposed to be our advantage then we are definitly not seeing it's advantages.<P>4) If you increase hybrid offense/defense and don't fix a thing, then things will become unbalanced.  They will have much easier access to equipment to make them have very silimlar stats to warriors as far as AC/HP in the SK/Pallie arena.  If you increase Ranger offense and don't fix taunt they will die.<P>Things are balanced now for the most part.  Give hybrids a reason to use their spells and abilites more, that is what they are supposed to be, melees/casters not mostly melees/very little caster.<P>Hybrids are fine the way they are now as far as their melee stats.  They have UNIQUE abilites.  They can heal, life tap, snare, root, debuff, DoT, nuke, summon pets, fall dead, track summon corpses, invis, the list goes on. They aren't totally group dependent like warriors are.  The have spells.  They should learn to capitolize on their abilities and spells.  90% of them do not.  The should get the superior class only equipment available to them.  Giving them more spells and mana would benefit them the most.  They are supposed to be a challenge to play.  They have already had their xp penalty removed.<P>On a side note, you need to make wizard spells cost less mana.  2 ice comets per fight isn't all that great.  Many druids out damage the wizards I play with.  Wizards don't get the buffs and heals they do.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First off, the current hp differece between warriors and hybrids is meaningless at higher levels if everyone is either fully and equally buffed, or fully and equally naked. Even the optimists, and lapdogs of Verant would likely concede that AC and hp are now the ONLY "advantage" warriors have, because the effect of disciplines are almost non-existent. I beg to differ. Warriors now have no advantage at all.<P>3600hp vs 3300hp? vs 3200hp?<P>When stuff multihits for 160+, that's roughly one extra round (2 seconds worth) of life. Wow. Increase warrior hitpoints by 30% to see the first meaningful shred of a dent in lifespan, not to mention to create a clear and undeniable DISTINCTION between warriors and the soon to be warriors-with-spells.<P>Disciplines, lets see... the resistance can is useful, but warriors are not unique in having it. Fearless is ok for dragon raids, but in order to use it, you have to give up using something more useful. Defensive disciplines? Trading offense for defense more often than not (my observation) will get the casters of your party killed in a jiffy due to lessened ability to aggro back onto you after the "crisis" is over - and we all know how (NON)effective taunt still is on 50+ mobs. Make them useful by granting defensive bonuses without offensive penalty. Make the offensive disciplines useful by negating the defense hit. Speaking of which, most of the offensive disciplines seem next to worthless anyway, unless you follow the Verant Flock like a good little sheep and use low delay 1H weapons. Example:<P>I used my new Critical Hit discipline (arguably one of the most commonly used) 8 times against various mobs during the raid in Sky yesterday. I was weilding a 33/44 2HB weapon (Truncheon of Doom) with maxed offense and 2HB skills for lvl 54, 200 str, Speed of the Shissar, AND a Cloak of Flames. What were the results?<P>1) Whiffed 6 times, crit for 60 and 80. Joy.<BR>2) Timed it when berzerk (YAY!). Casters decided it was a good time to play PONG.  *sigh*  An hour wait...<BR>3) Whiffed 4 times, crit for 40, 20 (kick), 164, 106. Keep in mind, I can hit for an observed max of 171 on a NON-crit.<BR>4) Whiffed *8* times in a row!! Poor.<BR>5) Pong... AGAIN! Downright poor.<BR>6) MORE PONG! Way to waste 2 HOURS worth of discipline recharge time! Discipline recharge times are rather obscene, btw.<BR>7) Non-berzerk, but something did not work right. I hit the discipline, and got a critical kick in (yay), then the next 6 hits were NORMAL, THEN I get the a message saying I lose the concentration to blah, blah, blah. Something's broken; this is not the first time it's happened to me.<BR>8) Timed it so I was berzerk, and actually made contact *6* times (2 kicks)! NONE of the crippling hits broke 160, however. Unreal.<P>I don't wanna hear anything about ppl saying war disciplines are the best thing since sliced bread. The only way disciplines become useful is if you fit the mold of Verant's Warrior and use low delay 1H weapons, essentially crippling any meaningful attempt to RP your character as a 2H fighter without making yourself useless to the people who depend on you to keep them alive, the people who need you to help them make daily groups and major raids successful. It's times like this that I want to give up trying to RP. If that happens, I'll likely leave the game - because being able to EFFECTIVELY (notice the stress on that word) play EQ the way *I* want is why I play my class.<P>On to AC... now, this might have been the ONLY redeeming factor, but since the caps are going to be "fixed," AC will now merely come down to equipment. In other words, whatever warrior or soon to be warrior-with-spells can afford to waste more hours camping the longest, or has a guild lucky and powerful enough to beatdown Trak on a regular basis, or can afford to shell out obscene amounts of cash for the best gear has the best AC.  Nice.<P>I firmly believe that this is Verant's way of getting people to "balance out" the classes. They must feel that there are too many warriors out there, and not enough hybrids... how to fix? Give the hybrids about the same combat abilities, make their spells sweeter, ignore the hp discrepancy.<P>Most nerfs I can understand, and have a basis on SOME form of logic. Most boosts to various classes have some shred of reason embedded in them SOMEWHERE. This, however, seems intended to serve no purpose, other than to chafe most of the players of one of EQ's core classes. One of Verant's old mantras was that the hybrid exp penalty was justified by the additional abilities (casting, LoH, HT) of each hybrid class. A while ago, they did the right thing and fixed the hybrid manapool problem. Then they gave rangers criticals with bows - a token change; not enough, imo - the same goes for token increase ability of LoH and HT. They should have done more there; emphasized what made you hybrids unique. Recently, an awesome major change was made to the exp. system to make the system more fair. In addition to this, now their abilities are being augmented?<P>I'm happy for the hybrids, don't get me wrong. I'm glad that they are getting some things they have been crying out for for a LONG, LONG time. I just wish Verant didn't make these changes at the expense of the warrior class. The druid and sham boosts do not seem to be encroaching on anywhere near the abilities of the clerics. Keeps everyone happy, there; no one feels their identity infringed upon. I don't know what the heck Verant is thinking when they don't draw that same line with the impending change to hybrids.<P>Suggestions:<BR>Give us a 25-30% increase in HP, across all levels.<BR>Increase all offensive and defensive caps to 252.<BR>Increase the critical hit rate by 15-20% post 50.<BR>Increase 2H weapon dmg., minimum AND max; emphasis on minimum.<BR>Give kick a minimum dmg equal to lvl/2.  Kicking for 1 dmg at lvl 54 is downright pointless.<BR>Give us an AE taunt.  It would be a much needed class-defining addition.<BR>For crying out loud, lower the reuse delay on the disciplines (maybe -3 minutes per level would be more reasonable).  Increasing the duration by 10% wouldn't hurt, either, imo.  Eliminate defensive penalties for offensive disciplines, and offensive penalties for defensive disciplines.<BR>Add more mid and high level hammers and axes; I'm a Dwarf, dammit.  Give us some variety so we can RP.  Same goes for armor.  How am I supposed to have any sense of identity when everyone and his/her brother has cobalt, crafted and/or indico??<BR>How about giving warriors a class-based increase in learning curve for smithing, so we can feasibly make some of that high lvl cultural armor that is STILL put to shame by most dropped armor in either expansion pack?<P>I guess, warriors, we now play the "wait and see" game... and hope they restore our identity, restore some of the reasons that make us proud of being a warrior.<P>A very bewildered and disappointed, <P>Steele Stouthammer, 54 Dwarven Warrior <BR>The Hostess Twinkie of Brell Serilis <BR>Patriarch of Clan Stouthammer <BR>Elder Council, Requiem of Souls<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
