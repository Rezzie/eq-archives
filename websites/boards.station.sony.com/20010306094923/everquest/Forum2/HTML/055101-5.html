</FONT><HR>We need to increase the monk damage significantly but I do not want some cute-sey special attack. I want a more fundamental way for this to be increased.<P>One thing that I do not want to do is the need press 5 diffent keys to increase my damage. That's why I HIGHLY suggest a triple attack over linking 5 special keys. If they want to add cute then they can do that AFTER they fundamentally increase our damage output and NOT WITH AN EPIC weapon.<P>Second, if you have not read my post about our SIGNIFICANT reduction in overall defense versus over pure melee classes post ROK then I suggest you do so. (Page 3)<P>We need compensation for this LOST. I suggest a "new" defense skill - Parry? Or something like reposte but more Monk like. Counter attack (Block the attack and do return damage)  Monks should be experts in blocking an Opponents attack then countering it with a return hit - maybe even a stun?<P>We need a increase in our HPS. Being an upfront in your face pure melee - we should have significant more hps. Especially with our huge lost in defense compared to the other pure melee classes after ROK. I'm not asking for damage aborption - which is what a tank has with thier INSANE AC. I'm asking for Avoidance and  comparable Hps (I'm not asking for 4,000 hps but in the ball park... NOT HALF of a warrior hps either we need at least 80% of thier hps)- to make up for our HUGE decrease relative to other pure classes in DEFENSE skills after ROK.<P>We have bad armor, we have signicant wt restriction and we have horrible hps - way too low for a up front pure melee.<P>Ridge Deforce</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Krell,<P>thanks for the feedback.<P>I was looking at the situation as more of an absolute situation versus comparative.<P>If gloves existed, that had the ability to give us the hand to hand style of combat at the staff damage levels, we could overcome StaffQuest and actually BE the monks we wanted to be. <P>How a series of gloves would be set to give these abilities from a progressive acquisition level is a deeper discussion if the premis hold water to begin with.<P>I honestly do not want an item in my primary or secondary slot.  I want gloves and boots that effect my ability to punch and kick.  By making them gloves, perhaps ones that have as their ultimate incarnation the Celestial Fists, we both solve the issue of using two at once and fit into an overall vision of monks using their fists.  <P>Imagine the variety.  What if some gloves existed that helped speed a lot but not much on damage.  And other gloves helped with damage but not with speed.  One set of gloves might be 14/24 while another is 7/18 while yet another is 16/30.  The variety would be easy to implement and they could represent stages of growth for monks.  I do not want to focus on the end game only.  Rather something that all monks go through as they start and grow and evolve.  <P>(Ideally the gloves would not be an absolute "this makes your primary hand a 10/30 and your secondary a 12/36" but rather instead additive "This glove makes your primary +2 damage and -1 speed and your secondary +1 damage and -1 speed" kind of thing.  Heck, they could even carry negatives to give us a secondary hand of 30/40 if you just wanted to play with flavors.)<P>I do not want to be using a jade mace and a SOS, I want to be using "Gloves the Tranquil" that give me stats that are the equilivent.  <P>Additional variety could come in the form of gloves that do siffertent things to your primary and secondary hands.  Just imagine the possibilities for different flavors.<P>Have fun out there and good luck yall.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi,<BR>I like alot of these ideas posted on the boards.  I have played all classes but 4 to at least lvl 30 and I have to say by far the monk is my favorite, or was untill Kunark came out with all these ubber mid to high lvl high ac and high attack items for Warriors and others melee types.  I really believe our attack skills need to increase faster per lvl and have a higher lvl cap.  What I suggest for more dmg if you didn't want to put in triple attack or some combo attack is you should raise the offense skill per lvl to 7 instead of 5.  Another suggestion if you want us to be more hand and fist orientated for weapons then do the same for the hand to hand combat make that move up 7 skill points per lvl instead of 5.  That would be very easy to implement in the game with out having to make major changes.  Another suggestion made by others which I totally agree with is PLEASE put a minimum dmg on our skills, its pretty silly useing a special skill and hitting for only 2 points!!  Need I say more on that.<BR>Ok now for my BIGGEST beef of all on monks.  Who the heck designs the weapons and armour for monks and assigns such a HIGH weight on these items.  I'd like to know what they are smoking!!  Maybe these people should actually go out and play a monk for couple of months and see what the problem is.  Here is and example of the nice new items they implemented for trade skills (great ideas Guys) the Reinforced Black Panther Skin items for monks.  CHECK OUT THE HIGH WEIGHTS on these peices:<P>Black Panther Skin             Weight<P>      Boots                      1.5<BR>      Legs                       3.0<BR>      Tunic                      2.5<BR>      Cloak                      1.5<BR>      Sleaves                    1.0<BR>      Shoulders                  1.0<P>TOTAL                            10.0<P>Now these are only half the items you need to wear and we are ALREADY up to 10 weight this is crazy and our max weight without penalty is 14 give me a break.  How are we even going to carry weight reducing bags (usually weigh 3 each), and then add all them bandages, shurikens, food and sometimes weapons??? You guys seriously need to address this issue like you did last year for the Shadow Knights.  The way I see it is it will be alot easier to just up our weight restriction rather than go back and change almost every monk item that is weighted way to high (which is most items).<BR>I really liked the one idea where someone suggested having your weight allowance go up with your lvl (as if your body is more skilled and tuned) so you can react and handle your self better with more weight as you advance in life/skill/lvl.<P>This is my first post EVER of playing everquest and I've been playing on one of my two accounts since one month after you started this.  I have never whined or cried about any of your changes and I actually agreed with most of them.  But since you decided to address classes this was my biggest chance to speak up about what I noticed as the biggest discrepancy in the game.<BR>Thankyou for your ear!<P>Tunare: Horek, Horekk, Cellen<BR>Test: Shadowice, Sshadowfist<BR>And many more names!!<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The monk does more damage and does fast damage to the mob keeping him high on the hate list, hence he receives most of the mobs attention.  The cleric will need to heal the monk more frequently for 2 reasons, less hit points, and higher agro (monk receives more damage).  Due to the low hit points of monks each heal cast on a monk is significantly less efficient than if it was on a warrior (like 1200hps to 2500hps).  Consequently the Cleric needs to spend more then twice the mana with the addition of the monk over a warrior.<P>Whats in it for the cleric to invite the monk?<P>Slightly faster mob death (maybe 5% faster for a monk/warrior team over a warrior/warrior team) for a significant decrease in mana efficiency.<P>Rogues and Rangers have abilities and spells to move themselves down hate list, and warriors back on top.

</FONT><HR>Adding more gloves to enhance hand to hand damage is a pretty solid idea.  Bear in mind, though, that the epic gloves are supposed to be the best weapon in the game for monks.  This is true for pretty much every other class' epics; from what I understand warriors may use their epic for situations where tanking is absolute priority and Velious weapons for when damage dealing is a bit more important.  This is a non-issue for monks, all our weapons do is deal damage.  Whatever is done, if you choose to solve the monk damage problem with gloves or other equipment, please don't forget to enhance our epic gloves to keep them on top.  If they can be coded to increase in damage as the wielder goes up in levels, that would be ideal.  That way a low 50s monk with celestial fists will do damage that is reasonable at his/her level, but a 60 monk will deal enough damage to outpace level 60 warriors with their highest damage weapons.  As has been stated several times before, rogues should still do more damage as long as they are landing successful backstabs.<BR>The idea of enhancing feign death to reduce aggro would be nice as well, though it should probably not work so dramatically as to outperform evade.  From what I understand, evade is being modified to drop the rogue a finite number of steps down on the aggro list... perhaps feign death could drop a monk down roughly half the number of steps that evade would drop a rogue, if it goes off successfully?  That seems like it would be balanced, taking into account the monk and rogue's other high level class abilities.<P>Arikel Callistrae<BR>Erollisi Marr Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I just want to comment that I agree with the statements about the Black Panterskin Armor. It is great armor, seeing that on the list makes me want to work on my tradeskills again.<P>It does weigh too much. If the total weight for a complete set was around 7.0 instead of 13.5 it would be FAR more useful. Most monks will not wear it because there are better items that weigh far less.<P>If you are going to give us these great items please remember that we have a VERY severe penalty for going over 14 stone. Either up the weight limit or drop the weight of the monk-only gear.<P>Add in the weight from our bags, food, ammunition and bandages and things start to get very prohibitive. 14 stone may have been great once but I think nobody bothered to really explain to the item design team what a weight of 1.5 means on a single item for us. Please take a look at it and re-evaluate it. It's prbably easier to give an increase instead of fixing all of the items, but fixing the items is a better fix from a roleplay perspective.<P>If you tie this increase to level (like 0.3 stone more per level for example) it will also keep Monks from using a lot of heavy gear early in their career, making it a bit tougher to twink.<P>Money is not light either... I'd love a feature that lets me auto-drop or auto-destroy gold, copper and silver.<P>It's tough enough to make money as it is when you can't carry any loot out of a dungeon because carrying it will slap you with a 100ac penalty. I understand non-monk gear weighing more, but the monk-only gear shouldn't weigh as much as it does.<P>Raviel Darkfyre<BR>Servant of the Tranquil<BR>45 Monk, Luclin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One possibility for a defense increase for monks would be to add (if it doesn't conflict in code) the alternate 'defense' to block as a monk skill as well, namely, 'parry'.<P>This would mean monks would dodge, block, parry, and riposte.<P>Probably more accurate than heavier armor itself.<P>Also, another idea entirely...<P>Monks are supposed to be 'non equipment dependent'.<P>How about a level based increase in stats?<P>Amount subject to question, but, given how little stats actually DO (grin), anything up to levelx1 would work, for strength, agility, dexterity, and stamina. (The monk 'preferred' stats)<P>I suppose level/2 is more likely to be acceptable, though.<P>Yeah, that means a level 60 monk gets a 'free' +30 to those stats.  Not all THAT much, considering, and VERY much in the line of the 'we improve our bodies, not our gear' description of monks.<P>PLEASE don't make 'enhancements' like this only for level 50+!<P>Enhancements (such as increased weight carried without penalty) should be ALL levels, slowly, not only for the uber-guild no-real-life people who can play 6 hours or more every day!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree whole-heartedly with Bodi's post, and support the Monkly-Business Community; I have only 'ever' been a monk- on 4 servers... having no real desire to be any other class.<P>Changes I would like to re-emphasize:<P>* All that is needed to "fix" Monks' overall damage output is to calculate the level-damage-bonus for the off-hand (and, YES, nerf the damn Moss Covered Twig for the good of the Monk Class) and add a minimum-damage to our discipline attacks (which should last slightly longer, or have their time-outs reduced).<P>Barring changes to Disciplines and a Damage Bonus to the Off Hand:<P>* Change the damage:delay ratio of our fists from levels 50-60; suggest 14/30-16/25.<BR>Lvl 50 = 14/30<BR>Lvl 52 = 14/29<BR>Lvl 55 = 14/28<BR>Lvl 56 = 15/28<BR>Lvl 57 = 15/27<BR>Lvl 58 = 15/26<BR>Lvl 59 = 15/25<BR>Lvl 60 = 16/25<P>Changes to Our Epic:<P>Make the Celestial Fists AC 20, and make them weigh 0.0- "20" as in 10 fingers on each hand *times* two- for dual weild (or 5 fingers on *one* hand x2; dual weild x2; double attack)... AC 15 is arbitrary and low considering the lack of a high level full-line of "Celestial" Quest Armor, and that Gauntlets of Dragon Slaying are indeed in the game (AC 25, WT 0.0, +9 STR/ETC/ETC).<P>Fix Celestial Tranquility by making it Spell Haste like our Robe of the Whistling Fists- for the reasons outlined in Bodi's post.<P>Lastly- the graphic is disappointing... I'd rather have a plain white or chrome looking pair of banded gauntlets that glow like a White_GBS or Essence of Dol... think "Bard Song"- like a "Hymn" particle-effect; afterall, Celestial Tranquility *will* be fixed to make it song-level Haste/AC/ATK *right* ???<P>Useful Changes that encourage keeping skills up:<P>I don't wish to see more "automatic" combinations, but would like to see our "old" skills be useful post-50; of utmost importance- having our Claw/Strike/(Rake)Punch skills "Crit" or Stun and our Round-Kick/Flying Kick have a % chance of stunning the target for "lvl/10" seconds (level differential of the target unchecked; but check MOB's Save-Vs.-Magic).<P>Also changes that would fix monks overall, while NOT unbalancing the class:<P>* Implement a Human and an Iksar do-able quest for a weight-reducing pack (10-slot, 50% or so) complete-able in mid-40's (NO DROP, LORE, of course).<P>* Make certain bandages weigh 0.1 (Geeeez- that is an old request!)<P>* Allow Monks to carry more post-50, since The Vision (tm) is Hell-bent on making Monks sneer at their MNK-only armor, in favor of the vastly-superior ALL/ALL stuff like Azure Sleeves, Golden Eefreeti, Girdle of Dwarfslaying, Phase Spider Carapace, etc. etc. etc. etc. !<P>* I know Verant isn't going to change our Kunark and Planes Armor - so implement a line of high-level Quest Armor (up the drops of dragon Scales if need be)... call it "Celestial" armor... in line with our Epic reward:<P>Chest AC 30, WT 0.3, +15 STR/STA/AGI/DEX/PR/DR, +90 HP Effect: Regeneration<P>Head  AC 20, WT 0.2, +10 STR/AGI/DEX/WIS/INT, +60 HP Effect: See Ultra/Invis<P>Arms  AC 14, WT 0.1, +15 STA/AGI/MR/FR/CR<P>Legs  AC 16, WT 0.2, +15 STR/DEX/PR/DR<P>Waist AC 12, WT 0.1, +12 STR/STA/AGI/DEX, +60 HP Effect Haste (40%+)<P>Wrist AC 10, WT 0.1, +10 STR/STA/AGI/DEX, +5 ALL SAVES Effect:Greater Lightstone<P>Feet  AC 16, WT 0.2, +10 STR/STA/AGI/DEX/CHA, +5 ALL SAVES  Effect: Firefeet (Level_0 perm. rate of travel increase by 10~12 [Level/5])<P>I know you're scoffing- but our AC would still be lower than Warriors/Pallys/SK's- and we'd still have no where near the hit-points, or self-healing capabilities of the tank classes... the boots would compensate monks who are pulling in indoor dungeons (and therefore cannot use SoW) somewhat- and make them desirable (tho not overly-so) in a group environment at the exclusion of no other class... Rogues still dish out the most damage, and have hide, evade, and a higher cap of sneak... Rangers can SoW, Wolf-Form, wear even better armor, and have a range of healing spells... etc. etc.<P>These are all good ideas and merit serious consideration- especially the Celestial Armor -which should be Dragon-level quests... I recommend a chrome silk, and/or chrome leather type graphic- though chrome banded would look distinct too (detractors will say that Monks shouldn't be running around in better-looking banded than *they* can wear &lt;pfeh&gt; )... we all look-alike, it seems- very unrewarding in the end-game levels.<P>That was enough for now...<P>'cerely,<BR>Ceum<BR>Tholuxe-Paells/The Nameless<P>"Help End SPAM -make a sandwich, or put the stuff on a cracker"<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

This may seem too easy but why not?<BR>1) range suffer cycle time just as caster does.<P>2) it only interupt when hit. so there is no gaurantee that it hit all the time. so therefore u can't exploit this using throwing skill to stun caster mobs.<P>3) Range weapon need to have proper range to work so when ya target are close u can not use throwing weapon and therefore relying on melee. therefore bring another facet on gaming.<P>I think using throwing weapon to stun caster type will balance between caster class and melee class. one of the bigest problem vs caster was that u need to run up to the caster to stun the target while caster type only need to either root and snare run off a distant and drop DD on their target. making it too easy for caster vs melee class. Why should melee class have to wait till they get the uber resist gears or wait till they are in a confine space to have a chance at the caster type class?<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Not only is black panther armor heavy, it's rare as hell and it's stats are not very good.  Even if it's weight were reduced, there would be no real incentive to use it since it is so difficult to attain (rare components and a very difficult tailoring check) and there are already very good items in game that have similar or better stats.  If black pantherskin is to be made a viable armor, it will need both a weight decrease and a boost to it's stats, or barring that just a stat boost.  Better for it to be heavy but worth the weight than to be light and still useless due to the number of other quality armor pieces that are easier to get.  Here's my gear, it's only OK for a monk of my level (56).  Compare it to the black pantherskin stuff.<P>Head: froglok crown<BR>Shoulders: drolvarg mantle/tattered mantle<BR>Chest: foreman's tunic<BR>Arms: azure sleeves<BR>Wrists: symbols of loyalty to vox<BR>Hands: Celestial Fists<BR>Waist: flowing black silk sash<BR>Legs: drakkel wolf hide leggings<BR>Feet: iksar hide boots<BR>Back: cloak of shadows<P>Those are just the slots that I could fill with black pantherskin armor, were I to go to the trouble of getting any of it.  Compare the weight _and_ the stats of my existing stuff to the black pantherskin.  Then take into account that I am unguilded, have never been in a strong raid guild, and that many monks around my level have far superior gear.  I think you'll see that the pantherskin really needs a boost to be anything other than a waste of data.<P>Master Arikel Callistrae<BR>Erollisi Marr Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I believe monks should be the premiere pullers in the game. It disappoints me when other classes pull simply because they have the highest level. In my mind if a monk is present in a group/raid everyone should automatically want him/her to be the puller. This is certainly the case before level 50 but not post 50.<P>How to address this?<P>Partially un-nerf Feign Death and demystify it please. Explain to the eq community exactly how/when it works as you recently did with hybrid exp. It is our premiere skill for pulling and should be skill capped at 252 not 200. "Falls to ground" basically means dead against a bunch of high level mobs. When it does work, please ensure mobs do not continue beating or casting on us.<P>Raise the actual skill cap on our defensive skills to 240-252, specifically block, dodge, riposte. A new defensive skill like parry would be nice when we have a weapon equipped.<BR>I want to waltz around hard-hitting mobs without the need for lots of ac and hps - that is what a monk is about.<P>Lower, not eliminate, the chance of monks being stunned by mobs please. This would really help on long pulls.<P>Finally how about an enhanced effect for the mend skill at say 175+ ? In much the same way bind wounds is more effective at higher skill levels, say a 30-33% health regain?<P>Isaburu Sensei<BR>57 monk of The Rathe<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Basically , when Kunark and Velious came out many issues with being a monk were created. I was no longer the dmg dealer i used to be when compared with other classes. Take a lev 35 monk with a knuckleduster and a fighting baton and a 35 warrior with the wurmslayer , both pretty twinked for level 35. I just could not compete with the warrior in any way , he had more AC , more dmg , more hitpoints , i got hit a little less , but he far outpaced me , then when we dueled...it was extremely sad from my point of view. Now , i am prepared for a change in roles however Verant sees fit , they may decide that monks are no longer the dmg dealers they used to be. but here are some suggestions. dont think i want them all , because doing all of them would make a monk waay too powerful.<P>An innate haste for all weapons , not just our fists.<BR>Parry skill added , and mainly a monk only dodgetype.<BR>no offhand damage penalty.<BR>make feign death a hit or miss , none of this i think i fienged....oh wait its still killing me.<BR>how bout a lightweight bag for putting money in to make it less weighty???<BR>Let the design team know that monk armor no matter the stats will not be worn unless it is LIGHT. whats the point in wearing something 10ac 2wt when the extra weight drops us 5 ac?<BR>give an Innate dmg raise for all weapons used by monks.<BR>I agree with some monks wanting to use hands only , but a weapon is an extension to improve what a hand cannot do , and making hands more powerful then weapons is something i dont agree with just because it dont work like that.<BR>In my mind a monk is supposed to be able to locate vulnerable areas moreso then a warriors , so how about crit strike on our skill attacks like flying kick?<BR>A stat increase based on level , make us gain a lil str , dex , agi , sta over time as we progress thru levs , personally i think all melee types should.<BR>Maybe give us the same magic resistance warriors get as they progress. <BR>this is all assuming that the role verants wants is a dmg dealer , if they have decided a new fate for monks , let us know what it is and then make us equal with other classes in the respect.<P>Also as it is now the epic quest for a iksar monk to complete is much harder then for a human , mainly because we are KOS to both freeport and qeynos where alot of this quest is supposed to be done. I know being KOS is something ive had to live with , and am currently trying to up faction in freeport , but the faction there is much harder to gain because so little gives guard faction. Either give us an alternate route to gain the Robe of lost circle and whistling fists through our own iksar quests , or give faciton to a much wider variety of creatures , I think the design team when adding Epic quests either did not realize the problems this causes or actually intended it. But personally i dont think that the iksar deserves over 100+ hours of faction gaining to even start the quests.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Armor Class<P>Monks do not need unreasonable AC upgrades on equipment.  Due to our innate weight restriction, it's easy to reach a very respectable level of AC that rivals Paladins/SK's, and beats several plate classes like clerics, & bards.<P>This is because of the large number of items that are monk usable, relatively low weight, and high AC.  (Tranix Crown, Azure sleeves, Symbol to Vox, etc)<P>The only piece of Shiverback I use are the gloves, and they will be replaced by the epic eventually.  Increasing shiverback, or some other "special monk armor" set to a level that rivals the equipment we're already using would be nice.  Requests for AC 18 legs, AC 15 arms, etc are out of line, and would give monks an unfairly high level of AC.<P>Damage output<P>My level of damage output is very good using a Jade Mace mainhand.  Once I obtain the celestial fists, I will deal signficant damage.  There are several very good 2H monk only weapons in the game.  The Celestial Fists are our ultimate 1H weapons are are very good.<P>Damage output seems to be a concern for a large number of high level monks.  Here are a couple suggestions:<BR>1)Have an off hand damage bonus, but much smaller than the main hand bonus.  1 pt every 2 levels past 50, so at L60, the minimum off hand hit would be 6 at Level 60.  This would be a significant damage boost at the high levels, and is perhaps even a bit too much, given the speed of the celestial fists.<BR>2)Flying kick minimum damage.  It's rather dissapointing to see a thunderous kick for 22. :)  Like rogue backstab is a minimum of 1 pt per level, I'd love to see flying kick the same, or a minimum of 1 pt for every 2 levels. (25 damage minimum at 50, 30 at L60)  Then I'd never see a Thunderous kick for less than my level.<P>Feign Death<P>FD is great.  What I'd like to see is some way to clear agro, other than /q ing out of the game.  Past posts have indicated that Verant doesn't feel /qing out is exploitive.  Why not give us a way to clear agro without having to /q?<P>Call of the Hero is mostly how this is done in raid situations, but a 55+ mage is not always available, or a smaller group may not have a mage.  The key is to enhance our ability, without detracting from the value a CoH enabled mage provides.<P>My suggestion would be to give us a combat ability, like FD, that instead clears our agro.  Put it on a very long timer, similar to Lay Hands, or Harm Touch.  This would save the monks out there the tediousness (and poor role playing) of quitting the game to make mobs forget about us. However, this would be slow enough that Mages would still be desired for their ability to clear a puller's agro without having them /q out.<P>This ability would also answer the request of monks that we be given a way to reduce agro on uber mob kills.  Ie: You can reset your agro to 0, but you cannot use the ability very often.  (Same timer as HT/LH)<P>FD Bug.  When you're a low HP's, and a mob is frenzied on you, it will see right through FD.  If this intentional, so be it.  If it's a bug, I'd love to see that one fixed.  <P>Additional Enhancements<P>Overall, the monk is a very good class that needs little enhancement.  Here are a few things I would like to see that are probably reasonable.<P>Stun ability.  Monks have no ability to interrupt casters, othan than hoping we hit them enough times.  I'd like to see one of our lower damage special attacks have a chance to interrupt casting.  Make it so that we choose to lower our damage output by not using flying kick, but as a result, get a chance to interrupt casting.<P>That's it :)  I'd like to thank whoever designed our epic.  The Celestial Fists are great.  The effect is so/so, but I love how the CF let us stop having to use weapons.  The monk is the master of unarmed combat.  I'll be happy when I can deal good damage without having to use weapons.  Thanks for the raise on the H2H cap as well.<P>Adun, 53 Ranger, Brell Serilis<BR>Adune, 54 Monk, Brell Serilis</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>High level monks depend on a party to play EQ, but what can they offer in trade for one of the six solts ? At the moment any party that is able to do more than camp a very poor place abolutely needs a cleric, who will only join a party if there is an enchater to give him clarity. The enchanter will only join a party that has a warrior to taunt the previously mezmerized mobs. Because of this simple needs half of the slots of any party are preoccupied by any class in 90% of all good parties. All the minor classes (not clerics, warriors and enchanters) now start a race to competet for the remaining 3 slots. Some classes have alternatives (mage, necro, druid) so they can solo if they do not get one of these spots, but otheres (and among them the monks) can not. Since slow spells and buffers for melee classes and debuffing the mobs are realy very needed its obvious that a shaman will have excellent chances to get slot 4 of the party. Only 2 slots left now. <BR>Not much left, considering how many classes still need a place in the party. What can monks offer for the party ? They can do melee damage very good  and they can pull single mobs. Both very good for a party till verant started to power up first the enchanters and then the rogues. Enchanters are the  most effective way for crowd control and rogues do more melee damage than monks without taunting the attacks from the warrior. Rogues also are needed to open doors and are better at corpse recovering than monks now (this also has been a domain of the monks in earlier days). So the rogue  clearly wins the race for slot 5 against the monk and the other melee classes. Last slot. The party has no groupe gater for evacuation still. So a wizard would be the best choice since he is a major damage dealer too. (A druid gets a fair chance on this slot too and has a litte chance to replace a missing shaman with Slow spaells, buffers etc.). Party full. And not only the monks are standing alone in the zone now ... looking for a party. They share this with paladins, SK and Rangers at least. Sure they can form a second class party now and get some xps and camp some not so damgerous spots, but felling second and not needed is not what anyone plays EQ for.<BR>This problem needs a general solution and perhaps getting the Paladins and SK a better taunt and druids and shamans to be better healers makes a step in the right direction, because there are more possibilities to substitute a call now (clearly warriors and cleric will not be to happy now). Mainly i want to porpose a solution for the monks here: They need to get special abilites that realy help a a party and do not invade the territory of another class. one solution could be to give the special attacks of monks a special meaning when a certain level is reached like being able to interrupt a spellcasting mob (NOT to taunt , since everyone wants a better taunt) or to push a mob backwards or to slow a mob for a few attacks  or to make a mob switch tagret randomly ... not all good solutions i am sure ... but just to give a indication of the direction. This would make playing a monk more fun since there is more to do and think than puch Flying kick and activate items  millions of times each day. To choose the right special attack at the right place against the right mobs would be a nice new challenge and get monks more to offer for a party. Many classes can disarm ... and its useless in not PvP ...but else this would be a excellent special attack for monks if the mobs are realy noticeable weaker when disarmed.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Monks AC and damage<BR>The natural AC of monks is a fair tradeoff for the waight penalty in lower and middle levels but in the high ones all tank classes get items with very high AC and the natural AC of monks does not realy increase. This widens a gap between classes that can tank a mob (Warriors, Paladins and SK) and those that just drain clerics mana (monks and rangers). On the other hand the superiority in dealing damage is not very important for a party at high levels. To the contrary: to not taunt a mob from the tank (who has the high AC) monks must reduce the damage they do. In this respect rogue are simply better since they do more damage and can evade the mob. So what will monks gain from a simple increase of their damage output? Verant mus be more inventive in regard of needs and not just give one class what a other class can do already. Only new abilites can solve competition problems. More damage, tripple damage are nice and good for monks but ALONE they are not worth much and giving the evade skill to monks would hurt the rogue like  the monks where hurt when the rogue invaded the monks slot in the party. More AC simply invades the territory of the three more or less heavy tanks. SOLUTION: give monks the ability to tank ONE oponent they are facing at least as good as a warrior can but keep the ability to tank more than one oponent as bad as it is by giving the monks a superior defense stratey that works like or even better than reposte against the facing opponent but not at all against all other attackers. This makes warriors still needed and does not bother the rogues. AND most of all ... monks can be what they should be: masters in fighting a opponent face to face by avoiding his blows and doing massive damage. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Epic quest and the need of a large guild.<BR>First: the epic quest is greate as it is.<BR>Nevertheless: i would be glad to get a chance to do the epic quest on another path too that does not need the battles involving 24 players at least. this makes getting the quest items indeed too easy for members of powerfull and large guilds and hardly unpossible for all others. Did verant realy intent to make the celestral fist a quest for becoming a member of a large guild? For other items this kind of social quest would be acceptable but not for the very unique monk item in the game. A alternative route to get them would be nice (i know it will not even get on the list ... what is a mistake and i dont want to make to mistake not to propose it ... hehe). This could involve about as much work as getting the robe of the whistling fist, perhaps even twice as much, but it should be possible to do it with one high level party. At the moment monks in large guilds get their epics in one evening and nearly without any problems and many other monks can not make a singe step towards gettign them.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Monks armor<BR>hmm ... do i now write a post about something that does not exist ???<BR>mist armor pieces a high level monk is wearing are  of a quality that even a middle class twink warrior would not use them and they are not class specific, just only monks wear them, because every other class that could wear it has much better items. SOLUTION: i understand verant does not want to make monk and warrior items just the same by giving both the stats that realy matter in game (high AC, many Hps) but then make more stats matter. Monks should be more happy with high AGI, STR and DEX items, worriors with AC, hps, STA and STR. BUT since AGI has nearly no effect compared to AC monks just search warrior items they can wear. Make AGI and DEX matter much more and introduce monk item sets that have high stats on these two. There is no sense in makeing a game with 14 classes, if some of them are just minor copies of the main class (warrior) with one or two additional features. By granting most melee classes most defense skills allowing them to reach a high kill level you leveled the differences between the classes and their needs for different items as well. <BR>And because noone has mentioned it before: the shiverback leggings and arms are realy a shame for monks and i would undterstand if a monks camps some weeks so he NOT has to use them. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I have a 49 monk and admittedly havnt been on any great post 50 raids, but... <P>Since we cannot carry weight and are poor most of our lives where are we suppose to get the money for this stuff. 20k or 30k for these weapons. Ya just go right out and buy one. Sure thing pal.<P>The first thing I bought was a Tink bag b4 any weapons so I could carry loot, I never saw more than 200 pp at once until after lvl 30. (I still have to dump my silver and copper). I finally got a FBSS, and 1 Wu's Stick, and now have under 500 pp's in the bank. I bet no other class is so poor that close to lvl 50. Also im still wearing the same crescent gear Ive had for the last 15 levels. The onyl reason I could afford a Tink bag, and my first Wu's Stick was I made some good (for me) cash of cougar claw earrings the first 2 weeks of velious. Otherwise id have nothing for weapons, fighting batons I guess.<P>I been in COM playing for 10 hours a day for a week and saw one Wu's Trance stick drop, and of course everyone wants to roll on it even though Im the only monk in the group. (I lose the roll, of course). I would like to see some of these weapons be no drop that way when a monk achieves the level to get them he can actually get one without spending 3 months camping for an item.<BR>I havnt completed my rotlc quest because Raster never spawns when im around. And its ridiculous how long it takes, this should be changed.<P>No wonder so many people play monks as twinks, because if he is your main like mine is you will be poor most of your char's existence. My only hope is to achieve even greater level and somehow get into a guild that will want me despite my lack of nice gear.
