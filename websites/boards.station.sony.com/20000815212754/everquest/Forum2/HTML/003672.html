</FONT><HR>Ok, I very rarely group with Rogues, and after my last experience I may never do it again.  I was in a group with a rogue and a couple others in HH on the gnoll ledge.  Now this rogue we were with was simply a lousy group member, kept pulling when everyone was resting, ran at the first sign of trouble, started screaming for heals when he got a bubble of health, and of course, looted any corpse he could get his right click off on.  You know the type, a group member that makes you want to solo for the rest of your EQ life.<P>Anyway, we were already having enough problems with this guy when he suddenly asks if anyone wanted the beer he just pickpocketed off a gnoll we had killed.  He then started bragging about how he was loaded with coins and needed to run to the bank to change em in for all the money he was getting.<P>Now I was looting a fair amount of corpses, and I kept getting cp off of most of the kills, I thought this was odd, but was too busy yelling at this moron for his other grouping "skills" that I didnt really think of it much.  But after he said this, I started paying more attention, and after about another half hour I was still getting junk from the corpses in terms of money.  Not that the gnolls in HH are rich mind you, but they generally have a gp every now and then.  I must have looted 25 corpses and never gotten more then a couple silver from them.  Which brings me to the problem, when rogues use thier pick pocketing skill does that take from the loot on the corpse?  It makes sense that it does, or they would be just making money out of the air, but if it does, then why would anyone EVER group with a rogue.  I personally probally never will again.  Sure the backstab on running critters is nice, and they can deal some damage, but not if they are stealling all the loot.  I dont need that, I already got enough problems buying my spells.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Yeah, and I hate casters that constantly roll for Ravenscale.  There's a lot of jerk casters that do that.  <P>Nyrulz, just because this particular person was a rogue, does not mean all rogues are like him.  In fact, rogues constitue the majority of the best players in the game...simply because of the adversity we've put up with.  <P>We can't solo, and therefore must group.  But because people like you portray us in a negative light (hell, your story could be complete fiction for all I know), we have a difficult time finding a group.  Most casters I know give up when the going gets rough anyway.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Pickpocket used to take from a separate pool of coins (I think that it always stole the occasional minor item, but I'm not sure).  The reason we know this is that a typical pickpocket from a gnoll pup, say, once your pickpocket skill was fairly high, would be 20 or 35 copper.  When was the last time you looted 35 copper?<P>Sometime last year, it was changed to take from the general loot pool.  This is generally regarded as a bad move.  People heard for so long that rogues sucked that they believe it now, and it is more difficult to get a group than it should be (I love playing a rogue, and I love grouping with a rogue when playing a shaman).  The pickpocket change only hurts things, for no apparent reason.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>A while back (took a break from EQ for about 3 months) the skill of Pickpocket took loot from a seperate pool off the MOB.  There was at that time speculation that this wasn't always the case, for some folks were hunting HGs and would note that several of them didn't have any plat on them.  At the time I wasn't high enough level to solo HGs to be able to say, so I put more faith in the statement by Verant that Rogue's didn't diminish party loot with the Pickpocketing skill.<P>I can now solo HGs, and I can tell you that sometimes their loot sucks, and no it isn't because there's a Rogue running around invis picking their pockets.  How do I know this?  I keep see Invis up for one thing, and for another I know where the HGs spawn and can keep them under eye from the time they spawn till the time they die (have to while medding and making sure they don't walk over me).  Anyway, sometimes the loot is just crap.  I can't say why this is, I haven't been able to pin down any sort of reliable variable on it.<P>Anyway, the point of the response is I sincerely doubt that Rogue's take away from party loot.  If they did, Verant would be making a colossol mistake.  I may not have a particularly high opinion of them, but the ramifications and fallout of such a decision would be more headache than it's worth for them, which is enough of a motivation for me to beleive them.<P>However, one fact is true.  Rogues are frequently rich to the point of absurdity by the time they hit in their 40's.  I have known many of them, and most of them don't give it a second thought of dropping 200+ plat to a newbie because they have literally 1000s in the bank.  Also, some of my online friends buy plat through ebay from Rogues.  Which I personally think is rather ironic and fitting  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  I personally don't care, and I'm not going to rush out and build a Rogue to generate coin.  The Rogue class has been otherwise hosed from day one, and are still hosed in regards to how Poison works.  If coin is their redeeming feature, then hey, more power to them and may they enjoy the fruits of their labors.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

All that, and much much more.  This guy was a jerk, and that was regardless.  The main point was if the money comes from the loot pool, cause quite frankly, if I dont know you very well, I have no intrest in someone who can take all the coin off of every critter you fight.  Sorry, I worked just as hard for that coin, and you get it all?

</FONT><HR>ronboson, Hey, I think the rogues should be able to pick pocket, and I have no problem with them being rich.  And most (I would have to hope) are not going to be a moron like this guy I was with.  (I have been with a few others, and not had anywhere near this much problem).  My only concern is if they are taking money from the same loot pool.  From that one experience I say it does, but that isnt a whole lot of testing, maybe the gnolls were just poor that day.  I would like to know if it does or not tho.  If it does, they should change it, I see no reason for everyone in a group to lose money when a rogue PPs.  Maybe they should add a text that says So-So pick pockets ogre for 33 gp!  Hey verant, what is the official ruling on this, same loot pool or seperate?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>1.  Most rogues don't pick pockets.  I'm sorry that you had a bad experience but you should not assume that this is the norm.  In fact, any good rogue knows that picking pockets is a very *bad* idea, because a rogue is completely group dependant so a good reputation means everything.<P>2.  If they pick pockets, they can never take the last coin of any type.  So if you are complaining that corpses didn't have any gold or platinum you're wasting your breath.  Even if the rogue picked pockets, he will ALWAYS leave at least one coin of each type that the gnoll had to start with.  So if you didn't get at least one gold, the gnoll didn't have any gold to start with.  If all you get is copper, then copper is all the gnoll had to start with.  From the sound of it, he probably had to run to the bank because he was loaded down with worthless copper coins.<P>3.  Cowardice and bad play happens with any class, I'm not sure why you brought up his running away.  I play a rogue always try to wait for the casters and anyone else with less health than me to clear out before I even start to flee.  You already knew he was a terrible player.  Jerks will be jerks, no matter what class.<P>And regarding your second post, nyrulz, about who you can trust.  Would you rather trust someone with your money or with your life?  A cleric who won't heal is much much worse than a stupid rogue picking pockets, so I don't know why you single out a bad apple specifically among rogues.  Think about it.<P>It's a shame that there are rogues like that fellow.  They mess things up for the rest of us.  I'm sorry you had to meet him.<P>P.S. lol about the ravenscale Torin.  I was just in Cazic Thule and a monk in the group starts asking where the ravenscale drops because he says he can sell it for good money.  This with me standing right there.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

What I mean is, if something has 3gp 5sp and 8cp, the most a rogue can steal is 2gp 4sp and 7cp, and they can only steal one kind at a time.  <P>When you loot the mob, if it only has cp's, then it only had copper pieces to begin with.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Dythe regularly comes out with more health than any other charicter in the party becuase of evade. I will make a dicision weather I want to taunt the mob off, or just kill it while it is on the other person.

He was a REALLY bad group member, and I wouldnt group with HIM ever again under any circumstances.  I was telling the rest of it to just point out what a bad group member HE was.  I wasnt saying all rogues would play that poorly.<P>2.  My main concern was with pick pocketing.  So the rule is that they can take all but one of every coin?  Well then I guess I wont group with rogues.  They really should add a line of text saying that they DID pick pocket if that is the case.  I will not group with a rogue as long as this is the case, sorry, I need some of that money too.<P>Now if you want to say what he did was very rogueish, and all, well that is all well and good.  But I cant group with someone who has the power to take all the loot off of every kill we get, just to rely on the good nature of that person not to hit the pick pocket command and get that much richer.<P>Is this really official tho?  Everyone seems to have a different opinion as to how PP actually works, anyone know for sure that it comes off the loot off the critter and that it cant take the last coin off of the loot?  If that is the case, then yes that guy was the last rogue I will group with, but they should add the text on it like normal loot, this way if a rogue really doesnt PP, then a group will KNOW this and will be able to group with the person.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I play a rogue as one of my characters, and I'll have it known that I NEVER pickpocket when grouped.  I reserve pickpocket for when I'm looking for a group, and for when people are KSing.  <P>For example, last night, in BB, there was this group of elves about lvl 8 with one high level guy.  They were powerleveling, and killstealing from everybody.  The high level guy just stood around casting root and every once in a while the occasional DD to finish off a fleeing kill.  So I got fed up with them and commenced pickpocketing every single monster they attacked.  I made quite a bit of money, but only because I did it for a long time. <P>Tell you the truth, my lvl 12 rogue almost never gets more than a silver per monster that he tries to pickpocket.  Even when attempting over and over and over til the monster dies.<P>I will admit that I have met a number of rogues who think that the class should be played as a complete jerk, taking everything they can, and running away at the first sign of trouble.  Most of us aren't like that.  Granted when people are KSing from me, or just generally being jerks, I can dish it back 10fold, either by pickpocketing their kills, or aggroing a monster or two, running their way, then ducking from combat.  <P>However, I think ninja looting is generally more of a problem caused by nonRogues.  We have to deal with such a bad reputation so often that only a dumb rogue, a newby, or just a jerk will actually give others a reason to not like us.  <P>So do us a favor, please don't go around making blanket statements that every rogue is like the one you had a problem with.  I sure don't hold all elves in contempt, even though most of the problems I have with conceited characters ivolve an elf.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>That's how it works nyrulz and most rogues never use it in groups.  I only use it occassionally as a taunt, after which I split anything I gain.  I believe I've saved peoples lives before using pick pocket, but I can't say for sure.  It's certainly your choice not to group with any rogues, but you are excluding the single most efficient damage dealing class in the game when you factor in downtime.  You're also going to have to turn down plenty of group invites when the group already has a rogue before you get there.  Keep in mind that the higher in level you get, the less you can expect this kind of behavior.  Rogues have a high drop out rate early on and I would suspect that bad rogues would be the first to quit.  Probably after level 20 or so you won't see many more of these types.  I wouldn't worry about it too much.<P>P.S.  IMO, if you want to meet jerky players, Highhold is definitely the place to do it.  I think it's one of the worst zones in the game for selfish players.  Get out of there as soon as you can and you'll be more happy with the people you meet.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>So if the pick pocketing really works like this, then they definitely should add a message saying so and so pickpocketed gnoll for 3 gp 4 sp.  Having 4 chars in the 20-30 range, and having grouped with about 4 or 5 rogues in all that time, I dont think it will be too hard to avoid them in groups.  However, Verant should definetly either change the looting system to work from a second pool, or give a message to the group when they PP.  This way if a rogue is doing it 3 or 4 times a kill, he can just be removed from the group, and we dont have to rely on the honesty of a thief.  With all the problems facing rogues getting groups, this seems like an obvious need.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I was like 'come on!'.  At the time I was hunting aviaks, which means, either your group is attacking that aviak or someone else is, there's nothing like 'idle aviaks'.

</FONT><HR>Thats tough too, if something pops, u pick pocket it, and someone else is camping it, that would be terribly annoying.  Maybe the only fair answer is that it should go back to the way it was, just make the PP loot come from a seperate pool, this way Rogues cant steal loot from others with no way to penalty.  But left as is, I would be happy if they just added the message.  I am used to KSers, and loot KSers would not be too big a problem for me, but if I am in a group I want to know I can trust the guy I am with.  I can see if someone is looting all the corpses, or runnin away from fights, but I cant ever know for sure if a Rogue is PPing.

I am not saying that rogues shouldnt be able to PP, but that there should be a message saying when they do.  This way if the guy is doing it and continues to do it, you know and can boot him from the group.  This way I can trust that rogue and he/she can get into more groups.

They will take a certain amount of coin each time they pick - only if they are successful (which at highpass levels isn't all that often) - until one coin of each type is left.  It is removed from the group loot pool.  Yes, if they are picking they are taking away from the group coin pool.  Most rogues don't pick pockets, and many that do inform the group and share their earnings.<P>If you don't want to trust a rogue, then you don't have to.  It's your choice.  I've made many friends myself and they all trust me implicitly.<P>The idea of having the loot message appear to the group has been suggested before.  Many rogues supported it and many didn't like it, mostly for roleplaying reasons.  Verant decided they did not want to make a change like that because "rogues are by design supposed to have certain issues of trust that they will have to deal with."

</FONT><HR>Okay.  Best wishes and I hope you eventually meet some good rogues who change your mind.  Maybe someone will drag your corpse out of a tight spot (with lots of critters that can see through invis but not hide/sneak) for you.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Most rogues are pretty cool.  The *really* cool ones will tell you they're practicing PP, then split their gain with everyone before they leave the group.  There are, though, some buttwipes who'll grab every last copper they can--but they're not restricted to Rogues.<P>Also, most mobs that can talk (orcs, dervs, guards, etc.) will say, "Argh, a Thief has stolen from me! &lt;roguenamehere&gt;" or something similar when a rogue has successfully pickpocketed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The "Stop Theif!" message doesn't always fire.  I think it's a critical PP failure that this happens.  I would usually see maybe 1 or 2 per hour of pick pocket training.<P>I did forget about PP being a good taunt.  I may have to re-map that to my primary or secondary hot-key group.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003672-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003672-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/003672-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=003672&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=003672&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
