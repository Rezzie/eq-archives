</FONT><HR>Nice post but you are completely wrong. If you didn't notice both Kunark and Velious have many options for casual gamers to get "uber" armor and weapons. So many in fact that many of the more powergaming types have complained or quit. Imagine spending hours and hours in Fear losing levels to get a full set of planes armor only to have better armor dropping at the zone in Karnor's Castle when Kunark opened. Same for many weapons in Kunark too. Then with Velious once again powergamers are complaining about how easy it is to get PoG armor or equivalent from quests when they spent a lot of time learning to kill Trak and Venril to get their legs and bps. There are many many other examples also of great equipment available in Velious with un-uber guilds from just killing things or quests. As for one group hunting, why have you not been through Kael and the Arena area with one group? Much of Velketor's Labyrinth is doable with one group. Much of Dragon Necropolis. Siren's Grotto, Icewell Keep, Skyshrine. Is that not almost every high level dungeon in Velious? All very doable with one group, and yes I speak from experience. You need to be 55+ and have a well balanced group and be prepared to die adventuring, but it's all doable, and like I said sorry, you are wrong. There are even dragons to kill with small groups, one in Velious is almost too easy to get dragon level loot with ONE group. What I'm not sorry about is that there are still things left for uber guilds to do, they'd have to change the name to DoneQuest if there wasn't.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I totally agree with the post.<BR>The problem is though that there is a design floor in the game. <BR>Everybody wants to do something new. If you do the same thing over and over you get bored.<P>Initally 50 was the highest level you could reach, then 60, where next ?<BR>Verant wants to keep its customer base so they keep moving the goal posts. They don't want to lose the inital player base, the majority which are 50+ so they expand the game to keep them interested longer. Instead of making the game interesting to start afresh. New quests, new storylines.<P>This is the problem. By making it more interesting for the 50+s they are making in harder for the new up and coming players to reach the new levels. They remove the tools so up and coming people have a harder time getting there, mana stones for example.<P>VI need to make EQ more fluid, coaxing players to start again. Designing items with a lifetime. So armour and items can be destroyed by old age and mobs, not horded for ever. Have mobs that can't be beat occassionaly totally wiping out raid parties. Not letting them know though :-)<P>I'm already looking for a new game to play.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I can NOT wait for the next MMORPG, and I only hope that I can pull the rest of my friends to it with me. SURELY they will address the inherent design flaws in EQ. No amount of added content will keep VI's player base when the next game comes out. The pooch is already screwed. But I guess they have already made their money.<P>&lt;god that was bitter!

</FONT><HR>I personally think that to make a game where inflation wont be too bad, they need to do one of two things (not both):<P>1) Make the inherent power/skill of a player or class NOT come from items at all. When a level 50 buys a suit of armor off the rack and a sword and shield off the rack, FEAR THEM. Beyond level 5-10, players shouldnt have problems picking up this kind of gear. Magic items would be limited to non-combat effects such as a light spell or a true north spell. That would make the game all about grouping, exploring, fighting, learning new skills, and mastering the game, but uber treasure wouldnt help your character become overly powerful.<P>2) If you are going to keep magic items in the game and keep it where a large percentage of the power or effectiveness for a player CAN come from items, then a different approach is needed. They need to set the scale of power that a player will EVER be able to reach, and never exceed that. Then, they need to provide redundant magic items with similar effects. In other words, set level-based damage caps, AC caps, stat caps, damage-over-time caps for different levels and enforce it in code behind the scenes. Make sure that 75% to 80% of those caps are gained inherently by the class, so that uber loot wouldnt help you.<P>Example for #2. Maybe you design a game where a warrior should never do more than 4 * his level in damage in a combat round. OK, so then make sure that his innate skills let him do a minimum of 3 * his level in damage. Then, the magic items he gets can add all they want in terms of damage, but at any time if they excceed the innate cap of 4* the level, the extra is lost. Then hide damage messages by making them non numeric. Then make sure that there is PLENTY of equipment to achieve the difference of 1 * his level to make up the extra damage, such that at any given level there might be any number and variety of items to make up this difference, so there was no uber equipment, but plenty of interesting equipment for your level to quest for.<P>Of course all this is moot as far as EQ is concerned.<P>AnimatedU</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Dear Brad:<P>I agree that this is a very important thread that sums up my concerns for the game.  I'm a casual gamer, and no, I don't expect the game to revolve around me.  However, I would like a greater opportunity to share the wealth.<P>I'm not in a uber guild.  I don't have any particular advantages.  I earned all my equipment except for one item that was a gift.  I really enjoy the game, for the most part and don't focus too much on what the uber players are doing.  <P>However, I see the end of the road.  In my 40's, I've come to accept the fact that I will never visit any of the uber spots.  There is little chance of my getting multiple groups together to complete my epic quest.  And yet, so much of the game revolves around great equipment.  I routinely see characters under level 10 whose equipment exceeds my own.  Uber players can twink other characters to the point that they will out-level less fortunate characters.  This leads to the same players or guilds dominating the servers with multiple uber characters.  Why should they include me in an event when one of their own can just play a better-equipped alt?<P>I started two new chars and twinked one to see if the equipment made any significant difference... it does.  My twink can outlevel the other alt by a significant margin.  And, since my primary is poor, my twink isn't twinked with uber gear... he wears bronze and similar.  But it beats cloth by a long shot.  Having a silvery war axe instead of a newbie item makes a big difference.  And no one would call the axe "uber".  <P>My gameplay doesn't revolve around equipment, but.. life is MUCH easier when you have it.  And most of us will never wear the uber gear.  What I miss most is that I'll never enjoy the fun of experiencing some great zones.<P>I think that creating more mid-level quests would help.  I'd like to see more of them, and they should grant some decent items AND xp for the time and trouble.  This would make the game more interesting for folks like me.  Right now, if I want to quest, I forgo experience and there really doesn't seem to be many good items available from questing.  I don't level as fast.  My friends out-level me and we stop playing together.  Why is this?  If I spend 6 hours on a quest instead of fighting, I'm half a level behind... this doesn't seem right to me.  Sure, I got the ITEM I set out to get, but... the other players had 6 hours to loot ITEMS.  And they got the xp to boot.<P>I'm not asking that you take the power of the uber guilds away, Brad.  I agree that the horse seems to have left the barn on that issue.  I do ask that you create opportunities for those of us who can't put together raids and don't have the best gear.  Put in some decent quests (lots of them) that will allow us to have fun, level and obtain equipment.  The items don't have to be the best in the game, but they should be respectable.  Make steps in the quests doable solo or with a single group.<P>All of these ideas have been suggested at one time or the other by players who are more informed and more eloquent that I.  I'm sure you've read their posts.  Please read them over again and give this issue some serious thought.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>And there won't be a Blue comment - to even acknowledge this thread would be VI saying "Yes, everything is fubar for the bulk of the player base"  this would mean they were then forced with giving the game a massive facelift - something they won't or can't do.<P>Instead it's much easier for them to sit back and say "We've got lots of subscribers - everything must be fine... but we'll tweak the classes a bit to make people happy"<P>Of all the threads that follow this line VI has yet to respond to one in the months I've been playing and I wouldnt' expect them to start now.  Even on the off chance they DO realize there's a problem I doubt they find it in their economic best interest to re-vamp a 2 year old game when they expect their player base to roll over to SWG in the near future.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My main just made 29. The longest I have ever been able to play in one sitting is just under 3 hours.<BR>And that has been twice in the year that I have been playing. In one year my main has 16 days and 17 hours played and my other 4 characters time play would add up to less than 1 day. I cannot do a long camp for an item because of RL concerns.<P>At level 29 I am seeing how important the proper gear is. Much of which I have litle chance of getting. If the game was designed around a 6 person group then every encounter should be doable by a 6 person group. I would like to see zones geared toward set level ranges (like 15-25, 20-30, 30-40, etc.) that could only be entered if a character was in that range. These zones would drop good loot usable for those levels but could not be farmed by higher levels. Or have mobs have a switch that says they cannot be looted/harmed by someone X levels above the mob. All mobs wouldn't need this. Just those dropping loot designed for certain levels. Or make so a higher level would loose exp if the harmed/looted these mobs (and make it a noticable lose(YOU HAVE ANGERED THE GODS AND THEY DECIDE TO PUNISH YOU!)). So much of what I loot from an even con mob is of little use to me but would have been good 5-10 levels ago.<P>If the ubers want a real challenge, give them zones where they cannot group and guild chat, ooc, and shout do not work.<P>I do agree that al the new content seems to be for the 45+ people. I was looking forward to Velious to explore but gave up when I heard it would be only for 35+ and so did not buy it.<P>I also dislike throwing high level, high agro mobs in low to mid level zones and was glad I did not log on this past Holloween because my char was in the Lake of Ill Omen and would have most likely been one of the slaughtered ones, ruining my chance to have fun playing that evening. If something was going to be thrown in that zone on that day it should have been something/s that would be doable by the level range of chars in the zone. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Dwarven Grape here.......<P>I will admit, this was a great post.  I only read 3/4 of the thread so far but I just had to respond.<P>First off, I am a member of an "ubber guild" on Cazic Thule server.  However, I have friends that started after me that I feel sorry for them cause they are not in the top 5% of the game.  I think it is bad that I am walking around in some of the best items in the game at level 55 and some level 58 players are in less than full plane armor and will most likely never have any rare items.<P>I can understand why VI started making the ubber mobs for the ubber guilds.  They were trying to please their "hardcore" customers, the people that have been playing day in and day out since day one.  A +50 character is less likely to just up and stop playing because of the time he/she has in a character.  However, there is NOTHING that VI can do to stop ubber guilds from killing "X" mob.  We will find a way!  They tried area effect spells, life tapping, nearly 100%magic resistance mobs, mobs that quad for 1000hps, mobs with 750,000 hps and each and everytime we have come up with some tactic or strategy to beat the mob.<P>VI just wont stop though, they keep trying to make that "unkillable" mob so that 95% rest of the<BR>server does not have a chance.  Could anyone really see a non-ubber guild killing Dain in VoS?Not a chance in hell.  We have killed him numerious time but even then it takes an alliance of three ubber guilds and 100 deaths to do it. Sure we have plenty of people in just our guild to do it but getting the all together at the same time is a pain.  The people who want a life dont have a chance.  Even as a member of an ubber guild chances of a Trak BP is low much less that person of the non-ubber guild.<P>When VoS was released, I knew that it was going to be for the top 5% of the servers. Personally, I think the SoV box should have had a warning of "buy this expansion if you are ubber". I knew VI was going to raise the hurdle.  VI makes better mobs and those mobs have to drop better equipment.  Why go get that 10/17 weapon off a major mob if you can camp it in Unrest type of thinking.  What happens?  You get better weapons, armor for the ubber people.  After we all have that stuff, the mob we got it off of is often too easy to kill and VI makes the next "unkillable" mobs and we move on to it.   It is a never ending cycle that just gets increasing worse.<P>The raising of the bar is the reason for the Donals BP nerf, not any unbalancing problems. Simply, we killed some of their unkillable mobs before they wanted them dead, so how do you fix that?  You have a mob that an item was designed for and then take away the item.  VI mentioned that they would have to retune those mobs meant for the Donals BP.  Later VI comes along and states that the nerf would go in and THEN they would THINK about retuning those mobs. The Donals BP affected maybe 50 ppl on a server and it somehow became a big issue with VI.  50 out of 3,000 is NOT a big issue.  They made the statement that it would become increasing common. Yeah right.  One dropps maybe once every two months.  For them to become "common" it would take<BR>numerious years.  There are only like 4 on our server and Trak falls every 3 days and patches like clock work.<P>The newer people on the server have it easier in some ways and harder in others.  When I started (day one) I remember thinking how much one plt was.  Getting 5 plt was rare to go buy that leather armor piece.  Bronze was ubber and Rubi rmor made you a god.   At Level 55, I hand out more plt and armor pieces to newbies than I saw in my 30's.  I have even given away forest loops as a donation for Spirit of Wolf for kicks. Newbies today take armor and weapons we were using at Level 45 to kill stuff in Butcher Block and Unrest.  You can easily get items in East Commons that I was wearing in my 40s for the plt I give away for a buff.  People now look down at that yak they paid about 1K for and then looks at that warrior with an epic in his hand and wants one.  Of course we all do but because of how VI has the game set up you have to play 100+ days to get the level, then you still have a 1 in 1000 shot of getting it.<P>On the bad end the newer people have to deal with the fact that they may never see a good portion of the game.  They can dream and say they will, but chances are they wont.  And that is the sad part of EQ.  I will tell everyone reading this post that if you are not level +55 and part of an<BR>ubber guild you can give up on seeing anything past Cobalt Scars in SoV and give up on hoping for that Deepwater BP or Epic Weapon.  VI will come along and say it is possible "oh anything is possible" but it is just more crap.  VI has raised the bar so high that the ubber guilds are getting kicked around with 60+ people all who are level 55+.  There is no way that an average player even has a chance anymore.  VI has pushed you all aside because they think that the -50 areas and mobs are fine the way they are because they worked for us way back when.<P>This game is all about time.  That is what they want you to do is spend time in their game and keep giving them your $10.00.  The hardcore gamers ZOOMED through the first 50 levels and got bored and started leaving within a year of the release.  Why do you think it takes 8-10 HOURS of straight and hard camping to get 1/4 of exp post level 51?  The levels are so slow that they had to give us a second level bar (the blue one). You could spend hours playing and never even see the orange exp bar move.   VI made us level another 50 levels  of time while actually going up 10 level.  Only adding 10 levels instead of an additional 50 means they could get away with giving us less game content (spells, quest, etc.).  Would you be mad if you could reach level<BR>100 in the game and only ahve gotten 20 more spells between level 50 and 100?<P>I will say if you want to be ubber you can, if you put the TIME into it. VI has ignored the casual gamer.  Most ubber guilds will only let so many people in to their guild and the few that make it are usually the best up and coming players.  Leaving the rest of the server out in the cold. VIs only thought, that time is their money and they are going to milk you for all you are worth.<P>Finally, I believe that VI has some of the best public relation guys working for them.  If they did not have the best, would we take as much bull from VI as we have before quitting? Doubt it.  We know the truth behind the "risk v. rewards" crap, the losing tons exp at death crap, all the nerfing, and why clerics are so boring to play. Each of those mean death and loss of exp and more importantly TIME.  So we sit back camp their game and eat the garbage that they toss us, and we like it.  I know, I am right at the dinner table just like you taking the garbage they shove in by the mouth full.  They threaten to bann or suspend us if we speak out strongly about a problem in their perfect world they THINK they have created.  They hope if they keep the masses quiet they can get just a little more milk from us before the cow dries up.  VI knows that EQ is going to die soon, but the expansion of SoV will give them just enough time to milk us for $10.00 before the next MMORPG hits the shelves.<P>All this means, the casual gamer is screwed. You can tell by their responses to this thread. All  casual gamers say thanks to VI and remember to send them your monthly payment!<P>Of course that is my opinion, I could be wrong!<P>Darrak,<BR>Dwarven Grape<BR>Cohort<BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree with TravST about his comments on twinking. I've only been playing EQ for a couple of months and the thing that sickens me the most is the number of low level PCs running around with high level gear. Why should a Teens or Twenty-something PC be able to own and use say a SSoY which drops off a L45+ mob or a Wurmslayer which is a 40+ quest? There are hundreds of other pieces of equipment that could be used to demonstrate this point as well.<P>This is what is unbalancing the game and keeps unjustiviably raising the benchmark for the lower level players needing to aspire to. Doesn't something seem wrong when all sub-40 PCs basically have nothing to look forward to equipment-wise until they are at least 40+?<P>I can only surmise that when EQ was released, the initial starting players had something to feel excited about and they actually gathered equipment that was appropriate for their level. Every kill of a newly faced mob brought a sense of excitement and mystery of what new and improved object it might drop? Nowadays it seems there is nothing exciting to look forward to until you've spent a few months leveling up to at least 40+ (more like 45+ maybe) and then when you do get there it looks like the problem hasn't gone away.<P>Perhaps you can call it equipment envy but I think it is more of a game balancing issue, this is the root of all evil that has tarnished every facit of the game that has made once appropraitely hard encounters easier to accomplish.<P>Taking any of the Baldurs Gate games as examples, when you start one of these titles with a fresh party and no importing of equipment from a earlier party, you progress through the game and obtain equipment based on your level appropriatly, the encounters get harder but your also gathering equipment for your party to keep up with these challenges. Now if you restart Baldurs Gate and import your main character that you used to finish the game with all his equipment he gathered still on him, everything is easy with no challenges what so ever for your party. This same example could quite easily be used with EQ instead.<P>What has ruined the game in my eyes is twinking and player greed, something VI should of headed off in the early days of EQ. To make the game continually challenging and rewarding for a rising player is their ability to obtain and gather their own equipment from their own efforts. Every piece of equipment in the game should of had a minimum level of use characteristic that was set by the minimum level of the mob it dropped off. Any PC that was not at the appropriate level or higher, did not have the required skill to use this item. I would even go so far as to make most items in the game [No Drop] as well to stop people from hoarding these items until their friend/alternate PC got to the appropriate level to give to them.<P>By instigating a feature like this, the nature of the game would've remained constant and rewarding for every player no matter what his level, farming would be non-existant and the game would remain balanced for everyone.<P>But it is too late to introduce such a radical change into EQ so the only hope we have is that the next EQ-like game to be released has something similar setup to stop the same degradation in gameplay like what has happened in EQ.<P>Kullnan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wow lets get a response to this post. This has got to be the very best post ive ever read. I am very unhappy with velious it has no real PUG zones for the 50+ players what a let down. Dragon Necropolis could have been but its just to hard to get to and im not positive it could have supported more than 4 PUGs (ive only been here twice for about 12 total hours).  My responce to velious... I started my third charater and bought him up in kunark though LoIO,FM,OT,and now DL. maybe this is what they wanted from me to play longer but not put a strain on the high end zones and let those in Uber guilds have free reign in them while i was bored to death by but very addicted to EQ.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Apparently FoH (I'm guessing) went in and cleaned up in there pretty good. <P>2 hours after being open they shut Fear down.<P>They killed CT and from what I understand it was changed promptly to be a very difficult zone.<P>(Correct me if I'm wrong Furor or Brad.)<P>Now what concerns me, is when my guild is raid level, we have to sit on a calender system to fight over what little loot drops in the planes.<P>So again, if you were 50 first you would have experienced the Planes with no competition or line ups.<P><BR>Anyways, i'm straying a bit here, but recently I've seen a lot of my guildmates quititng their primary characters and making new chars just so they can be VIABLE for groups at higher levels.<P><BR>(Three classes and you get three guesses what they are.)<P>For the mudflation, as was pointed out, put level restrictions on items. <P>(This is not hard and I'm sure some LPC speaking propellerhead can do it in a few minutes while eating lunch.)<P><BR>Would love to see Furor Planesdefiler jump into this thread (I am sure Brad has a filter for this guy and reads immediately  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> )<P>And yes even if we have to admit that EQ is a money making venture let's not beat around the bush shall we?<P>Kudos Bogmog, you are the person with the finger on the pulse of EQ Players.<P>And to the level 19 fella, <P>I COMNDEMN YOU TO ORC HIGHWAY IN OASIS FOREVER!<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>(Couldn't resist)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Late getting to this but that was truely great post. I think Verant is taking steps to correct somethings so maybe they will respond to this post. They have pioneered a truely great game. However they seem to have lost touch with what the average gamer wants to do. <P>They simply will not address the sharing of exp with groups so it leaves us wanting to do things with a single group. Velious had a huge chance to address this but instead they dropped the ball. I know soo many people that dont even bother with Velious now. A shame really because you can easily see the potential.<P>I think you still need epic encounters, and having more scattered throughout the game is not a bad thing. However making zones so hard they are no fun just leaves me shaking my head.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I couldnt bring myself to read all of this.<P>You say that these encounters were made harder for the elite guilds who have farmed them.<P>Well you are partially right.But ill tell ya this you would have to kill and kill and kill and kill those dragons for a long time to get any amount of equipment that would cover any small amount of a powerul guild.Thinnk about it those dragons didnt spawn everday they spawned once a week and vox was always whacked out in power in comparison to negalfen and she was rarely farmed on a regular basis.<P>Those of you that just now have the ability to do dragons having things available to you that those of us would have only dreamed of .these things being readily available equipment that is leagues above what we had available to us at the time of our early dragon days.You have the ability to be up to level 52 which we did not.<BR>Just think about this ,I have screenshots of our early dragon slayings and many people were in bronze and banded weilding weapons that are now not even worthy of giving to a pet.<BR>You can say whatever you want about uber guilds and how they ruined it for the rest but think about what you have compared to what they had at those levels.Because i am in what may be considered an uber guild and at level 40 ya wanna know what i was wearing?bronze and banded.at 52? Ro armor. now at 55+ i am much better equipped but face it guys, if we have done anything we have provided you with the means to have better more accessible cheaply acquired equipment that should give you the ability to kill those dragons faster and easier than verant had ever considered possible at the time we were killing them.The dragons shouldnt be easier they should at the very least stay at there current abilities if not made harder considering the amount of great gear available out there.Nothing should be made easier for the casual player because some things in this game are just not casual encounters and they shouldnt be not everyoen should have the opportunity to have every god dragon in the game.<P>So if you want all that a game can offer to you and you want to be better than the mere mortals go play final fantasy.Oooorrr get off your hump organize a few raids on those dragons and get that equipment you cant obtain.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bump, this post was right on the mark.<P>CC-Conanan<BR>Those dragons back in those days were not as powerful as they are today. Since bronze, banded and fine steel was sort of "uber" back then, VI tuned the dragons knowing that people would be fighting with those kind of equipment.<P>The problem was, when people started killing nagafen and vox more and more, it became routine and pretty simple and people just get better and better gear (ie Cloak of flames). So VI started buffing up the dragons to challenge those elite players without thinking about the casual players who are still in bronze and banded. But that wasn't enough. The elite player kept Pummeling the dragons to a bloody pulp and VI just kept buffing them up more and more. Because of that the casual gamers in bronze ended up fighting dragons that was meant to challenge the elite players decked out in the best gears. Later on, with the kunark expansion, people were able to exceed past level 50 and on to 60, and onces again those dragons had to be beefed up more to compromise.<P>This cycle went on for a while till someone at VI finaly came up with a good idea. They let the dragons be able to pick who they fight. That means that people beyond level 53 (I think) could not fight nagafen or vox. I think that idea went a long way to help reduce the mudflation problem.<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
