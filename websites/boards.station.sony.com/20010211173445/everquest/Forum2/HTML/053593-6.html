</FONT><HR>I believe there should be either a questable robe for lower level monks (around 20 or so) or the existing three linear quests (Robe of the Lost Circle &gt; Robe of the Whistling Fist &gt; Celestial Fists) should be spread out over the levels instead of completing the first at close to level 50 (if you quest for all components yourself that is). For example, put the Robe of the Lost Circle quest completable in the 20s, the Robe of the Whistling Fist in the late 30s or early 40s, and keep the Celestial Fists quest where it is.<P>Kamyen Kadaver<BR>&lt;Coalition of Fists&gt;<BR>40th Monk, Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>the only real problem i have with my 53 monk is the disciplines.  we are supposed to be martial arts masters with increased physical abilitys.  so why is a "thunderous kick" only doing 23,24,29,83 i mean c'mon we are by then masters of flying kick(or should be) and already hitting over 80 most of the time with kick.  this is supposed to be a "discipline" something trained to a great extent be nothing less than a master at it.  thunder kick should be min dmg as the max of normal flying kick and extend its dmg range over the 200 area easily to be considered a mastered skill.  also whats with stone stance, we get a 12 sec 1/3 dmg reduction but the warriors is like a full minute and a nice reduction plus fighting skill minuses...monks being defensive masters should have a increased time for such disciplines as voiddance and stonestance becuase we ARE monks not meat sheilds WE do the evading and dodging head on.. plus we need something to get us to use the crappy strike/kicks before flying kick to get them maxed for use in later disciplines.  who wants to spend time at lvl 56-60 tail raking or dragon punching for almost nil damage we should get a specific atribute to each and unchain the timers letting us use both strike and kick that way we would be more inclined to train them beyond then skill we reach as we gain the mext upgraded attack until flying kick..<BR>thank you</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What we NEED is more bind wound ability always. It is so annoying to solo with the long downtime soon to come, since humans dont have iksars regen.. It'd be nice to be able to do 90-100% bind wound. This would lower down-time and not hurt balancing in the least..

</FONT><HR>A good skill you might add would be an active defense.. instead of the passive skills already in game. I'm not sure how you'd code that or if ya could but it would basically act like dodge, but you'd move around with the ctrl key+ arrows. This'd probably cause too much lag, but maybe it'd be some help.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I'm 57, with 3 weightless bags, and I can't carry more than 160 bandages, which don't last more than a couple dozen fights if soloing.<P>Doing it that way, you'd waste more time running back to cabalis to buy bandages than you'd ever waste just sitting and waiting for it to come back naturally.<P>Also, I generally save mend for the fights themselves, because the fastest way to solo is to pick mobs close to your own level.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, don't listen to the people whining about the epic being too easy because of the robes being available on Qwinn/Zephyl. (Yes, the monk epic is a little too easy, but that has nothing to do with it.)<P>The robe is on Zephyl apparently as a way for high level monks to get it. The quests to get the robe are for very very low level monks, easy spawns in easy areas of lower guk and nagafen's lair, with the sash and headband quests being equally easy to get. They are however, time consuming to get.<P>Zephyl is a MUCH harder mob to take down than most others. He's an ubermob, would eat Vox and Nagafen for lunch...at the same time. He's intentionally this way to provide an alternate method of getting the robe for high level monks, other than doing a very long, very easy, very low level, drawn out quest.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Not sure if this will get read..<P>I know giving us new "looks" to our armor would be asking way to much, but I have to ask...<P>Our planes armor looks like cured silk. Why? heck why does all our armor look like cured silk? A level 50 monk in full shiverback (never happen, not very good armor) looks like a level 5 monk in full cured silk. A level 50 warrior in full planes gear looks AWSOME! They look nothing like they did at level 5, 10, 20, 30, or 40. they look like they have accompished something...we look like we paid 100pp or less for our armor. How depressing. Even our new Silver moon armor from POG looks like cured silk....whats with that? Our 20's armor (Crescent, wich we cant get till our 30's)..looks like cured silk. i know we have armor that doesnt look like cured silk. Problem is its not worth using. I just want to see monk upto par with all other classes as far as looking like we've done something. Druid's and monk get the short end of the fashion stick.<P>On the linking our special attacks posts...I would love to see this happen but I am not sure on how it could be balanced.<P>One last thing..<BR>I would like to see ALL monk only items become no drop quest items obtainable at the correct levels. Make all items to do the quest no drop. I think it would be cool. Make monk EARN what they get. Like monks should.<P>Thas all</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>/rant on<P>this revamp of the classes is a total load, all it is is to keep people from quitting and going to the other mmorpg's , they really dont have a problem telling necromancers to screw off because maybe 5% of server high level population is consisted of necros, same with shadowknights, they already know that lots of low levels will leave to other MMORPG's so they arent trying to *fix* them.  lets just put it this way, they are worrying about necromancers being able to even do a single *seriously* point of damage on raids without there pets but monks can literally QUAD for 30 every second with there epic which is 990502848902x easier to do then the necro epic which is a piece of snot. your like *heh* so what i bet, but lets just do a *little* math here, celestial fists are nearly 10 delay with cf effect and a regular old fbss = 1 second approx, and basically you never dont double attack or duel wield at 60, but you have about a 70% chance to hit*just a guess*.  Ok necros MOST DAMAGING DOT IN THE GAME / per tick happens to be envenomed bolt i believe, which u get at 51 or 52.  anyway in 6 seconds it does 110 damage, now i present to you how much damage can a monk do in 6 seconds, lets find out 4x .7 x 30 x 6 = 504 damage in the time it takes to do 1 tick, thats probably a bit high , but the minimum number is probably, around 360 average per 6 seconds ...  now you look at a necro and say gee 110 dmg for 10 ticks (1100) for like 400 mana, or 60 damage for 60 rounds which is um 3600 damage in a minute, not counting kicks, and what does the monk take in return? not a damn thing.  at level 60 a necromancer would have to cast:<BR>-prycuror: 999dmg in 1 minute, 1899 in 2 for 400m<P>-cessation of cor 1000dmg in a minute for 250m <P>-splurt for about 800 dmg due to progressive nature for 237 mana, it does 1600 total. <P>thats equal damage right there approx hmm how much of a necros mana pool at 60 is that? <BR>200 int with base of 134 is approx 2600 mana, and the total cost of those spells is *about 900 mana*<BR>which is ABOUT 35% of there mana pool, my take on it REDICULOUS.  oh also it takes TIME to cast the spells, about 12 secs to pull off all 3 of them in a row, so thats umm 2 less ticks of damage on all of those spells? and THIS IS NOT COUNTING JUMP KICKS, **houston we have a problem**<P>TO TOP IT OFF, THEY HAVE TAKEN AWAY OUR LIFETAP UNRESISTABILITY FOR RAIDS (they did this for all bosses) BUT THEY GIVE WIZARDS *oh boy* LURES WHICH UMM, ARE BASICALLY UNRESISTABLE<P>/rant off<P>all this info is taken off eq.castersrealm.com btw</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Please listen to these ideas......<P>Ok here is a couple of ideas that I think would not only fix the monk class... but make it superb fun to play a monk whilst also not overpowering them.<P>1. Improve FD (Post 50)_________________________<P>If a monk stays FD for one second .. the monk is wiped from the hate list of mob they have targetted.<P>This will help monks in uber encounters and to not have to /q when a move keeps remembering them when they are travelling. It will NOT make pulling easier in places like Velious and the Hole.<P><BR>2. Give monks the Ability to use their specials at the same time ___________<P>BUT when they do a special whilst another is greyed they use MANA (chi energy).<P>This mana's regain may or may not be sped up by clarity or meditate (could use the mend skill for meditate). Monks meditating isn't really a strange thing is it?<P>A monk could if they need to..exhaust their mana supply in a flurry of attacks.. this would give them tons of strategy in encounters and give them a reason to train EVERY special move.<P>The mend ability can be extended to 250 skill...and mending can instantly regain (mend skill-100)/3 % of the monks mana. Thus a monk can chose to save mend for a healing top up and saftey barrier (when they are already at high hps) OR (spend it every time it pops up to keep their chi energy flowing (but perhaps not gain as many hps per mend as they would since they are already on high hps when they use it).<P><BR>I.E. Mend gives 25% of the monks hps + 0-50% of their chi energy on each use.<P><BR>____________________________________________<P><BR>Every monk would benefit from these changes.<P>Their agro would no longer be a problem.<P>They would move more towards a rogues damage but not vastly nearer.. but still be cool and have a reason to train every skill.<P>They would have more chance to interrupt casters as more specials mean an innate interupt chance (due to the hit) which is still not near stun or bash attacks in terms of effectiveness.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The very first post on this thread I have to slightly disagree with.  Yea Iksar have a ton more stat and race bonus' than humans.  But one thing balances it ALL out.  Faction Faction Faction.  Sure faction can be changed but think how time consuming that is. Think about how you can only hold 15 weight being a Monk and having access to only the bank in Cabilis. <P>I do agree about the FD thing.  Really needs to go to where you FD'ed so your officially dead and off hate list. Its rediculous when...lets say Sarge slate in EC aggros you and you FD.  and hes all the way on the other side of EC when you get back up and hes already on his way back to beat on you seconds later.  That just defeats the whole purpose of FD.<P>I also think monks armor and damage should be upped alot. I mean our best armor (Shiverback) practically has the same ac as leather with just tons of stat bonuses, while Warriors are getting 22ac gloves and 40+ac BPs.  Even rogues and rangers are getting extremely high dmg weapons and gear while monks are still stuck with the same 14/26 (lvl 60 monk human hands) and same leather AC armor. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Make stats for monks more effective for their skills.<BR>I have seen all kinds of "ideas" on how to improve/balance monks in this thread. Some are simple, some difficult, some outlandish, and some well thought out.<BR>To be very simplified nearly all of these balance "issues" could be addressed by changing how the primary stats of a monk affect their skills.<P>Want to increase damage?<BR>Do it with how DEX/STR affect the hit/miss percentage and/or the way STR affects damage. <P>Want to decrease the damage taken?<BR>Do it with the way AGI affects defensive skills.<P>Want to put in minimum damage?<BR>Do it based on STR or DEX or a combination of the two.<P>Want to increase HP's? <BR>Do it with the way STA affects HP's.<P>Want to increase AC?<BR>Do it with the way AGI affects AC.<P>Want to make ID or FD more effective?<BR>Do it with the way stats effect these skills.<P>To me this is much more in-line with peoples ideas of a monk (although I am unsure about VI's "Vision" of a monk. To me changing the way STR, DEX, AGI, STA affect a monks performance provides many more avenues for the player and could make the monk more in-line with the way people view monks. Monks in nearly all viewpoints strive for physical and/or mental "perfection". Why not let our stats let us accomplish this instead of the weapon with the highest dam/sec or the gear with the best AC?<BR>Monk could actually choose to be a defensive or offensive depending on what stats they strived to increase.<BR>In any case the way it stands monks are not "monks" we are simple fighters that are harder to keep alive. When you ask what should a warrior to increase to be more effective most reply with "AC and STR". To me it is very sad that when the same question is put to monks their response is "Same as a warrior". /sigh<P>You can "fix" (balance) nearly every issue raised on this thread by changing the way the stats affect a monk. Since monks are suppose to be "pure physical specimens" does it not fit right into that "Vision"?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi, I'd mainly like to see more decent quest items for the monk. I'm mainly talking about the sash quests the stats on them really arn't very good and a FBSS is better and so is an EXE hood. So I really wonder why the stats on those sashes are sooo bad? It takes soooo long to do them and you can but an exe hood for like 100pp which is far better.<BR>I would prefer sashes that give some decent stats to the monk. You could included new sashes at the guild similar to the ones in Real life Kung Fu.<BR>You can have Red with tassles, and Black with Tassles and Gold, and Gold with Tassles. Its only a phone call to a Kung Fu accademy to check how the sash system works in Kung Fu (hung gar - shaolin).<BR>Any way over all im quite happy with the monk, the weigh restricion is a bit harsh but I understand it comes with the territory.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok this thing is getting very lenghty, i just wanted to present the points that need to be resolved in one single post.  These are not necesarily my opinions.  Here it goes:<P>*Monks need to be doing more damage, someway or another, BUT not from new weapons that are hard to get.  The solution must affect the class as a whole.  Most popular idea seems to be an enhancement to the dmg/delay of the fists themselves.<BR>*Feign death needs to be enhanced.<BR>*Items, especially the monk quest items (i.e. CF's, sashs,) need to be revisited.<BR>*the disciplines need to be revisited, because, as is, many are pointless<BR>*The monk as a class is too powerless against caster mobs.  Monks either need the ability to stun or feign through casts.<BR>*The look of monks needs to be more varied. (very aesthetic in my opinion, it would be nice, but falls near the end of the list of necessary changes)<BR>*These points need to be addressed in a manner that will not turn monks into one of the other classes, monks need to remain a distinct class.<P>If I missed something plz mention it.  If you think this pretty well sums up what we need, i think we should start a seperate Topic to discuss HOW we should go about JUST these things.<P>Vodalus Corpze<BR>Monk of Tallon Zek<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR> A couple things I think all the melee classes should dish out the same amount of damage based on how many hit points each class has. A warrior for instance would do less damage per round but because they have more hit points and can last longer would end up doing the same amount of damage as the other two melee classes. A monk or rogue would do the same amount of damage as the warrior does, but because they have fewer hit points would do more damage per round. As for this idea that one class should do more damage than another is rediculous I don't accept that rogues should do the most damage or warriors should do the least and monks should be somewhere in the middle we should all be the same over the life of our hit point reserve that would be the fairest solution.<BR> Also hand to hand fighting abilities need to be raised to the level of any of the weapons we shouldn't have to chose to use a weapon because it has more damage output but rather because it has a desirable effect and/or good stats.<BR> Another thing is skill levels why am I missing when I have grand master level skills?(above 200 skill) I shouldn't be missing at all, the only reason I should ever miss is that the mob makes me miss, dodges, parries, riposts, blocks etc...   <BR> And the special attacks we get they should be able to be usefull for the life of the character. Kick for instance we can get that skill up to 250 but why would we? It doesn't do anymore damage at level 250 skill that it did at level 1 skill, all those skills should be evened out damage wise as you get higher up in skill the delay time for using them should go down so that by the time you have 250 skill in kick for instance it should refreash faster that sense heading does. It would be nice if you gave each a special ability after say 20 levels after you first get the skill not everything has to bunched up in the 50's. <BR> Another thing you decided to bunch up in the 50's is the weight limit I think it should start far earlier like at level 25 and every 5 levels after that so when you get to level 60 it's the 22 limit you have now. <BR> One more thing is the disciplines they don't all have to start in the 50's either some could be started way earlier stone stance could start at level 40 for instance. The attack type disciplines should be changed into skills thunder kick, ashen hand, one hundred blows etc... <BR> Fiegn death should be changed, the success should be based on your level of skill verses the level of the mob and the reagro should be based upon whether or not the mob sees you again, out of sight out of mind, mobs shouldn't have a psychic ability to tell when you're gotten back up again from a successfull fiegn. Also the skill level should be raised and with the raise a chance to fiegn against summoning mobs.<BR> Our armor class could be raised some either through items or natural ability and the rate at which our defense raises at the higher skill levels needs to be adjusted I'm level 51 and my defense skill is only 206 it hasn't even reached the pre 51 cap yet of 230 it goes up like every 3 weeks that's way to slow. <BR> Well that's all i can think of for now i hope some of these posts get through to the verant staff and they seriousely consider them.<BR>Thank you for your time.<P>Silverfist Swiftfoot 51 disciple Bristlebane<BR>     </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor (Alan),<P>I'll first admit that I haven't taken the time to fully sift through the hundreds of rather lengthy posts.  But, your comments were posted on eqvault.com and there's a few points I wanted to bring forward.<P>Verant's Vision of the monk, and their 'role'.<BR>I struggled with this one a bit, as the role I've always known for monks is the puller.  Yet according to past statements by Gordon, pulling (especially FD pulling) was not in the Vision.  So what's left?  To me, the vision was an altnernative to warrior, but more reliant on skills rather than equipment.  Yet, in doing so, having a skill based clone of a warrior would be rather dull, so there needs to be a difference between the two.  This is where the monk's 'niche' among the pure melee classes comes in.  In my opinion, if you were to take rogues, warriors, and monks, then rate them in both offense and defense, monks would be #2 in each category, going 'half way' in the difference between warriors and rogues in each category.  As I understand it now, monks are marginally better than warriors in offense, yet fall far behind rogues w/ backstab.  On defense, monks are about on the same levels as rogues.  I'll go further into both offense and defense.<P>Offense - pre-kunark, monks had it good.  They did a good deal of damage with their fists, leaving warriors behind and almost crept on rogue damage w/backstab (so maybe we did slightly too much damage).  We also enjoyed a nice skill advantage in offense.  Hand to Hand, 1h blunt,and 2h blunt all capped higher as well, but they were a moot point pre-kunark.  <P>But, the advent of kunark drastically changed things.  First, weapons for all 3 classes came out with damage potential unheard of before, with them overall being of the same caliber.  The only exception were a few ultra rare monk staves that were a small notch above everything else, also monk fists only went down 4 delay through 10 hell levels.  Also, the skill advantage in offense shrinked dramatically.  And on top of that, warriors received triple attack at 60, and rogues received double backstab and assassinate, those three abilities clearly augmenting their damage output.  Monks received no abilities along the same lines.  So whereas before the monk balance in damage was *slightly* in their favor, it's now more out of balance comparatively the opposite way than it was before.  Even with Velious, it's still the same and even worse.  Warriors and Rogues are getting better weapons than what they could in Kunark.  This time though, I have yet to see any monk weapons which clear 'upgrades' to the kunark weapons.<P>While I'd like to leave it up to you guys to make a proper solution, I'll at least throw in a  simple idea: instead of triple attack, double flying kick, special attack combos, or what have you, introduce an 'advanced offense' skill obtainable in the latter levels somewhere.  Since the dilemma with the skill advantage is that the code won't let the value exceed 252, why not just make a 'higher level' skill exclusively for monks that'd maybe add more atk/skill point?  To me this serves well because it's a) not flashy, b) not a clone of another class'ability, c) adds more damage, and d) doesn't drastically change how the class will be played. As for weapons, the bonus in advanced offense could offset the weapon 'problem', since I realize there isn't much room to upgrade without being deemed as 'too damaging'.  Anyhoo, onward...<P>defense - Again, in the pre-kunark world, life was good for a monk in the defense department.  Yeah, we couldnt tank or take the hits like the warrior, but we could still take a pounding, unlike a rogue.  The biggest reason for this was, again, our skill advantage(s).  We capped significantly higher in defense, and also capped higher, or just as high in dodge, block (parry), and riposte.  And while we did ***** about our sub par planar armor, monks were still decent defensive wise.<P>But again, that has changed after Kunark.  The skill advantage has dwindled, rogues and warriors got really nice ac upgrades on their class specific gear, and monk did not even get a high level class specific set.  Instead, we received crescent armor that had the AC (and in some cases lower) of cured silk.  Also, the mobs in Kunark hit harder and have more hp than their antonican counterparts.  In summary, our ac and evasion abilities did not increase much at all while both rogues and warriors received good skill increases and received good armor upgrades.<P>If I were to present a solution, it'd be almost the same as above with offense, with the difference of also upping the evasion skills as well.  The same reasons as above for why this would be good.<P>I hope this has been somewhat enlightening on the monk as a whole.  I understand there is no 'hard' evidence here (although I'm sure there's some from the monk community who have it), but it's more the idea I am trying to portray.  I think the solutions fall in line with my interpretation of Verant's Vision for a monk by maintaining a skill advantage rather than relying heavily on equipment, etc.<P>Good luck to you  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The Pure melee balance.<P>Firstly this only affects pure meleers Monks, Rogues, Warriors. Balance can not be talked about in isolation from other classes of the same type, however talking about monk v cleric balance makes no sense, they do different things.<P>I am only interested however myself in monk balance. I guess this is in response to the sugestion that monks shouldn't do more damage the warriors.<P>Damage output toe to toe.<BR>1. Monk (tie)<BR>1. Warrior (tie)<BR>3. Rogue<BR>note. they are all very close, some would argue the difference between the damage output of epic or betetr equiped meleers is so close toe to toe its a null point. Depends on weapons and what level you make the comparison.<P>Damage output in group or raid situation.<BR>1. Rogue <BR>2. Monk (tie)<BR>2. Warrior (tie)<BR>note. Rogue is a long way ahead, Monk and warrior very close.<P>Damage absorbtion/avoidance/healing efficiency as main tank.<BR>1. Warrior.<BR>2. Monk.<BR>3. Rogue.<BR>note. Warrior is way ahead. Even more so with disc defensive.<P>Damage absorbtion/avoidance/healing efficiency as secondary tank.<BR>1. Rogue.<BR>2. Warrior.<BR>3. Monk.<BR>note. Rogue a long way ahead thanks to evade.<P>Utility and extra non combat abilitys.<BR>1. Rogue.<BR>2. Monk.<BR>3. Warrior.<BR>note. Warrrior has very little in this department. But also has the most options options via weapon procs and armour clicks.<P>Armour selection options<BR>1. Warrior.<BR>2. Rogue.<BR>3. Monk.<BR>note. Monk a long way behind here.<P>Weapon selection options<BR>1. Warrior.<BR>2. Rogue.<BR>3. Monk.<BR>note. Monk a long way behind here, tho rogues primary weapon is limited to a poker really.<P>Overal Variety. (A bit of a fluff category I guess)<BR>1. Warrior. Most races and most equipment options.<BR>2. Rogue. A number of races, 3 illusions, and a large number of equipment options.<BR>3. Monk. 2 races, very limited equipment option.

It all starts with the sashes and the headbands, then leads into the RoLC, then you get RoWF and finally Celestial Fists."<P>Have you taken a look at the stats of the sash/headbands? There is a reason why no one does them. They suck. Compare these to any other classes armor quests. It jumps from newbie quests to post 50 quest. As I said before, the only reason why a monk would do the headband quest is to get the RoLC.

</FONT><HR>This is an idea that I believe will make monks more fun to play, without having a single effect on any stats or balancing issues whatsoever. I have noticed at my character log in screen that my monk will wield his weapons or fists with the various movement animations to include things he could not normally do. It is rather an amazing thing to watch as my monk wields dual staffs in an overhand 2hs type effect, etc. A simple change in the game, such as allowing these random animations for normal attacks, may make monks more interesting to watch and play, from a purely "fun" outlook</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>51 Monk on Karana.<P>This topic is about balance, and as such only small changes need to be made. While many people have some interesting suggestions, there is in reality only a few things that need to be adjusted so that higher level Monks feel useful in an average group.<P>1. Feign Death should not be seen through if a spell is resisted. Not much reasoning is needed to support this. Furthermore, FD past level 50 should lower aggression much more. The change to FD many months ago did not seem to take into consideration Kunark and Velious.<P>2. Monks should get a spell interrupt attack, not necessarily a stun. This will allow them to be effective against casters.<P>3. Monk innate damage should be increased significantly. Personally I like using some weapons and am thankful for the opportunity to have options. However, a Monk's hand to hand damage should be increased. Perhaps some changes in disciplines could allow this. Minimum damage on flying kicks and thunder kick would help but not enough. I agree with the idea of giving Monks an off-hand bonus when using fists. After reading all these posts, you should probably be clear that the vision for Monks is to be the supreme master of toe to toe damage (not by just a little)<P>4. AC is fine, but please do us the favor of increasing the stats of Shiverback-Hide armor. It really is an embarassment. Every other class drools over their Planar armor. Monks destroy it.<P>Those are the things that would bring Monks in balance in my opinion. Reading below is my list of things we "should" have, according to me.<P>1. Weight limit scaled past 50 instead of tiered<BR>2. Robes and Celestial Fists quests should be no drop, as discussed here at length. They don't need to be harder, they need to be short-cut proof.<BR>3. Panther armor should be much lighter.<BR>4. Shield of Rainbow Hues should look like a shimmering hue shield instead of a round wooden shield with a spike in the middle.<P>Overall, I believe Monks to be a wonderfully enjoyable class. We have many great abilities that make us distinctive. Please consider this post as a support for Bodhi's and Zadkiels and Kages previously posted ideas.<P>Delphaeus<BR>Stormbringers of Karana<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well I haven't reached 50+ yet with my Monk, but the few things that I see as I am leveling that I think should be changed are:<P>1.  Monks should rely more on their body for damage.  I loved the idea when I started my monk that I would not be bothered with having to find a better weapon.  <P>2.  Monks should be able to use their Fists and Feet at the same time is should not be classified as the same type of attack. even if it ment a bit long repop time on the skills.<P>3.  Monks have a weight limit that must be kept to keep some bonus stats.  In my personal opinion I think that Monks shouldn't be big damage dealers as may monks are requesting.  But the way that I think of Monks more of the type that don't get hit very often.  I think because of our lowered AC and HP compared to Warriors I think it would be a better idea to give us a better defensive skills.  From the information that I have been reading Warriors and Monks get very similiar defensive skills,  Warriors are usually bigger bulkier and heavier, and monk are smaller and lighter therefore should have a much better chance at move out of the way of an attack.<P>4.  I also personally think that monks should be the best at throwing (don't know if they are already or not)<P>5.  I like the ideas that I have seen about providing our kicks and punches with effects.  I would like to see this implemented after a skill reached a certain level (eg 200) that way the other Skills like the basic Punch anf Kick might have some usefullness in the higher levels,  The way it is working now is once you get the upgrade kick or punch you just leave the other behind.<P>Anyways thats just my opinion,  as I said I haven't made it past 50 yet but these are what I have seen along my travels.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Yet another posting from a monk at work, with no time to read all the 250+ posts, but got through the 100 or so first ones  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>First of all, I am a roleplaying monk. I have sworn off any kind of weapon, because the weapons pollute my monk's soul, and are only in his way when fighting. To this end, my wishes for balancing the monk are quite obvious:<P>1) Raise the defensive skills on the monk. If we cant hit more, then we should be able to avoid more damage. I've tried using gear to get my agility near the 200's, and I've tried maxing my AC (near 900 atm), neither seem to do any difference. I get as much hit, if not more, than the warrior standing next to me. We are supposed to be masters of avoiding damage. To my experience, we are not. At 51, I miss too much, and I get hit too hard. High AC, or High AGI, I've tried both, neither seem to make a difference to the blue mobs that I'm fighting.<P>2) As agreed upon by the majority of the monks that have posted here, I too would like to see a minimum damage on my flying kick post 50. I'd go as far as to ask for level = minimum damage. The difference to the damage output should not be that big, since the mobs we fight have endless (at least they seem to) hitpoints at those levels anyway. <P>3) FD failure message when seen through: PLEASE! YES!<P>4) We allready give up our chances to loot/sell items to get some money. Please either reduce the weight that the coins have, so that at least we don't have to destroy all that gold, OR, provide more coin-weight reducing items<P>5) The quest for the Robe of The lost Circle is insane, especially the wait for brother Qwinn to appear in South Karana. Please do something about this. I spent 13 days there, with nothing to do, since all mobs are green at the level you're ready to meet him. Spams to the zone, and petitions due to his rarity are a nuance not only to the monk questing, but to every player in SK, and the poor guides that are on and have to deal with the frustrated monks.<P>6) Thunderkick - minimal damage should equal no less than maximum damage of flying kick. period. Double the waiting time for it, but don't make us look bad "Lands a thunderous kick for (24) points of damage"?? From feet that GLOW??<P>7) Last but not least: Feign dead. It's there, it should work. I'm ok with the way it works in Antonica, even in Karnor's, but too often, I feign without any error "fallen to the ground", and still get beaten upon. The monk should always be able to bring back a single mob to the party, otherwise, we're nothing but a warrior with little tanking ability.<P>Repeat on the fists: Please make it so that I do not have to consider weapons. We are body fighters, not ninja warriors. At least give us a good choice!<P>Patife Kaivalya<BR>&lt;Cymbrogi&gt;<BR>51'th Disciple on Mith Marr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>PLEASE ANSWER BODI'S POST! Ignore my post if you like, but that post is important!<P>Sorry about being that emphatic, but the monk community spent a lot of time coming up with that list after seeing you answer a previous list related to another class in its completeness.<P>&gt;This was only a thought, as I am not really <BR>&gt;convinced that monks really need any new skills. <BR>&gt;They have a pretty solid selection as it is.<P>Well... let's see. Monk caps at level 60 that are different than warrior caps, for the skills that both share:<P>1hb - war 250, mnk 252<BR>2hb - war 250, mnk 252<BR>hand to hand - war 200, mnk 252<BR>bind wounds - war 210, mnk 210<BR>dodge - war 175, mnk 230<BR>dual wield - war 240, mnk 252<BR>kick - war 210, mnk 250<BR>block/parry - war 230, mnk 230<BR>double attack - war 245, mnk 250<P>Skills that monks have that warriors don't:<P>mend<BR>throwing (used only for pulling, and warriors have archery)<BR>safe fall<BR>sneak (capped much lower than rogues, as it should be)<BR>feign death (whenever it works)<BR>instill doubt/round kick/dragon punch/tail rake/eagle strike/flying kick (lumped together, since you can only use one at a time)<P>Disadvantages monks have that warriors don't:<P>Very little weapon selection, and those most damaging weapons are very rare (e.g., tranquil staff)<BR>Really, REALLY horrible weight restriction, with a loss of 5-6 AC per weight unit over 14.9 - I can't emphasize this enough, since I have probably thrown away over 20,000-30,000 plat in the amount of time I've played, and this seriously limits the equipment I can wear<BR>Poor resists on most equipment<BR>No taunt, so harder to get mobs off casters when we want to (and FD doesn't work extremely well to get them off us, either)<BR>Low, low HP<BR>Uniform look from level 1 to level 60<BR>No spell casting armor set except the Velious quest armor<P><BR>WE DON'T WANT TO BE WARRIORS! However, we wish to contribute to groups as well as warriors do, and we should given the tradeoffs between our admittedly nice set of skills and huge, punishing disadvantages.<P>We have our own vision for the monk class, whether Verant does or not. PLEASE READ BODI'S POST, and try and understand where we're coming from. The monk class is not an easy class to play, unless you have a rich uncle or aunt. But then, most classes are easy to play that way.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have played a monk since I bought the game. In fact, the concept of the monk is the whole reason for me playing. I have always been a big fan/supporter of Martial Arts..... That said I believe the issue could be addressed with two simple to program changes that would create slightly better soloing, better worth to a group, and move monks away from the weapon dependance a bit. (Personally I think a 50+ monk with a weapon should be an embarrasement to Verant as it is exactly the opposite of the concept of a classic martial artist)<P>1. Increase base AC by approx 10%. Either for anytime the weight is below 15 or maybe 1%-2% increase per stone under 15 (ie. 14=2%, 13=3%, 12=4%, 11=5%, 10=6%, 9=8%, 8=10%) So if I ditch my weapons and heavier armor and get my weight down to 9 stone I have 8% better ac than I would with a 15 weight. This would make the lighter armor such as crescent more valuable and increase the value of quested items (ie treant fists) as well as pull people from the weapons to a more classic fist/foot fighting style.<P>2. Unbind the foot/fist attacks. This would increase our damage output some but not make it overpowering, is more realistic, and would be very easy to fix from a programmers approach.<P>The weight is obviously looked at by the computer already on a monk. Increasing the increments which are looked at should not be a large programming nightmare and un"hooking" kick, round kick, and flying kick from the fist attacks would give us not triple attack but maybe an additional attack every 2 to 3 rounds.<P>Thank you for entertaining our desires. I love the game and especially the monk. I wish we were more fist based and less like the "other" classes but now we are due to the massive amount of weapons and armor that monks use. You couldn't possibly go through all the monk usable equipment/items so just give encouragement to not use them. <P>My 2 cents.<P>Taodo Suntzu<BR>Prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 8 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053593&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053593&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
