</FONT><HR>Before I propose this idea, I want to disclaim the fact that I understand how HARD this would be to change. At the same time, if Verant doesn't adopt some kind of change like this, I think it will have a difficult time competing against new games that come out in the future.<P>VERANT SHOULD REMOVE THE NECESSITY FOR SPELLCASTERS TO MEDITATE<P>Now, before you freak out, hear me out...<P>Unless I'm wrong, the concept of mana is there to ensure that spellcasters don't just go crazy casting zillions of spells and getting unreasonable power. The mana pool is what keeps the spellcasters balanced with the other classes.<P>Keeping the spellcasters balanced with the other classes is, of course, and absolute necessity for the game, but it think there could be an implementation which is more reasonable.<P>As all casters know, and I'm sure Verant is aware too, a tremendous part of being a spellcaster is staring at your spellbook. For the clerics, this is even more true. <BR>  Keep an eye on your mana bar<BR>  Keep an eye on your party members<BR>  Stand up to cast heals<BR>  Open up your spellbook again<BR>  Give Verant money<BR>  Repeat<P>A caster's life is generally spent doing nothing... waiting.<P>I believe this downtime is not only unnecessary, it is also a reason why some competing game company could have a tremendous advantage against Verant. Which would you choose? Everquest, or Everclone that gives you all the same abilities, but doesn't require you to wait for anything.<P>So, how do you keep game balance if you remove mana? Spell delays, casting times, refresh times - many of the tools already employed. For example, as a necromancer, my spell Harmshield takes 10 minutes before I can cast it again. My ability to cast it has nothing to do with my mana pool. It's all about the refresh delay. <P>I'll give you an example of how this could work with a cleric, for example. Complete heal, which is a very useful spell, would have a long refresh time - maybe 5 minutes. The cleric couldn't cast Complete Heal in that time. Instead, our healer would have to rely on other healing spells in the mean time. There could be a low level heal which has effectively no refresh time for the cleric, so they could cast it more regulary. Or maybe they have a heal spell that doesn't fizzle while you're moving and fighting, so they could be in combat at the same time. The cleric would join the combat with the rest of the tanks and use their mighty hammer to smite the enemies, being careful to time when they cast their spells, and on who.<P>Pullers would make sure the casters have got all their spells back before bringing something nasty back to the party.<P>Instead of INT/WIS giving you more mana, they would decrease the refresh times for lower level spells. As you became more powerful, and got more gear, you could cast the lower level spells more quickly - eventually almost non-stop. But the powerful spells you would have to manage carefully.<P>Breeze/clarity would decrease refresh times; necro Allure of Death, etc, would exchange life for decreased refresh times.<P>The bottom line is that that casters would be just as busy as the rest of the party. While they're waiting for the long refresh times to come back, they're casting other spells, or mixing it up in melee. They would have to be careful, and balance their use of spells, but essentially there would be no downtime: just fun.<P>I want to be clear, under this revised system, PROGRESSION OF ALL CLASSES WOULD BE IDENTICAL, AND COMPLETELY BALANCED.<P>I believe the concept of mana as a method of maintaining balance is only one of the many available to Verant.<P>As players, we give Verant money, and Verant gives us fun. In my opinion, Verant has done SO many things right. I love this game. But downtime sucks - and given a choice between Everquest and a game that has no downtime, that's no contest for me.<P>I know, I know, if I don't want downtime, I should go play a warrior. No, I want to play a spellcaster, and I want no downtime. Any game companies want my money? <P>Maybe I'm just a little grumpy; however, after having spent two complete evenings attempting to organize a group to go to Split Paw and then Cazik Thule. <BR>  Find who wants to go<BR>  Recruit new people<BR>  Bind the warriors in Arena<BR>  Wait while someone goes linkdead<BR>  One player has been waiting too long and needs to go to bed.<BR>  Recruit another member<BR>  Go back to Arena to bind them.<BR>  Enter Cazik<BR>  Warrior dies from a train as we're going in.<BR>  Wait until he makes the run back from Arena.<BR>  No one wants to play anymore.<BR>  Go to bed.<P>Tell me that was necessary, or fun, or part of the "Vision". Verant has 300,000 players who tolerate downtime, but only because there isn't anything better on the market... yet.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>well personally i dont believe that would be a better solution to the problem you descbribe. Just ask anyone that takes massive damage in high dungeons if i as a cleric can keep them alive if i can only cast complete heal every 5 minutes. I am not the best cleric in the game but i have gotten to the point now where i never have to say OUT OF MANA  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>excal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think Typhus has a point here, though.<P>But I don't think he's representing it properly. This would not remove downtime, but it would definitely make it "feel" less time consuming. Even if the spells had the same refresh time as the time it takes to meditate now, it'd probably be a lot more fun.<P>This isn't something for Everquest, probably, but it'd be interesting to see it in future MMOGs.<P>- dpk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absolutely. I'm saying they should balance the system so you can keep your high level dungeon group just as healed as you currently can.<P>You just don't have to spend any time staring at your spellbook. <P>What percentage of those combats to you spend sitting and waiting for your mana to recover?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You don't spend time looking at your spell book after 35th.<P>You really don't spend time running around binding people after around 40-45 when you can be fairly certain there will be a rez.<P>If casters had unlimited mana, why not give melee classes unlimited hitpoints?<P>On the OTHER hand, if you do away with "must sit down to meditate" that would be a nice change. You think clerics and shaman want their epic weapon so they can melee with it? No... would be nice if there was no reason for them not to though.<P>Perhaps at level 51 you 'half meditate' while standing up, at 55th you 'three quarter medidate' and at 60th you 'full meditate' while stand up. I still find it hard to believe that back in the design days of EverQuest they said, 'Ya, and when the group is going to be fighting a monster, lets make it so all the mana users in the party sit down.' I don't think words like "camping" or "pulling" ever were meant to be a part of the game. Just evolved to that.<P>Heck, I think that after 35th you should never need to sit down to meditate... in fact, its my opinion that meditation IS the single largest cause of camping. Spell casters burn all their mana in the fight, sit down to med, tell the group, '80% mana', and the warrior who's been keeping time says, 'room behind us respawned, I'll go bring the mobs here... be right back.' Boom, camping is born.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm not saying give casters unlimited mana. I'm saying remove the concept of mana and replace it with some other limiting factor that ensure the rate of progression by the group is exactly the same.<P>Refresh delays were one suggestion, but maybe there's something else.<P>Your insight is right on the money, though. People don't explore dungeons because you need to sit and med. It forces the strategy of casters medding while a puller brings targets back. If you didn't have to restrict your movement while your spells restored, you could explore dungeons the was I belive Verant intended.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Every time something has been suggested to eliminate sitting and meditateing Verant has responded with something like this.<P><BR>Players having the choice to sit down to regain mana faster brings a strategic element to the game. Monsters react differently to a sitting player than a standing player.<P>I agree it does add the strategic element. The problem is that as you gain higher levels, your mana regen while standing never changes. At the lower levels it really is a very strategic choice. At the higher levels however, a caster has to keep sitting down to retain their usefulness. The choice of strategies lessens into what is nothing more than a choice of how often can I get away with it. At the lower levels there was once upon a time a choice of standing and swinging with your weapon. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think Verant's defense of sitting and medding has always been based on the fact that they want to maintain game balance. Or something like that.<P>There must be a better way. Using stamina is a good idea, but it would need to recover. And stamina recovers faster while you're sitting down, so back to the concept of mana. Verant already has a system in place to manage spell refresh times.<P>You're right, at the higher levels mana recovers so slowly that there's almost no point standing. You can fight if you like, but you won't be able to cast any spells for the duration of the combat.<P>This isn't a strategic choice.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If you want to get rid of mana, but keep the balance, here's an idea.<P>When you cast a spell, it de-mems it, clearing out that spell gem/slot.  Allow multiple memorizations of a spell, so you can load up on whatever combo of 8 spells you wish.  However, when you use up your spells, you will need to re-mem it.<P>It would replace the stress and long downtime of mana with the stress and short downtime of juggling what 8 spells you have loaded.  Whole new stratagies would be needed in a fast paced fight, as the caster would have fewer options right at their fingertips.<P>Mind you, I don't see such a change ever going into EQ.

</FONT><HR>Now we're cooking. That's a great idea! Or maybe spells of a certain level stop dememming once you've mastered them (X levels higher than when you got the spells). Now you've got real strategies to consider.<P>Stick with the spells you've mastered, or take some of the spells that will demem after you cast them. I think there would still be some need for spell delays, though. Otherwise, I would have to stare at my spellbook while I change spells.
