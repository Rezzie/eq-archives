Also a rand type NPC with misc names ... Hall Monitor Willy, Life (A spectre .. very funny), a bee type (forgot her name), and another bee in the forest chasing a lil halfling ...<P>Also of note are the 4 halflings outside surronding the treasure chest outside ... they change positions from time to time ... circling and crossing over each other ...

</FONT><HR>As far as using gate potions for the cleric, there is an exit in the zone. I accidently (I'm still crying over doing it) clicked on some tree/sky at the left end of the courtyard (Left facing the Castle), and was transported to Cobalt Scar, loc 0, 0. I obviously didn't go searching for the exact loc when I ran back to PoM, but it might be worthwhile for your cleric. If you want, I'll get the exact loc from one of the casters I have up there.<P>And, as I mentioned yesterday, I've started working on a compilation of information. http://www.swtoys.net/pom/ Only the maze is up so far (Hopefully the most difficult section to map, spent nearly 10 hours on it today), but I'll work on getting other sections up as the week progresses, as well as adding where each trap drops you in the maze. Hopefully presenting EVERY single piece of information on the zone might enable someone to decipher exactly what we are supposed to do. And beware clicking on the link, it will ruin the zone for you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Also, do that AND the YOU SHALL NOT PASS, kill the not guy. see what that leaves, and try different permeatations of it.

</FONT><HR>As an alternative to years of mindless guessing (yes I consider 35 thousand social buttons mindless guessing as effective as it may be  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> ) maybe more focas should be being placed upon actually finding an easy way to get to Plane of Mischef.  Once you can get hundreds of people there, things tend to solve themselves.  People pick up on little things that cant be solved with a thread like this ect ect ect.<P>Anyway for starters on that theory, how about the lava area in ToV?  I saw a map and it seemed like there was a very large place with lava, would it be at all possible theres a hidden tunnel in this lava that gives a more direct route to PoM castle?<P>Worth a look.<P>Also are there any mobs around the 86?  To 86 someone can mean to kill them.  If there is a mob that seems connected to 86, perhaps it has to die before you can advance any farther in the puzzle.  Does it respond to any hails or "Who do you want me to 86?" types of things?<P>Yet another thing worth a look.<P>Good luck Iron  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  see ya in SD at the fanfaire  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You said that the halflings change positions from time to time. Are those the numbered halflings? If yes, then maybe it's something about the way they do that. Maybe the numbers are just there to confuse you, and the actual sequence in which they have to be "used" (in whatever way) is determined by the sequence in which they move.<BR><BR>i.e. <BR>Five moves first = 1<BR>Two moves second = 2<BR>Six moves third = 3<BR><BR>And so on.

Maybe "i like this one"<BR>  is how you move the chess peices.<P>3) If its a game, maybe they respond to old chess<BR>   moves ie knight to b3 or the new system a4.<BR>   or maybe you have to do something with the<BR>   "i like this one(move)" mob.<P>4) It looks like each are is a small self-contained<BR>   puzzle.  Would be interested to see where<BR>   the cards droped. Ie, these blue cards<BR>   in this area, the others in this one.<P><BR>5) Are there a lot of kos mobs there?<BR>   Ever tried dancing with the splinxes?<BR>   <P>Well just my 2cents.<P><BR>Number 5 is alive, lol<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>did you try hailing the NPCs with emotes (/bonk, /laugh, /rofl, /rude, /dance, ...) ? Or try to invite them in group ? Did you try to invoke BB by shouting his name in the zone ?<P>Except the name of NPCs, is there any other number in some place ? I mean, 0 is not a number ... You can map 1, 2 or 3 to a lot of things, but 0 ? The only thing coming to my mind is the 3 kind of cards and 0 being the joker, but from what I heard, I am not sure cards are linked to any specific puzzle. <P>In fact, I think cards are used later, once something else happened ... Maybe to play with BB. It dont looks like other puzzles are related to cards. However, what about giving to anonymous pieces (random piece, other piece, etc...) cards to "tag" them with what they really are (knights for example to take one of the kings) ?  <P>Also, post 50 classes have different names. One can try to put someone whith a chess-like title into strategic places around kings.<P>Can you post screenshots of every place that looks like a puzzle ? Like the YOU SHALL NOT PASS, for example. By the way, I hope Verant had a thought about non primarily-english-speaking players when they designed their puzzles. Even a simple language-based puzzle can be missed by the ones whom english is not the native language. This make me think that if there is some, it must be very simple, like eliminate the "NOT", the difficulty being to find how to eliminate it, since killing it seems not to be the right way. Does he despawn ?<P>The key of the whole seems to be BB. But he may be disguised. What are the illusions available to rogues and bards ? Is there any other NPC looking like this in the zone ?<P>And note that Verant said the way used to go to PoM wasn't the one they thought about. Some MoBs in ToV on the "regular" way to PoM may give some hints ... </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Ok I'd like to think I can add some useful ideas to this search albeit nothing specifically pertaining to the mobs/zone structure of PoM itself.  And I've read everything on the safehouse and here and all the links in this thread but correct me if I'm incorrect here. <BR>1 - Bristlebane only pops for 5-10 seconds or so at 9am EQ days.  Now from my experience with the game engine this isn't for the player's benefit because Verant wouldn't give you 5-10 seconds to complete a trade or hail or pickpocket him or really interact with him in any way.  And since this hasn't been "fixed" (I'm sure killing Bristlebane, or illusion of, to a glitch spawn having been published would make Verant fix that pretty quickly as a "god" killed by accident isn't something you would leave in, well and the timing thing w/ Ester being in zone - I'm rambling anyway...)  I must assume that it spawns to check some condition in the zone - most likely another mob being activated somehow.  And since it's on EQ day time I would think that it would have some significance on it's regularity - in that the condition text that you must "wait til morning" or 9 am or something.  <P>2 - Wasn't the way that PoM has been reached and *can* be reached a fluke really?  I mean that a raid of nearly all 60s couldn't get there at all and that a monk using FD and using an item with a charge of rez on a mage to CotH others up there.. is that supposed to be designed for that?  I seriously doubt Verant playtested that eventuality.  And the fact that there has appeared new npcs that quad for a gabillion placed at the spot that the monk used to rez the mage for CotH and from what I have heard from Ester - basically getting there the way you all have is something Verant couldn't/didn't guard against.  Therefore there *has* to be an alternate entrance or (much more likely IMO) a different avenue to reach the already known entrance.  And if there's a way to get there without killing the mobs along the way and without dodging them there's probably some exotic quest that raises your faction with all those dragons that are currently kos to everyone.  Or the idea of a secret wall and passageway to near the PoM dollhouse sounds equally likely.  The main reason why I think this will help inside PoM is that there's no backstory or reason for PoM being in Temple of Veeshan or it being past a horde of dragons that seem unkillable and unavoidable except to FD hop.  There's got to be some backstory or reason for Bristlebane's domain to be in a temple devoted to Veeshan and full of Veeshanese followers (dragons).  I could almost believe Verant was placing it randomly and putting the almost unavoidable dragons just for the assurance that only the uberest guilds in all of EQ ever got to attempt it's puzzle...  but there are no leads in PoM to be found, no npc text, no discernable quests(Cept for the sphinx who wants the the stolen something but that sounds like flavor IMO).  If you are missing the clues and leads for PoM then it seems like you might've skipped a step: finding out how to get there and actually getting there the correct way.  I mean you can't jump over that and dismiss it like it doesn't matter - how in the *world* are you *supposed* to get to PoM?  The mage/monk trick is just that, a trick, and fighting there seems futile.  And Ester mentioned on her visit how they got there without a rogue or something akin to that?  Sounds like something needs to be picked and that it warps the group from somewhere else in ToV TO the dollhouse.  Perhaps something in the non-kos CoV faction portion. Point being: you missed a step of how to get there legitimately I think.<P>3 - Sometimes when I'm working on a puzzle in a game that's particularly tough I'll go all the way back through the game looking for something I missed or an item I didn't pick up or testing for secrets.  But 9 times of 10 the solution is almost right on top of the problem so I'll have confused myself even further.  I completely believe that you don't have to play King's Court with the cards or with any npcs because that King's Court reference in Bristlebane's bio was put in in beta.  And old quests and new quests *really* don't intertwine so any other quest having cards to do with it is also a waste of time.  Everyone approaches a puzzle from a different perspective on what the answer could be.  Some people don't rule particular possibilities out and other people rule out nearly everything but one answer.  You need different kinds of people for riddles, it would be awesome if Irontaail could figure this out as no one is more deserving of it but it's almost impossible to wipe your knowledge and perspective clean to approach froma unique angle after so long spent grinding down the problem your way.  Either the real way to PoM has to be found or you guys have got to provide some really detailed information on how you could get there without a monk/mage w/ CotH so more than just a dozen or so on a few servers have even the chance to solve it. <BR> <BR>4 - The theme.  Mischief.  Why is the plane of mischief a dollhouse?  Fear's entrance is a huge scary looking door with orange screen surrounded by spectres.  Hate's entrance is kind of the component for the wizard TP spell, a fuligan soulstone of Innoruuk which I *think* is a heart black with hate.  And Tunare's plane's entrance is a tree in a forest.  All fitting in a way.  What does the dollhouse mean?  Does it mean this is a realm where Bristlebane controls all the shots and plays games with "dolls" and makes pretend?  This is certainly backed up by the puupets of the other gods and the stage, because I can see no other way of Bristlebane getting a good laugh then to watch the other gods bop each other on the head with a mallet and act stupid for his enjoyment.  So this would lead back to the theatre and puppets being more crucial than say the cards (and I mean the npcs not the loot).  There's definately a way to get Bristlebane to put on a show with his puppets, although whether the CT puppet really is the key to this or not (he could just be making fun of the CT puppet for running away ergo being "afraid" get it?) it's very much in tune with getting some productivity out of BB.  Obviously in that incarnation he has no loot.   If he did decide to put on his puppet show might there be a specific showtime, perhaps 9 am? (hint hint) <P>A small disclaimer:  I am very aware I made a boatload of assumptions here based from secondhand material and I tried to be as coherent as possible while explaining my reasonings behind these ideas.  What I really hope to lend you with these ideas are a way to help you rethink or at least reexamine the angle at which you are trying to solve this from inside PoM.  Hopefully you hatched some insight from my ramblings.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><BR>And I am a rogue that worships Bristlebane so maybe I know something!! hehe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A couple ideas:<P>1) Bristlebane's Cards.  There are cards laying around.  Bristlebane is a madman.  Does this mean he's not currently playing with a [full deck]?<P>2) The Chessboard.  The cards themselves appear to be of twelve discrete type:  Red, Blue, Black against Squire, Knight, Crown, Jester.<P>Looking at the Chess pieces, you've got Pawns, Knights and Kings (Queens?) which correspond nicely to Squire, Knight, Crown.<P>Is there some way to hand the gorillas the cards?  Would it be possible for them to simply be the piece movers?  You hand them the right piece, and they go move it for you.  <P>Are the pieces actually doors, and the right card being clicked on them unlocks the way?<P>How do the colors correspond to the pieces on the chessboard?  Dunno.  But hey, seems worth a try.<P>Also, with regards to the 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 etc...<P>Maybe they are the keepers of the steps of solving the puzzle.  Try asking "1" what the [first step] is, or what you should do [first].<P>If that's the case, I bet 22 (i.e. Catch-22) tells you what pitfall to avoid, and 86 tells you how to restart.<P>Hey, couldn't tell you for sure, but it all makes for a nice theory, doesn't it?<P>-pskought =)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I'm actually quite intrigued if Bristlebane gives a response to "Cazic Thule was afraid to perform" , "Cazic Thule puppet had stage fright" or "Cazic Thule puppet had a fear of the stage". Considering he shouts "Where be my Cazic Thule puppet? Ridiculously funny!", the idea that a joke in response seems interesting.<P>Also, the pieces on the chessboard CANNOT be moved by any possible means. They are built into the zone, and therefore are not meant to despawn/be moved. The gorillas could move, but not the chess pieces.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>All I can say is WOW ... what a bunch of new idaes ..hehe. <P>Thanks Dorian for mentioning that the Chessboard colors alterante, I forgot to say that. And thats to those who pointed out that those are prolly kings and not queens. I dont play chess that much, anymore. 8-(<P>Some things I can mention:<P>1 - no NPC seems to despawn except the halflings in the main room, that reappear if you attack something in there, and the 1 wandering gaurd who seems to change every so often (not sure on timer) ... Hall Monitor Willy, Life, the bee.<P>2 - You can dance with the Sphinxs .. it stuns you takes all your stamina and spins you like the "Spin the bottle" from Bristlebanes Bundle spell that Mages have.<P>3 - We did kill "NOT" .. so the woards left were YOU SHALL    PASS .. didnt seem to do anything we could find ... I know someone also suggested getting rid of him without killing him ... not sure how to do that, but I will train 86 there if I can find a way to to try that.<P>4 - We seem to think you could access PoM without being KOS if you were to do the Halls of Testing faction, by completing the CoV Dragon quests ... not sure, but maybe someone who has that faction from doing Dragon quests could try and see and post here.<P>5 - There are only 10 cards, not 12.<P>1) Red Squire (common)<BR>2) Black Squire (common)<BR>3) Blue Squire (common)<BR>4) Red Knight (uncommon - higher lvl npc's)<BR>5) Black Knight (uncommon - higher lvl npc's)<BR>6) Blue Knight (uncommon - higher lvl npc's)<BR>7) Red Crown (rare - higher lvl npc's)<BR>8) Black Crown (rare - higher lvl npc's)<BR>9) Blue Crown (rare - higher lvl npc's)<BR>10) Jester (no color - we only recieved 2 of these so far, 1 form Fenj and 1 from "my right hand" .. both very high lvl and we killed about 30 of them and only found 2 Jesters)<P><BR>OK ... now new Ideas Ive yet to try ....<P>1 - Fishing .. will start tonight<P>2 - Finding an Invisible trade guy (looking still)<P>3 - Using more chess move sayings (suggestins?)<P>4 - Using a Damage Shield on Number 5 to kill him (I can get a DS potion and try that tonight)<P>5 - using more Emotes to talk to npcs (Suggestions? as to what ones you want me to try?)<P>6 - using a class name like a High level Paladin or class title as a chess piece .. ie Knight<P>7 - Use Cancel Magic on NPCs' to check for illusions (I love this one)<P>8 - The idea that Bristle Bane comes to check the status of the zone for a specific event .. interesting .. not sure what I can do .. but cool concept<P>9 - Ester mentioned she had been testing all day the cards .. indicating that it might be a long puzzle activating many parts to get a result<P>10 - I'll give info on the puppet spawn order .. they spawn in a certain order and some are agro and some are not .. does not appear to b part of your religion basis ... Turane and the Bristle Bane puppets soawn first .. Turane is agro, BB is not, there a re a few others agro .. but I will have to check the order<P>11 - Holding the cards when porting or using them to click on portals ... such as keys to zones ( I can try this tonight)<P>12 - Waiting around to April 1st .. HAHAH . I hope we get a hint (HINT HINT .. VI .. maybe BB could sit and talk to us in riddles?) if not solved by then .. heheh .. my RL wife is pregnant and I will have a new born by April 1st (she is due March 15th!!)<P>13 - Gorilla piece movers .. I love the idea, not quite sure again how to do this but great ideas . 8-)<P>14 - Card clicking chess pieces .. I will try that as well tonight<P>15 - I will also ask the numbers .. like what is step 1?, etc ...<P>16 - I will attempt training "86" around and see if he agros on anything else<P>17 - Also I will attempt to make screen shots of the entire zone .. and post them up in sequence order .. might take a while .. but I will attempt to do it.<P>Again .. WOW!! .. thanks for all the new ideas, and Sep and Coladar, specially (Dorian as well) for the maps and help in trying all these ideas .... Well we will overcome this zone.<P>Coladar and Sep ... do you want to get together either on the phone, email, etc .. if you are going to do NPC placement I can help or you can send me a map or post it and I can take a section and fill in the NPCs if you want?<P> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I hate to admit this .. but I cant continue to give the cards to NPC's .. 8-( with the exception of the ones that I can solo kill and get them back 8-(<P>I cant hand into the Gorrillas and numbered guys anymore, because I cant solo pull them (funny thing to hear comming from a monk) .. and even if I could they are just a lil out of my solo kill range even with a Clr dumping full mana of CH's into me. (I tested each of the areas to see what I could and what I couldnt kill). The numbers all hit at athe same time .. I am lucky to make it out of the room when you hit anything in the main room .. 13 NPC's .. it seems as though at least 8 are casting some sort of force shock with hefty damage .. hehe.. I once died while still being knocked around the room when I hit 1 NPC close to a door .. hehe.. was funny as heck though getting Force Shocked 8 times around the room ..heheh I ended up in every alcove and them up some stairs opposite where I was trying to pull .. hehe<P>Maybe the next Guild that gets up with a full force can try some more of the Card NPC hand ins in this room and the Gorillas .. hehe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It just surprises me that after all this time, no one has figured this out.  This (to my knowlege) is the longest an EQ mystery has ever been undecyphered.  If Verant has really put much effort into creating this zone and actually making it this gigantic puzzle that would take lots of mind power and time to finish - Awesome!  Well done Verant.  But just due to the history of the game, I don't really see it as being so.  They always said how their current game engine wouldn't let them do certain things and a lot of what is being talked about here seems to me like it would be beyond the capabilities of the game.  Though, I can always be wrong due to myself not being all that experienced nor do I know the full capabilities of the game.<P>I wonder if this thing isn't figured out in a few months if a blue name will give a real hint or maybe a starting step to get things moving.  I know they are all watching this thread, laughing because someone might say something close to what needs to be done but is off by just a bit so it doesn't seem to work.  But that fun will soon fade I'm sure and Verant will probably get impatient and want to see how we do with the plane, therefore giving out a secret or two.<P>Like many, I too wish I was able to be there just to see things.  Reading all this stuff just gets me all worked up and gives me a strange...Almost creepy yet mystified feeling.  I doubt that I would be able to figure anything out anymore than others but I have been known to have a strange way of thinking and sometimes surprise myself with the stuff I can come up with when Im faced with a puzzle. (Ive beat many of the Sierra puzzle type games like 'Kings Quest', 'Space Quest', 'Shadows of Darkness', and 'Castle of Dr. Brain'...They were always my favorite as a kid)  But, I know it will be a long time before my day to go to PoM comes and the puzzle will probably be long past solved since I am only level 31 atm and not a power gamer.<P>One question though.  How was the entrance to PoM so hard to find?  I remember when people were having the big discussions about how its probably not even on Velious if it existed at all or how it was in Siren's Grotto.  Looking at the map of ToV it seems to be in a somewhat obvious place.  I guess it's due to the fact that its so hard to get to.<P>Just my thoughts on what Ester said before about the current way to get to PoM not supposed to work...I think she just meant that it was intended to be a brute force effort to get there meaning you are supposed to fight your way to the entrance, as hard as it may be to do so.<P>Well, my blessings to everyone currently up there and any others planning to head up as well.  I hope you all are rewarded generously for your efforts and it turns out to be a good time.<P>Conann Cutenjolly<P>P.S.  I don't know anything about this because I have never used it personally but would a program such as ShowEQ be of any help up there?  I know it gets the hidden information that EQ sends/receives but don't know the extent of it.  This also may not be the way you would want to go about cracking the puzzle but if all else fails...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm wondering...you mentioned that the entrance was through ToV.  And that everyone seems to be KOS to the dragons there.  Perhaps it's RoS faction?  Anyone tested that?  Or, what's the only class that can worship Veeshan?  Bards.  Have you tried to get in with a Veeshan worshipping bard ?  <P>Also, has anyone used Identify on the cards?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
