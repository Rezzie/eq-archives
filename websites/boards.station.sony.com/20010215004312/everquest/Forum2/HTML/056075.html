I know, your first question is going to be, how did I decide to pick druids to be next? Well, honestly, it just came up in conversation today with a co-worker. There’s no trick to it. I would certainly address the ones most in need first, but until I’ve actually done all these posts, I won’t know which is most in need… (let’s not make that the topic of this post, please)<BR>So the question is, what is it that the druid community thinks they need to become a ‘balanced’ class? What is lacking? What is over-powered? - yes, that’s a valid question for any class –<P>This time I’m starting this post with very little information to lead with, so I feel like I’m at a bit of a disadvantage. I do know that, like many other classes, some druids feel that they don’t have enough to do while at the final encounter of the big raid. One of the suggestions to change that falls along the same lines as one proposed by the shaman community, changing/improving their healing abilities post 50.<P>I want you to understand that I think druids are pretty well balanced all around, and I really see little that needs to be changed (and that’s partially why I picked them to be the topic today…). So you’ll have to be convincing, logical and articulate to convince me. <P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> Well as you are going to target druids for your class balance as other think we are so powerful lets see.<P>wish list.<P>Some type of cannibilize type spell.<BR> Along lines of can 1 or wiz harvest, we are not most mana effecient class there is. Maybe something to cast that will slowly take health to mana. just a thought.<P>heal <BR> If your going to make it so we have to group then we do need better heal. It is a shame that a lvl 54 druid with 200 wis goes oom healing a lvl 45 warrior in a serious fight.<P>SoW 2<BR> think this for druids and shamans, not all of us like running around in wolf form for speed. I personaly hate being attacked all the time in this form.<P>charm animal<BR>Come on we are masters of the forest all animals should obey our wishes. As it is the spell is totaly no good. Most do not even bother getting them.<P>dd spells<BR>Now here is where we get embaressed, why in the world when you fight a mob a lvl 45 wizzie and 46 shaman out damage a lvl 54 druid. I mean total resisit to all spells cast on it, it being blue to me and red to them. Come on get real.<P>Some yell that our snare it too much, well they are not the ones in SoV areas like WL where it is resisted by 50 plus mobs almost 100% on first cast. How about some items for range slot for sruids. Most class have something that only they can equip that has stats that help them.<P>VI you want us in groups and dungeons fine make it so we have a place in these areas. Our best ae spells no good in there, our harmony is no good, heals will just barely keep someone alive long enough to get out. Our fire based spells are so resisted it is a joke, and the fizzle on heals are just mana holes. Unless grouped or helping newbies I don't even keep heal up. <P> well just some thoughts.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well i posted this at the end of of talk 5 but i dont think any one read it so here goes again.Im only a lvl 29 druid and i here that in high lvl raids druids are next to useless but iv got a way to fix that, because i dont want to waste all my time and hard work on somehting thats going ot be useless whats its gets to a high lvl.. I think something that would give druids a a good class defining ability is ot raise the cap to forage to like 250 ( 200 is forage limitit right now right?) Make forage a higher lvl skill like 39 34, somthign higher than it is, and once some one reaches a high lvlin forage be able to forage up one time use spellecial items that effects like dd's, dots, buffs, debuffs what ever. Having this ability to use htese items ina gorup or to any one would be great use on raid for higher. a example would be something like You have foraged something! "Ball of Nature" effect "slash of leaves". It would great to get a mana free dd or dot spell from a item that you could through away after use. it make them very valuable, if you thinks its not balanced enough make these items rare or no drop, or have a majority of the items you forage self only so it rsare to get somthing you can use on a group or somthing. Well i htinks its a good idea.<P><BR>lvl 29 druid<BR>bertoxx</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Please! Suggesting the impossible is not going to get us anywhere!<P>Due to global space contraints we will get no more unique transformations. <BR>That means no treant unless it's just a tree that can move.<P>No mana regen at low levels.  It's just not going to happen.  Druids are overpowered as soloers, and verant wants to make the game more group oriented.  Giving us spells that will make us solo better is just going to overpower us more in that area.  Druids get mana regen when they need it. at 50+.  Downtime is what makes a necro better at soloing than a druid.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Since it's a new thread, and most likely all absor will bother reading if he checks back, I'm going to repost my riposte of his summary. As well as riposte my summary.  My summary comes first. It was written before his summary.  My riposte of his summary was written after his ummary.  My summary first.I just thought I'd recap since this thread has fallen back a few pages and we've probably been forgotten.<BR>The druid class is fine (well overpowered is a more appropriate word) up until level 50. Up until level 50 is not a balance issue, merely a fun issue, or an issue of convienence. Post 50 it's a matter of group and raid viability. This is about the END GAME. We currently have no place (along with about 8 or 10 other classes) in the end game.<P>Pre-50 things:<P>Group EB/camo these were supposed to be in velious, got nix'd. Please sir, can I have some more?<P>Grove Form: Come on! gimmie gimmie gimmie! group root and tree illusion for 5hp/tick can't be overpowered. <P>Kunark evacs are a bother. Please remove the kunark dungeon requirement, there's a rut between the DL ring and karnors.<P>Ports to warsilik woods, greater fey, and surefall glade. The home of the druids SHOULD be portable. Who says you can't go home again?<P>Quests/Armor/Gear: There are virtually no druid quests. There is no mid range druid armor (other than fugly velious leathers, in your choice of tizmak, ulthork, and gnomeskin). There are very few druid specific items. What quests we do have require very rare, very valuable items to get medicore/useless items. <P>Post 50:<BR>More wolf forms. An indoor version with no speed boost would be nice. As well as group greater, and group form of the great wolf. How about Circle of the Seasons at 60? 50vs cold and fire in one buff? would be handy when buff slots are at a premium.<P>Treant form? I understand that trees weren't supposed to move so this could be a problem, but some of us do it anyway using the res bug. Remove root from Spirit of Oak, it's too rare anyway, not like any of us will see it.<P>Healing. We are a healing class. We can't. Reduce fizzles ALL ACROSS THE BOARD. Sup heal only gets so much attention because we use it most. We also need at least one efficient heal, and a fast heal would be nice.<P>Nukes/Dots: Don't give us better nukes/dots. Nukes/dots are pointless in the end game. Even if I wasn't 100% resisted I can't scratch an uber mob.<P>The pet: It's cute. But it's useless. How about an enchanter style pet or a dot pet? Both would make more sense per the name "Naturewalker's Behest" than a little baby bear that follows us around. Behest is an urgent request btw.<P>The epic: <BR>Fix feydedar! LISTEN! FIX THE FISH! I'm hearing reports of 300 and 400 hour camps only to have a guild KS! PLEASE make it a triggered spawn. The final fight for the cleric epic is triggered (Zordakilis&lt;sp&gt; ragefire) The rest of the epic is reasonable, but a 400 hour camp for a mob that will be ks'd is too long! Make it triggered PLEASE. Make a triggered version that *only* drops the orb if you like so you don't flood the game with dragon loot, but PLEASE FIX FEYDEDAR. Elaborate Scimitars are rotting in banks all across norrath because of a rare spawn, despawning, roaming into a guildmaster, dragon mob in a limited access zone that can't be ported to, or bound in. Make it as difficult as a kunark dragon if you have to, but FIX THE SPAWN.<BR>The epic effect: The dot is a joke. This is the end game remember? a 55 damage/tick dot w/ snare and a 50% resist rate Isn't balanced to other epics. Same for the necro epic. These effects help druids/necros solo better at a time that they NO LONGER SOLO. This is the end game remember?<P>Skin line:<BR>A&gt; Reduce the cost.<BR>B&gt; Add mana regen to SLN/NS<BR>C&gt; Make it stack with reso line.<BR>D&gt; All of the above.<P>Charm: Make mobs that SHOULD be animals animals. *cough*walruses*cough* Don't be picky about dinosaurs. Either they ARE animals, or they aren't. Fix the 55 charm. It doesn't clear agro. An animal only mez would be nice, but I'm not holding my breath. A dictatish animal only charm at 60 would be nice too. Stepping on chanter toes a little but considering the limited use i wouldn't see the problem. (we're not replacing an enchanter in a group any time soon anyway)<P>Egress/Succor:<BR>THEY DO NOT CLEAR AGRO!! FIX THIS! Succor sucks a ton of mana, kills it's usefulness. How about making it drain 2000 mana from the caster instead?<BR>Egress is odo. using half my mana to egress to zone out with succor in a linear dungeon is a waste.<P>Wake of Karana: <BR>A&gt; Lower the mana cost.<BR>B&gt; lose the reagent.<BR>C&gt; lose the reacst.<BR>D&gt; all of the above.<P>Blizzard/Rains in general:<BR>Look at the resist rate on rains please. With the rain nerf they're not much more mana efficient than regular nukes, and given the limited use (ae, damage over time, etc) they see almost no use. Fix the particles on druid rains. We get cold based rains. Hail and snow. But with a fire graphic. How about the frost spiral graphic from wizzies? would be more appropriate. Also, FIX THE PET+RAIN BUG! I traded for blizzard just so i could say "I have the spell verant refuses to fix the drop for" Once I got done playing with it, it went to the back of my spellbook with the other bad spells.<P>And finally. PLEASE look at the drop rate for many kunark spells. It's been nearly a year and the drops are still borked on many spells. Bane of Nife, Pox of Bertox, Tigir's Insects, Blizzard, RotG, spirit of oak, mask of the hunter (never have i seen a druid with this up), vocerate: water, these are just the ones I'm familiar with. I'm sure there are tons more.<P>Vocerate:Water dropped off of emperor chottal a couple of weeks ago. A 54 spell off of a mob that drops 59-60 spells. <P>----------------------<BR>Yeah, thats long. Next one is even longer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>And as threatened, a reposte of my response to the druid summary, I was mistaken this was not after the test changes like i thought.  But since the healing ideas he listed are effectivly what happened that doesn't really matter. Now on to the long post.<BR>This post is very long, but I'm sure if you read it you'll find something you can identify with.<P>Reading the whole thing is well worth it.As promised.... <BR>Found in the castersrealm archive<BR>my comments will be prefixed by a ###<BR>The druid summary!DRUIDS REPRESENT!, JANUARY 20, 2001 <BR>Source: EverQuest General Discussion Forums.<BR>First I want to ask you all to keep within the generally existing mechanics. We’re looking for balance, but I’m not going to bring a dozen new spell ideas to the team as a balance tool… And, realistically, we have to keep the ideas to things that won’t require a team of artists and programmers to create. <BR>Here’s what I’ve gleaned so far, filtered through my own ideas. <P>Healing: <P>Druids (and Shaman) want to be better at healing. Not only would this give them a more active roll at the end of the big raids, while at the same time reducing perceived ‘need’ for clerics at such times. But we also have to keep in mind that healing is the clerics role, and we do not want to infringe on that role. <P>So the proposal is this: <P>Move Superior Healing to 49th level. <BR>### Good idea. Comes way too late to be useful.<BR>### Would let 49-52 druids actually heal on <BR>### Dragon raids<BR>Add a new healing spell at 55th level. My suggestion so far is Remedy – a fast casting, low healing spell, and a solid upgrade from Superior Healing that won’t really infringe on the clerics power, which lies in big healing spells. <BR>### Problem. Our heals do approximatly 90% that<BR>### of clerics. (technicly theirs do 10% more <BR>### than ours). Remedy then does less than 400<BR>### at 60. Something like 398. We might as well<BR>### be using gheal to save casters. Please give<BR>### us the same 10% healing bonus. Clerics<BR>### already get a huge superiority in heals simply<BR>### Our heals doing less for the same mana is a <BR>### double whammy.<BR>Maybe add another healing spell at 60th level – perhaps Divine Light (though I’d rename it…) <BR>### Problem!!! This will NOT help! again we run <BR>### the same 10% less problem giving Divine Light<BR>### a ratio barely better than supheal. The<BR>### problem isn't keeping a tank alive. Most of<BR>### the time we can do that by chain healing. <BR>### The problem is that after we kept the tank<BR>### alive for that fight we're OOM. It's not<BR>### so much a problem of not being able to <BR>### Heal enough fast enough, It's more a problem<BR>### Of not being able to heal efficiently enough.<BR>### Some slow but efficient heal is needed. Like<BR>### 150/tick for 10 ticks for 350 mana. <BR>Reduce the fizzle rate on druid healing spells at the 50+ level. <BR>### This needs to go for ALL spells. Not just <BR>### Druid spells, not just healing spells. There<BR>### is a HUGE fizzle problem post 50. Look at it.<BR>More Quests: There have been repeated requests for more mid-level quests for druids. Though this isn’t really a class balance thing, I’ll keep it on this list. <BR>### There is no mid level armor for druids.<BR>### Quests would be nice, but I understand the <BR>### problem. It's the shiverback problem. <BR>### Unless you raise the ac of verm and ES so<BR>### there is a gap in AC between magical leather<BR>### and verm that druid quest armor can squeeze <BR>### into, you get armor that no one wears because<BR>### it has inferior stats, and/or ac to mundane<BR>### items. The Shiverback problem.<BR>Charm Animals: For a long time I’ve liked the idea of a druid being able to charm pets without making them angry. But this also has a ton of gameplay issues attached to it. Keep in mind that the main drawback to charm is that aggro factor. Taking it out would require some other serious drawbacks…<BR>### Yeah. Our level 55 charm spell was supposed to<BR>### do that. Level cap is 35. But it's not<BR>### supposed to agro. In my recent experience<BR>### it is not membluring mobs at all when charm<BR>### breaks.<BR>But I’ve also got that on my list. It should make for some interesting discussions. The idea of making them act like enchanter pets would certainly help. <BR>### It would also reduce the ability of druids to <BR>### use charm as crowd control. The only real use<BR>### that I've found at this time. If you want to<BR>### make a charm that makes a chanter style pet,<BR>### make the 55 charm spell permanent, and make<BR>### into an enchanter style pet. Though this<BR>### would allow me to solo very well in chardok<BR>### which wouldn't be good.<BR>A player then suggested: <P>How about a High level charm animal spell that only works on animals that con kindly or amiable. If the spell works, it says "The wooly mammoth decides to join you", if it fails it says "The wooly mammoth declines your offer".” <P>Right, something like that… <BR>### Shouldn't our charm already be like this?<BR>### And how about an upgrade to beguile plants?<BR>### I have never found a plant low enough to charm<P>New Druid Rings: I’m not likely to advocate placing new rings, those require redoing whole zones to get graphics in for them. But some of these ideas might be feasible (I’m not saying that they are good ideas, just feasible…): <BR>### The skyfire and ej evacs are evidence that<BR>### need nothing to bind a port to.<BR>### all we're asking for is Gfey, SFG, and WSW<BR>### three of the largest forests in the game.<BR>### I don't see a problem from an RP perspective<BR>### And there doesn't seem to be one from a <BR>### gameplay one.<BR>### And remove the dungeon only tag from kunark<BR>### evacs please. They're not used only as <BR>### intended anyway. We just run to karnors to<BR>### port.<BR>If we assume that trees themselves can work as foci for druid travel magics: <BR>### Voila! A roleplaying excuse. I believe you'll<BR>### find trees in all three places requested.<P>Surefall Glade <BR>Warslik Woods <BR>Greater Fay OR Lesser Fay <BR>### Those would be the three<BR>Form of the mouse! (I’m only slightly kidding, I like the idea). <BR>### How about brownie form? New animal models<BR>### aren't an option I thought. How about 90%<BR>### shrink and 70% speed increase. ZOOOM!<BR>Damage shield damage gets credited to the caster if more than 8 levels above the one being casted upon- same with mages. <BR>### Leave the shields as is, but limit the level<BR>### of allowable targets perhaps. That would<BR>### slow powerlevelers but still keep the caster<BR>### from becoming a quickly drying damp patch<BR>### on the forest floor.<BR>Actually, I’ve always wondered why this damage wasn’t always credited to the caster… I’ll ask. <BR>### Because we'd get murdered. You asked. <BR>### I answered.<BR>Any chance of treant form? <P>Hmmm… just a higher level version of tree form, that would come after wolf form, that is mobile… Interesting. <BR>### Models that weren't meant to move. Though I<BR>### don't see a huge problem with this other than<BR>### clogging tunnels. (remove root from spirit<BR>### of oak, add 56% snare. Add 50% shrink)<BR>Other new forms aren’t gonna fly (heh, good pun). As I’ve said before, I’d much rather advocate the use of any free space for giving enchanters more forms. <BR>### Yet mouse form got into the summary? How many<BR>### new forms have enchanters gotten lately? Oh<BR>### yeah. None..<BR>As for Spirit of Wolf - part II the revenge of the doggie: I’ll suggest it, but I don’t anticipate it happening, and I’m not one that would vote for it. <BR>### I agree. Bad idea. But how about making<BR>### scale and spirit of scale 115% movement<BR>### increase. As it is it is hardly worth<BR>### the vulnerability of SoS over SoW for a 10<BR>### or 15 percent increase in speed.<BR>Soloing: And, as a note, I’m not inclined to suggest improvements to the druids ability to solo. Keep in mind that we are encouraging grouping… <P>New looks: this isn’t a balance issue. But I’ll bring it up. I wouldn’t expect any new armor looks to come out as a result. Those kinds of things take a lot of resources to make. <BR>### You can do colored leather. Why not use the<BR>### gnomeskin.. er.. skin, but color it green?<BR>### or brown.<BR>Class specific armor is too heavy (Vermiculated): This is also something I can ask about. Heavier than warrior armor? <BR>### YES MUCH HEAVIER<BR>### When we complained last time we were told a <BR>### bunch of BS about our nifty weapons, and our<BR>### special qualities. (What special qualities)<BR>### That required our armor to be heavier than any<BR>### other.<BR>Elder Spiritist Boots: no component should be needed. <BR>### Or how about this. Change the effect to a<BR>### group lev spell? A level 14 spell on a non<BR>### hybrid armor piece? We're getting the short<BR>### end of the stick here..<BR>Faydedar: I’m pretty sure someone is looking into this beasty and his lifestyle. I’ll follow up on it. <BR>### PLEASE make this a triggered spawn!. No one<BR>### wants to spend the required 400 hours camping<BR>### him to have an uberguild ks it. The camp is<BR>### insane. <BR>Quad Kiting: My personal opinion is that the ability to do this should probably be reduced. I will probably suggest changes that have that effect. Though the only one I’ve seen (that wouldn’t also affect the rest of the gameplay for the class) that might work is to reduce the range on AoE spells… <BR>### Go on the test server absor, make a druid, gm<BR>### buff it to 54, go try and quad kite in burning<BR>### woods. See how time efficient it is over<BR>### methods.<BR>Absor later clarified that quad kiting would most likely not be nerfed, he just wished to bring it up with the rest of the issues. <BR>### Go ahead and nerf it. It's not good anyway.<P>NO LURES! Not gonna happen, I tells ya. <BR>### We need efficient heals, unique buffs<BR>### or unresistable magics to be useful in the<BR>### end game. Your choice.<BR>No resurrections either. I don’t see a need for it at all. <BR>### I get enough newbie beggers as it is. Let <BR>### clerics keep res. I don't want the hassle<BR>I admit that after about seven pages I started scanning instead of reading. <BR>### Which is why you missed alot of good posts, <BR>### commented on alot of bad ones, and saw the <BR>### majority of the flames. Not many flames left<BR>### by page four of part 5. Try it now, I'm told<BR>### *my* summaries are pretty good.<BR>But most of what I was seeing were repeats of the same requests. I consider that a good sign, really. But if I missed something that you don’t see above, let me know. <BR>### Been trying to let you know. You seem <BR>### unwilling to post again on the subject.<BR>### That or I can't get your attention.<BR>### Will continue bumping this with updates<BR>### until we get another response. I haven't<BR>### even gotten to what you MISSED yet.<BR>- Alan <P>------------------------<BR>End Absor text.<BR>God I'm too tired for this.<BR>BRB need caffeine to continue.<BR>Click. Pop. Fizz. Ahhhh.<BR>Where was I?<BR>Oh yes. The things you missed by skimming the last 50 pages or so. (Not trying to be *****y, but my carpal tunnels syndrom is acting up from all this posting)<P>Skin like WHATEVER:<BR>It costs too much. <BR>It doesn't stack with reso.<BR>Comes later in level than superior buffs from the Cleric class<P>Proposed changes. Feel free to pick any or all.<BR>A&gt; Make it signifigantly better than the reso line to justify the increaded mana cost, and the later level. (add mana regen to it, increase the hp/ac by 15%, something)<BR>B&gt; Make it stack with the reso line. Would make us stack better as a class with clerics. Would also give us something to offer to raids.<BR>C&gt; Lower the casting cost signifigantly. It currently costs almost 3 times as much for a druid to give the same hp buff as a cleric. At 49 and 57 we also bestow minor regeneration, but this is far from enough to make up for the huge mana cost.<P>Protection of the Glades.<BR>This spell is amazing. I love it. There is so much wrong with it but it is still a step in the right direction. My only request is.. In the early versions of this spell on test it bestowed 6hp/tick regen on the party. Then it was changed to 6mana/tick regen. This is currently the most expensive spell in the game. It is a dispellable buff that costs 1200 mana. Would it be horribly overpowered for it to give 6 mana AND 6 hp every tick? That would make it appealing to both the casters and the non hybrid melees in the group. We're talking about a level 60 DROPPED spell here. Would 6hp/tick in addition to 6 mana over balance the spell? I don't think it would. Given the level, the cost, and the difficulty in obtaining this spell I don't see a minor regeneration effect overpowering the spell. If you think it would please explain.<P>Spirit of Oak. Doesn't stack with PotG I've heard. Please change this. Also make it stack with mask of the hunter if it doesn't. This spell is EXTREMLY limited in use. It will be very difficult to overpower this spell. Anyone able to get on the jugg and dragon raids required to even obtain this spell isn't going to be abusing it with potg and mask of the hunter to solo.<P>Wolfform:<BR>Ok, we can't have new animal forms. Give us new wolf forms.<BR>Upgrades to SWF and WF. Including indoor castable versions WITHOUT a speed bonus, but perhaps a group wolf form with a high atk bonus (+100atk and ultravision at 60 perhaps.)<BR>Change Form of the Hunter. It gives +62atk. This is not an upgrade to Form of the Howler.<BR>Group tree form would also be nice. As well as being able to move around in spirit of oak, or in another new tree form spell.<P>Root: A version of root without damage would be nice. So we could root things for crowd control without getting summoned.<P>Ports:<BR>Change kunark ports to be not dungeon only.<BR>Change egress/succor to clear agro.<BR>Change egress to be outdoor castable<BR>Change the mana drain on succor (not as big a problem if you allow egress indoors, or make succor/egress clear agro. But as it is spending half of everyone's mana just to get back to the start of a linear dungeon frustrating)<BR>Check the "safe points" in zones. Many zone "safe points" are death traps. In chardok you land on the bridge where Cadeosaurs immediatly telekinesis you off.<BR>Mages get CoH at 56. Wizards get translocate at50.<BR>Wizards were told they couldn't have more ports because we were the masters of travel, yet we recieve no unique ports 50+. One suggestion was a group port to the druid's bind point. This could be overpowered. Make the side effects bad enough to counter this. (res effects, mana drain, reagent, whatever)<P>Fizzles:<BR>I mentioned it above. I'll mention it again. It is not just heals. I can think of 4 kunark druid spells 51-54 that have fizzle problems at 59. Circle of summer. Circle of winter. Sup heal. Breath of ro. I'm sure there are more. Other classes have these problems too.<P>Rains:<BR>Blizzard is worth a fortune because the drop rate is still broken (dropping like a level 60 spell, much like vocerate water). Having aquired it I really wish I could say it was worth the effort. Please adjust the resist rate and fix the pet bug. These spells have enough downsides without needing massive debuffing to hit, and without pets eating waves. Please change the spell graphic for druid rains. Our rains are cold based. They have a fire animation. The particles attached to the wizard frost spiral line would be more appropriate.<P>Group spells: Group eb and group camo didn't make the velious cut. Was there a gameplay problem? Group eb, group camo, and group lev would aid druids in being the masters of travel, as well as giving us something more to offer to a group. I also would like to see a Circle of the Seasons spell in the high 50's. +45 cold and fire in one buff. Would save buff slots, and save time without giving us the ability to do anything we couldn't already do.<P>Spell messages:<BR>This is more of an all class thing but... would it be possible to get a message when a buff wears off another player? Tanks never remember to tell you when a damage shield fades.<P>Group damage shields: They're later level, the cost more, and they have very limited use. Honestly, the only time I use these is when I'm secondary healer in a tank group in a raid and I don't want to chain cast a ds. And even then I usually don't bother. Since these are expensive and come at a later level would it be possible to have legacy of spikes raised to around 22, and legacy of thorns to around 30? That way not so much is lost when we opt for conveience over efficiency.<P>The epic weapon:<BR>Not just feydedar, though he needs changed. The effect isn't very good. The resist rate from reports I've heard is over 50%. The damage is negligable (55/tick, our level 44 dot does 64/tick). The Naturewalker's Scimitar, as well as the necro epic, help classes that are solo oriented pre 50 solo better at a level when they will no longer be soloing. Regrowth of the Grove would be nice on the druid epic. Since it does spit leaves, but at the very least look at damage of the dot, and the resist rate. <P>Armor: Elder spiritist is the same weight as other priest armor, despite having much less ac. If our armor is lighter protection shouldn't it be lighter weight? The effects on a few pieces of elder spiritist are rather low in level. No priest class other than us gets any spell lower than (i believe, correct me if I'm wrong, i'm too tired to double check) 34. We get a level 1 spell, a level 14 spell, and a level 19 spell on our gauntlets, boots, and helm respectivly. Our gauntlets and helm have the same effect as Tolan's. Is this appropriate?<BR>Rowyl's looks like tizmak. Verm looks like ivy etched, ES is barely discernable from verm/ivy. And rowyl's looks like tizmak. No unique looks at all. <BR>No PoG armor. I don't think we should have it. Since we are a good aligned class, BUT we should have access to similar armor to Rowyl's that is dropped at a rate and encounter difficulty similar to all other classes. (this goes for paladins and rangers too, they're also missing out).<P>Girdle of Karana: Someone mentioned that this is 11 levels higher for +7 strength. Not much of an increase there for quite a few levels, and WAY below shaman strength buffs. Perhaps upping it a little, while keeping it well below the best shaman strength buff. <BR>I would suggest making this item SUMMON a No drop Girdle of karana (a belt giving 0ac +42str) But that would step on magician toes. Kind of like mages getting a teleport did to us.<P>Raids: <BR>Don't think you mentioned this. But if you did, it needs mentioning again. We do not have a purpose on raids until 60. THEN we haver very limited purpose (Giving protection of the glades to the warriors and clerics who are the only ones who get to do the real work). <BR>Either we need a new ability that is useful on raids.<BR>We need access to an ability that makes another class useful on raids.<BR>We need a new version of a current spell line that will stick on uber mobs.<P><BR>Wake of Karana<BR>400 mana<BR>Reagant:Opal (consumed)<BR>Recast: 6 minutes<BR>To turn off the rain? Isn't that a little overboard for a cantrip effect?<P>Finally. Please put "Check drop rates of kunark spells" on the list. Many 54+ spells for many many classes are just too darn rare. So rare that most of us will never see them. I know VI doesn't consider spells a right but you have to make them available if you're going to use them as a basis for balancing classes. Don't say shamen are fine at 60 because they have torpor unless you're sure that enough torpor are dropping that your average shaman has a chance at getting it. Many spells are dropping from 2 places. Sebilite Juggernauts, and Kunark dragons. I personally don't have a stable enough connection to participate in a Kunark dragon raid. The shear numbers required simply do not allow it. My ping time jumps to about 18 seconds. Then I lag out. Should I be cut off from half of my dropped spells 58+ simply because I have analog phone lines? Yes they drop off of juggernauts, but rarely. And that's one camp. And don't suggest trading for these spells, I offered a Sarnak Battle Shield to someone LOOKING for a sarnak battle shield who had Regrowth of the Grove for trade. That's not even a particularly *good* spell, but I was turned down. Many spells are just too rare. So rare that most people will never get ahold of them, yet they are considered when a class is balanced.<P>This is the end because I'm not writing any more. I will continue to add, revise, and bump occasionally until absor gets back. Hopefully then he'll wonder why Druid talk is still up there when it was settled almost 2 weeks ago.<P>---------<BR>That's all.

</FONT><HR>Yes, I agree. Fix Feydedar.  If it's not broken, then change feydedar.  You cannot get feydedar without camping him.  He is rare and random and dies after 2 hours.   When you do decide to camp him everyone just leaves a mule on top of the spires and waits for it to get killed.  When it gets killed it means feydedar has spawned.  So they quickly log on their druid, float over and start kiting him around.  I've heard reports of as long as 400 hours. 400.  Then there's always the risk that before you get the people there another guild who had a mule sitting on the spires will get there and steal him.  He's a rare random spawn.  He's in a non bindable, non portable, limited access zone.  He's a dragon encounter requiring around 3 groups.  If not engaged within 2 hours of spawning he roams into the iksar master and dies.  <BR>Any one of these things would be appropriate, but all of them are not.<P>My suggestion. Put an npc in timorous that will "call feydedar" if you can "prove your loyalty to nature"  Hand npc your elaborate scimitar.  NPC hands back a "shimmeing elaborate scimitar" and change the end of the quest to require the shimmering scimitar instead of the regular one.  This would limite feydedar by the number of people who have gotten through the first 2 bottlenecks of the quest (jade reaver, and sathir stone)and not allow people to spawn fey repeatedly.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I think overall Druids are pretty powerful, we are not useful raid characters but I think the improvements to our healing abilities will help a lot.<P>I do think there are some issues with Druids that should atleast be looked at.<P>Issue #1 - Heavy Gear<BR>Rowyl's armor had it's weight reduced, but why not vermiculated and elder spiritists? Druid races have very low strength the weight on these items is beyond excessive. It's bad enough our armor has roughly one third the AC and worse stats than shaman/cleric armor, but does it really have to weigh more too?<P>Issue #2 - Lack of Items/Quests<BR>Druids seriously suffer from a lack of mid-level (and some ways, high level) items. Shamans have many +WIS spears available to them, while Druids have almost no +WIS scimitars. Clerics/Shamans have a lot of flexibility to what they can wear, Druids do not. We also suffer from low resistances (especially MR), due to item restrictions.<P>Issue #3 - Plane of Growth<BR>11/14 class specific armor is dropping here, why? Druids, Rangers, and Paladins are really getting shafted, I hope you realize this.<P>=================================================<P>Spell Issues:<P>Breath of Karana (LV56) - This is a very powerful direct damage spell, but, it is limited to outdoor uses only. Does there really need to be two resistance checks on this spell? It's already very limited in it's use, is the high resist rate necessary?<P>Exile Summoned (LV55) - Seems to me as though Mobs resist this spell as if it were a regular magic based nuke. Shouldn't the resistance check against this spell be lower? Seriously I was using this spell in the Hole not too long back and it was resisted so much I finally switched to Frost. I was getting a LOT of 100% resists off low blues (my druid is level60 btw).<P>Fire (LV49) - This spell is pretty stupid, highly resisted, worthless debuff, highly inefficient damage. I can't think of anyway to improve this spell, I honestly would just remove it.<P>Protection of the Glades (LV60) - Awesome, powerful spell. However the mana cost is 1200, that is, a LOT of mana. People in groups tend to die or get dispelled, the mana cost prevents this spell from being practical. Perhaps something along the lines of 750-950mana would be more reasonable?<P>Group Regeneration - Could we possibly have the duration of these spells lengthend? They have very high mana costs yet very short durations. They do not have a huge impact on groups, I would dare go as far as to say they are nearly worthless.<P>Wake of Karana (LV56) - Cool spell but why the expensive reagent and huge refresh time? Kind of silly for a spell that merely stops rain.<P>Spirit of Oak (LV59) - This spell is not stacking with Protection of the Glades. It is already limited to outdoors only, plus it roots you, they really should stack.<P>Spirit of Scale (LV53) - When a Mob casts on you, this spell will drop. You fixed Scale of Wolf so this would not occur but neglected to fix the group version of this spell.<P>Blizard (Lv54) - The resist rate on this spell is INSANE. I would have more luck hitting the lotto than seeing this spell hit for three waves. Also pet or no pet this spell seems to not want to hit for three waves. Another little annoyance is this spell always breaks root, i've tested this a lot, and every time root would break the second the first wave hit.<P>Tunares Request (LV55) - If you cast this spell on a mob too high level to be affected by it, the mob will agro on you. I'm not sure if is intended or not.<P>Nature Walkers Scimitar Effect - Resist rates seem to be really high, is this spell trying to make two resistance checks? I mean it is an 'epic' weapon right? I am seeing a lot of resists when using this weapon.<P>Succor - This spell is not clearing Agro, making it useless. What good is this spell if it just trains the dungeon on you? Or the mob just summons you back? This is an evac isn't it? It should clear Agro, period.<P>More Ports - We have no access to Surefall Glades or Greater Faydark, these are two Druid home points and yet we can not port there. Heck there is a druid ring right by Kelethin, can we please get access to it?<P>Group Damage Shields - Our single target shields are just about as good as Mages, yet our group shields are much much weaker than our single target. So much weaker, they are useless.<P>Skin like Nature Line - The mana cost on these spells should be reduced, perhaps reduce Natureskin to 300mana and work your way down from there. I mean we're talking a 400mana spell that's more or less the same as a Heroism which is only 120mana, and we have to wait like 5 post 50 levels for the spell.<BR> <BR>=================================================<P>Epic Quest Problems:<P>The Tainted Aqua Goblin in Lake Rathe doesn't seem to spawn his corrupted counter part very often, maybe I'm unlucky here but it took me many days of boring camping and five kills to get the corrupted mob to spawn.<P>The Tained Barracuda doesn't seem to like to spawn the corrupted version much either.<P>Faydedar is a joke, I personally got very lucky and happend to be in the right place at the right time for this encounter, but we've all heard the horror stories regarding this mob. A second computer and a mule should not a requirement to getting the Druid epic.<P>=================================================<P>This is totally off topic here but why is the Shaman bear form castable indoors? I mean this spell is vastly superior to wolf form, they can still have spirit of wolf active, and they can use it indoors? I hate to cry nerf here but honestly is this spell working as intended? I'm starting to see a lot of bears the size of two mac trucks in Sebilis lately.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>We get a spell that is supposed to be a non agro charm.  It's tunare's request.  It does however agro, at least some of the time (haven't done any testing really.. used it about 3 times when velious came out in wakening lands, animals weren't memblur'd any time, so i gave up.)  making the mob memblur'd on all druid charms could overpower it because you could easily recharm before they wandered away giving you a permanent pet.  Mobs are stronger than even magician pets.  If I could reliably keep a chokidai mangler charmed I would have a pet with something like 8khp, double 125 attacks, and of course, with my level 44 pet buff, I could keep it 70% hasted at the cost of only 100 mana every 10 minutes.  We would turn into uber-magicians in any zone with animal mobs.  This would make us better at soloing as well as unbalancing the whole game.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR> Come on we are druids we are supposed to have animals as friends and allies, remember we are one with nature. I for one think it is a bad thing that shamans have a bear form that has the stats it does. We get wolf form at 24 and more versions of it as we go up in lvl, but it does not work indoors. Yet a shaman all of the sudden gets bear form, get real they have a wolf pet where did the bear thing come from. They after all or called the wolfs of the north. <P> As for charm it is a joke, it sticks like butter on hot plate, along with lvl limit. About all used for is in low zones to get mobs like grim and have fun on greenies for a bit.<P> Now people call us overpowered hehe yeah right, necros kill a lot more effeciently than us. So do shamans if they one playing then know what they are doing. A good shaman can kill four ice gaints to me 2 easily, sure I could grab 3 of them and kite them. Using all my mana and hoping the dots kill them off, then sitting for 14 minutes to get mana back. All the while the shaman is using can 3 and killing away. We get a pet at lvl 55 hehe some pet, all it is good for is going to zones for faction adjustment on greenies, that is if you can get the spell. <P> Now quad kiting, lets see, you have to be able to go out and find 3 to 4 mobs of like movement rate. Then you have to ensnare each one, this involves haveing to keep one in range while you look for another. Then you have to circle a lot to get them together, most time have to let them tag you a bit to make sure all together. Then head in a good direction to get your ae of on them, and if you are lucky and good you use almost all yout mana for the kill. All this depends of course on the fact that a roaming mob does not jump you. Most times such as in  bw, you get them just about kill and a zealot or gullerback jumps you and you have to zone. So you lost all your mana and time, I do not know a lot of druids that do this. <P> In dungeons we are not very good, our heals suck and our downtime is so bad by the time they are ready to pull again we are still sitting trying to get mana. In a fight we run out of mana faster than most others and are resisited a lot more. So most times we are the fall back healer, we dot then pick a target and hope that the cast time and fizzle rate on our heals do not get the ones fighting killed. <P> It is not that we are overpowered it is just we figure out different ways to do things. Most will find an area that we can kill in with low danger to ourselves and stay there till no more exp. Now people say we can kite so well, hehe I found out how to kite 3 and 4 mobs from watching a wizzie do it. I found out how to fear kite and animal from a necro, I myself find fear kiting solo with no pet a mana hole. <P> So if you want us more group friendly, have our spells work indoors. <BR>If a shaman can have bear form with sow indoors then druids should be able to have wolf form same, we have been using it much longer. <P>Reduce mana cost and casting time of heals, along with the fizzle rates.<P>Have our buffs stack with other.<P>Make harmony work indoors for crowd control.<P>Give us some sort of mana regen indoors as the shamans have can 1,2 and 3.<P>It is not  that we don't want to group and help others, it is that we are not much use to them. <BR>I mean why should we want to go in a group and work our butt off to just watch them die. <P>VI you built us for the outdoors, you built us for solo. Now you decide it is not in your vision of what you want this class to be. hehe but I will tell you this a druid, a chanter and a warrior type are the most dangerous things in the game.<P>Well I vented have fun what ever you do to us, we will find ways to do our thing, we always have.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I can deal with all the other concerns peopple have brought up here except for Faydedar.  He is the last thing I need and I have over 400 hours of sitting in Tim Deep waiting for him.  The rest of the quest was rough.  Tainted gorilla spawned next to Severilious (sp?) and taunted me for a few days, Tainted goblin was killed 9 times before the Corrupted spawned and I can go on and on about the rest.  Not to mention all the VS raids I went on to get the stone (kudo's on making 2 drop tho).  Now I'm sitting in Tim Deep every night praying he's spawned and ready to cry when he doesn't, its just a sick joke to get this far and then get the shaft.  I can get the people (thanks to all my friends on BB) and would sacrifice levels to just finish this quest.  We, the druid community, are begging to haev Faydedar be a triggered spawn or have a new mob that only holds the druid epic piece, make the new mob the same level, have the same abilities but be triggered.  Make the trigger quest a large search for more IE tainted/corrupted type thing.  Clerics get a triggered uber mob, Rogues get a nightly spawn on and on, please please make Fay (or clone) triggered.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I only see a few minor problems with the class.  Lvl 50 and above druids are ok in a 6 man grp as far as damage shields, buffs, and dots or nukes.  The problem comes in on dragon raids and uber monstors.  Druids are very much useless, cept for buffs.  We can not keep up with heals and most of our spells will not even land.  I am talking about a 52 druid at Naggy, Vox, Servelious (sp?), Venril Sathir (needed for our epic), and trak.  I  know there are others, but the only thing we are useful here for are buffs, spells dont even land on these mobs or are resisted 95% of the time.<P>The other issue is teleports, we need something added in kunark and something around Qeynos hills or everfrost.  NK to permafrost is a long hike for anyone.<P>The last issue is melee, I know we are not a melee class, but doing any damage to finish off a mob would help and I can barely hit a mob or increase my skill for that matter at lvl 52.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Indoor harmony is NOT happening. I reapeat. NOT happening.  A druid should not have the ability to walk from zone in to trakanon in a full spawn dungeon with the use of a single spell!  Sure this is probably an exageration, since some mobs are immune (and don't give a failure notice) but it would still be enough to let us completly replace a chanter for crowd control in 90% of the post 50 game.  <P>The pet is supposed to be bad.  It is a token pet. It exists to say "druids are the masters of all things natural, an animal follows them around".  Charm does not suck, it is situational, but it does what is intended of it in the situations where it can be used.  Use charm in a group in chardok as secondary crowd control sometime and you'll see what I mean.  I guess the only really useful charm spell is the level 52 charm, and it is situational, but charm was not meant as a way to give us a pet.  <P>Mana regen is not going to happen any sooner than we already get it.  However much it would augment our group friendlines, it would augment our solo ability more.  Verant does not want to make us better soloers, we don't need to be better soloers, we are already very powerful soloers, and if not overpowered at soloing, than very close to that line.<P>Epic effect does suck.  It helps a group that is solo oriented at low levels solo better at a level when they will no longer be soloing.  Much like the necro epic quest.  The quest needs work, feydedar is insane.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I'm a 22 druid, so I have no experience with dungeon raids or the like, but there is one small thing that irritates me:<P>Please make all animals subject to the charm/fear/sense animal line.  Spiders in BB or any aracnid for that matter fall in to the animal kingdom.  Another post earlier mention walruses (sp?).  Any way, that is my thought on the matter.<P>Also, perhaps a minor improvement in the healing family of spells would help as well.  In some situations, we're the only healers around and it kills us to keep up the healing.<P>Thanx, <P>Ainolas Windwalkr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You want us to group do you?<BR>Well give us more group spells, not just at higher levels but after about 14th (when soloing because easy).<BR>I think its fine if you do not want us to be the healers, DD’ers, or DoT’ers but give us something that makes us wanted in a group.  I solo because I find its rather hard to find a group that wants a druid and if I do I feel like I have little to offer.  If we had group spells starting earlier we might just spend more time grouping from a lower level, not many will go soloing from 14 to 50 and all of a sudden say “I should group now” and even if they did who wants a (group) beginner in there 50 plus group?<P>P.S. If you want us indoors give us something that works indoors<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is a class balance observation between cleric and druid:  <P>Problem: At the higher lvls Clerics have to heal, and druids arent very good healers. <P>Solution: Add a little bit of healing to druids, and a little bit if Unique offense to clerics.<P>I think a druid, with nature in his realm, should get superior healing a bit earlier(51 is fine) or give us a special lvl 51 Healing DoT so its not instant but still is mana efficient(maybe over 6 ticks).<P>Clerics should get a new line of attack spells, power words(direct channeling of the voice of their god).  Power words have super fast casting times and 30-60 sec recharge times, and are not as mana efficient as other classes with similar abilites, but they can cast them faster and possibly with less resist(being from their god).<BR>  <BR>Power words(single target):<BR>Stun  (as normal stun)<BR>Sleep  (as mezz)<BR>Flee  (as fear)<BR>Kill   (DD with Stun)<P>Clerics deserve more of a combat option to make them more exciting and less utilitarian(Boring), and druids should be able to take on the healer role a bit better to make it easier on the cleric to throw some attacks.<P>As a druid, I never use my heal spells unless Im in a group so I dont think increasing their use will imbalance the druid, it just might make em more group worthy.  Heck if you dont give us better healing, at least give the power words to the clerics. Currenly you must probably be a very boring person to play a cleric(hopefully not, but your very patient at the least).  <P>-Radagorn,<BR>45 Druid<P>P.S. By the very short attention seemingly put by Verant on Druid talks(this thread) give me the impression that it was a token attempt and Verant has no intention of doing anything with druids short of adding stuff to sell future expansions, which is fine. I just wish they said that out right and not even open the thread on druids. I find it disrespectful to the players(adults play this game too Verant).  <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hello People.<P>I play a druid myself, I just recently hit level 46.<BR>I enjoy playing a druid both solo, and in groups.  Have not noticed too many picky groups which would not want a druid (unless if they already have one). <P>From what little I know about druids (not having played in the post 50 lvl game) ..<BR>I DO know a few things could be improved upon, without hindering or upsetting a whole lot of people.<BR>1) charm line of spells... either remove it all together or fix them please<BR>ill bet more druids died in hopes of 'charming' a pet and having some sort of a defense, than having a charm last longer than 10-30 seconds.<BR>totally disappointing to say the least<BR>2) improved sow.. self only perhaps? 39th level somewhere? <BR>3) teleport point to somewhere *near* everfrost... NK is definately not near ;P<BR>4) a lot of spells that should work in doors .. do not <BR>5) a lot of animals ... are not<BR>6) skin line of spells could really use a mana downgrade ;P and having them stack with cleric buffs would be a bonus (hate wasting mana only to find out someone has been pre-buffed with a cleric.. just a waste)<P>so there :P<P>sili</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi, I'm not sure if your taking anymore input, or if this has been stated before, but could you guys also look into/re-evaluate the drop rate on vermiculated armor in PoF?  Currently every fear raid I've been on (in guild or out) has at least 4 druids, usually more like 6.  With this many druids, and the average of 1 drop per raid doesn't leave much reward verse the risk (1 drop / raid seems to be the average I've seen over the MANY raids I've been to).  Maybe I'm just walking bad luck...  <P>Also, I'd like to see the armors spread out between the planes (at least for PoF, PoH) giving certain classes more incentive to goto their "oppisite" plane (ie.  druids to hate, cleric to fear).<P>Thanks for listening</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Travian, <BR>Before you go sounding pulling the "NERF" fire alarm like many before you have, you need to look into the facts.<P>1) Druids don't get a pet until Level 55.<BR>2) The Lvl 55 Druid pet is Level 28-30<P>My weak arrse bear pet couldn't even solo "a ghoul" in South Ro without sustaining MORE THAN HALF its life in damage. The pet is a joke. It has no usefulness whatsoever, other than showing off.<BR>"Oh Look!!  A Tiny Bear! How cute! That's so cool!"<P>The Druid class has become more and more increasingly frustrating to play with every level increase because of people yelling and complaining that druids are "overpowered", "need to be nerfed", "are nothing but a bunch of kiters" ...when in reality, WE CAN'T FIND GROUPS, no one wants us, because we've been NERFED SO MUCH.<P>For many druids, to make up experience for the lost time searching for dang groups, we're forced to solo and Quad-Kite. To take that ability away, will probably force many druids to quit the game altogether.<P>Its so hard to find groups because Druids 49+ get their spells resisted 40-75% of the time in dungeons and raids when there are actually blue-con mobs around. We sometimes burn 1-2 bubbles of mana fizzling Superior Heal trying to get just ONE successful cast off. So put all of this together with the huge casting time, and intense lag, you end up with dead, frustrated, or angry party members because heal wouldn't pull off in time.<P>I'm sorry, but I just can't see any arguement in nerfing druids any further beyond what they already are. Druids totally suck at all the things that would really matter during end-of-game group-play.<P>Maybe the only things I could see that could change this are (in order of importance):<P>1) Superior Heal fizzle rates lowered substantially.<P>2) Overall spell (Scoriae, Frost, SNARE) magic-resist-rates lowered, but not to the point where they step on any wizard toes. (not interfering with the usefulness of lures)<P>3) Pets and other group members effecting Rain Spell Waves  (take the pets and other players out of the equation so the waves don't drop from 3 waves to 2) as in the case with at least Blizzard.<P>4) Decreasing the weight on Vermiculated and Elder Spiritist Armor. (Even with an Evil Eye Bag, Light-Burlap Sack, Dusty-Ransack, and Archeologists Bag,  I find myself overweighted most of the time if I have ANY additional loot on me, even after Storm Strength)<P>Billybonez<BR>Level 56 Preserver (July 1999)<BR>The Rathe<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056075-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056075-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056075-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056075-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056075-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056075&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056075&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
