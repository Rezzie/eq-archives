Consider that to be a huge xp penalty.  <P>Clerics CH'ing without risk of getting hit was just stupid in the first place.   Give the changes time and change your tactics.

</FONT><HR>Grimsnemesis, for your information, my main character is a Phantamist so I know what I'm saying, but do you?<P>Differences between the enchanter aggro and cleric aggro:<P>1) Out biggest taunt used to be the tas line, but unless you'r very cofident, you won't cast the winds line of tas. You cast the single target line. Clerics aggro, however, is AoE aggro with huge aggro radius.<P>2) When the puller in group pulls multiple mobs in. Unless you're confident, you would be using dazzle rather than fascination. Target and mes one by one rather than AoE mes and get everything on you. For cleric's case, please see point 1.<P>3) When enchanters is doing their job, they have clerics on their back (after 53, I never leaves home without a cleric, you?) making sure resisted mobs will be stun, wounds would be healed. Now, who is going to back clerics up?<P>4) If things go wrong, enchanters have the colors line to buy some time for heals. What do clerics have? A DA spell will won't be refresh for a long time and while under DA, back up healers can't heal us.<P>5) Most important is when enchanters died, they have the clerics to res and group don't need to evac. Downtime is reduced to the minimum and most of the enchanter's lost exp can be recovered. Now what if the cleric died in the middle of a dungeon. You and the rest of the group gonna stay and wait for the cleric to run back down to your camp spot and res himself? You going to stay in the middle of the dungeon without a cleric?<P>Enchanters and Clerics are supposed to be best friends and best complementory partners. Just sad when some of our fellow enchanters can't see that.<P><BR>Atropo Fateweaver<BR>Phantamist of Xegony<BR>Artemi Fategranter<BR>Templar of Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The main problem is that all boss type mobs have 100% MR (this I never will understand why give us spells when we not can use them). So the only why take them down is to bet them down with tanks. And when them are hiting 512 or more per hit. Then you most CH is the tank shall last more then a 10 sec. But now that can't be done any more. <BR>They have failed with Scars of Velious caster post 50 are not wellcome (they can do any good anyway almost all mobbs are 100% MR) So it is tank healer world. And now they try to stop that.<P>Fix the problem with MR insted so caster can be used insted to do the simpel way by nerfing.<BR>The reason there are so much higher MR is not the nukes. It's they don't like Chanters mezz- It's to powerful.<BR>If they wasen't 100% MR then we can work around hate nerf by stun or root. <BR>But now if a mob at 60 plus get his mind on killing a cleric it no way he can be stoped from do that. And when all clerics is dead then raid is over and 1 to 2 hours cr will take place.<BR>When you done that 2 or 3 times then clrreics don't want to go deep anymore. And you are back to zone line camping in Scars of Velious. <BR>Or back to kurnark the mobbs don't hit that hard and spellcasters spells will land.<P>/mage lvl 55<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'll step in here... if you've never been to the Temple of Veeshan, then you have ZERO ground to stand on. <P>I would LOVE to hear your tactics for a 2-3 drake pull in ToV with current heal aggro. It's beyond nuts - I am quite easily the best equipped warrior in all of everquest across any server. I COULD NOT TAUNT a single damned mob for the life of me ... you want to see what a ridiculous picture I took?<P>Was a two drake pull, one drake pulled to side to be tanked by myself, other drake gang banged by fight teams. First, let me give you a little background on these drakes. They have over 50k hps each. They are between level 60 and 62. They can range from Warrior, Cleric, Shadowknigt, Druid, Rogue. Each has a unique AOE, all being extremely nasty dots, some draining mana at an incredible rate, all being hard to resist. Back to my story - so I'm tanking a drake, the kill team on other drake. I have already done quite a bit of damage to this drake, on top of that I have proced Maelstorm 5 times and Froglok Poison 3 times (These are VP weapons for the uneducated that have as high as taunt as you can get on a weapon atm). A cleric casts a heal on me, mob turns on cleric, I'm still on mob, druid heals cleric, cleric DAs, mob turns to druid, other cleric heals druid, mob turns on cleric, all the while I'm hitting this mob with everything I have already having taken a mob with 50k hps down about 8,000hps, he's still on the healers. Cleric 2 dies, Druid 1 dies, Cleric 1 rips off DB. Other mob dead, Drake 2 frenzies on every other healer. What do I do? I sit down... yep, you heard me.. I sat down. After planting about 9k damage on this mob, I just planted my ass down, didnt turn on me once.. didnt even look my direction. I could have sat there and medded to full mana if I wasn't a warrior.<P>This game is beyond broken... Convince me otherwise  - you can't... I can only guarantee this will be changed/fixed the next patch.<P>After trying everything to keep the healers alive, the only viable solution became to bind right outside ToV entrance and gate out once super aggrod on,,, the game in its current incarnation basically sucks. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The dont know your class dribble is mostly nonsense. Doesn't matter how well you know your class in these encounters. Healers are left with a choice. Heal the tanks and die. Or dont heal the tanks then the tanks die. <P>End game encounters are currently summed up easily as follows... Heals are required at a quick enough rate such that no form of tank can keep up with aggro caused by those heals.  <P>This is not fun, it blows the purpose of the classes and adds to down time. <P>What is left is stupid work arounds like the gate tactic mentioned above or just encounters with very little healing. Fun fun fun lets rush in all melees, have them die, rez them in with rez sticks. Repeast as necessary. Where the hell is the strategy in that? So silly. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Fighting anything with an AoE type spell is very bad for the cleric now. We were doing an icy servant in SG (pretty nasty mob, 2 or 3x for 310, and a AE DD for about 700), so the cleric can just use Celestial anymore, need to heal people fast. So, cleric heals the tank, cleric is now dead. I tried chain tashin, cripple, a dd, etc, and nada (im a chanter). <P>We managed to live (all but the cleric), but i cannot see how a cleric isnt going to die on every single high lvl fight when there are only 6 people around. Especially when that cleric has to deal with AE spells etc.<P>I like how certain chanter spells now seem to have a lower agro, but to be honest with you, i'd rather have my old agro back and the clerics back to where they were. At least that way we stood a CHANCE at all of us living.<P>Oh and btw, remember that nasty icy servant? Phat lewt yall, the rare and almost unimaginable...<P>GOLDEN EARRING!!!!<P>Risk vs Reward....<P>OH YA!<P>Dont like the sarcasim? Then TEST your stuff before making rash decisions in order to "fix" something. Hell, with this new agro you can easily put back the old Donal BP the way it was, CH is a death wish, worse than tash ever was. <P>We are PAYING for you to deliver a product, please stop with the "well the test server only has X # of people" We pay for a product not to be testers.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Saying FoH don't know their classes or the game is obviously stupid. They are one of the guilds that developed many of the strategies for fighting different mobs. They've killed things most of us don't even know about, and they did it without the benefit of reading someone else's notes on how it was done. Also, since Furor posted and didn't say the 53 cleric was lying, I'd say it's rather obvious he's a member of FoH. 53 seems low, but he's a cleric. Maybe after the patch they're having to use more, who knows. Maybe he's got a lv 59 hybrid or a caster, and figured he'd be useless, so came with his twink. Who knows, who cares. Doesn't change the fact his story seems to be accurate.<P>shazariahl, 57 wizard of 7th hammer.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>Eduin you just don't know what you're talking about, have you ever set foot in ToV ?<P>What Furor is talking about is YARD TRASH. ToV is crawling with those 60-62 drakes, all packed on top of one another to boot, with a solid mix of roamers and fixed spawns. And you have to go thro this to get a nib at even hard stuff, like wurms, that are even harder, and simply look like fire beetles compared to the named ones there.<P>So basically you're saying it's normal to have 30-40 people die every pull of yard trash. Well when your guild and you have worked up their butts for months over months to go to those places and take on the hardest challenges the game still has to offer, they still expect to have FUN, and score a few successes. What you don't get in the picture here is that they're not ToV noobs, they've been there numerous times already and basically it means they can't go beyond the 1st hall without doing multiple CRs or relying on cheesy gating tactics. You can't compare that stuff with your own limited experience, which, from what I gathered, stops at farming PoG. Funny we don't hear enough about your own tactics in those places, eh ?<P>Point is, the high level game is currently broken, whatever you drivel about here on this board, because the basic group structure warrior/cleric all the raids had to depend on so far has been negated with the Taunt and Heal agro fixes. It sure balances classes out, since now it's pretty guaranteed everyone dies in the high level areas. Mobs there now reign supreme, and what is left for "uber guilds", as you so like to call them in a derisive manner, is farm the lower risk areas or quit playing the game.<P>For all the perceived arrogance in their posts, they want to keep playing it as much as everyone who pays for the game does, and currently the highest level EQ areas are really not enticing to do so.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>Eduin you are so clueless I almost feel sorry for you.<P>It's not all about Furor here, despite what you want us to believe, it's about the basic principles of the game that are totally out of whack in the high level game.<P>Basically you're saying that healers shouldn't be healing the tanks when fighting big mobs. What are they supposed to do then ? Summon food and save mana for the resses ? Where is the idea of fun there ? You also forget to mention that by not healing the main tank and letting him die, you have to repeat the process with another, then another, and possibly more depending on the difficulty of the mob. Your idea also totally discounts the AE that will damage more than just the tank, to boot. What's going to heal that damage without agro ?<P>At all levels when multiple persons or groups are involved in a fight, the basic roles are defined as the mob damage absorbers, the mob damage healers, and the ones who will deal the damage to the mob. Remove any factor in this equation, or render them useless, and there's little to no chance of success overall.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Eduin, shoosh. Please. <P>What's funny is maybe this is the way VI has decided to make intel casters viable in the high end SoV encounters -- make the cleric/tank combo useless as well! That way we're *all* frustrated.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">Ahh, the wisdom!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062398-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062398-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062398-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062398-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/062398-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=062398&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=062398&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
