</FONT><HR>Is irritating. Your logic for wanting it nerfed is faulty.<P>You say, "But we should be very careful when we give the more class defining abilities to other classes. The ability to look like a werewolf is the signature illusion for enchanters. Even if we don’t remove this lute, we most certainly should think twice before giving such abilities to classes in the future."<P>In that case, please take a look at removing all Warrior/Monk/Rogue items that cast spells.<P>Furthermore, Monks have BARD songs on a couple of thier items. That detracts from the signature spell casting style of the bard, and should be high on your list of nerfing...<P>Bards have always had a tie to werewolves. At least from the information in the game that points to Mayong Mistmore.<P>Mynthi Davissi is a named Gypsy in Mistmore. She spawns as a werewolf at night. This was because of a curse laid upon her by Mayong. (Maybe someone else can shed some light as to why this was done exactly. My information is a bit sketchy about the why.)<P>There was a GM event that involved a bard that went around telling other bards a story. (I only know that it involved Mayong Mistmore, so yet another tie)<P>Bards doing thier newbie mail quests take hits against Mayong. No other class specific quest results in a hit against Mayong.<P>There are other signs out there that I have read about, but not seen. Maybe other bards can come here, and help me in defending a lute that I don't even own as of yet, but wish to be able to in the future.<P>Please remove this nerf you have planned from your list. I don't want to see it again.<P>If you are balancing us, (And the lute is HARDLY a balance issue. Then please, be fair about it, and remove spell effects from all non-casting classes items.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Yes, perhaps a clarification...<P>Lute of the Howler is a Bard only instrument that allows us to turn into werewolves.<P>Absor has used it as a "Possible Nerf" in the name of "Balance".<P>My thoughts are that he hates the item, and has a vendetta against it for some odd reason. (Plays an Enchanter and thinks it takes away his uniqueness?)<P>Anyway, his only defence of putting it on our "Balance" list is that it takes away from a core ability of a class.<P>I then ask why do Monks get a Bard song (Which is a unique method of casting in and of itself, and a core ability.) Why do Rogues/Monks/Warriors get ANY spells whatsoever? That is absolutly a core class ability.<P>His second argument is about there being no "Story" for bards to have ties with Werewolves. Which there is plenty of ingame content to suggest otherwise...<P>I merely want to see the lute removed as a "Balance" item when it does NOTHING to balance the bard class, and is simply a spiteful nerf in the making.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This type of thing is the reason why I don't think that Absor should be making decisions as to what is brought to the Development team to be looked at.  He just doesn't get it sometimes.  His "vision" obviously doesn't mesh with Verant's "vision".  If it did then there wouldn't be all the cross-class items/spells/songs/abilities in the game. They already exist.  The fact that he is focusing on one small item is mind boggling there.  His vison of enchanters is WAY off as well.  You wonder if he has ever dealt with them in a group in this game.  If you look through his posts for the "class balancing" issues, you can probably figure out the large number of classes he has never played and rarely grouped with.<P>Another misconception he has/had was the fact that he thought that because no one else was the master of throwing, monks "might as well be."  Last time I looked there was a high level 50s (maybe even level 60, not sure of the level) discipline for rogues called "Assassination" that pretty much makes rogues the masters of throwing.<P>If you went through his comments in just about all of the threads you could pick out similar problems.  I sure hope that it's true that the rest of the team took the time to actually read all the posts for themselves.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hm...<P>How many of the people on this read only what Absor said in the bard thread, but not in the enchanter thread?<P>He has said that perhaps in the future they should consider the outcry about this item when creating new items, but has never promised to do anything other than bring it to the team... and that's because of tons of whining from the enchanters.  I think he brought it up in our thread by way of a heads-up, and maybe hoping that we would give him something he could take to the enchanters to pacify them.

</FONT><HR>Absor doesn't have a vendetta against any class.  He simply feels that classes should have things that make them unique.  <P>Many of the 'unique' things were taken away prior to Absor's employment with Verant, so you can't blame him for all the casting armor out there.<P>Personally, I think the only way to make things interesting at the higher levels is to give magic items with interesting effects for *all* classes, though I admit 'class defining' abilities shouldn't be the ones put on items. So in other words, most of the casting armor is fine with me.<P>On the other hand, the association between bards, Mistmoore and werewolves has long interested me, and I do like the way the effect on this instrument ties into the implied story.<P>A possible compromise:<BR>The Musicians in Mistmoore only become werewolves at night - change the effect on the lute so it only works during the nighttime.  If you could dynamically determine duration so as to end at sunrise, all the better.<P>Personally, I would rather see this item drop as some kind of quest instead of being found where it is.  If not, tie Mistmoore into the Grotto, or tie the sirens into Mistmoore somehow.  It always bugs me that such great opprotunities for story depth are missed by the game designers.<P>Mike<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>While I understand Absor's point about maintaining a seperation in class abilities, I think he has used somewhat faulty logic. Lets look at the whole necromancer/enchanter illusion issue: now illusions are an enchanters domain and all things undead are a necromancers domain, so shouldn't an undead be both of theirs? I mean it falls undeniably under illusions, but certienly could fall under ALL things undead. So really its pretty obvious that both should get it really but Absor seems to have aritrailly choosen this to be necromancer turf which really causes me to scratch my head.<P>As for the enchanter stealing the mana boost capabilities, its fairly obvious that any change made that early should not be considered stealing an ability. Although songs on equipment should certienly be considered as theft, just like spells on items.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Turanod,<P>Problem is that Bards already "Steal" from just about every class in the game. Most obvious from Rogues/Enchanters.<P>So what is the problem with us having abilities only allowed to our Main classes?<P>We were given illusions in the form of items.<BR>We were given mez ability in the form of songs.<P>There is no difference. Yet there is noone screaming that Crowd Control should be enchanter only. Only illusions. I don't see the point.<P>Why try to get something nerfed because it shares an ability you have with another class. Especially since this (IMO) is NOT a class defining ability to Enchanters...<P>Necromancers and Enchanters both had illusions when the game came out. Necromancers just had to wait because thiers was broken.<P>Bards and Rogues also later found the first of the illusion giving items.<P>There should be NO reason to take away the lute.<P>It's like Mages/Necro's complaining that Wizards/Druids/Shaman get pets...it just doesn't work that way.<P>Bards are still very limited as to illusions compared to Enchanters. I also agree that Enchanters should get more illusions. Why would anyone want to take an illusion from another class? Especially when talking about "Balance"?<P>If anything it should have been a totally separate thread. It has NOTHING to do with Balance. It does not reduce/increase the effectiveness of a Bard if he is in the form of a Werewolf. Why is it even an issue there?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;Then give us back the clarity that only Bards had...<P>&gt;&gt;If you don't want to share, I sure don't....<P>Sorry, but they don't compare.  Clarity was added for balance reasons.  The lute wasn't.  Additionally, quite a few other songs have been added to bards after release that duplicate other classes.  Whining along that line isn't a road you want to walk.<P>Additionally, I'd like to see clarity handed out to a few more classes so as to help reduce people's "must have" view of enchanters.<P>It's all simple.<P>They have told us that werewolf was given to enchanters as a unique look.  The game was originally intended to have lycanthropy, which is why it was in the global file.  So they threw in the look for enchanters because it would be cool.  They gave necro's and shamans unique looks and told us we can't have them (which I agree with).  And for that reason, bards should keep their hands off ours.<P>I would like them to give it its own unique look.  Something just for bards.  Same stat and haste bonuses.  Just your own unique look, one enchanters aren't allowed to touch.<P>Everyone comes out ahead that way.  You've got your look, we've got ours, and you still have all the stat bonuses and a nice lute.  The way it should be.<P>The item was a mistake, it should never have been made as it was.  So now we should find a good solution that doesn't cost anyone anything while correcting the mistake.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Lute of the Howler is not my primary concern, it's more of an example.  I don't think that there should be items that grant out of class abilities, unless they are there for a specific reason.  It may very well be that the Lute is just such an item.  But I also don't like Invis on a warrior item, healing on mage items, direct damage on cleric items, summoning on bard items...<P>The Lute strikes a cord with me because the Werewolf form is probably THE signature form for enchanter, and giving it away seems wrong.  Now I've heard there is an in-game story behind this that would favor its inclusion, and that's great.  But that doesn't change my objection to the principle of giving powers from outside of the class, and especially signature powers, via items.<P>Alan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I think alot of arguement would insue initally, but if the design team where to actually say why you choose what you choose, like the illusion thing it would at least give us all a basis for reasonable and rational debate instead of the mudslinging that tends to occur.

</FONT><HR>Turanod:<P>Well, in the case of the whole Necro/Enchanter and undead thing, that's a lot like the chicken and the egg.  I don't know which came first, nor, perhaps, which should have claim on it.  But my thoughts on it are pretty simple.  IF necromancers are going to be able to turn into anything at all, it's going to be undead.  So if we were take that away from them, they will lose the ability to turn into anything at all.  So it's more reasonable to take it away from enchanters.<P>That's my thought at least, certainly not company policy or any reflection on the intent of the dev team.<P>And I feel that it is important that we resist the urge to continue to spread out the class abilities, especially through items, since items seem to be the easiest way to do this.<P>The Lute came to my attention during these talks.  There are certainly other items that I think spread class abilities too far.<P>But, once again, those are my thoughts, not representative of the company, or the team.<P>Alan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

We also pick up most of our abilities from Rogues/Enchanters. I would expect us to overlap in abilities. Including Illusions.<P>Thank you for seeing that there is a story involved with werewolf illusions.

Who said classes were supposed to have unique abilities?  It's quite the opposite in fact.  The nature of the hybrid is to share abilities yet to not be as effective at them.  Yet each pure class, especially pure casters, specialize in different things and do them better than any other class.  A difficult to attain item with an illusion effect hardly makes the enchanter class less attractive to a group.  If your selling point to get groups is a werewolf illusion perhaps you suck as an enchanter?  And if you did group with a bard who had this lute how would that make you less effective?<P>Again, I fail to see the point of your question.

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;name ONE thing that Enchanters are reknown for, and are the ONLY class that can accomplish this signature feat&lt;&lt;<P>Oh lord, that line again.<P>I think the reason Enchanters use that line so much is because they are used to having a stack of unique abilities.  No other class ever had that, and now the Enchanter has been diluted a bit.<P>They are still the only class that can enchant metals (even the Giant Fire Beetle eye was nerfed).  They have far and away the best hastes (only class in game that can bring someone without a haste item to the haste cap).<P>They can get into any city in the game if they are agnostic (I agree the religion issue is screwed up), plus they get almost every utility spell in the game but one or two.<P>And of course, the best crowd control, an ability so unique that Verant had to totally overpower the latest expansion mobs in order to prevent Enchatners from being necessary without making battles far too easy with them around.<P>Mike</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058397-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058397-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058397-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=058397&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=058397&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
