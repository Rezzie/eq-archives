</FONT><HR>What is there to say about warriors?<P>The idea of this thread is to talk about how to balance the warrior class in the game of EverQuest.  I must admit that I don't really expect to see too many suggestions.  The warrior seems to be a well balanced class.  And we have to keep in mind that the warrior is a sort of staple class, upon which the relative balance of several other classes hinges directly.<P>So this is the forum to talk about what is right and what is wrong with warriors.  Go ahead and tell me about bugs you've seen too.  I'm not focusing on them, I'm concentrating on class balance here.  But I will  also take note of non-balance concerns as well.<P>Have at it, muscle-bound-types.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>An AE melee attack sounds like a great idea to me. A warrior should be able to hit more than one thing at a time with his weapon. Make it a high level skill, like around level 40 or 45. It should work like kick, where you can push the button and it'll work once and you have to wait for it to refresh. Warriors are quite balanced though as they are, but an addition like that would be great.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Warriors are, as they now stand, a fairly balanced class.  They are not, however, perfect. . . and this is our goal, right? J<P>The biggest issue I see facing the warrior class at this point is Taunt.  The "role" of a warrior is that of a meat-shield.  They are supposed to take damage (while dishing out a reasonable supply) and keep the rest of the party alive by focusing a MOB or MOBs attention(s) on themselves.  The two tools a warrior has to affect this are damage output and taunt.  Since warriors are admittedly not all that high on the melee damage scale (easily out-damaged by monks and rogues, and often by rangers) and since they don't have high agro spells as to the hybrid classes, they are forced to rely on Taunt.  Unfortunately Taunt, especially at high levels is woefully inadequate to overcome the aforementioned deficiencies.  The recent fix implemented to make MOBs of level 50+ more tauntable helped, but not enough.  I'd suggest that whatever change went in needs to be improved some so that warrior taunt is more effective.<P>Another nice addition would be the addition of an "AE Taunt."  In multi-MOB situations it would be nice if the warrior had a skill that would attract the attentions of more than one mob in the vicinity.  Of course, this skill would have it's own drawbacks . . . be careful what you wish for.<P>Another area where Warriors seem to be a little lacking is in the AC and HP department.  I am not suggesting that a huge move is needed in either of these areas, but in the high level game, there is precious little difference between a warriors AC and HP versus the hybrids and melee "wizards" (Rogues and Monks)  I've even seen clerics with AC numbers within a few percent of a typically equipped warrior.  A few percent boost in Warrior HP and AC would really distinguish the Meat Shields in their role.  It would also help defer some of the downsides from the Taunt improvements recommended above.<P>Warrior damage output could also use a boost, again at the higher levels.  Logs parsed from large battles (Velious MOBS with 100k+ HP) easily show the huge disparity in damage output between Warriors and Rogues and Monks.  I wouldn't ask for a huge increase to match the other melee class damage, but warriors should be able to come closer.  This would also help taunt effectiveness.<P>And finally, there is the Warrior Epic weapon.  I know you don't like to read Epic stuff in these threads, but I still think it's relevant to the class as a whole.<P>The warrior epic is a nice item.  In its 2h configuration it is about as good as it gets, even in it's 1h configuration it's very nice, albeit a little slow.  The real problems with this item are the relative difficulty in acquiring it and the almost unbelievable fact that it has no haste. . . <P>Take a look at the other primarily melee epics:<P>Rogue: Ragebringer - 40% Haste, +ATK, +AC<BR>Monk: Celestial Fists: 40% Song haste, +12 AC and +40ATK - Stacks with Haste Items!! (CoF + Fists is nearly max haste!)<BR>Ranger: 40% Haste, +40ATK, massive Debuff w/slow<P>As compared to:<P>Warrior: Jagged blade of war: No haste, No +ATK, No +AC, minor Debuff/DD<P>This is further compounded by the relative difficulty of the warrior epic as compared to the others.  Why the double whammy?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

What follows are simply some suggestions, more in line with touching up a few details that have always bugged me.<P>1) New Skill - In general, the most common complaint I saw from warriors over the life of the game is the absolute lack of anything new to do between levels 25 and 50. Riposte (lvl 25) is a very useful skill, but it's passive, involving no action on the part of the player. Disarm (lvl 35) is indeed an active skill, but one which I would argue is largely useless (more on this skill later). I would propose adding a new skill (sometime between lvl 32 and 40) that would essentially allow a warrior to land a single blow for 4x max. damage (or all attacks landing in a particular round would do 4x max. damage). There should also be a stun component, at the very least a knock-back effect that would disrupt casting. To balance this out, I would suggest one of two things: either the warrior be prevented from attacking for 1-2 rounds after the attack is used, or simply a refresh time on the attack itself (perhaps 6-10 minutes). This is really just an idea to put SOMETHING in that void...by no means should it unbalance things. <P>2) Disarm - I would argue that this skill is largely useless, more so in the Kunark and Velious expansions. The idea, I assume, was that an enemy with a weapon was more dangerous than one without (generally) and disarming said opponent would be a significant move. I would like to see this examined in detail; to be honest, I never saw a great effect in the original zones unless the NPC was duel-wielding. In Kunark, very few NPC's wield weapons, most of those being magical. The few NPC's who do wield non-magical weapons (let's use the Drolvargs in Karnor's Castle as an example) can be disarmed, but it has no apparent effect on their combat ability. I haven't yet found anything in Velious that uses a weapon that can be disarmed. Surely there is something that could be done to make this skill useful? <P>3) Bind points - This is more of a general issue, but I think warriors would welcome this. (duh  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">)<P>4) Equipment - This may not be a balance issue per se, but I think warriors would be interested in the drop rate for Cobalt Bracers. This has been hashed out in many many previous threads; not many exist on any particular server, and the rate (I may be mistaken) seems far less than for the equivalent item for other classes.<P>5) There is no point 6.<P>As I said, just a few ideas...overall, I think warriors are fine. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, I see three things that could use some work:<P>1. Fun, we don't get to press enough buttons, and our eye candy(crits and crips) has been usurped by other classes, albeit in a lesser fashion.<P>2. Travelling:  I don't mind having no options available to me while I'm in a group, but when I've got to get to a zone to find a group, my choices are to find a SoW, buy a SoW potion, get Jboots (yeah right), get an escort, or die repeatedly.  Warriors are the only class that has no way out (not even an very unreliable one like Instill Doubt which rogues have)  Once JBoots are obtained, this imbalance is removed, but they are virtually impossible to get, as warriors have 0 percent chance of winning the Clusterfight at the AC spawn points, and convincing even your best RL friend to come blast the thing for you is damn near impossible.  The only solution I've come up with, is an easier quest that gives JBoots that cast Scale of Wolf instead of Spirit of wolf.  My concerns for this are that a) Scale of wolf is universally acknowledged as a death sentance if you rely upon it and b) it might be considered stepping on shaman/druid toes if this spell was farmed out.  I don't want to step on any classes toes, but this is a problem, which, for example, keeps me from going to Velious due to the dervishes in Iceclad.  <P>3. Taunting: two problems here, taunt doesn't work worth a damn on anything but light blues, and is somewhat unreliable there, and it requires us to use two one handers.  I play an ogre, and for RP purposes, I want to use a 2 hand weapon, High damage, high delay seems more ogrelike.  Problem is this: even if I do more damage with a two hander than I doe with a pair of one handers, the two hander simply does *not* allow me to taunt effectively off of anyone.  Oh sure, the taunt roll might be successful, and I'll eat one bash or kick from the mob, but it goes right back to beating on the ranger/rogue/monk/other warrior that is dual wielding.  I do not understand why the damage dealt per blow is any less important to the AI than the number of successful hits.  Please increase the taunt factor of 2handers.  This would also allow the pallys and SK's to taunt somewhat effectively, which is something I am all for, although they do have spells that serve them well in many cases for taunting.<P>-Dablogg <BR>48th season Craknek Warrior of Rallos Zek<BR>Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bah...5) There is no point 5, so much for that joke. <P>As an addition, I'd like to at least see taunt looked at for improvements. Regarding the recent changes, some nights I feel like it made a difference, some I don't. I've been very much in the air about this; ideally, if warriors are supposed to be the damage-absorbers, we should have a significant ability to get a mob's attention on us. The point about 2H weapon taunt ability is a good one as well.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well I was gonna post a cut/paste from another thread about warriors from awhile back but it appears to be gone.<P>Overall I don't think much of anything needs to be done to warriors.  The only thing I would recomend would be to reorganized what is already there.<P>Level 42 till 51 are lacking skill raises (unless they're practicing up weapons they've neglected).  It becomes a very boring time in a warrior career (granted now we have Kunark and Velious to explore at these times).  It would be nice if the skill raises were divided evenly between all the levels.<P>Rogues already do enough damage as is, what's the point of holding back the warrior piercing cap by 10 points?  This makes little sense to me.<P>Binding wounds, ease up on the skill cap on this.  Can't get over 200 until lvl 60?  Come on that is just silly.<P>Disarm, has very limited use (and practically no use at all in Velious), wouldn't mind seeing it redone into something that sees more regular use.<P>Disciplines in general.  Some of the /disc rock, others really bite.  Take some of those that really stink and spread them out at lower levels so they eventually become useful at higher levels.<P>Taunt, further improve it, or let our skill go above 200.  Just something, granted I'm kinda a ghetto warrior with odd equipment but I can't taunt jack off anyone even within a few levels of me in most circumstances.<P>Of all my skills Defense goes up slower by like a factor of 50.  Within half a yellow bubble of XP I've maxed all skills except defense which takes nearly the whole level to raise.  I don't know if this is a bug or intentional but might be worth looking into.<P>Okay skill points and whatnot are kinda a joke nowadays but a trainer in Velious and Kunark we could use would be welcome (perhaps I've just missed them).<P>Warrior Epic, has nice stats and effects but the dam/delay ratio needs a look'n at.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Not much really wrong... As many have said, Taunt needs to be looked at, we should be able to taunt much better then we do right now.  What about increasing the taunt cap for Us (and Palys and SK's, to just under what Warrior taunt cap is).<P>Area of Effect Taunt is a very neat idea.. dont know the feasibility of it.<P>The Warrior Epic.  I know you said you didnt want to talk about this.. but, this is an issue for us.<P>Problem, 1) Main hand delay too low.  Main hand proc rocks (according to my friends that have it), how about something like what was done with Rangers, Make one main hand, other off, and main hand something like 11/19, 13/21, 10/18, something along those lines. <P>Problem 2) Rare Drops.  Now, i dont mind a rare drop... but as it stands, Maestro's Hand and Sev are in there (red scale and spiroc blades arent terribly rare, but they arent water either).  Add to that the Ancient Blade from the Chardok Queen.  This is the real problem.  Why not make the Queen Blade a Quest as well, that way, when we go down ther to kill her, she always has something.  Many warriors on my server are hitting this wall, their clerics and chanters have their FA's, so there is no real reason to head back down there.. so many are sitting with one thing left, this blade.<P>So, making both blades a quest would help alleviate this situation, and if there were other rare drops, make it so that one group of people could go get them, as opposed to inconviencing 24-30 to camp a spot, that may not even have what you need at it.<P>Other then those things.. i love being a warrior.<P>Petr Elvenblade<BR>Myrmidon<BR>Kel'Daoine<BR>Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>this is coming from a 60 war, I won the botb on my server and i'm getting my epic wed so I think I'd know what i'm talking about.<P>Issue 1: Taunting, we suck at it, the Taunt cap needs to be raised, Warrior weapons need to be the same ratio but faster in general to help us taunt, Warriors are supposed to be the masters of melee but we are the worst taunting class in the game.<P>Issue 2: Epic reward, the 2hander is fine, but the 1handers are a damage DOWNGRADE from a Jade mace and Blade of the Black Dragon Eye, please balance the 1handers so they'd give the same percentage increase in damage as the Rogue FA would give over a Blood point.<P>Issue 3: Epic risk, I have no problem doing everything that's required for my epic, BUT, the drop rates are out of whack, for example, in Chardok, the Prince drops the head for the Enchanter epic 100% of the time, the King drops the note for the Cleric epic 100% of the time, yet the Queen drops the blade for the Warrior epic 40% of the time? Plus, in Hate the Maestro has a really small chance to drop the hand, and in Sky the Spiroc Lord has a really small chance to drop the Wingblade.<P>Issue 4: Cobalt drop rates, Cobalt Helm is a random drop off Froglok Reet Knights, Cobalt Bracer is a random drop off Myconids, it's pathetic when a Helm or Bracer is rarer than the class BP or Legs, please increase the drop rate.<P>Issue 5: Cobalt BP and Helm are 2x the weight of EVERY single other BP and Helm, every other piece of Cobalt is the same weight as all of the other Kunark quest armors, please fix.<P>Issue 6: Cobalt BP and Mrylokar BP both drop off Trakanon, they both have the effect of Invigorate, Yet the Mrylokar BP is twice as fast casting. Please increase the cast time on the Mrylokar BP or decrease the cast time on the Cobalt BP to make it balanced.<P>Summary: Increase Taunt cap and effectiveness, Increase ratio of Epics to match other melee class epics, make Ancient Blade, Hand of the Maestro, Spiroc Wingblade drop 100% of the time, Increase drop rate of Cobalt Helm and Bracer, decrease weight of Cobalt Helm and Breastplate, reducing casting time on effect of Cobalt Breastplate.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Regarding warriors:<P>I think we're a great class, I love playing mine.  However, <BR>there are some things I'd like to see.  I'd like to see <BR>abilities which make our function more than just a <BR>must-taunt-em meatshield.  Not necessarily damage <BR>based either!  All of these are based on the 40+<BR>warrior.<P>Assuming we got new abilities, I'd like to see us get <BR>them in them in the 36-50 range, where we currently <BR>have no other skills to look forward to.<P>Some ideas follow.  Please note that I am posting <BR>these as warrior-specific/only, and give rough level <BR>suggestions for when we would get the new skill.<P>1) <BR>A new version of taunt, with a minimum time that <BR>the mob will fixate on the warrior, the time <BR>perhaps increasing with level, or becoming less <BR>likely to fail?  Perhaps a refresh timer 2x regular <BR>taunt. Level 40+<P>Uses: General taunt, making sure that the function<BR>we're seen as having (meat shield) can actually <BR>be performed.<P>2) <BR>An area-effect no-fail taunt, with a refresh timer <BR>of no less than 60 seconds.  Level 40+<P>Uses: Give the casters time for evac, chanters<BR>time to mez on mad pull, last ditch effort.<P>3) <BR>An area-affect fear/instill doubt, as an <BR>innate ability. Usable ONLY if the warrior is<BR>at less than 5 percent health.  NOT infallable.<BR>Level 45.<P>Uses: Same as #2, last ditch evac/escape.<P><BR>Really, the only issues I have with the class are:<P>1)<BR>No way to escape, except jboots.  We fight, or we die.  <BR>Sometimes both.<P>2)<BR>Lack of 'stuff' to do while fighting.  There is a ton<BR>of tactical info we need to keep track of and perhaps<BR>act on during a typical fight, but there isn't much<BR>in the way of actions we can take.  Target, taunt, hit.<BR>More actions, even useless! more buttons, we like buttons,<BR>we're dumb and like to poke things!<P>3)<BR>The epic.  The problems with it not being better than a<BR>lot of other warrior weapons have been well noted, so<BR>I won't go over them again.<P>4) <BR>Hitpoints.  More would be nice! &lt;duh, you say! =)&gt;<BR>Seriously, I'd like to have 1k or so more HP than a<BR>SK or paladin my level.  100-400 more hp, as it is<BR>now even with great gear, is nice, but doesn't<BR>differentiate us enough.  If you want to look at it<BR>another way... warriors gave up spells for hitpoints<BR>and defense/offensive skill.  Make it worth the trade  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>5)<BR>As a general note, I'd rather not see new /disciplines <BR>for taunt.  As the disciplines all have the same timer<BR>and taunt is a very needed function, we'd essentially<BR>be locked out of our other disciplines.<P><BR>6)<BR>Disarm is a joke.  But then other classes have it as<BR>well, and it's mainly seen as a useless skill.  Perhaps<BR>adding some use to it?  I can see it would be difficult,<BR>however.<P>7)<BR>Resists.  I'd like to see our innate Magic Reists that we<BR>doubled per level after 40.  We're often the target of the<BR>magic attacks, after 40+ levels of being hit by it and watching<BR>casters maybe we've learned to resist it better?<P>8)<BR>Recycle times on disciplines seem a little excessive, in my<BR>non-discipline having opinion.<P>9)<BR>Critical<P>I'd like to see more critical hits. Considering they are hardly<BR>more damage, and in most cases LESS than average damage, it'd<BR>be nice to have more eye candy.  2x more often would be awesome<P>10)<BR>When berzerk, I'd like to see us get approx 5x more critical<BR>hits than whatever our normal critical hit percentage is.  We're<BR>supposed to be ticked off, dangit!  Have you seen ixiblat fer<BR>(spelling wrong) when he becomes enraged just before death?

I more often than not find myself unable to tank at all,<BR>even when taunting all i can, just because someone else immediately got back<BR>on top of the mobs hate list after i taunted. When you gave the monks<BR>"Celestial Fists" (9-16) weapons, they also got the ability to taunt better<BR>than i have ever been able to. Increasing the amount of "hate points" a<BR>successful taunt gives, would solve this. In addition, it would solve much<BR>of the problems rangers/monks have with low armor class and hp's when<BR>grouped with a warrior. This reasoning is much the same as the one used when<BR>you increased taunt value of the "Rage of Vallon" proc on warrior epics<BR>(14-24). When im the only one in a group who isnt hurt at the end of a<BR>fight, somethings wrong (and it happens quite a bit lately since all high<BR>level monks have Celestial Fists..) Maybe you could make it equal to<BR>"Ensnare" in taunt value ? Rangers and druids seem to have great success<BR>taunting off warriors with this spell..<P>Kick <P>Increase the taunt value of the stun kick for warriors. Maybe not needed if<BR>you increase the effectivity of taunt itself. Also, make it always interrupt<BR>casters if it hits. As it is now, there is 2 factors that limit its<BR>usefulness for interrupting casters. 1) your kick misses, and 2) the kick<BR>fails to interrupt. If it hits, it should also interrupt automatically.<P>Other classes getting to close to warriors <P>I believe that warriors should be able to tank better than Paladins and<BR>Shadow Knights. I see that you "noted" those classes wishes for higher hp,<BR>better defensive skills, higher offansive skills etc etc. What they asked<BR>for, was for you to make their tanking ability close to the warriors. Our<BR>tanking ability vs most normal mobs is fine (except for taunt), but if you<BR>increase the tanking ability of the SK and Paladin, keep in mind that there<BR>would be no real reason to play a warrior at all. Why play a warrior without<BR>spells when you can play a warrior with spells.<P>Stamina and AC <P>Make more Stamina-High AC gear available to small warriors PLEASE, name it<BR>"Small Cobalt", and make it wearable only by small-medium warriors. After 60<BR>levels of playing a wood elf warrior with base stamina 75, I finally managed<BR>to get my stamina to 130'ish not long ago. With Ogres being able to get<BR>around 200 stamina, this creates a HUGE gap in the desirability between<BR>ogres and wood elves or similar races. 70 Stamina at level 60 is a LOT of<BR>hps...Maybe you could implement a "trade in blacksmith" much like the one<BR>thats resizing Crafted Armor. Balancing the classes is all nice, but how<BR>about balancing the races a bit against each other as well. The race you<BR>chose should determine what kind of equipment you should go for, it should<BR>not make you an overall worse tank than those ogre warriors that seem to be<BR>everywhere..in my opinion ofcourse.<P>Gear <P>Venril Sathir. Is there any reason why you can not move the greaves onto<BR>other mobs? For example, have one mob in Chardok drop warrior and ranger<BR>greaves, and another mob, maybe in Howling Stones? drop druid - shaman<BR>greaves? The 7 days spawn time on VS and 3 days on Trakanon does make no<BR>sense, especially since VS is very likely to drop a few staffs that noone<BR>need instead of greaves that all need. Have VS drop only staffs and epic<BR>items, or only greaves. Alternatively, decrease the repop time, and have him<BR>drop more legs. Should not breastplates be rarer than legs? This is not the<BR>case as it is today.<P>Gear 2 <P>Whats with the drop rate of the cobalt bracer ?? On Mithaniel Marr there are<BR>less cobalt bracers than breastplates! I know no other class that has so<BR>many hard to get pieces of their kunark armor. Most of their armor drop of<BR>low level mobs in Karnor, or as loot of rare spawns. Only other class i can<BR>think of that is kind of close in difficulty is the Shadow Knight. We have<BR>found more Sebilite Croaking Dirks (2) than Blood Ember Helms (1) and Cobalt<BR>Bracers.. (0)<P>Disciplines <P>The disciplines for warriors is too much alike! In reality, we only have 6<BR>disciplines. defensive, offensive, critical hits, damage multiplier, "always<BR>hit", and riposte. I dont count "fearless" and "resistant" because of their<BR>gayness. Why not give us something new every level instead of "improved"<BR>versions of what we already have, and make the effectiveness of the<BR>disciplines we already have increase each level? This would create new ways<BR>for us to be useful in, and not be unbalancing, because of the high reuse<BR>placed on disciplines. Speaking of reuse..Did you know that rogues Riposte<BR>discipline refreshes in 30 minutes while warriors refresh in an hour? Why<BR>this difference? Is riposte too unbalancing for warriors and not rogues?<BR>This might be true for other disciplines as well, i have not looked too much<BR>into that.<P>Critical Hits <P>These things could have been really great, if they did more than look fancy.<BR>As it is today, they occur to rarely to make any impact on your overall<BR>damage at all. Feel free to run tests on this. How about adding a stun<BR>effect to the normal critical hit as well as the crippling blow? This would<BR>make many happy  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> In addition, Dexterity seems to have no impact on how<BR>often the critical hits occur, as it should. It is a "proc" afterall.<P>Bucket heads <P>How about changing the bucket helm model on wood elfs and humans please? not<BR>really a balance issue, but i got a cobalt helm the other day i might not<BR>ever use because of the helm model...take a look around on any server and<BR>see how many wood elf females you find with a bucket on her head  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Too bad<BR>a helm model prevents me and many others from using the best gear available<BR>to us. Looks is important !  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I cant think of more, VI did a good job on making the warrior class an<BR>entertaining one. And thanks for listening  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Aanya Daimone<BR>60 Woodelf Warrior<BR>Mithaniel Marr<BR>Forsaken Realm<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Oh one other thing that is possibly a bug.  Maybe I'm just a left handed troll but I swear I get criticals in my off hand about 33% more often then my main hand.  That does really seem logical.  Perhaps it's just me seeing thing.  But while on the subject, why not make crits/crips do a bit more than they do.  As is the majority of them are just an additional line of spam.

</FONT><HR>I think warriors are a ton of fun.  IMHO almost perfect with just a few minor problems:<P>#1: Make taunt work for mobs over level 55.  What about making taunt work as an AE effect with a small-ish range over level 55?  That way you could keep many MOBs off casters.<P>#2: Put the locket of escape back in the game.  It was an excellent item that allowed melee to be bound anywhere casters could, it was rare, had only one charge and was lore.  Seems like a perfect way to handle the melee binding issue.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>as a class warriors are well balanced<P>things i would like to see?,<P>One - increase taunts efectivenes on all mobs post 55.<P>Two - the epic it just is not up to par with the others and there are literaly doznes of wepaons that out do it now.<P>The lack of + atack or + to haste is foolish and its to slow.<P>Add to that the dificulty of it You know i have been waitign on the queen in chardok for 5 months?<P>we get about one guild raid every 3 weeks to go there cause NOTHING anyone else needs in there drops since at each raid we get 3 or 4 cleric notes and all the clerics n guild have their epics after the third raid.<P>So far out of 6 dead queens not one blade. Yet EVERY other class who needs a epic item from chardok its a 100 % for sure drop the princes head the herbs the note etc. While we have the hardest mob in the dungeon who drops our item verry rare.<P>3 - I wouold love to se a minimum damage on criticle hits i meanit jsut makes me cry when i see you havescored a ciritcal hit ( 18 ) <BR>base it on levels if you want.<P>4 - last thing would help all clases but at least for the meelee clases make marizn stack with aegolism.<P>even with 5000 hp i have run into mobs that can kill me faster then a single compleat heal can go off. These same mobs have 300 thousand hp makeign them 15 mintis fights. <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Over all warriors are balanced. Theres just a few things that need some work.<BR>1) Taunt. I simply still does not work hardly at all post 50. It needs to tuant harder and work better on 51+ MOBS. Also as you get higher in levels it should recycle faster, say at 55 it would recycle at half the time.<BR>2) Disciplines. Overall these are nice but some could use a little work. And not the kind of improvements the guy above listed for disciplines.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Since so many high level mobs (especially SoV mobs) are very magic resistant, warriors (and meleers in general) become essential for any group. To a certain extent, IMO, this balances out the disparity between casting classes and melee classes in terms of group usefulness/soloing at lower levels. Whether this is perfectly balanced is something that should be looked at and adjusted if need be.<P>However, the balance between melee classes is something that probably isn't perfect yet. Most melee classes can't solo well, especially when compared to casting classes, so what has to carefully be considered is grouping usefulness. So what is most useful in a group for a melee class?<P>Damage absorption<BR>Since casters obviously can't absorb much damage, melee classes must do this. HP, AC, resists, disciplines, and block/parry/dodge/riposte skills must be balanced such that all melee classes are not a liability to the group. The efficiency of complete heal also factors into this, since more damage can be absorbed per mana point. Warriors are probably the gold standard for this. Also, due to this primary role of warriors, the taunt cap should be increased to make this more effective, and uncouple the damage dealing ability of other classes from the damage absorption of warriors.<P>Damage dealing<BR>Since melee damage is very important in high level encounters, this must also be balanced between melee classes. Weapons, weapon skill caps, riposte, and disciplines must be balanced, again so no class is a liability to the group. Rogues are probably the gold standard for this, followed by monks, warriors, rangers, and the other hybrids. However, there is a large disparity (IMO) between the damage dealt by rogues and other melee classes. If damage dealing is part of the role of monks and warriors, I think it should carefully examined whether the drawbacks to rogue damage (i.e., lower damage absorption and defenses) are balanced with the dramatically lower damage dealt by monks and warriors in regular grouping situations.<P>Also, it must be noticed that every single piece of equipment added to the game can shift the balance dramatically. Ragebringer is a good example of this, since it increased damage of those rogues that have it by a significant amount. If rogues were balanced pre-Ragebringer, then post-Ragebringer they aren't any more. Or monks and fighting batons at mid-levels. Or warriors and wurmslayers. It's something to be very careful about, adding items.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've been watching the SK talk, and part of the problem there is that an improvement of the SK's defense (and, I'm sure, the Paladin's, when their talk begins) would be an intrusion on the Warrior's role as the ultimate defense.  One way to give the  SK and Paladin some wiggle room to improve their defense would be to improve the Warrior's defense in tandem.  But how to do so without making Warriors completely uber?  I came up with two ideas.<P>Idea #1<BR>As far as I know, all races and classes experience a penalty to AC when attacked from the rear, and as far as I know this penalty is equal (I have not seen anyone suggest otherwise or do any particular study on this).  What if we remove or reduce this penalty for the Warrior class?  It would only make sense that Warriors would know how to guard their back better than other classes.  If removing the penalty entirely is too much, then it could simply be reduced, say by 50 percent, or added as a discipline.<P>Idea #2<BR>All Ogres are immune to melee stun from the front.  What if we extend this ability to all warriors?  Right, the Ogres are going to be outraged!  To make them happy, give the Ogre Warrior immunity to melee stun from the back as well.  Okay, this does seem like a pretty large improvement to the Warrior class, and I can understand if this gets a flat no.  But a gift like this to the Warrior class would let you give an equally good gift to the SKs and Paladins.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 9 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052809-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052809&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052809&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
