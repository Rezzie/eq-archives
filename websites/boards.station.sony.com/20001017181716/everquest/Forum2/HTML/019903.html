</FONT><HR>I was just curious on the policies on items that are dropped on the ground?  My son was in freeport and found a bag on the ground.  He picked it up to find it was a backpack with vegetables and fishing grubs.  He found it worthless and put it back.  I saw and suggested he keep the backpack as that was a waste if it vanished.  No sooner was it then I said that someone started yelling accross the zone, "&lt;name&gt; is a liar and thief and stole items while I was giving them to another character!"<P>Now I have to be honest.  I thought the "Are you absolutely sure you want to drop this item on the ground" window would alleviate stuff like this from happening.  So I figgured nothing to worry about as the GMs won't even bother.<P>Well 5 minutes later a Female Bard (lvl 50) GM Showed up demanding the jewlery inside the bag be returned.  I explained the situation and she said return it or she'll have the GMs pull the logs and if they had to sort through all that then find me lying that I took the items off the ground then I could be banned.<P>  That took me as massive shock! After seeing that my son was in tears!!!  <P>Finally I explained what I saw, did a report on my computer to log her yelling across the zone about my son, recapped (He redropped the bag, there was no jewlery and there was no one at all by the bag)  And she said it can still get me banned.<P>Is giving equipment to another one of your characters allowed and protected by GMs in that fashion?  And is all what she said true?  Thank you,<P>Darthion</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>well, if what I read about what is involved in bannings elsewhere on the internet (url omitted to comply with board rules) was right, there is a lot of paperwork involved in banning someone. Unless the GM doctors the logs, you have a good chance of getting *someone* to eventually review your case if you are banned "anyway" and getting your account back after a while.<P>To be on the safe side, take an inventory on your stuff asap; strange things have happend to chars during the time they were temporarily suspended and under review. (Then again, these people were suspected of duping, and lost things like bandages and food and chain armor they had looted)<P>Good job on /reporting the GM, be sure you mention it if this comes up for further review.<P>Personally, though, geeze, anybody that made my kid cry would get a *lot* of flak from me, and I'd re-evaluate what if any reason I had to continue doing business with them and/or thier parent company.<P>As for the policies, Dartion, this might be under the 'whatever the GM says is the rules' rules that are not written up or down, or posted anywhere. Each server has a different set.<P>But anything unattended on the ground is pretty much fair play; and I have no problem with keeping things I have found, once I have made a reasonable assesment of it, and made appropriate attempts to  retun it to it's owner:<P>- Empty bag, say or shout to the zone did someone lose a container, if they know what it is, they can claim it.<P>- bag with stuff, same<P>- item of normal rarity or value (piece of armor or weapon), shout to the zone that an item was found, etc.<P>- extremely "valuable" item: /petition about it incase it turns up missing and shouts don't fix it.<P>-Merrily<P>*disclaimer* This post, to the best of my ability, conforms the guidelines of behaviour listed in the Everquest Rulez of Conduct located at http://everquest.station.sony.com/s_conduct.html.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The whole reason they put in this drop confirmation crap was so they wouldn't have to deal with issues like this. I don't care if someone dropped a yak on the floor. The GM certainly should not have reprimanded you. As well, they should have logs to show that you do not have any of the offending items on you. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>This is the type of mistreatment by GMs that aggravates me. They oftentimes act as if we are all teens trying to 'pull a fast one.'  GMs should never, under any circumstance, assume that a customer is guilty and threaten them before checking out the evidence.  <P>This is also a case where the GM needs to know the company's own policy--a dropped item will not be reimbursed, period.  I've had people run off with an item I've accidentally dropped before. Did I petition or scream and whine? No--I asked /ooc that the item be returned, and when it wasn't, I wasn't really surprised.  Sounds to me like the player who lost the items needs to be set in a corner for quiet time alongside the GM.  <P>And as for the GM making your son cry--please, call and complain to someone about it.  Contact a real person via telephone.  Sympathy and understanding is much easier to achieve if they hear your voice and realize you are a real father with a genuine concern for your child.  <P>Good luck, and keep us posted on what happens.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Isn't there always a GM at the chat rooms that you can go into when you login?  If a GM was acting wrongly, could you /report them, tell them that you reported them and are camping to the chat to talk to another GM, and then do it?<P>I think your situation sounds fairly clear.  <P>If the situation was different in that you did take some expensive items, I'm not sure how that would be handled in the end.  And, that is a good policy question.  Ninja looting and trade fraud are bannable.  So people presume they can get their items back now by petitioning.  But in the case of explicitly dropping them, that seems like a big assumption to me.  If you dropped an SMR and I picked it up and refused to give it back, what would happen?  What is the policy?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

It was a weapon for my warrior that had to have a general slot open.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">  hehe anyways I have always thought the GM's were nice people not having dealt with them in over a year until my situation came up the other day (http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019743.html).  I just thought a bunch of kids were whine'n about the GM's.  I do hope that Sony takes the situation under control SOON!  I find Sony to be very good at CS!<P>On the other hand while dropped stuff might be ok to pick up and keep, I would send someone /shout'n or /ooc'n if anyone found a bag to tell me what was in it since I had looted one off the groud.  If they could tell me what was in it, np giving it back.  Of course this was not the case in your situation since the bag that your son found did not contain what the guy was saying he picked up.<P>I understand your frustration in being treated with disrespect from a GM, as I feel I was the other night!  My point to Sony today was "I will NOT be talked to as a child while dealing with GM's and I will NOT fear them telling me that talking to a CS rep is not a good thing" hehe I requested to talk to whomever the GM was talking to and he informed me this was "not a good thing to do"<P>Hope you and your son continue to play and enjoy the game!!!!<P>Soffia</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Thanks for the reply's everyone.  As for the idea of not continuing business, there are 4 family members under 2 accounts (1 parent & 1 child on each account according to policy) and no matter how bad they got I wouldn't have the heart to remove EQ out of my kids' life.  It has tremendously helped their reading, their typing and their sentence construction skills.  Not to mention their bartering skills!   I will mention this to our lead gm via email and give verant a call.. It certainly can't hurt!<P>Here's something that I've actually been afraid to ask.  That same GM (when I mentioned my child was upset) mentioned that children shouldn't be playing and new rules say that the minimum age is 13.  Anything under 13 is not allowed to play online.  Now one of my son's is under 13.... Has anyone else heard of this before I call about that as well?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

But..<P>I think the "No under 13" ruling is on the EULA, and it was added in by Verant to cover themselves due to New regulations on what a Net Company can and cannot do with information. If i remember , it has something to do with not being allowed to hold information in Company Databases (ie: all those details you fill in when you create your account) if that person is under a certain age.<BR> I dont think Verant hunts down anyone below that age, but they have the rule in place so they cant get into trouble.. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Just for the record, there are _no_ rules _anywhere_, not even in the EULA, that state that children under the age of 13 can't play.<P>This is the biggest misconception people have about the EULA, and I'm shocked that a GM fell victim to it...although, given the inappropriate behavior, it probably shouldn't surprise me at all.<P>What the EULA _does_ state that no one under the age of 13 can have an account in his/her name, but this does not exclude them from playing. This is per the Child Online Protection Act (COPA) which prohibits companies or other entities from collecting the personal information (name, age, telephone number, address, e-mail address, etc) of anyone under the age of 13.<P>So, Darthion, definitely contact _someone_ about this. That GM deserves to be reprimanded in a big way. And by all means, continue to let your children play. I know I'd do the same.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I'm not sure why a GM would have gotten involved in this situation as it's a clear-cut case of someone dropping something.  When we put in the item-drop confirmation box we made a policy determination that GMs would no longer get involved when people drop items, that anyone who is concerned that they might drop an item should leave the feature on.<P>In this case, based upon what you say the original owner of the dropped items shouted, they evidented dropped it so that they could log out and log on another character to get the items.  As far as I'm concerned it was indeed fair game. <P>If you'd be so kind as to kick me the name of the GM in an email at gwrinn@verant.com, I'll be happy to look into the situation.<P>Regarding the "under 13" thing, that has to do with a law that prevents us from storing information about people under the age of 13.  There is no restriction however on who may play EverQuest given parental permission, just who we may have listed as the owner of the account.  The EULA grants you, and one minor child living with you, a license to play on the same account.  The age of your child and whether or not EQ represents appropriate content for that child is up to you.<P>Please accept my apologies for this situation.  <P>-Gordon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I dont think you understand the problem.. If you trade from one char to another and you put in the trade window more than the other char can handle it drops to the ground. I think it should be fixed and those items go back to the original person instead of dropping onf the ground.  Also If time has passed and and the bag is in a populated area and no one is around it. seems to me that it becomes property of finders keepers loosers weepers.<P>I had 100pp pieces worth of silk armor for my monk when trading in the bank with a GREAT friend of mine I became full and one bad dropped and I lost a full bag of armor. The bankers got it .05 sec after it dropped to keep the bank clear according to the guide and GM that assisted me when I petitioned. I was not reimbursed.. To the person that lost the bag maybe next time you will ask how many spots do you have open and put only that amount of items in the trade window. <P>Kyrrack <BR>47th season Druid<BR>Kollouff<BR>29 season Necromancer.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
