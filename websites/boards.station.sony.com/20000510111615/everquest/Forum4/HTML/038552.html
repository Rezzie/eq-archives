</FONT><HR>Why did you make it such a pain in the ass to travel through Kunark? Let me give you a few examples of what I am talking about.<P>Half the monsters that roam kunark outdoor zones can see invisibility. I am not questioning that some special magical monsters can see invis, but for GOD'S SAKE, rhino's can see invis? Stupid simple animal's like a rhino can see invis? Where is the logic in that? Absolutely none. Yeti's too? Even those stupid ape/brutes in Frontier Mtns? Come on, you cannot possible come up with any justification other than "we want to make kunark travel difficult." Yes, you are, but you are doing it illogically, and the only result is annoying players like me. Invisibility is next to useless. Thank you verant ;(<P>Secondly, half the monsters move as fast, if not faster than sow. Meaning as I travel with my journeyman boots, if I get jumped, I have to fight. There is no option of fleeing at all. This is stupid. As magician, this is 10 times worst. As a result of this stupidity, I have to summon a pet in every zone just to ensure that I don't die because I cannot root or snare or enthrall my monsters away. And because you moved Velocity back to level 58, i have to travel at walk speed to keep the pet behind me.<P>Thirdly, even the WEAKEST green trash will attack me. I am level 52 and even those stupid ****atrices that are level 26ish will attack me. Why do I have to put up with that? This by itself isn't bad, but you couple it with the fact that monsters move as fast as jboots, and see invis, it's just plain silly. Traveling in kunark is absurd and annoying. This isn't PoF, come on. At least let invisibility work, or invent "improved invisibility." It doesn't make Kunark cool, it's just causes unnecessary downtime.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>You don't have to put up with it.  Verant has officially stated Kunark to be "At Your Own Risk".  Do you need any further hints that it will be difficult?  As for the realism of a rhino being able to see invis, didn't realism go out the window the first time you saw a BARMAID kill a level 16 Paladin in full banded after about ten punches when he accidentally typed an 'a' while the barmaid was targetted?  Let's not talk too much about 'realism'.  You are on more solid ground when you ask what the justification is.  I guess they DO want to make travel on Kunark more difficult than a walk in the park.  Again if this is too tough for you, stay with the planes.<P>Vnad<BR>TZ</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Akipaul - <BR>Give me a break, he has some legitimate complaints here. I don't think traveling Kunark should be easy, but it's stupid that it's as difficult as it is. The greens do tons of dmg, and jump all over me too. It's not like he's saying "the blues are too hard" or something stupid - he's talking about mobs half his level, green to him probaly 20 levels ago, that he cannot escape, and can't even beat without his pet. And you can't see why he's frustrated? It was a reasonable post, no need to flame him over it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I have to say that i'm really glad i didnt rush out and buy the RoK expansion. I was suspicious that it would just be for high level characters (yeah yeah you can make a new lizard and blah) and it would be teaming with problems. All i have read on the boards confirms my opinion.<BR>Everything sees invisble. Poor frame rates on top notch machines. Super sprinting creatures. Evil creatures having to watch their faction or not being able to trade on the continent. Cant get new spells. Sounds like rage and flustration just waiting to happen. I dont think i'll be paying my money for a nice slice of flustration.<BR>Sounds like Verant has some thinking to do. Perhaps in 6 months they may sort these out problems like last time. But it does show that it doesnt pay to be the first to try out a new MMG or its expansion.<BR>They seem to want to make things harder and more flustrating, not fun. Perhaps they feel that they need to make RoK last another year for the uber levelers to reach its pinacles rather than give the average player something that would entertain? Shame about the frame rates though, the screen shots look very nice, and the ideas seem good.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>One of my main gripes of Kunark Traveling is the invisible zone wall.  There are numerous areas where it looks like you can keep going, but end up hitting one of those invisible walls.

</FONT><HR>I agree with a lot of what you're saying here, lodrin, but just to play the devil's advocate:<P>Most animal's have terrible eye sight and rely much more on hearing and smelling.  I believe rhinos fit into that catagory.<P>Maybe they should add a couple spells:<BR>hide smell and silence.<BR>of course, if you're silenced, you'll have trouble casting spells that have a vocal component to them...<P>=p<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I have to agree with the thread creator. It's bizarre to get around from the wizard spire in the Dreadlands.<P>You make it to the Ice Tunnel, and a green spider/Rager attacks you and does an insane amount of damage.<P>It's cool, you're a tough guy. You step out of the ice tunnel and a green spider attacks you again.<P>That's cool too because you're still tough.<P>You make the dash for Firiona Vie or the Castle, a green giant attacks you. He's not stunnable and root breaks like an ice sickle in June. But that's cool.<P>Since you're outta mana/healing, you sit down and...<P>You're attacked by a green....<P>Woohoo!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

It was obvious pretty soon that my 1900hp wouldn't be up to the task and I had to pick a direction and run...luckily I hit a zone line into a swamp where I am now camped waiting for a druid friend to pick me up.

If it can see through my invis I'm gonna try and fear it.  If I can do one and not the other, there is a definate problem.

</FONT><HR>That is interesting that you are having trouble with invis. I often sit in the midst of the Rhino's and Giant CHickens without getting attacked. If I am standing (or even fighting) most of the time even the cats leave me alone. <BR>I do agree that there should be a compelling reason for something to see through invis. I have not been everywhere in RoK to check out everything as the Freeport Guard hunting is just too sweet. Six min spawn, multiple zones close by, low train rate, don't have to look all over as you know exactly when thay are going to spawn.<BR>I hope Verant up's a few of the guards level so I can stay longer.  &lt;g&gt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>An animal as dumb as a rhino has to rely on all his senses to function.  So if he smells something but doesn't see it, does he instinctivly know that something is there and that it's invisible?  Does he have any concept of what it means to be invisible? Does his pea-sized brain tell him to charge in the direction of the smell? No, I don't think so.  I think he could be confused and not know what to do.  He would probably wander around dumbfounded, sniffing the air all around him looking for what he can smell but can't see.  The arguement that he will attack on sight due to smell just doesn't hold up, at all....<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I travel through Kurnak visible and with sow.  Nothing has caught up to me with sow yet, and I've traveled all but two of these zones.  I agree a rhino seeing thru invis is stupid, but it's most likely an oversight in the design of the mob. Lets face it, Kurnak wasn't thoroughly beta tested. Also, the likelyhood of something red seeing through invis is more likely than something that is green to you, so bear that in mind.<P>In any event, If I were you i'd try listing the mobs that see through your invis and what they con to you here, and suggest that they need to be fixed rather than flying off the handle.  But then again, well thought out posts usually get ignored on this board anyway, you might better get a response from your original post.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Another thing you have to remember is that simply conning something is not necessarily indicative of the success of invisibility.  A lot of MOBs, when you're invis, will still look like they're about to attack, but when you get around them they don't.  E.g., the piranhas in the river in Nektulos.  Go invis and they still scowl at you ready to attack.  Or the DW caimans and crocs in Oasis.  <P>Now, I haven't traveled around Kunark much, but I would bet that a number of these monsters which people think see through invis don't.  And people just haven't wanted to make sure by actually going down and standing in front of them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
