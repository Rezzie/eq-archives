&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>In the past I have posted some ideas on trade skills, and have seem some of the ideas actually find their way to the game, so either I'm thinking along the same lines as Verant or maybe they got an idea or two from looking at these boards. So here are a few more thoughts:<P>Poison vials. When a rogue successfully poisons a weapon, it should return a Contaminated Poison Vial that is cleaned by putting it into a kiln with some alcohol, esencially boiling it out. This would return a Poison Vial. In other words, this would cut down the cost of using poisons slightly, by eliminating the need to at least buy poison vials.<P>Pelts. In a world that runs rampant with various fur-bearing creatures, and in a world that has a great deal of demand for such pelts, there are no trappers? There should be at least one fellow or lady in each zone with a lot of these creatures that is a trapper. This person could sell any given pelt that is in the area, and perhaps some tailoring supplies. They could charge for pelts by varying degrees... and this would GREATLY increase the availability of such pelts. <P>Consider this: ONLY Tailoring requires not only every piece of raw material to be hunted down (some of which are very rare, quest-level rare), but it is the ONLY trade skill that REQUIRES other trades to advance in, to its low maximum skill of 115. Honestly I really appreciate the smithing fixes and additions, but Smithing really was not the trade that needed the most attention.<P>Here I want to repeat a call for a tailoring idea. Presently you can take a skinning knife and pare down a pelt to a lesser state, MQ to LQ and so forth. This is very handy. However, a tailor could patch together pieces of lesser pelts to make something BETTER as well.<P>So here is again what I propose:<P>Combine 2 ruined pelts in a kit to make 1 Low Quality pelt of that type. (trivial at 20)<BR>Combine 2 Low Quality pelts in a kit to make 1 Medium Quality pelt of that type. (trivial at 40)<BR>combine 2 Medium Quality pelts in a kit to make 1 High Quality pelt of that type. (trivial at 60)<P>and I'd like to add this:<P>Combine 2 skins (lion skin, grizzly skin, etc) of no quality to make 1 Ruined Pelt of that type (cat, bear, etc).<P>I'm sure other people have ideas of this type too, such as recipes for bronze armor, fine steel weapons, etc.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>also, another thing that would be cool, would be to be able to take a pelts and improve the quality or change the size of the pelt to substitute.<P>Examples:<BR>Ruined Cat Pelt + Ruined Cat Pelt + Silk Thread + Skinning Knife = LQ Cat Pelt + Skinning Knife<BR>LQ Cat Pelt + LQ Cat Pelt + Silk Thread + Skinning Knife = MQ Cat Pelt + Skinning Knife<BR>MQ Cat Pelt + MQ Cat Pelt + Silk Thread + Skinning Knife = HQ Cat Pelt + Skinning Knife<BR>HQ Cat Pelt + HQ Cat Pelt + Silk Thread + Sizing Knife = Large HQ Cat Pelt (can be substitited for a HQ Bear Pelt) + Sizing Knife<BR>Grizzly Bear Skin + Skinning Knife = HQ Bear Pelt + Skinning Knife<BR>Black Wolf Skin  + Skinning Knife = HQ Wolf Pelt + Skinning Knife<BR>etc.<P>so, with no failures, it can take 16 Ruined Cat Pelts, and 30 Spiderling Silks (to make the Silk Threads) to make 1 Large HQ Cat Pelt that can be substituted for 1 HQ Bear Pelt, and as it seems, will take a bit longer than actually getting a MQ Bear Pelt<P>---<BR>Multiple personalities can be hazardous to your health, especially when you can remember to nuke or melee it to death.<BR>Rolins Starfire, Wood Elven Ranger of the 10th Season<BR>Zbok McMarinn, Barbarian Shaman of the 14th Season<BR>Zanaduu Serenity, High Elven Enchantress of the 14th Circle<BR>Genaeb Tradesmaster, Erudite Magician of the 2nd Circle <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>It won't happen, and if it did the 10 slot backpack would become worthless. Another problem you're not addressing is as soon as they added pelt upgrading people would want silk upgrading too. <P>I'm all for a major tailoring upgrade, but I tend to think allowing the upgrading of materials would ruin tailoring as a viable trade. Converting named pelts sounds reasonable, but I'd rather it downgrade the pelt duing the process. (e.g. grizzly pelt to MQ bear) That would make them useful, as you could then either use it or further downgrade it to make it useful. <P>Ideally, I'd rather see pelt quality partially determined by the skill of whoever killed the mob. It stands to reason that someone who can one hit something and kill it would have a better chance of getting a higher quality pelt than someone who has to hack it to pieces. <P>This isn't currently possible since the mob's contents are determined at spawning instead of death. I dunno how it would work out, as it would probably cause a lot of high level farming and the inevitable arguements about whether a high level player after pelts or a low level player after experience has more right to hunt a preticular mob. <P>Miolnir...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Poison Vials: Well, I don't know much about Rogue Poison.  So I'll leave this alone...<P>People seem to have the idea that Easier == Better.  Tailoring has the unique characteristic that every recipie requires a mob drop.  This is a good thing.  Unlike every other trade skill, I have never seen a Tailoring mule.  It takes time to make a master Tailor.<P>Your 'solution' to this 'problem' would simply make Tailoring just another trade skill.  A matter of a few hours and some plat.  Way to invalidate every master tailors weeks of time they put into becoming master tailors.<P>There are Trappers in the game.  I know many a PC who kills mobs and sells thier pelts.  Oh, you are looking for NPC trappers?  Picky picky.<P>The turning of named pelts into Ruined or LQ sounds reasonable.  But, upgrading pelts is not.  Same reason.  If you patch together pieces of pelt, you get a patchwork pelt.  And guess what?  You can make patchwork armor out of it.  The upgrades wouldn't be that bad if they where of bounded length (ie, the LQ pelts produced by the Ruined couldn't become MQ), _and_ if it was a much higher ratio (like 6 : 1), but as you planned it, it would make a HQ bear pelt a complete joke to get.<P>Do you know why BackPacks command such a high price?  Because in order to make them, you have to spend weeks of time, and lots of plat, becoming a master tailor.  Then and only then you can buy pelts from the Trappers (other PCs), and turn them into something useful.<P>If you haven't noticed, the blacksmithing upgrade has made BSing more like Tailoring, in that the new higher trivial level recipies all require mob drops (with the notable exception of Iksar non-magical cultural, which just confuses me).<P>I think this is a great thing, and I expect this pattern to continue.  Your wish to turn Tailoring into yet another silly skill you can buy will probably never be fullfilled.<P>If you don't like tailoring, please go ahead and not work on it.  I like tailoring.  I hope that furture tailoring improvements follow the same pattern - recipies and recipie values are controlled not by the cost of purchased reagents, but by the difficulty of finding the ingredients.  Hopefully with parallel, not as valueable, just as high trivial level, easier to get stuff to skill up with.  ie, not much harder to do than say fine plate.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

As in real life, the merchants will only have the stuff if someone sells it to them.  Merchants don't trap, trappers aren't merchants.<P>/quote<BR>3) Tailoring relies more heavily on other trades than any other trade in the game, and has very, very little to offer them in return.

I would love to be able to make things that are needed in other trade skills.  Maybe we can come up with some suggestions (other than leather padding).<BR>As an aside, I have only sold about 4 backpacks.  It is not a big money item for me.  I own and use about a dozen, and I use them as gifts (like the friend who gave me a backpack full of page for my enchanter research, the backpack he got back was a 10-slot).<P>/quote<BR>4) It actually makes sense to sew together different pieces of pelts together to make better quality material. It's what people do right now.<P>/comment<BR>Nope.  Not in my RL.  Two tacos from Taco Bell does not equal one taco from Rancho de Chimayo.<P>/quote<BR>5) Every time someone higher level kills off a bear, wolf, or cat, that is one thing that lower level people do not have to hunt. In many cases this actually is KSing. This is something Verant doesn't like, bottom feeding.<P>/comment<BR>This concerns me very much.  I like to try out different classes/races up to lvl 15 or so.  Because the drop rate is based on drops/hour rather than drops/kill, farming for drops hurts the lower level characters.  With the new demand for LQ pelts, I have lost count of the times my lower level characters have been KS'ed.  On the other hand, I see no evidence that Verant disapproves of bottom feeding.  If it took 8 (or 16 or ...) ruined pelts to make a HQ pelt, wouldn't this be more fuel on the fire?  I can just see it, Uberguild  camping of the bears in WC.<P>/quote<BR>As an end result, the trade overall becomes a better skill, more profitable, and produces a wider variety of items, like Verant intended. Yes, you don't get to make as much on HQ Bear pelts, and aww I feel so bad for you.<P>/comment<BR>I wish I knew what Verant intended.  The parting shot undercuts the questions raised.  The farming issue is important.  For the most part, I was able to get experience for the kills that gave me the pelts/skin/silk for my tailoring skill.  More and more, Verant is making the trade skills attainable (and profitable) only by the higher levels, which will make the problem of item-farming worse.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>LOL er, yes, trappers are merchants, thats why they, historically TRAPPED.  Not to make a nice quilt, but to actually sell the pelts.  You know, to people who wanted to buy them so they could make something from the pelts.  Like tailors.<P>And Sckeezix, I hesitated to answer, because your grasp on logic seems tenuous at best, but here goes:<P>The quilt is the end product, not the materials used to produce something.  Raw materials can be combined by someone skillful to produce something more useful, it happens all the time.<P>Saying you can't combine silver to make a gold is foolish, that would be akin to combining cat pelts to make a bear pelt.  You CAN (at least in real life) combine smaller pieces of silver to make a larger piece that is more valuable.  Nice try though.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Backpacks would drop in value is subjective?  Man, you need to look up the definition of subjective.<P>But, I think I get your drift.  You claim that those facts being good or bad are opinions, not hard and fast absolutes.  Yes, good and bad are opinion based.  But, lets apply your criteria to your own reasonings...<P>&lt;QUOTE&gt;<BR>Real arguments for why Verant SHOULD do it:<P>1) Tailoring at present takes hours and hours of real time to produce anything useful and saleable, whereas every other trade skill in the game takes a matter of minutes.<BR>&lt;/QUOTE&gt;<P>Here you go, saying Tailoring's design is bad because it is different than the other trade skills.  The difference being bad your opinion.  However, many master tailors _like_ this tradeskill.  People are proud of being master tailors, _because_ it was so hard.  These two statements are _facts_.<P>Silk thread and Silk Swatches are highly saleable, and doable within seconds of becoming a tailor, btw.<P>&lt;QUOTE&gt;<BR>2) Tailoring at present has no vendors, whereas every other trade skill does, which makes no sense from a Role Play or logic standpoint. There would BE vendors for furs in a world that had demand for them. There would and should BE trappers, not just adventurers, but actual people.<BR>&lt;/QUOTE&gt;<P>Tailoring has partial vendors.  No vendor, or set of vendors, sell complete recipie ingredients, no.<P>Your statement that 'adventurers' are not _actual_ people in this game world is interesting.  Trapping etc was viewed as a very adventurous profession in history, and is even viewed that way today.  So, the real people in this world who are trappers _are_ the PC adventurers.  The only problem is that PCs in this world find it hard to set up shop...  But, you can still buy from them.<P>And yes, you have found another way in which Tailoring is different than other trade skills.  You claim this is a bad thing - this is your opinion.  Your opinion happens to be wrong.  *grin*<P>&lt;QUOTE&gt;<BR>3) Tailoring relies more heavily on other trades than any other trade in the game, and has very, very little to offer them in return. In addition, things like metal boning not being stackable makes the trade prohibitively difficult to produce certain items. Thus, if anyone actually has even one piece of reinforced armor, it is a stunning oddity in the game. This kind of thing would actually make the production of the OTHER products in tailoring (than backpacks, that is) more feasible and useful.<BR>&lt;/QUOTE&gt;<P>Yes, metal boning not being stackable is annoying.  Actually, the fact that both pelts and metal boning are not stackable is the annoying part - I'd be happy with either being stackable!  The dependance is no the problem - you can actually hire a brewer to make 200 HKs, and carry them in the bank.  The problem is some of the dependancies don't stack, requiring you to have a smith present at point of manufacture.<P>&lt;QUOTE&gt;<BR>4) It actually makes sense to sew together different pieces of pelts together to make better quality material. It's what people do right now.<BR>&lt;/QUOTE&gt;<P>People today farm pelts.  All the pelts they farm tend to be High Quality.  Some are of Supreme Quality.  *shrug*.  You don't take a tattered piece of skin and make a leather jacket out of it, tho.<P>&lt;QUOTE&gt;<BR>5) Every time someone higher level kills off a bear, wolf, or cat, that is one thing that lower level people do not have to hunt. In many cases this actually is KSing. This is something Verant doesn't like, bottom feeding.<BR>&lt;/QUOTE&gt;<P>Yep.  The game needs more Dire Wolves, Dire Bears, etc.  Throw some nasty critters around in Kunark that drop Tailorable pelts, so people can hunt at their level.  I've created newbies and leveled them up for a bit, giving them stuff in exchange for the pelts they loot.<P>&lt;QUOTE&gt;<BR>As an end result, the trade overall becomes a better skill, more profitable, and produces a wider variety of items, like Verant intended. Yes, you don't get to make as much on HQ Bear pelts, and aww I feel so bad for you.<BR>&lt;/QUOTE&gt;<P>Better skill?  Naw, easier skill.<P>Wider variety of items?  I'm all for that.  Didn't see any suggestion of new items.  Or, do you mean making some items easier to make?<P>Don't make as much on HQ Bear?  Naw, I don't bother selling those.  By the time I got good enough, I wanted them for myself!  And, the 100 to 200 plat I can get for them is no longer significant.  See, the real problem is that 10 slot containers, as the maximium container size in game, should be expensive.  If they are cheap, they get rid of any value extra inventory space has.  If the code base supported larger containers, I say, make 10 slots common!<P>Your suggestions would invalidate the time put into the skill by all existing tailors, and make becoming a master a joke.  It would provide another skill that just requires an afternoon and some plat to become a master in.  It would move Tailoring to be more like all the tradeskills used to be.<P>Some of your changes I disagree with.  Like, boning being stackable.  I'm gonna go look into the newly stackable studs, and determine if I should start selling some studded to folks...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>LOL tell me this:<P>Was the addition of the skinning knife, which made it possible for you to lower quality of pelts without using them up a bad thing?<P>Has it made leather backing less valuable, do you make less at it than before?  Remember, it is much easier to make now, since you can turn ANY quality of pelt into a leather backing if you have a skinning knife.<P>Did this make tailoring worse?  Did it make tailoring a weaker trade, hurt your pride for having gotten to that level?  Did it ruin the trade by gutting prices?<P>No.  None of these things is true, and it wouldn't be true with increasing quality either, especially considering how many you'd have to use up to make a high quality.  You people really need to take some time and sit back to think about this a while.  The responses are almost comical.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
