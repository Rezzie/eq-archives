</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;There are some tactics that clerics can learn from wizards here too. <P>Absor, there is a HUGE difference between nuking and healing. <P>When you nuke something, sure, you have to consider the aggro, and all that.<P>When healing, do you REALLY want me to hesitate and consider the aggro? Do you really want me to sit there, deciding whether if i heal now it would aggro all the mobs on me? You would be DEAD before i finish considering. Yay.

</FONT><HR>In a normal situation the Changes don't bother me. I just use Celestial and Divine line of spells now. No biggie there.<P>However Plane raids and Mob boss raids will almost be impossible now or require 15-20 clerics to complete.<P>Healing now more so than in the past puts you on the hate list of all mobs engaged. In places like PoH Sebilis and chardok this can get interesting. U ever try to mez a Cleric in PoH ?<P>I can't even friendly heal someone who isnt in my group anymore. Seems anytime he attacks something it comes straight for me instead of the person who attacks it. I don't know maybe that was a one time thing or some kind of glitch.<P>I think the caps on 51 plus mobs need to be adjusted some.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yeah, I like how he responded to the post that wasn't against the patch, too.  Maybe then people will figure out the concept of positive reinforcement.<P>Frankly, this is all ridiculous.  I haven't been able to play lately because my computer is all messed up, so I haven't tried the changes... but with the number of people who have posted that "I haven't tried it because it's terrible and I don't want to die" I basically have turned a deaf ear to those complaining about the change.  I can't imagine it could possibly be as bad as they make it out to be.<P>Absor, I like what you said about the monsters learning and adapting.  Perhaps you guys would have more fun writing the patch messages if you did them in a more RP style, and put things in this context.  So, instead of saying "we've changed the way healing aggro works," which is clearly coming from Verant, say "The monsters across Norrath have been watching how you fight, and have learned something.  They have realized that if someone heals their attacker, they are more likely to die, and so they should be more inclined to attack these healers, especially if they're healing a great deal at one time..." blah blah.  Give all the same info, but in story form, instead of it being something that Verant did.<P>Just an idea.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My experiences...<P>Logged in after patch.  A monk friend needed help killing Trun in Durga.  We had killed him twice before in the past week and knew we could do him with our current, albiet unbalanced, group.<P>3 54+ monks<BR>1 60 enchanter<BR>1 53 cleric<BR>1 52 warrior (only taunter)<P>Trunt is 55 (I think) he hits fairly hard and is very do-able with one group.  Our strategy was let the warrior tank, have the cleric use complete heal on the warrior.  If the monks got hit they should back off so that the cleric would only need to heal the warrior.<P>First part of battle went fine.  Warrior was taking all the damage as his hit points slowly went down.  The cleric cast complete heal.  Trunt turns to the cleric.  The warrior could not get Trunt of of the cleric, so she died.<P>Well amazingly Trunt died and just the warrior and monk (the one that need the epic piece) lived.<P>My point is:<P>Encounters on mobs that are 55+ will now require more then one group (a raid) to insure that you do not get slaughtered.  Raids are fun if you are the group that gets the exp or the person that gets the item.  I hate raids.<P>Reduce the taunt of a complete heal.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>/quote<BR>And therein lies the problem. <P>Far too many people are not trying the new changes out. <BR>/endquote<P><BR>*I am not a cleric, but I have been in groups where this new change was tried out.  To put it bluntly, I logged off and canceled my account afterwards.  The change makes the post 50 game unplayable for the average player.<P><BR>/quote<BR>I hate to do this, but let's look at the Evade. Some Rogues were convinced that the changes we made to Evade were going to make them worthless, long before they had a chance to play with it. 'One backstab and die'. It turns out that they are, if not excited about the change, accepting of it. But only now that they've actually played with it. <BR>/endquote<P><BR>* Rogues can still control their agro; however clerics cannot.  A cleric MUST heal, a rough can choose to backstab or not, and can choose to back off or not.  Comparting the rogue nerf tot he cleric nerf is unreasonable.<P><BR>/quote<BR>Please, play the game. See what we've done. We want feedback from people that have tried it out. You do yourself and your fellow players a disservice with posts like this. <BR>/endquote<P><BR>* I have played the game, I am a level 53 warrior on one account and a level 53 paladin on another.  I watched 6 clerics die in 20 seconds on the second island of sky with 12 tanks doing EVERYTHING they could to taunt them off the clerics.  They died, we died, we summoned and logged.<P>/quote<BR>Thanks to those of you that have played with the changes. <BR>/endquote<P><BR>* I thank those players that are refusing to play with these changes.  It is only but players canceling our accounts that you will listen to us verant.  Until Wednesday, I was THOURGHLY enjoying EQ.  I was about to form a new guild; but after playing and dieing Wednesday from this short sighted quick fix, I canceled my account Thursday.<P><BR>/quote<BR>As you continue to play with them, and as your tactics evolve (and we know that you'll find good ones), let's talk about the effects of this change.<BR>/endquote<P>Yes, lets talk about this.  FoH and Afterlife (the 2 guilds you seem to shadow the most at verant) probably already have a set of tactics for this.  I would bet they would consist of USING the unstoppable agro in conjunction with divine aura to prevent a large raid from taking damage.  Even a small group of 2 clerics, 2 rogues, a bard and an enchanter can now NEVER take one point of damage.(Clerics ping pong, bard/chanter provide mana, and rogues do all the damage.)<P>Is that what you wanted?  Now instead of 1 cleric being required in a group 2 are.  Instead of a warrior and a rogue in a group, they need 2 rogues.<P>This short sighted change will create groups that 80% of players will not be welcome in.  This instant complete taunt will force guilds to use it and exploit it.  <P>FoH and afterlife among others easily be able to adapt, but guilds that do not have a surplus of clerics will not.  Those players will be quitting EQ because they CANNOT get groups now.  It was bad enough before where warriors, clerics and enchanters were the only ones wanted, but now its even more limited in who will fit in a group.<P>I URGE you to undo this before it is too late.  Please, don't take this as a higher ground arguement - the game will not be fun for most players after this change.  <P>Don't meet us half way, apologise and delete the code you changed.  My $20 might not mean much to you, but I won't be the only one.  (Again I am NOT a cleric - I am somone who is unwilling to watch clerics die.)<P>Complete heal cannot be changed. Its too late. Verant should never have made it, but you did.  LIVE WITH IT - because we WON'T live with this NERF.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The cleric in the pull team was getting owned because at times he had to cheal the puller, a lvl 60 warrior, and he would for the next 5 minutes and through DA, have mobs on him.<P>I think furor put it most accuratly when he said, the scenario of a level 60 warrior with the best equipment and best weapons in the game, can not taunt off a frekin mob from his cleric, is about as idiotic and ludicruse (sp) as you can get.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have played since the patch, and it sucks, to be quite frank.  This, coupled with the lower taunting of Warrior weapons, ends up with me tanking mobs for 20-30 seconds before they can be taunted off of me, after one complete heal.  This is with a level 60 warrior, level 55 rogue, and level 55 enchanter (I'm a level 57 cleric).<P>Example.  We were playing in Howling stones, doing our usual thing.  Controlled pull, nothing we can't handle.  I do one CH, and the mob that our warrior has been fighting for the past 45 seconds immediately sticks onto me.  We're all fully buffed as I can buff; that puts me 'round 2800 hps.  I was at 1200 hps before it was taunted off me.<P>And, no, I wasn't running around.  I was calmly standing still, moving back a little every so often to see if the mob had been successfully taunted off me.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Verant says that the changes that were made are really only affecting the high end part of the game, a very small portion of the game significantly. <P>Excuse me, but isn't fighting Dragons and Gods and Big Boss Mojo's like Velketor and Veeshan's Peak why you wanted to play the game in the first place? To be part of the adventure of taking down a great evil across the land, akin to Smaug from the Hobbit? Or fighting things like Ishmael or Lanfear from the Robert Jordan books? To feel a part of something EPIC! That's why I play. It isn't just about the Phat Lewtz (though I certainly like getting nice items), it's about feeling that rush as the dragon roars and laughing in its face. It's about firing the arrow that finds the weak spot in Smaug's armour and pierces his heart. <P>If these encounters are broken, whether or not they are a large percentage of the encounters in-game, then you are breaking the whole reason for people playing the game in the first place. I didn't pick up Everquest so I could kill RATS for 10 hours straight just to get from 1st to 3rd level, I picked it up to be a tough, mean, well-armoured, sword-wielding maniac killing the baddest evil thing I could. And fulfilling that quest that drops the one true ring in the lava. <P>At 40th level, I've already noticed that there are some mobs I just can't taunt off of the group's enchanter or cleric or ranger for that matter. The Taunt skill is not strong enough at the higher levels and NOW you make necessary heals the most powerful aggro factor in the game. That's wrong. Clerics and healing weren't broken and no matter what you say you will not be able to convince me of that. No, I shouldn't be able to control a mob's aggro completely as a warrior, but I ought to at least be able to get one or two token hits on me instead of on my soon to be dead cleric. <P>Wake up guys, test these things THOUROUGHLY BEFORE YOU PUT THEM ON THE LIVE SERVERS.

</FONT><HR>i take back everything i said about it not being so bad for clerics (im a bard btw)<BR>tonight while in icewell  we were gonna attempt the Dain....well for those of you who dont know, his guards hit pretty darn hard and are virtually totally MR, means no mez, no root, just pure brute force....we had the people to do the job...the only problem is that as soon as our poor clerics tried to do their job and heal the tanks (or anyone else for that matter) they got beat on badly, and in most cases totally annihilated before they could get DB/DA up (well part of it  was that screwy lag weve been having since the patch, but thats another rant)....we had more clerics die than tanks due to this new and improved agro from CH.....somehow i fail to see how this is balanced when the clerics get wiped out before the tanks can retaunt<P>on a related note the tanks could NOT taunt the mobs off the healers, especially the clerics, now first let me explain that we have some awesome clerics and tanks in our guild not just my opinion, but its the general consensus on the server as to how skilled these players are, they know what they are doing and know how to play the game....if this is not an indication that the agro was increased too much, then ii dont know what is......i think the clerics understand that something needed to be done, but in this case i think the solution was overdone and the agro might need to be tweaked a bit</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>*laughing*<P>I want to keep faith in you Absor, I really do.  I don't want to think about how bad it was before you started at Verant, about how I quit EQ over one of your predecessor's posts, how I just felt that Verant collectively needed to grow up.  I came back because I thought you "got it", that you KNEW EverQuest.<P>Do me a favor, please.  Please go to Test, create a 52 Cleric with a 183 WIS and an AC of about 800 wearing random pieces of Ry'Gorr's, Ethereal Mist, and JBoots.<P>Get in a raid to PoG.  Pretend that this new character of yours is actually yours, that you've invested hundreds of hours learning a style of play, that your reputation is great - try to place yourself in our shoes.  Get into a group with a Bard, and Enchanter, Two Warriors, and an SK.<P>Now keep them alive.<P>It's bad enough that after 52 Clerics become boring, but this is insult to injury.  I know Verant did this to make the class interesting and spread healing across al classes that can heal - that's evident with giving Druids and Shamen Chloroblast.  What you do not understand is that these changes have wrecked my playstyle, the exp bar is moving to the left now, and most of all this makes EverQuest just not fun anymore.<P>Why?  Can you possibly understand how terrible it feels to die on the first pull, knowing that the rest of your party is going to all die too?  This is not a FUN feeling.  We didn't have this issue when we pulled BEFORE this nerf, and now all of us - my entire GROUP has to adjust to this change?  This is way way beyond nerfing an item when it affects everyone empirically.<P>Sure, you can pick out the one little post on this board that thinks these changes are not significant and respond to it - give it attention, give it credence.  There's a big difference between how this nerf works in Lower Guk and Velious.  It's ridiculous.<P>I will not play my Cleric again until this is changed - I don't want to suffer the experience loss.  I was the first 50 Cleric on Quellious, and I'm telling you that this change is much much more drastic to Velious subscribers than you appear to understand.<P>It was boring to sit, med, heal, res playing a Cleric before, but now it just seems retarded with certain death as the penalty tossed into the mix.  The Cleric class is a cornerstone of EQ.  I'm sad to learn that Verant would go so far as to disturb that.<P>V</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I hate to say it but the whiney clerics out there REALLY need to start asking say....WIZARDS how we deal with aggro.  Sure its incredibly easy for us on ANY level encounter to over-burn and aggro the crap outta something.  <P>I dont know if any of you remember but when the resistance level cap went in I distinctly remember dying repeatedly in Mistmoore.... Until I figured out what the problem was (resist = more aggro then usual).  After that I was fine.<P>Seems to me that alot of clerics have this mental block against using ANYTHING but CH in a battle.  Well the equivalent would be a wizard ONLY wanting to EVER use Ice Comet or Sunstrike (big damage big aggro spells).  Now any wizard worth his/her salt is NOT gonna do this because they KNOW that the aggro generated by this sort of a lead will cause them, and their group, to wind up dead and lookin fer a rez.<P>Harkening back to the implementation of the resist cap I can recall NUMEROUS wizards/casters whining about very similar problems.  eg I cant nuke or I die horribly.  Fortunately many many casters managed somehow to adapt.  Clerics of will manage to do the same I'm sure.<P>And btw it IS possible for (with the except of epic uber unreal hp mobs) a Wizard to do large amounts of sustained damage.  Its a matter of playing SMART versus clicking spell icons and hoping.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>You talk about us trying it out.  I'm a lvl 54 cleric and have played basically nothing but a cleric since the very first day the game was released.<P>Last night I died 4 ... FOUR ... times in a matter of only a few hours from healing. (all in the Eastern Wastes)<P>1st time was in a group with just me and my husband (he's a lvl 55 rogue) while fighting an orc ... ONE ORC!!<P>My husband had it down to half health .. I CH'd him and BOOM .. the ONE ORC was all over me ... my husband got in TWO BACKSTABS on it while it beat the crap out of me ... and did that taunt it off ... NO! ... I died.<P>A little later that same night a ranger friend joined us to fight a few of the wandering giants.  Needless to say I died while trying to keep the two of them alive when I did a REMEDY on the ranger ... REMEDY ... not a CH but a tiny heal!<P>The ranger and the rogue had this particular giant down to half health ... I cast TWO REMEDY spells .. one on the ranger .. one on the rogue and BOOOM ... the giant decides to kill me.<P>A little later .. a druid friend joins us .. this was great fun because she could now heal too .. guess what ... Druid and Cleric DEAD from healing.<P>Same thing happened a little later as well .. only this time from a CH I cast on the ranger.  Great fun night .. sorry, it's no fun even if I can rez myself.<P>I've yet to venture even near a dungeon.  Frankly I'm afraid to and after two years of being a cleric I'm frankly considering hanging it up.<P>I buff .. I heal ..

</FONT><HR>Hmmmm... and I thought Warriors were the only ones they completely ignored.  Wow, I feel much better now.<P>...AND CLERICS ARE HEALERS, NOT NUKERS!  Quit trying to compare them already!<P>I DID buy this game to be challanged and for a changing world, but not to have the game changed on me.  The 'changing world' comes through levels and exploration.  The challange comes from higher level MOBs who behave differently.  No need to keep changing things around all the time.  The game is quite challanging enough.<P>One other thing I don't quite understand.  Here you were asking for input from the classes on what needed to be improved.  I know for a fact that many Warriors posted that they were having problems with taunt (I'm not talking about the level 30 uber-twink with Wurmslayer and an FBSS, either).  I myself have trouble taunting after heals and sometimes mezzes (or just when some silly necro casts whatever spell they keep using that aggroes the @#$% out of everything).  Yet, dispite this, you nerf Warrior taunting (procs) and at the same time, increase aggro on Heals?  Were you asking simply to find the best way to irritate everyone?  Did you have a complete brain collapse?  Seems to me that not only did you not help either of the classes, you made the situation even worse.  This is called Balancing?  Don't worry, next time you ask we will just tell you that everything is peachy.  Don't expect any more player input if this is how you use it.<P>Sincerely,<BR>   1DisgruntledWarrior</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The patch has turned clerics into nothing but rezz machines. Truthfully, a druid or shaman can heal well enough in a high level group to not even need the healing abilities of a cleric -- unless an experience rezz is needed. Sure, our buffs are nice, but shaman provide great buffs too. Dungeon groups don't really need a cleric now -- if someone dies and you need to get them back to the group, just have your group wizard CoH them. Have a high level pally in the group or a necro and you can get exp rezz anyway. I created my clerics because I saw a serious lack of them out there and I wanted to be more helpful to the groups I was in; I was so happy to hit level 53 and finally have enough mana to efficiently heal, buff and stun. I felt the aggro on heals was bad enough before the patch--just heal your incoming tank in Karnors and see who the dogs attack! I've noticed more down time since the patch too -- rather than healing during the battle and medding up before the next pull, I now wait til the end of the battle and then the group waits for me to med again. The patch has forced me to reconsider the group makeup -- now you need to be tank heavy (more taunters), have a palain to spell-taunt the mob, must have a backup healer (cleric can't heal tank while she is being pounded), enchanters are vital to mezz the mob off the cleric, and you need a wizard to CoH the dead cleric back to the group. I don't think the tanks and other group members appreciate the added risk they now take because their cleric is unable to heal them when she is under attack or dead. Verant, what were you thinking? We told you playing clerics was boring and stressful, we asked for spells to make us more useful to our groups, and instead you put out a patch that clearly insults the cleric community. You could have given us some small bone to offset the nerf you were planning, but instead you just made our job more stressful and unrewarding. Thanks a lot.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I just love how all the Clerics who are saying that they have no problems with this change always have two things in common.<P>1.  They always indicate that they have a high level Enchanter with them.<P>2.  They are always hunting in a location in Norrath that crowed control is a viable option.<P>What they fail to understand is that not all hunting areas in Norrath have crowd control as a viable option IE SoV.  Secondly, there are not enough Enchanters to have for every group.  So if there are no Enchanters available you will not be hunting in places like OS and KC as if you have more then one mob pulled with no means of CC then the AoE taunt affect for CH will get you killed every time.  Sure if you are only taking on one mob at a time you will do just fine.  Hope you always have an Enchanter in your back pocket and don't even think about going on the Ultra high level encounters.

You guys at Verant might want to start programming more tactical encounters instead of NERFING SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN THE STANDARD FOR TWO YEARS. (So when does Lich get the knife, huh?)<P>One of the reason people are complaining so hard is because you just changed the game's mechanics that have been reliable for two years. Bravo. Oh, and with all that warning too. Abashi mutters something about a small group of people whining CH is too powerful, then OUT OF THE BLUE (really, a warning would have been DECENT of you there at Verant, yes we the customers are intelligent and like to be kept up on what you're going to fubar next!) we get game mechanics that have been reliable for two years changed.<P>Next thing you know 2Handers will provide better damage/taunt than 1Handers. *laugh* Maybe I can sell my Shieldstorm off my twink warrior ... 2K is it's going rate on my server.<P>- Gaeb<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think the problem with this aggro change is that different people who are playing with it are seeing quite different things.<P>I (52nd level cleric) have been playing with the aggro change for three days now.  I've been fighting in Sebilis and Chardok.  Our pulls have been multiple blue through yellow cons (so mobs between 48th and 53rd level).  Aggro is a bit different: I have to time my heals a little.  But the change is by no means severe under these conditions.  I've been in several instances where, without an enchanter and with multiple mobs handled purely through meleer taunting, I've had to dump several back to back heals including multiple complete heals.  This is ideal aggro generating circumstances.  Yet I survived, and was able to do what needed to be done.  I remember day one of the change people were reporting insta-death under these circumstances: obviously, that is not quite true.<P>I will be playing in Chardok on an Overking/Queen raid tomorrow.  That is about as "uber" a situation as I normally get in.  I'll report back my findings then, but I'm expecting some problems.<P>I don't play with the real "uber" mobs.  The critters with 200k hitpoints.  Personally, I think there is where the real problems will lie.  To be frank, however, in my opinion Verant screwed up royally by *creating* such monsters in the first place.  They exist exclusively for the less than 1% of gamers who are members of real Uber guilds like FoH.  And in some cases those mobs have been custom designed to deal with very specific tactics relating to particular items or spells (E.G.: the Donal's BP).  In my mind, such "monty haul" mobs bespeak a very poor design philosophy.  Adjusting any aspect of the game in a way that impacts all players to deal with the tactics (nee "exploits") of less than 1% of the gaming population is defective thinking as far as I'm concerned.  But, that's just me.<P>I suspect (yet to be tested) that the monster aggro on clerical heal can be managed for the types of monsters "normal" people deal with, up to and including mobs like the Overking and Queen.  And the Uber guilds will come up with a "tactic" to deal with their particular problems on the real "uber" mobs, and probably even take advantage of it.  <P>Paeter</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>heres what ive noticed:<P>1) when an you heal anyone on a mobs hate list..you build up hate for that mob...now more than before.  When an enchanter mezzes a mob, it sits there gaining no hate for anyone but the cleric who is healing everyone on its hate list.  SOOO when the mez breaks, it goes to the cleric instead of the chanter.  Maybe you should make it so mezzed mobs dont gain hate ONCE they are mezzed (in other words, mezzing still gains hate, but once the mezz is in place they dont gain hate until after the mez breaks).<P>2) on long pulls with a monk, the monk tends to be low on hp when it actually arrives at the group, and needs a heal.  The monk hasnt done much to actually aggro the mob on the way, so if you heal the monk as hes in the group, the mob comes straight to you.  Now in the plane of hate, or fear or such where the monk just stays down after the pull until hes ready to pull again, thats no problem.  But in like Karnors moat groups, sometimes those are LONG pulls for the monk.  solution to this?  better healing tactics i suppose on the clerics part<P>btw, im a level 52 cleric</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>After some thought...<P>This nerf (and all nerfs most likely) are a result of demographics.<P>The dev team (lead by Abashi/Absor) had a meeting and gathered this info/made these determinations:<P>We lost 15% of our subscribership last month, so we have to do something drastic to keep people playing.<P>We know our AI is constantly being defeated by these "smart" players and players are levelling too fast.  We don't have the money, time, resources, incentive or creativity available or allocated to recode/reprogram the AI to make it better.  SO, time to break out the nerfbat.  Someone's gonna get nerfed...the players need to be weakened and die more often to make the AI look better and more challenging.<P>Here is what we will do.  Evaluate the following:<P>1. Druid class<BR>2. Shaman class<BR>3. Cleric class<P>The Druid AND Shaman class comprise 30%+ of the entire user population.  The cleric class only 10% if that.<P>The choice to "nerf" was obvious.  "Upset" (quoted from Abashi) the smaller number of players and keep the larger number happy - give the 30% new spells/abilities upgrades, reduced agro factor etc etc. make them really happy.  Chop off the proverbial "legs" from the 10% Clerics and give them nothing.  Claim it is a grand "experiment" to see how you react and deal with it to make them feel better.  Tell them that maybe at some point in the future, we may do "something" but don't specify what that may be.<P>Result: 25-50% of the total EQ Cleric population quits EQ.  The other 25-50% may restrict their playtime/not group or just continue playing like loyal/good little nerfees.  The other priests will "pick up" the slack where the Clerical "hole" is (quoted from Abashi).<P>We then search for a messageboard thread (that we most likely created) from a satisfied nerfee and post in it that "we are happy with the changes, and you will be too" (quoted from Absor) etc etc.<P>This is Verant's logic.<P>Enjoy the bones they throw you today, because tomorrow they'll chop off your leg (or someone elses, but we WILL get to you) to "retune" "enhance" "rebalance" the game and then say "we are happy with the changes, you will be too" (quoted from Absor).<P>I am not a guinea pig, a lab rat or a beta tester for VI's whims.  It's not my fault they have no creativity, misallocated funds, poor management or whatever makes them thoughtlessly nerf.  I play a cleric.  I heal people, rez people and keep people alive, keep them happy and healthy in the game.  Clerics are by design, a group only class.  By design, we have the best, most efficient heals.  By design, we are all about efficiency and healing.  By design, for years, we did our jobs well.  Clerics are the most selfless class in this otherwise selfish, item farming, soloing game.<P>Apparently, this is perpetuated by an equally selfish dev team. <P>Enjoy your "success" while it lasts.  This post does NOT require any response from Absor or Abashi.  Responses from them are not for debate and are one sided in the extreme.  I'm sure they will pull out the "well, EQ is about the bottom line and making money, if we have to chase some customers away to keep the majority, so be it" line.  Well, good for you.  Eventually, logic dictates that you'll chase away so many paying customers that the majority won't be major anymore and you'll be out of a job.<P>I was "chased away" from the Wizard class by nerfs like this.  I did what any good "nerfee" is supposed to do when dissatisfied with a class.  I started another class (timesink).  I will not be "chased" from class to class trying to figure out which one will "be fun" at higher levels before its nerfed, then restart again.  Oh, I started chanter too, but I have no desire to play anymore.<P>I see people posting things like "Clerics wanted to be the best healers...make them pay! HAHAHA!"  Um, no, we didn't "want" anything, we have what we have BY DESIGN, same with you.  We keep your sorry behind alive and then you stab us in the back for being selfless and efficient.  We pay countless PP for jaspers and peridots (out of our own pockets because godforbid you would reimburse us for it) to keep you alive.  We rez you and restore lost hours/days/weeks of your TIME for you based on what we have to go through to get to that point (usually means dealing/grouping with people like you).  You claim we have a healing monopoly.  We only have what is by game design as it has been for years.  ALL we have is heals and HP buffs in combat.  Everything else we have is shared...and so are the heals.  You can't use heals to solo btw for those of you who say we should or can solo.<P>AAah..that felt good to get off my chest.<P>Thx info.<P>"All your greed are belong to us"<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
