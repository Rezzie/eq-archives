</FONT><HR>They should just change things as they see appropriate. They should have invested the time and energy they put into these boards to have more people test the game actually IN-GAME.<BR>It is THEIR game, they can make the rules however they want. Allowing the player base a forum to vent and suggest changes has actually decreased customer satisfaction. It looks good on paper, and is a tremendous effort to keep communication open, but it has been a failure. Yeah, they probably gleaned a little useful info off of these boards. But has it been worth the headaches? Have they gotten the return on the investment? NOW the customers perceive it is their RIGHT to mandate changes to VERANT's product. Of course we can just stop playing. If they never would have opened up this can of worms, players would just....PLAY. Of course we would get angry over issues or changes, but an open forum such as this amplifies dissatisfaction.<BR>I know it is not quite right to compare other traditional games to EQ, but have you ever heard of a game or product manufacturer that goes through so much effort to solicit customer input? And 99% of these posts are negativem it seems.<BR>I appreciate the effort, and I can imagine the meetings when they decided these boards were a good idea.<BR>"Yes Alan, we will have a whole site dedicated to hearing our customer, and responding to their needs on an ongoing basis! Johnson, you work with Bradley and design it. That is the key to a long lasting MMPRPG people, real time customer feedback."<BR>Maybe it has helped EQ to last longer. EQ has lasted a long time, and I bet will last a few years more. But they also have learned some very important lessons.<BR>First, the majority of people in the world are selfish morons who are unable to see past the tip of their nose.<BR>Second, soliciting input from this majority is a BIG DRAG and largely pointless. They end up spending days and hours and hours sifting through the unending load of crap and looking for a little gold.<BR>And third, message board detail is NOT a fun assignment, but great for shuffling some poor schmuck into the limelight for 15 minutes. Wonder if just prior to reassigment here the next 'victim board moderator' goes home to his/her spouse all excited about their 'big break'? "Honey, this is big time, I am on the front line between our cutomers and the company. Man, I cant wait until Monday...this will really look good on a resume...I am really gonna change things there too"<P>Like I said the effort is appreciated, but the resource committment is misplaced.<P>&lt;same board moderator two weeks later&gt;<BR>"Honey, nothing is WRONG, I just hate that place. I have been listening to people whine and cry all day on that @#$@ board, I dont need you whining now when I get home..." </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, all sarcasm aside.<P>This has grown too big!  Often I will see a very good idea immediately hit page 3 in twenty minutes.  It's gone forever.  The person who writes it either has to self bump it or figure that somebody doesn't care.<P>The problem is that one person cannot possibly respond to everything.  I see Absor write pages and pages in a response and I know it took him at least a half an hour to get it done.  Meanwhile fifty new threads have started and maybe two or three have any real merit.<P>The only solution is to have Absor lurk and make suggestions to the team as he see fit.  Hiring more people to respond to this would just cause it to mushroom into something even more huge than it is.<P>If this board were like the bug board, it would work (and it does).  That board does not see nearly the volume this one does.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Heres some discussion Brad.<P>How about you actually POST about what you see on the boards?<P>Half of the problem is that you respond ONCE to a thread, then ignore it. I would be surprised if you came back to even this thread and responded to anyone else.<P>You see a dozen threads on the cleric nerf issue. Why not post something to it. Be an active member. Apparently, you need more than one Absor. He is 100X better than Abashi, but he is overwhelmed with what the task his job would be. Perhaps he needs an assistant?<P>There are class talk threads. The problem with them is the lack of responses. It causes people to get frustrated. Frustration leads to anger at the people that can alleviate that frustration but seemingly don't care by sheer lack of responses.<P>The one that REALLY gets us baked is when they post under topics like Part Two (Part Six) by GrollerDaBard.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This message board is a good idea in theory. The main problem is with the many people that decide to post their difficulties here, especially when they cannot get through to the CS Phone Line. That results in the repeating of posts stating the same problem. The other problem is people replying to those posts. Some are objective and try to assist, others do not. I myself am guilty of both things, so I wanted to say that before the "Flame-Fest" begins. A good idea would be to add additional support lines so that people can actually get through, without having to make a long distance phone call and be put on hold for up to 5 minutes before being told "Please try again later, we are experiencing high call volume. That really infuriates people calling to find out why they were suspended, and then they vent their rage in here. Another point to make, change your e-mail responses to soething that will actually help the person, not e-mails advertising the latest and greatest thing coming out, with only one sentence stating to call 1-888-THESTATION. A lot of times people call that number to be told "We cannot help you, contact your server GM" or some other such drivel. Now that I have had my say, I shall step down off of my soapbox and return you to your regularly scheduled message board.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Very interesting perspective indeed, Manglosh.<P>The only other MMORPG I have suffiecient experience (for comparative purposes) with was a text MUD I played a few years ago.<P>It, like EQ, had a very devoted (ok - perhaps I should have said "fanatical") player base. We players would often meet and socialize in our off-time. There were more than a few individuals who "powered", playing 16-20 or more hours EVERY DAY of the month. (My personal record for a day played was 16 hours...can you say "ADDICT"?)<P>In fact, it was because the gameplay mechanics were so similar to EQ (aside from the lack of graphics), that I originally decided to try playing Verant's game.<P>Due to the many similarities, I fell in love with the lands of Norrath and have been an "EQ-junkie" ever since.<P>The company who created my text-MUD was eventually purchased by a larger gaming company, but prior to this they utilized the same format that Verant uses here now. We had forums where we could discuss changes made to the game. Those forums were nowhere near as chaotic as the boards here, but they were an important method of gathering information. The designers realized that if they did not have constant feedback from their clientele they would be unable to give their playerbase what it needed to continue to thrive and grow.<P>Realistically, these boards are the only thing that keeps me in the game. <P>If I were to just "log-in" to extensive changes in gameplay (without having access to a form of feedback like these boards provide) I would probably log off in frustration and cancel my account in a fit of pique.<P>As much as these boards may be a "pain in the @$$" to monitor, they provide a release to the player populace. Even if the problems are not answered, even if it takes us forever (at times) to get a response, these boards provide an outlet where players can vent their anger when needed.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

So many people complain and complain.  No ONE ever says anything positive.  That's me included.  <P>This is how it started for me.  I never read this board.  Ever.  But I looked at it one time, and then kind of enjoyed it.  People would say things and maybe get a response.  Okay, that's cool.  But ever since the RoK expansion, this is a negativity fest.  I got caught up in it.  A lot of other people did, too.  Almost everyone who was fed up with the game would post their feelings here.  <BR>Sure, in retrospect I wish I'd have been a little more positve, but what can you do?

</FONT><HR>  Verant pioneered (sp?) something that VERY few gaming companies do with their customer interaction.  There are many things in the game that have been added/changed because people wanted it that way.  Unfortunately, this causes unbalancing feelings (like "Verant listens to Class_A, but they don't to Class_B so they must hate us.)  I do agree with the original poster.  If Verant had never given us a "voice" to speak to them, there would be a lot less whining and anti-Verant attitudes, because people would never feel like they were being "ignored."  <P>  The catch is this:  EQ is an ever-changing environment.  One could even say that it would be ludicrous to make changes to the game without input from it's citizens (the players).  However, I do kind of wish Verant would put more resources, training, time (what have you) into their in-game staff.  That way they would know first hand what is really going on with the game mechanics (as to what needs fixed/left alone, etc.)<P>  I must say that I GREATLY appriciate everything that Absor, Abashi and the rest of the gang have done to keep us players "in the know."  For instance, Absor's Class Talks were excellent.  They told players directly what would be looked at for each class.  However, if I had my say in how Verant would do things (if it was my company), I would evolve it into something like this:<P> * Less interaction on these boards - 99% of the posts are just frustrated players letting off steam.  <P> * MORE (much more) put into In-Game staff - I would have stricter supervision of GM's/Guides.

Now Verant's removed the negative faction hit for doing Barbarian Shaman and Warrior quests. And I've recently noticed that Verant has added a number of Barbarian Rogue quests to the game.<P>Without player feedback, would anyone at Verant have even realized that there were no quests a Barbarian Rogue could do in Halas without losing faction in their own guild?

</FONT><HR>Tyronnax brings up a good point.<P>There is some well-earned frustration relating to 888-STATION.  I hope that Verant is obtaining call volume information from telco and looking into a solution.  It seems clear that:<P>- The current number of lines is entirely inadequate; busy signals are common.<P>- The PBX software or hardware is inadequate; calls are not queued, but instead you get a recording which says "we are currently experiencing heavy call volume" and then instructs us to use internet-based resources to resolve issues.  Then it hangs up.  This is particularly disturbing given that people are often told on the boards and in email that they can only resolve their issue by calling the 888 number.<P>- The staffing is probably also inadequate.  Certainly expanded hours would better server *all* of your customers, not just those in other time zones.  I live in the Pacific time zone, but if I needed to call 888-STATION, I would have to do so before work in the morning (and hope it took less than 45 minutes) or during my lunch break.  But beyond that, increasing the phone lines and the queueing will not serve more people faster unless there are also more people to answer the calls.<P>The 888 number seems to be a bottleneck in the current CS system.  While I'm sure that telco would love to sell, er, talk to you about solutions, it may be that those solutions have been researched and they are not cost-effective.  However, if this is the case, better management of the current system is in order.  A couple suggestions:<P>- Overhaul the Kana database, and add a tag to auto-generated responses that *says* they are auto-generated.  It is obvious to those who know that the software exists, but for those that don't it looks like someone doing a half-a**ed job of reading.<P>- Create a simple "troubleshooter" on the tech support web form.  Determine in general what kind of problem people are having, and then prompt them to create/upload the necessary files.  Currently, if you fill out this web form, you get:<BR>-- in 24 hours, an automated response, confirming that they recieved your message.<BR>-- in about three days, a request for dxdiag, eqinfo, and dbg files.<P>If people started off by sending these files, the techs could initiate contact with proposed solutions or more specific requests.<P>- End the cycle of sending people back and forth between the website and the 888 number.  Either change the referral recording to something like "www.everquest.com contains many helpful resources for new players and people experiencing technical problems; it makes a great first stop.  Billing questions cannot be handled over the internet."<P>- Maybe implement a secure system where billing inquiries *can* be handled over the internet.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wow, too wierd, my wife and I were having this exact conversation on the way home from work tonight (yes, we both play). We decided that the major problem with EQ/Verant is communications related, and this board is one of the biggest problems. We can not fathom why a company would allow such negative feedback to foster and grow on one of their own resources.<P>I am sure these boards only represent a small amount of the actual playerbase, unfortunately it is a very vocal minority. I am not saying that issues/ideas generated here do not reflect the general player feeling about things, but it does appear that even small issues get blown WAY out of purportion here.<P>My suggestion would be to close these boards and actually chat with real players that provide a realistic cross section of the playerbase. ie: a purportional amount of each class and a purportional amount of each type of player (complete powergamer, plays alot but not uber-guilded, casual and also the RPers. I think this would help to actually make the game more "friendly" to the majority of players.<P>(I say this because I am under the impression, because FoH says it all the time, that Verant pretty much only consults them about changes and possible enhancements)<P>Just do not put out a call for volenteers, ask people in game that the GM's have had good interactions with if they might consider helping.<P>You might also want to do a one time good deal and allow people to move their characters to test. I know that I would seriously consider moving our accounts over (all levels 52+) if it would help to improve the game. Just do not wipe them please, would be all I ask. This might help to get things better tested.<P>Anyways, I got off topic, but if I ran Verant I would shut down these boards. With them gone people will migrate to other boards they feel comfortable on, generally the nice boards and not the flame-play ones. People post here only because its your boards.<P>The Rangers Glade is a perfect example, if you want good input, just go look at what they talk about without letting them know you are there.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree with Manglosh to a point.<P>I think Verant absolutely NEEDS these kinds of board to make their product successful.<P>The problem is, this being an Official Game board gives them the problem.<P>This is what I would have suggested: (I am a consultant in RL)<P>They should have had no Official Boards ever.  After the first month of the game, many fan sites would have opened up, and most would have message boards.<P>All they would have to do is read these boards' messages and get their input that way.  There would be less finger pointing and class mongering had it happened this way.<P>They could even participate as a user (with identity a secret of course) just to further some conversations along.<P>Once in a while when they were going to make major changes (Like the exp thing) just write an article or interview with one of the sites.<P>I think it would have had a much bigger impact done this way and Verant would have come off much better in the end.<P>But, live and learn.  Just as they have learned to program an MMORPG better now, next release of a game they might do it the way I suggested.<P>This is a great topic and a refreshing change.<P>Dexx</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;"They should have invested the time and energy they put into these boards to have more people test the game actually IN-GAME."<P>I agree.  Shut down the board and implement a dynamic / interactive polling system in the game or at login.  Give players the option to "turn on or off" these polls however, don't force it down their throats.  You already have enough "timesinks" in place just to enter Everquest, implementing ways to give the customer default character/server options to bypass server/character screens and go directly into the game would be a good start.<P>Putting character password protection (from deletion) on each character, moving the delete button away from the others and making it smaller.<P>Put in more meaningful choices for the player to choose from in your polls and somehow add a small feedback area for the customer to add comments and read them when you can.  Run the polls more frequently.<P>&gt;&gt;"Allowing the player base a forum to vent and suggest changes has actually decreased customer satisfaction".  <P>I don't think this is accurate.  VI has already stated many times only a handful of players (200)actually read/post on these boards (compared to the entire user population).  This is worth pointing out if only that VI really does need a more accurate means of getting meaningful feedback from the vast majority of customers (if they really care).<P>If "reallocating" resources from this board will improve the game then so be it.  Put the people running this board in a "playtesting" department and have them test proposed changes to the game or whatever.<P>Why did Brad jump to respond to this post based on their own claims of the only 200 or so posters in here?  Ultimately, it's illogical for him to draw undue attention to this thread for this reason based on VI's own position on the importance of this board.<P>The only positive thing about Brad's response here that I can think of is that it's nice to see a blue name other than Abashi/Absor for once, and its nice to see he's watching.<P>This is not a flame.<P>*Shrugs*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Enough bad vibes already by the conspiracy theorists.<P>The problem is since they are not done through official channels, almost none of it can be taken seriously.  I am aware of office politics and how these things work.<P>Back to the subject at hand.  In my opinion, Auric is the best thing that could have happened to this board.  Sure, it may look like he is ruling with an 'iron hand'.  But he is simply doing the job he was instructed to do.<P>There were/are a few detractors from the usefullness of these boards.  And while it is not right to sho them away, it is within reason to ask for well thought out arguments.<P>Give it another week or two to reach an even keel.  I still think these boards are the best form of feeback Verant has.  It has done WONDERS for the game.  Removing or even reducing the amount of customer involvment would be -IMO- a bad thing.<P>I don't know how resource allocation happens within Verant.  I would think an additional person to glean information off these boards would be a good thing.  A simple standard response of 'We are aware of your concerns and are looking into the matter on our own timetable' would be good.  Yes, there would be moanings of "ITS NOT ENOUGH".  Running a business, I am sure all you guys have the fortitude to deal with shortsighted posts like that.<P>My 2cp.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Everyone has made excellent points here, and they are these points that are going to determine the course Verant plots for the Great Ship Everquest. This is a most enjoyable thread here, points and counter-points being debated in a civilized fashion. A most refreshing change. It is also excellent that this thread is being monitored. The more points and counter-points that are discussed, the better information Verant can glean to immprove CS and the EQ Experience for those still playing.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I say keep the boards but get rid of the blue name responses.  People will still come here with useless spam, rants, sillyness, and good ideas.<P>Verant will still be able to sift through and use whatever good suggestions come up, but by NOT responding officially you will not create that artificial sense obligation that some players believe exists.<P>Make the boards a one way form of communication, and of course - keep at least one moderator.<P>And use more log in polls.  This is where the real data comes from, people logging in, not the disgruntled players who wil obviously come to the boards.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>  This is something I have been thinking about for a long time.  And a long time ago I came up with my feelings on the matter.  Dump the boards.  I completely disagree that Verant NEEDS to keep these boards up.   People would not just wander away from EQ just because they couldnt ***** on the boards.  I actually think that the opposite would happen.  And the reason is this.  There would be no more mass negativity.  The only time I get really bummed about the game (besides when I die) is when I come to read these very boards. I dont really center on any one problem with the game until I see 100 rangers saying that their character is unbalanced.  That Paladins should have complete heal even more so than Clerics. That melee binding is unfair.  I could go on forever.  Some of these, and many other, points may be valid, but having it constantly thrown in your face day after day can really bring someone down.  And have them feel bad about the game they enjoy for the most part.<BR>   Give everyone a way to vent their anger or suggest a new approach to an old problem. Just dont let everyone see all the *****s in the armor.  In the end I think that everyone would have more fun playing the game rather than being on the boards.  Thanks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I can see how the mass negativity on the boards can be perceived as a problem that might be solved simply by getting rid of the boards.  For example,  I have never had a negative experience with a GM, but I get upset when I read about the arbitrary behavior of some gms.  If there were no boards, I wouldnt hear about any of this. <P>On the other hand, there would still be eq boards not sponsored by verant so I would still be reading about such things and, to the extent that complaints on the board cause problems to be fixed, my minor upsettedness is a small price to pay.<P>I do think some of the problems could be averted if Verant adopted less of a shoot first ask questions later attitude to complaints and suggestions.  I will give two examples.<P>The massive discussions of what changes each class needed were a good idea.  However, verant dropped the ball by implimenting the changes before the discussion was complete.  Instead of implimenting changes that way, they should have come back with a list of what changes they proposed to make to get a second round of feedback.  Sure some people would have provided non-helpful feedback here, but others would have pointed out problems which could then have been avoided.<P>A second example is the imbued jewelry.  This was poorly thought out and poorly executed.  If Verant was planning to put imbued jewelry into the game, why not ask for advice on it?  Again, lots of people would have complained about jewelry getting all the attention, but the ideas from other people could have been helpful.  Certainly, there is no way that the player community could have come up with ideas for imbued jewelry that were as useless as most of it turned out to be.  <P>In summary, Verant should continue the boards, but make the diologue more focussed on specific issues, respond to the players on those issues, and get the response before taking action rather than after.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I personally think the boards are a good idea, but they have gone extremely wrong. The majority of things I see on here are "give me this" and "fix it or I'm gone" posts. There are the occasional well-thought reasonable requests, but they get buried under all the garbage.<P>In an earlier post the idea of random polling was suggested, this sounds like a great idea. A GM signs on one night and asks certain number of every class to come and talk with him. Some wonderfully helpful changes might come from this.<P>I'll leave and head back to my utopian world now.<P>Lantih</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
