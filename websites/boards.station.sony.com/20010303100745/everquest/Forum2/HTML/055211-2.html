</FONT><HR>I, as all of my Ranger brethren here, have a few issues I'd like to discuss.<P>A ranger's symbol is a bow and arrow.  However, Verant has made it clear to us in the past that archery isn't a vaible form of ranged combat.  To that I say, then why even give it to us?  When I conjured up my Ranger, I really liked the idea of being an archer/woodsman.  However, my symbol is a moot point in this game, and our symbol should be a sponge for all that cleric mana.<P>A solution would be to rethink the stance that spells should be the only form of ranged combat.  I would propose a change so that Rangers only had the opportunity to use archery as a viable ranged combat system.  To counteract the possible exploitation of archery, why not make a bow that is Ranger only and only fletchable by a Grandmaster Fletcher (nodrop) that does enough dmg to be considered a viable alternative to straight out melee.<P>Another solution:  create a Ranger only Bow that does damage according to melee dmg modifiers, but have each "arrow" be a number of mana.  This removes the aspect of manaless effective ranged combat.  Also would be really cool to have effect be like a mini blue bolt spell flying from bow.<P>Which brings me to fletching.  The promised upgrade is nowhere to be seen and other tradeskills are already being upgraded AGAIN.  From a roleplaying aspect, I think Rangers should be synonomous with Fletchers almost.  However, due to the inability to make back the money you put into the skill and the ineffectiveness of archery as a whole, my 202 skill in Fletching goes to waste.<P>Now to Jolt.  I think Jolt should either be made unresistable or transformed into a skill rather than a spell.  This would cause it's effectiveness to go up as we increased in level, which is what I believe we're all asking for anyways.<P>Do not change Sow to 30.  Sow is a status symbol for us Rangers, and lessening the level by 9 only cheapens the fact that we have it.<P>Make Rangers be able to bind in outdoor zones ONLY.  I should feel uncomfortable in the confines of city walls, why should I be able to bind there?<P>Make Tracking work.  Higher skill caps = worse tracker in current system.  Create a scroll bar, filter, and a /trackplayers only command to aid us in finding ANYTHING in the outdoor zones, which is what we should be able to do anyways.  A filter would be most helpful, and it could be done by either level (ie /track 35 45) or by color (ie /filter green to remove greens from screen).<P>Please upgrade our defense.  We are far behind other melees, including bards now with test changes (/boggle).  Others have covered this extensively, so I won't dive farther in.<P>Call of Sky should, IMO, should be group friendly a la Call of Earth.  Groups would look for this spell especially pre-44 when Enchanters get boon of the garou (which doesn't currently stack with CoS).<P>Make our spells worth our time.  Unless kiting (which you guys don't like anyways), our spells are often a waste of damage in combat.  Until Call of Flame, any damage spell we cast will actually reduce our total damage output.  For example, if I cast careless lightning, I do a maximum of 99 damage.  In a normal melee round successfully duel weilding double attacking, I can do 100 damage easily.  With a FBSS and any haste buff, I can easily go through 2, sometimes 3 rounds of melee combat in the time required to cast CL.<P>Also, buffs are near useless because of non-stacking issues.  Give us some class only buffs (all hybrids) that would add a little spice to our lives (I know Call of Earth can be cast on others, but does not stack appropriately)<P>I'll leave it at this since this post is long enough and I know you have lots to read.<P>Jareck Thundershot<BR>46th Season Ranger<BR>Grandmaster Fletcher (202)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If you have a group with room for 1 tank, and the choice is ranger or warrior, there're only a few very contrived situations where you'd want a ranger over the warrior. In the outdoors, rangers would have a strong story, but OS, HS, Chardok are indoors, and Karnors is mostly green 56+.<P>There should be a compelling reason to want a ranger over a warrior and vice versa. Snare is one compelling reason, but it's not enough. Imo, rangers should do more damage than warriors, so when you have 1 primary tank (probably a warrior), you may prefer a ranger over a warrior as a secondary tank. If you prefer a backup primary, then you may choose a second warrior. <P>On paper, rangers claim an edge in damage output because of mana based damage spells. In reality, even if I could use my mana exclusively for damage (which I cannot because I need to jolt my entire mana bar), the regenration of mana for a standing hybrid is too small, and is further trivialized by the fact that the efficiencies of our spells are far behind our levels. Add to this the fact that spells interfere with melee, and if they are interrupted, you end up with less damage than if you hadn't tried to cast.<P>Rangers should get better ratio weapons than warriors. And rangers should get better damage tables than warriors. Warriors -&gt; Ranger -&gt; Monk -&gt; Rogue should be the progression of damage output.<P>One more comment - the damage output of warriors and rogues is excessive. It's easier to reduce their damage output, rather than increase the power of hybrids so they stay competitive, and then be forced to increase the power of all casters + pets to keep up with melee.<P>Ernham Forestwalker,<BR>59 ranger on Fenin Ro.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First thanks for the many upgrades since RoK came out.  They have already gone a long way towards balancing Rangers.<P>Here is something that I haddent seen yet. (although in truth I stopped reading on page 3)<P>Firestrike - lvl 52 spell - 155mana 302hp DD casting time 4.6 sec - recast time 2.5 sec<P>Calefaction - lvl 59 spell - 250mana 450hp DD Casting time 2sec - RECAST TIME 45sec<P>Firestrike is a more mana efficient spell than our lvl 59, but calefaction has the obivious advantage of casting time (in truth a huge advantage.)<P>However the recast time calefraction is so bad it make this very high lvl spell useless.  The recast needs to be lowed, or switch the spell out with a more useful one.<P>Ldare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Vanidar_Monnwhisper,<BR>While I agree with you Rangers need more HP (and arguably this is more important than AC at the level you are referring to), I think you are looking at one very specific example and focusing in to tightly on it.  Velious mobs and raid mobs is really an entirely different subject.  There is no question that HP is all that matters on these types of encounters (this is why low AC resist gear is so critical on Dragon Raids). However, day to day grouping tells us that 25-50 AC DOES make a significant difference in both taking less hits and getting hit less hard.  Right now Rangers are below the "break line" of Armor Class for their level.  Above the "break line" you take significantly fewer "max hits" than below that line (attack vs. AC).  It is excruciatingly difficult for Rangers to get above this "break line", having to get the top of the line equipment at every available slot.<P>Basically, HP is needed, however so is Defense (and dodge/parry/riposte as far as I'm concerned).  Not to be able to tank (we still wouldn't be able to do that), but rather to allow us to fill our role as a "damage dealer".  We can't deal damage if we're forced out of melee when agroed.  <P>Lowering jolt to a more reasonable level really doesn't solve the problem by itself either (yes it needs to be lowered), since one of a ranger's true value to a group is to be able to get a mob off a caster in short order (can really save a group).  If a ranger pulls off a caster and then immediately has to jolt to keep from getting killed himself, the mob is right back on the caster.  As it is now, if he continues to tank until the warrior/sk/paly can get it off, he's usually dead.<P>Only a combination of more Defense (AC), HP, AND lowering jolt will allow the ranger to fulfill his role as a true "damage dealer".  The only other option would be more effective archery, but frankly I think rangers melee skills mixed with a substantive increase in archery would be out of balance.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well these threads seem to point out that if rangers aren't one of the most eloquent classes we are certain one of the most Verbose.<P>Short List, as Verant have stated we are the damage dealers of the Hybrids.  I could post reasons but you must be skimming by now.  =)<P>1) Melee damage on par with warriors (like current skill caps on test)<BR>2) Melee plus Spell damage higher than warriors (kinda goes with item 1)<BR>3) Cold based DD spell(s)<BR>4) More HP (not alot but some)<BR>5) Effective hate list management before level 55.  Move jolt to 50/51, make Jolt II for level 55.<P>Utlity is nice and all, but should not have the same weighting as melee/damage dealing/defence skills.  Awesome utility will not get us groups.

</FONT><HR>... and to echo some other concerns...<P>Yes, our high-level DDs and DOTs must cast much faster.  Taking 4+ seconds out of melee is really hard to justify, especially when you might be massively hasted.  So what good are our damage spells if they don't get used?<P>Also, requests for the Defense boost we never got, and more hit points, must NOT come as yet another spell buff.  Spell buffs take up valuable buff slots, they wear off and need to be refreshed, they cost mana, they wear off at the worst time, and they can be dispelled.  We need real substantive adjustments, and not Yet Another Buff.<P>Thanks... :-)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Impressive thread.<P>I'd like to contribute a few random suggestions:<BR>A&gt; Self-only SoW-like spell at a lower level.  Make Rangers better pullers for groups.  Just a random idea.<P>B&gt; Archery.  Right now it is a manaless (or unmetered) form of ranged combat, hence it is kept relatively useless.  Now, many people would prefer if it was useful.<P>The only way BigV is gonna make it useful if it becomes metered somehow.<P>Suggestion:<BR>New Ranger spell line.  Very long casting time, and large mana cost.<P>Component: 20 arrows of some fixed quality produced by Fletching.  Perhaps a Quiver as well (higher levels require Tailored Quivers).<P>Result: LORE NO DROP 'Quiver' with N charges of summon 20 LORE NO DROP NO RENT arrows with _impressive_ damage and range.  If the Quiver is required as a component, have the 'Quiver' produce the appropriate base Quiver when it is depleted.<P>I believe EQ code should allow one to have a stack of LORE items recieved all at once.  If it doesn't allow it, it probably wouldn't be that hard to add in support (a bit annoying maybe, but not that hard).<P>You drop these arrows into your ammo slot.  When the stack runs out, you stop and summon another 20 arrows.<P>The Damage on the arrows, and the number of stacks summoned, can be tweeked to keep balance.<P>Voila.  A metered form of ranged combat that could be used by Rangers of all levels.<P>Faster bows would be more efficient at dealing damage, but would require crafting a new quiver sooner.  Slower bows would reduce the downtime require by maximizing the damage a set of arrows can do.<P>C&gt; Toss Rangers an Evak post-50.  Just one, to one location (Surefall?).  Pali's get Rez, SK get Summon Corpse, give Rangers a coveted spell from their caster-class.  And if it is unique (as TP to Surefall would be), all the better.<P>D&gt; If Rangers need a defencive boost, why not leave their defence where it is and give them Dodge/Parry/Riptose?<P>It would mean they would be hit hard when they where hit, but get hit less often.  And, get rid of the wierd situation where the plate-clad ogre dodges better than the lithe elven maiden-of-the-woods.<P>E&gt; There is no E.  The FDA doesn't allow it.<P>F&gt; If you are gonna fix Archery, fix the annoying 'you can't hit that from here' problem.  If casting spells isn't abusive in a situation, should shooting a bow be?  Maybe make Archery not work up as well, but make it shoot down just like a spell.<P>G&gt; Jolt good.  L 55 bad.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1) Lower Jolt to 50 - decrease resist rate<BR>2) PLEASE address Archery issues: minimum dmg calculation, chance to hit target, elevation problems, line of sight. Archery in it's current form is a low damage, extremely expensive pulling tool with limited utility. Fire based DD hits at ANY elevation and the mana recovers for free. Further, the spells ALWAYS hit for more damage than any arrow ever could (even crits).<BR>* These changes need to affect ALL classes that use a bow, not just Rangers, and this is a subject worthy of debating in a thread all it's own. Incidentally, when first introduced I was all for the elevation restrictions added to archery... it prevented combat exploitation. With the addition of a critters ability to ignore terrain/elevation in an effort to retaliate against it's aggressor however, the current elevation restrictions are EXTREMELY excessive. What matter whether I thump an arrow into the hide of a critter on a hill or cast a fire/lightning based DD spell on it? Same principle, different semantic. In any case, for the sake of ALL, please revisit this issue.<P>It's completely unfathomable that I can (with an Archery skill in excess of 200, and wielding a Raincaller) fire 10 arrows at a snared, fleeing, injured, DoT'd mob and miss 6 times, hit twice for 1 point of damage, and score 2 hits at 20 or less points of damage. <P>3) Raise Ranger Archery skill cap to exceed the Warrior (Masters of the Bow? The Bow is our class graphic/logo after all).<BR>4) Make Bow Crits province of the Ranger only.<BR>* Warriors/Paladins/Shadow Knights get melee crits. Restricting bow criticals to Ranger only adds the much sought after combat specialty without detracting from other classes significantly, and you avoid debates surrounding the dubious 'called shots' addition to the Ranger skill lineup.<BR>DO NOT give Rangers melee crits.<P>5) Implement promised Tracking changes<BR>6) Leave offense as it exists currently (ie NOT on test).<BR>* We deal enough damage, and our agro is often unmanageable already.<P>7) Raise Defensive abilities slightly<BR>8) Drop Sneak, Hide, and Disarm skills, replace with SafeFall (same skill cap of 75)<BR>9) SELF ONLY/OUTDOOR ONLY Bind <BR>* We are Rangers, and masters of the woodlands. We should be able to hang our hat in any forest glade and call it 'home' - I doubt that Verant's vision of the Ranger includes mastering the forests and woodlands, then trekking back to town for a good nights sleep. This is a parent class ability that fits the role of the Ranger, would gladly be accepted by the Ranger community, and is comparable to LoH/HT in hybrid specialty areas (without detracting from any other class). Further, outdoor self only keeps it properly limited in scope and utility.<P>10) DO NOT add gate/port/evac to the class<BR>* We are Rangers, and masters of the woodlands. We prefer to walk/hike/climb to our destinations.<P>11) DO NOT add pets/charm animal line.<BR>* We are Rangers, and masters of the woodlands. This does not mean that we wont kill and eat that bear should our bellies be empty - and it doesn't necessarily imply that the aforementioned bear wouldn't know this =) Respect (ie amiable to animals) is appropriate, but not actively employing them for our purposes... we are NOT Beastmasters.<P>12) Epic Quest is fine... thats why it's called an EPIC quest<P>13) Revisit Trueshot Disc - it NEEDS work<P>That's my 2 cents worth.... </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Greetings!<P>My fellow rangers are eloquent, and verbose.  I too, have some concerns, almost all of which have been brought up here.<P>My main concern, as a mid level ranger, is archery.  Right now, in its current form, it is mostly useless.  I myself shoot in real life, and I know I can hit my target with more than 30-50% accuracy, and I can hit pretty well near the center if not dead on most of the time, and I'm not nearly as skilled as my character is in archery, and he can't hit the broad side of a hill giant that's snared and held in place running away. All this with a dex and skill well over 100 now.  A profession bonus to hit and damage would be nice, like we get with our main hand weapon, and the buggy Line of Sight and elevation issues need to be fixed.  I have a feeling that if you fix the archery damage table for us, you won't have us complaining NEARLY as much about Trueshot, or aggro control, as we will still be able to output great damage (if costly; remember, magic arrows are definitely not cheap to make, and due to being so hideously gear dependant, I never have that much cash on me to begin with).  And with the damage and accuracy upped for archery, the damage and accuracy for the Trueshot discipline would be upped too, without need to re-work the discipline.<P>Disarm is a joke skill, and is already capped, and I'm only level 35.  I can't disarm a one armed blind orc centurion in crushbone with this skill as it stands now.  Please remove the 50 points we have in that, and put more in other places (I.E. 30 into defense, and then 10 into dodge and parry, or something like that). This skill currently will not see my hotboxes again, now that I maxxed it. <P>SoW for me is okay at 39.  Would've been nice to have it at 30, but it's not a class balance issue; more of a convenience thing than anything else.<P>It also would be nice to have See Invisible.  Not necessarily a class defining skill, but we are the only invis-capable class that does not have the See Invis spell.<P>I also concur with the idea that rangers should be outdoor bindable only; I shouldn't have to come back to the cities except to purchase supplies.  Take away our city binds, but give us outdoor bind points.  I'm definitely not looking for self bind, or anything like that, or even ports, as I believe that these are more convenience issues than real balance questions.  <P>I cannot personally speak to the 50+ problems that my class encounters, as I have no experience in that realm yet.  But, take a look at all the high level rangers who basically are saying the same thing, and you'll see that general consensus states that having caster defense as a melee damage dealer is really rather absurd, and an imbalance in and of itself. <P>With the removal of the experience penalty, and the promised changes to tracking and fletching that are coming sometime (I hope they still are, in any case), we have taken great strides in becoming a balanced class.  We're not there yet, but we're definitely getting there.  Just a bit more attention to detail, and we'll be truly a class to be proud to be a member of. <P>A well played ranger is a force to be reckoned with, because he or she has found how to work within the restrictive limitations that we have.  The difficulty of the class should've read at least hard when I signed on.... <P>Kenthil Windrazor<BR>Level 35 Ranger<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I could write you a well thought out novel on what needs to be done and why, but I won't. I do appreciate the way you have run these balance threads. Good to feel like we are being heard.<P>You wanted it simnple so here it is.<P>High level 'desired' group:<P>Tank: Warrior, hands down fits this mold COMPLETELY<BR>Cleric: Can anybody else cast CH?<BR>Evacer: not many other ways out of a Vellious Dungeon (im talkin about the ones you get exp from at 55+)<BR>Mana Pimp/Mezmerizer: Bard/Chanter<BR>Slower: Shaman.. PLUS he can buff for even MORE hp's to make the cleric CH even MORE usefull.<P>That leaves the sixth spot. I am trying to give you an idea of what I face every night. <P>Rogue: Can sense traps and open doors... also the MOST damageing class in the game after 55.<P>Monk: FD pulling and Tanking, VERY VERY handy.<P>Necro/Mage: Um pets... nice<P>Another Warrior.. heh you got yourself a druid as an evacer/Snarer you have 0 need for a Ranger, why not go with another of the PURE classes.<P>Ranger: hem damage wise he does more than Palis and Sk's but LESS than Warriors/Monks/Pets/Rogues.. defense is abismal and even if he is good will become a liability if he gets agroed. Has snare which can be purchased for cheap also can track.. of course so can a Bard and a Druid.<P>So I guess I have to 'settle' for getting a group ONLY if the above classes aren't available. I guess that's what I should expect being non-pure mellee.<P>Of course I HATE HATE HATE the term "pure mellee classes". I hints at the fact that I should be LESS of a class because I took the time to learn spells. I see it as I mastered my weapon skills to a point where even the GODS themselves have bestowed a measure of appreciation and have granted me some of thier divine abilities not that I am LESS of a class. You tell me ONE SPELL I use at the high end game that makes me = to a warrior/rogue/monk and I'll be happy. There is NO SUCH SPELL for hybrids. We do not equal PURE mellee in anything. Why do I not have = HP's to a pally/SK? Honestly does it make sense to give me LESS hp's than them AND less AC and LESS defense? ALL THAT for 12 more points of weapons skill and offense? BE REAL!<P><BR>One last note FIX TRUESHOT. Last night I activated trueshot and with 220 Archery Skill.. +3 summoned arrows, a bow of the underfoot (33/60) and 235 dex, I got the missed(you have missed your target blah blah) message 11 times out of 14 shots. The BEST I have done in 2 minutes of trueshot skill is  2345 damage in two minutes. That's less than HALF what I would do straight mellee againts the same mob in two minutes. Why even USE this discpline if it's HALF what I could do regular? Pfft, little hint on discplines... make it what it was or give it a static Damage for whatever level you are... like does around 4-5K at level 55 and 5500-6000K at 57 and at 60 does 6000k to 8000K in 2 minutes. Don;t use THOSE numbers I am just giving you a model to look at. My point is when I mash that discpline my bow should move at the same speed as my buddy next to me regardless of what UBER loot I have... or at least less dependant on. At this time NO BOW IN THE GAME does what trueshot used to do when it was broke...<P>If you DON't give us rangers any Defense or HP upgrades as the WORST defensive tank we should be the MOST offensive.... NOBODY should touch us in damage with blades if we are gonna lag 50+ points behind everyone else in defense and 1500K(yes I know Ogres my level that have 3K hps unbuffed) Hp's.<P>Sorry I know I said I wasn't gonna write a book but I guess once again I got carried away.<P>Talan Eaglestrike<BR>56th outrider the days of dour<BR>Rathe Server </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Thank you for this chance for airing out our concerns. Most of the rangers here have been discussing these issues on The Glade and believe you me, they were debated with as much enthusiasm there as if VI was actually monitoring the discussions there.<P>With the up comming changes on Test Server, our offense is nicely rounded up and this is a good thing as it helps define our niche in the game. However there are some serious issues that still stick out like a sore thumb. <BR>These being:<P>Spell Stacking.<BR>Call of Earth and Strength of Nature. Besides the afore mentioned Augment line / Shissar haste and pally Devine strength, other spells from the clerical line such as Shield of words do not stack well with these buffs. A possible review? <P>Archery.<BR>1) There are SEVERE and I do mean severe restrictions on archery that do not exist for any other form of more efficent/better methods of dealing damage. As it is, line of sight issues do not pan out. Shooting at the mob that is 100% visible but slightly raised in level in relation to you will have your arrow burry itself in the ground at the feet of the mob. Does not make sense does it? One would think that a grandmaster Archer would know how to aim and shoot at the mob (remember, the mob is 100% visible) in question and not just simply aim straight at the mound of dirt that the mob is standing on. <P>2) There is also an issue with accuracy. If needed, I can get logs to post here but that would make the postings excessive long with several hundred lines that you cannot verify if it has been doctored. However should you choose to test this, simply make two "test rangers" at lvl 60 with 100, and 200 archery skill respectively and have them shoot at stationary target 40 (could be 50 lvls down for all purposes) lvls down. <BR>You will see that accuracy is not that much improved even at 200+ skill. More so when shooting against higher level mobs with better defense. From my best estimation, (lvl 60 with 230 skill) I miss about 30%-40% of the time shooting at blue cons. <P>3) Trueshot. *sighs* The orininal "fixed" dicipline was really outstanding. Allowing me to do standoff damage that is equal or better then my melee. Even so, it required serveral limiting factors namely line of sight, visibility of the mob, elavation of the mob, mob in question needed to be "static non rooted" otherwise the added damage bonus will be lost AND the ranger in question needed to be satisfy both range constraints AND do all this in a swirling mass of players around the mob. NOT an easy task.<BR>Yet, the discipline was still seen as overpowering. In its current form, TS is being used by myself rarely is no longer seen as a benifit that it was. I logged my TS damage in a raid fight to be around 2000dmg over its course of time. Even with better, harder (and slower) bows, this damage over the course of 2 mins has seldom, almost never, exceed 3000dmg for me (this is in an IDEAL everything going my way situation which I must stress...almost never happen). Compare that to my Pure melee damge over 2 minutes and I have to say is about 30-45dmg per SECOND. Makes Trueshot more of a liabilty then a discipline. Namely becuase of accuracy that seems to be the SAME as when I am not using the dicispline (30%-40% misses) and a damage table that allows hits of 4dmg (double damage on a static mob) even when using a 33dmg bow with 3dmg summoned arrows.<BR>Perhaps this can be looked at.<P>Other concerns:<BR>As a Warder, the game has again changed for me. I am now spending about 90% of my time in the game on "raids". Here is where the end result of my past efforts and work (200+days playing my ranger) should justify my ranger in "groups". <P>The changes we see on Test server is good. This would mean we'd be doing damage and alot of it. Though the real concern now is to fix the above issues, spell stacking, archery and TS in particular. My other brethern have already voiced thier concerns which for the most part I do aggre on. Defensive issues well, if you do decide to give us some I'd be happy for everyone, if not, I'll be indifferent. At this stage, added AC to me isn't as much use to me as when I was pounding away at mobs on a day to day basis. <P>However, HP increase does beg some consideration. While 600hp at 60 isn't really that much (as some mobs take that away in just one singlular hit) it does and will make a difference when I hit the panic button (weaponshield) to allow my cleric time to heal me. <P>Good day to all of you, and my broters and sisters who have contributed to this discussion. <P>Shades and sweet water!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Again, I will reiterate that many of the things said before were put much more eloquently than I could ever say. First off, I am a 55th circle outrider of Tunare, with 110+ days of playing a ranger, not to mention more days playing other classes.<P>I would just like to re-emphasize 2 things, if I may.<P>1) Disarm skill -- a joke. If you are going to nerf us,please take this away.  Last week, I was foraging for the foraged item in Misty Thicket for the epic quest.  While there, I decided to work on 2 things --my halfling faction and my begging skill. (Would love to max out every skill I have)  I set up a taunt hotkey, that taunted, disarmed and begged each mob I fought--and then I proceded to run all around Misty killing orcs and gobbies, using the key as much as I could. I parsed my log the other day.  I attempted 1099 disarm attempts.  You know how many successes I had?  0. that is right, none. (Oh, btw, begging skill is now 100  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  )  Granted, not all of these mobs had weapons, but I would say roughly 20% have weapons (and this is conservative. I remember as a youngster being happy in MT for all the great loot the gobbies had). So, assuming my fights were all equal length, I had around 220 attempts at disarming VERY GREEN mobs, with no successes. This is why I call disarm a joke. I purely use it for its possible taunt value when I need to get a mob off a caster. So, please, Verant, nerf us by taking this skill away if you are going to nerf us.<P>Secondly, the part about VS. I am one who is ready to get my stone. Unfortunately, I will probably never get that stone. I am not in one of the uber-guilds of Inny, nor do I have a piece of another epic that those guilds might want to trade with me. My guild and its allies could probably defeat VS and his allies if we were given the opportunity, but unfortunately, that opportunity will never exist since the uber guilds now seem to be farming VS for their twinks leggings. Part of our quest involves triggered spawns (witness the EK DE corrupter)  why not do more of this? <P>Overall, thank you for listening to us, and for wanting our opinion. Would relish more comments from you all as you procede to making changes. We could function as a wonderful sounding board for any ideas/suggestions. Thankk you again.<P>Glakov Faythro<BR>55th Outrider of Tunare, Innoruuk Server<BR>Legends of the Realm </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I will avoid being long-winded here. I ask for three things for rangers to balance them:<P>1)Raise the offense and weapon caps to 252, as on Test;<P>2)Raise the defensive cap to 230, equal to a palidan's offensive cap; and<P>3)Make SOW available at level 30 in place of the  self-only infravision spell. (Very few rangers are human, and they generally have the night-vision problem solved long before 30.) If you want to keep the infra-vision spell, make it available at 15. On the other hand, rangers are primarily an outdoor class, and with the two expansions being predominantly expansive outdoor zones, they really need that SOW available throughout their the 30s. Very important.<P>Thanks for listening.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I only have a few points that I would like to have heard.  Thank you absor, for reading this, and I hope that you and those you work with take the posts from this ranger thread, and use them well.   <P>1.  I would like to see agility more affect ac and skills like dodge, parry, and riptose.  I never use disarm as the mobs do the same amount of damage with our without a weapons.  ITs only useful in PvP.  I think that something along the lines of  1ac pt for 3 pts of agility.  or 1 for 5 but make it a "hard" figure.  Also, say for every ten points of agility, give us a 1pt boost to Dodge, parry, and Riptose.  This could be applied to all Melee types or made ranger only but would help rangers the most either way, as we typically have the most agility of any class and would solve the defence/ac issue.  Also we as a class need more HP.  We didnt get an upgrade with Kunark, but at level 47 with no buffs, I have just over 1500hp.  Two friends of mine, one a cleric and the other a shaman, both have more base hp than me, and god forbid they engage in melee.  They are casters, and shamans have pets.  That is not balanced. WE fall somewhere between warriors/pally/sk, and Rogue/monk.  WE to more damage than Pally and sk, with less defense, but less damage than rogues and monks, but should have more AC.  We don't.  Our devensive capabilities, should be the same as a rogue/monk at the very least.  this would help us some.<P><BR>2.  Jolt.  Don't have it, won't for many levels, but could REALLY use it now.  Heck, I could have been using it for the past 8 levels.  Making jolt a level 39 spell would rock.  but, I'll let the higher ups talk about that.<P>3.  Archery.  Needs to be made better.  Why is it, that I find myself time and time again, in the Dreadlands shooting at Giants that I can see from the knees up, and not getting a message, which means it hit a hill, or the ground in some way.  I have a skill of 187, and that is unacceptable.  Then with my 5 damage arrows and my trueshot bow, I do 1pt of damage.  WHAT IS THAT&gt;?  I suggest these changes.  First, fix the Line of site and "target is too far above/below" There is no way I should not be able to hit a target on a hill above or below me.  Also, Bows should do a great deal of damage, at least more in one shot.  If I sit and take time to aim.  I suggest that if I am standing still, and ONLY if I am standing still, giving a bonus to damage and hit.  TO the tune of 1pt of "extra" damage per 10pts of skill in archery, that is added on after the final damage is calculated.  SO, say I shoot at a mob, AND I am standing still, and I hit for 1pt after the base calculations are added together, you then add 1pt for each 10pts I have in my skill.  This would add 18pts to my skill of 187.  And to go off the wall, make the base damage of the bow plus base damage of the arrow be the minumum damage of the shot.  And add this bonus to that, after all other calculations are made.  I'm not a math wiz so I couldn't tell you what that would be, but it would be signifigantly higher than the damage we do now.  I think this would benefit every ranger, because it could be ranger only, (since warriors have the same skill caps AND can crit, wich is total crap anyway).  This way, archery wouldn't be overpowering, and would give rangers another option of combat other than standing tall and getting shredded like a paper-mache doll.  Also, this would not take away the usefullness of magic since good damag arrows cost WAY to much to make.  Mana is free, arrows are not.  And it really couldnt' be used in dungeons.  It could, but at peril.  <P>4.  Spells.  Only complaint I have, is that most of our damage spells, by the time we get them, are near useless.  The nukes are ok, but underpowered, and the DoT's are meant for use against mobs sometimes 20 levels lower than what we are fighting when we get them.  We need an intermediate one, or change the spell, and say, instead of Stinging Swarm at 30, give us creeping Crud.  And then Drones at 49, instead of 54(?).  That would help immensly, and only if there is no druid in the group.  Also there has always been a stacking issure with out spells.  I have never understood why our buffs (skin like) series were always outdone by paladin buffs of equivilent levels. And from what  hear about our call spells not stacking with Chanter spells, that is crap. hehe.  Please take a look at this and fix it so they stack.  <P>I think I have covered all that I want to.  I love my ranger I have tried many other classes but non can compete to the enjoyment i get from this class.   I just wish I was as desirable as a rogue or a monk, or even a pally.  I am an extra, only taken when all other options are taxed out.  And when i have a cleric say he isn't gonna heal me if I get in trouble because it;s more mana efficient to res me, then I have problems.  Its that sort of thing that most rangers want to get over.  We play a tank because we like to fight face to face, yet like the versitility of the skills and spells. When I started this game, I was a tank, along with warriors, paladins, and shadowknights.  Now, I am told I am a damage dealer, yet to not do that as well as Rogues/monks.  Ok, so I want to tank, but i cannot do that as well as Pally's and Sk's my other Hybrid Brothers and sisters.  What do I do, where do I fit in.  I am a buffer, only if there isn't a druid in the group, so I snare, and root, again, only if there isn't a druid in the group.  what is my job, my niche.  If Archery was fixed, to be a viable form of combat, and my buff spells weren't overridden by just about every other line of spells, i might be able to find a nich.  Right now, I'm just the red shirt extra that dies whenever a new mob is encountered.  Very few people, unless they know you personally, will invite you into a group.  <P>I am a ranger.

</FONT><HR>I only have a few points that I would like to have heard.  Thank you absor, for reading this, and I hope that you and those you work with take the posts from this ranger thread, and use them well.   <P>1.  I would like to see agility more affect ac and skills like dodge, parry, and riptose.  I never use disarm as the mobs do the same amount of damage with our without a weapons.  ITs only useful in PvP.  I think that something along the lines of  1ac pt for 3 pts of agility.  or 1 for 5 but make it a "hard" figure.  Also, say for every ten points of agility, give us a 1pt boost to Dodge, parry, and Riptose.  This could be applied to all Melee types or made ranger only but would help rangers the most either way, as we typically have the most agility of any class and would solve the defence/ac issue.  Also we as a class need more HP.  We didnt get an upgrade with Kunark, but at level 47 with no buffs, I have just over 1500hp.  Two friends of mine, one a cleric and the other a shaman, both have more base hp than me, and god forbid they engage in melee.  They are casters, and shamans have pets.  That is not balanced. WE fall somewhere between warriors/pally/sk, and Rogue/monk.  WE to more damage than Pally and sk, with less defense, but less damage than rogues and monks, but should have more AC.  We don't.  Our devensive capabilities, should be the same as a rogue/monk at the very least.  this would help us some.<P><BR>2.  Jolt.  Don't have it, won't for many levels, but could REALLY use it now.  Heck, I could have been using it for the past 8 levels.  Making jolt a level 39 spell would rock.  but, I'll let the higher ups talk about that.<P>3.  Archery.  Needs to be made better.  Why is it, that I find myself time and time again, in the Dreadlands shooting at Giants that I can see from the knees up, and not getting a message, which means it hit a hill, or the ground in some way.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Hello Absor and thank you for holding these final class tuning talks. I will try and keep the post relatively brief.<P>With the test changes to our Offensive Melee Caps: Great work. As you've alluded to already in the other class discussions, Rangers in the eyes of Verant are the damage dealing group amongst hybrids. I expect as such that our melee damage output and offense oriented skill caps should be the same as warriors, a price we pay in less hps, lower AC on our armour and lower defensive caps.<P>Defense caps: With the above being said, however, I do feel that with regards to our defense it is much too low. Especially post 50 when you are dealing with mobs having hps in the thousands, and with our melee caps upped to equal that of a warrior we will be increasing our taunt significantly over the course of the fight. While in the interests of class balance (with regards to the overall picture) I do not believe we should get equivalent defensive caps to that of the warrior, it really is not much to ask for an increase in defense; perhaps to around 230 or 235 as has been suggested a number of times in these threads. Being a "light" tank, and a strong damage dealer, I don't expect to gain the AC of a warrior. The skill itself of Defense however helps to parry, riposte, dodge etc. though I realize there are a number of other factors that come into play (not the least of which are those skills themselves). We are not asking for warrior AC, that certainly would be completely contradictory to the subject of Class balancing (who would want to play a warrior at all if rangers did?). But the defensive cap being moved up will definitely help us to survive a bit of light tanking until the main tank in the group is healed up. Having defensive caps on a melee range type of class equivalent to that of casters is unreasonable.<P>Jolt: I am unfortunately only level 54, so I cannot speak to personal use of this spell. What I can speak to is the high degree to which I end up taunting as a result of my dmg output (melee and spells factored together). Any ranger post 50 can attest to that fact, plain and simple. I share my fellow rangers' strong opinion that 55 is too high. Rangers need the minimum level requirements lowered, as it will help tremendously to not only remove us from a post 50 mob's hate list and conserve the clerics' and healer classes' mana but will also help to remove the stigma that is attached to the ranger class as manasinks.<P>With regards to the taunt factor? I still personally feel that there are any number of warriors out there who still cannot taunt off us because of two main factors (again only my opinion based on what I have experienced from extensive grouping, certainly not a slight against any warriors in particular): a)warrior taunt is still not strong enough to reaggro mobs onto themselves and b) there are people who play warrior classes that do NOT actively taunt. It certainly will not help with rangers' melee caps upped to equal those of the warrior. Perhaps in the interest of warriors as well as all the other classes, it would be good to increase their taunt yet more to improve an average group's chances of survival? Something to look into in any case.<P>Archery: I think we all realize here that archery is not and will never be a replacement to melee. That has been stated a number of times by Abashi. But the way things stand now, it takes a complete backseat. Line of sight issues certainly hamper its use, and with the all or nothing discipline of Trueshot and no other(even minor)archery discipline it really is not a viable option at this point. Typically I use archery to pull or when I'm low on hps and the cleric tells me to back off I pull the bow out but beyond that I don't see it as particularly viable.  Rangers are masters of the bow...while I think we all understand that Warriors master most if not all weapons, I would like to see some intermediary disciplines implented for rangers alone whereby archery gets more use. And preferably a discipline that does not have a base resuse time of 72 minutes = ) Perhaps one where the discipline refreshes every 7 - 10 minutes? A suggestion in any case. <P>Also I think that with the marksmanship that rangers are alleged to have with their bows, would it be possible to have something akin to the rogue / monk ability to outright kill a mob with an attack using archery? Maybe I am reaching here... = )<P>Spells: The additions on test seem really nice! But, again I find myself a bit confused as to what it is we are as a class according to the Vision(tm). We are damage dealers, yet we get calefaction and firestrike which are NOT mana- efficient in combat? Our strongest DoT is drones of doom, which causes 340 dmg max in a minute yet in that amount of time we can do near equal or more of that in melee?? The casting times are quite an issue...while it is nice to have some DD spells to choose from, the 45 second recast time certainly reduces the appeal to use them at all. <P>I gather that plenty of rangers still use Call of flame at level 60, which against mobs of equivalent level is not particularly useful beyond some weak additional non melee dmg. As I said, the 45 second recast time makes it a virtual non factor against high level mobs. Without casting and minor buffs, rangers are then reduced to -- warriors without the ac, hps and defense, in major raids. And at 60, I am guessing that is pretty much the sum majority of consumed time for all my high level brethren...? I'll leave it to more experienced rangers to speak further on it.<P>Finally, HPs: All the other melee type classes were subject to hp bonuses post 50. Why is it that rangers cannot have that? Again, I will reiterate that no one is realistically expecting us to magically get warrior level hp's...but at the core of the entire defense issue with rangers, I think it's certainly something that bears a hard look at. This is especially significant when you factor in our tradeoffs as a class for having some great things i.e. dual wield, spellcasting ability, strong melee dmg in exchange for AC, hps, low defense, chain armour only. Well AC is out the window I feel...when it comes down to it, rangers are not meant to do more than some light tanking. That is NOT the core of our abilities, and I am sure to draw the wrath of many fellow rangers on this but no matter how much AC you stick onto yourself in terms of equipment, you will never tank as good as a warrior. We turn to AC to give us an edge in surviving the attacks of a mob, simply because that is the only thing we can control at this point. We can't up defense, nor HPs for the most part without outside help. AC, we can bump up. So I see all these rangers with great AC items, that still get owned and complain about our poor tanking ability when that IMHO only is not where our specialty or strengths lie. <P>You wish to balance things Absor, so we ask for some breaks on the defense caps and perhaps even hp bonuses. No one will ask for AC bumps on existing ranger only gear, at least I sure hope not. You've already moved forward tentatively on the test server by upping our offensive oriented skill caps to that of warriors. That was a great and positive step. But at the core you will need something to allow warriors to do what they do best i.e. tanking, and rangers to do what they do best which is to deal the damage via melee, range and spell casting without incurring the wrath of mobs. That is the entire essence of the final class balancing discussions, and in the end I do hope for the sake of all classes you find a way to let each one find its niche in the game. Certainly good luck with it all, and I look forward to seeing what Verant implements for our class.<P>Lonnlarcan Shadowblade<BR>Ranger of 54 seasons<BR>Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sorry if someone else has already brought this up, but 7 pages is a lot to read through. Anyways here's my suggestions.<P>1.) Make tracking made in different resolutions! I'm stuck in 480x640 because it's stupid clicking track and have the screen constantly ajusting the resolution.<P>2.) It would be a whole lot easier if we were about to /track soandso instead of putting PC's on the track list. I doubt this could work for NPC's but it would be cool.<P>3.) Give us regen like at 49. It's stupid have chloroplast and not regeneration.<P>4.) Make Tolan gaunts cast Ensnare instead of Snare. It's not worth having a double casting time on the gauntlets if it's not worth it.<P>5.) It would be nice if we either got gate or bind even if it was at high levels (maybe 49ish). We are after all, part casters. Even if it was something like Rings of Faydark where it only ports us to one spot and we can't change it.<P>6.) SoW at a lower level. You know how many times I got asked for a sow at level 20ish. Sheesh, I wish I coulda helped them out, but couldn't. =(<P>Thanks for caring guys!<P>Tnexus Fyrewolf<BR>44th Season Ranger<BR>Prexus Server<BR>~Azure Sky~</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hail,<P>Many great thoughts have been posted already and I'm very proud to be a part of the Ranger community.  Rather than re-hash what many of my brethren have said earlier and far more eloquently, I'd like to summarize my thoughts by stating that I am in the pro-offense camp.  I am *thrilled* by the changes on Test.  <P>Here are a few other things that I'd like considered:<P>* Tuning of the Ranger (and others') Epic Quests.  There seem to be two types of quests: ones that are bottle-necked by highly desired spawns (for other reasons) with long spawn intervals (Rangers, Druids, Wizards, etc.) and the others that are more based on triggered encounters (Clerics, Monks, Rogues, etc.).  <P>There are other issues about the inequality of the epic quests such as difficulty (Rogue on the easy side, Mage on the hard) and usefulness of "intermediate" items that result from doing the quest (Rogues get Ravenscale Mask, etc. Shamen get some nice items), but those are Ok and I am happy for those classes that benefit.<P>What is most irksome is that for several quests the necessary components drop from highly desired, perma-camped-as-soon-as-the-patch-is-over spawns with ridiculously long spawn intervals.  The two Ranger Epic gates are Venril Sathir and Innoruuk.  Mix in the fact that Druids (THE most populous class in the game, with Rangers coming in a respectable third or fourth) SHARE Venril Sathir and a change is needed.  Upping the drop of VS to two stones was a GREAT idea, but not enough.<P>Please consider replacing at least the VS, and possibly the Innoruuk, epic encounters with triggered encounters.  The triggered encounters could be VS or Innoruuk, but with them ONLY dropping the needed quest component (and in the case of VS, only ONE of the stones, so that you don't have two stones for every quest completed to that point).  That'd be great!<P>I envy my Monk, Rogue, and Cleric brothers and sisters, among others, who spend weeks planning a raid, gather up all their friends, show up at the ordained time, start the encounter, and have one HELLUVA fight!  No stress on beating other guilds to the punch.  Or taking off from work to be home when the servers come up.  Just worry about the opponent and how to get the resources to beat it.<P>That is what the Epic quests are about.  Not getting lucky and getting the resources and timing right to take down the opponent.  But about drawing upon fifty-plus seasons of sweating and bleeding with your friends to bring them all together for one final series of battles.  The struggle should not be about finding time off from work, or getting lucky on the patch, but on making friends, strengthening the community, and then being able to draw upon that to accomplish and epic task.<P>* Jolt lowered in terms of casting cost, resist rate, and level.  Forty-nine to fifty-one seems to be a more appropriate season to acquire it, that is when the troubles really begin.<P>* Ranger-only Tracking changes go in.  I hope they are still on the table!<P>* A watered down version of Charm Animal.  One that allows us to Charm an animal and have it follow us, etc. but does NOT attack on our behalf nor defend.  I know this will appear to some to be a "waste", but I ache for a Charm Animal that let's me befriend a bear or somesuch and have her as a companion while I am in the zone for roleplaying reasons.  A full Charm Animal would be more useful, obviously, but I have issues with having to kill the poor beast when it breaks and is mad at me.  Right now I burn through Mistletoe Pouches doing this roleplaying trick, but the RP illusion is ruined when the critter breaks the charm.<P>* A cold-based DD.  No more than a couple hundred points damage, like Call of Flame.<P>* Increased Thorny Vine drops.  I've seen dry spells of five raids in a row where not ONE piece dropped.  Also, as a side note that would please most classes I imagine, I'd like to see the Chests in Hate and the Jellos in Fear drop a random piece of a random class' armor.  I've only heard of Boots from Chests and Legs from Jellos for Rangers.  Maybe there are exceptions, but those are rare.<P>* The See Weather spell that was mentioned many pages ago (I'm sorry, but the author slips my mind) was neat.  It proposed allowing Rangers to cast a spell that would push out the clipping plane during rain/snow, hence reducing its effect on our visibility.  Nifty.<P>Following are some of the ideas that I don't support.  I respect my brethren's right to state them, but I honestly don't think it matches what I believe our role should be:<P>* Gate or self-ports.<BR>* Group ports or evacs.<BR>* Please don't remove Hide and/or Sneak from indoors use.  They have their uses.  You can have Disarm, though.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>Many thanks for the opportunity to air our issues, thoughts, and praise.<P>-Huntress<BR>Fier'Dal Pathfinder in her first season<BR>Rodcet Nife<P><BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wow..already on the second page of the second thread for Ranger talks.  After reading through all the posts..took me over 90 minutes, I really do feel for you Alan  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Just wanted to say that I am all for any of the proposed upgrades you've seen so far.  Any one of those will be an improvement to my class.  And any improvement in my class will make the game all that much more enjoyable for me.<P>I guess the problem with the hybrids in general started with the expansions.  Post 50 you made mobs a lot tougher with little increase to our skills.  We as players had to adapt and become a much more efficient cohesive group in order to rise to this challenge.  We had to form the most efficient group possible just to stay alive.  And in most situations we needed 3 or 4 such groups.  Now the 'most efficient group' is arguable and subject to some interpretation...but I'm fairly confident that if polled, very few people would include a hybrid as a member of such a group.  Hybrids are not efficient.  Thus began the hybrid group begging nitemare.  We fell to the bottom of the list..always added as a last recourse.<P>The removal of the exp penalty eliminated a reason to NOT include a hybrid in your party, but I think we're all looking for that big reason TO include a hybrid.  I think Archery could be IT for Rangers.  Can the bugs be fixed?  Yes, its logical that you should have to see the mob to hit it, but LoS is just a bit too restrictive as it stands currently.  <P>Can our hit ratios with bows be increased..how bout minimum damages on arrows...more crits..even crippling bow shots.  I liked some of the ideas about a line a spells that allows us to enchant our arrows..or add a proc..can this be done?  I would be much more desirable to a group if I could fire off arrows that had a root effect.  Right now my biggest problems with root parking a mob is pulling it far enough away and then getting my spell off before I'm beat to death.  I have yet to try that with a Velious mob...<P>I guess rather than raising some skill caps which would make us better warriors, couldn't we increase or improve some skills that would make us better Rangers?  IMO the former doesn't really improve our group desirability...at least not to the extent where a group wouldn't just grab another warrior.  <P>Could we try and come up with some skills that would make our class, and all hybrids, have more of an impact in the post 50 environement?<P>Again, I'm all for any of the proposed changes already mentioned..and even the changes currently on the test server.  In the end I dont think it's gonna help us get what we hybrids really need..a niche...some special 'wow' factor that is going to be desirable to the group and the raid.<P>And before you argue that by definition a hybrid doesn't have a niche...he's supposed to be part tank..part caster..but not as good as the parent class.  Sure..that was all well and good pre-kunark..but you changed the game after 50.  The hybrid is not a viable member of the 'efficent group'..especially not when there are better choices out there.<P>  The Foo<BR>52 Pathfinder<BR>  Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Nice posts all, just want to say what I think.<P>TRACKING Waiting patiently for the improvements.  The current one is nice, and the upcoming one will be great, but how about fixing it so that it won't lead me in the wrong direction when there are bug hills nearby.  This is a bug.  I hate telling someone I have something on tracking, tell them to follow me, and walk for 5 minutes, only to have tracking say it's now behind me, only to walk for a couple more minutes and have the cycle repeat itself.<P>DISARM  Flat out useless.  Earned at level 35 the skill cap is so low that it is useless by the time we earn it.  Give us a higher cap, or remove the skill all together for something a bit more usefull.<P>ARCHERY  First off, line of sight problems.  I can understand that an arrow can't hit a mob when something is in between me and a mob.  But when you're shooting at a huge mob, and someone is standing right in front of the center of it, does that mean I cannot adjust my shoot to another part of the body to hit it?  We are masters of archery, and have the aim and skill to boot. We should be able to shoot around things with ease.  The damage of archery is also in question.  At level 40, my 2HS is about 115 and using a 20 dmg sword, I can hit a mob for 57 (that's what I noticed while testing really quick, it may even be higher) so why is it, with a Trueshot longbow (20 dmg), a 2 dmg arrow for a total damage of 22, and a slightly higher skill in archery, that my arrow only does 28 or so?  Shouldn't dmg be equal if based on offensive skill, respective weapon skill, and damage total?<P>DEFENSE  We all know we get hit hard and fast.  Sure raising defense is something that we need a little bit of, and raising it to current Paladin/Shadow Knight offense numbers is indeed resonable.  I think it needs to go farther than that.  We are light and quick, therefore a high skill in dodge, parry, and riposite would seem appropriate.  I pride myself on having high AGI and DEX, I just wish it was worth more in helping me avoid all the hits.  I don't want to hit harder (well, it would be nice) I just want to avoid the hits.<P>BIND/GATE All casters get this ability.  I think that the whole bind system needs a rework.  I cannot understand the reasoning behind casters being able to bind themselves nearly anywhere, where everyone else is limited to cities.  Why can't everyone be bound where they want?  Why is it so hard to bind someone at the same place as any caster.  It is a low level ability for casters, why can't the hybrids do it.  To help aliviate this discrepancy this is what I propose.  Either 1) Allow everyone to be bound wherever a caster can be bound or 2)allow hybrids to cast at the least bind, I don't see hybrids casting gate.  Perhaps at level 30 or 39.<P>HARMONY Rangers are a great class for pulling.  We have many resources at our disposal to do so.  But why oh why, can Harmony only be cast outdoors?  Harmony is needed more indoors, I think, than outdoors.  I love to pull and show the ranger nay-sayers what a ranger can do well.  If you can't make Harmony indoor as well, how about a version of Harmony that works indoors at a higher level such as 30 or 39, even 49.<P>And last and probably least,<BR>SEE INVIS I like the fact that I can invis someone and lead them to safty, but it is annoying to no end that my ranger eyes are not able to see them.<P>I could say more about the offense/defense issue, but that's being pounded into the ground right now.  I think people are starting to get the point.  I must add that despite the negative image that rangers get, I love to play my ranger.  I tried to create other classes, but I have a hard time getting into it seeing the limited amount of skills that other classes get when compared to rangers.  The common perception of a ranger is a cross between a warrior and a druid.  I see the druid as a do-all for casters.  They have it all, ALMOST.  Therefore I see rangers as the do-all for melee with all the skills that we get.<BR>That's all.  Show everyone what a ranger can do.<P>Dumahim Ashenbane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Oh Yes, I forgot about VS and our epics.<BR>As it is, VS is farmed the moment he pops for one singular reason. Legs. This is unfortuante as not only do we need this mob to complete our epics, wizzards and druids too as well. (not sure if other classes need him)<P>The sad thing now is that all the excess stones are being traded off for plat (anywhere from 10kpps -30kpps depending on which server you are on)/ or items which the uber guilds want which in my opinion, cheapens the quest in itself.<P><BR>A suggesstion to make him a triggered mob would indeed make this task much much better. Triggering VS can be a VERY simple matter of just turning in the soft glowing stone into a container / mob to trigger VS' appearance. This version as opposed to the regular version however has a different loot table. Depending on whether a druid/ranger or wizzy trigger, he'll always have the epic piece for the triggering class. There will be NO ARMOR peice on this mob so that it will not be abused. In the case of the ranger / druid, this will be the completed "warm glowing stone" so it is an all or nothing fight. Again this is to prevent abuse as you need a warm glowing stone to trigger it (massive ammount of foraging time spent).<BR>I beleive the classes that requires VS now would aggree to this change.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My cp<P>  Axe the panic animal spell.  DUMB idea.  (this coming from lv 22 ranger, who would theoretically get the most use from it.)  All it is is a solo tool/powerlevel tool/dood tool.  It makes NO RP sense whatsoever.... Now then.<P>Fix archery:<BR>(in order of importance)<P>1.  Make arrows fly to top (or middle) of target, not It's feet.<P>2.  Remove all elevation restrictions.<P>3.  Give a message on what happens to arrow:<BR>I.e. hits ground, hits undamageable target, misses, WHATEVER.<P>4.  Arrows should NEVER hit the ground.  Arrows can be given arc.  For simple game mechanics, just simulate by allowing arrows to travel through ground. (course, still have to see target...)<P>5.  Double attack works same on archery as with any other weapon skill.  2 arrows used up when skill check successful, 2 arrows fly, 2 arrows hit or miss.  (Archer may have to be stationary for double fire check to even be made?)<P>6.  (Ranger only) have a good chance, based on archery skill, of successfully hitting target even with something in way, reaching 100% at the archery cap.  (firing through that gap in the crowd, nudging just around the tree far enough to get the shot off, whatever.)  NOTE:  would NOT allow shooting "through" walls, just through trees, NPC's, etc.  (maybe not trees...)<P>Oh.  and an idea I really like<P>dex buff at 22.<P>Also, of course, the wood elf and/or ranger fetching upgrades need to result in bows as good or better than "loot" bows.

</FONT><HR>Phew, damn missed the start of this discussion it seems.. 13 hour drive back from baltimore followed by 3 hours reading threads sheeeesh.<P>Anyhow my 2 cp<P>First off great start with the changes to the Ranger's repitore on Test. I agree with all of them whole heartedly. However the following things I see as a "Balancing" issue still, evenmoreso since our Offensive skills seem to be on the rise.<P>Like Monks and Rouges, rangers have drawn the lot of damage dealers. However Monks, and rouges always seemed to get pasted b/c of their high dmg output, thus they were given skills (FD,Evade) and higher defensive caps (Both in Defense, Dodge, parry, etc) in Kunark to keep them from dying as a result of the higher offense. B/c of their lower armorclass armor as well as lower HP's they never really did encroach on the Tank's teritory (SK,PALI,WAR).<P>However now the rangers are in the same boat. We need to be able to avoid/absorb at least enought dmg to keep us alive long enough for somthing to taunt off us.<P>1 - Raise Defensive cap : Since both Palidins and Shadowknights now defend significantly better at 60 (252 cap), and have moderate offensive skills (230 I think sorry its late). I beilive rangers whom are the other end of the spectrum should have offense at 252 (which is done now on test but is a much less significant change then the jump 22 point defense cap increase of Pali's and SK's), and Defense at either 230 (same as Pali/SK offense) OR Defense at 222 (+22 to defensive skills, same amount the Pali's/SK's got increased, thus scaling us to match EXACTLY what we were ratio wise before the changes<P>2 - Lower Resist rate on JOLT and/or lower casting level : Jolt should resist like a lure spell, currently it is resisted way to much and with our increase in offensive capabilities this spell is going to be much more needed in the future. Lowering of the Jolt lvl to 51 would also be a tremendous help since at this point rangers become much more offensive based and the other offensive Melee based chars (Monks,Rouges) get a skill to lower aggro much earlier on.<P>3 Stacking of Hybrid spells : I feel that all hybrid specific buffs should stack with every pure caster buff out there, and NOT stack with other hybrid buffs weither or not the buff is from a Pali, SK, or Ranger.<P>These are the three primary things I feel need to be done to balance rangers as a whole. Our Primiary problems are post 50 and involve not being able to survive our offensive capabilities long enough to make use of them. The rest is fluff.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am sorry.  I will try to be nice here.  For all you folks asking for self ports, binding, DE or other types of rangers please stop.  All these things have nothing to do with the balance of our class. <P>From my point of view the raise of offence skills was not needed.  I have never seen a ranger complain about the amount of damaged they did with two swords. If you truely want to know what to look at with the ranger class start with looking back.  Elderan love him or hate him was right.  Look at our defence, I am not going to post the numbers.  Its been done a million times.  Then look at the hate list.  There is something wrong there.  <P>Also, talk to Sunmoon.  If you want to get a list of things that NEED to be done talk to him.  E-mail him call him what ever.  <P><BR>One other thing I have seen posted about.  TV drops are pretty rare but I think that the loot tables in fear are what needs to be addressed.  Not TV its self.  Last month a full set dropped with just one ranger in the plane.  Yet not one wizard item drop.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>1) Archery Fixed: Line of Sight bugs and Elevation bugs coupled with pitiful dmg make this "Class Defining Ability" worthless. It isn't an upgrade, it has been broken since release.<P>2) Trueshot fixed: As is, this discipline is damn near worthless. When it first came out, it was pretty cool, because it allowed rangers to participate in a meaningful way at uber events. And since it is still using a broken skill to inflict dmg, it is therefore broken. Line of Sight and Elevation still effect it. What good is it if I use a discipline that does LESS dmg than I would do in melee? /disc trueshot with a windsaber should equal my dmg in melee with dual lamentations to justify the 70min reuse timer and the short duration of the disc. If it doesn't, *** would I use it for? I could just smack on a mob and pray that I don't proc with earthcaller(because then I get the uber beat down).<P>3) Swiftwind and Earthcaller should be equipable in either hand. Very often, I am not the person responsible for slowing a mob, 50% slow is a damn sight worse than a 60th shaman slowing a mob. Yet when I proc, even if the spell doesn't take hold due to a higher lvl slow debuff, I still taunt like mad. Taunting a lvl 56+ mob that hits for 1/6th my hp per hit is nothing but bad news for me. By allowing me to wield Earthcaller in my offhand I could reduce my proc rate voluntarily and thus lower my taunt.<P>4) Jolt: I rarely use this spell, the mana cost/casting time/resist rate makes it not worth the time or trouble. As a result, I end up pulsing attack and backing out of melee. While I am backing out of melee or pulsing attack, I am NOT helping the group in their objective to take mob X down.<P>5) Don't care about defense anymore. From 1100ac to 950ac I see very little improvement in the amount of dmg I take per hit or how often I get hit. So as far as I'm concerned, I don't want Defensive skill improves. I would however like to dodge/parry/riposte on order with the other chain limited class(rogues). This would actually make a difference, because a riposted/parried/dodged hit is zero dmg into my frail 2500hp frame. If none of this is done, then I'd have to ask for more hitpoints.<P>*note* Before RoK, Paladins, Shadowknights and Rangers had the same Hitpoint base. It was discovered that ranger AC was approximately the same as the plate wearing hybrids. This was largely due to the hybrids having identical Defense skill, Rangers inherently higher agility, Self only Stacking Buffs(Bramblecoat Line) and AC on quest armor was not balanced. So, Verant gave Paladins and Shadowknights a boost in Hitpoints to offset the AC. A quick fix at best. Post-RoK Plate Hybrids gained better AC gear AND gained skill points in Defense, while maintaining their hitpoint advantage.<BR>I'm not asking for my defense to be as good as Plate Hybrids, I'm not asking for my Armor to be the same AC as Plate Hybrids, I AM asking for more hitpoints now that the pre-RoK AC problem has been fixed.<P>Lvl 60 Paladin Self Buffed: 3500hp(NOT full hp/ac gear either).<P>Lvl 60 Ranger Self Buffed: 2526hp(my hp, with 142sta, a total of 650hp in gear).<P>So, Plate Hybrids can keep their defense skill, just relieve one of the THREE penalties against the ranger class.<P>6) Panic Animal should NOT be given to Rangers, Befriend Animal is more in lines with what the ranger class is about. Plus, I can see it now, Ranger with Fear/Snare/DoTs/Melee/Nukes becoming the new d00d class. No thanks. Resist Cold, I'll take it, it is a handy buff in certain situations. In line with our utility. Skin Like Nature, ok, little late(6ac 50hp 2hp regen) over what I have now. Spikecoat, won't use it, have upgraded version. It is good for lvl 49 rangers though. Firefist, won't stack with what I have now, but for lower lvl rangers, it is a gimme buff(should have gotten it anyways).<P>7) What is with all these fire based DDs? Why no upgrade to the lvl 15 AE? Or the lvl 39 Magic Based DD? Perhaps a quest for a lvl 49 or 55 Ice/Magic Based DD on the order of Call of Flames efficiency would work.<P>8) Lack of Wisdom on high end Ranger armors. By comparison a Paladin or SK will have 20 to 30 more wisdom than an equally well equipped ranger. Just like a Ranger will have 30 or much more Agility than an equally well equipped Paladin SK. My solution to this is to add stats to the Kunark Armor. The spells granted on Kunark armor are an absolute joke in comparison to what the spells meant to Pure melee classes. Paladin Deepwater and SK Blood Ember gain agility/dex/str on pieces other than BP and Legs, and Ranger's Tolan's gains wis/sta on pieces other than BP and Legs.<P>9) Finally, Tracking. We've been promised fixes to this "Broken Since Release, Class Defining Ability" but we have seen very few, and they weren't class specific(shared by druids and bards).<P>So no, I'm not, and most aren't, asking for Triple Attack, 4k hp, 252defense, 252offense AND Bind/Gate/Ports/Evacs. These are after all, VI sponsored Tuning Talks. I'm asking that they impliment these changes on Test, play test them extensively. If you find that the changes I, and others, have suggested are unbalancing after you thoroughly test them, so beit. That's what Test Server is for.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>more offense + higher weapon caps = good<P>No way to avoid aggro = bad<P>100%mr mobs all over Velious makes Jolt worse than useless, it's another taunt hotkey.<P>Ditch jolt, make it a skill (evade).<P>Some spells stacking issues that don't make sense (Okiell's Radiation overwrites Call of Earth? CoE is way better).<P>Both Rangers and Paladins get hosed in Fear. It took 10 raids before I got a single piece of TV. You design more areas for higher level characters because you know there are more of us than ever, should up the drop rate in the planes too, competition is fierce.<P>All of the archery suggestions I've read, while interesting, are fluff. Evade as a skill (that is on par with a rogue) fixes 90% of all Ranger woes, without making us unstoppable solo machines.<P>Fear animal spell is kinda goofy, ditch it. Way too good for a ranger who hits Ill Omen and then goes straight to Overthere, they will probably average 2 levels a day.<P>I think the vision of rangers needs to be made more clear, some people don't get it. Are we light tanks with defense skills that need raising so we can tank better, or a better method of avoiding damage than the current Jolt spell? It has to be one of the two, as you can see there are a lot of folks unhappy with the current situation. I'd vote for the latter, as a mid-fifties ranger I can still solo fairly well while most other melee classes are completely unable to solo blues at all. <P>Increasing defense and hp's are going to make me even better at soloing. I prefer to group, and be desired in a group. As it is right now, only my charming personality and sparkling smile get me into guild groups, trying to get a group outside of my guild is a total waste of time. I'd rather be more desirable as a highly damaging, quick and nimble dodging damage fiend than someone who can tank as well as a rogue and deal less damage (which would be what increasing def and not increasing offense would do... dunno what some people are thinking). <P>So I say... ditch Jolt spell (or I'll never go to Velious, no matter what kind of phat lewt is there until I'm maxxed at 60 and don't care if I die), give us an evade skill and the offense/weapon caps on test, the spell changes are nice, but basically fluff. If you want to make any kind of post-50 spell changes, give us a post-50 DD that isn't fire based.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The changes making rangers offense as good as warriors is good.  <P>Please also adjust so that our defense is a bit better too.  Because a defensive hybrid (SK/pally) is much closer to us in offense than we are to them in defense.  Rangers need to have skill in defense, parry, dodge etc that are closer to the offensive skills for SK/Pallys.  Now the numbers are significantly lower.<P>Archery need to be better.  Double the damage from archery (right now as lev 49 ranger shooting ona blue mob I average 7 to 9 damage per arrow with a damage 1 arrow which is way to low) and make the arrow material for higher damage arrows lower or increase the damage done by them.<BR>Raise archery skill cap to higher than warriors (255).<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sorry guys but since you are bringing up Paladins and Shadow Knights into this i must make a statement.<P>Harm Touch does less dmg than your BOW Discipline<P>Rangers have better Offense, Dodge, Parry, Weapon Skills, Duel Wield (bigtime difference in dmg) and many offensive spells to add to your class.<P>Rangers are not and should not be Dungeon Tanks... After reading some of these replies it seems thats what many are asking for.  Rangers have no equal in open areas above ground where all their spells work and their true power shines.  No melee class or hybrid can match the skills of a Ranger in above ground zones.  <P>In dungeons that is where the Melee classes and Hybrid Tanks shine.  This is where the rangers have most problems due to spell limitations and they are not as effective as other classes.  This is as it should be in my opinion.  <P>Lets agree to one thing each class has built in strengths and weaknesses.  If one class had no weaknesses why play this game it would have no challenge or flavor.  Obviously Rangers are not broken... there are admittedly weaknesses and if changes on test Offense and Weapon Skills = to Warriors plus those dodge and parry upgrades Rangers got id say the only area where they are not equals of Warriors are in HP/AC (Defense) ohhh and Triple Attack. Other than that they are Warriors with Spells in almost every other way (Minus Disciplines of course).<P>Now lets ask this question IF Rangers were given HP/Defense upgrades what weakness would they have compared to Warriors... Answer is they wouldnt have a significant weakness.  In fact given the addition of their offensive spells some might say that Rangers were superior to Warriors in almost every way.<P>There is no doubt that Rangers are one of the powerful classes level 1 to 60 and that they do have weaknesses in Dungeon fighting.  However compare this to weaknesses for Shadow Knights and Paladins make a list comparing the weaknesses of Rangers to weaknesses of Shadow Knights/Paladins after including the TEST server upgrades and you will see that the Knight classes have far more weaknesses than Rangers.<P>I submit that Verant will not upgrade Defense/HP however they did upgrade everything else.  I suggest focusing on spells because I am here to tell you if Rangers get a Defense and HP upgrade it will really piss off Warriors/Shadow Knights/Paladins.  In my opinion would be completely unjustified considering cleric buffs of both AC/HP minimize most of the defensive weaknesses of Rangers (Hint: Carry a lot of periodots like I do to get the good HP buff)<P>This is not an attempt to flame and I wish you well with your Spell upgrades.  Congrats on the Melee Skill upgrades I still wish Shadow Knights and Paladins had more in that area but oh well were not meant to be offensively oriented I guess *sigh*<P>Kaitan (Nightmare Clan)<BR>55 Shadow Knight<BR>Ayonae Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>'Most powerful class from 1 to 60' whether you meant to or not, you're trolling, and I don't mind stepping up to the plate.<P>Who dies more often, rangers, pallies, or SK's?<P>I've been left in slack-jawed amazement at some well-played SK's, and think that they are at least the equal of rangers when it comes to outdoors. With Fear-kiting, better ac and hp's, better dots, and a better class-ability, sk's shouldn't begrudge rangers whatever happens.<P>If all of your Kunark class armor was in dungeons (where you say we are weakest, and I totally agree), you might want to be able to go there and survive the trip. You might also want to get some xp in dungeons, where you get more xp per kill.<P>Look, I want SK's to be better than they are now, think they have a hard road (except for equipment, very little competition for their stuff, and planes armor is ridiculously easy to get), I want Paladins to be better than they are too, because they need some help. You should also recognize that as things stand right now in the game, rangers are considered the most worthless to groups (by non-rangers), and want us to get improvements we need/deserve after going so long the way things are.<P>Inevitably on these threads warriors are going to step in, and try to keep hybrids down, the last thing we need is infighting among the hybrids.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055211-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055211.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055211-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055211-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055211-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055211-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055211&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055211&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
