</FONT><HR>Algara:<P>Thanks for the correction.  I should have stated that the average level 30 is using this weapon - as well as a whole TON of level 40's, and even several 50's that I've grouped with recently.<P>Lady Morgaine:<P>It's probably still 5 or 6k cause of economic inertia.  No one wants to sell theirs for significantly less than it sold for yesterday, so the price can only plummet so fast.  Two weekends ago it was selling for 9k.  Not long before that it was 15k.  Things just don't drop -that- fast unless there's something seriously wrong.  I think when people say 1k or 2k, I think they are estimating what the price will plateau at, and I would say that's a pretty good prediction.  And, since most people familiar with the weapon and the quest agree that that's what it will be worth in, say, 3 weeks or so, they wouldn't buy it for any more, and so to them, 1k to 2k -is- the current price.  I would be very surprised if they were still over 2k by Halloween.  Just be patient a bit.<P>For me, it's not about the market.  If it were, I'd be rushing to sell mine while the inertia's still going, and then go quest mine again later.  <P>What it's about is that I'm seeing wurmslayers on auction in every zone I'm in (even in Mistmoore last night!).  At least one out of 3 tanks I see level 30-52 or so is carrying one.  What it's a matter of is diversity, which EQ has always had and which I've always thought is a great thing.  We're losing that -fast-.<P>You'll get yours soon enough, don't worry.  Honestly, I would've thought that the people who didn't have one yet would have rather had the spawn rate nerfed than the stats nerfed, and that's why I supported that, but if you -insist-, fine, nerf the stats, won't bother -me- any.  I'll soon be at the point that I -can- get one of the few better weapons in game.  But I think those preferring a stat nerf to a spawn nerf are cutting off their nose to spite their face tho.<P>Remember, you could cut the spawn rate down by a factor of 10 times, and still be getting 3 or 4 into the game a day.  I didn't say make it UBER UBER RARE, I just said don't make one every 10 freaking minutes.<P>Qwinn Windfletcher<BR>49th Ranger<BR>Tunare Server<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I'm guessing at least 30 or 40 or so.  Someone posted a great list above.  This thing has better stats than most 2hs, for god's sake, who would ever use 2hs again?

</FONT><HR><BR>Its original value was based upon it being range slot equippable which they said was a mistake. Frankly on an established server it is not very good being non range slot equippable.<P>It is still one of the best quest rewards in game pre the class particle weapon quests. It is just not as good as many drops that people get or sell in game. That doesn't mean it has to be changed, everything doesn't have to be fantastic.<P>I think its great you saw it at 1 k. I'd say now it might go for 4 or 5 k, its just not worth anymore.<P>Suggesting that it be made no drop, as someone else did, is silly also.

</FONT><HR>You cant compare pre-RoK weapons to RoK weapons, it doesnt work.  My Blood Fire was made MUCH less desirable with RoK.  All the Spined Dragon Claws, Ashenbone Axes, Razing Swords of Skarlon, Vexthornes, Briarzephyrs, Bone Razors, etc could be outclassed by fighting AT THE ZONE LINE OF KARNOR.  Jarsath trident, Locustlure, Poly Axe, Fist of Zek, Oggok Cleaver, etc to name a few from that dungeon which is the "lowest high level dungeon" (if that makes sense).<P>The Wurmslayer is SLOW.  I've always been a 1hand guy (using 2 bloodpoints at the moment) but I tell ya, before I was using a cloak of flames and tried out a Wurmslayer.. I about cried IT'S SO SLOW.  Which would you rather do, hit for 63 once and miss, then wait 4 seconds to swing again only to miss twice.. or to hit for a consistent string of up to 52?  Fast weapons will *always* outclass slow weapons if they are 1-handed (unless they decide to scale damage and totally destroy any semblance of player versus mob "balance").  Obviously at lower levels the Wurmslayer is better due to a lack of damage bonus, but trust me.. by the time you hit level 50, if you're still using a WS, then I pity you.<P>Oh and how many times do you see a level 30-something using a Sword of Skyfire?  I had I think the third on my server.. and now I see TONS of twinks with them.  The weapon is wonderful.. until it procs.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>"by the time you hit level 50, if you're still using a WS, then I pity you."<P>*sigh*  <P>From direct personal observation and use:<P>1)  Wurmslayer generally outdamages Dragon Horn Ykesha, an 8/23 Yak Proccing Ranger-Only weapon.  Considered a good 50ish weapon.  Only way DH wins is if I get a good 2 or 3 procs at least in one fight.<P>2)  Wurmslayer outdamages an EBW -consistently-.  EBW is 7/21.<P>3)  Wurmslayer occasionally outdamages Revultant Whip, which is a ranger only planar weapon from Hate and you people's bloody dream, damage 5 delay 14.  Basically it seems to be kinda luck of the draw which one does better.<P>YES, for God's sake, we all know about the damage bonus, but you make it out to be EVERYTHING.  It's -not-.  You're immediately dismissing a ratio of 5/8 for weapons with a ratio of 3/8 or even 1/3.  That's a MASSIVE ratio difference.  You people are as bad as those that think ratio is everything, except that you guys are far more elitist about your own awesome "knowledge of the game".<P>And by the way, I loved how the one example weighed a Wurmslayer attack hit of 64 with no double attack (my better attack with wurmslayer is a double attack of 90 or 95 each) against a constant stream of max damage hits from the faster weapon.  <P>Oh, and for those who think that higher damage and delay just SUCKS, which would -you- rather riposte with?<P>Qwinn Windfletcher<BR>49th Ranger<BR>Tunare Server<P>Qwinn Windfletcher<BR>49th Ranger<BR>Tunare Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I hate to say it, but the EQ economy IS out of whack... and is getting worse.  Has been for some time now.<P>The basic problem is simply that the "elite" gear is becoming more and more valuable... while the "junk" is becoming less and less valuable.  Prior to Kunark, Yaks were 5k weapons and Mithril 2H were 8-10k.  Now, you're damn lucky if you can get 2k for either.  Prior to Kunark, BIBS (Blackened Iron Bastard Swords) were 3-400 plat weapons for lower level folk... now, you're lucky if you can GIVE it away (thanks to the Axe of the Iron Back in specific).<P>Now, without getting too far off topic, the Wurmslayer flat out IS broken.  However, I'm not going to state statistics to you... not going to prove my point with math (really no need to... I suspect some folks would look at the hard facts and still refuse to believe them).  I'll simply ask one question...<P>How many people have Wurmslayers now?  What percentage of 50th Rangers and Warriors wield Wurmslayers now?  Hell, on Cazic Thule (my primary server), I can't REMEMBER the last time I saw a 50+ ranger NOT wielding a Wurmslayer.  Yes, at one point Ykeshas were in the same boat... but after they fixed the 2handed weapons, that quickly changed.  However, with Wurmslayer as good as a 2h weapon, but without the disadvantages... why would anyone NOT wield it?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Geez... its amazing to read a thread like this, and then read a thread complaining about xyz weapon not being powerful enough. I really dont see it as THAT easy to get. For starters you have to kill 2 named wurms, one of which only spawns after gullerback has been killed, and they uber-buffed gullerback a while back so hes almost 100% magic resistant these days... <P>Even if some people think its too easy to get, why not leave well enough alone? Uber-rare items only serve people who play the game constantly. Why not let everyone else have something halfway decent? If the price has dropped, well good! I say the more people that have access to decent gear the better. If every single person on every server wants to take the time to do the quest or buy the weapon, I say more power to them. <P>Its absolutlely sickening to see people whining that too many people have a good item, what is wrong with you people? Why does it matter to a_powergamer00 if a_casualgamer00 can actually get a decent item? Theres enough incredibly rare items out there for those with the time and energy to invest in finding them. <P>As for a full group of 6 being able to do the quest start to finish in 8-9 hours... believe it or not a lot of people dont have the time to play EQ 8-9 hours straight. I'm lucky to get in one session that long every two weeks. <P>Asking for stuff to be nerfed helps NO ONE. <P>To the people asking that this be made uber-rare or nerfed... I hope that you remember that next time something that you want is nerfed or made rare... <P>SeaOtter<BR>Wizard 52 of Bristlebain</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Whereas the Silvery 2h comes from the same level range Mob who used to spawn fairly frequently when people camped the throne room.  Only difference now is that people are killing Kunark giants left and right with relative ease, causing the spawn of a giant with an axe of the iron back to show up more. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Like I said, if you're 50 or higher using a WS, then youre doing something wrong.  Go to hate, spend a week, get a whip -- that easy, have 1 in my bank just in case people figure out how to transfer again  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"> (and a eyerazzia and darkmetal sprinkler, hehe)  Right away you have a weapon that is far superior in your main hand, which coincidentally is the only place a WS goes.  And yes, I guess my example was a bit skewed but it is more of an in-game experience.  Slow weapons = more painful misses, and considering you only hit mobs about 60% of the time, with a WS that's a lot of painful misses!<P>Go to Karnor, get a Lupine Dagger.  I'd say 95% of the rangers above level 50 on my server have them.  Go to Sebilis, get a crystalline short sword or a lamentation.  A sarnak warhammer.  TONS of things totally outclass this weapon at 50 and above.  If you still use it by then, then yes you are poorly equipped in the weapons department.  It's a nice low to mid level weapon, why ruin those people's opportunity to use it?  Nerfs are never good.

</FONT><HR>After reading all this thread I have to say that the bulk of whining appears, to me, to be people po'd that it has made other weapons worhtless - not worthless as weapons just worthless as items in the economy.<P>Well to that I say "Phooey to you!!!!"<P>The Wurmslayer is a good highend mid level weapon that doesn't require days on end of boring camping or moutnains of platinum to acquire.  In other words the game finally has a weapon of good quality that the casual gamer can get with reasonable effort.<P>It is not the best weapon for a warrior or a ranger or a rogue or a paladin or bard or an SK, but it is a good one.  This leads me to conclude that one of the chief reasons people are raising such a stink is that they are too lazy to go get the better weapons.  But for that I blame you not in the least becuase to do that we are talking camping days on end or mountains of platinum...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Since I haven't used a Wurmslayer, I can't comment on how unbalancing such a weapon is.

</FONT><HR>The wurmslayer is very easy to get.  On my server, I have 3 of them.  I didn't dupe.  I also have the scales for a 4th one.<P>I haven't done the quest for the 4th because the item won't fit into a slot.<P>Yes, I went to PoF the other day and every ranger there had one.  It is a good weapon.  It does one thing for rangers.  First, it has very good damage for their str and ATK.  The second thing it does is, that because it is so slow it rarely taunts mobs on to the ranger.  Finally, it is relatively easy to get.<P>The relative ease has nothing to do with Rangers though.  It has to do with the ease of which a druid can solo the mobs.  First, the named mobs, Azdalin and Glyton are lower level the regular wurms.  They have fewer HP and they don't hit as hard.<P>Once you get the glyton and azdalin scales it is easy to get the 3rd scale.  Then you just have to spend the time hunting down Fuzzmin in FV.<P>The availabiity is, in my opinion, based solely on the fact that the two named wurms are so easily solo'd by the Druids.  I do see Necros there soloing it as well, but really, they are after bigger fish anyway.<P>The value of the weapon seriously dropped in value and I knew this would happen as soon as the mini-quest for the XyFyl scale became known.<P>Verant can take it out of the game or lessen its capabilities.  That's probably what will happen.  I see many SKs and Paladins using it.  A good buffed warrior can do incredible damage with one of them.<P>The main drawback of the weapon is that it is primary hand only.  It isn't the stamina that's the major issue, because you can ignore that most of the time, or have someone cast invigor on you.<P>It would be a better weapon if it was primary or off hand, but then again, the damage that could be done with two would be far too much.<P>In a recent patch Verant stated that they'd made the 5/10, 10/20, 20/40 etc, weapons basically do the same damage over time.<P>The real question is why are so many RANGERS after this weapon.  The answer is because of the lowered taunt factor due to the bugs in the hate list.  This lower taunt with the higher damage keeps the ranger from getting smacked down and they still can wield a 2nd weapon.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well, to all those that are making some bad assumptions, let me clear something up... I do not currently own a Wurmslayer, but I am getting one this weekend for my warrior.  This really, however, has NOTHING to do with why I support a "nerf" in this case.<P>Essentially, the fact that it is flooding into the game at a rate of 30+/day is proof that there is a problem.  The fact that they are being SOUGHT at that rate is further proof.  Given this rate, it will be very little time before they are pretty much "standard" equipment... if they aren't already.<P>My assertion is that in any case where you have a weapon that is clearly "essential", so much so that literally everyone has one or seeks to get one, this should point to a problem.  As you will recall, they removed Manastones and then further nerfed them BECAUSE they were becoming "essential" equipment.  If you didn't have a manastone, you were insufficiently equipped, and were sometimes refused groups because of this.  Frankly, I have already seen this with Wurmslayer.  I have already seen Rangers refused from groups because they were wielding Yaks and not a Wurmslayer and another weapon.  Tell me, do you really prefer that?  Do you really prefer that a Wurmslayer become "necessary"?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>"Any and all who say this is to easy is a FARMER who is SO SO afraid that HEY HE HAS ONE TOO MOMMY IT ISN'T FAIR."<P>Calebe, I truly want to flame you huge, but I'll withhold.<P>Have you read nothing about what we've said?  The impression I get is you haven't even done the quest and have no idea how easy it is, or how good a weapon it is.<P>I calculate that there will be within 2000 to 3000 of these on Tunare by Christmas.<P>This isn't a matter of it being "unique".  "Unique" went out the door weeks ago, these things are already EVERYWHERE.  And if you took this thing away from me and then made it never drop again right now, it wouldn't bother me at all on Tunare, cause there are already sooooo many of them around and being used that I pretty much feel the market is -already- permanently flooded, this thing will never be worth real money again once those trying to sell it now realize how many there are out there. <P>So, if you are fine with the concept that every level 6 character on a server will have a wurmslayer, when you simply don't -see- any other weapon (ever), when a 1hs 25/40 weapon becomes the lowest common denominator and NO ONE IN THE GAME can actually EARN A COMPARABLE weapon until they are level 45...<P>Think about that.  Think about the fact that there is no longer a weapon that a tank can camp for for 45 levels that begins to compare to what every single tank on the server already has.<P>Unless this is fixed in -some- way, that is what's going to happen.  Yes, the ease and frequency of getting this compared to any other weapon in the game IS that extreme.<P>Qwinn Windfletcher<P>P.S.  I shouldn't even say this - but, as a level 49 ranger, I believe that I... yes, a RANGER... can successfully solo Azdalin and Glyton.  Throw me a cleric and it'd be a cakewalk.  But there's a trick (not an exploit, it is -hardly- risk free) I know that would give me a good chance of soloing them.  In -theory-, if I was very very good, with zero lag and great timing, I could end the fight at full health -and- mana.  I don't know that anyone could be -that- good, but let me just say, they're definetly soloable to a 40's -tank-.  If that doesn't make you stop and think, I don't know what will.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

It does not need to be nerfed. I'm a Bard, don't have one, couldn't use one if I did. But I don't want to see anything nerfed. Ever. <P>Honestly, who thinks 'good and cheap' is bad? Sellers, mostly. Or buyers who already bought theirs and want the value of their investment artificially propped up. Or folks who want their item to remain rare so they can feel 'elite'.<P>Yeesh, what I hate *most* about multiplayer games are the busybodies that are scurrying around worrying about what everyone *else* has.<P>Play the game.

</FONT><HR>(First off let me say that this is my first char to reach 40, so im kinda a n00b.)<P>So its easy to get, wahhhhh. Maybe its because this game is 2 years old and the % of actuall newbies is about 10-15%. Of course your going to see them everywhere just like i see warrior is full crafted at lvl 6, and SK's and pally's in full DF/Ro. Cmon, the look at the ghoul lord for example.We were camping him last night and the only reason all 6 of us were there is that we all already had yaks/plane gear. So we were there for our alts. BIG Whoop.<P>I think its going to be just as easy if it was a drop as it is a quest for people to twink with. Because those high 40's and such are still going to be able to get it to twink with. Making it no-drop is just going to piss everyone off. So stop your whining.<P>*continues prodding the Magi for his SMR*<P>Morgar Souldrinker<BR>40th Ring of the Dead<BR>Solusek Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I find it hard to believe that 30 or more wurmslayers are being obtained daily. I've gotten the Glyton scale before, but I hunt in BW regularly, and Azlain is a pretty rare sighting. More often than not Azlain isnt triggered because Gullerback is a huge pain in the butt. It takes at least a full group of 50+ characters to take down gullerback. Since gullerback must be killed to spawn Azlain then the only way that "every level 6 will have a wurmslayer" is if those high level characters spend time farming the item and selling it rather than getting one and moving on. <P>Seems like every low level caster has oracle robe or GSD, you dont see high level casters here complaining that those robes are too common do you? How absurd... I wonder what absurd request to weaken the player base will be made tomorrow? Because I'm sure it wouldnt be enough to nerf a decent weapon, they'd find some piece of armor next, then maybe a spell, who knows what after that. Following this philosophy no items should exist anywhere other than Veeshans Peak, and then only rusty weapons that drop once a year. Imagine the farm price then... I can picture it now... "a_pOw3rgAm3r00 auctions rusty longsword 100K pp or trade for rusty scimitar" .... </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Great...gotta drop gullerback.  This scares me kind of because of what people have said about him.

</FONT><HR>Guys, your all saying goto Seb, goto plains... <P>Got news for you, alot of people simply DON'T HAVE THAT OPTION!<P>i've a level 50 mage thats never set foot in either place, and probably will never. Why? Two reasons. I refuse to join one of the uber guilds on Xegony, and these places are tuned to guilds than can put 4 groups of 50's together. <P>For some of us, this is a great weapon! My first char was a Troll Warrior. He is now level 40 (I stopped playin him in favor of my mage, who was, at the time, more useful to my guild. Now most of the warriors have quit, in fact, at 40 i am the second highest level, and the only other war) and Duel wielding a WS/SSOY. I gotta say, he does some nice damage. I can keep stuff taunted off most people, with the notable exception of one iksar monk i grouped with who has some NICE weapons  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>I'm just askin Verant to leave it alone. They finally put in a weapon quest that most anyone can do, and that ends up iwith a very nice weapon.
