</FONT><HR>Ummmmmmm cough *bull***** cough.  as one of the very few people who have seen the epic pet in action, ya its pretty mean. Maybe even a little too mean. But there is a few things that I would like to point out:<P>1) Mage Epic is FAR and away the most difficult to aquire, anyone who would argue this is just not looking at the quests. (go get a walkthrough, there not that hard to find)<P>2) Mages at the highest level are severally underpowered offensivly. (simple fact) NOBODY should outdamage a mage in any period of time, mages sacrifice everything for there offensive power, the lack of defence combined with the HUGE risks associated with controling a pet(don't belive me ask your local enchanter).<P>3) Mages ARE balanced IMHO(ok not so humble eh what ya gonna do)with the pet in the end game.<P>4) this is an improvement on there most potent ability, this is the equivlent of giveing wizards an 800 pt dd that casts in 6 seconds for free. I don't think many would have wined about that.<P>5) In epic encounters all the pure melee's still do more damage do to level differentials. With rouges still doing a significant amount more.<P>6) Thogg I think you should change your posting name becuase your trollish nature is far to well known and you won't get any serious responses from anyone unless that person is at work and extremely bored.<P>Thank you<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Thogg:<P>"There are SIX mages who need only to go to island 7 in sky to finsih there epics kredal."<P>So in other words there are 0 mages that have the epic item correct?<P>If 7th island in sky is so easy why haven't they done it yet?  Well, that's because it isn't easy.  It takes a whole lot longer to get to 7th island of sky than to kill a dragon.<P>Even if all 6 of these mages did get their epic, are they all in the same guild?  I doubt it.  Are even 2 of them in the same guild?  How is this going to be overpowering?<P>Do you think that because a guild has 1 or maybe even 2 mage epic weapons that suddenly every post 50+ warrior will become useless on that server?<P>Have you forgot that most groups don't even want the mage to summon their pet?  God forbid that mages might become a viable part of a raid or epic event.  No we wouldn't want that.<P>Unless it's been changed I'm pretty sure that most raids and epic events need more than one or 2 tanks.  It's not like 100's of mages are going to be walking around with these.  I would be shocked if more than 10 mages per server ended up with their epic 6 months from now.<P>The drop on the Inny staff, the pegasus cloak, and the crown from 7th isle will see to that.  Thanks, for the big whine though.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Not how many are close, but that actually have it.<P>I think this number will speak to how hard this epic quest is to finish.

I have watched a 59 paladin "used rune sword once, then used som next time" take ever pet a mage has including the epic.. Reason the monk an war died are because they were usein low dmg weapons with fast dly and the dmg shield ate them alive, give them a heavy hitting 2hs an they will kill your pet.<P>Tyner 56 Paladin<BR>      51 Mage</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The whole point wasn't that the mage epic was too powerful, it was that the warrior epic just sucks.  I personally don't care that mage pets can put a level 60 warrior to shame.  That's life.  Warriors have been dealing with this from the start.  Pets have always been better than warriors so who cares?  It's a sad state of events when warriors choose to leave their epic weapons in their bags for weapons.  I'd rather that the hit to my stats and be able taunt of the monks and rogues by using a jade mace than have great stats and not get aggro.  Our 'class defining' weapon makes it so we can't get enough taunt (in some cases) with the damage it puts out.  Sounds like an item that is the antithesis to class defining to me. Sure once it procs we can get aggro but when the rogue and monk are already dead by the time you proc we don't really care.  I'd be extatic if they'd take the lame proc off and give us a better damage/delay.  I don't even care about haste which warriors, unlike every other melee epic, don't get.  Even taking the damage sheild of the mage epic pet out of the equasion warriors STILL are far behind in the epic department.  And don't give me the, "Our epic is harder to get than yours".  That doesn't even enter into the equasion.  If it did the warriors are getting a harder shaft than before.  I know both quests quite well.  Here's a little comparison:<P>Mages need rare staves off Inny and Phinigel.  The Inny staff is difficult but Phin is a pushover.  On Mith Marr three people killed Phin less than a week ago.  Yes they were 60's (Warrior, Cleric, and Bard I believe) but it still goes to show that he's a pushover.<P>Warriors need rare drops off of Maestro and the Golems in Fear.<P>Mages need rare drops off spawns (Quillmane and Undertow).  The camp for these just sucks.  Undertow isn't so bad but Quillmane you have to fight with every single newb in the zone for.  Quillmane is soloable but Undertow you'll need a small group to keep it clear.<P>Warriors need rare drops off spawns (Mountain Giant Patriarch, Ice Giants, Goblin Wizard).  Just as rare as the Quillmane and Undertow drops but warriors can't solo any of their mobs.<P>Mages have a long boring solo camp in Najena, Kith, Mistmore, and Unrest for not so common drops off of greenie mobs.<P>Warriors have to buy 7K to 10K worth of items (Diamond, Jacynth, Black Sapphire, and two rebreathers).  Sure we don't have to sit in najena killing the same mobs over and over again but then again we have to go camp for money and need to find a group to do so.  I'd personally spend the time killing the greenies (if I could without dying) than sitting and trading for stuff.  Warriors get a break here.<P>Both Mage and Warrior need to go all over the place doing little side quests.  The warrior quest though has no point.  There is no central theme, no clue where to go or what to do.<P>Both Mage and Warrior need drops from Sky.  The warrior drop, Spiroc Blade off the Spiroc Lord is much easier to get but a much rarer drop.  I still think warriors get a small break here.<P>To offset the warriors getting a little easier time in Sky and the buying vs. camping bits warriors have to kill the queen in chardok for another rare drop.  This balances out the edge warriors had in difficulty.<P>I'm not complaining about the difficulty here.  I love that our epics are hard to get.  It is fabulous that the quests for epic weapons are just that: epic.  The fact that warriors don't use their epics should be a sign that there is something wrong.  That is all Thogg was trying to get to.  Make it a little more epic.  Get rid of that stupid, pointless proc, and make them 10/18 weapons.  Heck, make them 9/18 weapons on scale with a weapon that every warrior has anyhow.  Leave the mage epic alone but take a serious look at the warrior epic.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Don't worry though guys and gals there are at least 5 or 6 places where I can't use my pet and we need to buck up and use the inferior warrior in place of. At least until Im given more control over my pet, Yes it will happen wait and see.

</FONT><HR>Ok the pet isn't quite that strong.<P>I was with the first magcian to get the epic on Drinal (happened last night) and we were all very excited and imediatly ran some tests.<P>First of all don't use jade maces against a mob with a 60 pt ds, thats just stupid. No wonder the warrior was wiped out. A wizard can beat a warrior in a mele if he has a 60 pt ds up duh! We tested the pet against a lvl 60 warrior appropriately equiped (can't remember the exact weapon) and it was very close. Both warrior and pet were under a bubble when warrior kicked in his disc and finished off the pet. <P>We also tested it against a lvl 59 monk with staff and it was also very close although the monk would've lost by a sliver.<P>Now for some facts about the pet. It doesn't BS but instead gets high kicks sorta like monks do. Highest kick we saw was 145 damage.<P>To test resists we had a lvl 60 wizard (me) casting at the pet. Unfortunately it doesn't share the poison imunity that water pets have or the fire imunity that fire pets have. It is fairly magic resistant and partially resisted most magic based draughts. It took on average of 4 attempts to root it, and was even harder to snare. <P>As far as what thogg mentioned about it going balistic and hitting very hard every once and a while i can neighther confirm or deney. We only tested it for 30 min or so and in that time didn't see any really high hits with the exception of the kicks. My guess would be that its some kind of disc that only goes off so often.<P>Mysthyl</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Glad to see the many sensible replies to this.<P>Before Kunark, as a mage, I used to say I thought the game was unfairly balanced to casters.<P>However, Verant may have gone too far fixing that in the direction of melee post-Kunark. How popular are mages for groups and raids compared to warriors, other than if one is needed for call of the hero? That answers it.<P>I've no problem with the question being raised about the warrior epic, but the mage epic seems not overpowered at this point. I'd be interested BTW in independant tests of epic pet versus krup, with no casting from the mage...<P>BTW I'm one of the mages who "only" needs the crown from air (using a friend's quillmane cloak).<BR>However I've led a good number of air raids, and while I've got many warriors their blades, I've never yet been to isle 7... we have 1 mage epic on our server.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

If someone actually takes the time to wade through your tone (don't know why I do, guess I'm just bored), then they can see you have a point.<P>If your intention is anything more than to annoy people, try some well-written posts, rather than the whiny and misspelled ones that are becoming synonymous with your name.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055028-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055028.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055028-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055028&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055028&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
