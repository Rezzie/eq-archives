&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>On Monday January the 9th of 2001 my Clerical Epic Weapon Quest was at the final battle stage where I was to present a shimmering pearl to Zordak Ragefire in Solusek B (Nagafen’s Lair) on the Bertoxxulous server and defeat him in both human and dragon form.  <P>To reach this stage took over 150 man hours of myself and my guild. The hardest point was the assault of the Overking in Chardok which took 6 full groups of level 50+ people to safely complete and obtain the piece I needed there.<P>So I handed the pearl to Zordak and he attacked me, as other clerics had warned me he would do. We engaged Zordak in his human form and slew him easily. But he then respawned in his dragon form "Zordakalicus Ragefire" and a second battle was upon us. Because we had prepared properly and brought sufficient force we succesfully slew Zordakalicus. But there was one very large problem … the person who landed the killing blow , a warrior named Auratus, was linkdead due to the number of players and lag that had occured and as a result the corpse of the dragon disappeared (or poofed as people call it) without me being able to loot the heart I needed for the last piece of my quest.<P>This was a great tragedy as I’m sure you can imagine. Everyone was very upset, myself included. In fact I seriously pondered quitting EQ at that point. Its not that this one weapon meant so much to me, but it was that so much TIME was invested by SO MANY people that it was earth shattering. Imagine if you worked for 4 weeks and expected a paycheck at the end of that period but due to an accounting error you did not get paid? This is the feeling .. all the risk, the time, the dedication, the camping and staring at one spot on the ground waiting for that rare monster … was lost in a moment of bad coding.<P>I /petitioned the problem to the GM and got a response from a guide named Raea. Raea informed me my server GM was not on that night and they themselves could not help me. I should re-petition the issue on Wednesday between the hours of 2pm and 11pm PST to get some assistance.<P>I logged off very heart heavy but determined to try, I felt sure that the GM would respond in a helpful manner. This was a bug, not something we had done wrong.<P>I logged on at 2:15 PST on Wednesday and /petitioned my issue. I had to reissue my petition 4 times .. as I did not get a response until close to 7pm PST (I have read on the official message boards that petitions will expire from the queue in 2 hours so I refreshed my petition once every hour and 45 minutes to be safe). <P>I did not mind waiting 5 hours for my answer because much to my pleasure the GM after telling me they were ‘looking in to the matter’ appeared and put the pearl into my trade window. I clicked "trade" and began to type a thank you but they had dissapeared. I tried to thank them anyways but they were gone and I felt bad that I could not thank them. That pearl represented another chance at redeeming 150 hours of my guilds’ time.<P>So on Friday the 12th of January 2001 we met again in Solusek B. We buffed and meditated, and gathered about Zordak Ragefire yet again in Nagafen’s Lair. This time he would be mine, this time I would complete my quest!<P>I wont go into length because the story is simple .. this time a guildmate named Zarux went linkdead and got the killing blow of Zordakalicus Ragefire and the corpse poofed yet again.<P>Everyone  in my guild was shocked. That this could happen twice in a row was utterly unbelievable. I think half the guild petitioned at the moment, every last one of us was highly upset. Every last one of us was intimately effected by the effort that had been destroyed by this bug. I too /petitioned the issue and we waited for a GM to assist us.<P>We were quite lucky (we thought) to see the same GM who had restored my previous pearl by the name of Rhuyai appear to help us.<P>However Rhuyai told me that he would not replace my pearl a second time. Rhuyai claimed that people were exploiting the fact that Ragefire was poofing and having other clerics loot the heart, and then asking for a new pearl. <P>I have no idea whether that is true or not. But I asked Rhuyai to check the server ‘audit trail’ or server ‘log’ as they call it. I have read on the official Everquest message boards that some things can be verified by GM’s in the logs. Rhuyai did not respond to that request, he simply restated that he could not reimburse me a second time. <P>I was upset, but very polite with him. I asked how I could escalate this issue. He gave me the eqmail@verant.com address, and we parted ways.<P>I then related this information to my guild, and they were not pleased. Every last one of the 30 people we had there that night had spent many hours helping me do that quest .. and quite a few of them sent additional /petitions.<P>Rhuyai appeared again to us, and this time my guild took up the argument with  him. I think Rhuyai thought I had not explained to my guild what he had explained to me .. but I had. They simply did not like that answer (neither did I to tell the truth.) My guild was very demanding.. and brought up many valid issues ..including why could he not check the log and verify that no one had looted any dragon loot. Why could he not verify that Zarux was linkdead and had gotten the killing blow, and therefore know that there was absolutely no possibility of there being a corpse? <P>We had not exploited anything and my guild made many strong and heart felt arguments in this regard.<P>Rhuyai then summoned the assistance of Lead GM Axgoreth. Axgoreth gave us the same answers, but tried to do so more authoritatively. Axgoreth again would not verify any information in the log, and claimed that they were unable to verify anything in the log. <P>The root of the problem lies in Verants code. And I believe they know about it.  Let me explain why this happens.<P>Have you ever seen a Goblin and a Sarnak fighting in Kunark? Sometimes you just run up and there they are duking it out!  Well when one of them wins the corpse of the one who lost ‘poofs’. It dissapears. The reason for this is obvious.. if it did not then you the player would get ‘free loot’. There are also probably a few other reasons, such as reducing server lag by not having NPC corpses on the ground that were not player generated.<P>Well have you ever had a group mate go linkdead during a fight? I’m sure you have. Well if someone goes linkdead during a fight.. and they are getting hit.. they don’t stop fighting do they? No instead the will keep fighting the monster, and if the monster runs away they chase it. <P>When a player goes linkdead, the server turns them into an NPC until they are disconnected from the server. <P>Now this doesn’t happen _that_ often normally. But when you get 5 groups of people together and fight something like a Dragon who is using Area Effect breath weapon spells.. well the fact is its almost certainly going to happen. I cant remember a single dragon fight I’ve been in that someone hasn’t gone linkdead.<P>Verant put linkdead PC’s on the same code as NPC’s. When Auratus and Zarux got the killing blows vs the Epic Dragon we were killing the same code caused that corpse to dissapear. <P>This is not my fault. Its not an exploit. This is code done by your company, Verant Inc. <P>I have followed the steps, I have taken the time. I have spent my hours and hours of time and dedication to show I am ‘worthy’ of the reward. My guild has spent months of time building the proper people and levels and equipment under Verants rules to be capable of doing this.<P>And finally when we reach the final battle because Verant did not write separate linkdeath code the corpse dissapears?<P>Its apparent to me that this is a ‘bug’. Now Verant has said in the past they *will* help recover items from known bugs. At the same time they have also said they *will not* help with Epic Quests.<P>This leaves me in a boggle. You see .. I’m a customer. I pay for several things with my subscription. I pay for a game that works, I pay for customer service. I do not pay Verant to be treated like a liar and scam artist.<P>When you have knowlege that a problem occured due to your code, why on earth would you make a policy refusing to reimburse it? <P>You can claim that this problem is due to players internet connectivity problems, However I would beg to differ. I call that negligent coding on your part. It is entirely within Verants powers to give the kill to the group that did the most damage. You have made the coding choice to cause corpses to poof. Players do not make the choice to go linkdead from information overflow during  a battle so hard it takes 30 people to complete.<P>Yes we all turned down every option, turned off every filter we could. But people still go linkdead.<P>I see there are posts on the offical EQ boards form other servers having the same exact problem. Ragefire’s corpse is ‘poofing’. I see also posts on some of the Cleric related fan sites that his corpse is poofing. I am not alone in this. I am not the only person who has spent hundreds of man hours to complete a quest that you have ‘designed and tested’ (or so you claimed) and have empty hands at its final stages.<P>Many people were upset tonight and a few of them said things that upset people will say. <P>Your GM threatened to disband my guild if they had more than 1 person petition a problem in the future.  He will claim it is not a threat, however when you tell us "I can have your guild disbanded if you continue to have multiple people petition a problem in the future" we all consider that  a threat.<P>He used the rationalization that this only effected one person. We the customers, who pay  you a collective $296 dollars a month who were on that raid tell you that this problem effected every single one of us there on that raid. I as a customer reserve the right to complain to you for customer service if I so desire. If my guildmate feels this problem effected him as well how on earth can you tell him he is not permitted to petition?<P>I waited 5 hours on Wednesday to get a response from my petition, my guild was very upset and I would guess 15 or so people petitioned on Friday. I would hope that your customer service staff would fully understand the impact a bug of this nature would have on us. I would hope they can click ‘delete’ on a few messages in the queue for the same event and bear some tolerance for a large group of customers who are upset. The time that we as players have I invested in this quest is exponentially larger than the time your customer service team has spent trying to resolve it. The time we as players have spent trying to do this quest is also larger than the time you the developers have spent testing it, or coding it. (And by we as players I mean the player base)<P>If 30 people bought bus tickets to Reno and the bus didn’t show up I can guarantee you all 30 of those people would complain at the ticket counter. And you can be sure that the ticket salesman wouldn’t threaten to cancel their trip if they didn’t stop complaining. You owe us customer service.  You made this game, now please do your duty.<P>Please treat me like a human being, please respect my feelings. Please also respect the feelings of the 30 people who came on my quest to help me and who also spent many hours of their time on that same quest.<P>I don’t want to attack you in this request, however I do demand that I be treated properly. Please take what I am saying in the spirit it is intended and that is a firm but polite request for proper customer service and reimbursal of an item that was destroyed due to a bug in your code.<P>I sincerely hope you address the issue with Ragefire’s corpse poofing. My guild has 2 other clerics who are now ready to perform this step of the quest but they are terrified to even attempt it due to the two failures that I have had. <P>Yes that’s right.. we are terrified to play your game. <P>Can you please fix it? Can you please also reimburse me? <P>Please.<P>Respectfully,<P>Badina of Bertox <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I was part of the tragedy Badina describes.<P>I respect the GMs, and recognize they have great challenges to deal with.  I also respect my guildmates, many of whom invested a great deal of effort and time into getting Badina and two other clerics in our guild to this point.  <P>I'm not faulting the GM's: perhaps their hands are tied.  They seemed to honestly want to help, but couldn't: not a second time.  The rules they work by may not make sense, and perhaps someone should be given a stern talking to about those rules, but the poor GM can only do so much.<P>What I hope will happen now:<P>1) no one else will attempt Ragefire until the problem is fixed<BR>2) Verant will announce officially that the problem exists, and that they are working on it.  I would even suggest that they should disable Ragefire until they have the problem corrected, to prevent anyone from losing their pearls<BR>3) Verant will promptly fix the problem, and announce when it is safe to challenge Ragefire once again<P>I would, of course, be most pleased if my friend and guildmate Badina received a replacement pearl.  I would willingly submit to any investigation of my inventory, history logs, what have you, as I am sure any member of our guild would.  But I don't expect this to happen: it seems that Verant is more concerned about the possibility of someone (??) somehow looting the corpse and claiming that it poofed (what, they can't verify this???) then they are about the hundreds of hours of lost time this represents for their customers.<P>Paeter</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

If that's the case then the people who made this incredible new logging system don't know the first thing about programming for a game like this.)<P>This is one of the only places where CS reps can hide behind an avatar and I think it reflects very poorly on them to see how they behave when they're not held accountable for their actions by the company they work for.  Shame on Verant.  If the log isn't keeping track of what's being looted or who killed the dragon and who was linkdead when, then what the hell are the logs there for?

</FONT><HR>Bravo! A very well written post indeed.  I sincerely hope that a blue name reads this and shows the VI Management EXACTLY why we are all so upset with customer service issues as of late.<P>&lt;Rant on&gt;<BR>My guild too was threatened by Guide Nangwaya.  A few of us petitioned because this GM changed a guildmambers name 3 times in a 30 minute period.  The ORIGINAL name of the player had been changed to what he had at this time to him by a LEAD GM.<P>While he was upset to have his name changed (Level 52.. your name tends to be know by a lot of people, and to have it changed can kill your reputation) ,all he asked was that he be allowed a name he could be happy with.  This guide changed it to 3 seperate names, not of his choosing, then refused to answer his petition to have it changed to the name he WANTED, which was nothing more than adding a "g" into the name.  Several of the guild also petitioned since this guide would not answer our mate.  Eventually, the guide told the "victim" to tell us to stop petitioning or he would start issuing warnings or bannings.<P>Since when is /petition a bannable offence?  When did it become bannable to show dissatisfaction to a customer service rep, PRIVATELY in a petition or /tell?  No one was swearing, no one was being obnoxious about it, no one was threatening.  All we wanted to know was 1. WHY the name was changed, it was not violating any verant policy; and 2. Why wouldn't the Guide give our mate a name he could live with and feel good about, especially since it only contained a single letter more than what the guide changed his name to anyways?<P>I work in sales, if I told dissatisfied customers off, threatened to disconnect thier service because they complained, etc I wouldn't have a JOB.  <P>Verant, I implore you to become MORE customer service oriented.  Stop Guides from threatening the player population, your customers.  Train your guides on appropriate behavior, stop the guides from beleiving EVERYONE is guilty until proven innocent.  Gestapo tactics that are currently in effect WILL be the death of this game once there are other places for people to go where they aren't treated like dirt by your staff.<P>And fix the Ragebringer.  I am tired of hearing the poor clerics come back to Burning Woods telling the zone that the corpse poofed.  It is an OBVIOUS problem, admit to it, suck it up, and reimburse those who have lost their pearls, and fix the coding.<P>&lt;/end rant&gt; </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Fixing uber mob corpse poofing should be #1 on Verant's 'to do' list. There simply has to be a better way of handling a player LD, it may be difficult and time consuming to code but they damn well owe us it.<P>In this particular case those logs need to be examined by a lead GM and if the story is proved true and the second corpse did poof then the GM who accused the player of cheating should be warned and suspended.<P>*** gives you the right Verant to accuse your customers of cheating/exploiting when you're just too damn lazy to check logs etc? Oh, I forgot, the 'right' is the fact you have no decent MMORPG competiton so we're pretty much stuck here with your arrogance.

</FONT><HR>Badina, I'm exactly at the same point as you. Ragefire's corpse poofed twice on me, and our server GM just told me he can't give pearl back the second time.<P>One of the guides told me "it shouldn't happen again" before I got the pearl back the first time. GM who got my pearl back even offered me to be there when I do the Ragefire again, but everybody knows that's impossible because of Ragefire's random spawn (no GM was available when I tried the second Ragefire).<P>I'm trying to contact the supervisor of my server GM right now. Does Verant really think that NOT giving pearl back to the loyal customers is better than letting them quit the game? Do they really think that we are exploiting it while 30+ people can testify that we're not? What "proof" do they want? They can't check the log, they can hardly be there when we kill Ragefire. Verant, please. Just put yourselves into our shoes.<P>Badina, I'll let you know what happens with the supervisor of my server GM. Please keep us informed on your situation.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Venkemen - whilst I haven't read all the myriad of ragefire poofing threads in those that I have read I haven't seen a blue name response. I may be wrong but I've yet to see Verant acknowledge the problem let alone give a timeframe for fixing it. Given that it's a little unreasonable to expect people to effectively indefinetly delay getting an item that has a major role in the 50+ game. Ragefire certainly doesn't poof everytime, just enough to be a major headache to a lot of innocent players.<P>Dain Frostreaver is another frequent poofer but at least the amount of time in killing him is much smaller than it takes to get to the point where you can spawn Ragefire.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Venkmen:<P>Ragefire poofing has been a *player* documented problem for quite some time.  The only Verant responses to day, from Absor, were along the lines of "I thought we had code to fix poofing of big mobs?  I'd better ask about this again...".  This was a couple of weeks ago.<P>There was rumoured to be some corpse poofing coding changes in the last patch.  That's why we tried it again.  Obviously, the rumoured changes either weren't applied or didn't work for Ragefire.<P>So, thus far, Verant has not clearly stated that corpse poofing in general, or Ragefire in particular, are a bug of any kind.  Nor have they made any real commitments to fixing it.  The implication at this point is that they consider this to be a "feature", which somehow makes this game more "exciting".<P>I don't consider corpse poofing due to player link deaths to be improving this game in any way.  I suspect the majority of players would say the same.  <P>I want Badina to get a replacement shimmering pearl.  Even more importantly, I want Verant to examine this problem, immediately make a public pronouncement that Ragefire poofing is buggy and/or take steps to prevent people from losing any further pearls, and of course I want them to fix it.  <P>Hopefully, if enough attention can be brought to this problem something will be done.  <P>Paeter</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I believe you should be imbursed, but these logs may not actually exist and therefor they can't check.  I've ONLY seen Verant mentions "logs"  when you've done something wrong, and NEVER when you ask them to use it to show that you're not lying.  I had a GM say that I was /petitioned for using crude lanaguage, and he checked the logs and I had said f*** repeatedly.  I was only on 10 min before hand and the worst word I used was "sucks".  For this reason I doubt the GM can do anything for you, as the logs probably don't exist.  She can't answer you without admiting she was wrong, so it is VERY unlikely you will ever be talked to by a GM on this issue again.  Verant refuses to admit it is their fault until people start quiting, and even then it takes awhile.  Go back and redo the 3 week quest, its faster than waiting for a GM.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yup, that sucks, hope you get reimbursed. Even though nothing went wrong on the last Ragefire fight I helped out on, we actually had a guide standing around watching the fight. If you get reimbursed your pearl you might want to petition and see if you can get a guide or gm to sit in on the fight, at least then there will be no argument if the LD error occurs again.<P>Not sure whats up with these logs but they only ever seem to be used to convict someone, and never used to help i.e. LD player getting killing blow on mob. Why are they so eager to use them against players, but for some reason say 'ummmm, we can't check the logs for that, so can't help you' when a player needs help.<P>I'm in the middle of killing the Celestials for my monk epic. If some bug caused me to lose my Whistling Fist robe without awarding me my epic and gms weren't willing to help me, I'd quit without hessitation. If a retail outlet had this form of customer service they wouldn't stay in business long...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I just got an e-mail from lead GM saying they can't reimburse pearl for the second time.<P>He said he gave me back the pearl the first time giving me "the benefit of doubt"... does that mean they automatically assume we are exploiting?<P>He also said Verant hasn't confirmed this issue. I think it would be very easy to witness this problem if one of the guides/GMs could attend some Ragefire raids. It seems like they are not actively pursuing to fix the problem.<P>I just can't understand Verant's priority...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is pretty ridiculous. If ANYONE reads that first post, it's pretty obvious there is a problem here.<P>Please please Verant, if you care so much about the results of high level encounters that you risk some of your highest level people (and in my case Rolant, one of the best and nicest clerics on the server) quitting you NEED to do something about it.<P>Classify your encounters. When an epic encounter (where you really care about the outcome) spawns, write some log entry with what loot they spawned with. Then, when the corpse is looted, log each loot. <P>If you had that, it would be obvious that Rolant and any cleric who had the problem would deserve their pearl back and a hearty apology. There'd be a spawn of Zordakalicious Ragefire and no resulting looting. If you believe for half a second that it rotted or that the cleric who spent all the time to get to this point camping for rares in Sol A and Rathe and killing such hard things as the Overking and Ixblat Fer and turned in their pearl would forget to loot their last piece, you have got to be kidding me.<P>Defaulting to someone cheating you may be ok for someone wanting their BBC back or their Silvery War Ax recreated, but this is the last step in the epic quest for Clerics. At least do some due diligence before saying "I'm sorry" because if you say I'm sorry, you're driving people from the game. If you don't have the tools or mechanisms in place to do that due dilligence, then get to freakin' work and make it so you do. This needs to stop.<P>If you're worried about people cheating on epics to twink them, then make them all like the enchanter quest. No drop items and combining before hand in. I can honestly say I enjoyed the whole enchanter epic and am very proud when people I don't know congratulate me on my serpent staff. It makes me feel sick to know Rolant has put in just as much work only to be told he must start over because of a known bug [1].<P>- Pini Uldar, witness to Rolant's second Ragefire poof<P>Pini Uldar, 52 Gnomish Illusionist<BR>Gnert Iglewike, 32 Gnomish Wizard<BR>Kerith Llylwn, 24 High Elven Cleric of Tunare<BR>Idus, 14 Erudite Paladin of Quellious<BR>Guild Amicus - Tunare Server<P>[1] Known Bug reference: <BR>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045210.html<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047582-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047582-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/047582-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=047582&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=047582&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
