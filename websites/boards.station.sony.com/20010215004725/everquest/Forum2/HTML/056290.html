</FONT><HR>You can read the previous discussion here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055864.html<BR>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056034.html<P><BR>Author Topic: Necromancer Talk <BR>Absor<BR>Station Member posted 02-07-2001 10:08 AM <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>So let's talk about necromancers.<BR>As with all the other threads, I want to talk about class balance here, not about bugs or epic weapons. You may certainly present bugs and concerns about the epic weapons, but they will not be the main concern of this thread.<P>Unlike the other threads, I have a fairly good list of ideas already garnered from several other posts to start us out. It is not complete, I'm sure. But it is certainly a good place to start our discussion.<P>Also, we are not looking to make necromancers any more effective at soloing than they already are. And, well, the necromancer is a pretty powerful class as they are now. The primary issues that I see revolve around the battle with the boss monsters. But I certainly want to hear from necromancers with concerns about all levels of the game. And, once again, I have to warn you that since we will be looking closely at this class we may very well feel that something needs to have its power reduced to achieve balance.<P>Anyhow, here's what I have already.<P>Ignite Bones: Despite the coolness factor, this spell can't really be used on the big raids because it suddenly pulls the enemy out of range, and by the time you relocate your range, one warrior could conceivably have done more damage than the spell is going to do. The best solution is to make the skeleton match the monster, if we can find some way to do that. Fixing this one spell might solve a lot of concerns. If we can’t size the skeleton, then we probably should remove it and find some other cool way to make sure that the spell 'sticks' to the target to prevent chain casting and to make it more than just another DD. Note: Any change to this spell should also be made to Chill Bones (55).<P>Lifetaps: The number one request is to allow Lifetaps to land on the big monsters. If we are telling necromancers that they have a valid place at the final encounter because they can give mana to other casters, then they will need a way to regain mana. Lich and Lifetap are the way they do that now. I am not convinced that this is something that we should change. But this is the single most asked for thing by the necromancer community. Perhaps, if made in conjunction with the fixing the bug in Lich, then perhaps this could be balanced.<P>DoTs and corpse poofing: This affects everyone. Hopefully this is now much improved, but I’m not taking it off the list until I’m convinced it has been fixed.<P>Mana transfer: Again, if their ‘place’ against the boss mob is to transfer mana, then perhaps we should allow them to do it at a better rate. A 2:1 transfer rate might be enough. I'm not at all certain that this should be done in conjunction with any change to Lifetaps in those encounters, though, as a change in one makes the other far more effective and might just be too much of a change. But this could certainly be considered if we fix the bug with the Lich spells.<P>Infusion: Make infusion targetable. The necro might still see it as a 'worthless spell', but if another caster wants to sacrifice their experience for 1000 mana, they might actually cast this spell. Otherwise, those Essence Emerald’s will only be used for raising the dead.<P>Defoliation: There seem to be plenty of plants that this just doesn't work on. I fully understand how we need to limit the use of any spell that is overly efficient against any one monster type. But it might be worthwhile to evaluate the things that are not considered plants that maybe should be. I've asked the players for a list that they'd like reviewed, but I've received nothing yet.<P>Track Corpse: Broken spell. Is it going to stay that way?<P>Epic Weapon: The look and effect are not well loved in the community.<P>Lich Series: This series of spells is broken. It is more powerful than it should be. It takes the necromancer's hit points and turns them into mana. It was calculated at a certain ratio to be 'in balance'. Unfortunately, these spells were adversely affected by the reduction of damage to spells used by players on players. This change also reduced the hit points taken from the necromancer by Lich spells, so that the ratio of mana gained for hit points lost is nearly 1 for 1 (instead of about 3 for 2). This is a bug that we have chosen not to change in the past because it would be a 'nerf'. I think in conjunction with a serious look at the entire class and the balance of all the classes, we should also look at this series and decide if we should put it right. If it remains as it is, the necromancer is going to be limited in the improvements it can gain, as the class is already using a powerful and broken spell series. Note: Series includes: Arch Lich (60), Demi Lich (60), Lich (49), Call of Bones (34), Allure of Death (20).<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1. MAKE TOUCH OF NIGHT(59th lifetap) IRRESISTIBLE. it has a horrible ratio and a long cast time. increase the recast if you want. screw all the &lt;L59 necros. you shouldnt be raiding uber mobs (L60+) until then anyway imo. this gives incentive to players to achieve that status and gives high level necros what they want and deserve. simple to<BR>code this too; touch of night=malo savewise. if JUST THIS change goes through you will have content necros across all servers.<P>2. ignite/chill bones. remove the illusion altogether. no one gives a crap about it except the 44th necro who just got it. and up dmg on chill bones to around 700-750.<P>3. don't change anything in the lich series. someone posted this already: a two-year bug is not a bug.<P>4. mana-transfer.. GET RID OF IT! thats not our job. thats the GD bone you threw at low level necros cause they could not find a damn group.<P>5. PETS -- 59th pet needs to be on par with mage pets. i.e. higher hp/ac/resists/dmg per hit. mages still have the advantage since theirs will cost lower mana and less costly regeants.<P>6. EPIC - add 40-65hp. change the look to something more relevant to a necro. effect should be either: touch of night, conjure corpse(no coffin), encyclopedia necrothurgia effect x2.<P>7. VERANT! dont kid yourself. you arent trying to please all necros with this thread, just 59+ ones. the ones that are most profitable are the ones who are casual and arent saying anything. this isnt about them. if you want the countless *****ing threads to stop then satisfy the high level necro community.<P>THERE YOU HAVE IT, I JUST BALANCED THE NECRO CLASS FOR FREE.<P>Warlock, Prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>In my opinion, I always considered Necros as Mage/Enchanter hybrids- they have spells common to both classes but they are appropriate to the class.<P>I could not read all the posts but here are my suggestions:-<P>A)  Make -=ALL UNDEAD=- immune to normal fear.  This will include necro pets, zombies speccys etc.  The exception being the spook the dead line of spells- which makes sense to an old AD&D player like me.<P>b)  Mages's DD improve above 44- necros do not.  I suggest, to improve a necros role in a group, give them an upgrade to screaming terror.  I know enchanters will be screaming themselves- but wouldnt this make enchanters slightly less essential in a raid situation.  Remember, Necros have a very poor CHA so we would never come close to an enchanter for mez power.<P>c)  An enchanters fear always lasts longer than a necros fear- why is that?  Its because of the CHA, I know.  Shouldnt a low CHA be more effective for fear spells?<P>d)  Give the 59 speccy pet a decent lifetap- probably the 49 one to justify its casting cost.<P>E)  Please change the 24 shock of poison to Evocation?  It will give us necros the chance to practice the skill without too much hassle ready for lv 44.<P>F)  Move Chill Bones down to lv 51.  Its too similer to Ignite bones.<P>Thank you for listening.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor stop skimming and please read this thread.<P>Absor nice work with all the talk threads it must be a lot of work.<P>Ok i have some necro concerns.  I am a 56th level iksar necro on Rodcet Knife and feel that i know the class very well.<P>First I know you are looking for ways to help the raiding necro and not the solo necro so i will focus on that.  <P>1. Group Dead Man Floating.  This spell would just reduce tedium (i know you like reducing tedium)<P>2.  Before touching the lich line please look at clarity 2 and see if lich will still be used.  If it takes to many hps away it will become to costly to keep the spell up and we wont use it and instead will use clarity 2.  I dont believe that this is something you or any of the community wants.<P>3.  How about just making 54+ lifetaps get the special resist check.  While some after 54 still solo many do not also when soloing lifetaps are not a factor it is dark/fear/dots/pet.  Also anything post 54 i can solo i can already stick lifetaps on.  (The main reason i am requesting a resist change is its a way for us to heal ourselves not do lots of dmg).<P>4.  Why cant Ignite Bones stack with eachother (after illusian is removed)? it already has a very long casting time and high resist rate.<P>5.  Track corpse was fixed a while ago.  Thanks<P>6. Defoliation- PoG mobs and shrooms in seb.<P>7.  I know you are in favor of giving pet immunity to fear to mages.  Good for them.  How about you just make the 59 pet (emmasary of thule) immune to fear.  This pet costs a perdoit and 2 bone chips to cast and is only marginaly better than our 49 pet.  This would make it a very good raid spell but yet would not help soloing.  After all this is the emmasary of cazic thule himself.<P>8. If you do nerf the lich series and raise the efficency on manatransfer you essentially do nothing to increase our trasnfering because the 2 effects neutralize eachother.  Just keep this in mind.<P>9.  Lastly corpse summoning.  Conjure corpse (level 57) should be lowered in level a little.  maybe to 55 or 54.  We recieve our first summon corpse spell at 39 and earlier upgrade might be in order (again not much of a solo benifit). Also one more thing on coffins.  Can we get coffins placed in maybe 1 or 2 more cities.  Right now necros can go to nerriak to get coffins.  Being an iksar i have no way of getting coffins without makeing a mule to buy them.  I really think making a mule to get something is "cheesy".  Perhaps make the mortician in cabilis sell both coffins or someone in overthere.<P>Thank you for reading this<P>Rekna<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>i HATE soloing.<BR>After 70+ days of play time the only thing that keeps me wanting to still play this game is the sense of community. socializing, grouping and cooperating. yet i have nothing to offer in a group. the only reason i go in some raids and fight in some high lvl dungons is because of my RL friends who have more useful chars and they take me along cause they feel sorry for me. Here is why:<P>1) DoTs do about 1/3 of total dmg since most mobs die in 30 seconds so they are total waste of mana and little contibution. <BR>solution: give us atleast one fast DoT w/ reverse affect of remedy (high dmg, short time, cost lots of mana but at least helps group)<P>2) Ignite bones... think we all know about that one.<P>3) Pets. cast a pet in any high lvl dungons and poeple get ugly on you. and they should. they simply get everyone killed since they are feared all the time and w/ the newer, higher lag and bad pathing dungons they keep getting lost or running away. <BR>solution: the two pet control spells given to mages on test is a great idea. give it to us too ( i have to give credit to Verant, great idea=))<P>4)the night time only spells. they are 100% useless. they are not useless in nature but useless casue i would NEVER med a spell w/ 10 minute recast time that is supposed to save my life but can only be casted at night time. that is just crazy. i have only used these spell once to try them out and have never memed them since. was this the intent of VI? to creat a spell no one would ever use?<P>Solution: remove the night only component. <P>5) Essesnse Emralds. having to use an EE for the necro rez spell makes total since. But sacrifice 5 hours of play time for 1000 mana? or a life tap that BARELY does more dmg than our normal life tabs and gets resisted? makes no sense.<P>Solution: have the last to spells mentioned use a peridot and star ruby...<P>That is all i have to say and thanks a million Verant for at least listening to our thought.<BR>We spend so much time developing our character and it's so important for us to at least get some satisfaction out of it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Powerbait, I am not talking about a "wishlist" for necro's.  Just because I am not lvl 50 does not mean I can't have a valid opinion or argument.  <P>Look at EVERY other class.  They do the things that their classes have always done.  Do necro's?  No, we don't.  That is REALLY my one and only gripe.  Every other class in the game does basicly what they have always done from lvl 1 to lvl 60.  Just look at the spells for the other classes and you will see this is true.  Shaman have always been buffers of the body.  Enchanters are always masters of the mind.  Wizards are always the most powerfull DDers in the game.  Clerics are always healers and buffers of the spirit.  Warriors and other melee classes are always just that.  What are we?  Well from 1 to 50 we are DoT masters and the embodyment of death.  But beyond level 50 we are manastones?  Does anyone else see a problem with this?  Why are WE the only class that makes such a radical departure from our very nature?  And this is what you call "ballence"?  If so, then you need to get a copy of websters because we are the only class that is pretty much useless on high level raids....and these are not even my own words and feelings, rather those voiced by necro's time and time again.   Make us what we are meant to be, make us equal in our own fields to what other classes are in theirs.  Allow our DoTs to be our weapon and the tools of our trade.  Make it so that they stick (according to the targets resistances of course) and don't poof the corpses.  Fix the pathing errors with pets.  And do the countless other things to fix the problems that cause people to not want to group with necro's.  Don't give us horribly inefficient mana transfer spells in a pathetic attempt to make us more desireable for groups.  That is all I ask.  I am not saying how it should be done, only that it should be done.   The "how" and the "what" is up to the programmers.  <P>Fix the pathing errors, make our DoTs behave how they are meant to and the grouping part of things will take care of itself.<P>If you think necro's are nothing more than a support class, ask yourself why most of our spells are damage dealing and not mana management.......</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>   When I first joined Everquest, I made a Necro. Not because I knew they could solo so well, but because it sounded like fun. I don't care for soloing, I don't play an online game to solo, and I would happily give up my solo abilities for a place in a group. Druids can solo too, they have no trouble finding groups, because they bring something to the group. Necros do not. We have nothing to share in groups. DoTs dont do enough damage fast enough to make them worth the mana (with the exception of Venom of the Snake) and the pet is often too much of a hastle, and too dangerous to use.<P>   Please give us something to do so we can contribute. Little things like making Dead Eye, Gather Shadows, and Shadowsight sharable would go a long way. If DoTs didn't take so long to do their damage, (which is probably out of the question since they are so effeciant) that would also help a ton, we could use a few more of them in group situations. Be able to stack DoTs, and Fear Kite doesn't mean anything in a well balanced group, which is what the game is all about. <P>   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Variations for high-end balance:<P>Balance Infusion in comparison to Harvest, 34th level wizard spell, which at these levels gives ~200-300 mana every 10 minutes for no component.  If Infusion requires an Essence Emerald for balance (an idea I like), it should not consume it.<P>Screaming Terror is powerful, but may be seen as impinging on the enchanter's area.  Its original implementation was far more necromantic, but didn't work properly.  With the program changes that have been made since then, would it be possible to go back to the original implementation - not a mesmerization, but an upgrade to Fear that totally cleared the hate list?  If that's possible, then a later upgrade may be appropriate, such as a point-blank area effect version - but I can't see how an upgrade to the current version would be balancing.<P>Our undead-blasting spells, an area in which we should excel, become strangely useless in the mid-levels.  Consider:<BR>Shock of Poison (level 24):  100 mana, 160 damage, all targets, usually hits as it goes against typically low poison resistance.<BR>Dismiss Undead (level 29):  90 mana, 162 damage, undead only, often resisted as it goes against magic resistance.  The undead limitation and high resistance is hardly a fair trade for 10 mana.<BR>Similarly:<BR>Torbas Acid Blast (level 34):  130 mana, 220 damage, all targets.<BR>Expel Undead (level 39):  130 mana, 273 damage, undead only.  Slightly better, but resistance is again an issue, making it an inferior choice to a spell that can hit any target.<P>It seems that either we need these spells much earlier, or the spells themselves should be more effective given the undead-only restriction.  This gets better with the higher level spells.<P>Less of a balance thing but more of a raid thing:  Necromancers would also be good candidates for a kind of Death Pact.  Maybe something like... cast on a party member before battle, when target's HP drop below 0, spell kicks in with 1000 point heal, illusion:skeleton, and a long-lasting DoT that does 100 points/tick.  This effectively lets a necromancer "animate" a dead party member for a very short amount of time - enough to help out in a raid situation, but the target is still going to die.  Pact of the Living Dead?<P>Upgrading all undead everywhere to justify our undead-only lines might make us more wanted (or hated for suggesting it), but I can't imagine it would bring "balance" in any kind of way.  Darned amusing, though.<P>Obligatory balance opinions:  Fix the Lich line, Lifetaps should always land, raidworthy 59 pet.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bril,<P>You have not been there done that.  You did one battle without an Enchanter.  I want an entire raid without one...<P>And I never said they should do equally as well.. read my original post if you didnt get that point.  But they should be able to keep a group alive and fighting just as a druid and shaman would with new improvements.<P>The real problem here is that necros dont want to be told what to do.  They want to tell Verant where they belong in this game.  I know that necros had a big role change in the upper levels...believe me, I know.  But, some creative alternatives to depending on another class cannot hurt.  If you read my first post, I said that I agree with what Absor said was being looked at.  I never wanted to take anything away from that.  All I am sayin is we COULD look at the alternative of giving Necros an upgrade to a spell they already have in an attempt at offsetting the monopoly of Enchanters in a group...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Why do people keep dissing our undead charm spells? Sure, not exactly useful almost everywhere, but where they are (howling stones, plane of hate) they are REAL nice. Higher levels, try going to hate and soloing roamers and assorted other mobs with a charmed Kirakuei... They rule  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Screaming terror imo is fine, though it would be cool to get a higher level version. If we chain cast it, we can keep max 2 mobs mezed. Providing no resists. Anyone who thinks we can keep 3-4 mezed in comparison to a chanter doing it is on crack. Dazzle = 50 seconds or so? ST... 14 seconds.<P>Anyways....<P><BR>We need a lot of our useless spells evaluated. Scent lines = useless, Infusion = useless, Trucidation I wouldn't even use if it didn't use an essence emerald. 15 minute recast time for a 1200 lifetap? Not worth a spell slot. Why does L49 and 59 darkness spells take so long to cast?...<P>Why doesn't Defoliation work on treants in plane of growth? First time I went to POG I was all psyched about finally being able to use my funky L52 plant only nuke on something worthwhile, and it doesn't work on the treants there! pah.<P>Chill bones.. this spell drops?<P>Quivering Veil of Xarn - page 50<P>Our root spells.. I'm still curious why we get Enstill at all. L34 root work six times better then either Paralyzing earth OR enstill. Takes less time to cast, less mana.. who cares that it lasts shorter duration? easy to recast and its so cheap that the cost is negligable.<P><BR>What is the "role" of a necromancer by verant's vision anyways? If its being able to transfer life, mana and such, we need to replace useless spells (like Plague, Defoliate, Scent spells) with upgrades to some of our previous spells. Why no upgrade to Siphon strength? There's an upgrade already programmed called Steal Strength, but its only a weapon proc. Impart strength could use an upgrade too. Also transfer spells for AC, dex, sta and agi would be really cool too. <P>Just some ideas and thoughts</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I do believe that we should have an upgrade to ST. I don’t know about Blue servers but on Red servers, you are lucky to even get two Enchanters on a raid. I remember back when the guild was previously in where killing Phinigel in KK (I was around 51 then). The Monk pulled Phin and four Guardians and the Enchanter was able to shutdown two of the Guardians. The only tank we had was the Monk but he died on the pull so all that was there to tank were two 49 Necro pets and one Shaman pet.<P>There were 12 of us in all and the majority was casters so all they could do is nuke away at Phin while me and the other Necro used ST to mez the other two Guardians. We kept getting resisted a lot but we were able to mez them a few times. The Enchanter died to the other two Guardians just after Phin died so we still had to try and keep the others mezzed. We trained our pets on the ones that weren’t mez and lucky the Wizards had enough mana to nuke them to death.<P>By the time they finished those two, two Wizards were left dead and the other Necro and I were out of mana as well as everybody else. All we could do was let the pets tank the other two Guardians. The Cleric as able to keep the pets healed long enough until the Guardians died.<P>Now before you say that ST worked very well enough for us to have lived through that raid keep this in mind:  <P>A) Kedge Keep difficulty is medium and it is just child’s play compared to places like Chardok and Sebilis. <BR>B) The other Necromancer and I would have had less resistance if we had an upgrade to ST. <BR>C) ST is a very group friendly spell. A whole entire raid shouldn’t fall apart because the Enchanters died.<P>For the people who are going to say see I told that your pets are too powerful, I want them to know that they where buffed by the Cleric and Enchanter and they were healed when they were low on health. The Shaman’s pet lived to by the way.     <P>Whoever the one who said that the Duckstaff is fine the way it is and that nobody has one to complain about has it all wrong. Nobody even wants one PERIOD.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

A pretty helpless feeling to watch someone go LD while running one of these spells and die before they completely disco.  Should we also mention the bug that makes you continue to lose hp even after cancelling the spell?  Having this happen at the end of a bitter fight that you come out oom and almost hp can be fatal.  BTW, this little bug can also pop up with our Words of Darkness item, although rarely.<P>Ignite/Chill Bones - Although the skeletal illusion is pretty cool, it's rather odd to see non-humanoid targets suddenly displaying a humanoid skeleton.  A rather minor quibble compared to the targetting problem, however.  An alternative effect might be, in the case of Ignite Bones, at least, to extend the duration of the flames effect, so the target appears to be awash in flames while the spell remains in effect.  Something similar could be done with Chill Bones.<P>Lifetaps and Uber Mobs - Considering how much damage the melee classes can dish out in the same amount of time a necro can cast most taps, is it really that necessary to make these mobs 100% immune to lifetaps?  Even giving the mobs only a 50% chance of completely resisting the lifetap would be an improvement over how it is now.<P>DoTs - Still cause corpses to poof.  A guildmate of mine was in Fear over the weekend.  Unfortunately for him, the raid leader included a number of newcomers to the planes, who insisted on DoTing stuff.  He'd been hoping for some Carmine.  Instead, he got to watch many Frightfinger corpses go poof.<P>Track Corpse - I'm happy that it works at all, frankly.  A bit hazardous to use in zones like Lavastorm, though, and I'd hate trying to use it in a dungeon.  Something similar to how normal tracking might work a little better.<P>Defoliation - I don't see this as being any more troublesome than undead-specific DD spells.  Considering the lack of worthwhile targets when you get the spell, it's hardly worth having in your spellbook.  If there are undead in the planes of Hate and Fear, why aren't there plants in the Plane of Growth?  On a related note, whatever happened with the 29th level spell, Defoliate?  Would be nice to actually make that spell available.<P>DMF - Perhaps reconsider some of the places where this cannot be cast?  Group DMF would certainly be a cool idea for a spell, but I don't think it would address any balance issues.<P>Targettable Buffs - It would be nice if a few more of our spells could be cast on others.  Deadeye, Gather Shadows, Shadow Sight, and Banshee Aura, perhaps.  Shadow Sight (a spell which grants ultravision, to those not familiar with it), is useless to a dark elf necro.  Making it castable on others would give it a place in my spellbook.  Banshee Aura would be nice if it could be cast on a pet, even.<P>Debuffs - How about an upgrade to the 20th level Shadow Vortex spell?  Making the Scent of X spells a little less resistable might help, too.<P>Screaming Terror - An upgrade to this might be nice, too.  I agree with others in being puzzled why enchanters can't overwrite ST.  Perhaps this should be looked into, as well.<P>Sacrifice & Essence Emeralds - The way it works now, the only people who can use these spells are the ones able to PL up sacrificial lambs for the purpose.  I don't know anyone willing to undergo a rez-less death for my benefit.  This leaves the rest of us out in the cold.  Don't get me wrong, I love the concept, but in practice it leaves something to be desired.  One suggestion might be that, in addition to being usable on a willing player, make Sacrifice usable on an unwilling mob.  Retain the level restrictions, give it a damage component, and require that the spell actually kill the target, leaving no corpse.  Maybe not even always result in an essence emerald, just a chance of it.<P>Epic Weapon - I think its nickname says it all.<P>Thank you for your consideration.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The reason that necros are so effective soloers is that they have too many advantages to do so. A pet, a fear spell, nasty dots, and a form of snaring. Removing one of the components would make the necromancer much more likely to group - this could then be a reason to enhance them in group situations. <P>Removing the engulfing darkness line would be the best way to make a necro more likely to grou pwith others. There is no roleplaying reason for necromancer to have a form of snare spell.<P>Longdead. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As a Necro I can say we are a fairly balanced class already. We are superb in solo(although I think every class deserves to be able to solo well). So we may not be the best at raids, but I think that adds to our "balance". The only real changes that are needed is the corpse poofing. Thats not an issue of balance thats just an all out bug and needs to be fixed, and until it is it should be made mandatory for a GM to repop the particular MOB when the raid group is fully healed/memed and ready to start again. <P>Also, since we are pretty much a "mana battery" I think that it would be beneficial to make our lifetaps have something like a 50/50 chance. As long as it has a CHANCE of working well its fair, it doesnt have to be a 100% unresistable thing.<P>Also, many people dont use pets on raids cause they get feared and run off to drag a few more baddys to the group. Now, I certainly dont think they should be fear invulnarable, heck, maybe they dont even need any more fear resistance. What would help though is the ability to /pet get lost even when a pet is feared/charmed. <P>I hope these suggestions help my class to allow thier raid teams to better prosper.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

But from a sensical RPing point of view at least it is a good idea.<P>The undead are not afraid of what the living are. They are not afraid of death because:<P>1. Been there, done that.<P>2. Undeath is a curse, death is a gift next to it.<P>So from an RP perspective I think no Undead creature be it NPC pet PC pet or just plain MOB should be able to be feared with just normal fear spells.

</FONT><HR>powerbait, there you go again... <P>I'm also not a 50+, and from reading the majority of issues... and reading the feedback here...  seems like being a possible Band-aid as a Enchanter replacement isn't what most want.  Might be what you think is best... You don't have to insult someone again, I've read from other High lvl Necros... Don't see the cheap shots.  Experience in playing does not give you any Maturity or Tact...  <P>Most Necros I read here want to be able to continue delivering dmg, and be as efficient at 50+ as they were before...  I'm sure most don't want to add Crowd Control in addition to Mana Batterie.  <P>I thought that Necros were supposed to be Evil and Selfish in nature.  Their spells in the majority is to keep them alive, and make sure their pets keep them alive.  All your life you think other classes are Insignificant... but when you are near you're prime... you all of a sudden can't do so much on your own...  And you'll forget you're upbringing from 1-50... and start "Giving"....<P>In a "Video Game"... I'll give...  In an RPG...  This would leave a distaste to all Necros.  Why can't they join in a group, but Kick butt... or show their strenght...  They have to lower themselves into charging up other casters Mana...  Putting yourself into the mind of a Necro that built it's strenght all his life... how can he take this without going Insane....<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, i'd first like to THANK Absor or anyone else who has to read all of these posts.  I know i haven't read them all and do feal for anyone who does.  Second i'd like to say i know you guys are very busy but feedback from you Absor would help us out alot and would be very appreciated.  I know what we want (even if alot of it is unreasonable) but what do you find acceptable and what do you like and dislike about these ideas?<P>First i'd like to suggest that, before you make any major changes, you make fixes first.  Such as the graphic for ignite bones, grouping, maybe fixing the pathing in major uber levels, etc.  Then see if you should change something major like the HP to Mana line.<P>It seems the biggest concern you have with the line is that it's overpowering us.  Aren't we doing just fine as we are?  If it isn't hurting anything why "balance" it and end up hurting us?  Its not like we are getting a huge amount of extra mana by sucking life back that we lost.  Currently, with CoB, i can cast Vampiric Curse (which is the most mana effiecient) and get about 200 life back in 10 ticks (20 life per tick) while CoB takes about 16 life for 16 mana.  Vampiric curse costs 133 mana.  So after 10 ticks i've lost 160 health, gained 160 mana and gained back about 200 life.  Which means, after 10 ticks, i have 40 extra health and 27 extra mana.  I think thats a pretty small amount considering most of my fight last about 15 ticks when i solo.  Plus, when you get it, you have less than 700 hp and over 1000 mana.   <P>At higher levels our HP to Mana isn't even a 1:1 ratio.  Lich is 32 hp for 20 mana, i do believe. While Demi Lich is 48 for 31.  You run a greater risk of killing yourself in a fight than getting back good mana, especially if you don't get a life DoT on the MOB.  You use it mostly for down time...suck some life into mana and go Drain it back in next fight.  The mob isn't going down faster, the fight isn't a breeze (2 or so hits when you're so low on life you're dead), and its not unbalancing or unfair to any other class.  <P>What would happened if these did their original damage (which is twice the current i believe)?  Our down time would be worse with it than without it.  If CoB did the 2:1 ration i'd lose 32 life and gain 16 mana.  Almost 100 for Demi Lich...and only having 2000 life...20 ticks you're dead and that's if you aren't hit by that monster not to mention that we get stat penalties at 2 bubs.  Ouch!  it would cause us to completely redefine our solo tactics and maybe even group tactics and not for the better.  Less life equals less mana which equals more downtime...considering its doubled i'd bet the increase in downtime would increase amazingly.  Its hard to solo blues as it is with it in the current system, just think if you added this.  If any Necro says he'd rather have group spells than a half damage HP to Mana line than that person is either in-expierenced, confused, or just strange.  <P>We weren't ment to group and if any Necro doesn't like that than he should go play another class that was meant to group...like every single other one in the game.  Anything short of completely making us completely different isn't going to make us more desired for uber raids.  Even a 2:1 Direct mana give to another class doesn't meen its better than replacing that nec with just another one of the class he is mana dumping to.  Giving us group buffs like Group DMF is a great idea...and personaly i wouldn't mind replacing some of our Essence Emrald spells (that are impratical, period) with group buffs would be great.<P>Thank You            </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Remove the regen and damage shield to compensate for this. As it is now, regular HS is an upgrade to Quivering Veil since it can be cast day or night, making it much more versitle in its intended use.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"As with all the other threads, I want to talk about class balance here, not about bugs or epic weapons." -Absor<P>I will make this post direct, and to the point.<P>-The main issue, with Necromancer balance, is their (our) lack of an ability to make a useful contribution to a high level group. (I'll say this is post 46, but it could be earlier).<BR>Necormancers, from my understanding, just need a role to fufill.<P>-"Mana dumping" is not a sufficiently useful, or even fun ability, to justify bringing a Necromancer on a large raid specifically for this purpose. As Zrazzt said, 'Why not just bring another one of the classes that are going to be pumped?' <BR>**IF** "mana dumping" is the role that high level Necromancers have been given, then the ability must be useful enough, so that the raiding party or group does not simply just 'find another cleric to fill the spot'. Or, if "mana dumping" is only a portion of a Necromancers role, then their (our) other functions in a group must be made more useful or new abilities added. <P>-Suggestions for new Necromancer spells, that would increase their usefullness in large raids post 46.<BR>-A VERY brief targetable invulnerability (Harmshield), maybe 5-10 seconds with a recast time similar to harmshield. This could be used as a temporary, emergency measure to save a character, or for pulling large, "epic" monsters. This could get out of hand, potentially, but implimented correctly it would be very useful. Note: The casting time would have to be very low, as enchanters have something similar.<BR>-A high level targetable buff for melee classes, with a limited duration and a ressurection like effect after it fades. (Keep in mind, this is an idea, so its not very specific, but I'm really excited about it). The intention behind it would be to provide Necromancers with a spell that can stack on top of most current buffs, that would, last the duration of an "epic" fight, the fade with a downside. (This could take many forms, including, but not limited to: AC, ATK, HPS, resistances, immunity to dragon fear, or a combination of all of the above)<P>Keep in mind that neither or these suggestions is intended as a "quick fix", but I hope to spark a discussion on new ideas for Necromancer spells, as I'm sure there are some excellent ideas out there.<P>Sasthaz<BR>"ranger buffs are cute"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hello Folks and hello Absor,<P>I might not be an old necro, but reached lvl52 now and since lvl50 i start to begin like becoming a manamaker, corpse summoner and "send the pet as addition". Necros post 50 do NOT deal any significant damage at all in events or raids. All we can now do is send pet if allowed or transfer mana. Please tell me, do you think ANYONE playing a necro is satisfied with that condition ? I guess not at all )<P>Please, dont change anything from lvl1 to lvl50 its fine as it is !  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>My Idea about ressing:<BR>Necros are Masters of the Undead, and we have the convergence spell but we need an Essence Emerald (Soulgem). Now i have some better Idea )<P>Maybe make the spell nighttime only, every ress let the necro and the ressed person fall back to 1hp and let also the necro suffer from ressing effects. Maybe make the ress cost 1400 mana.<P>I am very unsatisfied that shadowknights got the Summon Corpse Spell at lvl50. You always tell us you want to support grouping, but than why would you put a SK in charge of a MAJOR Necromancer Role of a Raid ? Giving SK summon corpse ability makes the necro even more needless. (OK you could throug in the argument that lvl57 necros can conjure corpse with small coffins BUT HOW many 57+ necros are there on each server ? not many huh ? ) Please raise the SK summon corpse spell lvl to maybe 57 or even 60 OR move the new summon corpse spell for necros to lvl50 or maybe lvl53.<P>I wont talk much about the magepet fear issue because several players have given their opinion on it and i fully aggry that they shouldnt have the fear resists.<P>I also like to through in the Idea of giving necros more Undead illusions and dont allow Enchanter to have ANY Undead Illusions at all.<P>Sorry bout my bad english, i hope its better understandable than my gnomish  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">)<P>.--- Kemtar, 52 Heretic - Ayonae Ro ---.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056290-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056290-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056290-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056290-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056290-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056290&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056290&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
