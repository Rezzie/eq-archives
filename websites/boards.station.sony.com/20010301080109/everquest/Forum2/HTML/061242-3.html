</FONT><HR>What I find extremely disturbing is this whole attitude that an improvment to one class, *any* improvement, is somehow a "nerf" to every other class.  Druids and Shamans get better healing spells at highter levels, this is a cleric nerf.  Raising Ranger, Paladin, and SK skill caps is a nerf to warriors.  Hell, the Epic Quest weapons for every class, that clearly was a nerf to Paladins.<P>My frank and honest opinion is that all the changes they've put through over the last few months have been overwhelmingly positive.  They've addressed a lot of issues that have been neglected since the start of the game, and redressed a lot of assumptions that turned out to be drastically wrong (e.g. that Hybrids would be inherently better than pure classes.)  Yes, some class have gotten more improvement than others (a general opinion by me would be that the hybrids got the most out of things, but I'll be the first to admit that druids got some sweet improvements as well.)  But how does that detract from *your* gameplay?  Paladins can really, truly tank at higher levels, does this make your warrior useless?  You still have quite a lot more hitpoints and do quite a bit more damage.  A shaman or druid can heal better, does this make the Cleric superflous?  The Clerics are still hands-down the best and most efficient at healing, the new enhancements don't even threaten to make druids or shamans better than clerics in that area.  So is an improvement in Druid tracking a death blow to the rangers?  Does it affect a Cleric at all?<P>That being said, let me make it clear that I am wholeheartedly in favor of Rangers being much better trackers than anyone else.  But I look at it this way: making another class better at something doesn't make you any worse, particularly if you're still better than them at it.<P>Yes, I play a druid as my primary character.  Would I be happy with a higher track cap than 50?  Definitely.  I'd be ecstatic.  Do I think that Druids should have a higher cap than Bards?  Yes, probably.  Is it an insult to me as a druid that they don't on the live servers?  Absolutely not.  The fact that a Bard has a cap of 100 doesn't alter the usefulness of mine at 50.  Its a highly useful skill.<P>To everyone, I say this: show a little faith.  Maybe they have more ranger-only improvements in the works.  Maybe, in light that Rowl said the skill isn't linear, there are distinct "break points" in the skill level where the skill is drasticaly wider in range.  Perhaps a 200 isn't twice as good as a 100, maybe its ten times as good, you don't know.  Or maybe they just think that since Track has absolutley nothing to do with combat, improving another class at it slightly won't change the balance of the classes significantly. Or maybe the changes on Test won't go live at all, which would be a shame, but I won't lose any sleep over it.  Or perhaps the bard skill cap will be lowered, rather than the druid cap raised, which I also think would be a shame.<P>But at any rate, enough with the negative attitude toward other people's classes.  A positive change to another class will help you, in the end, this is a cooperative game.  Think about how a change will *really* effect things, and then take into account that you haven't actually seen the effect on the servers, live.  Then reserve judgement.  Wait and see.  Who knows, maybe your class will be the next to get an enhancement, and everyone else will be crying foul at you?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Most other windows can (I think inventory is the only one that cannot) be resized.  The patch message said that tracking is now full screen.

</FONT><HR>Oh wait!!  I can change the size and position in the eqclient.ini file.  But...  no offense,  it looks like crap.  It does not truly expand the list for number of creatures seen.  It has the same dimensions for the true tracking area, and the rest is overhang.

</FONT><HR>WOW, <P>  I see a lot of people flameing druids, flameing bards, and lets be honest flameing everyone!!!<BR>  Being a 54th druid&lt; tribunal server&gt; I do have a couple small things to say on the tracking subject.<BR>1&gt; please dont change tracking for druids, honestly I do use it a lot, but I do not feel that druids need an upgrade. If it works why change it ????<BR>2&gt; personally I dont care that bards have a higher tracking skill, they are a jack of all trades, they should have a good tracking skill, has anyone actually watched a bard kite anything ...it takes them a while to kill it but its a bautiful thing to watch someone with that sort of patience.<BR>3&gt; someone made a comment about druids track outside and bards inside only &lt;roflol&gt; have you ever tried tracking in a dungeon....try it sometimes ...its hularious!!<BR>4&gt; rangers are defined as 3/4 warrior and 1/4 druid. They get druids spells &lt;includeing heals,albeit a lot lower levels than druids&gt; but still it does help them out, as does a druids tracking.<BR>5&gt; Anyone who says that druids are greedy and mean people really need to make a druid and get him to the telport levels.....live in our shoes for a couple weeks and try not to kill anyone. I have been Anon since 39th level for the simple reason of I get at least 1 tell every 10 minutes by someone I dont know to take time out of my game time to take them somewere. You would be supprised at how many times I have been asked to take someone from LS to Commons instead of them just running through one zone. BTW im in seblis at the time of the tell. It gets pretty repititious after the first 10 to 100 tells in a saturday in fear or hate.<BR>6&gt; Personally i am glad they uped the healing for druids, on tribunal there are a lot of druids and not so many high level clerics, beleive me when your in kael pretty deep and a warrior who is almost dead needs a heal it feels good to be able to help and i havent seen one cleric I know ***** about a druid or a sham helping him out. In high level raids its a lot better have as many healers as possible &lt; Ive even seen rangers stop fighting to help heal a friend in danger&gt; the more that can heal the better.<BR>7&gt; quad kiteing &lt; never done it never will&gt; the only time you will see me pull more than one of anything is a: a mistake and uasally I shout out I made a mistake then either zone or egress out.<BR>B: pulling  the temple in fear with a couple rangers &lt; had 10 at one time ...I was scared to death&gt;<BR>8.&gt; Finally to all those people who think that druids are UBER and only want the PHAT LEWT...Ihave 1500pp in the bank, my equitment is good and relaible, but definatly not UBER, my AC is a 701 &lt; with SLN&gt; and my HP is a 1382 &lt;with SLN&gt; ....anyone who has fought in any hihg level dungeon knows ....the druid dies QUIK... <BR>9&gt; If druids are so selfish why the hell did I CR over 20 corpses from Vox at 51st level ....lost almost 3 levels in 10 minutes...some will say im stupid for that .....maybe I am but I will do anything for my friends <P>Just my 2cps<P>Bdan Rex <BR>Regulators of Norrath<BR>Tribunal Server <BR>54th Druid <BR>The Bulldog of RNG<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Bards have every skill (save a few) but suck at all of them EXCEPT for tracking. Oh but you say we have our "mana free" songs. Our songs that can only be sang 3 at a time? Our songs that have the power decreased to compensate for not using mana? <P>I find it extremely funny that druids (not all of you) think this is one more thing they should have bumped up. Rangers by far should have the best tracking. This does not include just distance, but also ease of use.<P>I've fought to defend the druids of late. They get flamed for the enhancements they get, they get flamed for their ability to solo, they get harrassed for their SOWs and ports. But then they see that bards can maybe track a little better than them and then start coming up with some RP crap about bards drinking too much to track? I can't believe you people. Do you honestly need to have everything? <P>You are great soloers, you bring tons to a group all the way up to 50 and now even beyond, stop trying to grab up every little thing you can. I even saw a post saying rangers should only track better than druids based on the fact that archery isn't going to be improved soon.<P>Let the Rangers track better than anyone, and maybe let the bards have something they are not totally sucky at.

</FONT><HR>The difference between the increase in combat skill caps relative to warriors and the increase in Tracking skill caps relative to Rangers is VERY real.  Hybrids have ALWAYS had skill caps close to Warriors.  Alot of the Warriors complaining about the skill cap changes have been lowbies and this honestly blows my mind.  You know why?  Warriors and Hybrids through all of the levels up to 50 have similar skill caps.  They have the exact same skill caps up to level 39 with regards to weapons skill, offense, and defense yet somehow they are offended that we want to continue to have the same sort of relationship with regard to skill caps post 50 and we're still getting the shaft there for the most part since we're only good at one side and still suck at the other.<P>With Tracking it has ALWAYS been a seperate story.  Rangers are the ONLY class that starts with Tracking.  They are hunters and outdoorsmen.  Druids are most definately neither.  They are wilderness priests and this is a pretty significant distinction.  As a result, Druids do not even get Tracking until level 20.  Bards get their skill last but learn it fairly well as a result of their mastery of many skills.<P>NONE of these classes is comparable to Rangers in Tracking EVER!  This isn't looking at Rangers and Warriors with a 10 points skill differential between Offense and Defense at level 50.  This is the best non-Ranger Tracker being 100 points behind Rangers where Tracking is concerned.<P>Tracking is our role in the outdoors.  It was pathetically screwed up by a horrible user interface for the skill and for the past two years Druids have been better than us at Tracking.  Unless you're talking about using the skill for nothing except rare spawn detection Tracking (200) was utterly useless.<P>Want to have some fun?  Using the old user interface try to find the Ghoul Messenger in South Karana when he's already up and not just spawning (since I know that some like to point out that you can do all kinds of spawn hunting with the old tracking...  assuming of course that you're camping spawn points and movement paths, of course).  The Short Sword of Morin quest was designed by Brian Hook as an actual quest to make use of our Tracking skill.  We should never have needed to know where it spawned or where it moved or hoped to run into it in order to complete this quest but when I was in my mid-20s and trying this quest that's exactly what I needed because Tracking was insufficient for actually finding something that we were looking for.<P>Druids did not have this problem and it was a slap in the face to us.  I pulled in Trakanon's Teeth shortly after release and before pathing was made public knowledge.  It was completely humiliating to have to ever call in a Druid or a Bard to find the first spawn so that I could do my job.<P>No, Druids had enough of a Tracking edge that they weren't supposed to have for too long.  There is no justification for letting them have better Tracking when Rangers had to put up for 2 years with Tracking that was not worth having at skill 200.  It is insulting to me and to the intelligence of every Ranger who plays this game that Absor would say something so blatantly false as having high Tracking was good prior to the changes.<P>Druids are not Trackers, they should not have a higher skill than they currently do.<P>Terrak Steeltalon<BR>Level 56 Outrider<BR>Bertoxxulous</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

With my Bard that was not really possible at all, because he picked up so many more mobs.<P>Without changing the default sort to distance, increasing the skill, and therefore the range, for druids could be worse than leaving it where it is.  <P>A little more range would be nice though.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>First of all, I think the problem is that FUNCTIONALLY, Druid Tracking skills (with a raised Tracking cap) will be as useful as Ranger Tracking skills at everything but trying to see if named spawns pop in a zone.  If the Ranger skill cap was at 500, and the Druid skill cap was at 200, then WOW!! That would be a range difference of over 300!!  The trouble is, it won't matter how big the difference is if the Druids' much lower Tracking works great for most situations.  You can just get the Druid to do it for you because functionally, they are plenty good for the job...even if the numbers aren't as high as those of a Ranger.<P>Additionally:<BR>1. I think Druids have enough bonuses at both soloing and grouping that they don't really need this one (and it doesn't seem like they asked for it).  50 Tracking, I sorta don't mind.  Sorta...<BR>-----------<BR>2. Indoor tracking is pretty crappy except for checking to see if something named has popped in the dungeon.  For me, it's almost a non-issue.<BR>-----------<BR>3.  Rowyl saying tracking isn't linear may be either very good, or very bad for Rangers (he didn't bother to say 'how' it isn't linear so we could be the judge) and I don't necessarily see a reason to give (even polite, considerate or, knowledgeable) game designers some special benefit of the doubt.  If Verant made the blanket statement, "We are going to change your monthly fee", should I just be quiet and assume any changes must certainly be to my benefit?  No, I shouldn't assume a vague statement about billing me would be to my benefit.  Why should I assume a vague statement about tracking is to my benefit?  <P><BR>Secondly, since this seems to be becoming a forum for druids falling all over themselves telling you how they don't do any of the stuff all those "bad Druids" do, here's my 2cents on that subject.  Before you start any flames, I'm not asking for a Druid nerf (just a halt in their power escalation as regards to tracking).  <BR>{DISCLAIMER-------------I'm only commenting on issues that Druids themselves first brought up here--I would have never done it otherwise.  Yes, I have friends/guildmates that are druids.  Yes, I know how to group and have actually made friends in-game.  No, I'm not a troll and I'm not asking for a Druid nerf.}<BR>--------------<BR>I guess I now know that not all Druids out there quad-kite.  Unfortunately a sufficient number of Druids quad-kite that most of us have seen it frequently.  I don't think this truly annoying tactic needs any enhancement via Tracking skill increases.  If creatures get 'stolen' from people when they do this, it's hard to be sympathetic--chances are a couple of people kiting like this are running around with every creature that's anywhere nearby.<BR>----------------<BR>I'm sure some Druids (and for that mater Wizards) will Teleport for free.  I've seen Wizzys do it on rare occasions, but have never seen a Druid do it.  I've even had Wizards offer to TP me for free when I asked them, but once again, never a Druid.  I completely understand not wanting to be bothered with it constantly and wouldn't blame you if you didn't do it for free 99.99999999999% of the time, but I have NEVER seen a Druid offer a TP free to anyone except friends and guildmates.  Maybe I've just missed a lot of those shouts in my (nearly) 2 years of casual observation.  Maybe Xegony is just less friendly, I dunno.  On a positive note, Druids are usually very free with giving out buffs like SoW, Lev, etc--kudos to you guys for that.  On a less positive note, I'm not sure if it's a good idea to threaten people on this board by telling them that if they both complain about Druids and post their in-game names here that Druids won't buff/TP them in-game because their characters will somehow be "marked" as being anti-Druid.<BR>--------------<BR>Maybe you don't see many Clerics around because Druid healing is mostly sufficient? Maybe the game, as it is, doesn't really need many Clerics for your standard, everyday, non-raid situation?  Recent boosts in healing aggro and Druid/Shaman healing should affect this too, I'll bet.  According to the most recent (ongoing) Stratics survey; 13.7% of people have a primary that's a Druid...only slightly lower than the number of people who play both Clerics (8.3%) and Shaman (6.6%) combined.  Those numbers have to be saying something about the healing classes and their relationships to one another.<BR>-----------------<BR>I'm sure not all Druids are Loot-Farmers, but from what I've seen (and heard from others) a disproportionately large number of Loot-Farmers are Druids.  Certainly more than 13.7% of Farmers are Druids.  The same may be true (but to a lesser extent in the last year) for Necros.  At least nobody is considering an improvement to tracking for Necros, thank heavens.<P><BR>Rhen StarTreader -- Ranger<BR>Pingo Omnipotent -- Necromancer<BR>both on Xegony.........</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Please keep track the way it is currently.  Druids don't need an upgrade because they're useful enough with ports, DDs, DOTs, etc.  With the scroll bars, any increase, especially one above the Bards tracking max, would be detrimental to Rangers.  The current track setup is fine.

SoW (3 classes) Snare (2+3 classes) dmg shields (3+2 classes) teleport (2 classes).<P>As for Absors history of druid v. bard tracking he is absolutely correct.<P>Bards were originally given to high a skill by mistake. When druids were offered a raise to the same or just above on this very message board Bard we declined due to the old way skill v. usefulness worked.

</FONT><HR>There is a "riot" because it is unfair that JUST as Rangers FINALLY get to be the best at their class-defining skill, there's a move planned to erode their advantage.<P>You originally weren't even supposed to get the scrollbar.  That scrollbar alone neutralizes the disadvantages to high skill.  The filters are only a convenience.<P>Because everyone got the scrollbar, Tracking is not really a scalable skill.  IE, 200 Tracking is not twice as good as 100 Tracking.  If you have Tracking at all you will probably be able to find what you want; adding more range doesn't improve your performance nearly as much as adding the skill in the first place did.<P>So yes, Rangers are getting defensive.  It's bad enough that two other classes have the ability at all.  It's bad enough that Bards have it at such a high level.  Tracking is supposed to be the one area where Rangers truly excel and that's not really true as things stand.  It absolutely will not be true if Druids are given an upgrade.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First point the thing about stuff just being on test is not valid. We get the tracking improvements and i'm a very happy ranger; i'm talking to a lvl 21 druid and he says 'o my tracking just went to 103' - pops the happy balloon straight off. The thing about tracking is that it is the number 1 thing for a lot of rangers, i personally would swap dual wield, all DD and DOT spells, SoW etc for rangers to be the proper and undisputed masters of tracking.<P>The difference in skill level doesn't necessarily matter. If druids are 150 then making rangers 250 is not gonna help i don't think. There are 3 things u want tracking for: <P>1) When a rare spawn has popped<BR>2) What is nearby in my hunting level for chasing or pulling.<BR>3) Is there anything very nasty nearby that i should be running away from. <P>Most of the time u are going to be more interested in 2 and 3. There will be an optimum range for this - this range will be less than or around 150 (my guess based on my current skill level). This means that rangers will not be any better at the skill than druids and maybe bards except for looking for rare spawns. And even then a sowed invis druid could easily make up for difference in range by running around.<P>Second point there seems to be a lot of criticism of druids generally some of which i think is unfair. Most people will play a class that they like for all sorts of personal reasons. Some people will play a class purely for what they see as 'game advantage' reasons. This second type of person would tend to accumulate around the class(es) they thought had an advantage. If by an amazing coincidence this second type of player was less 'nice' than the other type of player - then the class(es) they chose would eventually get a bad name.<P>Thirdly, every one of these threads i've read so far gets spoiled by some troll (often the same ones) starting a flame war by throwing out inflammatory comments. I think all the sane ppl should just ignore anything that is obviously antagonistic - don't try and argue, debate or anything just /ignore.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Druids are priests, but they are not the travelers that bards are, they are one with nature, but bards are travelers, they understand routes thru things, they understand how to get places, and they understand how people move.  Bards spend alot more time going between the places so it makes sense that they can follow things through them.<P>I think the default ordering should be changed to distance tho, truthfully I wish my range wasnt so good, I almost never use track because accept for named spawns I just want to find the nearest mob to me that can give xp.

</FONT><HR>I am utterly amazed that this is raising so much contreversy.  I'm shocked that its still on the first page, frankly.  I never realized people felt so strongly about tracking.  Would Rangers really be willing to trade SoW, Dual Weild, and so on for mastery of tracking?  I really doubt most players feel that way.  Heck, if I was a ranger, I wouldn't feel that way.<P>Once again, I'm asking everyone to take a step back, take a deep breath, and consider how much this, or any change for that matter, really affects things.  Does it affect your combat ability?  Does it affect your pulling ability?  Does it affect how willing people will be to group with you?  Heck, does it affect you at all?<P>Probably not, even if you are a Bard, who are somehow getting the "short end of the stick" from this change.  I really don't understand that attitude.  How does making Druids better make Bards worse?  Should I complain when Rangers get more Druid spells?  Should I kick and scream every time Clerics get a new heal?  I play a Rogue, maybe I should protest the "Jolt" spell?  That's treading on Evade's territory, isn't it?<P>And what about this attitude, and I've seen it before, that a certain class has it moderetely easy up to a certain point, so it should be much harder after that to "balance it out."  The Druid tracking cap has been capped pretty low, and until they implemented the scroll bar, that's been an actual advantage.  Since the Druids have enjoyed that advantage up until now, they don't deserve to reap the benefits that the scroll bar gives?  What about a new druid?  Since he never experienced this advantage, he shouldn't have to "pay" for the disadvantage.  Anyone else see where I'm going here?<P>At any rate, they will do what they will do.  If anyone wants my opinion, I'd say that bringing Druid tracking on par with Bards seems fair, but any higher seems out of place unless they also bring up Ranger's.  OTOH, I'll be dissapointed, but hardly infuriated, if they leave things as is.  Facing facts, higher tracking for Druids would be nice, but in the long run it won't make a huge difference.<P>Oh, and one last comment, don't assume you have the same view of a particular class as Verant does, as far as "in game" goes.  Many of these classes can be interpereted many different ways.  And I've gotten the distinct impression thing that "make sense" for a class go out the window when game balance is threatened anyway.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Someone said that it was understandable for Druids to have better track as druid being a parent class they taught rangers to track, as it were...<P>Hmm...  Yes I can see druids teaching rangers to cast spells.<P>But what were rangers doing whilst the druids spent all that time learning those spells?<BR>Well I'd guess learning to track.<BR>IMHO it would be rangers that would teach druids to track, not the other way around.<P>Rangers NEED a class defining feature, it is NOT tracking (apprently), it is NOT archery (it is *really* so not archery  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ).  What is it?<P>I think the reason everyone gets at druids is that they are good at everything (maybe not great, but good) and never seem to lose anything only gain things.  <BR>Yes in the end game maybe they aren't so powerful (and I mean powerful in the sense that a druid can do pretty much what he/she wants. Not in the sense of being the most powerful nuker or doter or whatever), but after 50 odd levels you really would expect balance to come into effect eventually.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Kione, it affects me because when my advantages are given to other classes, they are devalued.<P>The ability to locate choice targets is a selling point for Rangers looking for groups.  If Druid ability in this area is increased, our ability to leverage our Tracking for group spots is diminished.<P>Rangers are supposed to be the best trackers in the game.  If Druids have their skill increased, particularly as much as the current plan calls for, that will not be true in any meaningful sense.  Druids will be able to track nearly as well as Rangers, and effectively just as well when you consider that targets at the bottom of the range list are almost certainly engaged before you can get to them anyway.<P>We were told that 'going forward' (yecch I hate marketroid phrases), Tracking improvements would be limited to Rangers.  Well, that wasn't exactly true, was it now.  Everyone got the scrollbar -- which was specifically described as a Ranger-only improvement -- and now Druids are getting a huge skill increase.  After two years of suffering being the third best of three classes with what is supposed to be our specialty skill we are finally elevated to our rightful place, and no sooner does this happen then it is stripped from us again.<P>This is the second time in recent history that Rangers have gotten something good only to have it snatched away again, the last time being Trueshot.  (When Trueshot was fixed -- the first time -- it did a respectable amount of damage and a 55 Ranger could finally get an invite to a raid...for about a week.  Now Trueshot barely has any effect at all.)  So yeah, we're getting a little bitter.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061242-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061242.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061242-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=061242&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=061242&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
