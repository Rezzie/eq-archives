Stackable, and the thread sells for about 1p each, or 20p a stack.<BR>You might hold off selling these until your skill gets up into the high teens or 20's.  At this point, you can start combining the thread with a LQ cat, wolf, or bear pelt, to make leather padding.  Leather padding typically sells for 4p each, 80p for a stack.<P>All of this came about due to the addition of Fine Plate to the game.  With the money earned from it, my 12th level Paladin is about as nicely equipped as my 19th level Warrior...the warrior actually had to play catchup recently, and was only able to do so by farming some silks and pelts!<P>Prices vary by server...I'm on Luclin.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Bat Wings in GF.  I have a 4th level High Elf Enchanter with 35pp, untwinked, just from selling bat wings.  The key is collect several stacks before you sell by "playing the market", but you have to have money to make money.  Sell your first one or two stacks first - try to  hold out for 3pp - you should find a buyer if you are patient.  Then once you have that 6pp keep collecting bat wings, but also buy from everyone who is selling for 1 or 2pp.  Buy a backpack and keep hunting and buying batwings until you can fill it (I think I collected 3 stacks myself and bought 5), then send out the following /auc:<P>/auc Selling Backpack of Bat Wings - 35pp, will deliver!  That's seven fewer newbies you have to deal with!!!<P>I had 3 people try to buy it from me immediately and got a lot more laughs, plus I sold the stacks for ~ 4p 3g a stack!<P>I guarentee it will work every time, just be patient and don't sell your individual stacks!<P>Ironcast, 4th level Enchanter of Drinal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Okay.  Clearly the easiest way to make money at low levels is to play an evil Erudite.  Paineel is such a sickeningly good newbie zone I can't understand why no one is ever there.  My Eru SK had a full suit of leather armour at level 3.<P>However, if you INSIST on being a Wood Elf Ranger or some other such thing, the best way I know to make money is to start selling loot.  Everyone has that bit right.  However, as soon as you have 30-50pp to rub together you can stop hunting entirely and just sit in EC trading.  If you buy low and sell high (and the bigger the purchanse the greater the profit) you can make thousands of plat in a few days with no personal risk unless someone trains to the tunnel.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm going to second the leather padding idea with a little more detail.  This is something you can do at fairly low levels with very little investment if you're willing to put in the time.  All you need is a sewing kit (couple gp?) a skinning knife - (never had a problem finding a smith to make me one if I got the ingredients myself - less than 2 plat - maybe a lot less) and a few patterns (very cheap) The patterns are used to make patchwork from all the ruined pelts you find, which will make a set of armor initially for you but more importantly will get your tailoring skill up. <P>You can kill all the necessary ingredients yourself by the time you're level 5 - spiderlings and wolves - even the occasional black bear.  I made and sold my first stack for 100 p before I was level 6 and 2 more before I was 7.  That's a lot of money for a 7th level character.  I've never had a problem finding buyers - all in all I've made and sold 9 stacks - 8 to the same buyer and I can't keep up with his demand.  I've probably put 300 back into buying threads and pelts - the rest is profit, and of course I could have just kept getting all the ingredients myself and never invested anything in it at all. <P>Anyway - just my 2 cents - I'm a big proponent of padding as the most accessible way for a relative newbie to make relatively large amounts of cash.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>People seem to be quick at overlooking newbie quests.  You know, this is what this game is all about.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Some quests aren't worth it, I agree.  But some are quite interesting.  I don't have a lot of experience, so the best one I know is in Ak'Anon.  Go talk to the guy standing just outside the Library, he'll send you to another little guy in an observatory just outside the city's walls.  That guy will give you a box to fill with Infected Rat Livers: each box is worth half a bub of exp at level 3, and a quarter a bub at level 4.  Plus, you'll get some gold and cloth gloves you can sell back.  I know, I know, you can't make a living with it, but that way you can make the most out of your regular trips to town.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Also, if you don't mind your Ring of Scale faction, you can plan some good mailing itinearies when you are shopping around.<P>Minerios, proud Half-Elf Ranger on the 2nd track</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Everyone is a big fan of selling bone chips.  But if you are of small size and in Faydewer, I say your best bet is to turn them into the guy in the Dwarf Paladin Guild (South Kaladim).<P>Faction, exp, and patchwork armor for a stack of four chips.  Not bad if you aren't a twink.<P>I've seen a zillion wood elves run around at 5th level without armor.  There is absolutely no reason for this.  If you sell your chips to a necro/SK you will get 1-3pp a stack.  Enough for one peice of leather.  That's not worth passing up on 5 pieces of patchwork in my opinion.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ansbach: I can improve your bat wing money making scheme one step more.  Theres a merchant in Freeport that sells them for mere silver.  If you are as successful as you say at selling wings, this will help you clean up with only 1 hour wasted on the 2 boat trips.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>As for the alltime best moneymaking: bear bashing in Everfrost.  Get 1 HQ pelt a day, worth 30pp on my server.  Plus while you are doing this, you can pick up the stuff for Halas newbie quests.<P>Don't forget to scavenge the shops, either.  Bone chips sell for 5pp a stack?  No problem.  Given 20 minutes, you could probably get a couple stacks out of felwithe or Kelethin.  In Halas, I found a motherload of Ice Goblin Necklaces.  Buy them for about 1 silver each, turn in 6 of them for 2-6 gold plus faction and XP.  I earned almost a plat in level 1, and at level 2, found a TON of these in shops.  Next thing I know, I'm level 5.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Also, another good way to make money.  Save your 30pp you got from that first HQ bear skin.  Pop over to everfrost and offer banking to the IG campers.  You can get about 20% profit this way, and Fine Steel items.<P><BR>Oh, and let me emphasise, check shops often!  Usually hidden wealth in there.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Collecting silk from the large spider turned out to be very good and I combined them as I collected them. At vender rates I have over a plat worth in 30 minutes. I collected spiderling silk when no large spiders were around. I combined them to make string since I could stack them, but this wasn't worth much. I think if I later combine them with something it will be worth it.

</FONT><HR>Combine your two spiderling webs to make a thread. Then you can take three threads to make a cord. This gets combined with a pelt (ruined if I remember right) to make a leather padding. Or combine with a LQ pelt to make a bag of some sort- bigger the pelt, the bigger the bag.

</FONT><HR>While I've done extremely well on leather padding as well, I'd issue one caution: for reasons I haven't been able to figure out, the market seems to have completely dried up on Drinal. I used to be able to collect a stack of leather padding and sell it without much effort in the FP market for 100pp. <P>A few weeks ago, some guy was selling a stack for 50pp. I chuckled and bought it, then immediately started trying to sell it in FP market. I still have that stack of leather padding. Almost noone ever even expresses interest, and I haven't received one serious offer. I had someone offer me 10pp for it. Don't know why, but it is really annoying...<P>That being said, the economy on the whole on Drinal seems stagnant right now. Shortly after buying the stack of leather padding, I chuckled as I bought a Drolvarg Mantle for 25pp. After not getting any offer over 40pp for it weeks later, I finally traded it last night for a Golden Black Pearl Choker. Figured at least I might use that...<BR>I couldn't wear the Drolvarg Mantle...<P>Dave, speaking for Zsa Zsa<BR>20th Level Paladin and Keeper of the Funk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I believe he was going to LS, as he was not killing guards. Anyway, he /ooc'ed for a stack of food and drink. I told him I would go get it (having been a necro in EF I have had to do this). When I gave him the food and drink, he gave me like 18 gp, 100+ sp, and some rusty weapons. When he realized I was a cleric, he told me that there is a 34 necro/39 cleric Fear spell he can't get in Cab. I said I would go get it but could not afford it. He handed me 50 pp for the spell. I found it and it was just under 20. When I got back I tried to give him his change and he said "no keep it", so just looking out for high lvl folks who can't bank or shop can sometimes really pay off.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well one thing I know is that you'll need the "large sewing kit" to do that. I know where you can get one for 10pp and they deliver!<P>The easiest money maker I have found so far is getting the silk from the large spider and combining 2 in the small sewing kit. You get silk swatches from that and 3 of those will get you 1pp even at the vendor rate.<BR>Combining the spiderling's silk get you string first, then you combine 3 stings to get something more valuable, but that requires the large sewing kit.<P>Hank.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Neflyte - I think 100 pp a stack is probably close to an 'average' price.  - I've heard people say 80 on their servers - I sell for 100 but have sold one for 150, and have heard of people offering 200 when they're desperate.<P>The stack thing is very important if you're going to make leather paddings.  The first one is a hassle, but it's the way your buyers are going to want it, and they'll take you much more seriously as a future supplier if you can make a whole stack at once.<P>Also - go to where the smiths hang out to auction it - in Freeport area, that's North Freeport.  That's where I've sold all of mine.<P>And, I would advise getting a stack of patterns and getting your skill in tailoring up into the mid-20s by making patchwork from ruined pelts before you start making pads.  If you've spent a few hours hunting spiderlings and wolves and bears and stuff and then have it all disappear with failures, that really hurts.<P>Lastly - you can do all this with a small sewing kit - you don't need the large for paddings.<P>Good luck.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>High level characters usually have tons of money, so they are the best source for money. Of course begging won't get you anywhere, running errands is much better.<P>- "ATM" means giving somebody platinum for his gold pieces at a favorable rate, for example 10 PP for 130 gold. Of course you need some starting capital for that.<P>- Once you have an idea of the geography of Norrath, you can look out for people who are far from the next point where they can buy/sell. A good deal is to offer to run to the vendor and sell the loot for the KOS player for 20% of the profits. My best profit was in OoT where I sold one stack of food and one stack of drink for the fantastic sum of 1256 gold (but that was with my level 20 druid).<P>- Another possibility once you know your way around (or don't mind occasional deaths) is to go to places where high level players kill mobs but don't bother to loot heavy stuff. Bronze Axes in Butcherblock for example or the things close to Permafrost in Everfrost. Be polite and ask whether they don't mind if you loot the stuff, but usually thats okay with them. After one afternoon of collecting Bronze Axes in Butcher my dwarven warrior had more than 50 PP!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>If one is daring(having a bit of speed from SoW to run is useful here,should you get ambushed),the South Ro desert is often littered with unlooted corpses-the results of a guild whacking everything in sight to get the Ancient Cyclops(a giant-sized beastie that you DO NOT attack if you see,lest you get whomped on). As long as one is careful in avoiding the things the cyclops hunters miss,you can pick up quite a bit of rawhide and bronze loot here. They sell for near a platinum to a few platinum each piece-dark races can sell to the merchants smack dab in the middle of the sandy area and jump right back into looting the dead. :P<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum10/HTML/003817-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum10/HTML/003817-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum10&number=10&thisthread=003817&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum10&number=10&thisthread=003817&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
