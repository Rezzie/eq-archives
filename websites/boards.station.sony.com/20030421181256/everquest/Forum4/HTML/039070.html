Actually, I think most people hate it, but aren't willing to admit it.  My composition professor has a pretty interesting class.  A lot of the topics we deal with in there are pretty controversial too.  Luckily, I live in a backwards part of the US (in WV) and there's not much political correctness here.  I can't even imagine being bombarded with it in some parts of the country (let alone world).  One of the most annoying politically correct things that bothers me is bad language.  My composition professor has only one rule about bad language in his class and I think it should be followed by most people:  "Bad language is language that puts people down."  By that he means, say what you want but don't make what you say harmful to others.  I just wish people in this world would lighten up.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">Yeah come to think of it.

I am 42 years old on earth and I don't miss the "good old days".<P>When I was a little girl in Georgia (1964-1967 roughly), it was still legal for private clubs/places to discriminate based on color.  So when you went to Calloway Gardens there was a sign on the post that said "Colored Day was Thursday".<P>When and where I went to grade school (several states, dad was in the Army), girls were not allowed to wear pants at school and would be sent home.  Did not matter if there was a foot of snow on the ground.<P>When I was in 7th grade it was before Title 9 passed and I could not take Shop because I was born with the wrong genitalia.  Didn't matter that my mother taught Home Ec in the same District and I could have taught the course, nope, I had to take home ec with the other girls.  Later in high school I did take Auto shop, one of 3 girls in the class, out of 10 girls in the entire school who took it that year.<P>Yes, I was date-raped in college back when it was something you did nothing about.<P>Yes, I was sexually harassed at work when there was no recourse except to give in or quit.  I quit.<P>Yes, I have heard honest, well-meaning people discuss potential job candidates and chose a less qualified white male and give them more money for any number of reasons.<P>Yes, I cringe when I hear people use negative religious, sexual, racist, religious remarks about other people (even though I am a blue-eyed formerly blonde child).<P>I don't miss the old days.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I hate offending people, but I don't go entirely out of my way to avoid it.  I just use the words I'm used to using, which aren't offensive the most people except those that try to be treated differently.  For example, I do use the term mentally retarded.  If the person wants to be called something different, so be it and I will call them that.  I use the term black.  If that person wants to be called African-American, that's what I'll call them.  However, I feel the term black is more encompassing as not all black people are American.  Perhaps someone from the UK or some other country can tell me what term they use, but I have the feeling a black person from the UK isn't going to be called African-Britain.<P>I'm fat.  I'm not overweight.  I'm not husky.  I'm FAT!  I could care less if someone goes out of their way to avoid hurting my feelings.<P>I'm anti-PC.  But, I'm 110% against the things Iceblossom mentioned.

By calling them words that would be filtered here and treating them like less than the WASP Male Ideal?<P>When you demean a person by calling them a name (and I think you would include that in your PC label), it lessens both you and to a lesser extent them as well as society as a whole.  <P>When I am less of a person because I am a female, that is a problem to me.  When someone else is less of a person because of their religion, or nationality, or ethnic background, or skin tone, or sexual preference, the accidents they may have had or the circumstances they were born with, etc. etc. etc., it all concerns me.<P>And that is all, as you would say, PC.<P>There is no justification in calling names.  Not once you are over 6.<P>Another true story, a friend of mine was a cheerleader in high school.  Their team was on a road trip that took them through northern Idaho.  They stopped at a convenience store and the clerk said "I smell rice" and refused to serve another cheerleader who happened to be of Asian descent. <P>This was about 25 years ago... was that the good old days?

This same president will take some of our most crucial nuclear weapons secrets and sell them to a Communist county with the power to destroy us.<P>Liberals will elect a drunken Senator from Boston, who murdered a young women and has a liver the size of Texas. <P>They will elect a Senator from land-locked West Virgina, and that Senator will abuse his power on the Senate Appropriations Committee and build a 2.4 billion dollar naval base. <P>They will elect a liberal woman who tried to  impose socialized medicine, but then move to New York (where she missed her first vote) and say "i've been a citizen most of my life".<P>Mr. Jefferson, in the future, liberals will Liberals will demand that "Under God" be taken out of the pledge of alligence.<P>Mr. Jefferson, in the future, liberals will create a lawyer nation of no personal responsibility, where a woman will spill hot coffee on her lap and then sue the company for making it too hot. Later, a fat man will sue the same company because their food made him fat, not his overindulgence.<P>"This is not YOUR country, it is OUR country, yours, mine,"<P>No. It is mine. It is what I make of it.<P>"I have every single right that you do, as does everyone else who bares the right and responsibility to vote as he or she SEES FIT."<P>If you want to vote for communists, socialist ideals, that are against the very nature of what this country stand for, then you sir, are a traitor. This is NOT a socialist nation. This country was created for two reasons: Religious freedom and freedom from an oppressive government. <P>"How dare you presuppose that YOU hold the ultimate authority on anything?"<P>Ahh, big words, small mind. Where did I say that? Me? I want to be proud, strong country. You just want us to curl up and die. Your party is still so bitter over the loss in Florida, you're busting--and you'll do ANY thing as long as it's converse to what the President wants.<P>"I could equally say that a party that promotes the wholesale slaughter of innocent people"<P>Forgetting that you probably cut 'n paste that line right out of your "How to be a liberal" handbook, know that socialism is responsible for more deaths than any other government.<BR>Russia: 10 million+<BR>China: 20 million+<BR>Nazi Germany: millions and millions, who knows?<P>"who proports to promote democracy but at the same time refuses to accept the democratic process in other nations that yields outcomes that they dont want (see turkey about...2 weeks ago)."<P>The United States is a republic, not a democracy. There is a difference, albeit a minor one. You probably went to an "underfunded" public school though, eh? So I guess it's not your fault, as nothing is with liberals.<P>"That places within its highest ranks of power men who expose words of hatred and bigomy"<P>Senator Robert Byrd was a registered member of the KKK as recent as 1996. He is the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and basically decides what money gets spent where. Strom Thuman was a registered member of the KKK as well.<P>"who have covered up information regarding a LACK of terroist connections to nations soley because they want to bomb them"<P>Ah, yes, this "lack of connections". So few connections that the media and left wing liberals have been able to do nothing more than get the children of tree hugging baby boomers to go protest. All lies. That's typical from your side tho.<P>"that when faced with two nations they mount a campaigh against the LESSER of two threats, in order to inact some personal vendetta"<P>As most ignorant liberals do, you're lumping these two scenarios together falsely. Saddam was given a list of things to do 12 years ago as a condition of his surrender, and did none of them. That "vendetta" thing has got to be the most moronic arguement of all time.<P>"a party that has tried everything within its power to overturn the RIGHTS of its citizens"<P>Oh, you mean like the right to kill children? Or the right to a fair election? Or the right to have a president that doesn't lie to a Federal Grand Jury, commit perjury (both felonies)? The right to choose which doctor he/shes? The right to work 4 months out the year for Uncle Sam? The right to act like France and curl up and die?<P>"he party that turned our first budget SURPLUS into a crippled economy,"<P>Wow, imagine that! Another liberal that never took an economics class. Aye, it had nothing to do with the fact that this fickle nation, as a whole, got bored with the internet/computer fad. Yep, in a matter of 2 months one single person destroyed the economy of the most powerful country on earth, while answering to a liberal held congress and senate? Baaa baa sheep. what's next from your socialist handbook?<P>"a party who appoints an attorney general against the vehement and vocal opposition of MILLIONS"<P>And to the support of even more.<P>"one that promotes racial discrimiation in its police forces"<P>This is a new one. Are you talking about racial profiling? Oh, forget the fact that 70% of the criminals in our country's prisons are minorities, that's just a conicindence.<P>"a party that led this nation into a prolongued military conflict culminating in the worst DEFEAT in its history."<P>No, that defeat has yet to come. Under your American, we'll just sell nuclear secrets to the Chinese for campaign contributions. Then we'll wait for South Korea, Bin Laden and Saddam to arm themselves to the teeth, and then we'll be recovering from a nuclear winter.<P>"I support your RIGHT to vote for whomever you please"<P>I support your right to vote, but every time you pull that democrat handle, you're pounding one more nail into that coffin.<P>"I support your RIGHT to vote for whomever you please, how DARE you even suggest that the choices I make, or that any other citizen makes, in exercising his absolute and gaurenteed RIGHT to help form OUR government."<P>You kinda trailed off here--didn't finish your statement or thought. But that's typical from a liberal, so I'm not suprised.<P>"Let me put it another way, if in 2004 51% of this nation voted socialists into every single political office"<P>The day that happens is the day the United States of America dies.<P>When you get done reading chapter two of your "How to be a traitorous, anti-American liberal" handbook, let me know.<P>You will never win. <P>Ever.<P>"Can you define the word 'is'"? -President Bill Clinton.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

That is unamerican.<P>Jefferson, Washington, Lincoln, Adams, Franklin were all liberals. They wanted free expression and equal rights, you are trying to supress expression and take away the rights of those that you deem to be 'traitorous' just because they have a differing opinion. <P>How are enviromentalists the enemy? What are we going to do when everything is either dead or so poluted we can't use it.<P>Jefferson wouldn't know what the pledge of alligience is. He was long dead before that came about. At least learn the history of your country before making many ill-informed remarks. 'Under god' was put in the pledge in the 1950's. I doubt he would care, because he was for seperation of church and state. Besides doesn't forcing a pledge of alliegance in a supposed free country seem a bit wrong? It is something the soviet government would force on their children.<P>Open your mind and learn to think for yourself. Also learn that there isn't one right way and that suppressing ideas is what the current government is all about. They want to suspend the bill of rights. Is that being patriotic? Our current government wants to start yet another illegal war. Is that patriotic?<P>The basic tenent of our judicial system is that it is better for 100 guilty men to go free then for one innocent man to be jailed. That principle goes back to day one. Freeing wrongfully convicted <P>I would prefer a horny president over the evil, brain-dead, traitorous president we have now. Clinton had many faults and was in many ways a bad president but he was far better then Bush is.<P>Conservative:<P>Putting rich businessmen first.<P>Screwing the poor at every turn<P>Making illegal arms sales to a dangerous nation and using the profits to support murderous right wing dictators<P>Causing massive federal debt<P>Pardoning criminals and giving them jobs at high levels of government<P>Break federal laws and try to cover them up<P>"I am not a crook"<P>Send more and more americans into a illegal and needless war, even though they knew it would never be won( granted Kennedy/Johnson sent the first troops, but Nixon really escalated it. He had to do something to divert attention away from him, and conservatives are infamous for freely giving up our soldiers lives as a means to deflect attention from there evil deeds. Both Bush morons are masters of it)<P>Attempt to stifle free speech<P>Support polluters and invite them to capital hill to write enviromental laws.<P>Allow biggots into their ranks and defend them.<P>Ya, conservatives are just peachy<P>I would respond to more, but your post is filled with so much ignorance and outright close-mindedness that it doesn't deserve a response. The only thing you proved is that your lack of understanding about what this country's principles were founded on.<P>"No. It is mine. It is what I make of it."<P>How can a country be yours?
