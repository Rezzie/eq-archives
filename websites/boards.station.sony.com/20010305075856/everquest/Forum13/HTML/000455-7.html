</FONT><HR>warriors are a BASE class... that means every other melee class is a variation on the warrior theme (except bards)... so you MUST compare them to warriors because that is where they came from<P>verant should have just made 1 melee class... the warrior... and saved themselves the headache of these class balance issues (but they wanted their game to have variety)<P>and another thing...<P>VERY FEW PEOPLE test and parse their logs, very few people actually know first-hand the damage output of monks, rogues, warriors etc etc etc<P>i post alot because WHEN A CHANGE GETS MADE... im damn sure going to post EXACTLY what that change was and how it affected us in terms of numbers<P>thats right, im policing Verant, so when they come back and say they made SWEEPING MAJOR changes to monk damage output... ill be there to tell the general masses just HOW MUCH change they really made<P>just like our press and media monitors our government... think of all the stuff our government would have kept secret and gotten away with if the media didnt expose them for the frauds and scandals they did!<P>right now Verant is trying to cover up the monk-scandal... i for one am not going to let that happen ;-)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>oooh got me on a cover-up scandal theme... here i go!  these are all PROPAGANDA spread by Verant to keep people in the dark about the monk class problems (i just love a juicy scandal!)<P>----MISCONCEPTION #1<BR>ABASHI stated monks do the most damage toe-to-toe... leading to his infamous 'monks rock!' quote<P>testing shows that monks maybe do 5-10% more damage at lvl 60 than a warrior... so technically ABASHI might be correct... but what is 5-10% really?<P>average lvl 60 warrior damage max hasted is 50dmg per sec (or 3000dmg per min)... monks will do an extra 2-5 dmg per sec extra (or 120-300dmg per min extra)<P>so monks CAN DO 120-300dmg per MINUTE more than a warrior (considering the average fight is 2 minutes long, and monsters have 10,000+ hit points that we fight at these levels)... is that even worth not being able to TANK, TAUNT, and have 1000 hp less, 100ac less?... i didnt think so<P>----MISCONCEPTION #2<BR>ABASHI has stated that monks get special skill points in certain OFFENSE skills that reach the max of their skill tables (251 and 252)... he claimed that these 2 points were DIFFERENT from normal skill increases and provided the monk class with a significant boost in ability<P>this is all bull-crap, yes we get 2 extra skill points in some offense abilities... those are basically just 2 more skill points and nothing else<P>----MISCONCEPTION #3<BR>monks are a special privileged class that DOES NOT have to rely on armor/weapons to be effective<P>hahahahahahhaahahahahahahhahahhahahhahahahahaahh.....<P>ok sorry, well to point out some things, YES monks get an armor class boost... this has been very nicely balanced by our weight restrictions and the lack of high AC armor for monks... the same can be said for weapons, yes our fists make nice weapons, but they are hardly comparable to common weapons like Jade Mace 9dmg 18dly that any lvl 30+ melee can get fairly easily<P>so while it is TRUE that a naked monk will have more AC and fight better than a naked warrior... that really isnt a valid point since this represents like less than 1% of playing time<P>oh and a naked lvl 60 monk has like 776 armor class... yea thats really going to be effective against monsters he will be fighting ;-)<P>----MISCONCEPTION #4<BR>monks TAUNT as well as warriors because a warrior cannot TAUNT a monster off a monk<P>while it MIGHT BE TRUE that a warrior cannot taunt a monster off a monk (that monk should FD then).. this has absolutely NOTHING to do with the ability to TAUNT OFF CASTERS... monks build hate in monsters gradually over many attacks... when a caster casts a spell he might instantly leap-frog the monk on the hate list.... at this point the monk can do NOTHING to increase his hate faster to be on top again... all he can do is keep attacking and hope... warriors can TAUNT which instantly boosts their hate upwards like a spell which gives them the ability to PULL OFF a caster on demand (paladins and sks can also do this, and can also cast spells as well to achieve the same effect)<P>----MISCONCEPTION #5<BR>monks are balanced because they can beat other melee classes in a DUEL<P>first let me say that dueling is not even considered CLASS BALANCE... its just a fun way to blow off steam<P>i will clear up this misconception very easily... RANGERS can beat warriors in a duel ;-)<P>----MISCONCEPTION #6<BR>monks are the BEST PULLERS around... that is their special skill for groups!<P>first, monks pull using Feign Death... which is also available to SHADOWKNIGHTS and NECROS as well!<P>secondly, Verant has PUBLICLY stated that FD pulling is not in their VISION... and that they are against it... see zones like Velious and Hole... they have tried to eliminate FD pulling alltogether<P>currently the best puller is a Ranger snare / Mage call-hero combo<P>-------------<P>hehe this was fun to compile... i hope some of you see the humor and the irony in some of these misconceptions!<P>if you have any extras to add feel free!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You mentioned possibly adding serpent sight or maybe ac to the treant fists. Would it be possible for you to consider adding summon bandage. It's not gonna mess up the economy but it will save the monks a little stress of having to run X number of zones if bandages run out. Just an idea.

</FONT><HR>Reposted from the ABSOR, what good are monks thread.<P>Hmmm. Ive been thinking a lot, which is generally a endevour most of my friends suggest I refrain from. But I think I have come up with something.<BR>Here is a solution to our monk woes! It will solve several problems all at once, and is really just conformation of what is already in place.<P>THE REVISED FEIGN DEATH!<P>When you FD any and all mobs that have you on their hate list do the following:<P>1) Immeadeately stop their actions, attacks, and castings. Essentially a 5 second AOE stun, during which:<BR>2) All said mobs target the feigned monk, and proceed to do the 'point' emote.<BR>3) All said mobs proceed to do the 'laugh' emote.<BR>4) All said mobs proceed to attack the feigned monk, using only their kick attacks, which will have a special knock back effect on the fiegned charicter.<BR>5) Randomly, one of the specially agrod mobs will shout out "Kick the baby!", "No! No! Dont kick the baby!", or simply "Goooaaaaaalll!"<BR>6) The mobs will continue with their game of kick the corpse untill the monk unfeigns, or a full minute has passed since the monk has actually died, as presumably the body has begun to go all mushy and the game isnt as fun anymore.<P>I think that this effect is very valid as It would give an interrupt ability to the monk class, as well as a stun. It removes the requirement to make feign actually work as intended. And finally, it gives the monk class a unique and usefull ability to a group, as the mobs will be so engrosed in the already very popular game of kick the corpse, (which nearly every post 30 mob is an avid fan and participant) they will likely not even notice the rest of the party.<P>Hope this helps<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Doubt this will ever be seen as its 246 out of 246 posts, but hey..ya never know....<P>I'd like to see more 'thrown' weapons for Monks and Rogues.  For instance, a Sling that is tailored and sling bullets that are stackable and made by smithing.  Make them, say, 1 damage, and 100 range or so.  would be great for pulling for Monks and Rogues, and encourage the use of tradeskills.<P>Along that line, perhaps allow new bow strings to be tailored as well with different positives and negatives to the overall finished bow.  <P>-Gihl</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Its not often that I post here, read, but not post. I've plays my Monk since the 1st day the game was available in the UK and have loved every minute of it.<BR>I stopped play him for 7 months after the original FD enhancment. I didn't play him again till well after Kunark was released.<BR>Having made most of 51 levels mixing solo and group play, I think the only 2 things I'd like to see are this.<P>A clear staement from Verant as to the Vision of a Monk.<P>If this Vision is the high end damage dealer we were always told then I'd like to see a very simple solution to it. Give us a minimum damage on all H2H attacks (this would include our special attacks), scale the damage base on our level. This would result in an increase in damage and less Monky magic for 1 or 2 points damage.<P>Before the nerf &lt;cough&gt; enhancment to FD I always thought of a Monk as a backup to a Tank and a backup to the Enchanter.<P>Now like may Monks I just feel I'm a mana sink with no real benifits.<P>Give us more damage and give us a reason to be in groups, make us Physical Enchanters again with FD.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
