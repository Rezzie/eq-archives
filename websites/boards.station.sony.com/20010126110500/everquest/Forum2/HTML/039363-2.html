</FONT><HR>I'm just saying that Shaman don't suck just because they added a weapon that procs slow.  Weapons proc just about everything else too, but you can only use one at a time, or is this 1hs, not lore and a common drop that will be like axe of the iron back?  Will rogues and rangers use this over other weapons because of the taunt or lack thereof?<P>What is the other information?  If this makes shaman obsolete, by all means remove it, but I just dont think it will.  It doesnt even make you less effective for all I know.  Does it make you do less damage, or make your buffs not stack, or make your roots and dots and dd's less efficient? Does it affect your "companion" or your debuffs or break root or negate your heals somehow?<P>It proc's a slow spell (that we know of).<BR>Even Shaman can use it.  go get one and be an even better slower than you are now and show up that mean ole rogue with your melee proc. (if your group will let you)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>C'mon guys, obviously Rogues haven't been improved enough yet.  You know as well as I that they are so worthless in the high level game *laughs sarcastically*.<P>The only thing Verant does consistently with Class Balance is make the wrong decisions... and then continue to make them ad infinitum.  This is probably why they want to close class balance issues, because they are utterly incompentent in that realm, specifically in the high level game.<P>It has to make you wonder when your someone like me who plays 3 different high-level classes, and its totally obvious who the powerful ones are... yet they continue to increase those same classes power, whether it be by weapons or by skills or by dungeon or by mob design.<P>I'll give a quick rundown of the most recent class balance blunders, but then again, most of the players already know them:<P>1.  Problem: Necros aren't grouping enough.  Verant Solution:  Well, its obviously because they have no grouping abilities.  Lets give them component resurrections, improved mana feeding spells, partial undead mezzes and charms, and corpse summoning, in additon to their insane solo abilities.  That will fix it!  Proper Solution:  Either keep them the best solo class in the game, or nerf some of their soloability in exchange for group friendly spell casting.  Don't give them both, and now wonder why they are so powerful, and you have to do things like nerf their spells and epic weapons to compensate.<P>2.  Problem:  Rogues aren't a good class, noone wants them in groups.  Solution:  Increase their power drastically and rediculously over the course of several months until they are one of the best classes in the game.  When we get done with that, make the new zones were putting out have more places that require a rogue.  When we finish that, lets give them weapons that proc Lvl 60 versions of pure classes spells.  Basically, we must perpetually enhance the rogue, even when it may appear that we have overbalanced them; we can never do enough to make it up to those rogues!  Proper Solution:  Initial increases of the class justified.  Inclusions of more zones and places where rogues would be wanted also justified.  Continuing to try and 'fix' a problem which has long since been corrected with the classes' balance is rediculous and unneeded.<P>Again, I reiterate, without going into the specific class balance issues that exist in the high level game right now, that Verant has proven itself both totally incapable of class balance, and totally incapable of maintaining class balance when it exists.<P>This weapon is simply another in a long and seemingly unending line of rogue enhancements that have been in progress for the past 6 months.  At this rate, I expect Rogues to be able to Complete Heal and cast your slow spells without even needing to rely on this silly weapon, so prepare for it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Guys, <BR>I just read this somewhere, so it HAS to be true (no matter what). rogues are now called 'shamans with pokers', and have access to all shaman spells. They can turgur's, malosi, root, and chain cast those neat ice spells. They have just as much mana, and a higher channeling cap (They get hit more in battle, so they NEED it).

</FONT><HR>Several Things...<P>Valantor:<BR>---------<BR>&gt;&gt; people say procs are unreliable. lol ask any dual wielding ranger with double attack how often he procs in a average fight.<P>1 to 5 times. Sometimes not at all.<BR>(and more often then not, not at the start of the fight, see below)<P>&gt;&gt; Now add in the fact that a proc has no cast time and cant be interrupted. hell i often get resisted on slow and have to wait for the recycle time and the recasting before i can get slow to stick.<P>See, an Ykesha or whatnot proc gets resisted too. And I can't just wait until recast time... I have to wait for the thing to proc again. Whenever that may be.<P>&gt;&gt; i fail to see how this is different from a melee waiting to proc.<P>Easy. You *know* that your spell will be available in another 2 seconds or whatnot. A melee with a proc weapon has no idea when or if it will proc again.<P>----<BR>On the timing of procs:<P>Snare procs: No matter when they proc, any time during the fight is ok.<P>Slow procs: I can solo Ice Giants (if they are slowed with Turgur). If I have to rely on a weapon to proc, it better should proc in the first 30 seconds of the fight or I am green goo on the floor.<P>There is a difference here. You may notice it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Damage of 13, delay of 20.<P>As if that wasn't enough?  Nope, we gotta put the *ONLY* CLASS DEFINING spell that SHAMAN have on it.  I do NOT at all think this weapon should proc its' current spell.  I'm really sick and tired of being smacked around like this.  **** YOU VERANT.<P>Let's suppose for a second that Shaman no longer had their slow line.  Would you want them in your group?  ....  Thought so.<P>Casters don't want my hp buff.  MELEE don't want my hp buff sometimes (stave of shielding).  Clerics buff ac better than I do.  Enchanters can buff Dex MUCH higher than I can (werewolf form).  Druids have a str buff and agi buff.  Druids get GROUP regens.  Necro's don't have to cast their hp to mana spells EVERY GODDAMN SECOND.  Post 50 my dots are no longer top of the line.  Mages get my resistance debuffing spells.  Verant THOUGHT that Shaman actually spend a lot of their time in MELEE post 50 (proc on original Spear of Fate anyone?)..but yet we like other NON MELEE classes suck at it.  Gordon makes comments about the JBB being overpowered..so what do they do?  They give the most powerful class in the game a right-click DD bracer (necro's get a bracer that casts ignite bones in velious, 16sec cast time, ~500dmg).  Verant continues with our ever so useful AE spells by giving us rain of sickness at level 50.<P>So what is there to like about a Shaman?  Very little left to like.  The Shaman class is obviously the most "..well we need to give them something, but what?" class in the game.  Oh..I like one thing.  Group Charisma.  Really can't wait till 58 to get that one.<P>Why Verant?  Why?  13/20!!  And the BEST SLOW IN THE GAME.<P>Keep it up.  I swear to god I'll be leaving the game the moment you put that uber group charisma buff on the next 15/19 1hs that's found.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

This weapon we are worried about proc's something for rogues that is in fact *better* than a shaman's level 51 spell.<P>So, let's say VI adds new weapons that follow this pattern, taking the most popular 50+ spells from each casting class and making them proc for rogues, only a little better.  (Or any melee class for that matter.) <P>If you're a wizard and VI gave rogues a weapon that procs something better than Lure of Frost, would that be just fine with you?  Or would you say something?<P>Okay, what if you're a magician and you found out about a new rogue weapon that procs Vocerate Earth, only the summoned pet hits for more than yours?<P>Druids?  Would you be upset if a new rogue weapon procs Legacy of Spikes?  You can have your 20pp for the port, but I'm grouping with that rogue.<P>Need I go on?<P>Again, this is a legitimate concern for all pure casters, not just shamans.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here you are bashing Verant for giving melees a weapon of power, yet don't you know the REAL reason why Verant is doing this?<P>They are running out of ideas.<P>Melees are all about items, weapons, and armor.  Verant do not want to give 100 ac items or 40/10 weapons because that would overpower melees, but nor can they think of anything to give to melees that they haven't already.  So they put out these proc weapons with other class' defining abilities in order to provide a couple of new and fresh weapons for Velious buyers.  C'mon guys, when you see weapons/armor with maybe +1/-1 ac/stat changes and things like the talisman(Nos with -1 stat) and necro boots that cast invis(don't they already have an item that does this? heh), you know Verant is running low on ideas.<P>I don't think there will be another expansion, unless something revolutionary about items is implemented into EQ.  The reason is not that Verant can't come up with more zones and monsters(plenty of that), but that _anyone_ would find it hard to come up with new and original items in a game with thousands if not tens of thousands of existing items.<P>Sadly, casters will be left out of items again and again.  This is because in trying to maintain class balance, Verant will by no means give casters weapon & armor that'll make them tanks.  So what do they do? They give casters resist gear, mana/hp gear, and items that cast lesser spells for no mana or new effects that are an improvement over some past spell.  You can only do so many items with these kind of ideas.<P>I find it funny sometimes when low level melees complain that they can't solo what casters can... E.g. why are casters always so much better... But that in the end, it is the tanks that gain more and more power as they progress, whereas casters merely stagnate, since their true power - the spells - are not only less powerful as they go on, but also considered a balance of the class, and not of risk vs. reward.<BR>  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Tekke_Prexus writes:<P>"Shamans you get a 12/19 weapon in velious, best ratio in the game, but no one is complaining."<P>Yeah, because Shaman everywhere are dying to get this so they can finally contribute those AWESOME melee skills to their group.  This is something Shaman should have, as of the pure priests, we are the most melee oriented.  Nerf it!  I don't care, I'll go back to using my Jade Prod.  You know how often I melee?  You know how little damage I do?  1hb/2hb/piercing/h2h.  No duel wield, no double attack.  Offense caps at 200, as do 1hb/2hb/piercing/and maybe h2h.  We do not get bonuses.  I have the Rune Etched Icewurm Fang (12/19 5wis 35mana), buffed I have 204str, and with werewulf form I have 944atk.  190 skill in piercing, 200 in offense.  The hardest I've hit is 45.  So don't go trying to compare apples to dead cats.  If I'm meleeing it's because I have a lot of mana and I'm just screwing around..I could nuke for 430 then sit and med.  But hey I know, I'll just get into a group full of warriors that have this new 13/20 and I'll melee along with em.  Forget having to cast that 250mana Turgur's Insects ever again.  Don't need to dot either cause Necro's have my ebolt...but I could use Plague, that really long disease dot..but OH WAIT NECROS GET THAT ONE ALSO.  <P>Because I'm so overpowered now.<P>Get real.<P>This thread isn't about the Ranger FA anyways (but I still don't see why verant has such a hardon for rangers getting weapons that cast a form of slow).  The Ranger FA is pretty nice..kudos for them getting something good.<P>This thread is about a really fantastic weapon that has a high level Shamans equal in slowing ability.<P>Mistmorgue writes:<P>"They are running out of ideas."<P>That's your opinion.

This comment to me would seem to be that he has a level 60 shaman, but he has claimed in a previous post that he hated his epic and that shaman epic was overpowered and too good for shaman to have.<P>I think Thogg is a troll in more ways then his race.

</FONT><HR>Wow, you know, it's good to see other people with my class ability, because that means I won't need to waste my time grouping with anyone.  And hey, this weapon looks like it's better than my Epic Weapon.. I think I'll switch.<P>Get real.  The Spear of Fate should have had a better slow than any of the ones we can cast.  Look at Enchanters, they get a buff that gives the highest Haste in a spell in game.  Why can't we get something that's comparable, rather than a dot that can be overwritten by a level 51 necro?<P>The seeming point of the Epic Weapons (as seen by the Mage, Enchanter, Cleric weapons) for casting classes is to keep these classes off their butts because they have to spend mana so often on their most expensive spells (haste, pets, revivesence).. As a Shaman, and I dunno about you, I usually end up OOM all the time from constant attempts at slowing mobs.  Oh I'll eventually get it, but it may take anywhere from 3/4 of a bubble of mana to a whole bar, depending on the mob's resistance.  Now imagine if we had an instant casting (like the other casters) slow... Imagine how much mana that would leave us for... omg.. BUFFING.  (Don't we still do that?)  <P>There's the issue of the balancing of the game, and if giving us a slow would be overpowering.. Well, damn... someone just found a weapon with the slow that SHOULD have been on our Epic Weapon.  Can we pull an ol' switcheroo here?  Please?<P>/em begs Verant desperately.<P>I'd rather use the nifty particle weapon over a droppable Velious weapon anyday!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It doesn't matter if Procs are unreliable.  In the post 50 game shaman are one of the classes competing for the few slots left in the "ideal" group that everyone seems to think they need -- Cleric, Chanter, Warrior, Monk/Rogue, Evaccer and X.<P>Given a warrior and/or rogue with a weapon that procs slow in that group, and that the chanter can slow almost as well if the procs don't cover it, odds are the shaman doesn't have much hope for that last slot.  Grab a mage instead of the shaman and you get debuffing almost as good as the shaman and another 3/4 tank.  Grab a necro and you have the same great DoTs + more.<P>In the Expanded world of Kunark and Velious, our spells have been watered down in the post 50 game, and given away to a half dozen other classes in a form that is as strong, or nearly so. Mages that were always behind us in the MalX line are no longer far behind (if at all), Necros have our DoT staples, Enchanters can slow to within 5% of shaman, and they now have an avatar like buff with a better Dexterity increase than the best shaman Dex spell that ALSO raises ATTACK (far more useful) and gives a lifetap proc.  Our slow spells are found on several different weapons.<P>I love playing a shaman.  I think we are an incredibly interesting class.  We are great in the less-than-ideal groups because we are so versitile we can make up for the lack of most other classes.  We are even better in a good balanced group.  The problem is that most people have a very narrow view of the world and think that they *must* have certain classes to be successful or efficient while adventuring. And shaman often don't fit in the players vision of that ideal group -- especially when you can grab a member that fills the hole in your group that a shaman would -- but has even more use than the shaman.<P>In theory I have no problem with other classes having the same or similar spell lines as shaman, and I don't mecessarily think others should be nerfed.  But little by little we are running out of things that we do best, without gaining any new spell lines or skills to compensate.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/039363-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/039363.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/039363-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/039363-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/039363-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/039363-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=039363&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=039363&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
