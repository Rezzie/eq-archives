</FONT><HR>To reply to Deringer:<P>1. Root parking:<P> "Since the most efficient and effective rootparking is done by any number of classes *without* ever taking a hit, the paladin does it *marginally* better than anyone else with the 'root' spell."<P>  No, you're wrong here.  Root parking very often requires that a mob be PULLED away from the group.  Doing this inevitably requires taunting, taking damage, and rooting.  This is something ONLY a paladin can do.  You also conveniently neglect the fact that WARRIORS CANNOT DO THIS AT ALL.  We aren't comparing wizards to paladins here.  We are comparing warriors to paladins.  <P>"Root Parking is about the same as getting two warriors in the group and tanking seperate mobs in the high level game" <P> Wrong again.  Two warriors tanking separate mobs means that the cleric must take TWICE as much mana for heals as in the situation where the paladin simply root parks one of them.  What game are you playing anyway?  Anyone who has played the high level game should know this.  Again, this is a highly useful skill that warriors do not have **AT ALL**.  <P>2.  Lay on Hands. <P> "I would argue with you, however, that most groups at the high level game have a cleric in the group with near as fast heals which serve the same purpose." <P>  Wrong.  Complete heal is the only spell clerics get that heals this many hp, and complete heal has a 10 second cast time, which makes it useless for saving someone who is very close to death.  Even superior heal has a ***MUCH*** longer cast time than LoH, and it doesn't heal nearly as many hp.  A large percentage of the deaths in groups happen because more than one person gets in trouble at the same time.  In these cases, the primary healer CANNOT save both persons because of the casting times of the heal spells.  Just to avoid attempts at obscuring the basic fact here, I repeat: LoH HEALS OVER 2000 HP, AND DOES IT WITH ZERO CAST TIME.  If you try to tell anyone that understands the game that this is not useful, they will just laugh at you. <P>3. Superior heal.  <P>"The fizzle rate approaches 40% however, and surely you know this from your vast knowledge of the high level game. You also know that with a Paladin's mana pool, he can cast about 1 of these, possibly 2, after each battle, but more realistically 1, without going OOM after a few pulls. (In other words, the Paladin can cast, on average, 1.5 of these heals after each battle, saving the Cleric about 750hp of healing downtime per battle in an exp group)."  <P> Once again, your arguments are filled with errors.  1. The fizzle rate on superior heal is only high THE FIRST LEVEL YOU GET IT.  The fizzle rate on superior heal is nowhere near 40% at level 60.  2. Your figures regarding the number of times the paladin can cast SH between fights also depend heavily on the situation, so your figure of 1.5 times is meaningless.  3. In any case however, your figure of 750 hp healed between fights from 1.5 casts of SH ONCE AGAIN IS TOTALLY WRONG.  Superior heal heals approximately 600 hp.  600 x 1.5 = 900, not 750.  Even other paladins in this thread have agreed with me that superior heal is useful.  Healing 900 hp between fights DOES save the cleric a lot of mana, and saving the cleric mana = saved lives.  Like your math, your arguments simply do not add up here.  <P>4. Buffs.  <BR> <BR>  "I disagree with you almost 100%. Currently, less than 1-5% of all high level groups go clericless in the 51-60 game. If you are fighting in clericless groups anymore than this percentage of the time, you are either at the very bottom end of this curve (low 50s), or you are playing a different game than me."<P> Where did this 1-5% figure come from?  Have you done research on this to obtain this figure, or did you just pull it out of thin air to make your arguments sound good?  Once again, my arguments are based on clear data and evidence that anyone can obtain.  Just zone into Karnor's or Sebilis sometime and count the number of people in the zone (not counting ungrouped people at the zone), and then count the number of clerics.  You will find that the number of clerics in the zone is nowhere near 1/6.  THIS PROVES THAT LOTS OF GROUPS OUT THERE HUNT WITHOUT CLERICS AND DO JUST FINE.  In fact, I remember one day in Karnor's where there were over 20 people in the zone AND ZERO CLERICS.  Again, supporting your case by saying things that are easily proven false doesn't do much for your credibility here.   <P>"A clericless group cannot approach the kill rate of the non-cleric group by anything even close. The cleric group will kill almost twice the number of mobs as the aforementioned clericless one"<P> Even more "statistics" from you that seem to have come out of thin air.  Have you examined groups that were identical except one having a cleric and the other a shaman, and measured precisely their kill rates?  I think I'm pretty safe here in saying the answer to this one is no.  A group with a shaman as primary healer can do almost as well as one with a cleric for several reasons.  1. Shamen don't need to heal as well as clerics, because their "slow" line of spells SERIOUSLY decreases the damage that groups take in the first place.  You don't need to heal damage that never gets done to begin with.  2. Regen is more mana efficent than any healing spell clerics get.  3. Shamen can also give the melee classes attack speed buffs, which INCREASES THE GROUP'S DAMAGE OUTPUT ALLOWING THEM TO KILL MOBS FASTER.   <P>5. 90% experience res<P> "At level 59 this spell is window dressing. I have used it exactly ONCE in a group situation where it helped my group"<P>  No flame intended here, but if you are one of those players that won't kill an orc pawn without a cleric nearby, then this is not surprising.  However, as I have said above, it isn't necessary to have a cleric in your group to do well, nor is it always possible to have a cleric when you hunt, unless you stubbornly refuse to do anything without one.  Again, what percentage of high level players do you think is a cleric?   The percentage of ungrouped players in a high level dungeon is always small.  MOST players, at any one time, will be grouped and actively hunting.  Since the number of clerics is nowhere near 1 in 6, this clearly means that other people are not being as insistent on having a cleric as you are.  Any time you are in a group that doesn't have a cleric, that 90% exp res will be very useful when someone dies.  <P>"Noone my level wants this rez, and will wait hours for a 56+ rez, which any cleric withing 4 levels of me, and sometimes less, can cast."   <P> I hate to sound repetitive here, but you are wrong.   Most people only wait hours for a res if no one in their group can do a res.   Even at level 59, a death with a 90% experience res only meant 1.5 to 2 hours worth of lost experience.  A death with a 96% res means slightly less than half that much lost experience.  That translates to about an hour's worth of experience that you lose from taking a 90% res instead of a 96% res.  Most people DO NOT spend hours searching and waiting for a 96% res (often having to drag the corpse a long distance through dangerous areas to another group so their cleric can res you, then make it back ok), just to save one hour's worth of experience, when the level 59 paladin in their group could just do a res right there that gets 90% of the experience back.  The ability to do an experience res is most of the reason that people want clerics as primary healers.  <P>"First off, I will say that the Warrior is the more efficient and better tank choice, flat out now, and even after the proposed changes are made."   <P> If hybrids get enhancements to their dodge, parry, and riposte skills as well as defense, and if the changes go through to defensive discipline, then the warrior ability to take damage will be only slightly better than a hybrid.  Combine that with the fact that hybrids taunt **much** better than warriors and I don't agree at all that the warrior will be a better tank.  On mobs that are over level 50, taunt actually has a pretty low percent chance of being sucessful.  This VASTLY increases the importance of the hybrid's ability to taunt with spells, since these spells taunt successfully even if they are resisted.  <P>  "It is the same reason why Hybrids have never supported you in your moves to have taunt increased in the past because it would further make it so that Hybrids has ABSOLUTELY no place in a group if a Warrior was around (where it is currently somewhere around 95%)."  <P>  Hybrids **DO** support the warrior request for better taunting ability.  Just read the warrior thread if you don't believe me.  Quite a few hybrids agreed that warriors should get improvements to taunt.  Secondly, your 95% figure for the number of groups that contain a warrior is yet another false statistic that you have pulled out of thin air to make your argument sound good.  Nowhere near 95% of groups have a warrior.  (See my explanation regarding the percetage of groups that have a cleric if you need evidence that I'm right.  The same arguments apply in this case).  <P> "...it isn't a secret that people are leveling clerics, warriors and rogues right now. There is also a reason why, of course, some of you are too blind to see it." <P>  There are far more druids than clerics right now, too, yet the druids are screaming and complaining also.  The number of people playing a class means very little.   The number of people that currently play hybrids is utterly meaningless for another reason, too.   Verant has recently made a number of BIG enhancements to hybrids (including taking away the experience penalty), and soon is going to enhance them even more.  All of these changes are happening in a VERY short time.  Can you know what the long term effects are going to be of the changes that have already been made?  No.  Not enough TIME has passed.  It will take TIME to see how much the popularity of hybrids will be improved by the changes that have already been made.  So, pointing out that there are currently more warriors than hybrids is meaningless.  <P>"I, however, suspect that the majority of the whiners are either a.) nowhere near level 60, or b.) suffering from class envy where none is justified."<BR> <BR> I hate to break it to you, man, but the majority of the "whiners" (your word, not mine) are HYBRIDS.  It's the hybrids that have screamed and hollered for months, begging to get every single advantage that warriors get.  (Note, NOT asking to have their own abilities improved.  No sir.  They have been asking to get what warriors have.)  <P> What advantages have warriors traditionally had over hybrids to compensate for not getting spells?  <P>1. more hp.  <P>2. higher ac. <P>3. disciplines<P>4. higher melee skill caps.  <P> What are hybrids asking for?  What have they been asking for the last few months?   Here's the list...<P>1.  more hp.  (very common request in the hybrid talk threads).  <P>2. higher ac (they are getting this one, due to the defense skill improvement).<P>3. disciplines (hybrids cried that warriors got disciplines and they didn't so Verant gave hybrids disciplines)<P>4. higher melee skill caps. (Well, what do you know?  Hybrids want this too!  Again, check the hybrid talk threads!)  <P>If you think that hybrids are underpowered, then why not ask to have YOUR OWN UNIQUE ABILITIES improved?  But, for the most part, hybrids haven't been asking for that.  They just want what warriors have.   <P>And you accuse WARRIORS of class envy?   Now THAT is funny.  <P>  There is NOT ONE SINGLE ADVANTAGE that warriors have over hybrids that the hybrids aren't asking to have erased.  The question is, how much is Verant going to listen?  Just how far are they going to go in erasing the warrior advantages?  I don't know yet, but I suspect they will go too far.  If hybrids get everything they are asking for, a hybrid will basically be a warrior that also gets spells.  That's as unbalancing as it can get. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wow Rainblade wish i could post arguments like you. I just want to ask you people where do you get your figures from. Im not being sarcastic i swear. <P>   I just play the game. I dont crunch numbers i guess, because i dont care to do that much work. I am just basically mad that Hybrids are geting things they supposedly sacrificed for spells. <P>  People say well its to balance the game, but by given the Hybrids these changes dosnt that move the Baseline? <P>  Warriors sacrificed spells for tanking prowess. If Hybrids get these upgrades then why cant warriors get spells? Isnt that only balanced.<P>  The people who say well warriors shouldnt have spells are probaly the same people who want hybrids to be basiclly warriors with spells.<BR>   <BR>  I dont want spells what i would like to see is warriors melle prowess increased. Im not talking 1 or 2 more points per hit. I think a fair trade since hybrids get our (warrior) offense and defense traits is to increase the damage cap of warriors so its not even a close comparsion of who does more damage. Yes im mean hybrids going full nuke comparison. <P>  I think a warrior Should out damage a hybrid by about 150% . So a hybrid who did 1000 points of damage in melle a warrior of same level should do 1000x1.5=1,500+1000=2500 melle damage(there i did some crunching). To the hybrids that would say no way that would be overpowering i say put a 55 warrior (with this increase in damage cap) against a 50 level mob who wins? Also Warriors would still be no where near the damage output of rogues. <P>   Why wouldnt this be fair?<BR>    </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
