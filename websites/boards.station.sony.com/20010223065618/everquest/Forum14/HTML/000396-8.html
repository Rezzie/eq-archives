</FONT><HR>Absor there have been a bunch of good suggestions for making stat buffs more viable.  <P>Again we are not asking that you change the way stats work in the game, we are asking that, since we are the "King of Buffs" that our largely useless stat buffs have a little somethng extra added to them to make the spells that take up the majority of our spellbooks a bit more useful.<P>Please just add the stat buff issue to the list and have the team look at it, that's all we ask.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>/boggle<P>ok, yes Topors heals 1200 hps for 100 mana (if the numbers on castersrealm are accurate) BUT and this is a BIG but, a) it takes 1 minute to cast, b) it roots the target, c) it slows the target, d) it drains mana from the target, and e) it's group only. Add to this that it's an NPC spell drop and well, it all looks pretty uslelss to me. <P>Now compare that with Natures touch... 900 some odd hp's, instant effect, 5.5 sec cast time and it's vendor purchaseable, WITHOUT any of the negative side effects of Topors.<P>I know that as it is, I personally won't even bother trying to aquire Topors, unless some changes are made to it. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have a shaman friend who is very frustrated and close to quitting.  He says it seems that shamans are being eliminated from the game as other classes are enhanced.  The main issues are:<P>Alchemy is still badly broken, there's not much useful to make after SoW that's not prohibitively expensive and/or purchasable from vendors for lower prices.  <P>Stat buffs are not useful, they're generally only cast for placebo effect.  I suggest making them mean something.  <P>Debuffs are resisted so much they're just a mana sink.  This may be partly because races that can be shamans (especially trolls) have low charisma.  I suggest reducing resistances or (if applicable) increasing charisma of races that have problems with it.  This could perhaps be done by adding race specific items.  <P>Currently shamans have very little that would make them useful or desirable in groups  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">  Please help.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

We are supposed to be *MASTERS* of buffs anyway so having our buffs do more than others is not completely out of line. Enchanters have so much more they can do.<P>"Dex doesn't add anything to ATK.

</FONT><HR>I just wanted to make a quick suggestion.  Bane of Nife and Pox of Bertoxx are on the list for a possible damage upgrade.  After getting a new DoT 2 out of every 3 ranks up to level 49, it seems a little odd that we go from rank 11 (49) to rank 17 (56) before getting another upgrade.<P>Perhaps moving Bane of Nife to level 53, moving Pox to level 56, and adding a final poison DoT at 59 that does just a little more damage than Pox (except in 42 seconds) would be appropriate.<P>Just a quick comparison as more evidence: (all of these numbers are taken from Casters' Realm)<P>Envenomed Bolt (Shm[49] Nec[51], 1132dmg 320mana, 42s)<BR>Splurt (Nec[51], ~1600dmg, 287mana, 96s)<BR>Winged Death (Dru[53], 1287dmg, 350mana, 54s)<BR>Bane of Nife (Shm[56], 1648dmg, 425mana, 42s)<P>I realize that Druids don't get another DoT after Winged Death, and Necromancers get 4 more DoTs from level 56-59, but Shamans have always been somewhere between the two others in DoT ability.  The damage on a level 53 version of Bane may need to be reduced a little, but I think the general idea would restore the pre-50 balance of DoT power.<P>Binen<BR>53 Mystic</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Why should it cost 350 mana?  A 13% improvement is significant, albeit barely so, but that's what our buffs need, to offer significant improvement, else they be not worth the mana to cast in the first place.   As for what makes people think shaman are intended to be the master buffers, I suspect our spell list, especially post 50 points to that.  Mind you, I know damn well in practice, buffing is secondary to our role of debuffer...  I think it's quite clear that part of our role was indeed in part to play "buff slave" to the tanks, like it or not.  Shaman are built around buffing/debuffing, but half the equasion is broken (only haste buffs offer significant improvement, and we're second or third rate when it comes to them), the other half done almost as well by other classes who have their own roles (enchanters for slows, despite already having the crowd control specialty, and mages for mala, despite the DD/Pet focus).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>When I started playing EQ I looked over the classes spells, and what various web sites said about the classes and races.<P>I went, hmmm.. looks like a Troll shaman can Melee a bit, and do some healling, has decient dots, and a decient pet, and wow look at all the buff spells.  Shamans have got to be awsome in agroup.<P>I cant speak for all shamans but being the master of slowing the mob down was not what I had envisioned.<P>What Shamans sell as when you look the class over without knowledge of the game systems flaws is:<P>1.  OK Melee (note this is not Tanking, just ability to land a hit)<BR>2.  Decient DoTs.  Nothing huge, but fair at both.<BR>3.  After suffering without a pet for 33 levels I get one, and it will be awsome.<BR>4.  I have some healing abilities that are second to the clerics<BR>5.  I have a few debuff abilities.<BR>6.  Most of all I am a buffer.  Look at all those stat buff spells, not to mention HP buffs, AC buffs, and Haste buffs.<P>What you end up with:<P>1.  I can Do OK damage at low levels Meleeing, and can never really tank.  Tanking was not implied but being able to Melee was.  Let down number 1.<BR>2.  I can use DoTs to solo, but there just not effective in a group.  They suck beucase they take to long and the mob is dead before 50% of the damage from your poison line has worked, and before 25% of your desease line is done.  This makes the desease line back of the book material and the poison line useful once in a while.  Just use your ineficiant DD spells if you want to do some damage in a group, but wait you don't have enough mana to be effective with those.  Let down number 2.<BR>3.  You suffer without that pet for 33 levels.  You get your puppy, and love having him.  You get your next pup, less usefull, you get your 3rd pup at 44, even less useful and the trend goes on to where your last pet is only usefull to clean up low greens to raise faction fast.  Much bigger let down, let down number 3.<BR>4.  These were about on par though level 29, then something happened, we stoped getting healing spells until in to the 50+ arena.  There is such a huge drop between 1st and 2nd rank healers that this is let down number 4.  Just a small let down, but yet another one.<BR>5.  Debuffs.  You find out that your cripple line really is only good for PvP, and you dont want to do PvP at all.  You slow line is the saving grace of the class that looked so cool when you started out, and the initial look, this area was a couple of minor lines of spells.  You Malo line gets resisted so much its not to great either.  Well this one is ok, saved by the slow line and lower expectations.<BR>6.  As you play the game you realize that your stat buffs dont do much, you have lessor haste abilities than enchanters, lessor AC/HP buffs than Clerics.  The greatest disapointment of all.<P>You may say why dont you play something else.<P>If VI would let me transfer my Experience to another class I would do it today.<P>I dont want to give up the 30+ days of play time I have on my Troll Shaman.  I have been playing for more than a year to get that many hours in, its basically 85% of my PC game time for over a year.  I have no desire to start over.  a higher level charcter (of any class) beats a newbie again.<P>I still love the vision of a shaman.  I love the idea of healing buffing, and helping out in a few other areas in a pinch.  Thats why I chose the class.<P>The reality is I slow down mobs.  That is what I do.  In a pinch I can not fill in for any other roll at higher levels.  I want to do more than slow down mobs.<P>Please, Please, Please add stat buffs to the list, look at them, add a proc or static effect to make them worthwhile.  Make us the "King of Buffs" like our spell list looks like we are.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'd like to say I'm very pleased with changes so far and appreciate the effort in making this a great game for all.<P>Here's my feedback.  Diving right in,<P>The need for Something Special: we need a class-defining, community-centered spell, something that others desire.  Enchanters give clarity, clerics can res, druids and wizards can teleport, necros give DMF and can summon corpse, mages can Call-of-Hero.  SOW fills this role for us at the early levels but then quickly becomes as common as Iron Rations on food vendors.  Perhaps add Spirit Essence, a long-lasting SOW and lev combo (and maybe with a neat semi-transparant look).  Perhaps alchemy (if fixed) can help fill this role.<P>Scale of Wolf: Make it faster.  Why?  Because right now the 15% difference between it and regular SOW is not enough to make up for the time and effort it takes to mem and cast, recast when some other buff (e.g. lev or invis) fades or if we stop to SOW others we meet along the way, and finally re-mem regular SOW and re-cast it at our destination.  I'm not thinking bard-speed here, just an increase over regular SOW that's comparable to the increase Jboots give our non-SOWed friends.<P>Scale of Wolf: Fix it so it only drops when you try to cast or attack.  Right now it also drops when a mob casts upon you, and I feel it should not (unless they're casting dispell)<P>Malaise line: (echoed many times in this thread) either make it much less resistable, or have it check something other than magic resist (disease is a good one).  Why?  To get around the "I need to land Malaise before I can land Malaise chicken-and-egg problem".<P>Pox, Bane of Nife, Tigir's: spell-drops too rare.  Possibly look at damage:mana raition, currently only 25% better than chain-nuking.<BR> <BR>Rage line:  I like the way it's working now.<P>Healing: I love the changes so far!  Chloroblast has been a lifesaver (ask the enchanter I group with  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  I think SH would fit better at 49 or 44 given the healing-spells progression up to the 30's, but the reduced fizzle rate and chloroblast has solved the biggest problems.  (Thank you!)  Whatever you do, I feel that druids and shamen should be very similar in healing power, and wonder why druids get a big heal at 60 and shamen don't.<P>Pet: I like the changes that have been made, particularly the reduction in mana cost.  However it seems to only hit as hard as the 49-pet now, and not sure if this is a bug, bad casting luck, or as intended.  I'd like to see the pet be a little stronger.  Perhaps make it so you have greater chance of summoning the top pet as you level up.  Also, give pet SOW as an innate ability.<P>Stat buffs: make group versions have same effect as the top single version.<P>On stat buffs in general: There's been many a cry to make stats mean something. While I too would like to see the effects of buffing become greater, consider that they need to become better at the expense of *something*.  The game has been set up for melee at around their current effectiveness.  If each buff were to become 10% more effective, a fully buffed melee-type would be 40% more effective than they are now and that might lead to more balance problems than it solves.  On the other hand, if you reduce the baseline 20% so the balance swings 20% in each direction, you'll have the melee classes screaming "NERF!".  Perhaps the reason the buff question has not been addressed yet might be because it's a very complicated issue, and not that they dont care about us.<P>Anyway, that's my 2cp for now,<P>Qali - 59 Shaman of Test<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 8 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000396-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000396.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000396-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000396-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000396-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000396-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000396-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000396-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum14&number=14&thisthread=000396&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum14&number=14&thisthread=000396&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
