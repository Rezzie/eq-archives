Speaking as a Test player-<BR>FEIGN DEATH IS, REPEAT IS, BEING TINKERED WITH.<BR>Further, the refresh time IS, REPEAT IS, the subject of that tinker- although I don't play a monk on Test (my monk is on Povar, and yes he feign pulls, thanks) I've heard a LOT of howling from the Test monk community lately; seems at one point whatever they did to fiddle with feign didn't work, and broke it altogether. This, obviously, didn't last long, but longer refresh times seem to be the least of our worries- although the Test Monks have reported plenty of those as well.<P>There you go, A- you've been 'let know.' The test monks are crying into their ale mugs right now. Sorry I can't give you exact numbers, but since they're probably changing patch by patch anyhow.<P>ThePizzaGuy<BR>(Who wonders why the realism of Feign Pulling is a problem, but the realism of silly things like  gnome warriors who can stun-bash things four times greater in sizeis never called into question.

</FONT><HR>I find the idea of a rogue being a better puller completely.... insane.  If you are dealing with a broken spawn anyone that has the diligence and skill to learn, <BR>1) mana costs for all the casters classes so that you do not have to do a mana check every 5 seconds.  <BR>2) the ability to count the casts of your casters while in combat <BR>3) the diligence to learn the effects a given line of heals not one on your self but on ever other possible "tank" class you will be working with. <BR>4) the ability to guide a group into realizing that peeking that corner is the stupidest possible move they could do.  <BR>5) the patience to learn the argo ranges and pathing of every mob you plan on pulling.  <BR>6) the actual time that it will take a group of varied composition to kill said critter <BR>7) having that nagging timing clock in the back of your head that tells you when you have to lay off a pull because there is a another about to happen.<P>now throw into this that there are 3 options to most pullers if something goes  wrong.  1) Die.  Save your group, guard their live with your own.  That is the most frequent option that any true puller will take.  You die so that they might live.  2) Train you group and hope they can take it.  3) Train zone and hope you make it out alive 4) try to scrape your train off on someone else group or puller.<P>Options 2 through 4 sucks.  Even optoin 1 does.<P>Monks have another option ( SK's do too, but the ability to employ it limited ).  FD, Life still be able to keep your pull cycle going with limited interuptions.  THAT is why monks are better pullers.  They spend more time doing it and less time running back to a corpse. <P>Feign Breaks,  you can't mez everything in EQ.  This just adds to it.  I actually almost never FD after I have broken an area for pulling.<P>As to catagorizing monks as unable to tank....  I really hope you are talking post 50.  If not maybe you should start asking your monks what their AC vs that of the warriors your working with.  The awnser might shock you.  In most cases under 50 the monks AC is better then the warriors or VERY close.  I find you limited view of this class quite humerious.  My 37th level monk has about 20 - 30 less AC then my 43rd level SK does.  My monk has several more skill improvements, my SK capped 3 levels ago.  The increases in AC from the skill improvements over the next 6 levels will easily put my SK over my sk's best self buffed AC.<P>Autumn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Good point, At least when a monk pulls, if he gets too meny he can feign and they'll go home. Anyone else has to train their party and get them killed or train to zone and get evryone killed. Because monks have used the feign pull, many lives have been spared. <P>*builds an statue in honor of the first monk to create the technique*<P>Ryogax Hibikix <BR>Monk of the 43rd Fist<BR>"Beware The Black Fisted Ninja Strikes Again!"<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I haven't done one of these in a while.<P>/rant on<P>Actually It's not a monks AC thats much of an issue. It's our lower than caster HP. I've found that only enchanters.  I've found hybrids, shamans, druids, warriors, rogues have more hp than us monks. Which is fine, and our AC is comparable to these classes (prior to Kunark) I saw a bracer for a shaman with 19 ac and a 265 dmg DD on it. What do we get, you ask?  3 ac sleeves whoopie! (crescent) Even warriors are getting armor with effects on them. We get one weapon with the effect major shielding on it, but it weighs 10 stones so that just barely makes up for the ac we lose for being over our weight limit post 50 apparently our fists are not the best damage dealers in the game so we have to start using weapons, well any weapons that are worth using are too heavy and causes us to lose even more AC. Coupled with our low HP we are less effective in combat. <P>Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm getting the feeling that we got shafted in the expansion.  We are no longer the "masters of meelee" as our damage output is lower and to increase our damage we have to sacrifice precious AC.  Not to mention the fact that we've been cursed from the beginning with the weight limit as we are the poorest class in Norrath, as we can never loot anything. (God all the FS I've passed up over the years) get a tink bag you say? haha they're 5000+ pp and us being poor it's near impossible to get that much cash, unless you have rich friends =P<P>/rant off<P>-Ryo<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I'm not sure why I'm bothering, but I am.<P>I have been reading this board for quite a while. I usually lurk. I very rarely post. Usually only on things that really intrest me.<P>This FD thing has really got me going.<P>Here's the timeline for the last few weeks/months.<P>Abashi makes a statement that he disapproves of FD pulling.<P>Monks go ape****. Sure that a nerf is underway (justifiable, IMO).<P>Over a month of pleas, requests, threats and other stuff trying to get Abashi to not change FD.<BR>During this time, the 'propsed nerf' becomes a 'definate nerf' in people's minds.<P>Then, on test, someone decides that it is taking longer to refresh FD. They are so definate that it is taking longer that they tell two friends, and they tell two friends, and so on.<P>Abashi tests FD. With a monk. To make sure that it is still working properly. When he releases the results, people start asking if he did it in this way, or that way. Never satisfied that he actually tested it the 'way it is supposed to be tested.' He answers every question with Yes, we did that, there was no change. It soon becomes apparant that the monks will not be satisfied that he tested it, even if he came to their houses and showed them the test on their own system.<P>Abashi then asks for ANYONE to come forward from test with the supposed nerf. No one, not one person, comes forth. Abashi also states that there are NO plans currently in the works to change FD.<P>Now it starts again. Someone heard something. FD is going to be nerfed. Someone knows someone who knows someone who heard about someone on test who verified the problem, but doesn't have the stats on hand. But it's true, true I tell you!<P>People, get a grip. Two things:<P>1) If you think that FD is in the process of being nerfed, check it out yourself. Create a Monk on Test. Get him up to FD level and break out a stopwatch.<P>2) Why do you ask Abashi questions? To get an answer, right? And what do you do with the answer? Immediately dismiss it. He is lying, wrong, misinformed, tested it wrong, used the wrong class, or is under mind control from aliens. If that is going to be your reaction to his answer, whatever his answer is, then WHY ASK THE QUESTION IN THE FIRST PLACE?<P>Geez.<P>BTW, this is in no way meant to dismiss the issue. FD pulling is essential to what a Monk is. Taking this away, would turn a very viable class, into a second rate warrior. However, it is not currently being change and not in the planning to be changed. However, I will tell you this much from my experience in RL. You want something to stay pure, unchanged, unaltered then STOP FOCUSING THE SPOTLIGHT ON IT. If FD is currently okay, granted not like it once was before the previous 2 nerfs of it, then stop, just stop. Otherwise you are inviting that which you most fear.<P>Kneebiter Wordsmith, Gnome Warrior of E'ci.<BR>(wondering who the first person will be to flame him because his is NOT a monk)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

FD seems about as natural as you get given the abilities as they are:<P>Mobs aggro and chase you...you PRETEND...TO...BE...DEAD...mobs sniff around, usually believe you are and walk away...you wait until they are out of normal range to still see you stand up and you no longer...PRETEND...TO...BE...DEAD.<P>How does that concept remotely sound like some special consideration or exception is being employed? Nerfing it is what is unnatural.<P>If Verant would simply stop changing things around every time the player community adapts and creatively uses their given abilities, Norrath would have been a much more stable and fun place lately. Interesting combinations and uses of skills is part of RL as well, how can that not be considered a desireable thing?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I play a Monk on a Live Server and today I got a very strange message I never had before:<P>You must wait longer before you can feign death (client warning)<P>That scared me a lot. I am not 100% of the conditions that made this text appears but I think I did a First feign and stayed down and, as the mob went on hitting me, I tried to do another FD. At that time I got the message.<P>By the way It seems to me that FD works a lot better when I am not in a group. In solo, doing a success full FD and having the MOB still hiiting me is very rare. But,in a group, beeing killed by a MOB after 3 or More sucessfull FD is far to be uncommun. A way to avoid FD Pull?<P>To close this post (too long as usual :P) I don't know how it's possible to play this game without FD. the "Die or Zone" routine that you have to follow if you encounter anything, and I mean anything, that can kill you, seems just to weird for me.<P>Szlia Southpaw<BR>Lanys</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
