</FONT><HR>OK, just to add my input to this,<P>1) Fix tracking - nuf' said<P>2) Improve/fix archery....  I'll take any of the veriant developers out to a archery range, with my bows, and show them I can easily hit something above or below me.  Damage done at all levels needs to be looked at.  We have some decent equipment that's ranger only, give us some really good equipment to make us drool.   Also, arrow recovery, when we shoot 100pp worth of equipment at a mob, I'd like to think about getting part of it back.  Make it a new skill, or just have them show up in loot, like an item given to a mob.<P>3) Spells.... the current changes are good, hopefuly all the changes on the test server will make it to the live servers.  I'd like to see lowering the levels we get some of the healing spells.  SoW at 30?  Would be nice, but not needed for balance, for sure.<P>4) Defence.   ANYTHING that helps us take less damage, by whatever means, without turning us into a tank (which we're not) is good.  Alot of rangers need to work on when to use their taunt skills, and when not to.  My ranger is only at 26, but I already see the taunt value my spells and attacks have.  Warrior taking too much damage, and the cleric's OOM?  Cast a snare, the mob will notice you fast.  But without a doubt, anything you do to  lower the damage rangers take is good.<P>5) Pets.  Seen request for this, don't bother, we dont' need it.  Unless you give us something with a high roleplay value, no pet.<P>6) ports and such.  Don't need them, shouldn't have them.  <P>7) Binds.  I beleive there should be a high-level (50+) spell for Self binds, limited to the same areas the melee classes can be bound now.  This spell should be avaliable to all hybreds.  But no regular bind.<P>8) FIX tracking... oh, did I say this already... very, very important.<P>9) Archery... also worth repeating<P>Motafrancis Sicnarfatom<BR>26th level half-elf ranger<BR>Circle of Veeshan, Veeshan Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>lol guys. I *love* the thought of Indoor harmony. But to be honest, we would become gods. period. Thats why we don't have it yet. In Seb you could pull solo's through-out the entire dungeon. Awesome? Yes. Going to happen? Not bloody likely.<BR>To all those requesting that we lose Jolt and/or taunt button, that is... unwise  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> Jolt serves the purpose *WHEN* it is not resisted. And MY taunt button has saved quite a few casters and priests, don't know about you guys  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>I do feel that if all hybrids have X number of points distributed among their skills in Offense/Defense, they should all have the same X number. Regardless if it is 20% Offense 80% Defense or vice versa. I dont deem it necessary for Knight Classes to have X and for Rangers to have X-20 (20 is an example, the number was quoted a lot in the previous posts, though I dont recall off hand) It seems we have quite a few unused points laying around, and I dont think ANY member of ANY class can and will object to us recieving those points, as I feel, they are due us.<BR>At any rate, thanks for scrolling by yet another post  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>-tekk trailblazin<BR>-Outrider of the "Black Tower"<BR>-Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Greetings,<P>I have actually sat down and tried to read all of these posts and I have failed miserably.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>I am going to weigh in with a few opinions since most everyone else has.<P>VI has decided that we are "Offense" oriented hybrids.  Cool, I actually relish that.  Make me deadly.  I have no problem with that at all.<P>The problem lies in the simple fact that, regardless of my lethality, I am a paper tiger.  It can all be summed up with the word "SURVIVEABLITY".<P>Basically, in higher level encounters, we have real problems surviving.  I am not advocating a massive defensive upgrade.  I am not even asking you to make me solo-able.  I would, however, ask for a bit of a bump in the survivability category.<P>More HP<BR>Make us avoid more damage<BR>Lower Jolt to 49 or 51 and lower the resist<P>These, along with the weapon skills and spells on test and the upcoming changes to Track and I will be fat dumb and happy.<P>Keene Brightblades<BR>Pathfinder<BR>Quelliuos<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wow, ok ill make this fast because its already page 15:<P>1) Raise our Defense Caps post 50 to equal the Offense caps the Sk/Pals get.  Obviously verant was wise enough to see that a Minor increase in offense is needed for paladins, im sure they can see a Minor defense increase is needed as well.<P>2) Bows.  Can you make my Raincaller/Wind Sabre look different than a 5cp bow bought off a merchant?  There should also be a higher Variety of Ranger only Bows.<P>3) Remove Firestrike and put in a cold spell similar to Call of Flames, with a level 60 upgrade similar to Calefaction.  We arent meant to be nukers, high dmg long cast spells see little or no use.<P>4) Eyes of the Cat.  Maybe you should rename this spell to the "Human Rangers Only" spell.  The ultravision spell gained at level 56 should replace eyes of the cat and at level 56 we should gain either Self only or targetable See Invis.<P>5) Archery.  Should max out at 252, and be the only class that does.<P>6) Tracking.  I recall something about a scroll bar and filters on tracking, are these still being implemented?  Also need a transparent overlay of the Tracking box so that it doesnt constantly switch back to 640*480 resolution when playing in full screen.<P>7) an upgrade to Feet Like Cat would be nice.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Based on what I've read since my last post (see Part 1), I have a few more comments:<P>Panic Animal:  Inappropriate, even though some animals (cats) do attack us.  Let the SKs do the fear kiting.<P>Enhanced Harmony:  Again, no.  That's the enchanter's job - we're masters of the OUTDOORS.<P>Disarm:  Useless at our maximum skill level.  Better to give us Safe Fall at same skill level as bards.<P>Karana:  I agree that there should be specific quests for rangers who worship Karana.  Time to add another plane perhaps?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Eye of the Cat:  Adding the See Invisible component to this is a good idea.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Okay here is what I think:<P>1. Move the Jolt spell to level 51 and make it less resistable. Rangers have huge taunt problems once they get into their high 40's. Or instead of this, just give rangers the evade skill like rogues have.<P>2. Please make archery more useful. Right not its not good for much. A lot of people spend a lot of money to become master fletchers. Guess what they get for it. The ability to make bows that will hardly ever be used.<P>3. It would be nice to get some animal charming spells. Rangers live in the outdoors and are the protectors of animals. They should be able to charm green-con animals like druids.<P>Thats pretty much all that I think needs to be done. The first one is the most important one, and the other two are just things that would be very nice role-play wise.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, to add my voice to the masses, I'll try not to rehash what's already been said; too much  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>First and formost, the absolute most important and necessary balance issue for rangers is the graphic for plate helms on wood elf females.  I can never get a group because of how the tolans helm looks.  I can't tank well because of it.  My hitpoints disappear more quickly when i wear it.  And my spells fizzle at least 300% more often as well.  Even sow is slower when i cast it while wearing a platemail helm.  Please change this... (OK.. hehe.. that's my idea of a joke-although i would like to see it changed--tell me how they get their ears in there? that's gotta hurt-hehehe)   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Seriously though, I agree with those who have posted that defense needs to be increased.  I have a shaman friend who is lower level than I who has more AC than my ranger.  This just doesn't seem balanced to me at all.  I'd rather have the needed increase in defense over the increase in offense.  If the ranger is supposed to be so light and agile, (which a low AC implies), then we should be able to dodge, parry, riposte, evade, block, and basically just get out of the way of an attack much more easily than any player in full platemail.  Either defense needs to be increased or the sub-defensive skills need to be dramatically improved.<P>Second, and this is not necessarily Ranger specific, but does affect rangers to a large extent.  And, since these threads address game balance as a whole, and I believe that to have that balance, the players need at least some semblance of order and peace, I think this needs to be addressed.  Venril Sathir.  Here is a spawn that carries not only class specific greaves that until Velious' release were the definitive legwear for each class, but now also drops 3 classes epic quest components.  This is a source of much too much animosity and strife between many guilds and players.  This is just way too much important loot to drop off of one mob.  Every patch day, the race to get there first is sickening.  The arguments that follow leave more of a sense of anguish than of accomplishment from slaying this single epic MOB.<P>I can think of many ways this could be addressed, and I'm sure so could many others.  One method that sounds very reasonable to me though, is to remove the epic components from VS and move them to a triggered spawn.  Similar to the cleric quest and Ragefire in Solusek B, I think it would be nice to see one version of Venril Sathir spawn on the existing timetable, and then have a similar MOB, (same difficulty and even name if desired), triggered by completing part of each classes quest.  The slaying of this "triggered" Venril Sathir would only drop the epic component for the class which triggered the spawn.  Similar to Ragefire in SolB, this spawn could only be triggered after the orignal MOB was killed (have to kill Nagafen and wait for the NPC to spawn 1-3days later).  This I think would alleviate the overwhelming agony involved with tackling this epic mob without reducing the difficulty of the encounter.  <P>In the case of the rangers quest, you could even move Foloal Stormforest into Karnors, (she would spawn some time after the last VS slaying), and make her invisible, like a scout searching for information about VS.  Turn in one of the quest components to her in Karnors and then VS would spawn holding only the ranger stone.  (Not sure if the druid quest follows the same story-line up to this point still--but either way, druids and wizards could do something similar to get VS with their epic required item).<P>Overall, I think the rangers are a strong class, with many under-appreciated abilities, lacking only in the defensive areas (and this is a serious lack).  The epic issue affects only higher level rangers close to completing their epic, but still is a source of disharmony for the entire high level player base and should be addressed.<P>Wyynd StormBrynger, Emef`Aitch<BR>The Rathe<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>actually7 speardancer at 26 i don't think you have any idea what we need and what we don't need.Not to be rude of course but seriously ports(mainly evacs) and pets are something that would make us viable. Evacs could give us a reason to be in groups. Pets would increase our damage out put and maybe give someone that can taunt off of us. below 40 rangers have no issues really. you can solo right now. You don't know what we need and what we don't post 40 so don't tell us. I think i sound like a jerk,i know i sound like a jerk.

</FONT><HR>My first post and couldn't let this one go by  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>From my experience of playing this game for over a year and a half I have a level 49 ranger that has an gosh awful amount of /played(only know of 2 players with higher than me). Anyways my suggestion is that if rangers could get a heal sooner. It has been that we are always behind the curve on healing or damage.<P>I'll explain some. I'm a ranger that doesn't use arch. I for one think that it could get me into a lot of troubles if not trains. This is just me. there are quite a few folks that go from playing rangers to being clerics. Yes they got the exp by being good clerics from being their rangers and told their heals aren't good enough or when they try to help by healing someone they get laughed at.<P>its my belief that rangers should get a heal between 39 and 57. by the time we get the heals others classes has much better heals than us. When I group the first thing I look for is a warrior, the second thing I look for is who is the healer.<P>so my thoughts are if we could get a better heal some where between 39 and 57.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>On the Evac Issue<P>True evacs and gates are the realm of True Casters and true priest types.  I say we leave em there.  My opinion.<P>However, one thought for a evac type spell would be pack cheetah - perhaps a 10 sec Cheetah speed spell - It would overwrite SOW/wolfform and give cheetah speed - sufficient for everyone to run.  THat is what we do - Use our feet when needed.  However - you can see the downside of running using this.<P>I must also state that I do not agree with significant spell additions.  Perhaps reshuffling the ones we have and getting one or two more of our parent class line at higher lvls - I can accept.<P>Dyarrig Lawne</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>First of all since this is buried deep behind my brothers and sisters of the woods' excellent points...I will simply state that the changes on test are FANTASTIC for those lower level rangers who have not finished thier level process yet. It is wonderful to see the additions except<BR>panic animal. NO WAY PLEASE I do NOT want to have rangers being necro-druid clones twinked over and over and over. PLEASE REMOVE THE FEAR hehe...useless at high level game, not in my vision of a ranger...call that bear to help you? Heck yes! Make that bear run away from you..the one you just hand fed some rabbit meat...um...no. The only thing this spell will do is allow lower level rangers to fear kite in the open/solo better for the levels where they are *gasp* already very very good..they were good when *I* was 24th level..in ringmail from unrest, my savants cap for wisdom, a jagged band from a 3 group raid on the ghost, and my prized well balanced 2handed axe. <P>Heh, that said, I want to get to my point. Like Sean, Xantha, Tullain, Tanthalar, Zeyk, Elderan, I was one of the first level 60 rangers on my server. I hit level 60 on E'ci on October 17th. I have respectable gear, (full tolans, ac 1040 yadda yadda) long history of playing many classes (59 enchanter as my secondary), and the majority of my time in game is helping others level up, doing large scale raids (epics, trak, vs, dain, yelinak, Veeshans peak etc) or questing for little things (giant quests, ludicrous stormfeather waiting for days, etc). For the leveling rangers, the test server changes are very VERY beneficial. The additional spells will help those who are not level 60 get there THAT much quicker..along with the xp penalty lift, leveling to 60 wont be that bad. Also, with the snare/root stacking, in XP GROUPS ONLY, aggro control is very VERY manageable, or your ranger is not being played right. If you get hit, snare, root, back up as far away while still in melee range=damage still, not getting hit. However, at the high level game, rangers will not see any change at all other than perhaps a slightly increased melee offense.<P>Endure/resist cold will not be used in raids. Druids offer much better resist spells.<BR>Skin like Nature is a soloing tool only. Not for grouping/raids etc where heroism is used (same for paladins reso etc, although shield of words from a apaladin is almost always used)<BR>Firefist doesnt stack with strength of nature...but thats as it should be..str of nature is an upgrade..and high level rangers cant afford the buff slot as it is.<BR>Spikecoat will help the lower level rangers! KUDOS. However being a warder, I have thorncoat..the superior buff..and this wont affect us at all.<BR>Panic animal should not be implemented at all, unless you feel that the folks who quit thier rangers are coming back to play thier kewldood necro melee clones..and you don't have enough rangers in eq.<BR>Offense/wep skills raised. This will help the high level ranger deal more damage. Raid wise it will help somewhat...but thats a double edged sword because both jolt and root do not work on raids, and as such the taunt of the epic proc will surely aggro on us even more as Nerfshot is pointless if you have epics for damage output.<P>As you can see, the proposed changes WILL make an impact on the lower level rangers..but the high level game will see little to no improvements.<P>My brethren have proposed a few things to help rangers achieve parity with the other melee classes in desirability for raiding/grouping for xp. Let me expound on them a bit, and share some things in these 2 threads that have been overlooked.<P>THE LIST IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE<P>Hitpoint disparity:<BR>Yes, I am sure you hear from EVERY class that they want more hitpoints, but in the ranger's case it is very evident an adjustment needs to take place.<BR>-------History of hp balance<BR>When I first started EQ, rangers had the same unbuffed hp (with equivalent stamina/hp items) as paladins, and sks. Rogues and Monks both had VERY SLIGHTLY less. Warriors had the same as well. Warriors got fixed (they needed it badly...now warriors are the epitome of tank. /who warrior all on any server compared to /who all anyhybridnamehere. DO NOT NERF WARRIORS WE NEED THEM STRONG). <BR>Paladins and shadowknights received a large hp increase before Kunark came out because ivy etched quests (ranger ruby replacement armor) were slightly easier to finish, and also had the same ac as rubicite...so did the rest of the class armors. As a result of this, coupled with the fact that rangers without ruby all banded together on the Glade, www.eqforge.com/ranger, to find out that ac was all that mattered with hp in absorbing damage. Rangers had just slightly less or equal ac to paladins/sk at MID LEVEL and thus could tank equally well with the "ivy twink" armor. Add to this that paladins/sks never had to fight for armor class..so they went with "prom jewelry" aka non ac stat increasing items instead of real rings/necklaces/bracers/earrings that added ac...so more rangers actually OUTTANKED pal/sks out of simple all/all item usage. However, rangers with full planar armor vs. a paladin/sk in full planar armor were still outtanked by a decent margin. <BR>This imbalance needs to be equalled out now with the huge ac difference in armors in Kunark and Velious. Add 200 hp for this.<BR>-------Equipment hp modifiers<BR>Rangers are damage dealers, they are to be classified with Monks and rogues in the new Verant vision. However, even compared with hybrids, currently in the best hp/ac configuration fully dressed rangers will have substantially less UNBUFFED hp than any Paladin, Shadowknight, Monk, or Rogue. Ironically, buffed, even some bards have more hp, along with Shamen, Shadowknights, Paladins, Monks, and Rogues. Naked, rangers will have slightly more than monks and rogues. Why? Add 200 hp for this in stamina and HP on class armors?<BR>-------conclusion, high level game insight<BR>Hitpoints are what distinguishes a melee class in raids. Even though rangers are not meant to tank, and properly played in EXP groups they shouldn't get hit much, rangers on raids will always be succeptible to area effect weapons from ubermobs, and WILL tank versus anything immune to magic based spells. Anyone who has fought Hoshkar or Trakanon KNOWS that hitpoints matter the most in survivability versus them along with resistances...Even though rangers shouldn't tank in exp groups for long (we can't as well as just about any melee, or bard, or cleric even), we have a taunt button and use our aggro control to protect the few classes that have less ac hp than we do, or need to have the ability to cast uninterrupted. Rangers have had to evolve from a secondary tank to less of one than a rogue..a specialty class. Many have quit and leveled rogues or warriors already, many just play badly and give us a bad name, but those of us who ARE still playing to the best of our abilities want to have increased survivability..not necessarily ac or defense...but the means to be an asset..a damage dealer. We need to have more hitpoints...or remove taunt from our ability list. <P>Defense issue:<BR>Rangers want parity in skill points. Our triple whammy of low hitpoints/level 40 defense cap/low AC armor is very difficult to overcome. When we typed in the name of our ranger and went to the home point screen, ALL of us knew we were going to have lesser ac ITEMS available to us, in exchange for dual wield. This is a staple of EQ, I do NOT want to see store bought plate on rangers..nor do I wish to see class specific armor sets with equivalent ac to paladins, shadowknights, bards, and clerics. I do not expect to surpass the armor class of a well equipped high level Monk either. I do not even expect to see us with higher ac than rogues unbuffed either, as they have supreme avoidance and the same armor class on class armors as us. Rogues and Monks SHOULD be hard to hit..greasy little devils and highly trained combatants one with mind and body will always avoid attacks/absorb strikes better. However..rangers wear light armor for a reason..we should be able to get the heck out of the way/counterattack better than an ogre shadowknight, and should absorb damage better than a shaman or monk. What we need is parity in skill caps.<BR>--------220 defense should be sufficcient for our class to raise the bar slightly for ac, along with perhaps some increases to reposte and dodge. Paladins and Shadowknights will ALWAYS have higher ac ITEMS, and will still surpass us in defenseive skills. We don't need that much in this department..but a little balance in skill points goes a long way.<P>High level spells:<BR>Rangers are half as durable, and don't deal as much damage as a monk, rogue or warrior for sustained periods of time. For this we have spells, VI tells us..only the utility of the limited spells we do have is lesser than what the other classes will bring to a level 60 raid or group. Rangers are supposed to suppliment thier melee with damage spells, right now we have ONE that is worth the time it takes to cast with epic weapons for damage in a period of time, and we can't use it more than once every 45 seconds. Add to this that it's mana cost is so high it drains us completely after a few short bursts..and mana recovery for ALL hybrids/meditate is capped so low it often takes us longer to meditate to full with 150 wisdom (all wisdom gear mind you..prom jewelry for wis gear hehe) than the level 60 druid next to me with 200 wis plus mana items. Because of this, spells are almost always used for utility only..while the damage aspect of our spells is only used sporadically.<BR>------Solution, replace root at 60 with either Ice, a 350 damage hopefully cold/magic save version of call of flame, or drifting death. Raise all hybrid meditate caps to 245.<P>Archery/Trueshot: Yes it would be loveley to deal some more damage/use this skill. What would be even more loveley however is if you would fix the bugs of line of sight/too high/too low messages. If you refuse to change the way bow damages work, then at least look into giving rangers the ability to double attack with bows at level 60..like warriors triple attack. If you fix the to hit modifier in Trueshot, and put SOME SORT of minimum damage in..heck even like 75 minimum damage at level 60, with double attack at 60 trueshot would be worth giving away my get out of jail free trick on raids (weaponshield) when stuff inviteably aggros on me. Please give it a look. There are other things that would help out archery tons..but really you guys are seeking balance right now...and archery hasn't been worth having a bow in your range slot ever..don't see that changing now that I have an idol of the thorned. <BR>-------Solution: Double attack with bows at level 60. Minimum damage equal to half the equipped bow's damage, or one quarter the level of the ranger...effective at level 51. Fix the to-hit ratio of trueshot discipline to 85 percent.<P>Tracking: <BR>Rowyl says it's coming...I wait patiently for a scrollbar thats ranger only <P>Jolt/evade:<BR>Jolt needs to cost 75 mana and be like tash. Or rangers need evade skill. On dragons I am cut down quicker than Clinton was by Hillary after the Lewinsky incident when I aggro bosses.<P>Ranger only skill:<BR>I was kind of hoping for a once per day outdoor bind, a "make camp" skill, or a once per day outdoor-only animal-only fixed duration/non aggro upon release charm (obviously for roleplay mostly..level limit it to like 3/4 the level of the ranger?) Heh course enchanters should have a spell that charms for 4 minutes at 60 too, but really if the above is even implemented partially..rangers will still be balanced...and the tracking changes will hopefully be ranger-biased.<P>Things not to do:<BR>NO INDOOR HARMONY. Man as cool as it sounds, it would make things like Dain raids, corpse recoveries, things that are supposed to be hard simply retarded...unless this is a once per day thing like lay hands/harm touch I couldn't see it..and still it would have to have a level limit or monks would be out of a job on uberraids.<P>NO FEAR OF ANY KIND. I really dont want every necro/druid k3wl L33T deWD starting a ranger. Most of us that are still around are here because we love the roleplay aspect, and the general feel of the class..not the power /chuckle as its obviously not there. Please don't cheapen our class with a cheesey fear kite tactic ability.<P>DON'T GIVE US 'ENHANCEMENTS' TO HITPOINTS IN THE FORM OF UNSTACKABLE BUFFS. I have 11 self buffs, many of which I can't use on raids as it is. Make the CLASS better, not the buff selection. How am I supposed to get all my self buffs when I have Aegeolism (clr hero/aegis/symbol buff), Focus (shm str/dex/kragg), Group resist magic, Resist X (depending on said ubermob), Haste of some sort (usually VoGrandeur or SotShissar), Dragonborn hammer buff(veeshans peak hammer), RuneV, Divine Strength (paly 60 buff) and then I want to buff Thorncoat, Call of Earth (if I have room..which I never do since SOTS and COE don't stack) Str of Nature (though it doesnt stack with pally buff I am there for damage right?) Chloroplast, Predator, Chill sight so I can freakin see, Greater wolf form in Veeshans peak, Garou/call of sky (since call of fire doesnt interrupt ubers...its a joke fix it or sumn, too weak of a spell for the level) and have room for celestial healing? This is with all the "slot saver" buffs..what if one of our level 60 clerics/shamen doesn't show up? I am always full on buff slots....what If I need DMF or levi? <P>DON'T NERF ANYONE. I swear I was so upset when you destroyed my Mistwalker. Then I was again frustrated after the Nerfshot patch. I have watched you turn necromancers into buffers/manastones on raids, turn Cleric breastplates from fantastic utilities to wall decorations, and worst of all saw my class go from a light secondary tank to a pantywaist with that "taunt" skill right alongside with "disarm" never even hotkeyed. (2 ensnare/flamelick=not happy monster) I love my ranger, I tried another class, I came back to finish what I started. Please PLEASE look at all the class threads and fix it so every class has SOMETHING TO CONTRIBUTE OTHER THAN BUFFS on raids, at the high level game. If they are meleers let them do thier job. <P>Even highly skilled rangers die every single night on raids earlier than they should because of the lack of insight about aggroing mob code and lack of foresight on epic encounters concerning the survivability of the ranger class. Please take a long look at what folks are saying here. Don't nerf anyone...but enhance folks until there is a balance in the classes once and for all. <P><BR> <BR>Ce1t<BR>Station Member   posted 02-06-2001 02:10 PM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>NOOO they split the thread while I was posting...I'm sorry should I move this to ranger talk?

</FONT><HR>I have one suggestion that would make rangers very wanted in groups. An EVADE skill built into hide (similar to a rogue) for pulling! And I'm talking about an evade that wipes the hate list clean. Who pulls in most groups? The monk? Rangers are awsome pullers in outdoors and I'm pretty good indoors too. But think about what we could do if we could evade off adds when pulling for a group? My regular group wants me along all the time because they know that they will not get trained when I'm pulling. I realy don't think that this would be overpowering. I think that it would really add to the skills that we bring to a group. <P>Tmaass Aerrosmith<BR>36th ranger of E'ci</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok Ranger.. as its been said before by my fellow rangers they are thought of in MOST fantasy roles or games *except EQ* as agile nimble fighters that use the fact they don't wear plate as an advantage to avoid hits my DODGING them or simply moving out of the way.  Hence I have a couple of suggestions for this.<P>DEFENSIVE SUGGESTIONS<P>First, yes we could say we have an *avoid being hit* skill such as evade.. call it deftness call it combat agility etc.. that would be a great idea since we already have the Hide ability.. BUT this could cause problems with Rogues... <P>Second, we could say that due to the fact that we ARENT WEARING PLATE hence we move Easier our AGILITY points count towards AC or defense more so than any other class.. *hmmm making rangers an AGILITY BASED CLASS.. makes sense to me*.. most of the time rangers are the class that worry about agility more than any other class because of our AC problem.<P>Third, we could also say that rangers have a fighting focus.. in which when engaged in combat they get SKILL CHECKS .. pretty much as AC/DOGE/PARRY checks are made except we would have a check NOT POSSIBLE BY PLATE WEARING CLASSES .. such as EVADE!!  or TUMBLE? having an extra skill such as the deftness previously mentioned makes a lotof sense to me..<P>OFFENSIVE SUGGESTIONS<P>I am unfortunately gonna have to be consistent with my perseption of the ranger.. higher offense sounds right.. BUT.. there are reasons for this.  Again in most Fantasy settings the reason a ranger deals an ungodly amount of damage is because of FINESS.. yes finess not because of STR.. in a situation where a warrior and a ranger are facing a foe in FULL PLATE the warrior will use his strenght to simply break through the plate armor trying to achieve critical hits and break through the AC of a monster... but rangers are different.. a ranger would have such knowledge of his weapons that he would instead find a crack or an open sliver in the armor to strike with his weapons perhaps delivering a blow to an artery hence the damage perce not being HUGE but now the ranger has wounded this creature to a point where it would most likekly die.. while the warrior is still bashing away.. Also rangers being the defenders of their lands in MOST fantasy settings have a HATED enemy in which case the get an array of combat bonuses depending on the level and even in some cases which HATEd enemy they are facing.. exmple a range hates gnolls because they killed his parents..<P>TRACKING<P>This was promised and I would like to see this implemented... I am ashamed when a BARD or a Druid out track me.. simply because my list is too small to hold everything that I could possibly track... <P>ARCHERY<P>This is a very delicate subject.. I think that rangers use their bows as primary weapons more than ANY CLASS would.. specially in a fantasy setting.. if it was made combat efficient it would be a coding problem within the game.. so I suggest.. why not a PROFESSION bonus.. ??<P>JOLT<P>This would depend on what other changes you take to fix our defensive problems.. I do think that if nothing is done about it we get to cast this spell at 49th level and make it lure/lifetapt resist.. BUT I must disagree with the use of a spell at all.. rangers are SKILL FULL fighters that don't wear plate.. our way to avoid being destroyed should be a SKILL!!!<P>SPELLS<P>I am glad to hear about a lot of the spell changes.. the cold resists series, skin like nature and the self only shield upgrades specially.. spells such as fire fists and all other lower level ones will HELP our younger community immensly.. as far as stacking issues I am unsure about this since I have not played with my new Call of X series much.. I am sure my fellow rangers will comment on those..<P>FINAL THOUGHTS<P>My thoughts are that the balance problems that rangers have are more to the effect that they don't represent the FANTASY RANGER that everyone knows about.. The nimble fighter with great agile skills<P>Maraia Falconhand<BR>Apprentice Pathfinder</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1) Archery; needs to be improved, Rangers are the MASTER of the bow, we should get more damage/to hit bonuses with a bow. Also, arrows with procs that always work, magic arrows that never miss, and some sort of extremely rare nodrop arrow (ranger only of course) that returns back to the Rangers hand once it hits. Two more things on Archery: First, not being able to shoot an arrow because I'm too close or I am too high above (ever hear of snipers?)and needs to be gone.Second, there are countless weapons and armor in EQ that look awesome and are awesome (of course there are duh), there needs to be BOWS that look cool as well, not some stupid stick!<P>2) Tracking; some good improvements were implemented during the last month or so, there needs to be more Ranger only tracking options (filters, scroll bar etc...)<P>3) Spells; Ranger spells are pretty good as is. SoW should be left at lv 39. It would be nice to have ONE self TP spell, one idea would be to have 3 spells at lv 30 39 or 49 (one of those) the 3 spells would be called "Return Home" or something like that but anyway there would be one spell for each ranger race. (human woodelf halfelf) the Human spell would gate the ranger to WC, Wood Elf spell to Gfay, Half Elf to WK or NK.<P>4) Defense; Rangers should get defense skill equal to Knights Offense Skill. Other defensive skills such as Parry, Dodge should be equal or greater to Warriors. I mean how can some big Ogre Warrior wearing full cumbersome platemail dodge better than a Wood Elf Ranger in light chain?! <P>5) Skills; Where is the Ranger's Pet? Rangers should get a skill (gained at a higher lv than level 10 or whatever) that summons a wolf or perm. charms an animal that could be reused every 90min (who is very low green) to be your companiion, it wouldn't respond to commands. Because it is green it wouldnt't help much but it fits the Ranger perfectly! Or another idea would be to make it a skill like LT, HT. Maybe called Nature Aid that refreshes every 90min, when used a few animals would pop out of nowhere and attack the enemy for a few seconds then vanish..<P>6) Hit Points; Rangers need an increase in HP, we are more warrior than druid even though we have roughly the same HP as druids.<P><BR>Mytheon Silverthorn, 39th Season<BR>&lt;Bane Sidhe&gt; Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First, let me start off by saying how thankful I am that you guys are taking the time to listen to our suggestions.<BR>I believe the best thing that can be done to help balance the Ranger class would be to give SOW earlier on. Rangers are more of a melee class than casters, and don't have near the hp that they should. Almost all of the spells before 22 are useless, except for practicing skills that Rangers will use later on. At 23, I still am not able to solo successfully and still have problems getting into a group. Now Druids, our partent class, don't seem to have this problem since they are always welcome to buff the group members with sow (just look at how many Druids choose to play ananomously due to the constant tells they receive). I don't think Rangers should get sow at a very low level since that would swing the Ranger-Druid class relationship way off balance, but I dont think Rangers should have to wait until 39 to get sow either. It should be given at 25 or so. <P>Also, another gripe I have about Rangers is the fact that my Wood Elf Ranger can only be bound in cities. I would think that a class that is described as "being at home in the forest" would only be able to be bound out of doors, not the other way around. <P>I also think that far too much emphasis is being put on Rangers as the "Master Archer" class since very few of us use our bows with any regularity. Bows are only useful to us as a means of kiting (cast root, shoot a few arrows, cast again....)and this is done in only the most dire of circumstances when there is NO ONE around willing to take a Ranger into his group. I, personally, feel that kiting is no fun at all since I enjoy the companionship and role-playing in group combat. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Venture,<P>I repsect your right to your opinion, but I don't agree.<P>What is the real balance benefit of Panic Animal going live?<P>Keep in mind that a level 22+ Ranger can already solo very well, and can tank very well for groups. <P>Keep in mind from a role play standpoint that Rangers are Protectors of the Glade and hunt poachers to protect animals. They do't go around frightening the crud out of nature's own for grins. (but Necros do  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> )<P>Keep in mind that fear + snare + dual wield + DoT + ATK Buffs + SoW(later on) + animal zones (like the Karanas, The Overthere, Lake Ill Omen, Eastern Wastes, and Iceclad) will attract both; many twinks to the class, and a d00d reputation.<P>On that comment about the 'n3cr0' red soloing. I very rarely fought a red con with my Necro. Too much risk. I preffered low blues for fast, safe playing. However, I did solo a very red Orc chief(Lesser Faydark) for two levels. I did solo a red con Ghoul Boss. I did solo a red con Mino Hero. I solo'd all of those red cons with my second Ranger, snare, and the aid of a Trueshot Bow.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oh something i have wanted since kunark came out but since absor is like never gonna respound i guess i'll post it. I really really would like iksar rangers. Iksar to me seem very connected to nature they sorta remind me of the american indians especially with the names of there zones, The overethere the lake of ill omen. Not to mention that iksar and rangers are limited to chain armors. Iksar have good agi and wisdom. Iksar make perfect sense as a ranger class. Not like all these people who just want dark elves so we can have 200 drizzit clones per server.
