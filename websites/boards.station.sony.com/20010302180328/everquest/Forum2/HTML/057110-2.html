</FONT><HR>I agree with the premise.<P>Kunark:<P>I don't have a big problem with except Kunark, I think there should be more bind points for melees, also the evacs there are messed up bigtime, because you have to go to a dungeon to use them.  New port spells to the those zones would fix the problem. <P>For example, it's very hard for lower levels to get to a low level dungeon like Kurns Tower.<P>More portals in Kunark esp in Overthere and Firiona would help a lot.  Although Lake of Ill Omen, Field of Bone and Frontier Mtns would be good zones too, assuming the evacs were fixed.<P>Velious on the other hand ... sucks eggs unless you just play in the 3 most accessible zones.<P>Then there is Kael.  Running through that with invis on is a nightmare.  Of course you can fix that by wrecking your dwarf faction.  But there are no alchemy vendors there!  Quite few less giants on the path would be nice!  The one time I went thru I saw well around 20 Giants, in three cases 4 abreast.  Invis dropped on our ranger at the last giant group, but we made it to zone.<P>Wakening:  Delete/Remove Wuoshi, my god!  What a terrible idea!<P>Skyshrine, not too bad, get an invis and run to the portal.<P>The whole portal thing is a mess, btw.<P>Cobalt Scar key is soul-bound, so no problem there, haven't died there yet though.<P>Sirens grotto.  Start over my god!   You almost cannot pass through there with out Evac or Succor (57 level evac spells) <P>That's why most people won't see the Western Wastes.  Then again if melee types die in Western Wastes while they are bound in Thung ... Thurg... Thrang...(the Coldain city...:P ) they are mega mega hosed... to put it mildly.  (unless they can find a port or a rez to the West Wastes, assuming they have the tooth thingee)  <P>Oh well, West Wastes is not for pickup groups.  Also the dragon Gate and Summon routine makes it rather problematic.<P>Sebille, 49 Shaman, Ayonae Ro.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>People gripe endlessly about class concerns( heh including me) but Travel time, especially at high levels, is the main reason I will be leaving EQ for the next playable MORPG. It is DULL DULL DULL to do that same run to Sebilis.<P>And it positively STIFLES exploration and daring to visit those far flung dungeons. Zones are crowded because people want a gauranteed group when they visit somewhere. <P>This style of play is what I call "Boredom Aversion". If you travel to an underused zone and it is mostly empty you miss out on a group. So you choose the crowded zones - hence they get even more crowded. <P>The sad thing is your missing out on variety playing that way. But lets face it, it is better to choose the "safe" grouping option even if you have been to the zone many times before than risking not finding a group at all.<P>OF course ultimately this means that EQ gets old for people sooner than it normally would. There seems to be little provision for a high level player who has less than 3 hours to play ( many dungeons require this as a minimum ). Your evening's play can be shot if it takes longer than an hour to find a group.<P>And as a side issue Velious's raid only requirements for 50+ dungeons is another poor poor decision. It needs a KArnors and Sebilis.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Are you kidding me? Don't you read the posts?<P>According to the various posts around the board there are two druids for every one of the other classes. With all these druids running around surely you can get a port and a sow. After all verent has made us the most uber class in the universe with our new healing comming, yet has made many of our spells ineffective indoors. So you can always find a druid outside rdy to stop kiting, bind and port you on your merry way!<P>/sarcasm off</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Right now, I stand confused as to Verant's "Vision" on things.  They want us to explore the world, yet they make most parts of the world extremely dangerous.  They want us to branch out, but they make it impossible to do so without taking a worthless risk.  They want us to enjoy Velious, yet they make it an exclusive club for uber guilds.<P>This is why I have consumer's guilt over just joining EQ a month ago.  I've recently read an article on Anarchy Online which simplifies the whole traveling thing.  They encourage you to stay in the cities you're born in, unless you're REALLY adventurous, in which case you'd want to journey outside of the city and into the PVP zones.  This eliminates the downtime of travel and increases roleplaying (the emphasis is laid heavily on your faction with either the corporations or the rebellion, or whatever).  I think Everquest should have been like this.  Sure, it's sometimes fun to run around and explore new worlds, but why must I die so many times DOING it?  Why would my character want to leave when his treetop village is STILL being attacked by orcs?  Why would I venture out of Kunark when I know my people are just starting to rebuild?<P>It's absolutely nuts, it really is.  I'm a druid and it's still hard for me to port places I need to go.  If I fizzle, or make a bad gate, or whatever, I've just spent a good chunk of my mana.  Between that and the constant SoW requests (going /anon doesn't help anymore, these guys are so desperate they'll stalk you if they think you're a druid, looking to see which spells you cast), my mana is always below 1 bubble.<P>I just hope travel becomes heavily fascilitated in the coming months.  Everquest is wide open for competition from any other game that can reduce downtime, increase roleplaying, and make the game much more fun.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>People always say "go out, explore." Exploring gets you dead with a 4 hour corpse recovery.<P>Last time I tried to explore I died near King Room and it took me 3 hours and 4 deaths just to get my corpse.<P>No thanks.<P>Give me one good reason to go to a zone like Kedge or Paw or the Hole.<P>I don't care if the xp is better. I don't care if the loot is better.<P>The one overriding concern is convenience. If there's a good chance that I might have to run more than 2 zones to get my corpse, I'm not going, it's just not worth it.<P>The chances of me going to some out of the way zone or dungeon, and getting a group, and coming home 3 hours later with something interesting in my bag is just about nil.<P>The chances of me going to some out of the way zone or dungeon, not finding a group or dying and then spending 4 hours trying to get my corpse back are excellent. I've done it many times, it's not a surprise anymore. Every single time I've decided to explore, I've regretted it because all my time is eaten up just by getting my corpse.<P>The way that things currently are would make good sense *IF* the majority of the population were RL friends and always travelled and hunted together. Then it would all make good sense. The wizzy would port everyone around, the cleric would rez everyone, everyone would do their job and everybody would have fun.<P>But that's not the EQ reality for most of us. Most of the people I meet are through pickup groups. The wizzy is there for as long as he feels like playing. If I die and he feels like logging, I'm SOL. This is not my friend, this is not my buddy who's going to lift a finger to help me.<P>Ports cost money, rezzes cost money, plat is finite, and there is not always someone around willing to do it. I have spent up to about an hour just looking for a bind in FREEPORT. Even when you yell out that you'll pay for it, it's not like anybody's starving for cash. Why should they stop and bind someone when they could be out making exp?<P>The basic premise behind the game design relies upon people cooperating and forming tight bonds of friendship, but that's not the human race as I know it.<P>Yeah it would make sense that people would get together and help each other out, but it doesn't happen in real life and it's not going to happen in an unforgiving video game.<P>You think if I need a port somewhere after grouping with a bunch of people that the group is gonna stop what it's doing just so the wizzy can port me?<P>Fat chance. They're there to get experience and loot. The wizzy's not my friend, he's not my "companion." This is not a union of friendship, it's a business relationship. We all do what we can so we can all make the best exp and loot we can. That's it.<P>I've had groups in guk where half the group died, the cleric and wizzy ported and then the cleric got called for the Frenzy group. She's not gonna leave Frenzy group just to rez us. And when I finally make that 4 zone run from Freeport, I'm left dragging my own corpse and paying for my own rez.<P>Class dependency assumes that people are going to cooperate and take care of each other. But that's not the game we're playing. The cleric is taking care of one person, herself. The druid is taking care of one person, himself.<P>And that's very understandable. The game is unforgiving. When you're trying to make up all that xp you lost yesterday, you're not really apt to think about wasting 2 hours to help out some tank that died 3 times trying to get his corpse.<P>And that's why the zones that are packed will stay packed, and the zones that are empty will stay empty. Because there is no incentive to go there. I don't care what drops there.<P>I don't care how much xp the mobs give. If it's going to mean a 4 hour recovery, people just aren't going to go.<P>But it won't change until there's a playable MMORPG on the market. They have no reason to change EQ, there is no competition, nowhere else for people to play.<P>The only time VI will ever consider changing something as fundamental as class "interdependency" (I'm trying to say that without cringing) and travel is when people start leaving.<P>And frankly that's not going to happen until a polished product comes out from a competitor.<P>Salian.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wow Fizzle32 i really do feel bad for you, i've been in many pick up groups and have gated party members out that i may have just meet a few hours back because they need it and for the time there in my group i help when i can im just sorry to hear that you have met some people out there thattreated you the way they did but its not that suprising i guess, it seems thats what the player base is made up more and more of these days,greedy kids( or people with the mind set a child)that have no thought for anyone other then themselves.<BR>Maybe ALL the fault dosen't lye with just Verant but with some of us..ask yourself..when was the last time you helped a person in need and asked for nothing in return? Something to think about <BR>======================<P>You're absolutely right, the fault does lie with *US* that the current interdependency system isn't working out.<P>But that's the same in RL. People have been saying forever that everyone should help each other as much as they can, love thy neighbor and all that stuff.<P>But you still have people cutting each other off at rush hour and flipping each other the bird.<P>Same thing in game. Most people in game believe in the idea of helping others out if they can, but when you only have a couple of hours to play, that makes it difficult. I'm sure clerics would love to go around rezzing everyone but the fact of the matter is that rezzing costs mana, and mana means time. So if they stop to help 3 or 4 people with a rez, that's a half hour of game time that they miss.<P>People need to be more independent. There needs to be alternate ways for everybody to be able to do certain things.<P>If nobody will stop to bind you, there needs to be a way for you to do it yourself, with a potion or something.<P>If nobody will stop to rez you, there needs to be a way to get back to your corpse more quickly than a 4 zone rone.<P>I will ACCEPT that death needs to carry a penalty, but that penalty should not be playtime.<P>If every time I die I have to run 4 zones to get my corpse, then that's an hour that I can't play.<P>I'm not being greedy. I'm not asking to be King of the Hill, I'm not asking for the game to be easier.<P>ALL I WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO IS PLAY. I don't care if I never get to 60, I don't care if I don't get the best stuff. Power is never what this was about. I just want to be able to fire up the game, play for a couple hours either alone or in a group, and log.<P>But the game doesn't provide for that. Sometimes you get to play, and sometimes you don't. Sometimes you get a group, sometimes you don't. Sometimes you die and spend the rest of your play time recovering.<P>THAT is the problem. Running to get your corpse does not qualify as "play time." Sitting there for 3 hours shouting for a group and waiting on lists does not qualify as playtime. Waiting for a boat for an hour does not qualify as playtime.<P>We're not asking to all be tank mages or super powerful. All we're asking for is to be able to play.<P>And to answer your question, yes I have helped people out when there was nothing in it for me. I try to help as many people as I can. But the game is harsh and nobody's going to leave a group to help out some unfortunate. That's how it is.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Great thread Eduin. <P>Travelling with the only goal of getting from A to B is the MOST boring part of EQ. It is almost as boring as meditating (which i aknowledge to be a necessary part of the game). There is no 'risk' in travelling a zone where everything cons green and/or that you have travelled 10+ times before. It is mindnumbing. <P>Verant, ive had enough of the flora and fauna of places like Swamp of No hope and Trakanons Teeth. Running from Sebilis to Firiona Vie and back is NOT thrilling anymore, and neither does it tickle my sense of exploring something new. I have conquered Alternate Planes, slain dragons and committed to largescale pvp, hell i even have my epic quest item... but for the sweet love of Kabob i still cannot traverse any distance without having to run it (or begging someone for a port, which i hate... and im sure the porters do too).<P>Running through a zone the first 5 times is fun, after that you need a frontal lobotomy to find any amusement from it. At least give those who dont want to explore every single bush and mob an OPTION to having to run through the zones.<P>Spending hours travelling, and even worse waiting on others to travel, is a complete and utter waste of time. I am beginning to think Verant are payed by ISP's for making zones larger and more remote. Do you have any idea how long it takes to get 3 full groups of players from a variety of zones to meet up for a raid on Howling Stones? Its laughable. I have to log off by the time everyone has arrived.<P>Ideas for making travel easier:<P>Two way firepots (requiring an ingredient that expends??).<P>More port locations.<P>Alchemy gate potions to Field of Bones and the Great Divide.<P>More bindspots.<P>Storebought potion that when consumed sets up a bufficon... when the buff wears off after X minutes you are taken back to the original place of consumation. Make it expensive, make it no drop, make it lore, make it no rent... whatever.<P>Thats just off the top of my head. There are ways to fix this problem, the question is, do you at Verant even aknowledge this to be a problem and are you willing to look into it?<P>Im guessing you will respond to this thread (if you even do) with: 'Travelling works well and as intended. At the time we have no wish to change it. Doing this would effect class balance.'<P>Let me let you in on a small secret Verant, changing the art of travelling would make EQ a MUCH more enjoyable and appealing game. As is i do NOT recommend this game to friends primarily because of the time it takes to get around. <P>People play this game for enjoyment. Travelling (for the majority of players) is NOT fun. And NO, wasting our time in travelling is NOT a necessary evil. There are ways around it, if you only wanted to do something about it.<P>Slightly upset player signing off.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You guys don't seem to understand..<BR>If it takes you two hours of *running* to get somewhere, thats two hours of *not getting exp* which means your character doesnt fly through levels. Which means they keep you around longer, collecting their monthly payments. <P>Think about it like this. How many of you would walk off game and never play again because you couldn't get a port to the EXACT dungeon you wanted. They know you wont.<P>Its a game. Part of that game is traveling. When you wake up in the morning, do you instantly teleport to your school/work/whatever ? No.. You get in a car, and you drive however many minutes it takes to get there. Same principle. <P>However, do not take this as a "I think this idea is stupid" comment. I myself have a 40 druid, and I can tell you I HATE being asked for a port every 10 minutes. Its getting so bad now that even though I'm anon, that means I have something to hide. So people still ask me, "Are you a druid or a wizard? Can you port me? I dont have any money but I want you to stop what your doing, and run to me, and pick me up even though you dont know me, and take me someplace because I wanna go get phat lewtz."<P>Socoro 46 Necromancer<BR>Gwynne 40 Druid<BR>Spiritcharm 31 Enchanter<BR>Zefria 28 Cleric<P>Needless to say, I still manage to get around without my druid.

I dunno bout you, but to me, games should be 100% enjoyment whenever possible or it ain't worth playing.<P>Travelling across multiple zones that either so red I'm in mortal danger (FV back when I was 20, Siren's Grotto nowadays), or so green It's not funny (FV nowadays, WC and EC except for the occassional Griffin or HG and Sgt. Slate, and even those are getting rather Ho-humish nowadays), is not fun.<P>Luckily there is enough about EQ that is fun enough to keep me playing, but I can garuntee you all the downtime from having to travel so much will probably be the breaking point that makes me quit.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree.....I don't have a problem with a degree of difficulty in the game being a melee and not being able to bind and having typically run our most all corpse runs, but there comes a point when it goes beyond sanity. No need to re-iterate what has been posted just a big /agree.<P>I don't know which is worse....being a melee and really needing to find a port bad or being a porter and having to play taxi for everyone.<P>Oh that's simple....the taxi's make money on it.<P>Another HUGE imbalance. No class can turn over PP like porters, maybe Clerics w/ rez. Maybe.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What a ridiculous thread, give warriors teleports, speed up transportation...whatever.<P>If anything, travel in EQ is TOO fast.  In RL, do you see people RUNNING everywhere, without stop?  EQ is a world full of Forest Gumps for crying out loud.  If anything, they need to slow down travel, so people would appreciate just how big everything is.  Imagine if everyone had to actually walk places, instead of running?  That hike from Qeynos to Freeport would be an adventure in itself then.  By allowing people to run alomost unlimited distances, they have already sped up the game pace, perhaps even too much.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There's a line.  There's a line between making a game 'video-gamey' where distance is mostly meaningless, and what we have now, which is extreme frustration.<P>It was a laudable idea, for the game designers to make the world 'vast'.  But it's ultimately not working.  All it does is make the world boring, and dull.<P>Changing locations in EQ is hard, especially as a tank-class.  Very hard.  You have to hoof it through zone after zone, dodging mobs, to get to a bind site, then sit around waiting for someone playing an INT/WIS caster to actually decide to take thirty seconds from their life to give you the ability to go get killed safely.<P>Player teleports ... I wouldn't mind this system as much if I could, during primetime hours, offer a reasonable sum of cash (20-30pp should be enough at any given moment, honestly) and get a port within a few minutes.  I would be okay with that.<P>Player teleports in reality, in the game we all play, are much, much longer than that.  It can take hours, if at all, to find a Wiz/Dru willing to take a few minutes to teleport.  The comment about twinks was dead on; who's going to bother to port people around when the Dru/Wiz they're playing is their twink?  No way, they don't need the cash being offered if they have a 50+ whatever that can collect money easily.<P>There should be enough bind points so there's *never* more than a two full zone run to a corpse (i.e., die and go back to bind point.  Run to bindpoint zoneline and zone, run through the next zone and zone, and you should be in-zone to your corpse).<P>There should be a teleport system between *all* the cities in Norrath.  Period.  You should be able to buy a 'port key' from a vendor for 20-30pp and click it on a pad object to teleport to the city corresponding to the port key you're holding.<P>There shouldn't be any zones that are more than three zones away from a teleport location (i.e., teleport in and zone out of that zone, cross a second zone, and the third zone is your destination).<P>It might be 'realistic' to make people sit at their computer 'travelling' for an hour or two, but it's sure as heck not very fun.  I play games to be stimulated and for enjoyment.  Hitting autorun and navigating between mob agro radii isn't my idea of fun though.  Guess I'm a spoilsport.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I play a wizard and as far as I'm concerned they can let ev every class (including tanks) have my ports so long as they give me some nukes that are worth a damn.  10% better nuker than a mage or druid doesn't cut it.  <P>There are no less than four wizard portals that will take you to a place where you can die instantly or very fast.  Many areas of the continents are still long runs from the nearest port, and some of the evacs require you to zone into a dungeon to use.  Then they [verant] throw at us that it's the fact that we can port that makes us balanced.  *boggle*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
