</FONT><HR>Normally we dont stoop to posting negative threads such as this oen but this is a special case and every one on TT needs to be aware..( although many of the larger guild are ALREADY aware)<P><BR>Wilro is a self admitted KSer who has ninja looted<BR>a FBSS from a group that included a clan mate.<P>Wilro was/is a member of a guild call Circle of unbroken truth on Terris.<P>Wilro has admitted to doing this...the gist of it is as follow...one name , for NOW is being left out as I will explain.  This is the BRIEF version.<P>Late last sunday night a party was camping the FBSS. The Fbss dropped, a charecter in the party ( who self admitdly as told to myself and others was wilro playing his friends account who for now is being held namelss (more on this)..in any case the fbss was looted.  "wilro" then went LD.  The wilro came back and sent a tell to a party member saying he was lagged. Wilro then sat down and camped out.<P><BR>A short time later the charecter in question came back on, transfered the fbss to the REAL charecter actually named Wilro at which point wilro has admitted to both myself and several of the people whom were in the group, that he sold the fbss for 10k, bought other items, and the FBSS was his, he didnt care and that sicne he went LD he was under no obligation to either turn over a fbss, 10k or items worth 10k.<P>He also was quite smug about being in a guild Circle of UNbroken Truth ( there were 3 people on with that guild tag at that time) and that he did NOT care as he had ALL the friends he would ever need.<P><BR>Now..the un-named charecter who is a RL friend of Wilro....is "quite" concerned that wilro used his account to do this. Whether or not this as of now, un-named charecter and Wilro and actually DIFFERENT people is uncertain.<P>For now the un-named charecter has agreed to obtain either a fbss, 10k or items worth 10K to turn over to me and I would then arrange the other 4 in that party to meet and they could lotto for said loot.  <P>Whether that happens remainsto be seen...this "un-named " individual has been given until Feb 5th to make this happen..after which point the Gms have agreed to step in as well as this "un-named" will be named both here and ingame.<P><BR>Be warned of this "wilro".  Research among some of the other guilds indicates he has stolen other goods in this manner.  I can only speak of that which I have direct knowledge of.   I would very much love to have the Leader of "circle of unbroken truth" contact me in game, as I am sure they will want to immediately disband said wilro..but so far they have not been seen to be on since that night.<P>Consider yourself warned about wilro.  Circle of Unbroken truth I strongly urger you to contact me in game IF you plan on ever being a guild with a good reputation.<P>Questions, comments concerns about this,, feel free to contact me in game. I am NEVER anon.<P>Thank you<P>Tortiebear Sleekpaw 54th druid<BR>Leader &lt;Clan Destine&gt; TT</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello I am a member of the guild in question. <BR>I would like you to know I have posted this on our guild page AND sent it to the guild leader. <BR>With that being said I dont think its fair that your putting a black mark on me and the whole guild because of something ONE person has done. <BR>im not going to say anything more as I know NOTHING of this incident. <BR>I have told the guild that if nothing is done either way about it that I will bow out of the guild...but will that do me any good as you have it posted up here that the guild is no good?<BR>ive grouped with lots of people with the guild tag flying above me. will they now not group with me because I use to have it up there or even if something is doen if it still flys up there? <BR>This is why its not  really nice to name any names here. your hurting around 40 people who did nothing  because of one persons actions. <BR>I have  grouped with the Genny who posts here (the Friday night Group) a couple of times id like to think that she would say I was a great tank for the group, and that I am an all around good person UNLIKE the person YOUR talking about above.<BR>Well ive said enough about something im NOT in the know about...LOL<P><BR>McKenzy Calhoune Level 26 Warrior TT<P>Please dont take this as a flame or another UBCT member being a jerk I have seen how a rep (GOOD or BAD) can get around a server and I have tryed to put out a good positive attitude, but something like this could hurt me and I did nothing.  thanks for your time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm thinking you should have gone about this a different way. First off, find out if the guild has a webpage. If they do, you should have emailed the leader types with all this info, watched for follow-ups, and if there weren't any, THEN you should have started message board protests.<BR>Seem silly? It shouldn't, I've had email discussions with two different guilds now and both were quite productive.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First for Blue....<P>As you can see there was never a direct derogatory remark made towarsd your guild..howvere a guild tag serves to identify an individual and so far we had been unable to contact the leader of your guild  and wilro has been keeping a low profile...<P>HOWEVER.....<P>last night that changed.  I have met and spoken with the guild leader and another representative of your guild.  They only learned about this yesterday..no doubt fomr you posting thing on your guild msg board.  As soon as Tristan ( your leader) heard he made his way to see me in SK.  We also brought in a member of our guild who was grouped with the scum wilro in the party at the time the fbss was ninjad.<P>It became quite obvious that your guild IS an honorable one. Your leader had no knowledge of this activity nor does he condone he.... Wilro was removed from your guild as well as any alternates as it seem Wilro also shares his account with his brother.<P>Your guild appears to be a fine guild....there are some who feel that in situations like this that it is the guilds responsibility to make restitution...we do not feel that way in this circumstance..it was obvious that your guild had no knowledge of Wilro's activites and Wilro will and is VERY quickly  finding out that his days are over on the Terris server in terms of being able to find groups and join a reputable guild.<P>Your guild handled this promptly and with great honor and efficiency....I myself would be proud to be a member of your guild as it seems you all have high standards of conduct..as do we.<P>Wilro is a self admitted ninja looter, backstabber and a account sharer. he uses his friends accounts and "rapes" them for what he can.  His rep is ruined forever on the server and this is NOT the first time he has done this.<P>It appears that for Wilro....his attitude of that he has "all the friends he needs" may soon be coming up short.<P>To the Unbroken Circle...the Clan salutes you and calls you all Friend.<P>Tortiebear Sleekpaw 54th druid<BR>Leader &lt;Clan Destine&gt; TT</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>and a quick note for guava....<P>for 5 days we tried to get in touch with the guild leader in question...it became apparant thru really no ones fault , it became apparant last night in the talks that the messages were not relayed.  yes this board is used as a last resort...BUT as you can see it was effective, it becomes clear to any and all who read this that Unbroken is honorable and has taken the right course of action, and yes a guild IS responsible for its members....<P>UNbroken has shown that.. and if we could have reached their leader sooner or by any other method we would have done so. <P>But we are also rapid in posting what has happened, and have also cleared up the fact that the guild does not tolerate people like Wilro.<P>Handing a guild tag out to someone puts your guild rep on the line...it should NOT be taken lightly...as each persons action will be representative of said guild.<P>But be that as it may, until such time as Verant  posts a central site eith emails for each and every guild leader, sometimes communications czn be difficult...it took 5 days, but it was done, it was handled well and with honor, and it becomes quite clear that Wilro is goign to be left out in the cold....as will the other "un-named" person if restitution is not met quickly.<P>Tbear out</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have been asked to make a final post on this by the parties involved.....<P>Esp as those in the party that night have gotten tired of waiting for the "un-named" individual ( a ranger named "udien" to make restitution. Udien has been conspiciously(sp?) absent ...no doubt hoping everyone would forget.<P>Udien's charecter was the one in the group that night and Udien ninja-looted the fbss.  Now it turns out Udien has allowed a rl "friend" (Wilro) to have access to his account. Wilro then used Udiens account to ninja the fbss, tranfer it to wilro where wilro then sold it and gave the items to a char named "speedyracer"<P>Wilro's account is actually one on the same account shared by wilros real life brother "robio" <BR>a 22nd unguilded paladin. I say unguilded because it was actually Robio who allowed his brother Wilro to have access to account and feels that he is not responsible either.<P>In any case, Robio has been disbanded from his guild, and I am sure Robio, Wilro, Udien and Speedyracer will have lots of fun going solo, as NO guild of any self worth will ever touch them.<P>All parties mentioned above have also freely admitted to their involvement and their actions, so there is no doubt as to their involvement. In fact several of them boasted to multiple people, inlcuding yours truely that there was nothing that could be done.<P>It is sad that a child such as "wilro" feels he can do whatever he wanted...his actions have now ruined the reps of several people in the game...and those that think they will be forgotten are wrong.  Udien choose NOT to make restitution to those involved, so can live with the consequences of allowing his account info to be shared.  The same as for Robio. <P>Speedyracer knew full well the items he was given from Wilro were bought with the "blood money" that wilro used from the stolen fbss.<P>IN any case..Wilro probably wont be allowed to play until this summer...but dont worry Wilro, there will be plenty of us who keep you on our "friends" lists, as well as these others....<P>We will all still be here should you try and pull this stunt again.<P><BR>Tbear out<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Tortcat, I am just walking into this with no background information, but could you please clarify how the buyer is responsible here?  Without any information presented to that effect, how do you know he is responsible at all?  Chances are I have at one point (unknowingly of course) bought ninja-looted items in EC at one point, and I consider both myself and my guild [Divine Symphony] to be very respectful.  If someone was to claim it was stolen property, how do I know that person isn't just trying to swindle me?  And if you did indeed have a GM that was satisfied with the result there, they should replace the item for you without taking it from the buyer (unless you left something out on your post?).<P>Please keep in mind that I have no source of information other than what was presented here.  I am not taking sides either, just asking that you justify your claims that we should not allow Speedyracer the benefit of our groups, etc.  Unless there is missing evidence here, Speedyracer should not have been mentioned as anything more then the buyer.<P>Yes, and I know what it is like to be Ksed or ninja-looted.  Once I was in SK and my girlfriend was near (mage in her teens).  I happened to see a pegasus (horrible spelling but Quillimane: the one now for the mage epic); I figured I would let her loot as a present, etc.  I was kiting it and a high level mage (notice no name?) KSed it from me.  Now, if the cloak was not no-drop, I would certainly not expect someone who purchased it to refund me (even if it was proven).  Only those actually involved in the problem are at fault.<P>Anyhow, just waiting for your response (no accusations of either side mind you).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
