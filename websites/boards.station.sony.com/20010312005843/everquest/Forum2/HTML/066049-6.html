&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Im going to go point by point over why clerics have been having issues with VI ever since the release of Kunark. <P>Kunark is released and many new spells arise and are ooohed and aaahed over. Spell drops seem to be less than satisfactory to say the least (winning a spell was akin to finding the holy grail). After 2 months of players telling Absor that spells were TOTALLY off base they are fixed. <P>Cleric spells begin to get examined as they are finally found. Fast examination----<BR>1)Death Pact--kind of like flipping a 8 sided coin hoping one side will come up. <BR>2)Divine Intervention--oh goody more expensive to cast, fades faster and the coin has 50 sides now<BR>3)Fortitude--um ok its worse than hero but hey it wont block Herobond<BR>4)Wave of Tranquility---AE Lull no thanks suicide isnt in the job dedription; resist resist resist resist THUMP THWACK SLICE owwwwwwww DA DA DA INVULN NO HEALS <BR>5)Celestial Elixir--Im surprised it stacks with cleric buffs it wont stack with anything else<BR>6)Divine Light---there was a reason it was called divine fizzle (oh wait the druids got the fizzle rate fixed when they got SH lowered in level)<BR>7)Yaulp IV--um yes well I wont bother to explain this one if you dont get it I wont convince you<BR>8)Banished Summoned--mana ratio pathetic plain old DD is just as good <BR>9)Paralyzing Earth--Enstill seems to last as long and wont fizzle as much <BR>10)Trepidation--fear spell? Where am I supposed to use that again? AE Pulling? ok got it<BR>11)Antidote--broke was supposed to be a reoccurring cure poison but it casts once and goes away<BR>12)Banishment of Shadows--requires a pricey reagent and doesnt kill anything above about 44th, doesnt leave a corpse and doesnt give exp (but hey anything it will kill is green anyway)<BR>13)Unswerving Hammer of Faith--100 hps good for one fight and if it gets hit by ANYTHING for one round in Kunark its dead. <BR>14) Word of Redemption---the one time you need this thing you wont get the time neccessary to load it and use it <BR>15)Lets not forget Herobond started as United Resolve--ick <P>Ok how did they do? Out of the 30 spells from Kunark only 15 will see use and be cast by clerics thats 50 percent. The thing that made this an overwhelming loss for clerics was the one true Gem of the lot Mark of Karn got well and truly nerfed and made pointless to cast. Well if you want to eliminate damage shields with something that fizzles every other cast ok. These spells and spell issues have NEVER been addressed by the tuning team. Argue if you like some of them have simply gotten less effective if anything. <P>--The nerfing of Donals Arms <BR>--Donals drops themselves (recently righted)<BR>--The farming out of the res to Paladins and Necros (it does save raids though not a complaint its just further proof that VI has done things that they flatly stated to clerics they would not)<BR>--Nerfs of the Kunark and Velious BPs one nerf after another (you want to eliminate the heals FINE but for gods sake have an alternative ready to replace; the new ability should be useful to clerics not just another same ole same ole)<BR>--Heal Agro; raise the bar rediculously high then lower it to where they wanted it in the first place and saying "there see we helped you"<P>Verant has repeatedly time and again disappointed clerics by nerfing them nerfing their spells and leaving them with no options. Clerics need a group as much as a group needs a cleric. I dont get why you cant see that almost every time clerics have been nerfed that the people AROUND them suffer as well. Effecient clerics mean faster experience for the most part--I say again they arent just nerfing clerics they are nerfing the groups and raids they are in.  <P>As far as the healing agro being able to be worked around....I disagree. In Western Wastes if 3 rogues, 2 Monks and 9 tanks are all beating on a named Dragon and I cast Divine Light (cant cast Celestial Elixir it wont stack with just about anything and will just get dispelled if the mod has been AE dispelling) that mob will ignore the pets and the melee and the wizards and the Shaman and mage and enchanter debuffing it. That mob will do its level best to pound me into the ground like a tent peg until its dead or I am or I manage to get a Invuln cast off. Now this didnt happen EVERY time but it did happen often enough that I got VERY wary of casting heal on my lead tank and settled into chain casting Remedy sadly enough. Made stunning the gating double names a heck of a pain in the rear. If you root these mobs they will summon. If you atone them they will most likely resist. And hey look stun gets 2 saves so they get TWO tries to resist it. I cant even imagine what things like Zlandicar and Yelinak would do to me. LOADING PLEASE WAIT comes to the front of my mind. <P>Clerics have been ignored and nerfed--say whatever you like this basic fact is true. We are complaining. We would like to see something done for our class that is positive. Is that too much to ask? <P>Thanks for your time, Belkram of BristleBane Cleric of 59 Levels<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The original post as well as Naelya have been well writen and well thought out.  And are very very true.  To any one that actualy plays in the 50+ world of everquest, this topic is something that DOES mean something to them, and has continuously been ignored by Verant.<P>Malaia, I'm sorry that you were offended by his post.  But he was making an anaolgy, one that works, and one that in many peoples eyes is very true.  You say he is "trivualizing" the actual events of that time.  No, he is compairing the thoughts and actions of two things.  Something that happened in the real world as oposed to what is happening in the EQ world.  Tell me something, do you get offended in a book when people are slaughtered en mass because of who they are?  I should hope so... because that is wrong.  Do you get mad at the author?  I hope not, they are writing a story and in this case expressing how low humanity can sink.  If you don't want to look at the fact that humanity CAN sink that low then you are asking for people to forget what happened, and thats the real threat.  If people don't understand what happened they may alow it to happen again.<P>Most of what we know and what is writen today is taken from history, that is what we know, that is what has made us what we are today.  If you can't learn from and use history.... then you are not credible.<P>Now any way, quit complaining about this, it is not the matter at hand and it is becoming nothing more than a troll to the issue that is at hand in this thread.  If you want to start another thread about this then please do so, but it has no place here.  This is about how Clerics have been mistreated, and how it is destroying the game for them as well as others thoughout Norrath.<P>Carry on.<P>Zachton Soulstriker<BR>56 Templar of the Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Malaia, first, I agree that the comparison lacked tact.  Second, I don't know how else to describe the site of a concentration camp myself other than "a sad place".  Where a cemetary might be described as "a peaceful place".  You are preaching a holier than thou message to the choir.  You're grandmother went where she did after the holocaust for a reason.  You might ask her about that reason before you lash out at everyone around you.  If you want to lash out, go to a klan or nazi meeting.

</FONT><HR>The game is constantly changing. Being too narrow minded to adapt to the changes in the game structure constitutues laziness on the clients part. Go ahead. Quit. I didnt hear you *****ing about getting celestial healing, about the new cleric armor, or about the cleric epic so what right do you have to complain about other changes? Please quit if you are so fragile as to not bend with the game, Im sure Ill have a better time finding a group.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>while i will certainly not defend baven's rl comparitor I DO agree with the point of his post. I cannot blame baven for being pissed.  Imagine trying to get your people together for raids on the dain, zlandicar etc and having the clerics say *(&(*@&# EQ i am done playing.  We have about 20+ clerics but since the nerfing it seems that not more then 4 or 5 feel like playing EQ anymore.  If AO or UO2 came out right now I think you would see 90% of the power guilds say the heck with EQ and move on. As it is now more and more of my friends are beta testing other games and playing games like Icewind dale (the expansion).<BR>  There is NO class in EQ which is as unreplacable as clerics. thank you VI for making clerics frustrated and sick of thier boring class. I am sure all of us who need them to heal us appreciate your efforts.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

That I have at least one nice thing that hasn't been nerfed.  I'm afraid to say that though because then it too becomes a target.  <P>In the meantime, it's still more fun playing my monk then it is playing my cleric.

</FONT><HR>I can only hope that Verant actualy takes a look at this. They have actively looked at the small picture and ruined their game =/<P>Also on a side note I hope to god Verant is not listening to the Jboot-wanting whiners and leaves Multi-questing alone. It has been in the game for ever and thus it is a PART of the game, changing it will have wide-spread disaster.
