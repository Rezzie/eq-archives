Anyway, I have a 54 SK, and I was wondering if any important changes have been made to them, or to EQ in general.<P>I saw someone say SKs need to be nerfed, and either a lot has changed or that guy must not be playing the same game as I'm playing. Or he's 'special'. Can anyone fill me on please? When I left I was a little distraught having just hit PoN. I would get aggro (my job) and promptly take such obscene amounts of damage I would either a: die, b: get yelled at by the cleric for forcing him to chaincast complete heals, or c: get the cleric killed by adds while he chaincasted complete heals. I love my class, just not while tanking reds that hit like trucks. Has anything changed?<P>Thanks a bunch.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

My character is only 54, but I spend more time in the bazaar arena than I do anywhere else(and shopping at the same time, kinda funny now that I think about it. Murdering people while trying to find a nice pair of shoes). I am very well equipped (IMO) and believe me, I eat my fair share of dirt.  My #1 worst nightmare in the arena is without a doubt a Shaman. Closely followed by Wizards, Bards(very well played ones) and Monks with those staves that stun you for like half an hour. Shadowknights have their fair share of silver bullets. There are also classes that I fight where it comes down to skill, equip, and luck,(Paladins are my favorite opponents, they are very evenly matched if you pace yourself) then there are classes I just outright own.<P>Remember, most Shadowknight self buffs require you steal whatever it is your buffing from the target(just like lifetap), so our buffs and debuffs are all rolled into one. However all of these spells, for some very strange reason, are disabled in PvP. This means I can't buff myself OR debuff my opponent. I do not understand why this was done, it's not like the ability to temporarily steal 20 AC, or 35 attack was so overpowered it had to be disabled like Charm and Fear. I would almost certainly never even memorize them in PvP anyway, since our spell bar tends to be very, very crowded. It would just be nice to borrow 25 strength from a monk who's hammering me down every now and then.<P>Well I guess I got sidetracked, but I pray that they aren't seriously considering nerfing my favorite class =(</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Another idea is to give it a cast time, and do max 50% dmg to another player.<P>Necros in general are very powerfull.  For blue servers, its fine.  But, in PVP LB needs to be nerfed like MB was.  LB isn't effected by the 75% cap to PVP, since its a dot.  LB and MB should be removed from PVP all together.<P>Lifetaps need to have more of a resist PVP.  Right now, for the most part they are lure.  You need close to 450MR to start resisting them.  250MR should be enough to _start_ resisting them.  So, basicly give them a -150 resist check.<P>Necros and SKs have too fast of cast time on there spells.  Diease based nukes that are .5 sec cast time ??  Wizards are supposed to be the masters of DD, yet there spells are much longer cast time and are reasoniable.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

EQ is not PVP. There is SOME voluntary PVP in arenas and a few sparsely populated PVP servers, but the huge vast majority of EQ is NOT PVP.<P>So, if a class is a better PVPer, that doesn't mean they need to be nerfed. IF you want to say "X ability should be tuned on the Zek servers", fine, go for it. But again, EQ is NOT PVP.<P>I have a 64 SK. I'm a pretty solid tank and puller. I am not overpowered in my opinion vis a vis other classes. Pre-PoP, SKs were pretty underpowered comparatively, now we're pretty decent. We got some solid 61+ spells. Some still need tweaking (Aura of Hate, 48 sec duration, 72 sec recast, some other retarded 1 minute duration spells). There are some things that could be improved, and some minor annoyances, but overall I am happy with my class.<P>I have played for about 2.5 years, and have in total maybe /duel'ed or fought in the Arena maybe 10 times. Some classes are better designed for it, some are worse. But personally, who cares? I don't do PVP, as about 95% of the EQ population doesn't do PVP regularly. <P>So I take huge exception to someone stating that abilities that are balanced PVE should be nerfed because they are unbalanced PVP (if they actually are). And that HT requires level 65 and about 50+ AA fyi, and is not unbalanced PVE, when it approximates 1 crit wizard nuke and is only usable every hour and a half. And those spears are often resisted.

Just like when Wizards complain about EQ/AM3 Rangers in PvP...<P>SK's are fine in PvP; I've dueled a ton of people with my SK; of the classes that were higher level than me, I've lost half of those fights (most memorable to a wizard and a necromancer)...<P>(of course all the ones that were under me were mostly Pallies and I didn't lose once...)</font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>I play a cleric and a wizard.  *IF* DT was removed, the .5 sec cast time on that nuke wouldn't be an issue at all.  Basicly, it can take about 2 secs to kill someone PVP with an SK.  It takes no skill, and is far overpowered.<P>From my wizards point of view, yes rangers are annoying.  *shrug* ... But, requires some work and skill.  Rangers where nerfed, they aren't as big of an issue as they where before.  So, presently, I have no reason to complain.<P>Again, let me point out that I am not talking about offical duels.  I am talking around, zoning into a zone where there is an SK in front of you.  Bam, instant death before you finish loading.<P>Now, before you say that clerics can't PVP.  You are mistaken.  It requires a great deal of skill and gear.  I am not the best, but I hold my own.  I have had plenty of mages, shamans, wizards, warriors, clerics, rangers, etc run from me over time.  The other reason I play a cleric, is becuase when me and a few friends go out PKing.  Its VERY hard to kill us.  Those are the times I am doing just heals, no melee, dispells, nukes, etc.  (Depending on whats going on)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I think it was the thing that popped into a lot of our heads when we read this.<P>Guess what. Everquest is not nor will it ever be a PvP centered game. I don't give a **** HOW overpowered Shadow Knights are on PvP. What I, and a HUGE percentage of the player base, care about is how balanced a Shadow Knight is in PvE.<P>PvP in Everquest is not something that SoE makes an active effort to balance, because that's not what Everquest is about. You guys have to accept that you get whatever works on 'carebare' servers. That's just how it is. Don't like it? Find a new game.<P>I'd like to make a comment on the term 'carebare'. Are you inferring that people on blue servers are in some way afraid of your punk 12 year old butts? That we would never dare to stand up to you in game or in person? I think both would be pushovers myself. Who won the Best of the Best tournaments? Not PvP servers characters, that's for sure. But why? Because your gear sucks? I guess that proves my point. PvP is never going to be balanced and that's the end of it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I had never even heard the term carebear until I started playing Asheron's Call Darktide. Whenever I'd post on a board or something they'd see my sig and tell me "shut up and go back to dorktide/quaketide/whatever". In AC, GMs didn't interfere with players. Ever. If you were getting your kills stolen, to bad. I never understood how people got by on the non-pvp servers there. On DT if someone stole your kills you shoved a fireball up his ***  and took his DIs. Unless he was better than you, in which case you went and got a friend and he did it too.<P>EQ has rules for things like KSing, so players aren't forced to police themselves. If it didn't, I couldn't imagine playing a blue server. It would be nice though, when someone demands you share your camp with them, or just acts stupid, to just beat their *** . Now I'm thinking about doing a char transfer...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I was always getting tired of people crying becuase they fell I am too close to there camp, I dropped an accidently train on them, etc etc.<P>I feel things like that are better left up to the player to deal with.  Generally, the above items are legal.  (same team training was made illegal, but for good reason, you can still train the other team however)<P>Just for future reference, no, not all people who play on the red servers are 12 year old kids.  The group of friends I play with all the time range in age from 18 - 40.  I am 25.<P>PVP in EQ does work, when its balanced properly.  Yes, its hard to balance PVE vs PVP, but it can be done.  Necros and SKs are the most overpowered classes when it comes to _PVP_ servers.  There are some easy simple steps that can be taken to make them more balanced.  Remove DT, LB and MB from PVP combat.  (Only for PVP servers, blue servers I don't care about)<P>The term carebear is geared to people like Clayton7 and Derakon-Beta.  Not only have they prolly never played on a PVP server, they do not understand the enviorment.  Saying that the zek servers are all 12 year old kids who can't play counterstrike (or some other FPS), and complaing how PVP was never meant for EQ is silly.  Thats why people on blue servers are labled as "carebear" servers.<P>Anyway, I was just responding to the question of are SKs too overpowered / "need to be nerfed".  In regards to PVP, yes.  Regards to PVE ... I have no idea.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Its the same in every level range. Try to hun in CaZIC Thule at lv 40 and you wont have any fun at all. A lv 52 maintank might survive a fight but he ll be a mana sink and not very effective while the very same tank at level 60 discovers that the zone which was a nightmare for him became much better to hunt in.<P>Red con MoBs tend to hit on every swing, they tend to hit very often for max damage so I think getting a few more levels under your wings before returning to PoP might be a good idea.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
