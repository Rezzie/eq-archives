</FONT><HR>I had begun to post this under priests thread, but wanted more people to see it...<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>EQ is still exciting to me.<P>My suggestions. <P>1) Wander through the old newbie zones that you never really payaed attention to.  Ever see the river with the skiff in Qeynos Hills?  What about the water falls in East Karana?<P>2) Turn off all channels, but say and group chat.  Don't talk about items, and try to roleplay.<P>3) Take people into your group reguardless of level and class.  It is amazing the nice people you can meet.<P>4) Talk to the NPCs.  I once watched a bard have a 10 minute conversation with one of the Barbarians in the Barb camp.  Oh, the Barb was not talking back, but there was some enat interaction.  I frequently talk to my pet and convey my emotions through them."What, Jabober?  Oh, that's not nice..." "Yes, i realize the rogue has been picking his nose, but maybe that is the culture where he is from..."<P>5) Find fun things to so, and fun people to be around.  Ever been spear fishing?  I once captivated an audience of over 20 people by showing them ow to spear fish.  I think that day was one of the better days in EQ.<P>6) Sit back and enjoy your surroundings.  My favorite day in EQ was sitting on a dock with four of my friends, fishing.  For 4 hours we fished and joked (he was the one who taught me to speafish, waaay back in the second week of release).  We made lasting friends there.<P>7) Never forget your frieds... no matter what level.  You have no idea how rewarding it is, for you and you friend, when you, 20 levels higher, comes and hangs out with a buddy and shares war stories and tales of bloody battles.<P>8) Remember it is not about items and cash, it is about your character advancing on toward their legacy.  They are a real person in this world, and interact as such.<P>9) Roleplay.  This is required for all of the above, and is the most important.  If you roleplay, and take Norrath as your own world, and your characters life as your own (mind you, only while in game, and looking at a clock every once and a while is okay =)  you turn EverQuest into a living, breathing reality.  Put yourself in the place of your character... feel what your character feels and think how your character would think...<P>Knowing game mechanics and the 'best way' to do something is fine for a while...  but roleplaying is the way to enjoy the game for much, much longer.  This applise to all aspects of the game, from class balance to items retrieved on the way to infamy.  When i first found my crysknife... or a shovel on the ground, i was exstatic to have found a new thing.  It did not matter to me whether or not there were 'better' and 'ph4tt3r' items... my character knows not of such things, since he has never seen them.<P>I stay away from EQ'Lizer... matter of fact, the only site i go to is EQ Maps, and that is ONLY if i am trying to find a new place to hunt and how to get there.<P><BR>I promise you, friends, try to follow any one of the above examples, and EverQuest will be totally changed for you...  try them before poking fun.  =)<P>--Secias<BR>*grabs his Kerran Fishing Spear and heads to the docks with a few other Spearfishers...*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>:P<P>It would be great if other people roleplayed too... I don't mind roleplaying at all, in fact, I do it quite often. The issue is when I say "How art thou? Would ye like a heal?" some dr00d would say: "HUH? [EXPLETIVE]D00000d... like i totally didnt underst00d what you s4id!"<P>Too many children play the game now to have good ole roleplaying fun.<BR><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]

</FONT><HR>Some of the best times I have are when I head back to the newbie areas and poke around there.  I always bring Soulfire along with me (love all the questions and /drool I get).<P>I'll usually hang out there, buff people, give them any spare stuff I might have gotten (I give out full suits of splitpaw if I happen to have been in Paw), and talk to people.  I answer questions from aspiring players (paladins and other melees mostly, but even some casters).<P>If I'm in Freeport I'll kill a couple of guards.  Gotta love the reaction from that, "I can't WAIT until I can do that."<P>The standard EQ hunt and hack day can still be fun, when I'm grouped with friends, but I still get such a kick out of hanging out with newer players and helping them out.<P>My all time favorite?  Going into WC and killing Kizdean Gix to help others out who fell into the same trap I did when I was a newbie.  He killed me four times in a row.  I've killed him close to 30 times now.  I bet he regrets meeting me.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Paulo Al'Deln &lt;Assembly of Norrath&gt;<BR>47th Knight of Truth<BR>Tunare Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Roleplaying isn't for everyone.<P>I HATE roleplaying.<P>people tend to ask "Then why did you BUY a RP game then?"  My answer to this is, it WAS MY money after all.  I can buy what I want to buy and play how I want to play.<P>All the above are decent suggestions I guess, but it would bore me totally.<P>to me, it is about levels, and experience, and items.  THAT is what is fun to me.  just because it isnt fun to you, doesnt mean it isnt fun.<P>IF I'm not having fun with my main, I play one of my lowbies, and play for levels money items and experience.  hmm, seems I must be having fun, because I have played for over a year.<P>Roleplay... does nothing for me.  My druid regularly groups with a dark elf necro, and a high elf pally.  who cares about roleplay in our group?  nobody.<P>My Ogre warrior groups with a halfling rogue, a high elf cleric, and a barbarian shaman.  we still have fun, and it doesnt take us 40 minutes to ask for a SoW.<P>people say SoW is not a word, or that it is a word for pigs.  well, if you are truly roleplaying, you would know that in EQ SoW IS a Word.  just because it means nothing to you on earth, doesnt mean it doesnt exist anywhere.<P>it seems to me all the accronyms are the "common" language of EQ, which in turn would mean all you roleplayers should use them too if you are speaking in Common tongue.

</FONT><HR>I have done a few things...<P>I seeded a few items onto lower level MOBs, though I hear that coins no longer work if you give them. <P>I found a regular group--you'll be surprised how much that helps you have fun.  <P>I have myself an "Apprentice".  Find someone who's new to the game--REALLY new, like, you can tell that he/she is new because of what they're doing--and help them out.  In my case, she was speaking only in OOC and didn't know how to change the speech mode, kept trying to run in and out of range of monsters she was meleeing, didn't know how to /consider, and didn't know how to inspect items by holding the right mouse button.  So I taught her from scratch, got her a few pieces of armor and some FS weapons, grouped with her as an alternate of mine, offered as many pointers as I could, and gave her a few lesser items I happened to find in my travels (nothing fancy, just gnomeskin and velium weapons).  Someday she'll be high enough to group with me. <P>I also never play to level up.  I remember trying hard to level early on and how much that sucked. I play to have fun; levelling up, to me, is a nice side effect.<P>Roleplay can take many forms.  I use acronyms, sure.  I never speak that pseudo-elizabethian English that some people prefer.  I am always telling stories and having fun and sharing info with my group.  As a Bard, that very well could be roleplay.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Some other tips..<P>1) People complain about their lack of power, but thats because they are always comparing themselves to even-con mobs.  Try doing a dungeon crawl with your high level chars, but in a empty lower level dungeon.  For example, I have heard there is a slime elemental in Runnyeye.  Its in there somewhere, but no idea where it is.  So get a few friends and clean out the dungeon.  Take your time and have fun.<P>2) People complain that exploring is too dangerous.  Well time to back to those zones you never really explored before and take a look at every inch.  It will suprise you what you find.<P>3) Work on making a set of dress clothes for yourself.  In other words, design yourself a set of "going to town clothes" out of items which exist in the game and you can equip, then go out and gather all the pieces.  Don't go for uber power, just for style.  personally I think the whole black-iron look is still a winner, as well as matching tooled leather.<P>4) Collecting things can be fun too... once I took a few weeks to collect all the wands, even though wands in EQ basically suck.  It was sure fun.<P>5) Try travelling through zones instead of porting over them.  If you are a class that sows or teleports, swear off them for a week and see the land on foot.<P>6) Try not to be in a hurry all the time.  Take the time to stop and talk to people.  Go to low dungeons like paw and crushbone and help people out now and then.  But its more fun if you are there to do just that.  Then you can methodically fight your way to a corpse, help get someone there, guard their back, and help them get out.  Much more of an adventure then.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
