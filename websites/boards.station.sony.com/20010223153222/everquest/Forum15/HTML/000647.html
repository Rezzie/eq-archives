</FONT><HR>MAXIMUS,<P>I will probably be flamed for this, BUT, IMHO, this is what I discovered about duel wield.  Up until lvl 20, you will have a damage cap placed on many 2hs weapons such as the Laminated blade or the Axe of Ironback.  In my 30s, I no longer duel wield, instead I have a laminated blade DAM 25  Delay 52 (or 54).  The double attack skill, while duel wielding, will reduce your stanima (yellow bar) very quickly.  With such a slow weapon as my laminated blade, I notice almost no stanima reduction.  I can also cast inbetween sword swipes with out interupting the "reset counter" on my sword.  VI fixxed that a patch or two ago.  I do MUCH more damage over the time of the melee with my slow weapon then I do with my faster ones.<P>Good luck with your Sword of Morin Quest.  I have killed the Ghoul Messenger (GM) many times, and he is a naisty ghoul too.  He con'd a dark Blue to me at level 30.  You should find a high level character to help you on that quest, just ask around.  The wondering spirit travels through West Karana and a HIGH (50+) level Shaman will probably ask you to track it for him.  In return ask him to kill the GM for you. I am sure anyone would happily help you if you ask.<P>In duel wielding, having the Sword of Morin and ANOTHER WEAPON with the EXACT same stats would be awesome.  I am currently trying to get any magical 1HS weapon that is as fast (22) and does the same or more damage (6)  also +3 STR  and AGI.  Until I earn that weapon (other then buying on the market place), I will hold onto my laminated blade.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I must say that tactic sounds like it would work if used correctly.<P>First let me ask this, if i use my sword to attack and then try to cast does one overwright the other, by this i mean can i cast when i swing or should i wait till after i swing to cast. i usually wait for the creature to attack before i swing. <P>and i must admitt that i have neglected all but my 1hs skill i figured i would build my pierce when i get dual wield and dont plan to use blunt but i seem to need to rethink this stand i believe. <P>so any suggestions on what to build skill with along with the original question. <P>thanks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ebony Blades are awesome as well, tho it will only proc later for you.  Its like a mini yak in my opinion.  stats are 7/24 i think, good combo with a SSoM. They can sell for a s little as 250pp now, maybe less, tho some will try to con you and sell it for 700/800pp since the root/snare fix was implemented. Im on Terris Thule, and will help any rangers there get their SSoM.

</FONT><HR>You have got to be kidding me about the Messenger, right?  I am a 29 Ranger with a Crystalline Blade (11/38) main hand SSoM in offhand and I do decently.  I did the ghoul two levels ago solo and mopped him up.  You guys forget, we are KITE MASTERS.  Get yourself some Magic Arrows (you should be able to make them decently by 20th with Fletching), or just take him on when you are full mana, snare and kite till you run outta arrows/mana and then close in for the kill, full hits against his less than half.  Guys, if you haven't got kiting down yet, you need to go back to Ranger Training.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My Ranger is my first and main char now, so when he was young, he was my only char.  He was twinkless, moneyless, guildless, etc. - I could afford much, so I saved and saved and finally bought a Silvery War Axe for primary hand and a Polished Granite Tomahawk for the off-hand.  That combination worked great for me, and isn't that expensive.  Plus the PGT was my first proccing weap so it was kind of neat to see it proc.<P>Good luck with your decision!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My suggestion for a new weapon would be a Crystal Fiber whip (8 dmg 26 delay).  These can be bought for less than 75pp (as low as 50pp) and is one of the best deals available to a lower ranger.  The whip can be equipped in either hand.<P>Once you get higher in levels, Icetooth's Claws are a good choice (11/29, main hand only, look like claws when equipped).  You will really see the damage start with this weapon.<P>For a 2HS, the Axe of the Iron Back (16/37) is also the best buy for the money (50pp-75pp).<P>At higher levels, you can forget about casting spells during combat, since you will be able to do far more damage with your weapons than any spell.  The one exception is Stinging Swarm (level 30, 100ish DoT), which can be used to pull or at the start of combat.<P>I would stress that you keep your 2HS skill maxed at every level.  At very high levels, dual wield with 2 good weapons is such a taunt that it will get you killed or make you a mana sink for your cleric.  If the warrior tank in your group can't taunt the mobs off you, switch to 2HS.  You still get lots of damage, but th emob won't stay glued to you.<P>Hope this helps.  Despite the problems with the Ranger class, I still think that this is the most fun I have had with any character.<P>Barknes Bearkin<BR>31 Human Ranger of Karana<BR>Saryrn Server<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>If you are keeping your piercing up then you can also look for a Walrus Tooth (6/22 and some stats, maybe 3str and 6 stam)<P>Magechild I do not believe you easily kited the messanger at 27th.  He is 27th and even with kiting your spells would not do enough damage, and your mana would run out.  Please don't lead people to almost certain death by telling them that you took down a mob solo at 27th that you obviously did not.<P>And I do not believe that you were fletching magic arrows at 20th level as that would cost tons of plat that a 20th would not have access to for a long, long time (unless twinked, and if all you have is a SSoM and a Cry Blade then you are not twinked).<P>Get help with the blade but don't pay for help.  I am sure you have some friends that will lend you a hand.  Anyone that takes money to help with a quest like the SSoM should be shot on sight.

</FONT><HR>I started dual wielding Combine longswords at 17, moved up to PGT and a combine not long after. The PGT I got by camping the gnolls, and the Combine longsword is around 55-65pp depending upon your CHA and faction with the gypsies. Both of these weapons are magic so you can hit anything with them. If you don't have a lot of cash, the Combine weapons are a good deal. I saved up for a few levels to be able to buy one of these. I started playing over a year and a half ago and there were a lot less high level people at that time, so the really good weapons weren't affordable or they didn't even exist at that time.<P>If I were to do it now, I would probably get a PGT, just for its proc which can save your life a lot of the time, and get a higher level to help you get the SSoM. A really nice combo for a low level player, and both can be gotten very easily.

</FONT><HR>Sarkus, yes, I easily kited him, and saved and scrimped and planned for that encounter.  I had aproximately a 140 in Fletching when I started making the arrows for that meeting.  I prolly spent 300 plat just making enough arrows so that I was sure I wouldn't run out during the fight. At about 6 pp per group of 10 arrows with an apx 50% success rate, I still managed to make ALOT of magical arrows (you do the math, they trivial at about 182).   I was 27th at the time and didn't have a problem dropping arrows and casting ignite on him while he was snared.  EASILLY took him down to 1/4 life, before I closed in and finished the battle in melee.<P>You SERIOUSLY underestimate the class.  One thing I do is make sure ALL of my casting skills are maxed for my level before I finish my first bub in the level.  That way my spells have the best chance of going off and doing their max damage.  If you don't have a target, use yourself.  After, you have a heal too, don't you?  Just do it someplace you won't get MoB'd at.<P>Admittedly, in a close confines area like Blackburrow or Mistmoore, you are NOT in ideal territory.  You can't kite and if you aren't careful you will have mob's pop in behind and/or beside you while you are fighting something else and *WHACK* you are one dead ranger.  Use your head.  Snare and Flame Lick.  Snare to slow it down, Flame Lick to debuff.  Even if it only drops the AC a couple of points it is worth the minor amount of mana it costs. Tell me how hard you fight to get that extra plat to aquire that piece of rad armor that is only 3 or 4 points higher than the one you have...?<P>If you need money, Farm GLS' in WC and NK...  take them to the Gypsy in Nk and sell the book back to her for 7-9 pp (depending on your faction and CHA)  Make a couple of bows and sell them to newbie players. Hang out in MM at the entrance and solo the very entrance mob's near the zone point.  Cash isn't a problem if you want to do this.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just a quick pointer on weapon selection.<P>After you have maxed your duel wield skill out, you will actually do more damage using a high dmg weapon, like the crystaline swords 11/29 in your offhand, and a fast weapon like the sword of morrin.  This is because you hit less offten with your offhand anyway so the potential to do more damage in one hit is beter than the potential to hit more offten, and you get bonues with you primary so the mnore often you hit the better.<P>Tilian<P>42 Ranger</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Yes, I agree with you Tillian some what.<P>I Have to sets of weps. Speed and Damage.<BR>The speed set. Dragon Horn Yak 8 23 and a SSOY 8 24. My Damage set. Icetooth's Claw & a Crystalized Sword both 11 29.<P>Having mixed these weps up in several combos' I still get the best damage using the 11 29's even though they are slower with no proc. The yaks proc for 75dd.<P>Also as a 40 ranger i use call of sky. This is a self only buff that is a stackable proc. with a 35dd, let me me also mention my skill levels. 1hs, DW, DA are maxed at 200. My pierceing is a 180. The dragon horn is a piercing wep.<P>Over all in a tough fight with a red mob the 11 29's over all will perform better for me. And this is not becuase of my 180 lev. in piercing. But becuase the damage 11 vs 8 is over 30 %higer. <BR>And i get less of the you slash for 1, 5 or 6 etc.<BR>My max damage is 40 with the 11 29's and around 32 to 36 but hit mostly in the 20"s with the yack's<P>Ok, think i said enough..<P>Ruverain 40'th season ranger<BR>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Now I am confused. It would seem to me that a good speed and fairly nice damage would be the way to go in a solo situation or when you need to taunt off the caster. <P>// and when you are in a well balanced group that you can go for a high damage weapon to reduce the agro and since the mob wont last long then you would want to wack him as hard as possible anyway. <P>// Now i must admitt i have been very lack in keeping any other skill other than 1hs maxed. I am currently workin on increasing my piercing and and then i plan to work on my 2hs and 2hb. <P>I find that when working on a skill i try to go for speed over damage am i right in this assumption?? or should i concentrate on damage when working on a weapon skill?? <P>as far as what i am currently using.<P>1.Whip of strangulation in main hand (gave a friend about 250pp for this a good deal i believe)<P>2.dwarven axe in off hand (havnt gotten around to getting a new weapon as i blew my hole stash on the whip)<P>3. and a bronze dagger to increase piercing. <P>also just a side note on High pass. i have gained 110pp in 3days and went from lvl 15 to 20(finally)<BR>in about 4 days here.. is that a good gain?? just want to know.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>thanks in advance </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Best combo I have managed to acquire so far is Revultant whip main hand and briarzephyr offhand, with call of sky on these rock, course you better be buffed good and have a cleric standing behind you, Swarmcaller is almost as much damage and tons less agro, dont get used to dual weild, keep your 2hs and 2hb up, you will want them later.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1) The Walrus Tooth is not wieldable by Rangers.<BR>2) I was fletching magic arrows at 20 easily.  Had made my trueshot in my early 20s as well(at a skill of 135.)   It is completely possible to get that good at fletching at an early stage.<BR>3) I dual wield Icetooth Claws and the Ebony sword 34 now.  Started doing it at 31.  I have not had an excessive agro problem at all.<BR>4) Does it matter if the spells don't do a lot of damage?  If I can slip in an extra 37 hit from my ignite while slashing a way, it helps.  (Especially nice now, that they fixed the weapon counter reset.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The one combo I do not see anyone mentioning is the combo of the Ranger Only weapons, that I know of.  The first being the Sword of Morin (that is mentioned) and what I believe is called the "Orc Slayer) (7/23 Piercing)  The quest is another ranger only quest in LF.

</FONT><HR>Actually Ragnorok,<P>there are MANY MANy better combos for PURE damage at the highest levels that dont include epics hehe. Exquisite Vellium stuff that you can gt pretty easy once your guild starts to farm WW.. ( a quest with the Pirates in WW is pretty easy and they usually gice you an exquisit vellium weapon.. somewhere in the 13/20 or 14/22 range.. <P>I use a Feayguard parrying dagger (9/17 10ac effect word of pain.. yes its AoE but if you use it smart it aint a problem) in my main hand and a Feayguard bladecatcher in the off (thats 10/21 10 ac ).. or if the situation calls for weps that Don;t AoE.. I use a Lupine Dagger (9/18 +4dex +4 str effect Greater wolf_) in main and a Crystalline Short Sword (12/24 +4str +6int +something else i forget) in my off hand. Even at level 57 I switch to 2HS(Swarmcaller 29/41 effect:turgurs) or a Woodsm,an staff (31/33) they are all nice.. for me the first two combos do the MOSt damage. <P>I rmember 2 years ago when i had the same delema... what do i want for my starter weps.. I used an Ashenwood Spear (6/22) ... and a Silvery War axe.. You could get a Dragoon Dirk cheap i think.. OR go with an Axe of iron Back.. <P>SSoM would be UBER nice for you at yur level and maybee you could get someone doing epics or a friend to help you kill it... Also there is another quest for the Orc Impailer,, you WILL eed help with that one though. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

But since we've long gone pas there..<P>Here's my choices, I'm somewhat partial to the Icy Blade (6/21 Shock of Ice proc)/ Kylong hunting knife (9/25 3 str 3 wis) combo..<P>Damage/speed is relatively decent, the process on the blade helps taunt but not excessively.. and the big thing.. almost no weight.. you can swing (er cough poke) these all day long and your stamina will never move :-D<P><BR>Cam<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My preferred choice for dual wield is influenced greatly by me being on a PvP server (Tallon Zek). But the weapons I use are as follows:<P>2h slash<BR>Swarmcaller (29/41 procs 41% slow)<P>Dual Wield<BR>Prim. - 1h Lamentation (9/19 6str 6stam 20hp)<BR>Sec. - (a) Silken Wip of Snaring (14/28 procs snare)<BR>       (b) Club of the Ocean (14/27 3str 10hp procs a 149dd)<P>When dual wielding, I always have the fastest weapon in main hand. In PvP, you need to have the fastest weapon combo possible, but at the same time you need to deal heavy damage, which is why I place high damage dealers in offhand. With the Club or Wip in offhand, I deal up to 50dmg with it.

</FONT><HR>Reasons I don't use Wurmslayer (many ask):<BR>1) When I dual wield, the purpose is fast damage. (wurmslayer is 25/40) If you could use Wurmslayer in the offhand, I would definitely have it in my offhand.<BR>2) If I want to use a weapon that has high damage and high delay of that caliber I will use a 2h slash (ie my Swarmcaller)<BR>3) EVERYONE HAS ONE!
