</FONT><HR>So many silly posts, so many misconceptions about us.  *sigh* <P>For the originator of this thread, I agree with some of the respsonses thus far, in that, you will find it hard to express your faith in any meaningfull (read deep) way through eq.  Cast circle instead, or read the Tarot, but eq will hinder your spiritual connection (too many distractons).  <P>As a practicing witch myself (I am male in RL), and my wife is a practicing Catholic.  She fully supports my practice and I also support hers.  I also find it slightly ironic that I am also a programmer in RL.  We programmers are considered a highly ordered and logical bunch - IMHO - so go fig. *shrug*<P>If however, you wish to express your wiccan belief's in-game, then I suggest that you sit down and create a written history for your druid (that is the most logical choice - wood elf druid) given your stated aim for playing eq.  Role play offers you a lot of possibility to make strides towards your ultimate goal of eq being a "spiritual experience", however, I am reluctant to say it is achievable.<P>I would pick a name that hints at your faith with out stepping on anyone else's toes, like i did with my surname.  Whatever you decide - have fun - that is the entire reason to role play in the first place (whether via a paper/pencil game) or an online game like eq.<P>Merry meet, merry part, merry meet again.<BR>The circle is open, but never broken...<BR>So Mote it be ! :-)<P>Vandaraa De'Vitch <BR>dark elf necromancer of the 35th circle<P>Ride the Flame/<BR>Fear the Dragon/<BR>Forever be  - A <BR>power/ Thee</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

To start, I would recommend the Talk Origins archive.

</FONT><HR>What I dont understand is, why the flip (for censorships sake) do you even care what someone believes? Yes, the christians were wrong for making those posts, but ranting and raving for weeks on end doesnt change a thing. They're still going to feel self-righteous and holier-than-thou no matter how many insults you throw there way. And whatever you believe, you've already convienced yourself that what they say is wrong. Same as they've convienced themselves that you're wrong. Why waste your breath on petty crap (again, censorship) like this when you can be playing EQ!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

(actually low)<P>now there have been billions of humans on the earth.... so we have to assume that multiple combinations will work...<P>I will be VERY generous.... 1/4^(300 million)<P>Ok.... now lets calculate the odds of a star system having a planet which is capable of supporting human life.... incalculable but lets take the figures of the number of planets discovered so far.... last I was counting under 100.... in thousands of known stars close enough to check for planets.... and of those less than one in 10 is in a "biological" zone.<P>so lets see.... one star in ten has a planet.... one planet in 10 can support life (as we know it)... and the odds of life being generated randomly (assuming you can randomly generate DNA, which is possible in a lab with extreme effort) is 1/4^300,000,000...<P>oh and assume that 2/3 of the planets are made by second or later generation stars (otherwise the stellar nucleosynthsis has not happened so there are no elements higher than iron, which would preclude life as we know it)<P>2 planets in 300 stars then can support life... or 1 in 150.... times a number so small my P-3 450 is still chugging on trying to calculate it after several minutes.<P>And then this calculation would result in one species. Not millions.<P>Tell me again how many stars there are in you universe? cause we now have to divide that number by 150 (stars not supporting life) times 1/4^(300 million) times 10,000 (here i am giving you another break in the odds by assuming that even though there are millions of species, most of them aren't aren't as complex as humans, even though many of them are, if not more complex)<P>Wake up, infinity is NOT a number. There are not and cannot be an INFINITE number of stars. And nothing is INFINITELY improbable. But at some point reasonableness must be applied.<P>Assumption #1: It is highly unlikely for life to begin randomly.<P>Assumption #2: It is possible there is another answer to the question "How did life evolve?"<P>Mathmatics isn't going to solve the question of "is there a god" any more than chemisty is going to solve the question of "why did Julia Roberts marry Lyle Lovett"<P>We could just be a cosmic accident. I believe that is less likely than the existance of a higher power. At some point you must have heard of Pascal's bet. Do the anaylasis based on that. And on the number of times you have thrown a quarter up in the air to call heads or tails and the other guy called "side" <P><BR>This person is an idiot. that is the chances of a human popping out of the ocean, like us.<P>now, for a barely-alive once cell miotic organism that can just hardly reproduce, its probally much much more likely for life to appear<P>A study was conducted, that showed that the conditions on primitive earth COULD create ammino acids and protiens essential for life. <P>and with billions of stars, and trillions of planets, its impossible for this not to happen<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

WHY DEBATE ON RELIGION IN A GAMEPLAY FORUM? its out of place, pure and simple. Now if you were debating on game mechanics in reguards to things like: why so many innoruk followers are KOS to certain cities, then I could understand, but the Judo-Christian gods and the Pagan gods and whatever other religions that have been discussed that belong to OUR plane of existance have NO place in EQ nor do they have place on this forum.

</FONT><HR>Valmordian:<P>I read the document by the learned professor.<P>It proves MY point.<P>You see... in MATH if you keep taking GOOD probabilities and multiplying them... you very very quickly get BAD probabilities.<P>2/3 to the third power is less than one in 10.<P>Also it FAILS COMPLETELY to address the Chaos theory or the laws of thermodynamics. One does NOT generate more ordered systems without outside intervention.<P>The Sears tower is VASTLY less complex than the human system is biologically.  If you dropped the components from the sky over and over how quickly would you expect them to form the exact structure or something close?<P>To the person who quoted me in entirety, first don't do that, it's a waste of bandwidth. And you simply state that "in an infinite universe with infinite time everything is possible".<P>1) The Universe isn't infinite.<BR>2) Time isn't infinite.<BR>3) Infinity is a mathmatical concept NOT a number.<P>My statement was, is and remains that some things are SO unlikely as to be completely improbable. In such cases Ocam's Razor must be applied. Logic. As an atheist you can cling to nothing else but logic. You must accept the simpler and more likely solution.<P>If you believe that it's all random chance... then simply answer my test of faith.<P>Flip a nickel into the air and call "sides". Good luck, and I hope you brought lunch and dinner... cause you are going to be flipping that nickel for quite a while.<P>I believe in science. I believe in logic. And I believe in a higher power. I find NO dichotomy in those statements.<P>For those unfamiliar with it I will restate Pascal's bet. Pascal (one of them) was asked how he would bet his money on the question of "does god exist?"<P>He ruled that by logic there could only be two possibilities.<P>1) There is no god.<P>2) There is a god.<P>And that there are only two ways to believe (bet)<P>A) Not believe in god.<P>B) Believe in god.<P>Then the outcomes.<P>1) A) No god, no belief, no gain.<BR>1) B) No god, belief, no loss.<BR>2) A) god, no belief, Loss.<BR>2) B) god, belief, Gain.<P>Doesn't take a freaking genius to gather his conclusion. You LOSE nothing if you believe in a god that does NOT exist. You LOSE everything if you disbelieve in a god that does exist. You gain everything if you believe in a god that exists.<P>Even Pascal didn't try to figure how to bet as to which religion is the right one. <P>I have nothing against anyone's religion. Worship who, what, when, where, how and why you want. But to be athiest seems like the most foolish of all. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

(we don't follow the health and dietary guidelines and barely follow the sexual and moral ones [ten commandments] in practice)<P>4) the Catholic church has recently (in the last few decades) become much more open to alternitive (in their eyes) religions. The dali lama and several American Indian and other religions personages have been meeting with the pope for a long time.<P>Check your facts. Don't make assumptions.

</FONT><HR>&gt; Also it FAILS COMPLETELY to address the Chaos<BR>&gt; theory or the laws of thermodynamics. One does<BR>&gt; NOT generate more ordered systems without<BR>&gt; outside intervention.<P>The second sentence is commonly stated by pro-evolutionists, but it is a misunderstanding of what that law means.  It's trivial to gain order in one area at the expense of overall order (which is to say, on a universal scale.)  Your air conditioning works in this way.  So, too, does evolution.<P>Anyone, creationist or biologist, who studies evolution without studying computer scientist issues of neural networks, gradient descent, simulated annealing, etc. just won't have a proper grasp on what's going on.  There is nothing magical here, nor something that violates a misunderstood law of thermodynamics.<P><BR>&gt; The Sears tower is VASTLY less complex than the<BR>&gt; human system is biologically. If you dropped the<BR>&gt; components from the sky over and over how<BR>&gt; quickly would you expect them to form the exact<BR>&gt; structure or something close?<P>You wouldn't, but that's not how evolution works.  It is NOT pure random combinations of molecules that produces life.  The toughest part of life forming is the part about self-replication.  After that, randomness plays little (see above re: simulated annealing) in continued evolution.  But with trillions of molecules in a drop of water, and uncounted drops on uncounted planets, with hellishly long periods of time to wait, yes, it will happen eventually.  Probably many, many times over, in fact.  And there's good evidence that it may only NEED to happen once, with sizeable impacts capable of knocking intact molecules, or even one-celled organisms, off one world onto another while embedded inside cracks on rocks.<P>One of the most irritating issues is that evolution is NOT in discord with the bible.  That's a falsehood generated by various religious leaders to get their flocks to hate this or that thing -- standard redirect-the-hatred stuff used throughout history.<P><BR>Regarding Pascal's bet, here's another way to look at it:<P>1. No god, no belief - gain, you've gained a much better life, enjoying it more<BR>2. No god, belief - you've wasted your life (see #1.)<BR>3. God, no belief - Personally, I will destroy god in a logic debate over this.  The concept of an omnipotent god who is benevolent is inconsistant with the reality I observe.  I will not partake in any experiments on moral behavior by such a being, and will certainly not kneel to such.  Oh, such a god could force me down, the way a terrorist or dictator might force me to praise them and do what they say, but it would be a sham.  Praise god.<BR>4. God, belief - Will never happen (see reasons for 3.)  But if it did, what would I gain?  An eternity knowing I participated in a god and his flawed morals system?  I am sorry, but I am far too intelligent to believe otherwise.  I do not subscribe to things so complex that "man cannot understand" or "man was not meant to know."  Please, I would LOVE to see a chain of reasoning that arrives at this world that is 1. proper reasoning and 100% moral and 2. causes me to go insane, or is so complex I cannot understand it.  Please.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Regarding "witch" and "poisoner", they had better check their bibles.  I don't argue the point, but if THEY believe in their king james bible, that it is the translated (by inspiration by god) word of god, then, by god, when it says witch, it means witch.  Many other translations do this, too, so they must all be wrong (a point I joyously accept.  No god = bible made up all along, not just the translations "guided" by god.)<P>In any event, I reiterate, if they believe their translation was guided by god, and it says witch, then your defense that it is really "poisoner" doesn't apply -- indeed, to them, you are a heretic for even suggesting it isn't "witch"!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>i do agree that this thread doesnt belong here but i would like to thank all because i found it thoroughly enjoying to read, it is not often i can hear/read such well thought out posts of conflicting views<P>i do have one question though:<P>If there is a higher power and there is a religion believing in this higher power, why have the writtings and new teachings of this higher power stopped? <P>With the change in human's way of living in the last 2000 years, the holy books of religion havent changed.  Is this to say that these books were flawlessly written and do not need to change with the changes in humanity?<P>We are not the same as we were 2000-1500 years ago</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042470-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/042470.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=042470&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=042470&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
