</FONT><HR>We apologize for the previous Shaman thread going corrupt, Alan was still able to read a great deal of your input before it disappeared... so we will try to continue the discussion here, sorry for the inconvenience... ~Akriss<P><BR>You can read the previous discussion here:http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/042820.html<BR>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045780.html<BR>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055973.html<P>Author Topic: Shaman Talk… <BR>Absor<BR>Station Member posted 12-20-2000 02:37 PM <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Hi everyone,<BR>I've taken a bunch of topics out of various posts and cobbled together this monster. I ended up not getting the names of the original posters, I hope you can forgive me if I don't attribute your posts or your ideas. I guess I'm more interested in addressing the ideas than giving credit…<P>First, some news about a few things:<P>1) Despite what I previously wrote about our satisfaction with the 55th level pet spell, we are still looking at it. I'm not promising any changes. But the debate continues…<P>2) The Rage Line: All the spells in the line should be working along the same lines as Rage now. But we did find an error. Fury was (is) giving a dex debuff instead of a dex buff. That should be fixed with our next patch (though there is no date set for a patch yet). There were some stacking issues to consider. We've looked them over, and they are working the way they should work. So, yes, it does overwrite some stat buffs and not others. That's the way it's going to stay. Changing anything about the way they stack would undoubtedly cause other stacking issues, and nobody wants that. <P>Ok, on to the various post snips. Keep in mind that this is sort of a first run through. You're getting my ideas and comments here, not company policy. I'm trying to get my ducks in a row so that I can present cogent ideas to the team.<P>&gt;"Icons for group disease and poison buff - when applied, the icon appears exactly the same as if you are poisoned or diseased, would it be possible to tint the icons blue so people know its a buff and not a dot. This also applies for the druid group resist fire and cold."<P>Actually, I think a lot of icons probably need to be redone. It's something that I really would like to see get a revamp. But, really, this isn't a Shaman thing, it's something that everyone would probably like. I'm not ignoring this idea, just moving it off this thread and into my want list.<P>&gt;"Alchemy - 2 things<P>1) NPC merchants will only buy back potions for between 9 gold and 2 plat, regardless of the cost to make the potion. Could this be made more in line with jewlry, maybe were merchants can buy back potions for 80 - 90% of the cost. Currently, the cost of practicing is enormious with no chance of profit in the end. I spent 2500 pp to practice the other day, and went from a skill of 50 to 90, to practice above this level will cost between 15pp - 200pp per attempt."<P>I'll ask into it. But keep in mind that trade skills are designed to only be profitable when items are sold to players. But if the return isn't at least reasonable when selling to vendors, I'll see if I can find out why.<P>&gt;"2) Currently only SOW potions have any demand at all, and occasionaly gate potions if people can afford them (cheaper to pay a druid or wizard). Could new gate potions be added to the new expansions zones?"<P>I'll look into it. But my first thought is that Velious is designed to be hard to get to, so that's unlikely. And, well, it might not be the intent of Alchemy to reduce the need to have a wizard or druid to zap you around the globe.<P>&gt;"Torpor – Doesn’t stack with chloroplast/regrowth, spirit of wolf, Turgur’s Insects, Ignite Blood, Plague, Celestial Elixer. None of these cases make sense except for SoW. We are not asking for Torpor to cancel DOTs, just stack with them, as well as CE and regen. In addition this spell hardly compares to other class Lvl 60 spells, with only 1200 hp total heal and all the negative effects, feel free to make it useful."<P>Well, stacking regens is always going to be very limited. And it makes some sense to me that you can't go into torpor while under a DoT. It's a lot of healing for little mana. It greatly reduces downtime. Personally, I think it's fine as is. But feel free to try to convince me otherwise.<P>&gt;"Avatar – Does not stack with Focus of Spirit and Wolf Form. Even if you want to make some of the components (str for example) not stack please make the overall buff and non-redundant parts of these stack. This is not the main problem however, which is that for 325 mana, a 1 minute duration and a 3 minute recast, with quite questionable benefits (for example this is not anywhere near what 70% haste spells do), shamans do not use this spell at all."<P>Again, it seems like a great spell to me. Perhaps others can wade in here and explain to me why this isn't a good spell. Keep in mind that stacking is a very complicated issue.<P>&gt;"Talisman of the Serpent – Most shamans consider this spell nothing less than an insult. Please just remove it. If you are feeling generous replace it with something a little more useful, a group Talisman of Kragg would be OK."<P>Not all spells will be 'A' list spells. There's no real reason to remove this spell. Heck, if you're playing with a lot of bards…<P>&gt;"Stacking of Curse of Spirits, effect on epic weapon Spear of Fate- Splurt, Choke, Ignite Blood all overwrite it. It does not take on someone with Skin Like Nature series buff on. These are all obviously oversights on your part please correct."<P>I'll look into it and see if these are, in fact, oversights or if they are as intended. It's not so obvious to me…<P>&gt;"Tigir’s Insects – Range of the area effect is pretty darned small. As this spell is so rare most shamans don’t have it yet to complain about this, but they will."<P>Well, there are a fair number of spells with a very small area of effect. It takes a bit of skill to land on a lot of targets, but it can be done. Keep in mind that monsters don’t have much, er… volume, so they can be stacked very close together. This doesn't seem like something that needs to be changed.<P>&gt;"It's pretty obvious from the original spell listing that shamans were designed as a generalist priest class with the following features: <BR>1. Buffs far beyond any other class<BR>2. Debuffing abilities somewhat better than an enchanter.<BR>3. Second-tier healing. Similar to druids in straight heals, with regeneration spells to help.<BR>4. Strong, but limited (only two) Damage over Time lines.<BR>5. Use of a second-tier pet at higher level<BR>6. Slightly better melee skills than the other priests. <BR>Sound about right?"<P>Sounds right to me, for the most part. I have a disagreement with point #2, but I'll get to that in a second.<P>&gt;"On the face, it sounds like a good plan. The realities of play at level 50 had some interesting effects: <BR>1. Stats were never implemented in a manner to make stat buffs overly useful. The ratio of their effect to mana expendature make them iffy to use in a lot of circumstances. The lines of buffs that did really matter (AC, HP, melee speed) were done better by clerics, and about equivalently to enchanters."<P>And later you mentioned something about buffs not being mana efficient either. Honestly, mana efficiency isn't the end-all and be-all of determining the value of a class. It's a consideration, but it's not the only thing that matters. The ability to do something that is useful might fully overpower the idea that you can't do it efficiently. Tell me if I'm wrong here, but shaman do have the most efficient buffs (with perhaps the noted exception of AC and HP by clerics and attack speed by enchanters). You must be comparing efficiently, I guess, to just blasting things. Keep in mind, though, that blasting things may not always be an option. Buffing the melee types in some cases might be more efficient.<P>But I'm willing to accept your comments as they are, even if I might not believe in them as strongly as you do.<P>&gt;"2. This worked pretty much as planned. Enchanters did most of our abilities at a slightly lower level, and mages could do resist debuffing at a lower level of effectiveness."<P>Actually, I had always thought that enchanters were supposed to be the masters of debuffing. For me, the current setup seems just right on this account.<P>&gt;"3. Worked as planned.<BR>4. Worked as planned, but got hit by a nerf aimed to stop kiting, which was never our forte anyway."<P>Good enough.<P>&gt;"5. Went okay here. The only real problem was our pet got hit by some changes aimed at reigning in the power of the pets that WERE problematic, namely necro and mage pets."<P>Goodness, pets again! <P>But, essentially, pets for shaman work as intended, right? They add a bit of damage and tanking, and they look cool.<P>&gt;"6. True, but largely irrelevant since at higher levels, necessity really dictates the higher efficiency of medding over melee in most situations, and we were never close in combat effectiveness anyway."<P>But not at all irrelevant to those in the level to use it. The ability for a shaman to melee pretty well makes the earlier levels a fairly easy go for them. Again, I think this works out well enough.<P>&gt;"So we got hit by a couple nerfs aimed at others, and the "king of buffs" title was both misleading and largely useless, but all in all, it was a good class. What happened with Kunark? Well, look at the spell list as a whole: <P>1. We got a TON of buffs. All 5 stats get a bigger version AND all 5 get group versions. About a third of the RoK spell list is buffs."<P>I gather you disagree with the continuance of buffs as the main focus of shaman. I think I understand this, and I'll bring it to the team. Don't, however, expect a revamp of all the spells post 50. It's not very likely that we'll be suddenly changing all buffs to DD spells or something wild like that. As you stated, up to 50 shamans are pretty darn great. I'm of the opinion that buffs are part of that greatness. But I think I see what you're getting at.<P>&gt;"2. Nice slow upgrade at 51, with still a slim lead over enchanters, but the Mage Mala line is much closer to our Malo than previously. In fact, from 51 to 59, mages have the same single-target debuff spell as shamans."<P>I guess this means that you're ok with the progression, and just upset that magicians have gained that type of spell. I'm not a big fan of the spreading of abilities over classes either.<P>&gt;"3. Worked okay. We got superior heal finally, as well as Regrowth and Torpor (once in its current version) to help. Fizzle rates are insane on superior heal, but the design idea was right."<P>All 'secondary' powerful spells like that have a bit more fizzle to them. You're not alone in that. And it is, frankly, just another drawback to the spell. Personally, I'm not sure that shaman should have superior healing… it's not unlike giving mages Malosi…<P>&gt;"4. Necros get our prized #1 DoT spell (Envenomed Bolt) at 51, then several upgrades. Druids get two DoT upgrades by 54. Shamans don't get their DoT updates -- and somewhat disappointing ones -- at 56 and 59!"<P>Confusion! You don't get he upgrades at all, or you're disappointed with them…<P>I looked it up. They seem to be there. In fact, here's what Everlore says about Pox of Bertoxxulous:<P>"This is believed to be the best DoT in game. It is the last Shaman DoT, doing close to 2100 damage."<P>Not that I hold everything on spoiler sites to be the gospel truth… <P>Please, give me some detail as to why these upgrades are disappointing.<P>&gt;"5. The pet upgrade is only minimally better than the 49 pet while hitting a HUGE cost increase. Our second-tier pet actually becomes third-tier as by level 60, Shadowknights have better pets."<P>I know… I know. We're still looking into this one.<P>&gt;"Now, as I mentioned, at 50 shamans were a pretty strong class, and it's probably true that a slight cut in overall power relative to the other classes wasn't out of line. But virtually every defining factor of the class was given a terribly minor update, save one. And, in a lot of cases, we were matched or surpassed by other classes in areas we'd been the specialists in."<P>I disagree with the minor update thing. And, well, if you agree that shaman were perhaps on the top few rungs at 50, then how else would you suggest we upgrade them?<P>&gt;"The one that takes up over a third of our spell list: buffs. <BR>It's really puzzling. One gets the feeling that the live team doesn't really quite grasp the role of the shaman in high level play, and although they think they're giving us key improvements in our major areas, we see them as near-worthless toss-ins that add to the pile of low-value spells that take the place that more interesting or useful spells could go. What's more, impinging on our REAL defining abilities by other classes is okay because they're not viewed by the design team as being shaman core abilities."<P>It seems that it's worthwhile to have a talk about stat buffs in house. But, well, I'm not convinced that they rate as… how did you put it… near-worthless. As for giving out core abilities to other classes, well, I don't like that either. It's always a fine line, though, between making classes playable and keeping things distinct for them as well. This is something that I also want to bring up to the team.<P>&gt;"A prime example of this would be the abilities of the class breastplates. In Kunark, the shaman BP casts a damage shield. This is really puzzling since apart from alchemy, we don't have damage shields, and the damage from it (5 points) is tiny... the real effect is the AC buff it provides. In Velious, the shaman BP casts a stamina buff. While not totally useless, it's hardly what we'd expect, when comparing our effects to say that of clerics (who get Complete Heal and Celestial Elixir)."<P>I don't want to make this into an item discussion… I really think those sorts of things are best served in a different thread. But I'll mention this to the team as well.<P>&gt;"I'm not talking about the strength of the spells. It's that the clerics (and other casting classes) seem to be getting spells that are central to their function in game -- primary healing. Whereas an ac buff+damage shield and stamina buff seem to say a shaman's primary function is to buff. When it's not true at all -- our primary function is generally to DEBUFF. More appropriate spells would be things like Turgur's Insects, Malosi, or Cripple."<P>Well, this seems to be where you and I depart philosophy. Maybe it's just me, I don't know. The damage shield obviously isn't part of your core function as a shaman. But buffing really is. Debuffing is a secondary thing. But, as I've said, I'll talk this over with the team. Contrary to popular belief, we do have people that play shaman on the team…<P>&gt;"I think this is the primary obstacle between the designers and players -- as far as the players are concerned, shamans just aren't there to buff. We may do it, but it's not why we're needed in the high level game, and it's not our major contribution to the group. With the game mechanics as they are, this is not likely to change. What DOES need re-evaluating is the priority that function is given when designing shaman spell lists and assigning appropriate effects to class-specific items."<P>Again, perhaps… Buffing is certainly something that is a primary focus at lower levels. Obviously, as you've stated, you think that focus changes post 50. And, again, I'll talk to the team about it.<P>Wow. I'm sorry this thing ran so long. I'm just probing for ideas and clarifications, and letting you know where I stand and what I think. Feel free to try to change my mind. It doesn't really seem that, reading over all the threads, there is all that much that you're unhappy with. I guess I'm a bit shocked to see so many posts about shamans lately…<P>Alan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Since I haven't seen Tugg reiterate his concerns, I thought I'd post his commentary, because it is the best summarization that I've seen regarding Shaman issues.<P>1. Torpor.<P>I appreciate what you have done so far for Torpor but I would really like to see this spell become a staple at level 60. While I do not mind casting it on MYSELF for an efficient heal, party and guild members tell me not to cast it on them. This is the level 60 ultimate Shaman heal, folks. Please don't dink around here. I can live with the slow component because it fits in line<BR>with the name "Torpor", as well as it is only a temporary effect. But everyone I cast it on HATES BEING SNARED. They tell me not to cast Torpor on<BR>them. The snare component is unnecessary and only serves to nerf the spell for some unknown reason. Clerics have huge regen spells with NO side<BR>effects. Shaman have been casting regen spells the longest. Shaman are supposed to be the clerical equivalent for the undeveloped races. I would like the snare component removed. That would also mean the spell wouldn't need to be group only. Which would make it valuable on raids as well as xp groups. Also with the recent changes to resurrection effects, by adding the<BR>haste debuff Torpor no longer works to heal the freshly resurrected.<P>2. Avatar<P>This spell really gets my goat. It has massive stacking problems, it's *INFERIOR* to a level 44 Enchanter buff, and it's WAY too expensive both in<BR>mana and pp cost. The end result? In both raid and XP group scenarios Boon of Garou is the melee buff cast.<P>Boon of Garou<BR>Level: 44 Enchanter spell<BR>Mana: 100<BR>Component: None<BR>Duration: 6 minutes<BR>Recast time: 3 minutes<BR>Effects: Werewolf Illusion, +40 ATK, +100 Dex, and gives a 37 pt lifetap proc.<P>Avatar<BR>Level: 60 Shaman spell<BR>Mana: 325<BR>Component: Emerald (~13-22pp)<BR>Duration: 6 minutes<BR>Recast time: 3 minutes<BR>Effects: +100 Strength, +100 Dex, +100 ATK, +100 AGI<BR>Stacking problems: MASSIVE<P>Let's compare these 2 spells. The enchanter spell is MUCH cheaper and requires no component. The enchanter spell also has a "wow, cool!" effect<BR>because of the werewolf component while the Shaman "wow, cool!" component - growth - was nerfed and removed. As to a comparison of spell abilities, they are both equal in the +DEX department. Not to mention a unique SHAMAN<BR>ability was stolen to give Enchanters this spell - the ability to buff dexterity, especially by 100 points? Come on guys. The Shaman spell adds 100<BR>Strength which is really quite useles for 2 reasons. First, by the time a melee is high enough level to have this buff cast on them they are already operating near maxxed (255) str. Also, there are dwindling returns on stats<BR>past 200 anyway. So what's the point? It's nothing but a "gee whiz, golly that's neat" component. But it doesnt DO ANYTHING WORTHWHILE. +100 Agility has at least some defensive value; a high level melee will gain 1 AC per 5 points of AGI once they are past the hump at 75 agi.<P>I trust you are getting my point here? Avatar is BROKEN and NEVER CAST. I suggest you eliminate the stacking problems with Avatar, remove the emerald component, and lower the mana required to 150. Put the growth factor back in or put some sort of "aura" around someone while they are under the effects of Avatar.<P>3. Pet<P>L34 Pet - 350 Mana<BR>L39 Pet - 400 Mana<BR>L44 Pet - 450 Mana<BR>L49 Pet - 500 Mana<BR>L55 Pet - 850 Mana<P>What's wrong with this pattern? First off, we were getting a new pet every 5 levels. We get the pet a level late and no 59th pet with Kunark. I would like to see the 55 pet moved to 54, and a new pet at 59 introduced. Second, look at the mana required for each pet. Why the HUGE boost in mana necessary? Necro's 49th pet is 490 mana, and their 59th pet is 690. I know they have complaints about its performance, but at least it's a cool spectre to wow noobs, and it is reasonably in-line in efficiency with their other<BR>pets for mana required. Likewise the 49th Enchanter pet is 300 mana, and their 55th pet is only 350 mana. The 49th Mage earth pet is 200 mana, and their 57th earth pet is oddly 400. Perhaps their 57 pet needs re-tuning also, but it is still very cheap to cast for something that can kill most high level melees. The 49th Shaman pet is 500 mana and the 55th one is 850. Our pet will never come close to the damage of true pet classes pets due to the lack of dual weild and lower level. You could make our pet do 75 damage<BR>a bite max and a quadding high level pet class pet could still smear the ground with jebeker guts. We AREN'T asking to become pet class gods. We ARE asking for reasonable compensation for this huge mana inflation.<P>Some cool ideas to fix the 55 pet would be:<P>* Use dire wolf model when we summon our pet in Velious<BR>* Make the highest pet blue to us at the level we get it or at least up the level a couple notches. What use is 51 dmg/attack when the pet can't hit<BR>anything because it is 15-20 levels lower then the target?<BR>* Up the maximum damage.<BR>* Summon a physically larger pet increasing with pet's power (like mage pets).<BR>* Move the 55th pet to 54 and add a second one at 59<BR>* Reduce the mana required for the 55 pet to 650.<BR>* Make the minimum pet level higher then it is now.<P>I'm not asking for ALL of this. These are just SOME suggestions of the way to improve the 55 shaman pet. Shaman really mess their pet guys.<P><BR>4. Stacking problems.<P>Focus of the Spirit has massive stacking problems. First of all, because of the dumb negative stat side effects of resist potions I can't cast this buff on people during Trakanon, Wuoshi, and Severilous raids. The -STR component<BR>of Greater Purity potions won't take hold with Focus on the target. Since Resists &gt; ALL ELSE during raids of this type, I have to give everyone the inferior Talisman of Kragg. Come on guys, this is a level 60 buff. We shouldn't have to nickel and dime. Either fix stacking problems or remove the negative side effects from the Alchemy potions.<P>Additionally, I can't even cast Focus on MYSELF because then I will lose Voice of the Berserker. I would really love to cast Focus on myself, it<BR>lasts 100 minutes and is a more efficient HP buff then Kragg. However, the str/dex components of it or of Voice of the Berserker force me to choose<BR>between the two of them. WHY? These are level 60 and 59 spells respectively.<P>Avatar also has serious stacking issues.<P>I suggest you allow stat effects to stack. They cap at 255 anyway.<BR>Just say:<P>if (str+item1+item2+buff1+buff2) &gt; 255 then effective_str=255;<P>Torpor has massive stacking problems.<P>5. Superior Fizzle<P>The fizzle rate is a joke. I am a level 60 Shaman with maxxed alteration and I specialize in alteration and on a DAILY basis I fizzle away up to half a bubble of mana trying to cast Superior Heal ONE TIME. I suggest Superior Heal be moved to 49 and the accompanying fizzles be reduced to a more reasonable rate. Torpor has the same fizzle problems. I would expect SOME fizzle due to it being a level 60 spell but not the rate at which it currently fizzles.<P>Likewise, I fizzle Cannibilize III up to 5-6 times in a row sometimes. Don't believe me? I will post screenshots. Again, this is a DAILY occurance. Something is "WRONG" with post 50 Alteration spells fizzle rates.<P>6. Statbuffs need to be effective and worth casting.<P>It's been parsed and we understand what stats do. We also understand for the mana expended, they are JUNK compared to a haste buff. They equate to<BR>nothing but a placebo for most occasions.<P>Strength:<BR>Most melee classes want strength because it increases their maximum damage and they think "Gee golly this is great!". Well, to the Shaman who has to cast and keep STR buffs up on 15 melee characters it is a waste of time,<BR>resources, and the raid is being slowed down to give out a placebo confidence boost. Here is why: Strength only increases the MAXIMUM damage,<BR>it does not increase the "magic number". Every weapon has a "magic number". If you parse enough logs and total the number of times you hit a target, you will notice one damage point hits far more times then any other number. This is called the magic number. If strength were to effect the magic number in such a way that the AVERAGE hit was for more damage, it would be useful.<BR>Since it does not, it is merely eye-candy (like crits) and a placebo effect for any melee that is not a flying kick or backstab type. Let me illustrate:<P>5 Damage weapon<BR>Magic number: 2*5=10<BR>The majority of hits by this hypothetical 5 base damage weapon will be for 10 points of damage (the magic number). The player may also do a few extra points of damage over and above the magic number, depending on str, level, skill among other things.<P>Let's say the maximum damage you can hit for with this hypothetical 5dmg weapon without being str buffed is 14 points. If we represent 14 points of<BR>damage with asterisks it would look like this (one * per 1 point dmg):<BR>[**************]<P>Occasionally, due to a strength buff the player MIGHT hit for an additional 1 or 2 points damage.<BR>[***************]<P>All the strength buff adds is "*". SOMETIMES. Compare that to the mana required for a haste buff, which can increase attack speed 50, 60, even 70% and you can see how truly useless it is to cast strength when you can cast haste.<P>Strength of course also allows you to carry more weight, and it seems to have the effect that if your weapons skill is not maxxed it makes up for<BR>that defficiency and allows you to hit almost or as hard as if your weapon skill was maxxed. For more info on strength buffs check this post out:<BR>http://forums.eqforge.com/shaman/showthread.php3?threadid=3678<P>Agility:<BR>Agility is an easy one to figure out. If you have less than 75 Agility, you will take a severe AC hit. Thus most players will want to keep at least 75 agility at all times. Past the 75 Agility "hump", there are only 2 benefits<BR>given by an agility buff. You will gain 1AC per 5 points of Agility buff. Thus a 100 point Agility buff would give 20 points of AC which would<BR>theoretically be a good thing if not for the massive stacking problems of Avatar!! Two, agility helps increase the speed at which defensive skills (like defense, dodge) are raised. Other then that agility has no real value.<P>Dexterity:<BR>I lost the link to the thread but an old Shaman posted their results of testing Dexterity to be not really worth casting. They had found for every<BR>10 points of dexterity buffed, .05% or .5% increased chance of proccing occured (again, going from memory here). So let's say you buffed someone's dexterity and they have an additional 5% chance to proc. It's not additive. That doesnt mean if you already have a 5% chance to proc this will increase that chance to 10%. It means you will gain 5% of 5% additional chance to<BR>proc. This really doesn't seem worth buffing under most circumstances. The other effect is offensive melee skills are learned faster (1hb, 2hb, 1hs, 2hs, piercing, offense, etc).<P>Stamina:<BR>This is probably the only stat I don't gripe about buffing or needing to be buffed. More stamina equals more hitpoints, and everyone needs extra hitpoints to stay alive. Stamina=good, nuff said.<P>With the effectiveness of these stats above known, the veil of ignorance concerning them has been lifted from most high level players who instead opt for Haste, AC, Hitpoints, and resists. Fully a 33% of Shamans spells are<BR>stat buffs and largely considered useless or undesirable by a LOT of knowledgeable players. If they were given good reasons to have, this 33% of<BR>spells the Shaman has would become useful. As a final closer on stat buffs I want to ask you if the effect of something is so small that logs have to be parsed to determine its usefulness, is it really all that useful?<P>7. Comments about specific spells or drop rates<P>L50 Spirit Quickening - This is a nice concept spell but is there ANY way we can up the duration? It seems to wear off after every 5-6 minutes and is incredibly annoying to keep buffed on a pet. Adjust the mana cost if you have to but make it last at least 30 min.<P>L52 Spirit of Scale - This spell is junk just like its single target counterpart. I could undertand altering it so if the PLAYER cast any spell it would drop, but if a MOB casts on you (and a LOT of them do, and a lot MORE of them will because you can't invis yourself after you get it on you!) the spell drops. This should be changed for both versions. It shouldn't drop<BR>unless the effect wears off or the player casts a spell.<P>L53 Superior Heal - Aka Superior Fizzle. Please look into the fizzle rate.<P>L54 Cannibilize III - Suffers the same fizzle rate as Superior Heal.<P>L54 Ice Strike - Shaman aren't nukers but we were expecting a 725-750pt Ice<BR>nuke here.<P>L55 Spirit of the Howler - Lots of pet problems. Discussed elsewhere in this post.<P>L55 Torrent of Poison - Suffers the AE "bug by design". Why are pets considered as targets (and thus waste a wave of effects) on NON PVP servers?<P>L56 Bane of Nife - This drops off Sebilite Juggernauts among other things, but it really should be vendor purchaseable. A shaman's main offensive power comes from his DOTS, of which he gets to buy none of in the Kunark Expansion<BR>because they are all drops! Even Druid dots are vendor purchaseable.<P>L57 Talisman of the Brute - Probably the only group stat buff worth casting as it's a group hp buff. However, it suffers the same problems as all the other group statbuffs which are documented elsewhere in this post.<P>L57 Talisman of the Cat - Probably the second most useful group stat buff due to being a stackable group AC buff. Also suffers the same problems as group statbuff spells.<P>L58 Talisman of the Rhino - Incredibly useless spell. Why would anyone want +42 strength when they could have +68?<P>L58 Talisman of the Serpent - No other uses besides giving group CHA buffs to buy keys in Sky.<P>L58 Tigir's Insects - INCREDIBLY RARE DROP. There are 1 or 2 on all of Prexus..10 months after Kunark's release. Is this intended? It's not even an overpowering spell..it's just a useful one for train type situations. I really don't think the spell power warrants the super low drop rate. Please up it. I am a level 60 Shaman and this is my only missing spell.<P>L59 Pox of Bertoxx - Also incredibly rare. It only drops off Guardian Wurms in SF/VP and uber L60 mobs.<P>L59 Talisman of the Raptor - Incredibly rare drop, also incredibly junky. Again, if someone wants dex, why settle for this lower powered version when our single target version is available?<P>L59 Voice of the Berserker - Won't stack with Focus, PLEASE FIX. Also please up the duration to an hour and adjust the mana cost if you have to, it's extremely annoying having this thing wear out on me every half hour.<P>L60 Avatar - MASSIVE stacking problems, too expensive to cast in mana and pp. Discussed elsewhere, please fix.<P>L60 Focus of Spirit - Stacking problems with Alchemy resist potions and the rage/Voice of the Berserker self only buff line. Focus also doesn't stack with the Monk's whistling robe effect, and they get mad when I buff them with our L60 buff. Yay! Please fix these stacking problems.<P>L60 Torpor - Discussed elsewhere in this post.<P>NEW SPELL SUGGESTION:<BR>Focus of the Defender<BR>L60, Single target buff costs 275 mana. Gives stackable 250HP, 12AC, 40AGI, and 40STA buff.<BR>Stackable with Focus of Spirit, Avatar, Voice of the Berserker line. Should be able to be cast on INT caster without overwriting their shielding<BR>line of spells.<P>8. Group stat buffs not worth casting.<P>Our group stat buffs need to be looked at. They need to give the effects of the best single target version and cost twice as much mana.<P>L57 Talisman of the Brute should cast Riotous Health on all party members in range for 300 mana and have a duration of 1 hour.<P>Please keep in mind except for Talisman of the Brute and Cat, the group buffs are EXTREMELY situational. If I cast Talisman of the Rhino (group str), maybe 2 or 3 members are going to need the effects because they were melees or overloaded. The other members are going to be MAD at me for wasting a valuable buff slot. ESPECIALLY ENCHANTERS. Most of them use the<BR>Bedlam line as a absorptive shield and they can't when I str buff them. Group buffs should also be able to be turned off by players at will just like they can with SOW and levitate.<P>9. Uber Velious mob resists.<P>One would think with the increased melee damage output of Velious mobs, Shaman would be higher in demand to land speed debuffs. However just about<BR>every uber Velious mob I've run into resists or is COMPLETELY IMMUNE from a Shaman's slow - even after landing Malo. Dain Frostreaver, King Tormax,<BR>Wuoshi, Velektor, you name it they resist it. This just reinforces to the players that the game is taking a definite turn towards warriors and clerics and everyone else can take a hike.<P>Shaman would appreciate being thought of and given a role when it comes to designing uber mob encounters.<P>10. Please stop giving away Shaman abilities.<P>Time and time again Verant keeps giving away Shaman abilities. It's no wonder Shaman all feel like cheap whores with their abilities being pimped away. We want this to stop. Give away some other classes abilities. We're already devalued enough.<P>Speed debuff spells - A level 60 Enchanter's maximum slow is 70%. Only 5% less then that of a Shaman. Yet their haste spells are MUCH better.<BR>Enchanters slow ability should be reduced so there is no doubt Shaman are the king of Slow. Slow is one of the 3 and ONLY 3 things I do on any raid. It is hogwash someone else comes so close.<P>Resist debuff spells - The Shaman Malosi line is pimped away to Magicians with little regard for Shaman. In the end, any Magician can replace a Shaman on a raid in this department because Mala comes so close to Malo.<P>SOW, Regen spells - Shaman abilities pimped away to Druids, who also receive highly efficient group versions of the spells.<P>Cobalt Bracer - Unique Shaman ability pimped away to Warriors. More careful design of this item would have made it self only.<P>11. Fix Alchemy!<P>See this URL the poster had most of the same ideas about Alchemy I did:<BR>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052724.html<P>Some Highlights:<BR>* Sellback prices need to be increased.<BR>* Negative effects of stat and resist potions need to be dropped.<BR>* Player made bag that combines 5 or 10 single use potions needs to also be usable as an alchemy bag to combine ingredients to make single versions.<BR>* Evil Shaman (Troll, Ogre) need both Alchemy vendors in their home towns like Barbarians. Yakatizma changed this a few months ago for Barbarians and overlooked us fatties. :/<P>Tugg<BR>L60 Ogre Shaman of Prexus<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I would like to see a new type of spell(s) for Shaman's.   This would be based on the spirit realm (Which is the natural area that Shaman's do and should excel).  The spell in mind would be some type of possession/take over action.   <P>Wait ... this is not charm or fear ... but possession.   The Shaman caster would have to leave their body exposed since their spirit would be leaving and taking over the targets body.   <P>Anything that can normally target/attack the Shaman could do so at any point during the cast.   It should also increase hate and Aggro effects for the caster ... so anything in area would come running for the caster.   Like Charm if the spell fails ... the MOB comes running at the Shaman ready to kick tail.   Also after it expires or breaks.<P>Since the aggro rate goes up (should be sky high) it would require at least couple of team mates to cover for Shaman during the cast.   Even make it short lived ... 18 - 30 sec's or so.   <P>What it would do (if it stuck) was allow a Shaman to take over a slightly lower level MOB for clearing or camp breaking.   The spirit realm is certainly within the norms for a Shaman.    Casting spirit type spells are in the spell book from the first levels.   <P>IMHO ... This would be a natural progression of the growth of a Shaman.   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Why give away such a unike spell as the malosi line of spells to the magician? Why is the malosi spells so easily resisted by mobs?<P>Why not give us some useful Group buffs. such as sow, chloro like the druid have, and better stat group buffs and preferably at lower level. Permit me to laugh : the master of buffs dont get stat-group buffs until long post 50 ?<P>Why are our melee skills so drastically cut down to almost nothing post lvl 20?<P>The master of buffs really need some better AC buffs. Compared to clerics we are nothing but dirt.<P>On big raids i wanna feels as if i really make a difference, not just stand there and shout Malosi resisted .... malosi resisted .... togors resisted ... need to med ...<BR>I dont mean to say that the spells are bad, but they are too easily resisted.<P>Well.. our buffs. The single target buffs are really great. I am a bit sad though that they are not so mana efficient as i would like. And that count for most of the shammy spells. Compared to other casters we have really low wisdom to start with (especially if ya play troll). I guess this is as intended because of our melee ability at low levels. The fact is though that when ya have gained a few levels the melee doesnt matter that much anymore. The mana however does! So a bit more mana to spelleffect ratio would help alot.<P>I ll just not mention the shammy pet =P .. I guess at lvl 50 i have summoned more pets than a lvl 30 nec/mage ... one after every fight.<P>It is true that the shaman is the most variable class in the game and that is the fun part of playing a shaman. WE CAN fill the role of many other classes, but not as well. However as you gain level too many classes can fill the shamans role.. it feels, well, kind of wrong.<P>Love my shammy and will keep playing him until i (if ever) quit everquest =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A few ideas.<P>1.  Fix stat buffs.<P>Make Str, dex, agi, sta, and cha buffs have greater impact.  Right now the benefit is marginal and they are primarily used to buffer the better buffs so that these get dispelled, not AC, HP, attack rating, defense rating, Mana Regeneration, Hit Point Regeneration, attack speed, and damage shields.  It should be just as noticeable when a str buff (or any attribute buff) is lost as when a attach speed buff is lost.  Its no where near that now.<P>My suggestion is to add a static effect to each buff.  I used the 40% benefit of a haste spell as a model for these suggestions<P>STR: have a fixed number that this spell increases a wielded weapons damage by.  This effect should be a percentage base of the damage rating of the weapon.  This way a STR buff is more desirable to people who use weapons with a very high damage score.  Say that strength (49th level str buff) gives a bonus of 40% to the damage rating of a weapon.  A person with a weapon that did 10 damage would now act as if it had a 14 damage rating.  A person with a damage rating of 40 would now be 56, gaining a larger benefit.  Note that this matches the attack speed increase of 40%.  It would be best if the str buff and attack speed buff could stack.<P>AGI: Agility should increase all defensive skills by a percentage.  Say the level 44 spell agility increased defensive skills by 40%.  This would increase your defense, dodge, parry... by 40%.  If a persons skill is 100, its now 140.  If its 150, well the agility buff will bump it up to 210.<BR> <BR>DEX:  Dex should increase the chance of a weapon procing.  Once again scaling up to 40%.  It should also decrease the chance of a caster fizzling by 40% and increase the channeling skill of casters by 40% for the 49th level dexterity buff.<P>STA:  Would increase a person Stamina regeneration by 40%, and/or increase total HP by 40%.<P>CHA:  Increase the rate at which mana is regained by 40%.<P>Keep in mind these changes are scaled up to 40% at the 50TH level spells.  Post 50 I think the approach should be different.<P>With changes like this these buffs become something that would make us worthy of the title "The King of Buffs"<P>To address buffs post 50 remove group buffs.  Buffs don’t make sense on everyone anyway.  What does a Necro want to hit harder with his weapon for?  The necros pet sure, but the necro?  We need some ability to control who gets what.  Rather than getting group buffs give combined buffs.  Buffs that go together though.  If the ideas above were used, a buff line that combined your STR, AGI, STA, and Dex buff for tank types, and another buff line that combined Dex and Cha for you to put on casters would be good.  It would make for fewer high level spells, but other ideas hear would help with that. <P>2.  Fix our pet.<P>Keep it in scale with our own level.  The level 34 pet averages 27th level with a possibility of 29th.  That’s an average of 7 levels below the level we get the spell back with a possibility of 5 levels below where we get the spell.<P>We get a new Pet every 5 levels from 34 to 50.  Keep that up.  Give us a 54 and a 59 pet.  Also make sure they follow #2 above.  This means our last pet would average 52 level and be possible to be 54th on that rare great cast.<P>4.  Alchemy is broken.  Below are a few ideas on how to fix it.<P>First off cut the price of the ingredients in half for lower difficulty potions and to 25% of the current cost for high difficult potions.  Secondly raise the prices to sell items to vendors to a minimum of 70% of what it costs to buy the items.  Third remove all negative effects of any potions that currently exist.  Fourth, add in some new potions of greater usefulness.  An idea in this area is:<P>Bind potions, and Gate potions:<P>Must be made in sets of 1 bind potion and 1, 5, or 10 gate potions.  The bind potion would be used to bind anyone in any location where a caster can bind and the gate potions would gate back to that specific location.  People could then have gate potions to go to multiple locations, but they would have to travel there once.  This keeps the world large, but removes much repetitive travel from the game.  The bind potion should cost around 70 plat to make, and the gates around 20 plat to make.  There would also have to be a two space travel bag that tailors could make.  This bag would be used to combine the gate potions and bind potions, once combined those gate potions would only gate to the specific location.  To make this easier you could have only 1 location in each bindable zone where these potions would take a player too.  This pricing and the fact that you must first go there to get there will leave druid and wizards as the mainstay for this service for porting from a place to some other place, but the bind potions would allow for less travel downtime, improved game enjoyment.  Make these vary in difficult.<P>Spells:<P>I would first like to say the Poison Direct damage spells are a nice addition.<P>I would like to see our disease dots made worth using in a group.  To do this simply half the duration and double the damage per tick.<P>I would like to see Scale of Wolf made in to something a little more useful, like work like SoW but only faster.<P>I would like to see something like a spell called "Legs of the Spider" that gives a slight movement speed increase in doors, and have it be shaman only.<P>I would like to see Bane lowered to level 52, and Pox lowered to level 54, with two new dots at level 56 and 58 that add another 30% damage to bane and Pox.  This just keeps our spells in scale with were they were at level 50.<P>I would like to see Swift like the wind at level 60.  It fits our pattern in the levels before this.<P>I would like to see the stacking problems fixed with the high level spells, these are covered well by other people.<P>Other than this the healing changes on the test server are probably about right.  If buffs are made to be good spells, rather than just something to be stripped away when caster mobs dispel you it will more than offset the additional healing druids receive.  This would be a great thing in my mind because I don't just become another healer.  I stay unique and pick up some group worthy abilities while not really adding to much to my solo abilities.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Hello all , i would appreciate some feedback on my ideas, both positive and negative. <BR>I havent been playing that long, but i am a hardcore player , and very strategy savvy. Started my shaman in august of 2000(messed with an enchanter to 16 before that). I have a pretty good idea of mechanics and am very open-minded, so i like to think i am a fair judge of things, and from what i have seen and heard so far my thoughts are these.<P>Stat buffs, if we are king of stat buffs, then we are kings of a not so usefull thing(in alot of ways). Its only easpecially(dont get me wrong stats help a fair bit)usefull attribute is making tanks feel tough.The effect the stats have at this time for the mana cost is piddly indeed, unless for powerlevveling purposes. I dont suggest that mana costs be lowered or that the effect be greater because our buffs already give alot of increase. In fact too much increase is the problem, what good is buffinf strength 69 points when the tank's by the time you have that spell will hit 250str with only 50 points or often less. heck at 39 i was putting an ogre and troll teammate at 250str (ok so they were well equipped, but by the time your buffs give a huge bonus the huge bonus isnt needed. I hope you can understand this, and no to the way to fix it. Simply enough, make the stat cap at 300 instead of 250, make the 200-250 soft cap marginally better, and the 250-300 as the 200-250 soft cap previously was. I feel that would both give all players a new goal to achieve and make shamans essentailly NEEDED to do it. hence giving us a more USEFULL application of buffs.<P>Negitive buff removal, I didnt think of this before but saw it on an earlier post. I had always just avoided using null magic if a party member was dot'd ,id just wait till it was over and heal up. Essentially these spells only saw daylight(or torch light)when i knew i was going against dam,age shield mobs. Maybe alittle one sided on my part, but thats the only practical reason i could find to take up one of my eight slots with the spell. A negative dispell would be IMMENSELY usefull, and i cant immagige too unbalancing if it is kept to a limited few casters(i.e. enchater(who i think already have it, shamans, and perhaps druids or clerics).very good idea and would save the pain of finding out what spells you just knocked off and then remmeming/casting. <P>Slow line spells, I love em always have always will, these in my opinion are our bread and butter and make up for our inherant lack of good heals. Maybe just a wishlish more than a NEED, but a lore slow spell sounds extremely usefull(although get the sprinkler ready on a raid because we would drop like a foraged dagger afterwards). other than buffing hasting, which in itself is probably enough on a raid, our raid life remains very limited. This type of spell would make like much easier, and well shorter for most shamans.<P>This last thought is probably onna the most important in my eyes, a MINI torpor(perhaos a battle usable one though)at say 44-49. I could do without a level 60 heal upgrade i mean if we are fighting mobs past level 55 i am not gonna wanna or be expected to be a viable healer. i think our lack of healing iss more evident in dungeouns like karnors or Charasis. a mildly effective overtime heal at these trouble areas 44-51 would be essential i think, something along the lines of 650 hp over a 30 second period with the root and slow effect tacked on i dont think thats to unreasonable. But by god, dont give it a 7 hour casting time and 3 day recast(sorry for exagguration). Reasoning cause i know you like explained, 2 secondary healers in these dungeoun settings CANNOT function as well as even one cleric. I have a monk also and have often done dungeoun raids with all tanks and one cleric, we could pull (ill use keosora as example all members around level 40)around 30 mobs before needing to let cleric med up,and that was only because hp buffs started going down. I also have organived raids with shaman and druids as healers and 4 tanks, since pulling multiple mobs slow wasnt an effective option for the shaman, but haste did let us kill quicker to save damage, and the druid put thorns up to save life through damage, we still could only pull roughly 22-24 mobs before a LONG rest was needed, and there were 5-6 more occurances where there were near deaths because heals couldnt keep up with the damage being dealt. As my shaman in karnors i and druid were once only healers in a 4 tank group, and we could only(pulling only single mobs)handle 6-7 mobs in a row from full mana to nill, while me and a cleric and 4 tanks had never really had to med up until we got a triple pull trained on us(which a shaman and druid CANNOT handle short of parking mobs and moving away),and in the area of karnors we were moving away to park somethign would not have been a viable option, as it would have left us in thew middle of the pulling area.<P>wow, that was far to long sorry for the huge post, i really feel that without alot of attention shamns will become not class balanced but class burried. For some reason i see a distinct indifference towards shamans by verent, i noticed this especially when talk threads started for balancing i read every class post and alan seemed very open minded , heck he jotted stuff down as things he would bring up that i thought were prepostrous, and when shaman post started i very distinctly noticed very valid points being dismissed left and right, Heck if you could look throught the first thread the entire first page i think were all , i think thats fine as is, or you dont need that, or that doesnt seem like somethign that needs changed. Maybe im wrong but i left the boards with a very sour taste in my mouth. I felt like a ignored child ina grocery store that just wanted a quarter for the candy machine and got slapped in the face for it. i hope that isnt the case.<P>Shrazkil 49 shaman,<BR>Piccoro 42 monk <BR>Bertoxx, Guides of norrath<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm not sure why this talk thread is still around. Absor is unwilling or unable to open a dialogue with Shaman. Without responding to ideas and giving feedback from Verant's viewpoint, all we can do is re-hash the same old talk. We have no way to tell if you feel requests are reasonable or if you think we are crazy.<P>OPEN A DIALOGUE.<P>PS: I would like to re-word my comments on the Malosi line concerning Magicians. It is true they also receive that entire spell line, but later then Shaman. However, in the last 10 levels Magicians eventually catch up to Shaman and obtain the end-game spell at the same time I do. Verant's solution to this was make their ultimate resist debuffer slightly less powerful then ours. Umm, except it still does a damn good job. Nobody is going to say "STOP THE RAID, WE NEED MALO".

Once upon a time, shamans used to have better DoTs, while druids used to have better nukes (slightly). After the expansion, druids suddenly have much better DoTs in practice (mainly due to the unavailability of the shaman spells), AND outnuke shamans with a wider margin than before. Any semblance of offensive balance between shamans and druids is completely destroyed, and these classes SHOULD be balanced if the situation between level 1-50 is anything to go by. Add the lack of useful pet upgrade to this picture and shaman, a former powerhouse class, starts to look somewhat pathetic.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Promise that this won't take up as much room as my last post.<P>From what i've read (and i've only read about half the posts in-depth due to time problems..) and from personal experience, there is only one real thing that needs to be changed about Shaman.<P>We need to be Distinguished. Most the of complaints from others and myself are that other classes have similar or better spells than we have - my question is if the shaman class is truely a unique class, why are any spells -shared- at all?<P>While it is understandable that druids get health buffs, str buffs, clerics get health buffs, enchanters get slow debuffs... shamans ONLY get buffs and debuffs for the most part. Grouping in Rathe the other day, my newest DOT, Venom of Snake, was rendered useless as there was a Necro in the group of lower level with the very same spell. Is this to imply that Shaman are Necro/Cleric/Druid hybrids or something? After all, we get dots, heals, and str buffs, health buffs, SoW....??<P>Please - I implore you VERRANT!!! Balance the classes!! Make it worth my time to group with other classes.<P>I'd suggest these changes to the class:<P>   #1   Add an additional ATK bonus to Str <BR>        buffs, AC bonus to AGI, HP to Stamina, <BR>        etc.; This way, the stat system does Not<BR>        have to be revamped for the buffs to be <BR>        more potent, and also increases their<BR>        usefulness.<P>   #2   Remove our Cold-based DD line, replace it<BR>        with a Cold-based dmg shield that is<BR>        equal in effectiveness to that of a<BR>        magician of two lower Spell Ranks, add in<BR>        a cold resist buff with it.<P>   #3   Point taken - Shaman's shouldn't have <BR>        pets nearly as powerful as any other<BR>        class. I understand this, and approve<BR>        of this. Perhaps add a new spell line<BR>        of pet summoning spells however? A series<BR>        that will summon the spirits of animals<BR>        and such for pets, each one possessing<BR>        different abilities? Not asking for a<BR>        Magi here, just asking that Shaman's put<BR>        a lil bit of that spirit-power to use.<BR>        Having the spirit of ox is nice and all,<BR>        but having one back you up in battle is<BR>        just plain cool :grins: even if it IS<BR>        weaker than our wolf pet..<P><BR>        On that same note, perhaps a spell that <BR>        summons a pet for the target? I could<BR>        see a lot of abuse stemming from this, <BR>        so I won't elaborate, but it would be<BR>        a fun idea.<P>   #4   A line of spells that transfers a portion <BR>        of dmg that the targetted character <BR>        recieves to the caster, thus reducing the<BR>        dmg the buffed one takes... very very<BR>        fun spell in my opinion.<P>   #5   The blind series is cool - why don't we<BR>        get other utility spells like this? Surely<BR>        shaman aren't just blaster healers with <BR>        SoW thrown in?<BR>               <BR>   #6   A word about our DoTing, DD's, AoE Rains;<BR>        why? It's not that I don't appreciate<BR>        them, don't get me wrong, but why give<BR>        a class that's ment to be the finishing <BR>        touch to an almost perfect group spells <BR>        that have been COMPLETELY overdone by all<BR>        other classes with the exception of the<BR>        non-casters?<BR>        <BR>   #7   Snare & Root: Why don't we get snare?<P>   #8   To put it bluntly, Shaman's aren't exactly<BR>        'civilized'. No, of course they don't live<BR>        in caves and eat uncooked meat (unless<BR>        they want to..) etc etc, but they are not <BR>        extremely advanced like elves, right?<BR>        Why don't they have forage? do ALL shaman<BR>        come from rich families that can afford<BR>        to pay for their alchemy education?<BR>        Give us FORAGE and let us find HERBS!<P>   #9   Alrite, I've pretty much pushed my point<BR>        to death, but here goes again.<BR> <BR>        We aren't original. Take away the buffs<BR>        that druids clerics and chanters can mimic<BR>        , take away the DD DoT's that mages and <BR>        necros put to shame, take away heals <BR>        druids have as well and sow, and we got <BR>        nothing that says "Hey, We're Shaman!"<BR>        ---- No wait, we have a wolf pet...<BR>        Alrite..? Verrant? Losing faith in you..<P>Anyhow, bottom line? If i'm mistaken in that the Shaman class was meant to be a buffing and mainly utility class, nothing more, just an all-round kewl Grouping class, than I'm truely sorry for wasting time and ranting, but if not, I'd really love to see these changes take place.<P>Trouvon Aracksus, 37 Season Shaman of the Tribune <BR>BrellSerilis<P><BR>PS - Sorry for breaking my promis  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well.since we have one last chance to post our concerns...<P>First question?   Who is more qualified to judge what the purpose/ primary function of a class is...The hundred (thousands?) of players who play the class day in and day out?  Or the design team, who may play one from time to time, but clearly (based on their biases) do _NOT_ play the same game as the rest of us.  The primary purpose of a shaman is DEBUFFING the opponent.  This is emphatically true at the higher levels, but is also true at the lower levels...Ask any experienced shaman what the one spell is that is going to be cast before entering melee with any challenging mob.  Answer? His slow spell. If he has to choose between skipping the slow or skipping ALL of his buffs, he would be better off to not buff and go with the slow, then to fully buff and not slow the mob.  Other spells which fall into this category are the malosi and incapacitate spells, although with more specialized application.<P>BTW...A comparison was made between giving a mage malo and giving a shaman better healing as being one and the same...NOT TRUE!  A shaman is by definition half healer, we spend a good part of our lives acting as backup healer.  Magicians are NOT debuffers, and no one ever tries to get a magician to join the group, just so he can debuff (or at least not till they get malo).  If you want to give magicians a debuff..Give them one that is specific to the spells they cast...Say a COLD and FIRE (maybe even ac) debuff.  That would be in keeping with a pet and nuke class.   Giving a mage a malo spell would be more like giving a shaman the ability to summon mod rods….Something I do not recommend and which I agree would be cutting into one of the mage’s primary functions.<P>More on Malo:  The resistance rate of the lower level versions is obscene.  If the spell sticks, it isn’t needed as any other spells I intend to cast would stick anyways.  And many times, after having it be resisted a few times, if I try DoTs or Nukes, they stick for full damage every time.  Seems like a spell designed to REDUCE resistance would be one of the least resisted spells (or else why have it) rather than one of the MOST resisted spells.<P>Alchemy:  I understand that the goal is to have the potions be sold to players rather then to vendors …But that is never gonna happen when most of the potions have NO market.  Not that I wanna see enchanters get nerfed (I also play on of them)…But why is it that when an enchanter/ jeweler  makes an item (A MUCH larger percentage of which are useful and saleable), if he wants, he can resell it for a reasonable percentage of what it cost him to make (90ish%), but when we try to resell a potion, we are lucky to get a few percentage points of our investment back.  Seems like the same approach should work for both.  Alternately….Remove the nerfs on the potions (make them add a single stat, instead of adding two and subtracting one, for example) or lower the costs (for example regen or damage shield) to where they might actually be affordable for the benefit.<P>Stat Buffs:  I realize that there is no way to make stats more significant, as that would create many more balance headaches than it would solve.  With that in mind, I do like the idea of secondary effects being tagged onto the stat buffs (as a previous poster suggested).  In an ideal world, these buffs would start with negligible effect (not unlike the buffs themselves), but might actually become significant post 50th.   The easiest way to add these effects (IMHO, as a player, not a coder) is as a proc..as we already  know the ability to add proc effects via a spell exists.  The effects I would suggest (and I am sure this list will differ from reader to reader) is:<BR>	Str:  A stun…Maybe 1 sec with the first str buff, increasing to around 6 secs with the highest level buff.<BR>	Agil:  If it can be done…a dodge  (don’t know if this can be given to a spell effect).  If this is not possible, then a very brief damage shield (lasts for 1 tick, absorbs an increasing amount of damage….say 10 pts at first buff, increasing to 100 at the highest level).  This may seem illogical, but it is really a way to kludge a damage avoidance proc due to increased agility.<BR>	Dex: A haste…Ranging from 5% to 25%..nothing incredible, but stacking with the spells we already have. <BR>	Stam:  Regeneration…Ranging from 1pt/tick to 6 pts/tick or so.<BR>	Char:   Not sure what would be useful here….maybe a faction benefit..but since charisma isn’t really a combat buff for most shaman, may not be relevant if it doesn’t have a proc.<BR>	Finally, one benefit of these is that you can make the high level group buffs useful by adding these effects, without having to also increase their stats (although why you chose to make them buff less than the single buffs I don’t know…For example..AE spells tend to do the same damage as the equivalents at the same level, and the AE is balanced by increased mana cost…Seems like the same logic should apply).<P>Syrtalis <BR>	<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, lots of stuff here is pretty straightforward.  I never had a character at post 50 or even lvl 50.  Hopefully by the time I get there (43 right now) that things like the stuff will be worked out. <P>I do have some issues.  First, I really think that shamans need a kickass final pet (maybe a polar bear or a kodiak), and 2nd, the bear form needs to be altered to something bigger (polar bear or kodiak) to make it really worth while, cause RPG wise, why turn into a small brown bear at lvl 55 when a real shaman could do something really kick arse.<P>Another point I would like to mention is about maybe adding like a group haste spell (odd, not sure if chanters have this since they get this earlier in lvls then us) that is original to us, maybe less effective, but longer.  This saves a lot of mana and time consumption.<P>Also group regen series and group sow, I still don't get why shamans never got this in the first place, especially since we get it before the druids.  Druids have other stuff that makes them stand out (wolf form, group wolf form) and especially teleportation.  Hell, just give us those, not asking for too much, or at least a lesser version of the group to make us still efficient.<P>I like that one concept on scale of the wolf (didn't know wolfs had scales in the first place, probably should rename it to like greater spirit of the wolf), but give us shamans like a group and single target version thats about the speed of a cheetah (more mana and longer casting time) mainly for traveling, and to have it where it will go off when you stop to fight or do any type of action to wear it off.  I mean that would really make traveling kick ass and something different to differintiate the teleport spell for druids.  I mean we do get SoC before the druids also.... anwyays just some thoughts...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR> I have played a shaman since beta 3.  I am currently nearly level 57.   Additionally I have a 53 cleric, 49 bard, 45 druid, 35 enchanter, etc..  So I have a pretty good feel for most the classes:<BR> On the Shaman:<BR>   (1) Post 50 stat buffs are a waste of mana with the exception of overburden.<BR>   (2) My primary role is HP buff (damn good thing a few of them stack) and mob slow.<BR>   (3) I am backup healer as long as I've gotten the mob slowed first or if another healer in group I am on JBB nukes (grouped only, root breaks).<BR>   (4) Alchemy (aka Alcsowme) is a waste of money due to the stat buff minimal effect.  However, I have made sow packs, invis-to-undead, invis, etc for my alts that lack the ability.  Only SOW and Gate sell.<BR>   (5) I suck at melee and I have dragon weapons.  Clerics in my guild have more AC than my fully rune-etched equiped shaman (plus he has Kunark AC stuff).  Post 50 Shaman do not MELEE except to land the epic DOT.<BR>   (6) Very few of the expansion spells are useful to me.  I think Verant should do some examination of the relatively frequency of Shaman castings of Spells (for the POST 50 shaman) and examine a months run of those casts.  I think you would find what shaman do use and don't.  I have some spells that I have cast once to see the effect and shelved at the back of the spellbook.<BR>   (7) My cleric would love to have a shaman able to fast heal in a group.  How many of us have seen another group member dying while we are in mid-heal of another?  (cleric or shaman).  Superior fizzle doesn't cut it.  I've had too many members die while I fizzled away trying a superior heal and the cleric was healing another....<BR>   (8) I have to disagree on the buffing description for post 50 shaman.   For knowledgeable tanks we buff my Talisman line and Stamina line (assuming we can get them to stack with the clerics, watch out for higher level ones), after that Im there to SLOW, JBB nuke or EPIC dot  thats it....  perhaps malosi if a mag isn't present.  Magicians take over the malosi role if they are there, to keep me free for SLOW.  Enchanter Tash's.  That's it.  No one will let a shaman have a pet in a dungeon post 50 (unless we're in a very very good spot for pets)<BR>  (9) It bears repeating what post 50 groups want.  Magician for malsoi, Shaman to slow, Enchanter to mez and tash, if enchanter in trouble shaman does root parking and slows the soon to be mez'd ones he's parked so they don't kill the enchanter when they free up.  Thats it...  I can't nuke since the cold based DD is resisted so high, the DOT's take too long (last night even the JUGGS went down before 48 second bane finished oh and the Protector resisted all the DOTs I have).<P>  Suggestions for shaman improvements:<BR>    (1) Winged courier (inter-group) spell from beta to return.  Item placed in our mostly useless spirit pouches could be sent to group-members via the spell.  To get items they have to have received a spirit-pouch from you and placed the item in it.  It would be awesome to be able to send a emerald to that necro whos about to summon your corpses.  I'm hard-pressed to see the exploitability of it, if anyone does please reply.<BR>    (2) Removing our stat spells would be a tacit admission of their max 5% (I'm being generous here) enhancement effect, so look into the other posting that mentioned proc effects or something similar.  I would love to see those buffs be of some use besides a overburdened bank run, and placebo.  Or hmmm how about those who have capped melee ability getting a boost?  Im talking your druid, shaman, cleric, enc, wiz, mag, etc....  for fun !<BR>    (3)  The shaman pet is a plaything for twinking post 50.   What about making him like the spirit wolves in East Karana semi-transparent.  That would differentiate our pet and indicate his relative power.... live long enough to taunt mob while I gate (assuming any group would let me create one).<BR>    (4)  Make the charisma buff useful by slighting increasing the rate at which a post 50 MOB slowing shaman drops down the hate list.<BR>    (5)  Slightly decrease the resist rate on SLOW to compensate for the enchanter being only 5% off our SLOW value.  Note that the slightly decreased effectiveness of Mag malsoi would then match the SLOW vs. enchanter SLOW  (note I have a 35 enchanter I'm not saying nerf them). I'm primarily talking post 50 btw.<BR>    (6)  The remedy clone for shaman should be an extension of the old INNER Fire line.  Be nice to see that line continue.<BR>    (7) Please reduce CANA 3 fizzle rate.. Im just shy of 57 now, when does it get better?  I counted 7 fizzled in a row last night.  I'm spec'd in ALT also.  The bad part is the 7 fizzles were followed by one good cast then 3 bad then 3 good... then bad again...<BR>    (8) Note that in Kunark beta I sent in a request to have %S or some such macro's.  They are awesome and thanks for listening (even though the S's changed to T's  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  What about a shift-right click on the spell icon bringing up a macro box that would allow you to tie some text in with that spell cast?  I know you can fudge it with macros but a property sheet could go a long ways.<BR>    (9) I don't mind so much the cross pollination of shaman spells to other classes (I play most of them also) but what happened to that unique quality that makes a shaman desirable? It has become SLOW post 50.  The mag has COH, Enc Mez, Wiz lure, etc..... I think you should always maintain a class differienation to those that you crossed.  Topors has it.....  the snare and slow effect.  We are such a generalized class (I remember the generalist description in beta) that we have nothing unique left but a level 60 malo and our SLOW (remember it frees the enchanter up).<P>---------<BR>  Getting late so I'll stop here.  I will get my shaman to 60 I enjoy him too much.  A lot of that enjoyment comes from hearing a group say: we need a shaman for his slow or wow great crowd control shaman (all the mobs root-parked and slowed).  I know I was a big contributor to the groups sucess even though most the time my group will never get the exp (too busy with crowd control and slow to have the mana to nuke).  I the shaman can survive long enough (in most cases) to do the crowd control or take the beating instead of the enchanter when the MOB breaks mez and comes after me instead (remember I slowed it after she mez'd it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Sharden 56 Shaman Karana<BR>Galeric 53 Cleric Karana<BR>Rannick 49 Bard   Karana<BR>etc....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One thing I failed to mention in my earlier post was an idea on Canabalizing.<P>Instead of having canabalize convert a set number of HP to a set number in mana.  have it converts a percentage of your Total remaining HP, to 50% that number in mana.<P>With this system:<P>Canab should convert 1/3 of a bubble of life to 50% mana.<P>CanabII should convert 2/3 of a bubble of life to 50% as much mana<P>CanabIII should convert 1 full bubble of life to 50% as much mana.<P>My objective is to take one bubble and turn it in to mana.  This change would make each spell closer to doing this in a single cast, with canabIII doing the job.<P>This change would make it so I wanted CanabII which is not worth getting right now.  CanabIII I can not have yet.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OH and one more thing,<P>BRING BACK THE INSANE REGEN TO OUR RAGE LINE.<P>It use to be awsome when you were low or nearly out of mana, you could cast it on yourself and do some melee.<P>You did not use it often, but when you needed to, it was great.<P>Now it just sucks.<P>If we cant get this make it a spell we can cast on others, with some changes to how stat buffs work, it could become useful again if I can cast on others.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think shamans need something to make them special again, since all our abilities have been handed out to other classes already, and since our "uber-buffs" are inferior to buffs . Two ideas:<P>A very low resistrate short duration/long recast modest effect (~35%) slow spell, i.e. a "slow-Lure"<P>A modest damage (~800) disease based DOT with some kind of "interesting" side effect, such as slowing/impeding spellcasting due to painful blistering of the skin, or causing a brief stun check every tick</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057511-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057511-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057511-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057511-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057511&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057511&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
