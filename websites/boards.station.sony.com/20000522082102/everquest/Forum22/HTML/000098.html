</FONT><HR>Just on the RP KS thing, you can't really RP KSing, because by killing something, you weuld be actually "helping" the person by helping them fight something.  So, in essense, what you would be doing is taking some money or "potential" loot from them, which would be like pickpocketing, which ya can't do to another character. So, I guess there is no real way to RP it without it becoming just harassment if done enough.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Just a quick note on Tansai's posting about a DE rogue KS'ing ( not intended as a flame BTW  8)  )  I saw  apoint brought up on another board...if you attack the same mob as say a High elf Pali with a DE rogue are you not in fact HELPING him  ( ie preventing his possible death by doubling or more the damage in half the time) so is this really a good excuse for KS'ing? Can you really consider this RP'ing?

</FONT><HR>I am sure this will open a can of worms , but when I saw a Harm person posting on a ksing thread I had to laugh. Also I read his same posting on the povar board on EQvault. Which he basically told everyone his side of a story and decided to trash the other guy in question. No I am not saying kornflunk (sp?) had done no wrong seems to me he was a real jerk as well. It just really bothers me that a guild such as HARM that had at one time a good reputation is now known as the Jerks of Povar. I have seen them train to get a camp, tell people to leave a zone because it was theres and theres alone, Seen them bash a persons name so badly GM's needed to be called in because they where even offending others in the zone with there harrasment. I have even seen them boast about haveing GM's as personal friends who will allways side with them so they don't care if they are /petitioned. Now I am pretty sure I will be trashed hard for not signing my name to this post call me a coward if you will , but frankly I don't want the 10,000 tells I will recive from them in game trashing me for MPO. Anyway my 2 copper on the topic.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Maybe u got harmonium confused with tor'drakon.  I remember at lvl 20(i'm 26pally now) i saw them train all of Blackburrow to the top.  I stopped most of the train.  but when they started shouting look at the newbies run... or wow, newbies die quick...doesnt leave a good impression.  This is one of the few things i've seen them do thats bad.  I ...unlike the guy above.. and am not afraid of posting my name.Maybe they have changed...but i see harmonium do so much good.

</FONT><HR>Good Point, Granted not everyone in Harm is a Kser , trainer ect and so forth. But since you seem to know who is why would you even want them in your guild? If you are going to support your mates when you know they are this way you are just as bad. Please don't give me the reason well it was hear say. Hmmmm X amount of number of people have had probelms with member X  and sure the guild says oh yeah that guy/girl is a jerk but yet Harm still backs them. And you wonder why people blame the guild as a whole. If you have members that walk all over people and no matter how many times it happens the guild just gives them a big fuzzy hug or what have you then yes I can see why people look at Harm ( or any guild for that matter) in the way they do. <BR>Now then yes I have meet a few people in Harm who I like and think are very nice people but they seem to be more of the exception then the Normal in that guild. No true I don't know every member on a personal basis.<BR>Well just wanted to give you something to think on. If a guildmember treats others like trash and the guild says good job then yeah people will blame the whole guild. <BR>Just another of my 2 cp </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Man reading this post i was super suprised. I thought T'or had a good reputation, well atleast the 5 months i have been involved in it. I don't doubt that we have had some jerks, in our past but they are very few and aren't in T'or anymore. I'd like to know WHO IT WAS in BB that trained you, and laughed. If you can remember that far back it is, I am astonished to find a T'or name in the list (almost as suprised as I am someone coming on here and saying Harm dosen't have the most Jerks on Povar). So I'd really appreciate it if you could put the name of the T'or Drakkon member who trained you and laughed. Cause I assure you I know almost every single member to date, and i don't know of one that would do this.<P>Overseer<BR>Lvl 48 mage-Povar (plane going lvl and still putting my name lol  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">)<BR>PROUD Soldier of T'or Drakkon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I do have to say that when the harmonium first started there were alot of people that were both socially annoying and always known to my groups as kills stealers back in my earlier leveled days. I remeber joking to one guy saying they arent keeping much harmony in this server stealing kills like that, but I do have to admit it did leave an impression on me especially when alot of these indiviaduals would come out frankly saying that they were going to steal and to stop whining you cry baby or something to that extent when members of my group would confront them. Now I dont remember the names of the indviduals but the guild name though was always poping up on these characters and it wasnt just a handful either. As to the Tor'drakkon the first few memmbers I met seem to be anti social never really responding to questions but I never saw them do anything malicious though in time the more I met the more I noticed they actually would help me in need getting sows from their shamans or heals before I nearly died. Though these just were the experiences I had with these guilds I am not trying to defend or put down any of these guilds just trying to point out that a "majority" of acts that are seen by individuals baring a guild name tend to leave an impression of fearing or likely the guild as a whole unit.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

He constantly jumped in a few fights my other character was in, and whined incessantly for free loot and help. I myself am tired of him. <BR>I've even been accused of KS'ing with my necro Croup. When I go to Orc2 in EC, and nobody is attacking the 4 orcs, I consider it fair game. I attacked, and got whined at and screamed at by a little gnomish prick whose name I, unfortunately, cannot remember.

</FONT><HR>About T'or Drakkon...<P>  We are here, on Povar, to have fun and be a family.  We do not KS, train, farm, etc.  We are OPPOSED to all those things, and fire people for violating the rules.  The rules are posted on our website, and this is the first 3:<P>#1 No Kill stealing<BR>#2 No training anyone EVER<BR>#3 No Vulgar language in OOC, shout or guildsay, NONE<P>  It is VERY hard, in a guild our size (easily 80+) to police everyone all the time.  I hope our memebers are doing their part to keep T'or Drakkon in good standing with all, but occasionally a bad apple joins our ranks and causes our name to be tarnished.<P><BR>  If you see this happening, please take a deep breath and relax for a sec, then think about the situation.  Is it possible that the T'or member didn't KS but that the mob aggroed onto them when your puller ran by?  Is it possible there were multiple targets in a FFA and someone mistakenly targeted a mob you were on?  Has this happened to YOU personally more than once? <BR>   If you think it was intentional or happens more than once, I would hope you would seek out a T'or officer and let them know of the incident.  Please use good judgement, don't get caught up in what other people say, go with your personal experience.  If person X killsteals from you several times, even after you talk to the person, let us know.  However, if person X has been rumored to be a KSer and you see person X get a kill from your group, don't jump to the conclusion that the rumors are true, use your own judgement.  <BR>    Again, we are a "proud" and "honest" guild.  We don't want to be the biggest, or the most powerful, we just want to be known as a great guild with great people in it.  <BR>    Also keep in mind that when we receive these reports, we will go to the person in question and get their side of the story, and we like to give people a second chance to redeem themselves if they deserve it.<BR>     It's pretty easy to have a really bad day, log onto EQ, have a small run-in with someone that is in ANY guild, and get mad at that person's guild.  We stress to ALL our members one simple thought that we value:<P>   If you do something nice, people will remember you - If you do something wrong, everyone will remember your guild.<P>  Unfortunately, due to human nature, anytime someone has a bad experience with one or two people in any guild, the image of the entire guild is tarnished.  Don't let one bad T'or, or one bad GC, Harm, NA, AF, Hawk, or another other guild, big or small, determine your view of that guild.<P><BR>  an Officer of T'or Drakkon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum22&number=22&thisthread=000098&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum22&number=22&thisthread=000098&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
