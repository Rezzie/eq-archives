</FONT><HR>BTW the situation as it is today is due to EverQuest's success. i.e. the players made it so.<P>Verant has grown and Brad has moved up the ladder. While this game would still be his sentimental favourite, he's now supervising a range of upcoming games rather than working solely on EverQuest.<P>In the past, these boards were a smaller number of people talking to a smaller number of staff. Today it's a vast player population talking to a really big company. Sony sat up and took notice of Verant, thanks to the players' recognition of a good game.<P>When these things happen, someone must be hired to step in and fill the communications gap. Communications between a larger player base and a growing company will become more corporatised, but the best hedge against this is to hire a popular person from the player base. That person will take player concerns to the company, and take company concerns to the players.<P>There is no better person for the job than Abashi.<P>Blaming Abashi for stuff you don't like about EQ is like blaming Guides for faults with the customer service program. Like I said, don't shoot the messenger.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well what it really comes down to is Abashi just really isn't that great at his job.  I'm sorry, I don't think he's a bad person, but seriously, his customer service skills are lacking.  Make a level one and ask some people about what they think about Abashi.  You'll get a 90% negative response.  And its not a matter of "bad press", many many EQ players read sites like eq.castersrealm.com or foh.noows.com and see Abashi's quoted responses in their full.<P>I don't know if Abashi would like to upgrade his CS skills, but here is some advice from a long-time CS person.<P>* Take a POSITIVE ATTITUDE into your dealings with your customers.  Log on the boards with a smile.<P>* When you decide to respond to a thread, respond to the most well-written, well-thoughtout post.  Respond to the post in its entirity, don't clip parts you don't like.  This is primarly my major complaint with Abashi's CS style, many times an interesting problem is posted on the board, and in the thread someone miss-states or redirects the thread, and Abashi chooses to respond to that question.<P>*  Your customers are your FRIENDS.  Be NICE to them.  If you have bad news or have to tell them "no" on something, clearly state your position and your reasoning behind it.  Your final response to the numerous lullaby threads was in a nutshell "Its not being changed, because we said so".  What you SHOULD have said is something like "We tested the spell, and after a discussion amoungst our team we decided that it is a spell meant to assist the lower-level bards, not as a high-level mass mesmerize with no casting time or mana cost.  We feel it would unbalance the high level game if such a powerful song was extremely effective in 50+ dungeons."<P>* Be FRIENDLY.  Joke with your customers.  Make a "taven" type board here, and visit it.  Pop in to tell a story in the "favorite deaths" thread.<P>* Never post off the cuff.  Always think through and re-read what you're going to say before you say it.  See if there's a better way to get accross your message.<P>If you choose to read this message or respond Abashi, answer one question for me.  Why is it that Calindryll from UO is respected and liked on the UO dev board, while you are not?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Saying that UO has no equivalent to EverQuest in terms of dissatisfaction and using current data is typical of Lum's Anti-Verant attitude.  Ultima Online has been on the decline for a long long time, and EverQuest is much much closer to the peak.  If you go back about 2 years Ultima Online newsgroups and message boards were chock full of people with complaints about the game.  I would dare Lum to do this using a news archive service, but even if he could(not sure archives go back far enough) he wouldn't because it would show that his point is a bunch of hooey.  He also threw Asheron's Call in there as not having this problem despite not using any factual data at all.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Lum:  I still believe the problem with your figures is the source.  Whineplay or Flameplay is the place where everyone comes to complain.  That is not the purpose of the UO board, either tacitly or implicitly.  Yes, you clearly claimed that these were your opinions, but then you threw in all those numbers which makes it look like facts.  Sure, you can go to a rant board and determine that most of the posts there are negative.  It's like going to the Republican Convention and polling peoples opinion about Clinton/Gore, then extrapolating that to the general public.  It doesn't work.<P>Lesifer:  I agree, it was well-written and made an argument.  I recognize Lum's ability to write and argue a proposition.  However, when you examine the "evidence" allegedly supporting the argument, the deficiencies become apparent.<P>Sophist:  I agree.  Lum's site and this board are the best Rant sites around.  The problem comes in using either as a representative sample of the EQ community.  And Lum did offer his "sample" as a snapshot of general satisfaction within the community.  Wanna know why the rants are more personal here?  Because Verant has a few people here responding to posts and actually making changes in game.  Origin doesn't.  Ranting here occasionally gets results.  Ranting there, doesn't.<P>Lashana:  Yeah, I've adopted the VAK appelation because it has mistakenly been applied to me so many times.  It's always been tongue in cheek.  I've also called myself an arrogant SOB on the boards, and that is clearly an exaggeration, too.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

You have lost any and all sense of perspective.  It was bad enough when you were locking threads because the topic being discussed was something you no longer wished to address; now, you are issuing WARNINGS to people for talking about those things, and having STILL not apologized for doing so, the only logical conclusion one can reach is that you honestly believe that it's okay to do this.  This is an extraordinarily toxic attitude for a person involved in customer relations to have.<P>The cold, hard truth is that you don't know how to properly communicate with us in the capacity of an employee of a company to the customers of that company.  Your "candor" is inapprorpiate, and your threats and bully tactics are completely beyond the pale.

Frequently, as this case exemplifies, he will toss numbers, posts, or anything else he can wrap his fat, greasy hands around out as "facts" supporting his "point."  It doesn't matter that often the posts are taken out of context (by him), deliberatly misread (by him), or completely irrelevent, I guess, as long as he can make it look supportive.  And his "numbers" are laughable in the extreme.<P>Hence, the significance of Lum's rants can be quantified in terms of the size of a gnat's ass.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
