</FONT><HR>Actually, ALL melee classes are in trouble when up against a caster.  My previous melee (a paladin) hated casters just as much as my monk.  I always thought it wierd that my wizard friend didn't mind them at all and liked to hunt them.  The only REAL way to handle a caster right now is to kill it fast.<P>My proposal (which would help ALL meleers and even casters to a lessor degree) is to make NPC spells interruptable just like PC spells.  I think they used to be but apparently not anymore.<P>Again, revisit damage.   As long as a monk looses a greater percentage of his hit points in a fight then a warrior of comparable level and equipment against the same mob then the monks need something to compensate which probably means greater damage output.  This should be checked at ALL levels.  Most likely things are fine at most levels but from what I'm hearing they are not at some levels.<P>Also, I don't think there is any need to increase the weight limit.  That limitation helps to define the monk.  However, keep that disadvantage in mind when doing balancing and when making monk equipment.  Remember that an untwinked monk will generally be poorer then an untinked anything else.  That is the main reason from a gameplay perspective why monks should be less dependent on equipment.  They should be balanced with warriors but they should not turn into warriors.  <P>Heavy monk armor which has the effect of actually REDUCING armor class (by pushing the monk over the 14 pound limit) is a sick joke and probably indicates that the person designing that armor didn't understand monks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First, I highly recommend that Absor or another Verant employee check out the discussions on the message board at www.monkly-business.com. Reading the posts there should make it immediately obvious what concerns many monk players have.<P>Second, these are the issues that I myself believe are definite issues with the monk class that degrade from the fun playing this class.<P>1-Feign Death not working correctly. As posted many times before in this thread, even after a successful feign death check, monsters continue to beat on us, especially when grouped and in Velious. Also, resisted spells should not break feign death.<BR>2-Monk quests tend towards hideously long camps. Perhaps the most well known problem camp is Raster of Guk in Gukbottom. Sitting in a room waiting for a spawn for 50+ hours, and in many cases over 100 hours, is not fun, and can lead to incredible stress if the super-rare spawn gets KSed when it finally spawns (as happened to a friend of mine, who was driven to quit EQ over it)<BR>3-Increased damage output, well argumented many times before in this thread.<BR>4-Celestial Fists quest could use a quest giver in Sky to stop low level monks from completing it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>* Offensive Power (Grouped)<P>One of the reasons why Rogues are balanced is that their significant damage potential is only realised while in a group: their target must be facing away from them to be able to use backstab. When balancing Monks, Verant will no doubt want to ensure that relatively more offensive power is given to grouped Monks than to solo Monks. Here is one such solution: add a new special attack at level 40, "Critical Strike".<P>The idea behind Critical Strike is that the Monk takes time to position herself in such a manner that they can strike at a sensitive area of their opponent, thus inflicting significant damage. However, this attack takes time to prepare - the Monk spends 7 seconds ducking and weaving to find just the right opening. If the enemy focuses their attention on the Monk during this time, inflicting even a single hit, the attack opportunity is lost. It is this interruptability that makes the skill useless for soloing.<P>Note that there is a precedent for a skill that takes time to "kick-in", namely Instill Doubt.<P>At level 50 it would be nice to see an upgrade to Flying Kick, as many have suggested. I would expect that an opportunistic attack such as Critical Strike would deal more damage under most grouping conditions though.<P>* Shedding of Aggression<P>Monks lack an effective means of "shedding aggro". Feign death does not often work as it should in doing this, and it makes *NO* roleplaying sense to use it in this manner (any reasonably intelligent opponent would see through FD if it was used more than once!)<P>Please, give us a skill that makes a little more sense!<P>* Hand-to-hand "Weapons"<P>More gloves, or even quests to raise our inate H2H ability would be very nice. This would enable those who *choose* to do so to be effective martial artists once more.<P>Isketh</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Something that works indoors allowing the monk to separate mobs that otherwise do not train.<P>I am not sure if this would best be tied into mana or a special skill at 50+ but no doubt this would alleviate our concerns with trying to be of use in groups post 50.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'd like to be able to quest for or even buy a shurikan that never depletes it's charges. Either lock it at 1 and have it refresh in my inventory after 3 seconds or so (time can be figured out later) or have it never deplete or show a use off a 20 stack if possible.  Call it a "boomerang of pulling" I don't care... I understand there are bracers in the game that finally come very close to granting this power to us so it wouldn't be a balance issue.  <P>I've already posted on where I feel we've been hurt by changes to damage produced by us in the game and our defensive skills as well.<P>Another thing that needs fixing in a major way is our shiverback armor. Or any armor designed for a Monk that is supposed to better than cured.  As it stands we are the only class I'm aware of that doesn't covet their Planes armor.  If it's a balance issue then you have design problems with your game.  Players are supposed to want to get planes armor or you wouldn't put it in the game to begin with.  As it is we walk around in armor that the farmers sell at the markets for 10's-100's of platinum instead of wearing our Shiverback we keep in the bank.  Don't nerf the stuff we do wear already that is not the problem the problem is the weakness of the planes armor.  Ask a Monk to stand up to a Blue MOB in his shiverback and fight it toe-to-toe, chances are pretty good he's going to have a tough go of it at approx. level 40 on up. Now imagine putting 50-75 more AC on his armor... He's still going to have a tough time of it. How much better would he fare?  An unbalancing amount? I doubt it.  As it is on several occasions I've died and been naked, as I wait for a res I'll go duke it out with a Blue and take a beating although often times I'll win.  What does this say for all that gear I wear presently?  Not a whole lot of it is taken into consideration while engaged in battle is what it tells me.  So let us wear our Shiver in pride, have it look different from cured. Give it some AC, at least enough to get it out of my bank please so I can sell back to the world my VOX bracer and my Bracer of Erolissi. Make me shed a Foremans Tunic and my Gatorscale leggings for what should be my coveted armor, the mighty Shiverback!<P>Again, reduce the weight on Monk only weapons. These were all created by the Monk Gods of Lore and the best you can come up with is 10lbs. or on some 2hb's 9lbs. or 7.3lbs.?  I'd like to be able to leave town with more than one weapon and my Tink bag plus my underwear.<P>You still have the best game out there. Without more changes to make your customers happy that will not always be the case.  How well you survive after that is dependant on how well you treat us all.  I have several issues outstanding with your customer service department as well as my server GM that have not even been addressed since they happened with the release of SOV back in Dec. That is unacceptable for any company.<P>Be safe,<BR>Ssyn and Sorolman<BR>Disciples on Tribunal and Bristlebane </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I still contend that the monk class is so broken with the requirement for uber weapons and the constantly failing FD... the lack of AC... the weight limit that prevents looting, yet the requirement for very expensive items to be successful... that Verant won't do much if anything about the class.  Face it.. with all the magic items so many classes have, the monk class was their one chance to create a pure melee class.  The problem is, they don't know HOW to.........<P>From Absor's response in the earlier parts of the thread you can see how out of touch with the class he is.. does it scare anyone else that he is the spokesperson for the class?  Not meaning any disrespect to Absor... but the person addressing class issues should be one intimately familiar with the class or too much can be taken out of context...<P>*laughs* the masters of throwing....

</FONT><HR>First off I'd like to say that I have both a monk (lvl 24) and a rogue (lvl 32). I've loved playing both but have noticed things that could be enhanced for both classes. I see alot of comparisons with Rogues in this thread though and thought I'd post a bit of info on that side of it.<P>First off Rogues are pretty much a group needy class. We do ok face to face damage but against a monk it would be no contest. We require a back to stab in order to show our class uniqueness.. otherwise just call us a Ranger without the spells. This can never happen if we are not grouped (unless the rare occasion ID goes off). Thus we need to be group AND have another tank in the group to be effective. At lvl 31 my Rogue has 761 HP and 610 AC with fairly great gear on. War's and Monks of my lvl have 40-50% and 20-30% more HP respectively and 15-20% AC and 10-15% AC respectively. Rangers can take alot more hits then us for wearing around the same type of armor.<P>I also see alot of people complaining about clearing aggro while in a group fighting. Rogues have evade yes, though evade will fail about 40% of the time (atleast at lvl 31 and I hear it gets no better) to evade I have to turn off auto attack then hit hide then turn on auto attack again. Something I dont have to do when I FD with my monk in a group. Monks are the pulling kings, with a bit of sneak and INvsUndead I've pulled the Ghost in unrest at lvl 24.<P>IMO Monks are very balanced compared to other classes in the game. It seems like alot of this thread is rants about Human monks vs Iksar. Though I agree with the fact that being KOS everywhere and having a slight exp penalty isn't an acceptable replacement to having regen, higher ac, better stats, and infravision. Factions can be fixed over time.. base stats and abilities can't.<P>                    My two cents,<BR>            Domingo Ashenfist, Skrumpy Knuckles</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
