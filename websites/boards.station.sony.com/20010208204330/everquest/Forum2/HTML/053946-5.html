</FONT><HR>JCDDreamer: whatever... Yes women are more emotional, but it IS just a game, and it IS just a chat line...  so you have to spend 10 minutes or so telling all your friends "sorry, my name was changed, please update your friends list!"  <P>Nothing worth crying over, really.  If my wife was crying over this, I wouldnt be a rude a$$hole, but I would politly explain its only a game, and you can notify all your friends your name changed...  my wife wouldnt cry over such things though, she has a firm grip on reality and that this is an easily resolveable issue.  <BR>------------------------------------<BR>About the 'more than two words'... Akeezi put it best  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Notice the examples given in the FAQ ?  Do those all look like more than two words?  Didnt think so... (read: Ontop)<BR>------------------------------------<BR>JCDDreamer: Your right, we all show emotion when playing the game... Ive died befor, while ALMOST to the zone line and shouted 'SH1T!' out loud... and that was the extent of it.  Befor I even respawned, I had gained my scenses.  The act of crying, takes alot of emotion... you dont just cry for a split second, it carries on for minutes to hours.  I cant think of anything in EQ that has aroused emotiones to that extent.... except maybe excitment, but thats the games intention, to be exciting, no?<P>Maybe she dont need a head shrinker, but I still think she needs to realize its just not worth crying over  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>PaganQWA,<P>    Many things can affect emotional state.  Shock being the worse... and this woman was shocked, cause she never saw it coming.<P>    It's just a game ?  Eh...  EQ is a game, but you can't compare that to any games you play alone on your system.  There are interaction.  You make friends, you make a reputation... People KNOW you by name.  You can tell your close friends that your name changed, but you can't change the Reputation to your new name.  And if you played 8-10 months with one name, this is pretty depressing.<P>   I have my good days, and I have my bad days.  Well... in the past few months, I didn't have enoug play time to be affected so much by EQ... hehe  My lvl 19 Cleric died 20+ time at it's lvl...  2/3 of those saving lives, 1/3 being stupid... (Well, it's going to work this time... NOT!).  Well, part of the 2/3rd... More than half of those could have been avoided... and I have to admit, at the end... I started to get fed up with some people...  And there were a bit more color in my discussions in groupes when I felt I was left to the Orcs as Dog meat and no one would take the Agroes off of me.  It affected me, and pissed me off... and I was in a Nasty mood... But it's just a game ?<P>   This person just lost her name which she was proud of for 8 months... this was her stress release, a moment of fun she was having from time to time... and she felt it was taken away...  I personally feel bad that someone that took the game as a social interaction got affected so badly... when you have Powerlvl'r, Ninja looters and Kill Stealers around getting away with Murder.  Compassion is not a bad thing, and understanding is golden.  It's sad that people put others down for weakness's...  It's why the world is turning mean... People used to care, now they just judge.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The naming policy is inherently subjective.  Verant wants players to choose nice fantasy names for their characters.  They don't want people to choose offensive names, names that evoke anything non-Norrathian, or names that don't look like names.  In principle, I love the naming policy and I think EverQuest benefits tremendously from it.  If you are not convinced, try playing a game with no naming policy and see what names people choose.<P>There are some names that are clearly bad.  Nobody would protest having a name changed that contained profanity, for example.  Other names are clearly beyond reproach, such as original names created from the player's imagination or the random name generator that don't contain words or phrases.<P>Then there is a huge gray area.  People choose names from other sources, sometimes mangling the spelling to try to make them acceptable or to avoid collisions with all the other people who want the same name.  People choose descriptive words and phrases, again often changing spelling.  If you are in that grey area, you should probably try to have a backup name ready in case a GM decides your name is unacceptable.<P>A name does not have to violate any specific point in the naming policy to be determined unacceptable.  Those are merely examples of types of names that will be changed.<P>However, in this case I would characterize a name like Managirl as containing a title in violation of rule 10.  X-girl, X-boy, X-man, X-woman all read like superhero names, not fantasy names.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Let's see... I have a few characters whose names are important to me.<P>Angelsyn Whitewings.  Cleric.  I've gotten plenty of compliments on this name... which, btw, is taken from a series of books written by my cousin and published in Japan.<P>Keyne Falconer.  Paladin.  Probably a better name for a Ranger, but I really wanted to play a Paladin...  Another name taken from said series of books.<P>Stumbles (Underfoot).  Dwarf Warrior.  I created the character with this particular surname in mind from day 1.  Then I discovered (to my surprise... I hadn't been playing very long after all) the Clerics of Underfoot.  Well, I'm still going to try and get the surname...  But if I don't, I probably won't ever pick one and just leave it blank.<P>Jenarra (Farseer).  Bard, follower of Veeshan.  Again, a name taken from the book series.  She's not high enough level yet to have that surname, but I don't forsee any problems.<P><BR>Now... if someone came along and said "Falconer" is a title, you have to change it... I'd call them a fruitcake with no understanding of historical naming conventions.  How on Earth do you think last names like "Smith" and "Hunter"?<P>If someone suddenly changed the name of my Cleric, Angelsyn... I would flip!  It's not a matter of needing to tell my close friends and guildmates... it's a matter of easily more than 100 people who know Angelsyn.  Who know that I like to sit around and help people.  Who know that I'll do whatever I can to get you an xp-res if I can't do it myself.  Who know that, unless I'm -dying-, I'm going to help every single person I can.  These people are my network of friends.  Ever since level 9, I've never needed to worry about getting a SoW.  I've always had people willing to help me with CR.  Heck, I've even had people offer to powerlevel me... all because I stopped when I was running past their low-level character and tossed a few buffs and a heal.<P>One's name -is- one's identity.  It's your reputation, and it's how you're recognized.<P>Whenever I go anywhere to hunt, I do a /who...  Because if there's someone in the zone that I know and get along with, I want to work with them.<BR>If I had been on the same server as Managirl and worked with her alot... I would look for Managirl when it came time to form a group.<P>There's a point where "naming conventions" are taken too far.  "Bluebuut" is silly, rude and just wrong.  "Managirl" is silly, but that's about it.<BR>Would I group with either of those people?  Sure.  For me, it's not about the name, it's about the quality of player.<P><BR>Oh, and it was mentioned in an earlier post, but here it is again.  Oceanus is a name from Greek Mythology.  But you're right... if you are a member of the FoH guild as your handle suggests, there is no conceivable situation where your name would be changed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There is nothing wrong with the name Oceanus, in my opinion.  The "anus" part of it is clearly just a substring and not intended to represent a part of anatomy.  Oceanus is the Latin word for ocean.<P>When you add the last name "Tranquility", it becomes less clear.  It sounds like you are trying to name yourself for a geographic feature of the moon: Mare Tranquillitatis, the sea of tranquility.  That makes Oceanus seem less like a real name.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have not taken the time to review the naming policy but it seems safe to assume that Managirl Beachbum is a violation because with all the messages post so far, no one is actual disputing that its a violation.  So the bottomline here is, regardless of any factors considerate to the player / person behind that name, the GM is within his rights to change it.  Once reported to or observed by the GM, he has no recourse but to act upon the responsibility conferred upon him or her.  The fact that others run around "unnoticed" does not mitigate the fact the GM must enforce the policy in this case.<P>On behalf of Managirl, I feel very compassionate toward your reaction.  After a year, a person playing EQ is identitifed by the name of their character.  When someone sees Managirl, they react to how they feel about her.  So having ones name changed strips alway all of that built-in affection that she has nutured over the past year.  So, in this regard, I offer Managirl my empathy and hope that she will continue to play because I am sure her friends do not want to miss her.  It should not take long for your friends to adapt to your new identity.  And just think, all your enemies now won't see you coming...an unintended benefit.<P>Toebuk, Troll Shadow Knight, Drinal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well this argument's gotten pretty ridiculous.<P>JCCDreamer - it's pretty obvious you're blowing smoke by claiming Oceanus could be changed on account of the word anus.  If you really like to stretch logic to that extent you could claim that all names are bannable by virtue of containing letters (all swearwords contain letters, swearwords are offensive).  In fact that would far more effectively attract flies to the horses so to speak.  I recommend doing that  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>And Oceanus... well your argument has deteriorated into a repetition of the same old points, but I guess there's not a whole lot else you can do.<P>I can see why managirl would be changed.  Basically VI prefer names to be in the vein of high fantasy or mythology.  Managirl sounds fairly cyberpunkesque.<P>Whether offensive, combined words, stupid, clever whatever.  It's not in line with the types of names they want in their world.  Incosistency is irrelevant in any individual application of these ideals - in short if you don't like the change don't try and plead ignorance to the reasoning behind it, attack the policy itself.<P>Anything else is an exercise in time wasting and inneffectual posturing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I didn't read all these posts, but here's my take on it...  and pretty much every thread like this.<P>Ignorance of the rules does not mean you can break them.  The naming policy has been there since day 1.  It seems like people commenting on the naming policy don't even know what it is.<P>Having an non-offensive name is simply a small part of the policy.  Running around with the name "Michael Jordan" isn't offensive, but is in clear violation of the policy.<P>Yes, it sucks to have your name changed after "getting away with it" for so long.  That is not an excuse, just like speeding for a year straight before getting caught isn't an excuse when you DO get caught.  Or, "but other people go faster than me!"  Bah, sorry for the analogies.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>There are some names that walk a fine line between violating the policy or not, and those debates I can understand.  Not this one.<P>Don't blame Verant for enforcing rules that they have set forth (which many of us agree with, and enjoy the results of).  You can attempt to attack the rule itself if you wish.<P>What exactly is this post supposed to accomplish?  Reversing the naming policy, or just this one name?  If the former, well it's not going to happen, and this was the WRONG way to do it.  If the later, then perhaps more players should read up on the rules.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

This is mental health, which we Americans could use a lot more of!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>randonloggin even if your interpretation is correct, which it wasn't, the player should have been given more time to choose. The GMs aren't so busy that they couldn't have sent the player a tell and said, "Your name is in violation of the naming policy. Please choose a new name. I will contact you again in 10 minutes. We apologize for any inconvienience."<P>But, for the sake of arguement, let's say the name was intentionally "Man A Girl Beach Bum", who cares? When I first started there was a Dwarf that I grouped with for a while named Captncrunch. I agree that that is in violation of trademark and could be seen as an infringement. I can see why the change was made. Did the name ruin my gaming experience? Of course not.<P>Anybody who is so "into the game" that somebody else's name "detracts" from the game needs to relax and get over it.<P>Go petition the name of the Dark Elf in Neriak named Litz B'Dolf....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I guess all of you, those that are saying this poor lady needs help because she had an emotional reaction (crying) to an event in the game that can and will cause many problems and complications, are emotionless, heartless, fatherless-sons that don't take any joy, any pride or happiness in leveling, killing a hard to kill MOB, or what not.<P>By your argument ANY emotion shown towards a games, means you need help.  <P>While I will never cry over losing a name, or dying in a hard to reach zone, etc... I do however get upset and angry when someone acts like an arse and I do feel happiness upon hearing that lovely DING! when I reach a new level.<P>Oceanus - I could make the argument to a GM that your name violates the naming policy by saying the Oceanus stands for 'Oh see anus'which could loosely be described as phrase.<P>Why do we have to stick with a 'given' name instead taking a nickname that we might have a background on?  With mana being a very real part of the world....  maybe the mother of managirl was an enchater herself and had some vials of Cloudy Mana lying around and had not yet chosen a name for her daughter... her daughter begisn drinking the stuff like water... and hence becomes known as Managirl.<P>I do agree however some names are completely ridiculous... especially when they delve into the realm of dood 5|033|&lt;.  Someone mentioned something about a troll named Ichhybumm... which I see nothing wrong with.. nor his surname... Skraachifast (spelling may be off I can't recall).  You do realize what trolls and ogres are doing when they just stand there....<P>Perhaps we should all start petitioning to have that little animation taken out... scratching one's arse in public is INDECENT and some might consider it VULGAR. Then we could expound upon that and say we must not kill the MOB's but be diplomatic and earn XP for making peace with them... as killing is well.... against the law as far as I know.<P>Yes... names need to be monitored... but names that are not VULGAR, OBSCENE, or plain outright not fantasy in any fashion... do need to be changed.  I saw some idiot running around with SuperSaiyjin as his name.  I check every now and then, after petitioning him... to see if it's been changed.. as of last night, it hadn't.... despite having a guide contact me.<P>Nym</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Lisset, I completely disagree.<BR> <BR>Managirl doesn't look at it as "just a game" in the sense of Gin Rummy or Parcheesi.  It's more like a private club in which games are one of the activites, but simple socializing is also a large part.<BR> <BR>In this case, her identity in her chosen group (her friends and acquaintances on her server) was removed from her.  She became upset no doubt at the many implications this had.  She was probably also not prepared for an assault like this upon her as a player.<BR> <BR>On a side note, I think people are far more lenient of anger than they are of sorrow.  A sorrowful person is self-indulgent and unstable.  An angry person is just considred angry unless they are nearly hysterical.<BR> <BR>Suppose you had been having a used car restored and detailed, and someone came along and scratched it with their keys.  Hey, it's just a paint job, why get emotional, the car still runs fine, right?  Wrong!  The car's owner gets very angry, and if they witness the vandalism they might even respond with physical violence.  Emotionally unstable?  No, just a human being who perceives themselves as having some property rights.<BR> <BR>In Managirl's case, she worked on her character for a long time, got to a fairly high level for such a casual player, got fairly friendly with a lot of folks in-game, and then someone who thought her name (which does NOT violate the naming policy, it specifially states that descriptive compound words like Treeclimber were okay, especially (but not exclusively) for surnames.<BR> <BR>Mana is not a word in common usage outside of fantasy literature.  It is definitely not anachronistic.  Girl is simply descriptive of the character's gender.  Managirl is a descriptive compund that describes her main in-game preoccupation.  <BR> <BR>Here is the line allowing her name from Verant's naming policy:<BR>"Descriptive compound words are allowed, especially in surnames (e.g. Treehugger, Giantslayer)"<P>Notice it does not say "only in surnames," it says "especially in surnames."  The main part of the sentence is "Descriptive compound words are allowed," which sounds to me like her name.<BR> <BR>Another thing:  Verant won't let us change our first names if we ask them to, they have repeatedly told us that the immutability of our names fosters a sense of server community and a personal reputation is important.  Why then was a name not in violation changed, simply because it offended the esthetics of what apparently was a Role Playing Dictator?<BR> <BR>Role Playing Dictators like to tell other people how to play the game.  I ported my Wizard to North Karana to meet a guild member friend who said he "had a present for me."  I arrived at the Spires to meet him, and he was wearing a new Shiny Metal Robe.  I complimented him on his appearance, and he handed me his old Oracle Robe.  Some Role Playing Dictator sent us an emote basically /rude-ing us because "my guild doesn't accept twinks."  Never mind the fact that a level 25 Wizard was wearing a Senior Apprentice Robe when she gated in, giving a valuable item to a friend instead of selling it is "twinking," and Role Playing Dictators don't like "twinks."<BR> <BR>It is this Role Playing Dictator attitude that prompts people to sic GM's on nice people like Managirl.  From some of the responses on this board saying "good, she deserved it," I feel that one Managirl is far more worthy to play alongside me than any dozen of the people who put her down.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
