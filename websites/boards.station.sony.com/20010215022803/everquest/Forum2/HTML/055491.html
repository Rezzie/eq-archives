</FONT><HR>We apologize for the previous Paladin thread going corrupt, Alan was still able to read a great deal of your input before it disappeared... so we will try to continue the discussion here, sorry for the inconvenience... ~Akriss <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cool.gif"><P><BR>By now you may already have seen some of the things that we plan to do with the paladin class in the hopes of adjusting their balance.  Those changes came about, mostly, from our folks reading the threads about the other hybrids and reading those about paladins that were started in preparation for this thread.  Feel free to discuss those changes as well, though I think they are all very much in line with what is needed for the paladin.<P>Here's a list that I stole from Everlore…  I was too lazy to actually look them up (but this list seems accurate):<P>a) Add Endure Magic spell at level 30<BR>b) Add Resist Magic at 55<BR>c) Move Guard spell from 49 to 39<BR>d) Move Armor of Faith from 53 to 49<BR>e) New level 53 paladin spell, Divine Glory, clone of divine strength but 100 hp instead of 200<BR>f) New level 59 spell, Celestial Cleansing 110 hp healdot per tick, for 4 ticks. 1.5 second casting time. Recast time 30 secs.<BR>g) Defense skill cap made exactly same as warriors<P>So let's start the discussion.  Please be detailed when explaining things.  But at the same time, please be precise.  I really don't need your background as a player, or detailed examples of gameplay (unless they are needed to explain a game mechanic).  These threads get long, and anything that you folks can do to cut down the amount of text or increase the readability of the posts is appreciated.<P>And remember, we're primarily discussing 'balance' here.  Bugs and such are fine to point out, but they are not the main reason we are here.<P>So let's hear what you have to say.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My idea for a New skill for paladins<P>DEFEND<P>1) 	This skill will allow the Paladin to target some one in his/her group <BR>	similar to hitting attack button.<P>2)	Paladin must be with in range of there target to defend them. THEY DO NOT <BR>	HAVE TO BE IN FRONT OF THEM. Monsters can walk/run though you. The targeted <BR>	PC will not be protected form magic spells of any kind only melle attacks<P>3)	When A Paladin is defending his target he can not attack back. He must have<BR>	a shield with him. The Paladin will take half the damage he would normally <BR>	take if attacked directly. ( YES, you can not use the FA weapon with this skill)<P>4)	This skill would become useful at level 45. This skill would be reflected by the <BR>	defense skill of the Paladin. At level 53 this skill will not miss, regardless <BR>	if defense skill is caped or not. This is due to the higher damage output of <BR>	monsters in the 50+ range. 	<P>5)	As one of the Paladins higher skills at level 57 a paladin would gain counter attack.<BR>	every time a monster tries to hit your target a you defend you will attack back. <BR>	the ability stays up till you stop defending your target.<P><BR>OK that pretty much raps my idea to make Paladins more useful in groups and raids.<P><BR>P.S. Abash , you didn't read my druid post did you ?<P>Sigh<P><BR>Regards <P>Delphie<P>level 60 druid</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Some suggestions to make Paladins worth while on epic encounters without unbalancing other encounters.<P>1st what makes and epic encounter different?  The ability to dish out damage in one form or another quickly.  Triple/Quad hitting for hunderds of points of damage comes to mind.<P>Mitigate: A discipline that when activated reduces a percentage of the damage done over a certain min damage.  So damage over the minimum hit would be reduced by a certain percentage for a short period of time.<P>Heroic Calling: A discipline that when activated buffs the Paladin if his/her god deams him worthy (e.g.  When hit by a mob who's epic flag is set the paladin receives a buff of some sort to make them more capable in these encounters)<P>Harry: A discipline that when activated reduces the damage done to 25% of normal and reduces the targets Attack and/or AC as the paladin is actively trying to annoy the mob to reduce its effectiveness. (This should not stack with other paladins forcing them to communicate and work together to keep at least one person "bugging" the mob at all times.)<P>Otherwise I really like Paladins.<P>ps. I can vouch for Arkand's comment on Naggy books not droping.  I've led 3 naggy raids on Karana and not a single book droped.<P>Perciful Pellinore<BR>Lightbringers<BR>Forged Alliance<BR>Karana Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, since all the other paladins are tossing in their 2 cents about how to "balance" paladins, I will as well.<P>1) Increase Bash skill<BR>Since we are one of two classes that bashes with a shield most of the time, it should be equal, if not better, to a DWing warrior<P>2) Increase our offensive ability, in other words, make us better at hitting the mob. Here is an excerpt from a discussion a 55th level paladin posted on our server:<P>"I think the main thing would be a slightly better taunt factor and better AC/HPs if you are going to go by the line that the Paladin is a defensive tank.<P>I would REALLY like a better hit ratio. I compared my wife's hit-ratio to mine (keep in mind I'm 3 levels higher) on the same mobs in the same fights:<P>Wife over 5 fights on same mob: 56% 67% 48% 72% 69%<P>Me over 5 fights on same mob: 42% 45% 39% 33% 33%<P>And this was when I had better STR (255) and ATK (1066). This is compared on total swings, hits to misses. So the ratio isn't affected by the number of swings or dual wielding.<P>The only difference I can think of, is that she has her Epics and I don't and somehow in Verant's funky math, this makes her hit more."<P>He uses a SotM. I believe he did 38 dragon slayings with no books.<P>3) This is purely a selfish request,if you are wondering why Soulfires rot in player's banks, give these quest weapons the same ability as their upgrades (Bash). If you cannot do this, extend the range of SK/PAL 1 handed weapons for the players in their mid 40s to 60. <P>I think you will have read post after post on this thread with paladins not having their FA/FD because of book drops, this means they are using 1 Handed and Shield, many of them have as their primary either a Holywater Sprinkler or Ghoulbane. Give them the ability to use their SF, just add bash.<P>4) I cannot comment on disciplines as I know too little about the high end game, I will leave that to those that are 50+.<P>Vaal Khon'Elvair</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Some very good issues / suggestions raised so I will not repeat them over and over again; however I would like to add this as my contribution:<P>Why is that Paladins are the only class whose epic quest becomes increasingly more difficult as you gain levels rather than the other way around (as it should logically be and is for the other classes)?<P>While the level cap on Nag/Vox solved the problem of a few high levels killing them for sport it seriously hindered the ability of a ceratin segment of the Paladin population to get access to the books, which anyways by no stretch of the imagination were droping on a regular basis. The solution that was offered was having the Kunark dragons drop the books thus creating a gap for the 53 to 57 level paladin during which it became almost impossible to attend ROK's dragon raids due to lack of contribution to the fight. Hell, even at 58 and with the current standing of the class on the Live Servers we dont have to much to offer during such an epic fight. The loot table on the ROK's dragons is so comparably large that even when they die they hardly drop the books, while it seems that everytime they go down they drop the scales needed by others. <P>In all honesty the current standing of the dragon situation regarding the drop of FA books is unsatisfactory. Keep the level cap for Nag/ Vox if you wish, keep the ROk's dragons encounters as difficult as you want, but address the drops of the books by other means such as:<P>1. Have the book drop everytime as an additional item and not to the detriment of the other drops. <BR>2. Fix Faydear's pathing / spawn time / whatever it takes to make him a dragon that you can actually have a shot at killing.<BR>3. Place alternate quests in game to be able to get to the Miragul Part. (See below)<BR>4. With the severe lack of Paladin weapons (vs a vs other classes) of any significance, other quested weapons would make sense. Why have you taken the Nature Defender out for the time being by perma killing the quest npc's ?<P>The Missing-Link Quest<P>It has been said in different occassions that the original quest for the FA is still in game and no one has solved it. So there is a quest that couldnt be found (this will point to same design or difficulty issue I would think) so instead of trying to find a way to make it more accessible you create a new one requiring dragon encounters. Sigh. Why not have an event or add a new Npc as a Herald that gives some veiled tips as to where to go. And BTW ".. he is passed by thousands of people every day.." which was offered as a clue is just not enought IMHO.<P>Consider the amount of time we have to spend getting the following items:<P>1. Ghoulbane<BR>2. Gather all the items to be able to obtain a Soulfire. Xicolti and Lucan are epic encounters at those levels.<BR>3. Doing the Soulfire quest, including the amount of time spent raising faction.<BR>4. Attending enough dragon raids to be able to have the books drop and win the rolls on them.<BR>5. Working on faction to obtain the FA.<BR>6. Killing Miragul and clearing to island 4th on Sky.<BR>7. Killing 3 epic mobs to obtain the components for the Mark of Attonement.<BR>8. Competing the FD quest.<P>Have one of your people figure out the best case scenario on the amount of hours and numbers of months you have to spend before you are able to go from start to end. What other epic weapon quest out there requires this amount of work? I am pretty sure the answer will be none, which makes the issue of the stats / procs combination on our epic weapon even more relevant as it applies to the concept of Risk vs. Reward.<P>Thanks for looking into improving the issues surrounding our class.<P>Tuuvian Caballero <BR>58th Paladin<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

We use to be at par with them but now we're under. I think it is fare since we have cleric in us. <P>I hear that LOH won't do complete heal on us at 60, if thats true that should be changed. <P>Some better disiplines that will help on raids will be good too. <P>Those would be all for now I guess thank you for listening. <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I think that Pallys and SK's are one of the only class's to use Bash. It definaly would be nice to see an increase in this skill.<BR>2. Disarm does not work allot. I have never played a pure tank so I dont know how well it works for them but I dont know why I bother to click the button..But I still do:P<BR>3. A higher Taunt skill would be nice. I tent to use stuns allot to acive this but some more points in Taunt would realy help.<BR>4. Specialization. I dont know if this is possible but it would be nice to specialize in a weapon like 1 hand slashing or somthing like that.<P>Just a few thoughts..

</FONT><HR>Alan,<BR>Thank you for doing a good job interacting with players on their concerns. I have seen a marked change in EQ since you took over this job. <BR>The following paladin ideas are ones that I have spoken with my guild who have all agreed they are great ideas, and I have played a paladin exclusivley since April 1st, 1999 so I hope you take time to read my post =)<P>1) LOH re-use time reduction post level 50, perhaps a 1 or 2 minute reduction in reuse time per level over 50.<BR>2) Critical hits vs undead. This should not be a discipline but the primary full time ability of a paladin, who is trained to combat undead and is guided by righteousness to battle them. If you make this change, you will see more role-playing in Everquest because you will encourage a paladin to be, well, a paladin. This would mean changing the holyforge discipline, too, perhaps to 10 or 15 seconds of automatic critical hits vs undead.<BR>3) Defining epic weapon. A offensive oriented 2hs (with bonuses to str, dex, other offensive stats) that can split like the warrior epic, into a 1hs and shield combo with defensive tanking in mind (with agility, stamina, resists and other defensive bonuses). <P>I want to keep this short so that you can get to reading other suggestions =) Thanks for your time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think SK's and Pallies should have a higher weapons skill cap, but not a higher offence.  Laldarie made a great post in this thread http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/054905.html I'll repeat it.<P>&lt;&lt;I for one believe bumping Pal/SK defense to 252 and Ranger offense to 252 is NOT the way to go. Making us one-sided is like making us half a warrior. Even less, really, for Paladins and SKs, because even with 252 defense, Warriors will be better tanks due to higher ac and hp. What good is a tank who can't hit the broad side of a barn? What good is a melee damage dealer who dies before a cleric can cast a heal?<P>Balance between the classes is important, but the hybrids also need balance within themselves. Rangers need enough defense to mitigate the attention they inevitably attract due to the damage they deal. Paladins and SKs need enough offense to hit the mobs often enough to keep their attention and do enough damage to make their melee time worthwhile. Currently, Paladins and SKs do fairly well, especially adding in their taunting ability through spells. But, overall, hybrids are WEAK. I'd like to see all hybrids receive increases to both offense and defense with none of the hybrids quite reaching the skill caps of warriors.<P>I'd like to see the hybrid offense/defense caps raised as follows:<P>Rangers - 245 offense (up 5 points) and 220 defense (up 20 points)<BR>Paladins - 235 offense (up 10 points) and 245 defense (up 15 points)<BR>Shadow Knights - 240 offense (up 15 points) and 240 defense (up 10 points)<BR>Bards - 225 offense (up 10 points) and 225 defense (up 10 points)<P>This gives each hybrid 25 skills points (except 20 for bards) with the points distributed differently for each class. This would make each hybrid overall stronger while maintaining a balance within each class. And by making Shadow Knights even at 240, it gives them a slightly different flavor as a middle ground, with Paladins remaining more defensive in nature and Rangers more offensive in nature. All hybrids would remain weaker than warriors in all areas but would become strong enough in tanking and melee to make us viable alternatives to a warrior in an experience group. I think these changes, along with the hybrid spell changes on Test, would make hybrids roughly equal in "Power" to warriors, monks and rogues.&lt;&lt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>There was plenty of good post on the thread, I hope you took notes reading them! And I urge paladins to repost here.<P>I had an idea (sparked by some comments in this thread): We need to be more desirable in groups. This is the main issue. This could be done with the following ability/spell (I'd rather see it being a spell than a disc):<BR>- "Shield other" or "Gift of Life" or "I-don't-have-a-clue": You cast it on a target (not you) and every time the target receive damage, half of it (or another fraction) is dealt to you instead. You have to be in the same zone as the target for the spell to work (obviously). It can taunt the mob somewhat (but not enough so that it jumps you instead, but leaves you second in his hate list). It should have a range (not working if the target is X foot away). Allow only one such spell effect to be on a target at a time, but left-clicking it should remove it. Or maybe not, making the life of the paladin utterly dependent on the behavior of the target (cast-it-only-on-a-friend kind of spell, not the suicidal-tendencies-warrior that jumps for 10k =).<P>This would allow us to add to the hp of the target for the duration of the fight. However, all the damage the mob does is still applied so it requires healing at some point. This would allow new strategies to be developped and probably would make the paladin a great addition to a group.<P>This would also greatly affect the effectiveness of the healing spells of druid/shaman/paladin. Their problem is not being able to cope with the amount of damage done per time unit to the tank. With this spell, it effectivly halve (of whatever other fraction) the damage applied to the tank, allowing the non-cleric healer to keep up with the healing even with their present spells.<P>Of course, this spell would need to be restricted on level45+ targets or in a range of 10 level around yours.<P>I think this is perfectly in line with the paladin 'mentality' of helping other and it keeps the main idea of 'healing' and 'protecting'.<P>If the idea is of some interest, then it could be converted into a line of its own:<BR>- level 15, transfer 10% damage to you.<BR>- level 30, transfer 20% damage to you.<P>If this seems too powerfull, it could also be made that the paladin is rooted while the spell is in effect, or have a mana-depleting side-effect. Or again, instead the paladin could receive some more damage that what is remove from the target's damage.<P>I'd like to note also, that this spell would not make the paladin too powerfull but instead make the group as a whole more powerfull.<P>Ideas for new disc: Sacrifice(?) You absor all the damage done to any member of your group and your based HP are double. You are rooted while doing this and it last for 15 sec. You cannot be healed for that period. After that, you die and every member is cure by 500 hp.

</FONT><HR>1) Holyforge is not working as intended imho. Paladin are supposed to be undead bane, which mean she should have no equal when fighting the undead. Replace holyforge which turn undead. Turn undead would be sort of like a HT that work only against undead and recycle about as fast as backstab but not affected by haste item or spell. Balanced the damage it will do so as not to be too overpowered but keep in mind that against undead a paladin should do at the very least as much damage as a warrior and imho be on par with a rogue. There isnt that many undead creature in the world that it would be too unbalancing.<P>2) Celestial healing type spell is not what we need. We do not want to replace the main healer in the group just support him when he is overworked. What we need is a fast casting mid heal with low fizzle rate.<P>3) Reiste magic line is not what we need. We need more of divine strenght type of buff. Meaning buff that are our own and stack with the cleric line of buff. My personnal suggestions are to make divine favor not self only. Make an ac buff that stack witht he aof line. Make a buff that lower chance to hot by artificially raising the level of the ppl only for hit-miss consideration.<P>4) We should be a viable altenative to a warrior when it come to tanking. Because of our much lower ac, hp and our lack of the disc disipline we are very far behind. What i suggest instead of having our ac upped is to acheive a parity of tanking ability via another mean. Specifically what i had in mind what to allow cleric to bind with a paladin of their choice. Then whenever the cleric heal his binded paladin he receive a bonus much like specialixation which reduce the cost of the heal. The idea is for the cleric to spend the same mana healing a warrior or a binded paladin even if the paladin will require more heals. Also a slew of other spells and disipline could be implemented in the future using this bind which would allow for example special buff or a disipline for the paladin which would allow him to take the place of a cleric in the agro list. This can also be implemeted wirth other hybyd/parent class like rangers and druid. The idea is to emphasised the special relationship between a parent class and its hybrid.<P>5) In the lvl 55+ game we are no longer the taunt master since most 55+ mob are immune to stun. This could be adress with a spell that is the reverse of jolt.<P>There you have it short and sweet like you asked  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ooryl, those other 2 disciplines are intented to have built in reasons to only use during an epic encounter.  I've helped with Ragefire and Ixblit several times.  I can't stun, only heal myself by steping back if i haven't agro'd and certain not going to agro the mob since as soon as i'm tanking i'm dead meat.  My biggest contribution is to drop LoH on a warrior so they can keep doing damage while I'm tickleing the mob with mid 60's damage.  Using Greater Heal is a joke against a mob that's quad hitting for 200+.  So in summary Paladin spells aren't really usefull for epics due the need for it to be short duration.<P>ps. I ment that Harry would reduce the paladin's damage output to 25% (not like they do much anyway) and reduce the mob's AC/Attack by some amount.<P>Perciful Pellinore<BR>49th Paladin of Tunare<BR>Lightbringers<BR>Forged Alliance<BR>Karana</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Which to me is fantastic. Thank you for that. But why can't we get Resusitate at 49? Instead of Revive. I know Revivescence should be Cleric only, and am not asking we should get that unless we start going to level 70 or something, but Revive is totally useless to us, and basically makes us only able to help out a level 10 or something. <P>It just seems to me, that since we get Resurrection at 59 why not give the previous spell in the line, that of Resusitate?   It seems it would just be logical. And it would be very helpful for getting the raid back going, people might not want to take the hit of losing 40% of the xp, but in some cases it's better then getting zero.  Just seems fair to me, and makes sense based on the line of resurection(sp) spells.  <P>I have about 20 other things I wanted to say..but all were covered in the previous thread which I pray you were able to read.

</FONT><HR>Low-level paladin offense<P>	Based on my experiences, a paladin, a warrior, and a monk, all of the same level (in the level range of 20-30) will hit a white-con mob a different percentage of the time.  Perhaps this is due to stats, although I doubt it.   More likely, each class has a separate "To Hit" table, or perhaps warriors and monks receive a bonus "To Hit."  Regardless, the end effect is the same.<BR>	Again, based on my experience, a warrior at 17th level, with good equipment (not necessarily twinked, traders usually have excellent equipment) can out-damage a 21st level paladin who has only slightly less good equipment.  A cleric healing both will have to watch the warrior’s hp more closely, but the warrior will do MORE damage, and hit MORE often, than the paladin.  Even with the skill number differences, this holds true.<BR>	Based on further experience, a monk of the same level as a paladin can out-damage said paladin.  The monk will hit MORE often, and do MORE damage than the paladin.  Again, a cleric healing both will have to watch the monk's hp more closely, but only a little more closely, due to the monk’s impressive damage avoidance skills.<BR>	In both cases, the amount of damage the warriors and monks do is not so much the issue as the fact that they seem to have a much higher chance to hit than a paladin does.  In the case of the warrior, this is true even with a lower offense skill, and a lower attack value.<BR>	In addition, paladins are disadvantaged in offense in several other ways.  In groups lower than 45th level, and even as low as 20th level, in order to do better damage a paladin uses a two handed weapon with a higher damage value.  This also makes it possible to cast between swings, a nice improvement over the old system.  However, doing this requires a paladin to give up his only alternate attack (Bash), while a warrior will still be able to use his alternate attack (Kick).  A paladin using a mithril two hander will attack four times (two swings with Double Attack going off) in the time that a warrior gets five attacks (two swings with DA, and Kick or slam).  Add to that the fact that the warrior innately hits more often, and you begin to see the problem.<BR>	A paladin might use 1h slash and a shield in order to get higher armor class, faster and more attacks, and to be able to stun/interrupt.  If a warrior used the same 1h slash weapon and a shield, then both would be nearly balanced.  Under these circumstances, the warrior and paladin would get the same number of attacks in the same time period, although the warrior would hit more often.<BR>	But why would a warrior do this, when he can dual wield and still get his extra attacks?  Dual wielding, a warrior would have the potential to make 9 attacks during the time the paladin  might make 5, if both were wielding 30 delay weapons.  And the warrior would still hit more often.<BR>	The biggest problem with the scenarios outlined here is NOT that the warrior makes more attacks and does more damage.  Rather, it is that the paladin is almost outright denied the opportunity to go the sword and shield route, due to the lack of really effective 1h slash weapons that are level-appropriate and designed for Paladins ONLY.  I would like to see there always be a 1h slash weapon available to a paladin that is level-appropriate in damage, delay, and difficulty to acquire, and that is slightly better than the best comparable 1h slash weapon a warrior can acquire.  <BR>	Crippling our offense doubly at lower levels, as is currently done, is in my opinion unbalanced.  And as the higher level paladins will tell you, it only gets worse with age.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Low-level Paladin Defense<P>	Based on what I have seen in-game, a paladin, a warrior, and a monk, all of the same level (in the level range of 20-30) will get hit by a white-con mob to a differing degree.  And well they should, after all, AC is important to the game, is it not?  However, even if the paladin and the warrior wear the SAME armor (Fine Steel Plate, perhaps), the warrior will get hit LESS often than the paladin.  If the monk could don a suit of armor that gave him the same base AC as the Fine Steel plate on the paladin, it would hold true for him, as well.<BR>	In fact (and I've seen it happen, over and over again), a warrior of 2 levels lower than a paladin, wearing somewhat better armor (crafted to Fine Steel), but with 10 points less defense, parry, and dodge skill, will get hit LESS often than the paladin, despite the lower skill caps the warrior suffers from.   When a monk and paladin of equal levels are compared this is even more evident, as the monk will have higher ac and his damage avoidance skills will work better.  The result is that, even at lower levels, monks and warriors can “tank” as well as paladins, while outputting FAR more damage.<BR>	In addition, and this is of serious consequence, the warrior class armor quest is VASTLY easier than that of paladins, and results in armor which has BETTER AC and arguably better stats.  The primary delimiter of a paladins ability to get his class armor (Sol Ro temple armor) is the NO DROP status of the Mistmoore Granite.  There are many other aspects of Armor of Ro that are frustrating, tedious, and difficult, but the NO DROP MM Granite causes paladins to frequently ignore the Armor of Ro quests altogether.<BR>	I hold the position that the Ro armor quest is unbalanced as regards risk and reward.  Were the armor increased in AC to parallel warriors crafted, it would be appropriate at its current level of difficulty.  Were Mistmoore Granite to have its NO DROP flag removed, Ro armor would be appropriate for paladins in the 25-40 level range.  As things stand now, Ro armor is only appropriate for paladins 35+, and crafted is easy to acquire for warriors in their mid-20’s. <BR>	The combination of increased hits taken, fewer hit points, and quest armor that cannot be acquired until later in a paladins career penalizes the paladin class seriously with regard to defense.  We have fewer hp than warriors, lower AC than warriors, get hit more often/more easily than warriors, and our quest armor is harder to acquire than a warrior’s and gives us less protection than a warrior’s.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

It should have its formula upgraded to the following:<BR>	Heal = ((level –20)+25) x level<BR>This will reduce the likelihood of LOH being abused, although it will make LOH considerably more powerful at higher levels, which will improve the lot of the post-50 paladin, balance-wise.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Okay, one thing that disappoints me is our healing ability.  I was hoping that we would be able to beat our druids and shamans with heals in the long run.  It was my impression that a paladin would be able to heal just as well as a druid or shaman (they both get regen btw, which should count for their healing ability, but they seemed to downplay that on their threads).  At level 15-19, I was the primary healer for my groups half of the time and I enjoyed that.  No, I was nowhere near as useful as a cleric, but I was healing better than a warrior with bandaids.  <P>As I level, I notice more and more that druids and shamans are wielding much better heals and regen spells as well as all of this dmg dealing power.  I would appreciate it if paladins were considered to be more healer than they are now.  Right now, my heals are pretty useless except in downtime.  Groups expect me to be able to provide backup heals when the cleric or druid is oom, but I simply cannot keep up with the mobs.  No, I am not asking for complete heal at 20 (although that'd be really nice to have hehe), but if we could have our heals moved down a circle (or something of that effect), that would help tremendously.  <P>Maybe it's the fact that I'm a high elf (little dmg output compared to others, but a ton of mana), but I really think we could be of more use with better heals.  The improvements on our spells recently made are very much appreciated btw.  Heals are more important to me than the buffs, mostly because I'm hardly ever grouped with somebody who doesn't have much better buffs anyhow.  Okay, thanks for listening.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Paladins pre 50 are rather balanced at this point. I have no issues there other than the lack of decent one handed slashers designed with paladins in mind ala Ghoulbane. Since Paladins cannot duel wield, a class specific 1HS weapon that would do about 75% of a Duel wielding class is not unreasonable.<BR>Paladins post 50 have been unbalanced since kunark due to 2-3 reasons: The spurious nature of the skill cap changes, the also spurious nature of post 50 weapon/armor design and availabilty and the lack of raid usable abilities similar to the warrior disciplines.<P>The skill caps pre 50 were balance as were the level advancement. Restore those ratios / relationships and you will see Paladins be very viable in their role post 50. Far more viable than now but still FAR less capable than Warriors in all rolls (Damage dealing, damage taking, damage avoidance and uber mob tanking), as it should be.<P>Keep in mind that spells given to paladins post 50, while needing to be obviously less powerful than equivalent level cleric spells and needing to give paladins less healing power than the other 'primary' healing classes (Shaman and Druid) should not be reduced in power and ability to the point where they are useless at the levels gained. Currently Divine Strenght is just too small a buff at the level gained, and the proposed heals on test are just too mana inefficient and too small a heal for the levels they are used at. Please examine these.<P>Finally Paladins desperately need to be able to make and IN COMBAT contribution to the high level raid. No raid anywhere ever happens without clerics. So buffing, unless the buffs are unique and stackable, is not the answer to be a contributer. While melee damage is never NOT wanted paladins are often ignored in favor of the FAR more eficient to heal and deadly Pure tanks. We are not asking to replace these pure melees, or to do what they do as well as they do, but we do need to be a VIABLE choice ALONG with them. Our current weapons and defense skills and spell selection does not make that possible. The Answer is most likely a /discipline as has been previously mentioned.<P>These 4 things are all I see wrong currently with the paladin class. <P>1) A certain minimum level of melee competance that was lost with Kunark needs to be restored.<BR>2) High level heal/buff spells need to be heavily scrutinized to keep them less powerfull than Shamans and Druids healing abilities but to still no make them usefull at th levesl these spells are received by the paladin. Currently a great majority are NOT.<BR>3) Class only one handed weapon selections for Paladins post 40 need a serious look at. None are readily available (as a matter of fact most all are down right unattainable for the average player) and there should be a viable 1 handed slashing upgrade weapon to the Ghoulbane for post 40 play.<BR>4) Raid ability. Give us some ability that allows us to help out on.seriouslty contribute against the super/boss mob.<P>These 4 areas are NEEDS to BALANCE.<P>The following would be usefull and can be considered 'wishlist' or ideas. NONE are necessary but all might increase the enjoyment of playing or playing with a Paladin:<P>Make the Paladin Hammer line worth ANYTHING at all to use, or just turn the graphic to a sword to differentiate naked dead Paladins from naked dead Clerics. :-)<P>Make the Paladin Lull line more reliable. As it is at level 52 Pacify is still so unreliable that I cannot pull singles with it (the intended purpose of the whole line of spells) and it is still resisted 6 out of 10 casts with a 93 Charisma and a 153 Wisdom. This is the 4th in the series and at earlier levels it was even MORE unreliable.<P>More background on the RELIGIONS. For gosh sake we should have some doctrince or belief system for Clerics / Shaman / Paladins / Shadowknights / Rangers / Druids so we know how to RP in the Milieu of Norrath as relates to our gods and religions.<P>Normal chance criticals versus all undead ala Ranger Bow Crits and Rogue Thrown Crits from level 50 up. (Same for Shadowknights IMO)<P>Thanks for listening to us. I am sure I am forgetting some stuff but these are the most imporant issues I feel need to be addressed.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I would like to suggest discipline GreatShield<P>At higher levels, mobs are unstunnable (I hear).  Giving paladins and shadowknights a discipline to change this would both change the entire high level game, and make Paladins and Shadowknights sought-after for raids.  Granted that Enchanters would be unhappy that they cannot MEZ high level mobs, but hear me out.<BR>	Greatshield would be a 28 second discipline.  It would not increase in duration.  It would require a shield be carried by the paladin or shadowknight using the discipline.  For the duration of the discipline, melee damage (only melee damage) would be reduced by 75%, and the paladin or shadowknight, on a successful bash hit, would stun ANY mob in the game (bash stuns last about 2 seconds at most).  HOWEVER, for the duration of the discipline, the shadowknight or paladin CANNOT MAKE ANY MELEE ATTACKS OR CAST SPELLS!<BR>This would provide paladins with something they have been crying for since October '00:  A big-raid discipline.  And the dramatic limitation on their damage output while the discipline is in effect (and the inability to save anyone by using LOH) should satisfy clerics, warriors, and enchanters who might criticize it as being "too powerful."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, since it did get deleted... I'll kind of recap some of the points that *I* thought were good, these are, by no means, the only suggestions that there are... I had just kept a list on my guild's message board last night of the suggestions I thought would be good..<BR>1) Give Paladins innate critical/cripplings against undead mobs at 50+. Really wouldn't be overpowering considering the noticable lack (not totally, but nowhere near what's in pre-expansions) of Undead mobs in Kunark and Velious.<P>2) This would take out our level 55 discipline (Holy Forge) opening us up to one (or more) of the following disciplines:<BR>a) A discipline that gives us a fairly high chance at interrupting high level (epic encounter) mob casting, and maybe stunning.<BR>(I myself don't really agree with this, I think we should have that in spell form)<BR>b) A defensive discipline... for example a parry disc, riposte disc, etc, sort of like most other melees have since, as basically every paladin has stated, we are the 'defensive hybrids'<BR>c) A Lay on Hands related discipline (sort of like Unholy Aura)... like a Group LoH.<P>3) Giving Paladins/SK (and warriors) the Block skill, but only making it usable when a shield is equipped.<P>4) Giving Paladins at/around the defensive type skills (Defense, Parry, Dodge, Riposte) of warriors because, currently, a well equipped Rogue/Monk/Ranger can out tank us not only because of the close AC gap, but because of their high skill in the aforementioned defensive skills they can just flat out not take as many hits as we can. Also giving Paladins better armor, not as good as warriors, but to widen the gap between the chain, leather and cloth classes. Afterall, we *are* a plate class.<P>5) Moving Superior Heal back a couple levels, as done with Shamans and Druids (They're getting it put at 51, we're hoping for 54 maybe?), and giving us the level 44 Cleric healing spell at 59 or 60.<P>6) Giving Paladins more Holy Swords (and giving SK's more Unholy Swords) instead of us having to wield weapons that were designed to prevent dual wielding classes from overbalancing with damage.<P>7) Giving Paladins (and SK's) more shields, especially ones intended for their classes only, since PAladins and SK's are typically the only (melee) classes that use a shield their entire careers, this would only make sense.<P>8) Giving the Paladin (Yeah and SK) Epic a 'Jagged Blade of War' type effect in which we could split it from a 2h weapon to a 1h weapon and a shield, the 2h weapon doing clearly more damage than the 1h, but, along with the shield, allowing us to tank more efficiently.<P>9) Upping Paladin taunt caps to at or above that of warriors. Currently the extra defensive abilities we have do no good against mobs that cannot be stunned or resist since we cannot taunt them.<P>10) Giving Paladins a high level, class unique stun, that has a fairly decent (40-50% chance) of interrupting casting on high level mobs. Giving Paladins usefullness on high level encounters, where most of us feel we are next to useless in. The price? Lots of mana, long recast time, high taunt factor.<P>11) Enhancing a few of our spells and giving us more spells along certain lines. Some examples given: Move Yaul III back a couple levels and give us Yaulp IV. Also giving us Resuscitate in the low/mid 50's (we get a spell worse than and a spell better than, but not it). Making the new hp buff spells (Divine Strength and it's less effective counterpart) more of a buff. Currently, divine strength, a level 60 spell does relatively nothing against a mob that it's worthwhile to use.<BR>Also giving Divine Might an atk type buff (not huge, as this is what we generally consider as the Paladin 'flaw') as it is a attack oriented spell.<BR>And last but not least, expanding on Spook the Dead (level 9 spell that we recieve no upgrades to), Flash of Light (level 15 spell that we recieve no upgrades to), and also giving us some unique Undead Only spells and possibly a low damage, self only fire based damage shield (I don't know about the damage shield)<P>12) Increase Paladin/SK bash caps as well, making them exceed warriors, who rarely use it once they get stun-kicks. Also, maybe a double-bash.<P>13) Give Paladins a 'let me take your damage for you' type spell/skill... mostly for the intent of high level raids... basically put it on someone, and all the damage they take is deferred to you, instead of them taking it. It kind of fits in with the 'sacrifice for the life of friends' roleplaying aspect of Paladins. I agree wit this one. <P>14) Make the Book of Frost drop more often or add it to more mobs (like the other two Kunark dragons, not just Gorenaire and Faydedar) <P><BR>Once again, I didn't come up with some of this, but this is a good list imo.<P>I definately don't want to see *all* of this implimented, but alot of it would be nice and help add more usefullness to our class...<P>Thanks,<BR>-Vikki T`Valorous<BR>52nd Half Elf Cavalier of Mithaniel Marr<BR>Officer of &lt;Hand of Faith&gt;, Xegony<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>i would say most of the balance in paladins, is and should be defense. the weapons (ah HEM flaming swords) are to make up some of the difference. but where we shine is in taking damage. not dealing it. at 55 i can take well over 10k hp damage, not including divine aura, or deepwater heals. that is fine as i can deal nowhere near that amount in the time i can take it. i outlast mobs when i solo, more than i kill them. <BR>that said, with any balance that needs made up, its that we are not efficient as we could be in sharing this defense, and thus it is rarely noticed, let alone appreciated in groups.  i noticed in the suggested patch info that the high level defense spells have not changed, and thus at 55 i receive no new AC buffs, nor would i later. that doesnt seem to fit with the rest of the changes, nor with the ideas those changes seem to be based on.<BR>the group heal spell is a wonderful addition BTW, i just wish i coud FIND it. hehe perhaps even a group AC would be nice.<BR>i also liked teh idea of AoE taunt i read bantered about somewhere. would fit nice as a discipline -shout or somesuch. all taunts in the next 2min are PB AoE. =) that would help add our defense to a group.<BR>as for nerfing, cant think of much, we already have really low 2hs, and as the class most USING 2hs that i have seen, thats a pretty big one. . <BR>disarm at what 60? with a 200 meaning you MAY occationally be able to disarm something weilding a dagger, like you meant to. .. <BR>some pretty insane quest for some rather average gear. . .

</FONT><HR>I am sorry for you Alan that the last paladin thread was corrupted - it contained alot of good ideas and you are going to see some reposts. Also unfortunately for you, I saved a backup copy of my post so you get to read it again.....<P>Given how long it is, feel free to agree to everything in the post and I will agree not post it a 3rd time if this thread becomes corrupted  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>PURPOSE<P>The purpose of this post is to address balancing the Paladin class. I propose that the Paladin class is significantly under-balanced as compared to other classes. I will state my argument for how they are under-balanced and propose solutions for fixing the Paladins so that they become balanced and a useful class in Everquest.<P>SCOPE OF DISCUSSION<P>I will limit my discussion to Paladin 50+. I believe that paladins are for the most part viable up to level 50. Greater healing at level 39 makes us useful in groups supplementing clerics, druids, and shamans. Our tanking abilities are balanced in relationship to other melee classes (less in every case) and Ghoulsbane provides us with a viable weapon for combating undead. Root allows us to root-park monsters and lay-on-hands can save a party if used appropriately. Our buffing spells are for the most part useless but are, on rare occasions, useful. I will leave it to other commentators to argue otherwise. <P>ROLE OF THE PALADIN<P>Within the EQ World, a paladin is a defensive tank. We are a melee class. We have significantly less offensive firepower than other melee classes but compensate for this lack of offense by spell-casting ability and flexibility. We are the masters of fighting undead. We are the best class for interrupting spell casters through our stuns. We can supplement the healing and buffing capability of clerics, druids, and shamans but are inferior to them in this capability. We can root park mobs as necessary to split pulls. We can emergency heal party members through LOH and other post 50 spells to save them. <P>Given this role, I will now discuss why Paladins 50+ are woefully unbalanced, compared to other classes, to fulfill this role. I suggest that offensively we are working as intended with a minor adjustment needed, defensively we need some adjustments to fulfill the role of defensive tank, and our spell-casting ability post 50 is totally, completely, utterly, unquestionably worthless.<P>PALADINS AS A DEFENSIVE TANK<P>Warriors, Rogues, Rangers, Shadow Knights and Monks will dramatically out-damage a paladin. Their offensive skills are higher or in the case of shadow knights, they have offensive skills so that they can out-damage us. Due to the cumulative effects of lower weapon skill, lower offensive skill, lower Double attack skill, lack of Dual Wield, no crippling or critical hits (even though they account for 1-3% additional damage, it adds up) and sub-par weapons, there is a very large difference in offensive output. Verrant needs to reevaluate if this monstrously huge gap in offensive output is working as intended. There is no debate at all that all other melee/hybrid classes should out-damage paladins and that they should significantly out-damage paladins. The focus of the discussion should be on what is a reasonable gap. I would suggest that the gap is currently too large - dual-wielding is the dominant factor in damage output and paladins do not and should not get it. To compensate for the large effect of dual-wielding, I would suggest that paladin weapon and offensive skills be reexamined and the gap closed between paladins and other classes. Raising paladin weapon and offensive skills by 10 would be a step in the right direction while maintaining the clear offensive dominance of every other melee class. Even with this change, our damage output will remain paltry, but the gap will be closer and we will at least be a tank. <P>Bash as a skill also requires reexamination. Bashes as a skill does minimal damage  - what it does do is interrupt spells. Paladins and shadow-knights are the only melee classes that habitually equip a shield. As such, I would suggest that paladins and shadow-knights, the only classes that use a shield, should have their bash skill raised to 252. It makes no sense at all that the classes that uses a shield in combat far more the other classes has a lower skill cap than say a warrior that never uses a shield after they can duel-wield. It makes no sense. This does not increase the offensive capability of paladins significantly (marginally if at all - bash does close to 0 damage post 50). What is does do is change a skill cap to reflect the game. Increase the paladin and shadow-knight bash skill to 252. <P> Our defensive skills, however, are woefully lacking. We are not a defensive tank because our defensive skills are somewhat low compared to the other melee classes. How in the wild world of gnome-juggling does a rogue (leather armor class) have a greater defense than a paladin (plate class)? I understand he can dodge better but defense? I understand he can parry better but defense? No way - it makes no sense. I would recommend that paladins are the ultimate defense class in the game and they should have the same defense as warriors if not higher given that most of the time they are carrying shields. Raise the defense of paladins to 252. In terms of parrying we are fine - we do not dual-wield and as such should have a lesser ability to parry with our weapon. In terms of dodge we are fine - we don't move so fast in plate armor but I would argue that the gap between warriors and paladins is too large - we should be slightly closer while warriors, the ultimate tanks, retain their superiority. Raise the paladin dodge ability by 10. Think of a human paladin and ogre warrior. Who do you think dodges better? Finally, I would suggest that Paladins should have their taunt ability raised to 200. If you really want to get someone mad, talk about religion or politics. Paladins represent their religion (you cannot be agnostic). To be a defensive tank, we have to have the ability to attract the attention of the monster. If we agree that every other melee class can out-damage paladins and should out-damage paladins, there must be some counter-balancing mechanism for paladins to be defensive tank and absorb some of the monster's fury. I would suggest that taunting, coupled with some timely stunning, rooting and healing, is that mechanism. Increase a paladin's ability to taunt to 200. Remember all those religious zealots in the airport trying to convert you and how mad you get? Imagine one with a big flaming sword in plate armor telling you that your god sucks and you are going to hades while spanking you. Paladins should be able to taunt - increase the skill. <P>PALADINS SHOULD BE THE MASTER TANKS OF FIGHTING UNDEAD<P>Paladins hate undead. Undead hate us. We like it that way. Prior to level 50, a paladin with a Ghoulsbane was good at fighting undead. Our undead damage spells did some damage but generally it was better to save the mana for greater heals and Ghoulsbane was an ok weapon prior to getting a Wurmslayer or better weapon. Our ability post 50 is severely lacking for a number of reasons. There are no weapons after Ghoulsbane designed for fighting undead. I would suggest that there should be a paladin only weapon, Lichbane for those paladins that specialize in fighting undead that is an upgrade from Ghoulsbane. Weapon stats would be 16/28 1-handed slash, paladin only, save versus disease +25, effect Expel Undead. This should be a quest no-drop weapon. Turn in your Ghoulsbane and Souldfire to your temple, have warmly faction with the temple, be level 49 or higher, and you receive a Lichbane. Each "good" temple other than your temple also has a related quest associated with fighting undead. These are hard 50+ quests that require saving the surrounding community from some undead threat. For each of these quests that are completed, the delay of the weapon reduces by two. If you complete all the sub-quests (four of them), the process on the weapon is upgraded to Banish Undead. This is an alternate "epic" weapon for paladins that focus on fighting undead. The lowest level Lichbane should be relatively easy to acquire. The highest level Lichbane should be as difficult as a class epic weapon to obtain with faction playing a large role in the quest. <P>Our Holyforge discipline is almost completely useless and is inappropriate. We should be the masters of fighting undead. After two revisions, Holyforge remains a useless discipline. While warriors get critical hits and crippling blows versus all monsters, we should have critical hits and crippling blows versus undead. Not as a discipline but all the time and at the same time that warriors receive critical hits. We should not be good at fighting undead some of the time - we should be good at fighting undead all of the time. This adds to the flavor of playing a paladin as any warrior will tell you, is not unbalancing at all. Critical hits and crippling blows are eye candy that contribute less than 1-3% to the actual damage output of the character. How can a 1% improvement to a subset of monsters to unbalancing? It is not. Give paladins critical and crippling blows versus undead.  <P>Finally, we should get Improved Invisibility to Undead and Sunskin (group invisibility) at the same time as clerics. As paladins, we live to kill those abominations known as the undead. We should have the ability to bypass the weaker undead and strike at the very heart of the undead strongholds. This is a utility spell. In terms of balance, this is not unbalancing. Any post 50 group will have cleric and especially groups that are focusing on fighting undead. What this does is add some flexibility and flavor to who is casting the spell and it is a role that paladins should be able to fulfill.  I am not suggesting that we replace clerics in this role but submit that they have more important things to do (buffing, healing, nuking) and that this is a role where the paladins can supplement clerics in their groups. This makes paladins more useful in groups fighting undead. <P>STUNNING<BR>Paladins excel at stunning mobs and we have three stuns at our disposal for interrupting casting monsters. From 39-55, this is often THE reason paladins are added to groups as there is no class as good as a paladin at interrupting casting and gating monsters as a paladin. This works quite well pre-55. The problem arises that all monsters post 55 are unstunnable, dragons are unstunnable, and giants are unstunnable. One of our defining characteristics and reasons for having a paladin in the group becomes useless. On the other hand, puny, little creatures like humans should not stun really big creatures like giants and dragons unless we start reciting poetry in the middle of battle.  <P>I propose that stunning should interrupt the spell casting of normal (not named or boss) monsters 55+, and 55- giants and dragons but not actually stun the mob. This retains the principal advantage of stunning (interrupting casters) while accepting the fact that ubber monsters are not going to be stunned or interrupted - they're ubber don't you know?  Bashing these mobs should work the same way - it will interrupt their spell casting but will not stun them if we successfully hit. It reinforces one of the principal advantages to having a paladin in the group - the defensive tank that is well suited to combating casting monsters by interrupting them. <P> HEALING, BUFFING, AND PALADIN ABILITIES<P>There is no other way to put this but to state the truth - paladin spells are for the most part completely useless. 98% of all groups post 50 have a cleric in the group. Cleric buffs are and should be superior to paladin buffs. Cleric, druid, and shaman healing should be superior to paladin healing. Paladins are a melee class with some spell casting ability. The problem is that our spell-casting ability is almost completely worthless. As it currently stands, a ranger is better at buffing a party than a paladin. This is so wrong and there is no way to fix this without some significant changes to paladin spell-casting. Given this premise, I will now discuss why and recommend solutions for fixing the problem. <P>HEALING<BR>It is important to define the role of the paladin in healing. Our role is not to be the principal healer in a group. Our role is to supplement the pre and post battle healing capability of the group so as to reduce downtime and enhance group efficiency. Paladins should be able to heal one bubble of health per spell cast on a fully buffed warrior after the battle so the cleric can continue to meditate and heal during battle. Paladin pre-50 are fine as we have greater healing at level 39 and can fulfill this role and from 24-39 we can use center as a heal. Paladins post 50 cannot. Greater heal (300 points of healing) heals about 1/10th of most warriors post 50 and we do not get superior healing until level 57. The problem is a multi-class problem as druids and shamans are equally as useless healing until they get superior heal at 53. This has been discussed in other class discussions and leads to the situation where every group post 50 MUST have a cleric in it to be successful except in the most marginal of cases. I would argue that this is wrong and is so wrong that is it intuitive to the casual observer.<P>I would propose the following solution. Give druids and shamans superior heal at level 51. This allows them to fulfill the role as healer in a low level 50s group. Give them celestial healing or similar spell at level 55 so that they remain viable in high-level groups while not replacing the role of clerics. Give paladins superior heal at level 54. This allows paladins the capability to supplement the healing power of the group without becoming the principal healer in the group. Give paladins celestial healing at level 59. The currently proposed Celestial cleansing is a terrible spell and just worthless at level 59. It would be useful if we were fighting sand giants or monsters that hit like sand giants at level 59 but then again we are not. Give paladins celestial healing at level 59. Greater heal is simply useless in the post 50 game as it heals 1/10th of fully buffed warrior. Superior healing becomes equally useless as characters approach level 60. Clerics retain their ability as the principal healers in the game with complete heal - the most common type of a heal post 50 and the most efficient heal. They also have a wider range of healing spells so that they can tailor the healing solution to the group and the situation. Druids and shamans become better healers (although not as good as a cleric) and paladins return to being able to heal 1-2 bubbles of health before and after a battle. Groups without a cleric but with a druid and shaman become viable again. Paladins become viable as a supplemental healer. To retain the current situation, you are saying to paladins forget all the lessons you have learned about your role for the last 50 levels - from 50-60 you will be useless as a supplemental healer in your group. We will give you superior healing at level 57 because that is about when we think it will be useless to you as a class. I guess it comes down to this - I don’t understand my role as a defensive tank, given all of the tanking ability that I must sacrifice to cast spells, if I can't heal even 1 bubble of health on a fully buffed warrior with one spell. <P>BUFFING<BR>It is important to define the role of the paladin in buffing. Our role is not to be the principal buffer in a group. Our role is to supplement the buffs of group. The problem is that all of our buffs are vastly inferior subsets of cleric buffs that are completely useless when there is a cleric in the group and there is ALWAYS a cleric in the group post 50. In fact, our brethren the rangers are better than paladins currently at buffing a group because they have strength of nature and call of earth which stack with everything and have great effects. We have NOTHING that contributes to the buffing of a group. I submit that even to the casual observer this is wrong - rangers, the offensive hybrids, should not be able to outbuff the paladins, the defensive hybrids but in every viable group (read a group with a cleric) they can. This is completely unbalancing. <P>This problem requires multiple solutions. First, make groups without clerics viable by enhancing the healing power of druids and shamans. Then those useless buffs that a paladin gets are not as useless - only mostly useless. Second, give paladins, like rangers, two buffs at level 50 (not level 60 where it is obsolete) that will stack with every other buff. I don't play a paladin to be a watered-down warrior and cleric. Paladins, rangers, and shadow knights are a distinct class and we should have our distinct abilities that contribute to the group. Stop treating me as a watered-down cleric. I am a paladin. Stop treating shadow knights as a watered down necromancer. They are shadow knights. I applaud Verrant for fixing rangers - they should have call of nature and strength of earth - it is a class defining buff that is appropriate and makes rangers more group friendly. Paladins should have a similar capability - one or two buffs that stack with everything and reflect the unique contribution of a paladin to the group. One or two buffs that make us useful in a group even if there is a cleric in the group. Give us these buffs at the same time as rangers so that they are useful. One way to do this is to move divine strength to level 51. Paladins are not the principal buffers in a group - they are supplemental - they should have one or two buffs that reflect their role as defensive tank in the group. Of all the hybrids, paladins should be able to buff the best. Did I mention I am not a watered down cleric and stop treating me as such? Paladins, like rangers and shadow knights, are a distinct class - please start treating me as such and give me distinct buffs (just 1-2) that make paladins wanted in a group.<P>Finally, you need to relook the stacking conflict between Call of Earth and Divine Strength. Rangers get Call of Earth at level 50, a store bought buff that OVERRIDES the level 60 paladin buff, Divine Strength - a spell that is only droppable through monsters. Call of Earth is arguably a better buff. I am not going to beat this dead horse - fix it. If you are going to move divine strength to 51 as I suggest above, then make it store bought. If you are going to leave it as a level 60 buff, make it stack with the ranger buff and significantly increase its power so that it is a better buff than a store-bought spell ten levels its junior. Even an ogre drunk on Kalash can figure this is just wrong.<P>MISCELLANIOUS SPELL NOTES<BR>Besides healing and buffing, paladins have a limited number of utility spells. The first one that I would like to discuss is Yaulp. Ask any cleric what their most useless spell line is and it will be a toss-up between the Yaulp line and Pacify line (paladins get both of these spell lines). Clerics don't melee. Yaulp is a very short duration melee spell that increases your AC and strength. It is worthless to a cleric. It is valuable to a paladin. In fact, I would contend that it is the perfect addition to the paladin. The problem is that clerics get Yaulp I to Yaulp IV which they never, ever, ever use while paladins only get Yaulp I to III and we get it much later than clerics. Hello, Hello, McFly are are you there? Paladins are the melee class. Clerics are the non-melee class. We should get Yaulp before clerics do and not after they do and we should be better at it. Paladins yaulp all the time. Clerics heal, buff, and nuke occasionally. They don't melee. They don't yaulp any more than dark elves sell girl scout cookies. Move yaulp II to 15th level for paladins. Move yualp III to 39th level. Add yualp IV to the paladin spell list and place it at 51st level. Create a new spell Group Yualp IV and add it to 57th level. Let the paladins yualp like the crazy fools they are. It will have a minor effect on their effectiveness but will add tons to the flavor of being a paladin. <P>Paladins receive Halo of Light and a small collection of generally worthless hammer summoning spells. These items are not powerful but are occasionally useful after you have been killed on a fear raid and are running back to the portal. Change the tag on these items so that they are not no drop. It is not like we are going to become master summoners with these three spells but it sure would be useful to give that blind barbarian warrior standing next to you a halo of light so that he can see well enough to run back to the portal from Ogguk. It is not like we are going to become hammer dispensing machines given the horrible stats on the summoned weapons but it sure would be nice to hand the warrior a hammer for the run back instead of equipping one yourself and saying I am sorry but this worthless hammer is no drop so I can't help you. Let me help the recently deceased please. The recently living would not take these items if I were giving them away. <P>Paladins can root and enstill. These spells really represent two separate parking spell lines. Root and immobilize are short term parking solutions while enstill and paralyzing earth are long term parking solutions. Root is fine at level 22. Enstill is not at level 54. I would suggest that paladins are short-term combat parkers and not long-term parkers. We really should get immobilize before we get enstill if we get enstill at all. Add immobilize as a 51st level spell and reconsider whether we get enstill at all.  <P>LAY ON HANDS<BR>Lay on hands is for all effective purposes a paladin only discipline. It is also the only paladin discipline worth anything. After two recent revisions, lay on hands is viable in terms of the number of hitpoints healed. While I would like to see LOH be a complete heal, it is working acceptably now as a partial heal. The problem with LOH is the cycle time on it. Before we dig into this, let’s examine the role of LOH. LOH is not a routine heal - it is an emergency heal with an almost instant cast time - it is for saving lives. The recycle time on LOH should reflect this - an emergency heal that is never factored into a healing plan and only used in extremis. The problem is that the cycle time on LOH is currently 72 minutes and this does not change despite your level. I am not certain how you play Everquest but extremis generally occurs far more frequently than every 72 minutes and normally it affects the entire party instead of just one member. While LOH should never be part of the group healing plan, it should be a more useful discipline/ability. I would suggest that paladins should have the cycle time reduced as they gain levels using the following formula: the maximum of (72 - level of paladin) or 30. This provides a very gradual scaling in terms of the effectiveness of LOH so that LOH becomes a more powerful as the paladin gains levels with a cap of 30 minutes on the use of LOH. A paladin, except in the most unique of situations, would not be able to use LOH in the same encounter but his or her ability to save folks should increase as he gains levels. 72 minutes is too long of a period currently. Reduce the recycle time for LOH to be the maximum of (72 - level of paladin) or 30.<P>OTHER DISCIPLINES<BR>Paladin disciplines are about as useful as ogre in a tutu dancing. It is painful to contemplate and even worst to see in action. Paladin disciplines are worthless. I will not bore you with the details because it is not worth the time to type it. What paladins need is one, just one, useful discipline for ubber mob raids during the levels 55-60. This is the number one complaint from the paladin community - we cannot get invited on an ubber mob raid because we have nothing to offer - our only contribution to the raid is to generate lag and act as a one second speed bump. We die so fast that we do not even have time to LOH. We need a discipline that makes paladins attractive for a raid. This discipline should reconfirm our role as defensive tank. I would suggest the following discipline:<P>Holy Shield<P>Level Obtained: 55<BR>Duration: 3 minutes<BR>Re-use delay: 15 minutes<BR>Re-use delay at level 60: 10 minutes<P>Effect: The paladin takes 50% less damage while the holy shield is in effect. This will not reduce damage taken by the paladin from any form of damage shield or weapon process. This discipline lasts for 3 minutes and has a base reuse time of 15 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the paladin gains additional levels. <P>Discussion: This is a powerful discipline. It will allow us to survive much longer and require less healing. Our paltry damage output remains the same - but we can last longer and do at least some damage to the monster. We will not supplant warriors as the mainstay on any raid but instead we become, in limited number, a viable addition to a raid party. I realize that what I am proposing is a significant change. The problem is that anything less is just not going to work - we will be shunned from raids as we have nothing to offer. We cannot heal. We cannot buff. Every other melee can generate significantly more offensive output. Warriors have more ac, more hitpoints, higher skill caps, and a defensive discipline that reduces damage by 40%. While it is active, they can still deal more damage then we can. Paladins are defensive tanks. We need a powerful discipline (read more powerful than defensive) that makes us more attractive to a raid. Anything less simply will not work and it is time to move the paladin armor/weapons to a mob that is less than ubber that we can contribute to the destruction of. I suggest that holy shield is the right discipline. <P>CONCLUSION<P>This brings me to the end of my discussion of the Paladin class. I would like to apologize to Akriss_Flamewalker (alla Alan) as you asked for some short ideas on balancing the paladin class. The problems is there are no easy solutions. Paladins today are the rogues of a year ago and the warriors of 1 1/2 years ago. We are significantly underpowered compared to other classes. Some guilds will not invite paladins because of these problems. Some groups will not accept a paladin but instead will continue to hold an opening waiting for a "real" tank. It will require some significant changes to fix paladins. I have included a summary of the recommended changes as Appendix 1 to this document. <P>I would humbly suggest that you should not lie awake at night worry at night about nerfing Donal's Chestplate of Mourning or manastones. They are items. You should worry about disenfranchising segments of your player base because they are unbalanced.  They are people and many are very good, decent people. While I appreciate your attempt to connect with the player base, it does not take an erudite wizard to figure out class unbalances. Paladins, and Shadow Knights have some serious problems that need to be addressed. Wizards need their mana regeneration increased (a harvest 2 spell and enhance manaskin). Druids and Shamans, and to a lesser extent paladins, need to heal better. This is where you spend your time balancing. If you come out with large numbers of enhancements for warriors, rogues, enchanters, and clerics, your integrity will be compromised and your intellect questioned. I have included my opinion on the strength of classes in Appendix 2 of this document. <P>In conclusion, I love playing Everquest. You have developed an immersive environment that is generally fun to place, richly detailed, and neat. I have a rich collection of friends and am in a guild that I consider my family. Your attempt to have a real discussion with the player base to fix class imbalances should be commended. My hope is that you seize this opportunity to make real changes in balancing the classes. I have faith that you will do so. Please feel free to contact me in game, email me, or even telephone me if you would like to continue this discussion. Paladins will require some significant revisions to be balanced in the world of Norrath. <P>Valcare Goodfellow<BR>53rd level Cavalier<BR>Officer, Warlords of Wrath<BR>Rodcet Nife Server<P><BR>P.S. If you have read this far, either you skipped to the bottom looking for a conclusion or are quite the persistent reading stud. Assuming the latter, you really should reconsider the reward versus risk on Lady Vox. On fifteen Lady Vox raids, I have seen her die once (she did not drop a scale or paladin book of course). I have died 15 times. On the last raid I organized, I assembled an armada of 70 characters (47-52) to assault Vox. It took 3 days to personally contact and work all the participants. We failed despite mana-sieving her so that she did not get one spell off. We failed despite everyone have cold resist potions, decent resists gear, and a very detailed briefing. It failed despite a very solid tactical plan that you can view at http://warlordsofwrath.homepage.com/vox.htm and critique. We used two wands of conflaguration on her on the raid as well. We did not have a lot of link deaths. While we were very close, she lived and we all died. Some of the brave casters died 4-5 times as they would loot a coin off the ground after they died, mem an attack spell, and go back in naked with guns blazing trying to kill that #$%^@.  Look, revisit Lady Vox given the level constraints on her and rebalance her. I have killed Naggy more than ten times and I have never died on a Naggy raid. I have dealt Naggy the killing blow. I have been in the group that got the experience for killing Naggy. I have attempted Lady Vox fifteen times using vastly superior forces and vastly refined tactics and she beats us everytime. Fix Lady Vox so that she becomes slightly less than impossible - I bet if you raised the level limit of folks that could attack her to 54 she would still win most of the time but at least she would die occasionally. This would also close the gap between when paladins can no longer attack Lady Vox for a frost-covered book and when they become viable for raiding the Kunark dragons. Naggy is fine with a level constraint of 52.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>SUMMARY<BR>-------<P>The most often-repeated and best points I've seen in this forum so far (in no particular order):<P>- Paladins need a Defensive discipline, similar to the one Warriors have.  I think we realize that ours won't be as good as Warriors (perhaps it won't refresh as quickly, or will be a *bit* shorter in duration).<P>- Bash should be a key Paladin/SK skill, as Archery is for Rangers, since we use it more than any other melee class, by far.  Everyone seems to feel that we should be at least as good at it as Warriors (much as Rangers excel at Archery along with Warriors).<P>- The improvements to Defense help a lot, but don't fully make up for the large difference in Armor Class and Hit Points between Warriors and Paladins.  This is less of an issue for Rangers Offense vs Warriors, because their weapons are just as good.<P>- One way to improve our Armor Class is to add better Shields to the game.  Currently, the shields available to Paladins aren't much better than those that were available before Ruins of Kunark.  Weapons have improved dramatically since then, why haven't shields?  I think we're looking for shields with armor class 40 and up, as readily available as the many, many powerful weapons in RoK and SoV.<P>- Fiery Defender is an adequate Epic Weapon, but is perhaps the worst of all meleer weapons in terms of power, and perhaps the least well suited to it's class' needs.  Many people have suggested an optional extension to the Paladin Epic Quest that lets us trade it in for a great Shield and Sword combination (much like the offhand/mainhand sword combination that Rangers have).<P>- Divine Strength is woefully underpowered for a level 60 spell, especially when compared to the level 60 spell that Rangers got with SoV.  Most seem to think it should give more hit points (perhaps 300) AND some Armor Class bonus.  The new low-power level 53 version of the spell, Divine Glory, is also underpowered, especially when compared to the level 51 Ranger spell Strength of Nature.<P>- The new Celestial healing spell is completely useless, and needs to heal at least TWICE as much before any Paladin would use it.<P>- Paladin spells are generally thought to be very well balanced from levels 1-49, so the changes on Test for spells in this range aren't viewed as being very helpful.<P>- Yaulp 4 is such an obvious, natural spell for high level Paladins...many of us really feel it should be made available at the highest level.<P>- The HolyForge discipline is not very helpful, because critical hits in general don't add very much to offense.  Many strongly feel that Paladins should simply get critical hits (beginning at level 55) and critical blows (beginning at level 60) all the time, vs all mobs.  The logical replacement for this discipline is Defensive.<P>- an improved version of Divine Might would be greatly appreciated at higher levels, since for many Paladins it's our best spell, addressing the area where we are weakest:  melee damage.<P>- our Offense and Weapon Skills skill caps are quite low, to the point of not being able to hit many high-level mobs with a significant amount of damage.  Modest increases in these skills seems appropriate.<P>- if Ranger weapons are as good as Warrior weapons, why isn't Paladin (and SK) armor as good as Warrior armor?  This is one of the main issues confronting Paladins, as it prevents them from equalling a Warrior in defense the way a Ranger can equal a Warrior in offense.<P>- new versions of the Lay Hands effect need to be made available at higher levels, because this class-defining ability is trivialized by high-level equipment such as Cleric breastplates that cast complete heal and Celestial Elixir.  How about LayHands2 at level 51, which heals 3000hp every 60 minutes, LayHands3 at level 55 (4000hp every 45 minutes), and LayHands4 at level 60 (5000hp every 30 minutes)?  The same type of change needs to happen to Harm Touch, as well.<P>- will the laughable graphic of Fiery Defender, our ultimate weapon, ever be fixed?<P>- many of what are viewed as our very best spells, such as level 60 Resolution and Shield of Words, which look so wonderful on paper, turn out to be useless in-game because we are ALWAYS grouped with clerics, who have far more powerful spells available to them at the same level.  We need UNIQUE buffs that stack with Cleric buffs (like Divine Strength), or are self-only (like the Yaulp line).<P>- there still seems to be a general lack of weapons available to Paladins.   This trend started in RoK (where we had 3 class-specific, compared to 10 or more for every other melee class), and continues in SoV (where nobody has found a decent Paladin-only weapon to date).<P>Thank you for your time.  Many patient Paladins (including myself) eagerly await Verant's responses to our concerns.<P>Scrith<BR>Level 60 Crusader<BR>Druzzil Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor, I think you garnered a good idea of the general issues with the class in the high level game from previous threads, including my own.  I wanted to touch on some things that are specific to the test server changes to help you tune them to where they need to be to be effective:<P><BR>1. Celestial Line Proposal on Test needs to be reconsidered at Level 59... far too underpowered and mana inefficient when compared to Level 57 Sup Heal.  At this high of a level, theres no purpose in adding a spell Paladins won't use.  Consider Celestial Heal at normal Paladin-to-Cleric 10% penalty, this is, after all, a Level 59 Paladin.<P>2. Divine Strength is the best spell a Paladin gets possibly *ever*, yet it is a Level 60 Spell Drop and is arguably not as good as a Level 51 store bought Ranger spell and DOESN'T STACK.  Either make the proposed Lower Level Version 150-200hp and the lvl 60 one 300-400hp OR make the spells stack as they should.<P>3. Address Level 56+ unstunnable, uninterruptable mobs.  Major blow to the class that spent 49-55 being able to interrupt casters to offset some of the classes' other glaring weaknesses.  No proposed solution... think of something creative whether it be by discipline, bash, or by new spell addition.<P>4. Think of how a high level group is either required or most efficient to have a similarly leveled Cleric along with them.  Address why such a group, the most common in the high level game, would ever want a Paladin in that group.  (This takes 95% of the Paladin's spells out of the balance equation and is an increasingly large problem).<P>5. Your Test Server Changes move Low 50s spells down in rank to make them more usable, yet you keep a Level 60 mark on Resolution and Shield of Words.  Level 60 Paladins never cast these spells currently as far superior, far lower level clerical alternatives that are often group versions OR on clerical armor free of mana, are used.  To tweak the levels of Guard and Armor of Faith, without addressing Shield of Words, for instance, is akin to believing the problems with Paladins are only in their Low 50s.  You have set the groundwork nicely to move Shield of Words to Level 57, for instance, and to add a useful Level 60 armor buff, possibly stackable with the clerical line.  A similar move in Resolution to a lower level with an impending improvement to the Divine Strength Spell at 60 would also be welcome.  <P>6. Large Raid usefulness is tremendously weak, currently.  We group the majority of our EQ lives, just as the Raid-Useful classes do, yet we are shunned at raid time because of our inability to justify the spot we take up.  This point is of MASSIVE importance to high level Paladins and the health of the game in general.<P>We are never at a Warrior's ability to tank, and still are not after the proposed changes on test.  I believe this to be a good thing.  I have focused here on the tweaking of the spell line as a possible counterbalance to the Warrior tanking advantage as well as the massive Warrior offensive advantage.  Other Paladins have suggested increases to our offensive capabilities, and those are valid opinions as well.  <P>In the end, remember that the ability to BOTH TAKE massive damage and to DEAL massive damage AT THE SAME TIME are the reason why Warriors shine in high level play, and will continue to shine if your balance tweaks are done properly.  Your challenge, and it is not an easy one, is to make the Paladin a desirable and viable class in a group and in a large raid.  HOW you choose to do this is eventually up to you, but the need for it to be reasonable and radical should both be of primary concern, given the nature of High Level Everquest, in its current state.<P>Derringer Labyrinth<BR>59 Paladin of Pak'Cafan<BR>Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR><BR>I read nearly every post on the previous thread.  Overall, I think most paladins are pretty happy with the changes on test, but are looking for a little bit more.   The following are my suggested changes to balance the paladin, and fit the image of a holy Warrior.<P>First off all, i consider a paladin without mana to be a sub par warrior.   I think the faith of the paladin is his power, and that faith is represented in his mana bar.  I LOVE the way divine purpose works, by giving me regen so long as I have mana.   As such, some of my ideas revolve around the concept of Faith (i.e. mana) in exchange for a paladins power.<P>First off, contrary to almost ALL of my brother paladins, I HATE disciplines.  I Do NOT think paladins should get a single discipline.  We are Spell casting warriors, and any discipline like effect should be a spell, and take mana.  Period.  We do not study the art of war as our melee cousins do, and should NEVER be as adept at it as they.  That said, i propose:<P>Lvl 51, Resistance of faith<BR>Cost is 1 mana to cast.  20 mana per tic to keep going.  6 minute recast time.  Resistance bonuses granted as per the current discipline.  Decrease the mana per tic 1 per level to 60. <BR>The balance on this is that if we turn it off to conserve mana, we have to wait to reactivate it.  at 60, this will last a considerable amount of time, but constantly takes mana.<P>Lvl 55, Shield of Faith <BR>Cost 1 mana to cast. Cost is 50 mana per tic, decrease 2 mana per level to 50.  Recast 10 minutes.  This provides the following RAID level usefullness.  30 percent of all Incoming attacks are Blocked, ZERO damage.  If a SHIELD is employed, this is increased to 50 percent, since we are taking a defensive stand.  <BR>This is damage mitigation NEEDED for high level raids so we do NOT end up an stain on the floor.  it also gives us a REASON to get agro'd, since we can take the damage for 2 minutes at the highest level.<P>Lvl 30, Holy Rage.  <BR>1 Mana to cast, 3 minute recast.  5 mana used per tic.  Allows a paladin to do critical hits on undead opponents, in line with what warriors can do on all other mobs.  This assists us in being the destroyers of undead.<P>lvl 55, Diving Rage<BR>1 mana to cast.  6 minute recast.  50 mana per tic.  ALL hits on an undead target are double the calculated damage.  Also, there is a per warrior chance to do critical and crippling blows.  This makes us at high levels, an Undead destroyer as described in the manual we all read.<P>Lvl 39, Holy aura (this is NOT a balance issue but fits with the undead slayer image)<BR>1 mana to cast.  10 minute recast.  10 mana per tic.  This is an UNDEAD only damage shield for self, doing 20 damage per hit to undead, increaseing 1 point per level up to 60.  at 60, it will do 41 points of damage per tic on undead only.<BR>Again, I think this fits with the idea of paladins being the slayers of undead, and champions of their deities to slay the unlife.<P>Total mana loss per tic if ALL of these were employed at level 60: 120 mana per tic if fighting undead.  Total time these would last before Out of mana, 1 minute tops.  even with Clarity 2 and a bard, the paladin could not keep up.  But, he would be a holy terror on undead during that time.<P>Get RID of the Disarm skill.  it is offensive in nature.  We are defensive in nature.  Change this to the passive skill BLOCK.  Give warriors the skill Block at lvl 30.  A shield is REQUIRED to use this skill.  Cap at 200 for lvl 50, 252 at 60 for paladins and SK's, and 240 for warriors.<BR>I maintain that shields are to be used defensively.  SK's and paladins are Defensive in nature, and should be able to mitigate damage if they have a shield.   This also helps large raids and general survivability since we can block more blows.<P>Stun.  These are the lifeblood of a paladin.  At lvl 49, we have 2 stuns plus our shield bash.  Used in conjunction, we are very effective at keeping mobs imobile for the group.  At 55+, this is no longer possible.   What I suggest is the following:<BR>For stun based spells:  Chance to interupt a mob casting ONLY - 30% +/- (PC lvl - Mob Lvl) * 10<BR>A lvl 63 mob would STILL be totally unstunnable.  Cap this at a max of 80 percent for a mob 5 levels below the PC.   <BR>For Stun based Shield Bash:  All PC's capable of Shield bash have - 50% +/- (PC lvl - mob lvl) *10<BR>chance of stunning the mob.  Cap this at 80 percent.  A mob of lvl 63, would have a 20 percent chance of being stunned by a lvl 60 paladin, sk, or warrior.   This will help with party selection because with a shield bash, they CAN interupt a spell.  ALSO, since bash and Kick are exclusive, a warrior would have to sacrifice Kick damage to they can swap out a shield quickly and attempt to bash a mob.  Paladins and SK's would now have a reason to go on large raids...interupts, AND, with the Shield of Faith spell, would be able to mitigate the agro caused.<BR>For balance, i would make a successful Shield bash interrupt a HUGE agro on mobs.<P>Increase Bash for paladins slightly post 50, i suggest to 200, possibly 210.  As it is an offensive use of a defensive weapon, it should NEVER reach warriors ability.<P>The only other point I think needs to be addressed from a balance perspective is the weapon and shield selection.  Paladins should have a High level 1hs weapon DESIGNED to be used as a 1 hander, NON dual wielded.  Something on the order of 28dmg 40 dly, or even 30 dmg 40 dly.  This allows us to cast spells between swings, do decent damage, AND maximize the 1 handed damage bonus.  <BR>Give us a SINGLE upgrade which is questable.  Something like others have suggested.  Lichbane, or deaths bane.  Have it come for the Shin Lord in Guk, where we turn in Ghoulbane (PLEASE MAKE THIS SWORD QUESTABLE), and say a symbol of the devout.  The symbol of the devout is a necklace container which requires the following to be included and combined.  Gem of Brell, Gem of Tunare, Gem of Marr, Gem of Rodcet Knife, Gem of Quellious, and Gem of Prexus.  Each gem would in turn be questable by a lvl 45+ paladin.  The combined necklece of the devout is turned in with ghoulbane to give us lichbane, a 28dmg 40 dly, effect banish undead.  If you are REALLY nice, give us back the necklace of the devout.  Heck, make us turn in older paladin weapons, shield of the silent watch, holy partisan of underfoot, messenger of the queen, and so on.<P>Alternatively, let us turn in ANY paladin Only 2 handed weapon along with a diamond, and have it converted into a 1hs weapon with the SAME stats and graphics as the original.  (This would be an addition of about 10 lines in the database)<P>Just my thoughts.   <P>wyrmbane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055491-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055491-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055491-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055491-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055491-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055491-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055491-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055491&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055491&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
