</FONT><HR>I have to agree that putting level limits on items would fix alot of the farming, and class specific armor being rolled for by someone for a twink.  If that weapon wasn't usable for 30 levels why would they bother rolling?  Anyway, the answer is in level limiting items.  It would have to be a within a few levels as it would harder to sell items.  (e.g. Minotaur Axe) for example, not an over powering example of an item but drops off a ~level 18 mob - shouldn't have a level limit at all.  But quest armor for classes should - Most class specific armor can't be obtained til level 30 or so, which would keep level 1s out of it til level 25 at least by putting a level 25 requirement on the items.<P>Just my idea of how things should be.  (No more selling items on EBay to twinks if level limits were imposed.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>ok i would like to make TWO points here<P>1)  i do not beleive in twinking.  helping sure twinking no<P>2) Benedor was a total ass to me and LIED to me and caused me to die.  a great high elf mage by the name of Castius gave me help.  he gave me 10 platnium to go shopping with and 50 to start my guild.  His friend Fiaera gave me a runed totem staff (at first level) why?  because i stood up to this creep anyway (hes a pk and saying hes level 5 when hes level 10)<P>3) my level 7 enchanter has a lover who is a powerful wizard.  yeah hes twinking me i guess you would call it.  Runed staff, dagger of dropping, skull of jhen tra, gossimyr robe BUT im on my own with these and i have died SO MANY FREAKING TIMES (i dont use pets - not my characters style).  its all in roleplaying.  and its not all at once.  he'll be off fighting and he'll come back to nerriak and say 'Vendui my love (hello in darke elf), i have brought you a gift from battle' and he'll proceed to make up some story about it and give it to my character<P>is THAT twinking or roleplaying?  you lll say 'twinking your disguising as roleplaying'  true MAYBE but YOU Think back to when someone helped you out in a tight spot or roleplayed like that and you see if it twinking</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I suppose I'll chime in on the pro-twinking side.<P>I twink, I don't hide it.  Heck, I uber twink, and you know what?  No one in game has ever said anything about it, it hasn't prevented me from getting groups or given me preference in groups either.  The main difference for me is that I don't twink my characters til after level 10, usually around level 12.  Why?  Because I want to learn the class first.  This doesn't entitle me to twink because I have "put in my time", it is just my own arbitrary point.  I was also one of the people who suffered from equipment envy for a while, then I got over it, then I moved to a different server, started naked and got to a higher level.  Once there, I decided to see what other classes/races were like. <P>[The above isn't quite true, a higher level SK was looking at me weird for being a level 15 SK with full darkforge, but I told him who my other character was (we had grouped several times) and his response was "okay, cool, nice to see you playing a shadow knight."]<P>I am amused by this whole string of threads on twinking and how it is morally wrong or wrong from a game perspective etc etc.  <P>Why do I twink?  Several reasons.  <BR>-The first is that I like doing quests, its fun.  This is probably the main reason that I have a bard with more play time than a lot of the level 50's around and I am in my mid-30's.  <BR>-A lot of the time the quest item may rot on the corpse.  I play mostly during off peak, so I am not depriving anyone of the quest items (for the most part, I'll come to this again later).  This relates closely to the first reason for twinking, and for the one following.  <BR>-I like to try out the different classes.  I have played every class except for the paladin.  Once I get around to twinking, I can play and enjoy the class (more) because I don't have to do the naked guy scramble for equipment.  So what if I make a sudden shift from a regular robe (or leather, or bronze) to decent equipment?<BR> Twinking doesn't give me much of an advantage, but the advantage is there... I have slightly less downtime that I did before I twinked.  I still die lots, and I still have to be careful.  I attribute my success to being reasonably intelligent and learning the class a bit before I twink.  <BR>-My playing style is a preference for soloing.  I solo'd, for the most part, on MUDs when I played those, and I solo in EQ a lot. And before anyone tells me that I can't solo without twinking, you are utterly wrong.  I have solo'd 3 characters to 20 (at least) without twinking.  It's around the mid 20's that I have to stop soloing (whether I have twinked equipment or not, it is a flaw in the game design as far as I am concerned), which is a shame.  I don't have anything against grouping, and I do it for a change of pace, or if someone wants to share a spawn with me.<BR>-I also twink just for the looks of the items.  This last part is pretty shallow, but some of the stuff just looks far too cool. <P>The above are my personal reasons.  As a character I always try to play nice with others.  I share spawns if needed, and if I have camped/killed something needed for a quest when all I was doing in that area was looking for the critter for the quest and someone comes looking for it, I'll stick around and help them kill it when it pops up next if they want the help.  <P>I think this particular thread was started by someone complaining that he lost a dragoon dirk when he dropped it.  Guess what?  They do that when you drop them, they did a year ago when I lost mine.  I accidentally dropped the pack that I use to store my instruments/weapons for swapping. I had grabbed the pack rather than opening it(left rather than right click), and missed the edge of the hot box that I was using for that inventory slot, so it fell to the ground, I did this now and again with instruments or weapons when swapping too. I am terribly thankful to Verant for finally putting in the drop confirmation.  When I picked the pack up less than 3 seconds after dropping it, the dirk was gone.  I filed a bug report, then went a bought a combine longsword with the money I had in the bank.   The point to this story?  <P>Get over it, it's a game.  <P>The same can be said to people on both sides of this arguement.   Anti-twinkers are deluded in thinking either 'if I can't, no one should be able to', 'if I don't, no one should, that it somehow ruins balance or gives an extreme advantage and finally that people of a low level can't possibly have earned the items.  Having played twinked and untwinked, I can assure you that it does not matter much either way, the balances that Verant puts in pretty much takes care of that.  Also, for an enterprising individual, there are many ways to make money.  Heck, I made a few hundred plat long ago selling language lessons.  The pro twinkers are deluded in thinking that they have 'earned' the right to twink or that all the anti-twinkers are just jealous.  I believe in a lot of cases that it isn't jealousy, it is a feeling that low levels with 'higher' gear somehow trivializes their accomplishments in getting to their higher level (or the gear that they have). It doesn't, you still have your accomplishments.  <P>Your opinions are just that, opinions, Just as these are my opinions, and I have a feeling that I will probably get flamed for them.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> There is no right or wrong on this issue, it's pretty much all grey.  Twink if you want, don't twink if you don't want, live and let live.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well, to end what has become a long and rambling thread with jerks like Jedi telling me to stop telling them how to play the game I will say this:<P>I TWINK!!!<P>Yes, that's right, I twink my characters and I'm on here arguing against it.  Can your 12 year old brains contemplate that???  I'm NOT jealous of you, because I do the exact same thing!  Gee, kinda blows your whole you're just jealous argument out of the water, ey?  Do you not understand the concept that is possible to have an opinion that something is damaging to the long term health of the game, regardless of how I play??  Personally, I am going to take advantage of the same exploits (which is what I consider twinking) that everyone else is using because while I will argue that it's bad for the overall game, I'm not going to hold myself at a disadvantage because of an opinion.  If Verant chooses not to address it that's fine.  I'm going to take advantage of whatever the gameplay currently allows, and twinking is one of those things.<P>So for all of you twinkers who say, "you don't know what you're talking about", "you're just jealous", "we're not affecting anyone else", I have one word; BS!  I've played a twinked character and I can plainly see the huge advantage you have over a naked level 1 character who has nothing.  And for the guy who said that if you give a level 1 character a huge weapon but he can't hit with it, you're making a stupid example that you know doesn't have anything to do with real gameplay.  Anyone who twinks knows what level weapons and armor they can equip on a character without screwing up their skill caps.  There are PLENTY of pieces of armor and weapons you can put on a char at level 1 that will make him unhittable to anything within 5 levels of him.  Have you not heard of +DEX/AGI/STR items?  Those aren't nerfed for low level chars.  Neither are high AC items.  And on and on.  Face it, you're all arguing against twinks because it makes YOUR gameplay easier and you want to powerlevel through the game.  I will state it again; just because you CAN do it, DOES NOT mean the game was designed for level 1 characters to have level 30+ armor and equipment.  If it was designed that way then I'm sure you could just go take down a hill giant at level 1 and get them yourself...

</FONT><HR>This goes out to KidF, who has seemingly not played EQ for very long. Do you realize that it takes HOURS of real time to camp an item?<P>I spent 16 HOURS on one item. Yes, SIXTEEN (six hours on one camp and ten hours on another before it dropped). Which, btw, is a no drop item. In that time I also picked up some extra armor that I could not use, and had no room to bank. I gave away HALF of it to others, then used the rest to create a new warrior. My right to use as I will.<P>Do you even understand that THIS is the time I will never have again for something as trivial as this?<P>Since you fail to understand things when written once: This means, I did have this time once, I no longer have it. Real life has taken its toll. I do not have time to camp for these things for new characaters. No more time. How may ways must I say this before it sinks in?<P>You have no clue as to how I play this game, why I play it, nor who I am. Do not attempt to describe me nor read between the lines of my post.<P>IF you knew me in game, you would realize that I am exactly the opposite of what you posted. And yes, your arrogance has pissed me off, because I am sick of people like you twisting my words as they please.<P>I do not BUY items, I camp for them.

</FONT><HR>-"This goes out to KidF, who has seemingly not played EQ for very long. Do you realize that it takes HOURS of real time to camp an item?"<P>Wrong. I have played EQ for well over a year and I know exactly how long it takes to camp an item.  And your point would be???<P>-"This means, I did have this time once, I no longer have it. Real life has taken its toll. I do not have time to camp for these things for new characaters. No more time. How may ways must I say this before it sinks in?"<P>Ok, so let me get this straight, cuz I'm kinda slow...  You don't have time to camp for good items anymore because of RL, so you have determined that it's your right to use exploits like muling to give items that one character earned to a character who didn't earn them.  Gee, I don't have a lot of time either, and by your reasoning if I can dupe items, or buy stuff on Ebay I should do that because it will save me time and I won't have to do all that boring camping stuff...  <P>Do you not grasp the concept that each character on the server is a DIFFERENT and UNIQUE persona???  Let me repeat again for you, there is nothing in the game that allows you to transfer items from one of your characters to another because you WANT to.  You have to use other players or exploits to do it.  Period.  You earned the items on one character, doing one set of actions.  Fine, play that character.  Give away the items to other players in game.  Sell the items.  Whatever.  That's why they built a little function called /auction.  I have no problems with any of  that.  But pretending like you have a right not to have to earn the items again with another character is a strange leap of logic.  Did you get a manual that said once you build up one character then you get to use all those items for future characters?  I must have missed that in the gameplay notes...<P>-"Don't knock the reasons I enjoy the game. What I enjoy is my right, and I do not have to enjoy what you enjoy. Understand?"<P>No, again you fail to comprehend the most basic concept of a multiplayer game.  What you enjoy is not your "right".  How hard is this to grasp???  Let's say I enjoy ks'ing, or taunting, or just messing with people (I don't btw).  Let's assume that's what gives me enjoyment (and there are plenty of people like that).  Is that my right?  Do I get to play the game however I want to, with no regard for how it affects other players?  What if my vision of the game is different from yours and by pursuing my vision I am hurting your gameplay experience.  Is that fine??  No, of course not.  Why do you not understand that??  You don't have a "right" to do anything in this game.  And if I am telling you that level 1 characters running around in plate armor, ruining the economy, and unbalancing the gameplay, is affecting my gaming experience you can bet your ass that Verant will factor that in to future developments.  I'm sorry if that bothers you and you think this is your little world to play in.  I suggest you go get a single player RPG or something like Diablo II.  Because that is a game you can buy, you can own, and you can do whatever the hell you want.  You CANT do that in EQ.  Sorry..<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Apollohades:<BR>I'm sorry you can't respond to my posts without claiming I'm a troll.  I have made numerous valid points in the hundreds of posts about twinking in the past.  Those who know me understand I don't agree with twinking.  When you decide to hold an intellectual discussion on the subject let me know.  I've listened to all the posts from the pro-twinkers and can't find 1 reason to justify twinking.  So unless you have some ground-breaking reasons to add, I don't feel I need to justify my position to you on this board.  I would be interested to know which of my statements you considered to be "trolling."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The problem and the cause is simple:<P>Items don't EVER wear out.<P>Yeah, that's right... I can use my Runed Blade from 1st level to 60th and it will still have the exact same stats.  Same thing for my Crafted Armor or my rings.  They will never wear out and need to be replaced.<P>What this means is that when I no longer need these items because I received better items, then I have the choice of either selling for plat (wasting my already scant time) or giving it away to someone that would LOVE me for it.  I have yet to find anyone who didn't thank me profusely for the items that I have given them.  They will send me tells for weeks about how much they love the item and how it makes them enjoy the game more.<P>You might wonder how this applies to my point about items not wearing out... well, there are probably somewhere around 4000-5000 people who play regularly on Solusek Ro every day (various times).  The FBSS spawn comes around every 8 hours I believe, maybe more, maybe less.  This means that around 2.5 enter the game every day.  We'll say that it isn't camped for around 4 hours a day.  That means that 17 FBSSs enter the game every week and 884 every year.  The game has been out for nearly 2 years now... we'll say that there are nearly 1400 FBSSs in the game now.  This means that because they never wear out, around 1/3 of the players on Solusek Ro have an FBSS.  Since approximately 1/3 of the people who are on a server (even though they play many characters) are of the warrior subset (war, shd, pal, rng, mnk), this would mean that every warrior type playing could have one easily if people didn't twink.<P>Obviously if every main warrior had an FBSS, the cost of the item would plummet quickly, same for every single item.  The items will continue to lose value as any server becomes more 'mature', as there are more of the items entering the game and nearly none of them being taken out of the game.  Even if items simply wore down over time (lower haste %, lower damage, higher delay, weaker proc, etc...), then the value of the higher level (indeed even mid-level items) would maintain much better.<P>Twinking does not ruin the economy, if anything, it keeps it healthy as the items are removed from the general population and put on characters that are either rarely or nearly never played.  What ruins the in-game economy is the fact that items never have to leave the game.  Items only leave the game when someone gets either forgetful and lets their corpse decay, they destroy the item, or they quit the game and don't give away their items to in-game friends.  All 3 of these events is very rare and probably happens less than twice per day on any server involving a character above level 10.<P>Imagine you bought a VCR and it never wore out.  You would nearly never buy a new one and the market would drop out on them.  In the real world, either fewer VCRs would be made, or the price would drop drastically.  Both of these have happened with VCRs, even though they wear out after a time.  Think about that boy with the Hummer, if it didn't wear out ever, then he could use it forever and the market would drop out on vehicles, one only being bought for aesthetic reasons or because the previous one being involved in a wreck which ruined it.  This is how economy works.  Things wear out and go bad in the real world and a decent amount of the economy is based upon replacement of these worn out pieces of equipment.  This is where Verant made a mistake.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
