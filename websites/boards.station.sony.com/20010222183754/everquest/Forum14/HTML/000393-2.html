</FONT><HR>Problem:<P>Espri, the druid quest Scimitar in the Plane of Sky.<P>Espri<BR>MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP <BR>Skill: 1HS  Atk Delay: 23<BR>DMG: 10<BR>+9 DEX, +9 WIS, +50 MANA<BR>Effect: Combust<BR>WT: 2.0<BR>Class: DRU<BR>Race: ALL<P>All in all its a very nice item and in my opinion worth the efford. The only thing that bugs me is the effect. It is a Proc. <BR>We need to be level 46 to enter the plane and more likely be post 50 to finaly obtain all the items to finish the quest. This is a level a druid simply wont meele. I personly havent meeled for damage since level 30. The problem here is that we get a weapon which is one of the few Scimitars which give a +Wisdom for druids and the quest is hard. And with it we get an effect which is almost useless at the level we are able to obtain it. I realy think this effect should be a rightclick regarding the risk and time you take and invest to obtain the Item.<BR>It took the first druid a fairly long time to finish the quest, ( a few weeks ago i saw it finaly completet) with all this time it is kinda disapointing to see the effect almost useless.<P>Scimitars in Generall<P>Im realy missing some +Wisdom scimitars in the Mid 30th. All scimitars i know of are the following:<P>Tunarian Scimitar (PoH, Innoruk, 46+ )<BR>Skyfury Scimitar (Skyshrine, 45+, Faction Hits)<BR>Epic Scimitar (quest, 50+)<BR>Espri (PoA, 46+, quest)<P>As you can see, there are 4 scimitars in game which are all VERY hard to obtain. Currently as a druíd you have the choice of training 1 or 2hand Blunt and get a wisdom bonus in your Hand slots, or you train 1 hand Slash and end up with no Wisdom or Mana bonus in your primary hand. Every other class gets a few mid level items which refer to their primary stat for every weapon skill they have. Druids are missing it. How about putting the Oaken Scimitar back into game? As far as i know the item was removed in Beta because it was obtained due to an Exploit. Now after almost 3 years, dont you think there is a way to make a new quest or whatever and give the druids their Scimi back? :-)<P>-------------------------------------------------<P>Vermiculated and ES armor weight:<P>Yes it is to heavy. I made a list just in case noone did bevore. In this case i compared Indicolite to Vermiculated and Cobalt to Elder Spiritis Armor. I used one item in each slot without taking the Bracer double. <P>Cobalt armor:<BR>Helm: 10,0<BR>Boots: 6,5<BR>Gauntlets: 5,0<BR>Greaves: 7,5<BR>Bracer: 4,0<BR>Vambracers: 6,5<BR>Breastplate: 20,0<BR>Total Strength Bonus: +20<BR>Total weight without Strength Bonus: 59,5<BR>Total weight with Strength Bonus: 39,5<P>Elder Spiritist's Armor<BR>Helm: 6,0<BR>Boots: 6,5<BR>Gauntlets: 5,0<BR>Greaves: 7,5<BR>Bracer: 4,0<BR>Vambracers: 6,5<BR>Breastplate: 10,0<BR>Total Strength Bonus: +6<BR>Total weight without Strength Bonus: 45,5<BR>Total weight with Strength Bonus: 39,5<P>Indicolite Armor<BR>Helm: 4,5<BR>Boots: 4,9<BR>Gauntlets: 3,8<BR>Greaves: 5,6<BR>Bracer: 3,0<BR>Vambracers: 4,9<BR>Breastplate: 7,5<BR>Total Strength Bonus: +32<BR>Total weight without Strength Bonus: 34,2<BR>Total weight with Strength Bonus: 2,2<P>Vermiculated Armor<BR>Helm: 6,0<BR>Boots: 6,5<BR>Gauntlets: 5,5<BR>Greaves: 7,0<BR>Bracer: 3,5<BR>Vambracers: 5,0<BR>Breastplate: 9,0<BR>Total Strength Bonus: 17<BR>Total weight without Strength Bonus: 42,5<BR>Total weight with Strength Bonus: 25,5<P>As you can see, Cobalt armor is sligthly heavier bevore we adjust the Strength boni of the Armor, but after the adjustment we come to the same weight. Although i can understand that warriors get more strength, (beeing one of their primary stats) i wonder why Vermiculated has the same outcome weight as the Warriors armor. <P>For Indicolite and vermiculated its a joke. vermiuclated is Heavier then Indicolite bevore AND after adding the Strength Boni of the Armor. <P>To me it doesnt only seem that the druid specific armor is to heavy, it is a fact. Please have a look at this. Im tired of keeping My strength buff up and still being encumbred while wearing only my armor and standart equipment.<P>-------------------------------------------------<P>thanks for your Time.<P>Lysiander Schattenwald<BR>52nd Wanderer of Ayonae Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hmmm the issue with rings...<P>There is a ring in Gfay and with SoW and a short run across a small run one can be in Lfay very quickly.. don't really see the need for Lfay AND Gfay portals.. Gfay would be nice.. ring is already there.<P>Warsliks Woods.. this one is imho a must.  You wanted to make underused Zones and dungeons more acccessible.. put a portal in Warsliks.. takes you nice and close into Dalnir an excellent and underused dungeon.. Make it a level 29 spell or at the most level 34 as those are the ideal levels to be playing in those areas.. you don't see the point of WW or other portals from a game play point of view?  <P>Every class has access to druids.. if you are regularly grouping with an Iksar and he wants to visit his home to pick something up or train in certain things (disarm comes to mind) they have one hell of a journey to get home.. pretty much everyone else has a nice easy means to get home (with of course the exception of Qeynos, however Freeport will suffice for human types at a push) but the poor iksar, hated by all but so loved to group with has a murderous journey to get home unless he is at the very least around the level 40 mark.<P>Running from Dreads at level 34 is extremely hazardous and it's one hell of a long run to The Overthere (ideal place to be playing at that level)from the Dreads portal.. not to mention getting to Warsliks Woods.. it's a minimum of 3 zone long run.. right down the middle of a level 40ish zone where things see through invis and run like the clappers after you casting and whacking on you.  Having low hp's as a druid (in comparison to others) couple of hits.. "you have been repeatedly slain by a big nasty monster in 2 hits LOADING PLEASE WAIT"<P>The number of level 34 / 40 people who ask me to port them to DL, and if they are friends often ask me to run them through for safety, is huge.. sure one could just sit in Butcher and wait half an hour for a shuttle which after zoning is all too easy to fall off.  If you are a caster with gate this isn't too disasterous.. sink to the bottom and gate out.. sit and wait for the shuttle again.  If you are of the ilk that you can't gate.. well the choice is swim and watch your stamina fade to nothingness.. watch yourself drown and have a nice little CR.<P>Give us a portal in WW PLEASE!  The trees make nice rings.. there are enough trees in that nasty place (nasty cos the trees hurt my PC a lot) to be able to stick a spot in.. the zone edge at The Overthere springs to mind.. the trees by the water where the stone markers are pointing to Dalnir also spring to mind.. Look at the Emerald Jungle.. where is the ring there?  A nice little spot anywhere in that zone would do nicely (obviously not like you did with iceclad and in the middle of a set of very aggro mobs)<P>Please please please please give us a portal spot to Warsliks.. think of the poor iksar returning home and the rest of us who would like to get to The Overthere.<P>Cheers<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Why you're not going to see SoW2:<P>1) Mobs will also get this spell and will be casting it indoors.  It's hard enough to pull the SoW'd ones as it is.<BR>2) There are times when a bard is necessary.  For instance you want to pull a mob that runs faster than SoW and wolf form, yet you need a tracker.  This would dethrone the bards as good pullers of mobs like Doom in Trak's Teeth.<BR>3) This topic has already been brought up many times before and VI has stated that faster running spells essentially make their game world seem smaller than it really is.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ports: Please add the wind of the north/south issue, and allow the ports to be casted anywhere.<P>Post 50 Group Issue:  Healing will help, but no other suggestions have been included in the list other than increasing the drop rate of Ro's Fiery Sundering.  Some other ideas are:<P>1.  Have level 58 upgrade to Ro's Fiery Sundering and make it cold based(ie, spell reduces cold resistance and the spell lands similar to a lure).  This would let druids help with both major types of wizard nukes/lures for raids and allow druids to use frost better (obtained at level 57).  This would help with the desirability of druids in groups/raids, especially in Velious where mobs are very resistant.  Why level 58 - druids mainly run into trouble grouping at the higher levels, druids only get 3 spells at this level (same with 59), and the spell would help with frost which was recently obtained at 57.  <P>2. Remove the outdoor only restriction to Breath of Karana (level 56 stun).  Druids in velious got a new indoor stun at 34, why not allow breath of karana to also be used indoor?  Since stuns have a recast time, having 2 stuns would allow druids to truly help stun spellcasting mobs in groups indoors.<P>3.  Druids have a nice caster buff at 60 but their melee line was not extended past group wolf form ;p.  Make a single target, high level wolf form buff similar to enchanter targetable werewolf buff Boon of the Garou (ie, it needs to have enough stat bonuses to make melee person actually want it).  The wolf form should give sow, an attack bonus slightly less than form of hunter (around 55-60), ultravision, and stat bonuses either to stamina or dexterity (in the 50-100 range similar to Boon).  It also needs to be able to stack with major tank buffs like focus.  Since the spell is only castable outdoors and doesnt have a lifetap, it doesnt need as steep of recast time as Boon of Garou (only a slight recast time would be needed like 15 sec or so).  The spell could be 60th and Form of the Hunter (self only wolf form at 60th) would still be useful for druids because Hunter has like 2 hours duration while the new buff would have a short duration similar to boon of the garou (somewhere between 6-12 minutes or so).  Finally, to distinguish the spell perhaps make the target a completely white wolf?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Please...._no_ SoW2 - my poor halfling druid has permanent black eyes already, from running into stuff, and I am only level 20. As long as I am smart, I have yet to find a situation where I need to go even faster.<P>I also agree with an earlier post, that the only thing here to make druids more group friendly is the potential change to SuperHeal. <P>My druid is pretty perfect as it is. I use this character when I want to log in and play knowing I might have to log out in less than an hour. Or if I want to pair with a friend but don't want to find a full group. Sure, xp is slow on low blues(when not kiting in NK), but the point is not to hit 60 as fast as possible. The point is to have fun playing.<P>Too many people worry about getting the uber loot, and it seems Verant listens to them far more than they listen to those of us that think the classes(yes, all of them) are fine as is. Maybe it's because the "133t d00d5" are more apt to post and whine here that those that are just enjoying the game as it is presented to us. <P>Whatever. I'll still play all my characters. They'll still be fun, no matter what 'balancing' is done to them. And the flaming and whining will never stop. I think Verant's biggest mistake was making these boards such an interactive and integral part of their development process. <P>Classes should _not_ be balanced. <P>Yeah, go ahead, read that last sentence again. <P>A real world explanation, followed by the EQ equivalent(bear in mind that I play and love my druid more than any other character): <P>Say you have a leaky faucet - you could call a plumber or a 'handyman'. The plumber is expensive and he probably won't be able to patch that drywall crack while he's there, but the handy man probably can, and he'll touch up the paint too. The smart call is the handyman since you need more than just the plumber's expertise. <P>On the other hand, say you have cracked pipes and your toilet is overflowing....well, the handyman probably won't cut it here. You better call the specialist - the drywall can wait, dark water on your floor can't. You can still call the handyman to come out for the drywall, but you definitely need a real plumber for the pipes. <P>Here, the first scenario is a bit like general hunting in a less than full group where a secondary healer will definitely help, but the buffs and snare are likely a bigger plus. <BR>The second is more like a planes raid, where if you don't have at least one real cleric, you might as well camp. <P>Each class has it's area of expertise, and it should stay that way. If all characters are essentially equal, there's no need for distinct classes and we can just call this UltimaQuest. If you want to be sought out for plains raids, play one of the core classes everyone wants for those(cleric, warrior, enchanter). If you want to be able to pop into Norrath for an hour and look for that quest item your friend has been hunting for 6 weeks(alligator skin does not drop correctly, btw) then play a druid, who can self port by 19, track at 20, and solo very effectively, even for very short periods of time. <P>How many classes can log in for less than 1 hour and get something done? <P>I'll stop rambling now, I just had to get that off my chest. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One solution to the SoW2 thing is to put Spirit of Cheetah back like it was before it was "fixed".  SoC used to refresh when you zoned so you could cast it again without waiting the 10 minutes for a refresh.  This won't help much in Kunark or Velious due to the size of some of the zones but in the old world, it was a nice way to move around.<P>Silvana<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Trowt, I agree that each class should be different and unique but your comment about playing one of the "core" classes if you want to go on raids does not seem to be fair for the following reason:<P>Before the expansions almost all the classes could contribute on major raids. This has changed as pre-50 was more balanced then post 50. Add to this the change to the world in which mobs hit harder, have more hit points and are tactics are often needed.<P>I guess what I am getting at is that the world changed as well as allowing classes to exceed 50. The core classes which were highly desired pre-50 changed from desired to required to account for the chaneg to the world.<P>Each class should have a secondary class who can do perhaps half of what the main class can do as well as each class having some unique roll in major raids.<P>Why are major raids important all of a sudden? Well because the post 50 game is so raid oriented. In the Old World a party of 6 could pretty much do anything besides a few of the highest level encounters. In Kunark you started to see entire zones or encounters require major raids and in Velious almost half of the expansion requires major raids.<P>I, myself, would rather the game have less major multi-group raid areas or zones and more "Karnor's Castle" type zones in which a group of 6 can hunt successfully.<P>Many of us picked our class very carefully but did so based on the Old World game mechanics and not Kunark or Velious. I fail to see how it is fair to ask those who have put in hundreds of hours of play time building up their characters to have to start over and play one of the four required classes in the game if they wish to play effectively or contribute to raids.<P>In closing I predict that in a VERY short time you will begin to see a glut of the main, newly "required" classes as those racing to high level for raids mature. Most are still in their mid levels but shortly you might find Warriors, Clerics, Enchanters begging for groups instead of Druids LOL.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well this is a sad list Absor.<P>Most of these suggestions are pointless.<BR> <BR>Emotes for wolfform - woopdeedoo. How about fixing illusions so they actually work? I could care less if I can wag my tail compared to removing agro with non wolfkilling npcs. <P>More port rings on Faydwer - how silly. The best place for a port ring would be close to Halas/Qeynos.<P>You fail to address anything of value to make druids more group desirable at high lvls.<BR>Making sup heal fizzle a little less and available a few lvls earlier is not significant.<BR>If druids had increased sneak and hide skills, which makes sense since they are in tune with nature and their surroundings/master of outdoors, then they could help with CR in high lvl areas.<P>Scrap the scale spells since no one will risk it dropping. Cheetah is too short a duration so no one uses it either. SoW2 would be great. Best idea listed.<P>I am so tired of the class envy whiners crying about quad-kiting. What they fail to realize, cause they are so simple, is that druids will lvl just as fast without quad-kiting. Scrap quad-kiting so they can move on to their next class envy whine.<P>Alchemy is a trade skill that druids should have. This would make things more fun and is something druids were able to do in real life history.<P>Charming animals is useless unless the duration is increased. Way back when, when Verant finally released info on stats, they never said what determines success and duration of animal charms. It was only stated that cha controlled charming ability for enchanters and bards.<BR>I have tested halfling druids and wood elf druids and found no significant change in ability due to cha. <P>Why is it some animals are non kos while others are? I never understood this and have never heard a plausible explanation. Dire wolves and polar bears in permafrost are kos, yet other wolves and bears are not? Cougers and lions are kos, yet leopards and plains cats are not? Let's have some freakin consistency. RPG goes out the window without it. If the concern is that it is a balancing issue, then create faction loss for druids who choose to hunt specific animals, and thus loose that advantage.<P>Something that should be fixed for all classes is the inaccurate conning while invis and not invis.<BR>Examples like Hill giants conning agro while I am invis, yet they can't see me, and gorge hounds/dark stalkers conning kos while I am visible, yet they do not.<P>FIX SHAKEY HEAD QUEST!<P>WHERE IS THE OAK SCIMITAR!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ITEM: GROUP SUPERIOR CAMO<P>DESCRIPTION:  Is this spell in the game?  If not, it should be.  This is a spell that groups often ask druids if they have, and is a nice, but not overpowering, group enhancer for druids.<P>STATUS: None<P>P.S. Folks, remember that there's little point in long rehashes of what we've discussed before.  This is the list that Absor has distilled.  It's not reallyw orth commenting on things he has on the list already unless we have helpful additions or corrections.   He's also looking for stuff that is NOT on there, but these additions need to be strong.  Let's try to present our suggestions in something close to his format to make it a bit easier for him to slog through (remember how many of these threads are out there).  <P>P.P.S. A short comment on the quad kiting issue. The 20 mob number for a group to do better than quad kiting assumes that the group is killing mobs of the same level as the druid.  Obviously, since the druid/wizard has to go for lower level blues in order to be successful (the mobs have to have low enough HP that the druid/wizard can kill them with the AoE DD by straight blasting), this is probably not true.  A group of 6 can go after mob several levels higher than the druid/wizard, and thus the actual equivalent kill requirement is significantly lower for the group.  <P>In essence, the druid/wizard is accepting a long downtime, a bit more risk (longer time to make the kills increases chances of going LD or making mistakes or picking up adds, more mobs result in greater damage and likelihood of stuns when being hit due to misjudgments or lag), and fewer XP/mob in order to kill three more mobs.  <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What I cannot figure out is the things that were on the preliminary list did not make it to the "final" draft here.<P>I feel we have wasted countless hours if all we have accomplished is to move Superior Heal from 53 to 51. What about all the druids from 46-50 who go on high level raids? If Verant does not want to give Superior Heal to us until 51 I can think of only one reason... to make it so that you have to buy Kunark (has anyone NOT bought kunark?) as you need to buy Kunark to break the level 50 cap. I know it seems silly but I can see no other reason as they want to keep it above the original game levels. What possibly unbalancing thing would there be by dropping it to 49 or 44 like everyone is in agreement that we need. The only other reason I can think of is to keep the number of Druids who can get the spell low. Now while that's fine for me as I am 53 now it still is not fair for the Druids who fianlly made planes level to be passed over as they have nothing to contribute until they made 51.<P>Now before anyone says that all we are doing is whining and asking for more... maybe dropping it to 51 would be ok if there were other fixes and enhansments to the list like the other classes are getting but no... the only REAL thing on the list is Superior Heal being moved. All that other stuff is really fluff and does nothing for the end "raid" game. Giving us an extra spell or two at 55 or 60 may be nice for the one or two percent of Druids that make that level but it does nothing to address the overwhelming concern almost EVERY Druid presented...<P>THE ADDITION OF THINGS A DRUID CAN TO IN GROUPS AND ON MAJOR RAIDS!<P>I consider high level above 44 and I look at the list of things that are proposed here to help Druids in Groups and the only thing I see is Superior Heal moved two levels down.<P>I'm sorry if I seem a bit upset but for something that started out so positive (Druids spoke with an almost universal voice and did not whine or ask for overpowering things) to see some of the things asked for crossed off and replaced with fluff like more wolfform animations and basically bug fixes seems a bit of a slap in the face.<P>Half the list are bug fixed or serious oversights that we have brought to Verants attention. Besides bumping up Superior Heal to 51 from 53 (A step in the right direction) the rest will do nothing to help Druids in their groups like we asked. For those Druids under 51 enjoy your new Wolfform emotes and good luck with the....<P>44th-50th Season Druid LFG.... 44th-50th Season Druids LFG.... 44th-50th Season Druid LFG!<P>It does not take a rocket scientist to see what is happening here. Once again Verant is dictating work on classes based on the number of people playing them. Look at the other class lists... See many new emotes being asked for? BTW Who the heck even asked for new Wolfform Emotes? I thought I read all the requests... must have missed the dozens of posts asking for new emotes and the other silly stuff.<P>In closing I guess I am sick and tired of things being done with NO explanation. If you want to go over each item (like you origianlly were!) and say yes or no and say why... then this is fair but MANY items you said you would ask for did not make this list. Why?<P>And yes new port locations are MUCH needed and would be welcome but they also do nothing to help our grouping ability and in fact (wizards will also get some I think) will help the entire game and not Druids as a class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

A drawback in this is already built in, most dungeons have ledges & suck to make it very easy when you are running so fast falling off possibly to your death. Another drawback is the main reason people don't use SOW on a plane raid, FEAR! Fear in a dungeon can be a very scray thing you have no idea where you will end up, also when you are running so fast there's no telling how far it will be.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OK just my two cents from a 38 Druid on E'ci (Xindar Aldarion)....<P>1) TP to surefall just makes sense. Honestly, I've never spent any time in Everfrost. Why? Because I've got to TP to NK, and run across seemingly the longest zone in EQ. It's slow, and I'll end up wastnig 30 mintues in travel time to head over there. Surefall is such a druid friendly place, only makes sense that we can port there.<P>2) There's all this talk about changing one spell or another, yet I consistently read about complaint about druids being solo-ers and Vernat wants to somehow balance that. Well here's my experience: I get in a group with a Cleric, Wizard, Warrior, and Shaman. OK, shaman's strength buffs are better than mine, Clerics AC buffs are better, Wizards DD is better, and nobody wants me to dot cause of aggro. So... basically I am there to Damage Shield the tank and act as a backup healer. Hence, NOBODY wants us. Oh sure, they'll ask for a SOW or a TP, but when it comes to brass tacks in grouping, I am pretty much not of use to most people. And people are surprised we solo so much????<P>3) SoW II<BR>Great idea... speed is everything in both kiting and travelling. If new rings are too difficult, seems an enhanced SOW would be the next best thing.<P>Just my two cents...<P>- Xindar Aldarion<BR>38th Wood Elf Druid<BR>Lords of Light<BR>E'ci Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ok as far as the Quad kiting part of this discussion.. Druids and Wizards can do this quite efectivly but realize thier is more downtime associated with this type of tactic.. <P>The reason for this is most of the cons we fight are blue to low blue to us.. and we usually end up using most if not all of our mana to take 3 to 4 of them out at a time.. but then we must med all that mana back.. so in the time it takes to med that back we really just had about allmost the same time as a regular person soloing.. Of course thier are exceptions.. if we are getting mana from someone else IE : Bard, manastone, necro, mod rods, this greatly reduces the time spent medding and then make it a better tactic..<P>I think it should be left alone.. this tactic is not as fast of an experience getting thing as ppl think.. it only shows signs of a greatly trained druid and a druid that knows how to use his classes abilities to thier greatest potential..<P>Just a few thought.. <P>Brahhm 46'th Druid of Tunare<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Druids:  Druids in EQ are Jacks of all trades, masters of None, making them versatile, but not enough to make them chosen if another class is available that can do a specific ability better.  Druids shouldn't par say have a class "specific" ability, in EQ...they are masters of none...a specific ability would make them a master of something, going against what makes us...us.  So if a druid isn't going to have a "specific" ability, how the heck am I going to propose something that will make them more wanted on raids?  Easy,... give us buffs that enhance other classes buffs, not much on their own, but on top of the specialized classes buff, would be a valued aid in a grp/raid setting; give us watered down versions of other classes lesser abilities, meaning, give us(for example)a clerics highest heal(don't recall the name..most clerics cast ch) aside from CH(CH is a cleric class specific ability, therefore, not being a master healer, we should not get it), but make it take longer and more mana to cast.  Do this with all classes...making it where the druid could fill another classes role in a pinch, but not take away that classes ability.  Before you all say "WTH, your saying give a druid all classes abilities?  Why don't we all just play druids then?" Put it into a scenario:<P>Your fighting a major mob(say Venril Sathir) and through out the ensuing fight, the cleric(s) are running lom, the shaman(s) are being hit and can't cast, the wizard(s)dead...etc, etc, this is where the druids would aid in the fight, being able to cast that Clerical Superior Heal...while taking longer to cast and more mana consumed, would still be a Superior heal that may make or break the fight, casting that massive wizard DD...while again taking more time/mana to cast, may be enough to finish the mob off.  I'm not saying give druids all the other classes "special" abilities, give us a few of each classes lesser abilities at a much higher time/mana cost.  Being a jack of all trades means being able to do some of alot of different specific occupations abilities, but not as fast or as effecient as one who specializes in that particular feild.  Enhancing a chanters c2 by a point or 2, the clerics HP buff by like 3-5 percent, the mage's damage shield by 3-5 points, things like this as far as buffs are concerned, while not doin anything spectacular by themselves, would make all other classes buffs all the better.

Would'nt be a complaint if I was another class, but seeing how I port many ppl every nite around Kunark, It is more work than fun for a busy druid.  Add a ring to LF, GF?  Nah, Steamfont is already very close to there, no need.<P>Succor/Egress:  Does'nt wipe agro every time...not a huge deal in my opinion as long as everyone knows that ahead of time.

Either have succor clear aggro, or remove the 700 mana drain from each player.  <P>ITEM: Wake of Karana (anti-rain spell)<P>DESCRIPTION:  Currently, the spell has too many limitations to be useful in a group/raid situation outdoors, and is rather steep in requirements for an effect that is in no way over-powering.  The spell costs 400 mana, requires an expensive opal (17-20 pp), and recast time is like 6 minutes.  In addition, the spell only removes rain, not snow which is frozen water.  This spell could be desirable in outdoor raids/groups to allow pullers to pull in clear weather for outdoor dragons, etc..  However, the spell has too steep of cost.  It needs to be fixed by: 1. have it remove snow as well as rain, 2. reduce the mana cost  3. make spell component slightly cheaper like peridot (and a component most people have around)  4. change recast time to something reasonable like 30 seconds so the spell can actually be cast when needed.<P>ITEM: Spirit of the Oak<P>DESCRIPTION:  This spell gives slight mana regen at 59, but the spell is not stackable with Protection of the Glades (60 spell).  Thus, the spell has use for only a single level and the spell already has many limitations - self only, outdoors only, and rooted.  Having it stack would not be imbalancing and actually give the spell more use.  Also, the spell ought to be moved to a slightly lower level - say 57 or 58.  Druids start getting some mana regen at 54 from Form of the Howler (outdoors only too), but have to wait for 59/60 for any more mana regen.  The effect of Spirit of the Oak is minor so why not allow its use at a slightly lower level to spread out the gain in regen.<P>ITEM: The 55th level pet.<P>DESCRIPTION: The pet is too weak for a 55th level spell.  For balance reasons, the pet is not meant to be able to tank, but the equivalent of a magician/necro 29th level pet spell is too low.  Other class novelty spells from velious (form of the bear, boon of the garou) look cool and give some "real" added bonus that benefits the player.  To fix the problem, raise the pet to the equivalent of a magician/necro 39th level pet spell.  This pet would still never be able to remotely tank anything that one fights at 55+, but the pet would have a better chance of dealing out some damage (not much, but just enough to have a little bit of use).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Quote: ITEM: New Druid Rings.<P>DESCRIPTION: New rings would require redoing whole zones to get graphics in for them. But some of these ideas might be feasible, especially if we consider a high concentration of trees enough of a nature focus for a druid to travel to. Perhaps giving druids access to rings in Surefall Glade, Greater Fay (both of which are druid starting cities, and G Fay already has a ring), Warslik Woods, or perhaps Lesser Fay would make travel easier for them. These locations make a lot of sense from a story integrity standpoint, the issue here is does it make sense from a gameplay viewpoint.<P>STATUS: None<P><BR>----<P>My reply to this. Alan, I haven't reverse-engineeered or decompiled any EQ code, but adding teleport destinations shouldn't be dependent upon a graphic or a prefab such a druid ring. The EQ engine is probably proprietary, but I'm sure there is a fair bit of Quake 2 inspiration in it. I also imagine that the level designers of EQ use a tool very similar to WorldCraft or QERadiant to make zones with. If this is so, then it is quite simple to add a info_teleport_destination entity to any given map. The entity needs to be tied to an origin, in this case the spells Ring of --- or Circle of ---.<BR>The graphical part of druid rings may be easy or hard depending on how the maps in EQ are compiled.<BR>If the maps are compiled .bsp trees a la Quake 2 or Half Life, then the map would need to be recompiled to add a druid ring graphic. If not, and they were simply text descriptions of prefabs, nodes, entities, etc, then I imagine only a diff would need to be run on the map to update them. If the druid ring is a prefab, i.e a pre-constructed brush, then it wouldn't be very big, say 30-40Kb in size.<BR>So, in this case, where is the technical difficulty in adding a new druid teleport destination?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What about the current standing or crumbling rings of South Karana and Rathe Mountains?  Spells were never implimented for either of these places.  The South Karana one is crumbling but then so is Sro's ring so that can't be used as an excuse.  As for Rathe Mountains one, that area is guarded by unkempt druids, so while it makes for a hot spot to gate to (central and good hunting) faction reasons give it a risk.  Actually I'd like to see the South Karana one used as a lower level evac.  Think of all the coin druids could make on tips for evacs there, like people that pay for evacs from KC to EJ.  People from Qeynos dont like the long run from Qeynos to SK so get an evac from Black Burrow.  And from Free Port get an evac from Unrest, Gfayers can get an Eevac from Crushbone to SK.  Good tip potential for porters for the convience of good hunting for those being ported.<P>Just my opinion</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Please address the limited usefulness of Druid buffs in a group.  If a group has a Cleric, and one is practically required for Kunark and definitely Velious, the main Druid buff (skin like nature series) is completely useless.  This line of spells is already balanced by very high cost (about three times the cost of comparable Cleric hp buffs) and less hp/ac increases than the Cleric or Shaman buffs that do stack with each other.  Currently Druids are perfectly balanced outdoors and at low levels, the main source of imbalance exists indoors and at high levels, where Druids are not wanted in groups because of their limited contributions.  Pretty much only snare, as damage output is much better handled by a wide range of classes, backup healing is handled better by Shamans who can slow and thus reduce the need for healing, and even then, snare is shared by six (Druid, Necro, Shadowknight, Ranger, Bard, Wizard) out of thirteen classes.  Druids should have their skin series buffs stack and recieve new, unique buffs in order to increase grouping desirability.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
