</FONT><HR>Thought it was interesting that Colla also got suspended/banned a few months ago, and obviously used to work for Verant and got fired? Sounds like a jerk to me - I am SURE the GM was aware the account had previous action against it. I have played for much longer than all of Colla's chars combined, and I have never even been threatened by a GM in any way - take this as a learning lesson - what comes around goes around.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

"I WAS BANNED FOR NO REASON!!"  Yeah, right.  Next time don't bite the hand that feeds you, it really doesn't work in the long run.<P>In this case I've got little sympathy, picking the thing up and taking off is about as cheesy as you can get.

There is a Jumdace on Rodcet but If I remember right that's a shaman who would PROBABLY not be buying a Wurmslayer.  <P>Further more, if this guy had been playing so long, and even used to work for Verant, Then he HAD to have known the fact that the Wrumslayer Trade scam had been VERY abused, and many GM's were working off a very short fuse on this issue.  It was such a widely used abuse in fact that, I believe, they chucked RP issues over the sword and made it fit in a bag simply because of this problem.  If he knew all that, as a long standing player, and former VI employee, Why did he take it and run?

</FONT><HR>&gt; and many GM's were working off a very short fuse<BR>&gt; on this issue.<P>Excuse me?! That's the problem we are screaming about right there.  GMs are an employee dealing with a customer base as a company's representative.  They aren't allowed to have short fuses with customers. They are to remain polite and curteous at all times.<P>Well, at least in the real world that's how it works. Obviously Verant doesn't believe in such nor instruct their employees to leave their bad days away from the customers.<P>I don't care how upset they are at something. It's not my problem, nor do I want to hear about it.  When I can't provide something for my customers that I said I would, they don't want excuses. When I get off the phone being upset with a distributor, they don't want my anger directed at them.  When I'm upset at the punk that just tried to steal from me, the next person in line doesn't want to hear about my problems.<P>I'm there to serve each one as individuals and at 100% politeness.  It's not wrong for us to be demanding that from Verant, we do after all have a business arrangement with them, be it if we pay 25 cents of 10$ or 100$. It's not my problem, they've set the price point, because it's only 10$ doesn't mean they get to be rude, abrupt or have a bad day in my face.<P>The customer was a jerk. That doesn't give the right for the employee to come off as "you threatening me?" <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>What cracks me up is you all seem to miss the point.<P>Now, wether this story is fake or real... most of you are arguing semantics about "threats" etc, that don't really have any bearing.<P>Fact (per the story): GM, for whatever reason, SUSPENDS the player (and had every right to do so, IMO... he even mentioned he had the right to do so because of this "trade scam", ... and don't tell me that the person had already given back the money, that doesn't alleviate the offense or the intent of the action... or the penalty.).<P>Now, what got the person BANNED were the subsequent emails, which have not been offered up for evidence, and no one would in all likelihood beleive anyway.<P>So, succinctly, there is nothing to argue about.  The GM acted within policy, and -- and based on the support in this thread, even when people are thinking the GM BANNED him -- well within the paramaters expected by the majority of the playerbase.<P>'Nuff said, let this thread die.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I believe Becky to having been sarcastic in that post... <P>&gt; It seems that you guys HATE rules and want to<BR>&gt; get away with murder... <P>I'm all for rules, and enforcement of the posted rules, as long as it consistantly enforced across the board and not at the whim of the current enforcer.<P>&gt; WE DON'T pay for silver service or politeness.<BR>&gt; SURE if a Hotel treated us like that you<BR>&gt; can do something, becuase we expect some decorum <BR>&gt; from their staff.<P>Excuse me?!

Well, okay I suppose they can decide to not provide decorum and pay the price of going out of business.<P>&gt; But VI take our money to pay staff to develop<BR>&gt; Add-Ons, maintain the Servers, patch, Nerf, GMs <BR>&gt; to help and maintain order.<P>And while they are doing such they can be polite back to their paying customers. They have the job after all thanks to us, but you'd never know it at Verant. They'd rather be adversial to their entire customer base.<P>I sincerely hope that anybody that considers that line from the poster that got the "is that a threat" response, doesn't work in CS. It's going to be a long stressful life if you do. You're going to many times have someone demand to speak to your supervisor in your career. It's not a threat. <P>Being suspended banned for breaking rules is awesome. I'm all for it - after of course they state the rules you broke. Being adversarial back to your customers, I'm totally against, no matter what the customer has done.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It seems that everyone thinks someone has to be rude to enforce a rule.  The GM CAN you know, kick someone out of the game without being rude, insulting, condescending. It's quite possible and has the same result, the player gone.<P>                 <BR>&gt; You also say ALL businesses have to be polite.. <BR>&gt; correct me if I'm worng but is a NITECLUB a<BR>&gt; business? <BR>&gt; And if you get caught doing something rong.. do <BR>&gt; not the BOUNCERS kick the crap out of you and <BR>&gt; leave you lying outside in the rain?<BR>                    <BR>I don't live in the USA. We aren't a society based on suing. However, we just had such a case. Two bouncers charged with assault, and found guilty when they kneed and tripped someone, then threw them out the door. It was done because the customer didn't jump when the bouncers said jump. Needless to say the law prevailed, the bouncers got sentenced, and the bar is pretty much out of business with people not wanting to go there.<P>Again, you want the customer gone, you grab them by the arm, after you've explained the rules, what they did wrong, and have asked them to politely leave. Then 2 bouncers escort the customer out of the bar, laying no more than hands to direct the customer out of the bar. You do more, you will pay the price.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

We're against rude, abusive, paranoid, power-trippin GMs. We've never said that the customer shouldn't have been banned. We've stated that the actions of the GM were wrong and need to be corrected by Verant. We don't believe nor support that one needs to be rude when someone is rude. That punishment can be delivered without being rude. That rudeness in punishment is just as bad as being rude in the crime.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm from England.... and our bouncers get away with brawling every nite.<P>They know the crack head they smack ain't gonna complain. Occasionally something like what you described happens.<P>You say the LAW prevailed.. heh heh... personally I like to see a crack head go a few rounds.. it's nice.. that's my idea of justice.<P>Of course Power-tripping 'bully' bouncers and cops are abusing.. and I UNDERSTAND when you say that you don't want a 'bully' GM..<P>Niether do I.<P>In 2 years of playing I have never met an Arrogant GM, they have ALWAYS been helpful and I have never been on the wrong side of them.<P>Something I DON'T understand is why many you out there are complainnig about GMs being 'Vigilantes' and arsey towards you... <P>I only draw one conclusion.. the only one that I can FROM experience... <P>The people that I hear complaining about GMs have usually always done something wrong.. OR it's a complaint about response time... the GM comes along to help them.. and the first thing out of there mouth is sarcastic comment about having to wait 3 hours for a response... well the GMs had a lot to deal with in those 3 hours... he doesn''t deserver a mouthful from some upstart who thinks that he is more important than the previous petionee.<P>I HATE that we must wait.. but once a GM turns up we should be thankful that he IS here to save our character and get our Flowing Black Sash back out of the Lava.<P>Tell me now then - Because I NEED to know if I'm to understand your mind - tell me now then, what a GM did to you that was disrespectful? And then tell me why he had come to you in the first place i.e. why had you petitioned or been summoned?<P>I do not see the GM being anything but DECENT in Collas post.. I'm sorry but we must be reading different things. The GM is NOT condesending.. until Colla is.. Colla starts it.. <BR>He made the decision.<P>Now I know that if someone breaks into your house, buggers your dawg, shoots your fish, steals your telly and you Smack him in the face... the law will punish you for GBH. And you will have to pay HIM for damages.<P>I'm of a skool where the guy not only gets a broken nose from you.. but the cops kick in nads and he has to pay you quadruple your costs...<P>He made the decision.<P>I hate that I must be polite to him.. and be careful not to unload a Ball Bearing into his eye!<P>I hate that.<P>Again I realise that the prey could be the predator and mistakes can be made in Justice. INNOCENT ppl can be punished... but in this artificial EQ... we have logs and stuff... so really, there can be no missing evidence.<P>Please tell me why you all have it in for GMs, please tell me... because I have had nothing but GOOD experience with them.<P>Kudos  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Doucha, you are making quite a lot of assumptions there.<P>Just because I disagree that GM's or any other customer service people at Verant can make decisions to ban people because they are offended by their behavior towards them, doesn't mean I agree with the "offender's" behavior.<P>I am a nice person.. I am not rude or loud-mouthed.  I don't feel like, as an American, I am entitled to everything I want and that I can be as rude as I want and still get it.<P>I feel if you go into a store and plunk down $40 of your hard earned money and then pay $10 a month, you have the right to helpful courteous PATIENT customer service.<P>If this Colla person had been shouting obsenities or calling this GM names or had been harassing other players, I would feel differently about the situation.  As I can see, the only 'rule' he allegedly broke was 'threatening a GM'... I really don't see the threats.  He was complaining and making snide comments and insinuating that the new Verant employees were no good.. but I hardly feel that is SO threatening that it deserves you to be banned.  With a banning, you lose the right to ever use those CD keys again.. you lost your $40 worth of software... its not just the service.<P>Straith.. I was not being sarcastic.. I really do agree with what you are saying.  You say it way better than I have been able to.<P>The other day I was starting to see your point Doucha... but your brainwashing techniques have worn off and I am starting to regain my senses!!<P>BeckyDruid</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ahh BEX my sweet...<P>----<BR>If this Colla person had been shouting obsenities or calling this GM names or had been harassing other players, I would feel differently about the situation. <BR>----<P>Get ready to feel different then and I quote again "or had been harassing other players", had he not harrassed Jumlace?<P>Your definition of harrassment, you're probably thinking of consstant tells or verbal abuse - he scammed him.. that's harassment.<P>I know you agree on that.<P>Therefore you have made a flaw in your statement.<P>I know that you want a PATIENT customer service... BUT I DON'T SEE the GM being impatient.. I see him reacting to Colla's goaeding.<P>WE see differnt things.. I don't want to 'brainwash' you.. I want to 'educate' you... you can see already that you are in the minority by reading all the other ppls's posts.<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Perhaps if you also ate sweet Popcorn you would use the glucose content to produce energy for your brain to actually realise that the GM did nothing wrong... said nothing wrong.

</FONT><HR>&gt; The GM is NOT condesending.. until Colla is..<P>Bingo! Exactly. The GM became condescending once the customer was. That's wrong.<P>Why am I so upset?  I've actually never spoken to a GM. I've petitioned 3 times in my life, all for technical glitches and never had a one answered.<BR>But I've seen GMs mouth off. Be it during an event, or while someone else was being ragged out. But most often it's in chat, when I enter the chat room and the very first thing I see is:<BR>"Don't mess with me today, I'm not in the mood, I'll ban you if you push me".  I saw that on Friday night. I've seen stuff like that over and over. And I personally don't like it.<P>Becky, oops sorry, I misread based on your earlier comments, my apologies  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
