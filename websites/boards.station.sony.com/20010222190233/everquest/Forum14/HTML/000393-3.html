</FONT><HR>This was supposed to be a summary of what the Druids need to "balance" our class and this list would be presented to the EQ Live Team for consideration.<P>The first draft was pretty much intact as 90% of the requests were for grouping abilities post 50 as pre-50, while not perfect, was good enough. The only Pre-50 change that was asked for was to address healing of which moving Superior Heal to 44 or 49 was on the first draft.<P>What the heck happened to the first draft? This draft dropped almost everything and added lots of useless fluff that few, if anyone asked for.<P>This makes me wonder if they really wanted our opinion or were just going through the motions and saying they asked us.<P>Here is the last "Draft" From Jan 18th.<P>First I want to ask you all to keep within the generally existing mechanics. We’re looking for balance, but I’m not going to bring a dozen new spell ideas to the team as a balance tool… And, realistically, we have to keep the ideas to things that won’t require a team of artists and programmers to create. <P>Here’s what I’ve gleaned so far, filtered through my own ideas. <P>Healing: <P>Druids (and Shaman) want to be better at healing. Not only would this give them a more active roll at the end of the big raids, while at the same time reducing perceived ‘need’ for clerics at such times. But we also have to keep in mind that healing is the clerics role, and we do not want to infringe on that role. <P>So the proposal is this: <P>Move Superior Healing to 49th level. <P>Add a new healing spell at 55th level. My suggestion so far is Remedy - a fast casting, low healing spell, and a solid upgrade from Superior Healing that won’t really infringe on the clerics power, which lies in big healing spells. <P>Maybe add another healing spell at 60th level - perhaps Divine Light (though I’d rename it…) <P>Reduce the fizzle rate on druid healing spells at the 50+ level. <P>More Quests: There have been repeated requests for more mid-level quests for druids. Though this isn’t really a class balance thing, I’ll keep it on this list. <BR>Charm Animals: For a long time I’ve liked the idea of a druid being able to charm pets without making them angry. But this also has a ton of gameplay issues attached to it. Keep in mind that the main drawback to charm is that aggro factor. Taking it out would require some other serious drawbacks… But I’ve also got that on my list. It should make for some interesting discussions.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> The idea of making them act like enchanter pets would certainly help. ” How about a High level charm animal spell that only works on animals that con kindly or amiable. If the spell works, it says "The wooly mammoth decides to join you", if it fails it says "The wooly mammoth declines your offer".” Right, something like that…  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>New Druid Rings: I’m not likely to advocate placing new rings, those require redoing whole zones to get graphics in for them. But some of these ideas might be feasible (I’m not saying that they are good ideas, just feasible…): <P>If we assume that trees themselves can work as foci for druid travel magics: <P>Surefall Glade<BR>Warslik Woods<BR>Greater Fay OR Lesser Fay <P>Form of the mouse! (I’m only slightly kidding, I like the idea). <P>[Quote from original post: Simple: Damage shield damage gets credited to the caster if more than 8 levels above the one being casted upon- same with mages.”]<P>Actually, I’ve always wondered why this damage wasn’t always credited to the caster… I’ll ask. <P>[Quote from original post: Any chance of treant form?]<P>Hmmm… just a higher level version of tree form, that would come after wolf form, that is mobile… Interesting. <P>Other new forms aren’t gonna fly (heh, good pun). As I’ve said before, I’d much rather advocate the use of any free space for giving enchanters more forms. <P>As for Spirit of Wolf - part II the revenge of the doggie: I’ll suggest it, but I don’t anticipate it happening, and I’m not one that would vote for it. <P>Soloing: And, as a note, I’m not inclined to suggest improvements to the druids ability to solo. Keep in mind that we are encouraging grouping… <P>New looks: this isn’t a balance issue. But I’ll bring it up. I wouldn’t expect any new armor looks to come out as a result. Those kinds of things take a lot of resources to make. <P>Class specific armor is too heavy (Vermiculated): This is also something I can ask about. Heavier than warrior armor? <P>Elder Spiritist Boots: no component should be needed. <P>Faydedar: I’m pretty sure someone is looking into this beasty and his lifestyle. I’ll follow up on it. <P>Quad Kiting: My personal opinion is that the ability to do this should probably be reduced. I will probably suggest changes that have that effect. Though the only one I’ve seen (that wouldn’t also affect the rest of the gameplay for the class) that might work is to reduce the range on AoE spells… <P>NO LURES! Not gonna happen, I tells ya. <P>No resurrections either. I don’t see a need for it at all. <P>I admit that after about seven pages I started scanning instead of reading. But most of what I was seeing were repeats of the same requests. I consider that a good sign, really. But if I missed something that you don’t see above, let me know.<P><BR>I can see three main things asked for:<P>1. Superior Healing from 53 to 49 and reduce the fizz rate.<P>2. A few new port locations to open up the world.<P>3. More Quests as we get the least amount for all the classes.<P>The rest were bug fixes or error corrections (Armor too heavy, spells needed too expensive components ect..)<P>The MAIN request and some, myself included, think only real request was to move Superior Heal to 44 or 49. As of 2 weeks ago it was going to be moved to 49 and now it's back up to 51.<P>All I ask is for an explanation of why Verant cannot move it to 44 or 49 and insists on Druids in their 40's suffering with weak haling abilities and nothing to do on raids until they turn 51? All that other stuff was not on the list as of Jan 18th.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You know... after re-reading the final draft I may have been a bit too hard in my posts. I guess I was upset that the main request was to move Superior Heal to 49 or 44 and it was changed to 51 with no explanation. The list, as a whole, is a good one. A number of great ideas for grouping skills was totally left off the list and grouping abilities is what we need. Sure I like the other stuff but it does not address the main problem of the Druid Class.<P>I know now what Superior Healing was not dropped to 44 or 49 as requested. If you re-read the last draft you will see that it asked for Superior Healing to be moved to 49 and a new healing spell at 55.<P>Now read the final draft... see what's missing? If you guessed to "new" 55 healing spell you would win a cookie!<P>Yes! the clerics "whining" about us getting new healing abilities just knocked us out again! Superior Healing will not be moved to 44 or 49 as they do not want to give us any new healing abilites at 55 or 60.<P>I did not see any druids crossposting over on Cleric Talk about clerics being the only real healers but MANY of them whined and complained and knocked us out again.<P>Moving Superior Heal from 53 to 51 is a slap in the face!<P>Now: Greater Heal 29 - Superior Heal 53 = 24 level gap<P>Proposed: Greater Heal 29 - Superior Hear 51 = 22 level gap<P>Does anyone else fine this a joke?<P>How does this give us better healing????? It helps those level 50 and 51 and that is it!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Kunark is a year old, could you be kind to our feet for once and change the emerald jungle/skyfire gates into NORMAL gates? Right now it just makes more work for druids and wizards gathering people for raids and honestly, we have enough work to do being the guild chauffeur without making extra work.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Even by casting str on myself, I am usually either 1 or 2 points over or a few points down, depening on what I am holding.<P>What I'd really like to see is a triggered spawn for Faydadar, the dragon in Tim Deep.  Why can't it by like any other tainted or corrupted?  Kill a tainted "creature" and have it be spawned.  It would be much apprecitiable.  I am not saying make it, easy, just make it a "triggered" spawn, yet keep it hard /shrug.  Sitting in Tim for hours/days/weeks/months is really boring.  And when it does spawn, say 4:13am PST.

</FONT><HR>Hello All,<BR>I have read the many posts here and I find them intriguing grnated I am only a Level 14 druid this is my first character.  What I have seen missing form all of these posts is the fact that we are paying customers and that Verant seems to be didctating what they will and will not do to enhance OUR product. I would like to say i am disappointed due to the fact that chose a druid becuase of the mystique that druids have and the UNIQUE abilities true fantasy lore speaks of druids.  I have seen in the game and elsewhere that druids are not well thought of?  Anyway I think that some Lower level spells should be implemented ro the druid class 2 or 3 Unique spells shouldn't hurt anyones feelings like SOW 2 or Spirit of Cheetah etc.  Thought I would put in my 2 coppers worth if it means anything.<BR>                          Thanks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ABSOR PLEASE READ THIS:<P> I have a fresh idea that would make druids as welcome in 50+ dungeons and raids as clerics, without adding to our healing powers.<P> Druids have long been about natural things. And Against Summoned things. Mobs that are 52+ Summon which is an annoying thing that I believe was designed to stop soloing. (You can't kite somthing that summons you back to it). We know the summoning ability is based on unnatural summoning magic, i.e. the Magicians call of the hero spell. Giving druids a "Resist Summoning" line of spells would give us a unique and defined purpose in the 50+ game, without overbalancing the group we are in (lets face it, any group(s) fighting a mob high enough to summon are going to either win or loose reguardless of being summoned. Only thing this would help with would be the emergency get away, and helping a cleric to camp out in times of panic.) Thank you for your time. I truely hope you at least lay this idea down on the table.<P>          -Endorn Darkpaw<BR>             52 druid of terris thule<BR>             Equites Nobilis<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Healing: Good job on test  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Charm Animals: Nice idea... Non-agro pet breaks, if your gonna limit the commands we can give to our pet give us /pet as you were as a sort of way to break charm while leaving them amiable and unharmed.<P>New Druid Rings: Greater Faydark already has a druid ring right on the Kelethin newbie grounds. LFay has a druid ring right next to Mistmoore. Ocean of Tears also has a ring on the island with Gornit and Seafuries.<P>SOW2: Bout time! SOW is very slow when you compare it to Kunark/Velious stuff. <P>Appearances: Why not use textures you already have in the game.<P>Quad Kiting: Risk vs Reward, keep it real Absor. We have many more risks kiting 4 blues than a group of 6 have killing something thats red con to all them. We could go OOM, could get resists on snares, could take longer than 10 minutes and have things break free and start after us, could slip up on the timing and have 4 things double attacking for 90's, ect... The risk is greater for a wizard obviously but still.<P>Ro's Firey Sundering: Make it drop off wurms! Only place I hear it drops from is Garou in Iceclad and its rare. This is likely a drop table issue.<P>Group Treeform: How about making this a 44 spell maybe a few extra hp/tick that stacks with everything. I dont see the point in not having it as ROOT nolonger overwrites SOW.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'd like to suggest these items as possible alterations to the list. <P>ITEM: Movement Speed( i.e. sow, cheetah, etc)<P>DESCRIPTION: Spirit of Cheetah post fix/change was a semi-useable traveling spell, which while not overly convenient for it's very short duration, did help traveling about in the Old World. Spirit of Scale, and Scale of Wolf were added to fill this void I guess, but the increases are so negligible over sow that the drawbacks to using them are not even worth it. Perhaps making Spirit of Scale and Scale of Wolf at least close to Spirit of Cheetah would make them more useful as travel spells, which will help everyone as a whole. Sow 2 would not be needed in this situation, as it will more then likely cause all sorts of balance issues with current mobs' speed.<P>** While I realize that there is a concern that by increasing the speed at which players travel will make the world smaller, so to speak, I have read many posts about the ridiculous amount of time required in getting from one place to another JUST to get somewhere to look for a group.  Using a spell like a modified Scale of Wolf (mentioned above), players could have a spell that enables them to enjoy the game more by reducing the tedium of a very long journey from one dungeon to another. The limitations of this only being a travel spell are already included in the spells conditions.<P>---<P>ITEM: Healing<P>DESCRIPTION: Superior Healing being moved to level 51 is good move, from what I gather, this is when clerics get their new heal spell, so we won't be competing with them healing wise. I do see a problem with having higher level heals however because clerics start to get their Celestial Healing and Celestial Elixir (regen/heals  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/confused.gif"> ) spells, which I think should have been druid/shaman high level heal(s) where we can't heal as quickly or as much as a cleric, but we heal a decent amount over time. I don't know why clerics ever got an uber-regen type heal spell, but maybe that is where the primary (clerics)/secondary (druid/shaman) healer line got blurred in the primary's favor.  The primary healers received a spell line that would have been great for secondary healers, assuming they did less healing and were less efficient then the current spells of course.  This would go a lot farther than just moving Sup Healing up 2 levels.  <P>**As a side note to this, since clerics will complain were they to lose this series, why do they ALSO complain about druid/shamans getting higher level healing spells?  Everquest was made with classes that would work together and compliment one another. Clerics having a monopoly on all decent healing spells, forces the class balance in their favor, thus unbalancing the classes. They will always have more/better/more efficient heals then druids and shamans, on top of which, a cleric would have the option of spending less time sitting and medding and take a more active role in the fighting if they ask the druid or shaman to take or share SOME of their workload.  I stress SOME because a druid or shaman will never come close to replacing a cleric in a group.<P>---<P>ITEM: New Druid Gates<P>DESCRIPTION:  Gates in Surefall Glade and Warslik Woods would be very helpful, even implemented with gate keys like Velious.  Rathe Mountains also be an interesting addition considering the unkempt druids residing there and their reaction. Lfay would be silly because of the 2 gates we already have to a continent with 5 main outdoor areas.<P>Thanks for reading and hearing what I have to say. =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Uh, AnakinJay, "summoning a player" (as in, to whisk a player from its current location to one's feet, ala 'Call of the Hero') is not the same as an unnatural, ala "summoned" creature.  Not even close.<P>One's a Conjuration, a single spell that pulls somebody from there to here.  The reverse of a Wizard's port and a Druid's ring, if you will.<P>The other is an unnatural, magical force.  Being completely and totally alien to the natural balance of nature (ie, a "summoned creature" in terms of what can be affected by 'ward summoned' is a creature not of Tunare - a construct of magic or unholy force) and thus, afflicted by 'ward summoned' because of its disruption of the natural balance of Life.<P>You want an ability to resist summoning?  I grant that is a fine power, and one that at least one class ought to have, whether resist-based or immunity-based.  I also like the idea of Druids doing it.  'Bond of the Land' would be my perception of this spell.  You cast this on a group-mate (not just anyone) and they receive the Bond, providing them a resist to any attempt to summon them while under its affect.  The power of the resist would be equal to that of their magic resistance at the time of the check, so high magic resist will help this spell, but the tashan line can hinder it.  Etc.<P>This includes Gate, Portal/Circle, Creature 'Summoning', and Evacs.  You resist these as if they were all an offensive spell, even if you cast them yourself (ever tried to 'fear' yourself?) and they are only successful given a failed resist check.  Which means that your 'Bond of the Land' can prevent you from gating, or cause you to be left behind in an Evac.<P>An upgrade to the spell might be 'Pact of the Land' that provides IMMUNITY to summoning, but also immunity to the aforementioned gate, portal/circle, creature 'summoning' and evacs.<P>Just because you can be left behind in an evac or port, or have to resist your own gate spell, doesn't make it useless.  It will have its uses.  Divine Aura (Harmshield, etc.) prevent all spells, beneficial and otherwise, from affecting the recipient including ports and evacs, so why not this?<P>I've read a LOT about Druid healing, healing rate vs. speed of casting, fizzle rate on high level spells, etc... and all in all, I'm overwhelmed.  There are so many conflicting voices on this from so many different people that without personal experience in playing a Druid at high levels, I have no idea where the Druid is coming from.<P>Nonetheless: I've recently grouped as an enchanter with a shaman, druid, paladin, magician, and necromancer.  We pulled single targets in an open area and would debuff them, send in pets to hit them a bit, and sometimes snare/darkness and fear them.  Rarely was my ability to crowd control even used.  Choke was useless, as it was overwritten by necromancy.  One of my debuffs was useless as the shaman did it regularly, the other was overwritten by the shaman.  I performed a tashan, a single debuff... and looked for opportunities to get my pet to join the fray.<P>Not exactly my cup of tea, but I didn't brew it and I wasn't going to go looking for a mug of joe instead.<P>The Druid was our primary healer, with the shaman his backup.  That Druid could barely keep up with the damage our Paladin received from a mob completely debuffed by my and the shaman's spells, even with two pets hitting it at once (their bash is SUPPOSED to stun it a little, right?) and mine thrown in for good measure when possible.  Generally, the Druid was able to get a DoT off right after my tashan and either melee or meditate as needed until he had to start healing, and then that was all he did.  If we feared the mobs, we won easily.  If we couldn't...<BR>well, if we couldn't fear them (too high) then we did a LOT of letting one guy build aggro and run the mob in circles so the pets and Paladin could hit it.  Otherwise, the Druid would OOM and just not get enough to heal without pulling the Shaman into the equation too.<P>Other than nuking like a wizard, giving us all SoW (which is tactically a wonderful thing, but only when it's needed) and skin buffs, and thorns when the fight started, the druid was kinda bored.  A few times we complained that he would melee when he should have been meditating, as he didn't have enough mana to heal in the first place.<P>If I could have asked for one more ability for that Druid to have instead of his single-cast healing spells to enhance the fight, it would have been a form of fast regeneration.  Ideally, the spell would be a 20 second healing spell.  You tag someone with it and in 20 seconds, they've "grown back" quite a bit of health.  During that time, their combat stats and AC also 'grow' proportionate to the amount of time the buff is on the person.  When their health maxes out or the duration expires, the spell ends - but until then, this is a regen that would stack with "regeneration" (it's primarily a healing spell, after all) that would both allow the druid to cast it once on a target and then continue using standard heals to supplement in an emergency, or tag one person with this and jump back up to melee again.<P>It seems like this could be something that would be added to make the Druid more group friendly.  It seems like this wouldn't interfere with Clerics, if stacking were not an issue.  Of course, two Druids in a group couldn't stack this spell on top of the same person twice to heal them at a doubled rate, but that's its limitation - it's healing over time.<P>Just a few minor thoughts.  Here I'm wishing I knew more about Druids and had less bad experiences with "dr00ds", as I've got this huge bias sitting here keeping me from WANTING to care much about 'em.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am a wizard but would be interested in what other casters think about this post to the wizard board.<P>TO THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM VIA ABSOR<P>ITEM: mana regeneration <P>THIS is a REQUIRED for all casters NOW to begin the balance of the caster versus melee imbalance that exists. This is needed for all levels as the trickle down of better gear pre-kunark to melee class has skewed the basic caster melee equation into the low thirties. The trickle down of gear from velious is just beginning and its effects will further skew this imbalance to even lower levels and make the midlevels worse than they are now.<P>A token fix here will produce no good results. You guys study this in combination with efficiency and resists to ALL casters. This is not an option but a necessity in the entire life of the caster.<P>ITEM: Spell efficiency<P>SEE ABOVE AND IS REQUIRED FOR ALL CASTER CLASSES FROM ONE TO SIXTY FOR THE SAME REASONS. Forget about the damage of mages, druids, and necros compared to wizards. FIX the caster imbalance first then work on the individual class differences in your vision of them. DO NOT<BR>fix class imbalance before you fix the basic caster=melee imbalance. <P>The scientific method (and its clear you are not using this) requires that the basic sides of an equation must be equal first, then changes to one side of that equation must be met by an opposite but equal change on the other side of the equation.<P>YOU have a basic desing flaw now because of a lack of understanding of the basic equation for the game. YOU FIXED ONE SIDE OF THE EQUATION SINCE BEFORE KUNARK WAS BEING DESIGNED AND NEVER TOUCHED THE CASTER SIDE. KUNARK AND POST 50 PLAY INCREASED THAT GAP. STILL FURTHER ENHANCEMENT OF THE MELEE SIDE OF THE EQUATION AND INEFFECTIVE CASTER FIXES(NON RECOGNITION OF THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM OF THE ORIGINAL FLAW STILL WORKING ITS WAY DOWN) PUSHED THE ENVELOPE FURTHER AS VELIOUS WAS RELEASED. <P>SURELY YOU REALIZE NOW THAT ALTHOUGH THE CASTER FIXES WERE NICE, THEY WERE WAY BEHIND THE MELEE CURVE FOR BALANCE.<P>VEILIOUS AND ITS INEVITABLE TRICKLE DOWN WILL ONLY MAKE IT WORSE.<P>BALANCE THE BASIC EQUATION IF YOU CAN,THEN WORRY ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL CLASSES. THESE ARE TWO SEPARATE ISSUES AND YOU MUST BALANCE THE BASIC EQUATION BEFORE ATTEMPTING THE CLASS BALANCE.<P>ITEM: Percentage damage spells<P>Same as above.<P>ITEM: Level cap on spells<P>Put same level cap on melee where they simple cannot damage a mob at all or remove it from the caster side of the equqation.<P>ITEM: Alkabor<P>This has nothing to do with balance, forget about it. They suck and you cant fix em. The game is not geared to ae play on any scale with overcrowded servers. It makes no sense to crowd an already crowded game.<P>ITEM: Flaming Sword<P>Leave it alone and we can let it go to last page of never used spells where it is now. NOT an issue for balancing the basic Melee Caster equation. Mages and Necros have their pet=better sword and thats just fine with me and prolly most wizards.<P>I mean, what the hell is the point of the thing??/<P>ITEM:Harvest<P>A WIZARD specific item that needs improvement but needs to be considered in with the basic caster melee equation and issuse in the first two items.<P>ITEM: RAIN spells<P>AGAIN refer to first two items. FIXING a specific damage spell needs to be considered within the basic melee caster equation first.<P>ITEM: Atol's <P>WHAT is the fizzle thing post 50 in a caster class that is way behind already. Fizzles got worse post kunark. ELIMINATE fizzles post 50. What is the point. Give a resonable explaination of this??????? What is the logic here for balance and fun.<P>LOOK AT FIZZLES ALONG WITH RESISTS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FIRST TWO ITEMS OF THIS POST AND FOR GOODNESS SAKE, GET REAL.<P>ITEM:Snare/enstill<P>Most wizards never use em work on item one and two above first priority. To heck with em, none of this line is usefull to a wizard now. Fix them later, fix balance first.<P>ITEM: invis vs undead<P>A comment like " I dont know why wizards get this in the first place" is not reguarded as an answer unless followed by because ........<P>I don't know why a paladin, enchanter, etc etc get it either.<P>ITEM:TELEPORT<P>Not the basic problem fix in later<P>ITEM: fade, shadowstep, and yonder<P>DOH<P>ITEM:Evacs, Abscond etc<P>Secondary problem should have been fixed at implementation if they were tested at all by the test team.

</FONT><HR>WOLF FORM FOR ENCHANTERS (Druid defining ability)<P>Lute of the Howler is not my primary concern, it's<BR>more of an example. I don't think that there should be items that grant out of class abilities, unless they are there for a specific reason. It may very well be that the Lute is just such an item. But I also don't like Invis on a warrior item, healing on mage items, direct damage on cleric items, summoning on bard items...<P>The Lute strikes a cord with me because the<BR>Werewolf form is probably THE signature form for<BR>enchanter, and giving it away seems wrong. Now<BR>I've heard there is an in-game story behind this<BR>that would favor its inclusion, and that's great. But that doesn't change my objection to the principle of giving powers from outside of the class, and especially signature powers, via items.<P>Well said and I agree completely!  We as druids, have very few signature items.  Wolfform is pretty much the ony one!  Why do Enchanters get a wolf form, and whats more, SoW is on the list for improvements.  I know the lists aren't final at all, but I feel that if they made the list that means that it's got a bit more than a 45% chance of making it.  Many good ideas never made these lists, so I'm guessing 45%.  I realize you are talking items, but the same logic can be applied to the druid's wolfform.<P>Thanks,<BR>Baralo Horehound</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Excellent ideas Hammer!<P>I would really welcome a raltime chat session between Druids and Verant or at the very least some open dialog. I think the magority of us are reasonable people and we understand that there are gameplay constraints to doing everything we ask but is it too much to ask for a simple explanation?<P>It is clear that Verant does not want to give us extensive grouping abilities as well as solo abilities as then everyone would want to play a druid and it would be overpowering.<P>It is also clear that at high levels a Druid solo's less and groups (or wants to LOL) more.<P>It also seems that our solo abilites stem from two spells combined with port abilities and that is snare and sow. We are the only class that gets all three. Port allows us to travel quickly to get to almost any area instantly and snare and sow allow us to kite - well outdoors at least.<P>I guess I can understand from the point of view of balance that it would be unfair to allow us to do everything yet something MUST be done to allow us to group in these large multi-group raids that define the "end-game" so-to-speak.<P>After thinking about this for a long time I think the fair and reasonable way to fix this without creating ANY play balance issue is to simple move Superior Heal to at least 49 for both us and Shamen and make Skin Like Nature to stack with other Hit Point Buffs particularly the clerics line...<P>or<P>Give us a SLN buff similar (maybe without the regen) and make it use a reagent like the cleric spells.This way it can stack but cost too much to be used on an everyday basis but can be used on the "big" raids.<P>The 10p or so reagent would keep us from dishing it out like water and keep us from stacking it with the old SLN spell unless a big raid warrented the expense.<P>Does this sound resonable?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Interesting post.  But my question remains.  What establishes the Druid as a Priest Class?  We should in my estimation, have some skill when its all said and done that establishes us as such.  Please don't tell me its the healing.  As a 39th season Druid, I can only heal Wizzards, Magicians, Enchanters, Necros..ie, those with low hit points, effectively.  Thus, Warriors, particulary Ogres, Trolls and Barbarians need Clerics.  You labled us healers, and we should be able to heal.  Superior Healing at 51 is a joke and does not allow us to heal characters with higher hitpoints satisfactorily in the meanwhile.  I believe most of us are requesting Superior Healing at level 39 or 44, and something to follow at a later level.  Personally, I don't see why we can't continue to receive upgrades in heals at the same pattern of 1 level behind Clerics, because at later levels Clerics are sought more for summoning you back to your corpse than anything else.  Druids aren't asking for the summon line, just healing...and it wouldn't matter if you continue it at a lesser strength until we get "Complete Heal" at a much later level (like 55-58).  Just make us what you said we are.  <P>Because of the problems with the healing, Druids are confused more than any other class when it comes to specialization.  Its a double edge sword.  We are confused into thinking we are healers, only to find at level 31 you're neither a healer nor a blaster (and certainly not melee).  Most choose evocation and change it later.<P>In addition, I would like to see us get some attribute that sets us apart in the Priest Class.  How about at some level we get a damage shield that works along the same order as "Lay On Hands"?  If someone touches who we targeted with this shield it drains some ratio of their health and we can't recast until 24hrs game time.  Most, if not all, melee and casters have a major damage dealing characteristic and Druids don't.<P>I would also like to see Druid's get more party/group buffs and at a reasonable level.  <P>I used to hate the charm line of spells for all the reasons mentioned in everybodys post.  But it makes sense to me that if we are hunting and I charm an animal (cougars for example) that is trying to maul me, that he would want to tear me apart after.  I was charmed by a Gnoll and blasted the daylights out of him when it was over...hehe  <P>Please note that it is not my intention to compare the Druid to any other character and references are not intended to be such.  I play a Druid and can only speak for what I feel would make us better, just as I feel that a non-Druid has no idea.<P>Thanks for listen   ???<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello All.<P>Like many of you, I've been an EQ'er since it came out. Though like the few of us I am mainly a weekend warrior. Occasionally getting some time in during the week.<P>Started out with a Monk. But quickly got tired of melee and was itching to cast. I chose a Druid because of the 'jack of all trades' attribute. I chose a Half Elf because...well I haven't figured that out yet, and after well over a year of low WIS stats I started a Halfling Druid and gave him all my gear.<P>Anyways (I have a tendancy to ramble)<P>After reading these posts and determining which things would help and so on...Here's my 2 cents<P>CHARM LINE: There's a few ideas that I like here. Since Druids are 'supposed' to be nature friendly, I like the idea of it being a Skill rather than a spell. A druid should 'naturally' be able to befriend animals to either protect (No commands), or do our bidding (Command based). Summoning an animal or casting on one imo does not go along with the Druid way. Summoning (casting) should be left to the pure casters. (No offense Shamans) Also the animals should definately be 'happy' to do so. (meaning no agro). I've always thought the agro thing was stupid and off base as far as Druids are concerned. (Balance issue or not, someone wasn't doing their research)<P>HEALING: To tell you the truth, because of my limited play time I have not seen the effects of group healing or the higher lvl problems. But all these voices can't be wrong. As far as what lvl to move Superior Heal to? I think to assuage the 'slap-in-the-face' comment that was mentioned before, I think a resonable solution would be to move it to 49.<P>QUAD KITING: This shouldn't be an issue with other classes. unless they have actually done it, they do not realize the risk and downtime we are having to succumb to to do it. If they did understand they wouldn't complain. I also agree that taking away soloing abilities would hinder time restrained people like me from playing. (And a big  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"> to all you power players the think poeple like me are wasing our time.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> )<P>/clear throat<P>TP RINGS: I agree it's time to remove the 'dungeon only' restriction from the evacs. I think that is a pointless restriction at this time. I do agree that Surefall Glades would be an ideal spot. running through WK is a pointless pain in the butt. I don't see why we can't TP to that side of the continent. Makes no sense.<P>ALCHEMY: Another thing that someone missed in their research on Druids. In almost every depiction I've ever seen or read of a druid, alchemy was part of their life. I don't believe that the addition of this skill would unbalance us in any way, i think it would give us something else to do that goes along with our nature (no pun intended).<P>As far as the 'fluff'. I don't think they are a bad thing. It adds to the role playing aspect for those who want it. Would it really hurt if you could /sit like a dog, or /beg like one? No it doen't help with group apeal but it does make the game fun. (Isn't that why we bought it?)<P>I may not have put forth any new ideas. I just wanted to post in support of some that were said and put my own twist on them.<P>Thanks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I also think we need some debuffs as powerfull as the shamens , different but as powerfull.<P>People talk about quad kiting alot , this makes me laugh . Do the math if you dont belief me but quad kiting is not efficient in getting fast xp. Find out cast times and mana cost for quad kiting and compare to the 'root dot' method. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000393-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000393.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000393-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000393-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000393-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum14&number=14&thisthread=000393&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum14&number=14&thisthread=000393&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
