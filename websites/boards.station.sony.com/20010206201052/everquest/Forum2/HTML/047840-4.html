</FONT><HR>I have to say I have mixed emotions about this post. I am THRILLED about making those dungeons more worthwhile in grouping at but I feel differently about the exp penalty issues. <BR>Granted I am happy that I will be able to level faster, I have to say that this is kinda assanine. We have been living with the exp penalties for 2 years and are used to it. I am absolutely positive that in order to come to these new conclusions there MUST have been LOTS of meetings and discussions. It would have been better if they had spent that time on things that players view as broken(AE rain spells, group bugs, PVP, tinkering, sound problems in windows 2000, connection bugs, etc.)<P>I guess thanx for "fixing" something that wasn't really broken. Next time use the time to fix things that need it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>   Excellent work, Aradune!  I'm genuinely impressed, particularly with the what I see to be truly trying to step back and *fix* your game.  Even though it sort of got lost in all the flames about drums not working and root/snare being broken I think perhaps last weeks patch was the first patch in a long time where you were trying to do things to *help* the players rather than hurt them.  I hope that this attitude continues.  Your post makes me optimistic and the polite and friendly follow ups by both you and Abashi makes me even more hopeful.  To add my voice to the current tide of compliments, GOOD WORK!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>   That said, it still isn't quite the ideal fix I would have preferred...  I'm a nit picker though.  I would have changed all the experience modifiers to 1, and I *would* have run every character through an experience converter...  Maybe do each server one at a time to avoid the otherwise massive downtime that would incur.  To me, this fix (while definitely a very good thing) feels a little hacky...  This hackiness presents itself in how you describe hybrid deaths taking more exp but coming back faster as well.  As I said, I'm a nit picker but I would have just recalculated everyone's exp and reset the modifiers to get rid of even the possibility of complaints once and for all.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>   Anyway, I hope this fixes a lot of the problems that hybrids and others have had.  Thanks to Aradune and the EQ Live team for finally putting aside the 'vision' and making a change that will hopefully affect all of Norrath for the better!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Yay!!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Way to go Verant. Listening to the boards as the players: presented these exact suggestions clearly and concisely, shouted in all caps that something be done about the issue, fretfully sprawled on a page by a person so frustrated they're at their wit's end because Verant ignores them. It's been suggested, stated and screamed over and over and over and over....<P>And now they make a change, and expect us to be happy with them.<P>The experience penalty has been torn down and lamented by any player smart enough to solve a simple 3rd grade story problem since it became apparent it existed.<P>When the players said it, it wasn't possible.<P>When it was presented clearly and logically and irrefutably, it was part of the core design and couldnt be changed.<P>When people began to stare blankly at a Verant response wondering if anyone there had an ounce of common sense or problem solving ability they still could not be disuaded from their "do nothing" attitude.<P>It was ignored and tossed into the "Something the Players Want But Ain't Gonna Get No Matter How Smart an Idea It Is" file.<P>Then, here's the worst part, when it is finally admitted that there is a problem, they play it off as "Look what we thought of, we're so smart and are making good improvements for the game"<P>The players know what's going on here, most of us. There was not even an apology at the end of the letter, or an explanation as to why they have been so short sighted and narrow minded all this time on the issue.<P>Now here they are with their great solution, about a year too late to be reasonable, and people are ready to throw a God damned parade for them.<P>I'm not happy with Verant. They angered and frustrated a lot of poor people by adamantly refusing to take a look at this issue all this time. Don't let them try to play it like they're some kind of hero all of a sudden because they listened to the only people around here with a clue.<P>Quaid</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Again, I need to repeat that I am all for changing those zones but come ON people.  NO ONE quits because of THEIR class/combo's exp penalty.  People stop playing because they don't like their character anymore, or are caught in a hell level, or are frustrated with their role in the game.  No matter WHAT race/class combo you chose, hell levels SUCK.  Has anyone EVER heard a halfling warrior say, "hell levels aren't so bad, really"  <P>I am really just annoyed that they spent all this time and thought on exp penalties when there are much more pressing issues that need to be fixed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OMG.  Thank you Verant!<P>Just goes to show - never say "never".  This is one thing they said they would "never" change.  So glad they did.  They basically admitted in the post that they knew that we knew that rangers and bards and pallys and sk's are NOT the uber-pwerful classes (far from it, hehe.)  So now everyone gets a fair shake.  We are all equals.  And druids and necros are still the most powerful soloer's if you ask me.<P>Of course, I am already about 5 levels behind my friends (at 40), but I can take it knowing that from here on in it's a level playing field.<P>Thanks again,<BR>a humble bard (and necro, druid, cleric and warrior)<BR>Lyz</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wow.<P>I mean, ... WOW.<P>I love playing hybrids, but it was getting awfully discouraging seeing that little blue line (yes, the line, not the orange bar) move by barely a sliver with every kill.  And being denied groups because I "suck experience".  All for no good reason.<P>Thank you soooo much for having the cojones to fix this after years of claiming that it worked as designed and would/could never be changed.  Admitting fundamental mistakes always takes guts, but this must have been VERY painful.<P>I'm not saying this makes the game "perfect" (is any game ever perfect?) but this fix definitely boosted my respect for the people running things at Verant.<P>/salute</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>-Hawksta<P>Try to read the whole post next time. They didn't say that they had finished balancing the classes, but that this was one of the biggest problems they saw and they decided to fix it. In fact Abashi just made a post on the second page reassuring that these fixes didn't mean they felt the classes were balanced and that this had nothing to do with that issue. I am a shaman too, or was when I used to play.<P>That said, most of the experience changes are great. I wish though that experience were scaled _per mob_ in a zone based on more than on level, since some mobs are just tougher than other even at the same level and should reflect that in the experience given. Owell, hey.<P>Now for what I'm about to say I'm sure I'll get flamed by alot of people. I'm rather sad to see the experience penalty go for certain classes. This probably has alot to do with a strong enjoyment of D&D and games based on that, but the removal of this makes EverQuest seem less and less like an rpg to me, at least the ones I've played. The experience penalty was a convention in most of these games, because it offset the _better abilities_ of these hybrids based on a parent class or the fact they had more abilities. As Verant has now stated the hybrid has never had much of a benifit when compared to say the warrior so the penalty was deemed as a double whammy for classes that in several ways were inferior. Instead of removing the experience penalty, I feel it would have been better if they had looked at the hybrids and given them abilities that _justified_ those penalties. I'm not sure how others feel, but to me experience is the means to an end, getting better skills and better abilities as you level, not the end itself. So I guess really it's not that I'm sad to see the exp penalties go, but that a chance to differentiate and create more interesting classes was wasted.<P>On a similiar note though, I think it's a great idea that this extra experience is "created from thin air" and not exacted from the group. I always felt this was uncalled for. Penalties like that should never apply to the whole group, only the individual class.<P>In conclusion I applaud Verant for the ability to sensibly reevaluate these issues and make such great changes! I hope it continues  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>And by the way, if you want to fight "inflation" and still give players better money/loot in dungeons, just give them _something_ to use that newfound wealth for. Give shamans better utility potions, enchanters the ability to enchant weapons/items, and mages the ability to summon things the player would actually want and you will finally get that player economy rolling.<P>Ourang U'Tahn<BR>Dishevelled Medicine Man of Druzzil Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, this only helps me, being a ranger. However, I cannot get excited about it. As usual, Verant takes the easy way out. Instead of balancing classes, they essentially dump the experience penalty? Well, if we hybrids are so equal to everyone else, why did you put us through hell on fire for so long? Huh? Sorry Aradune, I still like and play this game. But you guys have proven to be too little and too late. This is the wrong way to fix things. I must agree with other posters that this is an obvious attempt to satisfy a vast amount of disgruntled players who like your game but dislike Verant. Hopefully some of your new competitors actually learn from OSI and Verants mistakes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>From what I've seen, Chardok could also use an experience bonus up there with Kaesora and Hole.  At least people camp Kaesora for the fang, but there's only two or three items in Chardok worth getting.  The spell drops in here also don't make anyone do backflips.  This dungeon takes a backseat to Karnor, Sebilis, and Howling Stones, and it is ALWAYS empty on TZ.  I can rarely even put a group together because people want to camp in the friendly confines of nearby and highly accessible Karnor's Castle.<P>Just an idea as I assume those aren't the only dungeons you are open to tweaking.

</FONT><HR>It seems pretty clear who in this thread has played characters on MUDs and who hasn't.  EXP penalties were always an important part of the game.<P>When I played a halfling Bard on MajorMUD it was NORMAL that half-orc warriors with a 5% exp BONUS would level MUCH faster than myself and the same level player would have 1/2 of the total experience MY character had.  That's just the way it was.<P>That is what were are used to.  For me, this HUGE change to exp means the beginning of the end of EQ.  Not that they are giving in to pressure from other games or that nonsense but that they are just trying to placate people until EQ2 is ready to be rolled out.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
