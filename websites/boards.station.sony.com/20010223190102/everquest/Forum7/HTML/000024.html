</FONT><HR>Here is a message I posted to Verant in the Lanys Tvl section, but I think it applies to all servers...<BR>  posted 09-19-2000 11:34 PM   <BR>         My characters name on this server is Xanik. He is a 30th level Shaman. I have worked very hard and at great expense to elevate my character to a skill level of 132 in blacksmithing. Today I have spent over 250PP trying to make the new Scale armor without success, while my colleagues were successful one out of two times on many items. Finally, I was notified that my skill level increased to 118 on the forge. 118? I keep pretty meticulous records, and my level is 132 on the forge, not 118. What the heck is going on? How come there is never a GM on our server to answer questions unless you stay on for hours waiting for a response? I fully expect recompense to be made for the lost plat, and a restoration of my skill level in blacksmithing.<BR>Thank you. <P>Ok, just to keep everyone up to date on the latest in trying to deal with people who refuse to listen.  It took me 20 hours to get a GM to respond to my petition.  Actually 4 petitions, because Guides would answer and gave me such a wide array of possible reasons that I quickly came to the conclusion that the right hand doesn't really know what the left hand is doing at Verant.  Guide Lothir (sic) said there is NO glitch that causes a characters trade level skills to drop.  Therefore he cannot restore my level.  Well, I said, if there is no glitch, then my level must still be at 132, but it is not, therefore I cannot accept the fact there is no glitch.  <BR>     And that's how we left it.<BR>     In short, it appears that VERANT has taken the CUSTOMER out of CUSTOMER SERVICE.<BR>     This is the second unpleasant incident I've had with unresponsive GM's and unknowledgeable Guides.  The first time, I died while zoning, even though my health was very close to maximum.   <BR>     Sorry, Verant said, there is no known glitch that caused that, so you are left to your own devices.<BR>     Of course Verant also tells us that the boats to Kunark work too!  And rather than fix them, they'll just put their efforts in making new expansions.  <BR>     WAKE UP!  We don't want new expansions with NEW GLITCHES.  We want a game that runs smoothly, honestly and fairly.  And we want the people we pay the bucks to, to be responsive and tolerant and kind.  Don't tell me there isn't a glitch when my character dies in while zoning of no apparant causes.  And don't tell me there isn't a glitch when I waste 300PP on a new forge trying to get some cool armor, only to find my efforts are futile because I have just increased my skill to 118!<BR>     If Verant cannot be held to a miminum of service, then we have a tyrant that cares for nothing but our hard earned money.  And that means it is time to begin a cross server boycott of their products.  <BR>     You want service?  Perhaps that's the only way we'll get it.  Otherwise, we will continue to suffer ever GM and Guide imposed indignity offered, while treating us like we are all liars trying to take advantage of the system.<BR>     At 50-years-old, and a major market network affiliate News Anchor and Reporter, I doubt that there would be much reason to try to cheat Verant.  And I believe I represent the majority of people reading this.<BR>     I intend to cross post each of these messages.  My address is hiriter@aol.com.  Tell me about some of the problems you've had with Verant and their GM's and Guides.<P>Steve Delaney AKA Xanik Xeus/30th level Shaman/Lanys 'Tvl and formerly 132nd level master Smith<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Heltar,<P>I realize that you are angry and that it is a pain to raise your skill level back up, but really, it is just an inconvenience.  Please don't bring your hate mongering to the Terris Thule boards.  The fact that it takes forever to get a reply from a petition is a point that has been made over and over again.  Believe me, we know about it.  Also, this is not the way to accomplish anything.  First off, you are from an entirely different server.  The people on our server are an entirely different group.  If you wish to make complaints about individuals, do it somewhere where people in a position to do something about it can.  Secondly, you are never going to move people to follow your decision unless you stay calm and keep the anger out of your posts.  Unless you are inciting a mob riot, people tend to react to anger by becoming more stubborn.  They dig their heels in and you won't be able to budge them.  I will reiterate this one more time.  Please do not bring your hate mongering to our board.  I personally think we have an awesome group on our server and we don't need aggravated people from other servers trying to spread dissent when the complaint is against people that we have no impact on.  The thing you should be rallying for is for Verant to hire more GM's.  A boycott will not accomplish this.  I think I have run on long enough in this post, and I think you get the idea.<P>Kyriz</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am really sorry you missed the point of the posting.  First, I posted cross server, because I was told this was a non-confirmable bug.  I refuse to believe that out of all the everquest players that this hasn't affected anyone else.  I would like to find others with similar problems, so I take my findings to Verant.  Second, this is about customer service, not hate mongering.  I am sure you have the best server in the world, but unless you hold someone accountable for the non-confirmable bugs or lack of service, or complacency, then you will end up with just the game you have.  And it will get worse.  As for the boycott of Verant's new products, I am sorry that you will accept whatever paultry handouts Verant will give you.  My contribution ends with the Kunark expansion, unless they can prove they are addressing all of MY concerns.  And I hope they are YOUR concerns as well.  In fact, from the response I've gotten from the other servers, the only negative feedback to try to hold Verant responsible for game play, has been from schills for the company.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
