</FONT><HR>We've changed this item before because we thought it was overpowered.  Unfortunately, it is still overpowered.  Let me explain why.<P>This item is a breastplate that is only usable by clerics.  If you right click this item, it will cast a Complete Heal on your target with a casting time of 30 seconds.  It uses no mana to produce this effect.<P>A group of two characters, one cleric wearing this breastplate and one warrior, can defeat any opponent, as long as that opponent can not kill the warrior in under 30 seconds.<P>Let me restate that.<P>One cleric and one warrior, using this one magic item, can defeat ANY opponent or any number of opponents that are not capable of killing the warrior in under 30 seconds.<P>I hope that the impact that this game dynamic has on the game is obvious to everyone.  If we allow this item to remain in the game as it is, we will have to change the game so that monsters are capable of killing a warrior in 30 seconds.  15 seconds if the group consists of two clerics with this breastplate and one warrior, and it gets worse from there...<P>Of course, if we make the world so hard that this breastplate is not overwhelmingly powerful, we would have to, essentially, rebuild the game, rebalance the classes…  No single item should be so powerful that the balance of the game revolves around it.  Adjusting the game to fit this item is not a choice.  We need to change the item to fit the game.<P>We have had a fair amount of internal debate over this item.  It really comes down to two choices.  Eliminate the item entirely, or change the way it works.  We would rather change the way it works.  After much debate and some conversations with players that have characters that use this item, we decided on the following change.<P>The item will cast a new spell (to be named later).  The effect of this spell will be to completely heal the target.  The spell will also leave a buff on the recipient that lasts somewhere between five and ten minutes (we are leaning toward a compromise of 7.5 minutes).  This buff will have some small positive effect (perhaps a 1 point regenerative effect), but as long as this buff is on a character, he can not receive the effect of this spell again.  This buff will not be removable until its duration runs out.<P>In practice, what this will mean is that the cleric with a Donal's Breastplate will be able to heal anyone he wants every 30 seconds.  But he will not be able to heal the same person twice unless 7.5 minutes has passed between healings.  The breastplate will still almost completely eliminate downtime due to hit point loss, and it will no longer destroy the game dynamic of EverQuest.<P>There is one concern that we have as to this implementation, and I'd like your feedback on it.<P>There are some cases where a character would have all of his buff slots full and be unable to gain a new buff.  This new Donal's effect would be, essentially, a buff.  We can either have it overwrite a current buff, or have the spell fail if the character has a full load of buffs on him.  I can see arguments for either implementation, and I want to hear your thoughts on it.<P>Yes, we know this is a 'nerf'.  And, frankly, we're willing to nerf this item to save the game as a whole.  We are sorry about ever creating an item that is so easily unbalancing to the game, and we're sorry that we have to change it again.  For now, I can't tell you when this change will take place.  It won't be until after we've finished the work that has us on hold for updating the game.  When I have a better timeframe, I'll certainly let you all know.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Not sure about the actual coding logic behind buffs themselves, but I would think that finding the least "effective" buff... whether you at VI decide it's AC, HP, or what have you (as in symbol line, courage line, etc.) and put some sort of priority on it, but make this buff able to overwrite basically any and all cleric buffs you have on you, as well as any hp/ac buffs any other classes can drop on you.  I doubt this would cause TOO much abuse, but I don't think it's really an option to make it so you're unable to use this item if someone has a full set of buffs....<P>*shrug*<P>Hip-shot on these thoughts, so if there's a fatal flaw, point it out, then fix it.<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Dizriellna T'Vol</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well. to tell you the truth any melee with two clerics can kill almost everthing.. @ lvl 60 clerics have alot of mana. The BP is not what is overpowering, it is the spell CHeal. <P>You can't take away complete heal. I would just up the casting time more.. it is rediculous to add a buff for 7.5 minutes.. Just add a longer casting time. <P>Ask your self what is the purpose of the BP to heal in combat? or to heal after combat.<P>If it was intended to heal in combat.. then leave it as 30 seconds<P>If it was intended to reduce down time after.. make the casting time longer.<P>What you are proposing is not a solution.<P>mec</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor a few of questions to clarify this nerf in my brain:<P>1. At what level is Donal's BP accessible?<P>2. Is it NO DROP?<P>3. At the level it is attainable and useable by a cleric, are there any worth while mobs (ie:  Give Exp, AND loot) that can't kill the average equipped melee'r in under 30 seconds?<P>4. Doesn't the complete heal significantly bump a cleric up in the agro factor, and couldn't the mob kill the cleric in under 30 seconds if the melee'r is unable to taunt the mob off the cleric?<P>5. A cleric without this BP, say a bronze, but grouped with a bard singing mana song, and an enchanter equipped with an appropriate clarity song don't essentially have the same effect? <P>6. If number 5 does elicit the same effect is it ok, because the group is "larger"?<P>Thanks...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Maybe then you will learn to think like the players and can then see these things ahead of time.  And this one was obvious - players were pointing how overpowered this was since the day it was found.<P>But nerfs suck - any nerfs.<P>Last question:  Why is Verant more than willing to nerf an item but you never bump up a weak item.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wondered what FoH meant by their comments of "narrowly avoiding another Cleric BP nerf" back when they first opened Sleeper's Tomb. Now we know. Is this perhaps another in the series of nerfs aimed SOLELY at the top 1% of EQ players, which just happens to effect, in a rather negative way, the other 99%?<P>As I'm not a Cleric, nor ever planning on doing raids, I suppose this doesn't affect me. Still, with the obvious, blatant LACK of playtesting/QA, and one nerf already, plus many, many high-end NPCs in the game that depend on either loads of clerics with this, or about 10x as many clerics without the Donal's BP, they'd leave it alone. I guess that you'll also be fixing the entire Everquest engine so that the massive amounts of ne w clerics/other characters needed won't cause crashing? Thought not. So, you're going to rebalance everything due to the fact that things were almost certainly made with the BP in mind? Nope, didn't think so. This item DOES reduce the number of characters in end-game raids, and even with that, they engine is having serious problems with linkdeath, lag, etc.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well ok but make sure to take all the zone feedback you received for the velious zones and throw it out as it will soon be useless. <P>Many of the new Velious monsters with 200,000+ hp's were defeatable nearly exclusively through use of these breast plates. <P>Please dont just say 'use new tactics' either. There has been almost nothing new strategy wise given to the players since the release of kunark. Velious handed out a couple token spells to spice things up but by no means was anything revolutionary given to the players. What did change was that monsters now hit for twice as much damage on boss encounters while having 5-10 times more hit points. So players are dying twice as fast when they need to stay around 5 times as long... <P>I think it would be safe to say that boss encounters are ATLEAST 5-10 times harder now (linear change with hp's) than they were in kunark. Players are by no stretch of the imagination 5-10 times more powerful and we most certainly can not throw 5-10 times as many people into the fray due to LinkDeath on raids. <P>I agree that this Donal's Breastplate is overpowered but it was the players one loophole to get through terrible Velious boss encounters. I do not mind changing the Breastplate but wait to do it until after you accordingly tone down the velious boss encounters to make sense with the now diminished capabilities of the players. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Actually,that's completely sensible.<BR> <BR>Let the Donal BP effect be a Cheal "buff". Reduce casting time to pre-nerf levels. <BR> <BR>And in fact,I can see something that will allow the massive de-powering of epic mobs across the world.<BR> <BR>Make Cheal a "buff" as well.<BR> <BR>If a meleer can only be effectively Chealed once per battle by anyone,this means epic mobs don't have to have obscene damage capacity to keep up. In fact,with the "one-shot Cheal",mobs need a LOT less power to be able to keep up with the recovery output of healers.<BR> <BR>This one change to Cheal could singlehandedly allow the derailing of the "epic arms race".<BR> <BR>Sweet Hatred,why hasn't anyone thought of this before? Uberoptimization wouldn't be essential anymore,as a hybrid could freaking survive tanking a while even at epic levels. All it takes is this one,simple change to Cheal. You won't need quad hitting for 800 mobs anymore. Fights won't go into mega-LD mode yet still will be challenging. And even mega-mobs that Cheal won't be as bad-because it's a buff and the thing can't keep doing it.<BR> <BR>Wah.<BR> <BR>This could be the cure for the uber-cancer,if it's done right.

</FONT><HR>Drevyn,<P>&gt;&gt;When VI puts in an item... how many people test it? How many scenarios can they come up with?<P>Apparently enough that it was considered ok.  Perhaps the question should be, "How imaginitive are the people that test these things, and do they play the game outside of work?"<P>&gt;&gt;There's just not enough VI peeps to totally think of every devious obnoxious way we can exploit <BR>&gt;&gt;their game. There's not. So when something like this comes through, well, it's an exploit, like an item <BR>&gt;&gt;duping bug in the code or what have you, and we should accept it as such and give constructive criticism, <BR>&gt;&gt;not this negative bulls*it people think they have a right to toss around.<P>See I don't see this as an 'exploit.'  To me an exploit is using a real BUG, an unintended unknown affect of code and taking advantage of it.<P>For the most part, and from the explanation given by Absor, there was "exploit", Verant created an item that worked EXACTLY at they originally intended it to, but discovered that the playing populous is smart enough to realize/think through, the aspects of this item.<P>IE:  Since there was no bug, there is no exploit.<P>"Maybe" the item is overpowered, I'm not sure I want to argue that point since Verant in its sub-infinite wisdom has seemed to deem it so, but the suggested solution is rather problematic:<P>1.  We're taking this overpowered item, and changing it so that we think it's balanced.  <P>2.  Now the total affect of this change is to keep everything the same, but change the availability of recast to 7.5 minutes.<P>I like the suggestion made by someone else earlier, if you're going to make this change, at least significantly DECREASE the cast time on the item.  It would seem that there should be some compensation involved with this nerf, not just some extremely weak (read as NEGLIGABLE) affect that lasts 7.5 minutes.<P>&gt;&gt;Treat VI with a little respect.<P>I would, but I suspect the statement that Verant actually discussed this change with any REAL users other than those on the Test Server, which as far as I'm concerned is about as far from REAL EQ game play you can get without playing AC or UO.<P>I suspect the feed back Verant got was extremely limited and extremely faulty...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>   The buff aspect is a kludge to work around the problem that items cannot have a recast time.  Otherwise, they'd just put a 7.5 minute recast time on the breastplate.<P>   The casting time should drop back to normal once the recast delay is in, of course.<P>   There are quite a number of other bits of armor that suffer from overly-long casting times.  Hopefully, Verant will bump up the priority of coding up item recast times, so that the Donal's can be fixed properly, and along with it, all the others with similarly increased cast times.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>No,some people are right here.<BR> <BR>The problem is Cheal itself. Once in a battle is one thing.<BR>  <BR>Repeatedly allowing it is what's ruining high-level conflicts in EQ. Being able to Cheal something over,and over,and over again it why epic mobs hit so hard that it takes a defensive disc that gives total invulnerability just to TRY and tank them. Remove the total and constant recovery and mobs no longer need to deplete an entire lifebar in one mega-salvo to be challenging.<BR> <BR>Hells,half the mobs in Velious would be a lot more entertaining if the only solution wasn't a single tank and multiple clerics chain-Chealing them.<BR> <BR>Make the Donal's BP a "buff",match Cheal to the same "overwrite and do not allow to be overwritten itself" buff mode,and proceed to nerf monster firepower game-wide at the high level zones. Sanity returns.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Adjantis the problem that you propose is why doesn't Verant forsee all the possible uses their player base of 300,000 people can come up with for an item and implement their items on that.  Can you see the immposibility of that?  I don't know how many people there are working on implementing new things in the game.  Lets be VERY generous and assume Verant has 100 desingers coming up with new stuff to put in the game.  Thats 100 guys with multiple duties in the coding and design of the game, vs 300,000 people, some of whom PLAY the game FAR more than the developers work at DESINGING the game!  It is virtually immpossible for them to cover all scenarios.  They try to come up with nice stuff to give us, and the Uber_punk_01 sees it, plays with it for 200 + hours and figures out an unbeatable exploit that severely damages game balance.  If you can't see how its beneficial for them to change it, then your obviously a) Not a game designer and b) Don't care that the game is somewhat fair and balanced for all players.<P>Narath if you can't see the blatant logic flaw in this statement &gt;&gt;series of nerfs aimed SOLELY at the top 1% of EQ players, which just happens to effect, in a rather negative way, the other 99%?&lt;&lt; then I really feel bad for you.  Exactly how does a nerf of a BP dropped by Trakanon affect the 99% of the population again?<P>BTW I play a cleric, so technically this is *screwing* me too.  But I'm a reasonable person also.  This is a much better solution than the other proposed, making more mobs able to kill warriors in under 30 seconds.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 11 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-11.html">11</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052857&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052857&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
