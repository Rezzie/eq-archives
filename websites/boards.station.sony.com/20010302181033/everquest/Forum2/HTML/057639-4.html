</FONT><HR>This is Great, I'd like to see paladin's get balanced. I'd like to say thanks to Absor for reading through all these well thought out posts.<P>In my opinion paladins are quite unbalanced compared to even the Shadow Knights, not to mention the more desirable group classes, like the pure melee and pure casters. <P>These are my issues<P>1. Paladins don't do crap for damage, we used to have good weapons to offset our lack of dual weald, kick, slam, whatever. Sense the two hander nerf (which was a long time ago) Two handers aren't nearly as good as one handers and ever sense Kunark our weapons just don't cut it. Warriors got Lamintations. Rangers got amazing lupin Daggers. Monks got well lets not even compare monk weapons. Shadow Knights got Noctivigant blade (superior to Sword of Morning) and Mace of the Shadowed Soul (far superior to Dark Metal Holy Water Sprinkler). I'm not sure if bards or Rogues got some awsome stuff. But Warriors rangers and monks got some sweet stuff. Which is understandable. SK's got some good stuff which I think could be better even, (remeber they don't dual weild ither) but Paladin's really didn't get a cut in new high end weapons, or mid range for that matter. Sword of Morning is nice but we really need more options. look at our weapons the way I do:<P>1-20 (everyone had Silvery axes and PGTs)<BR>21-50 (every paladin I ever met was using his Ghoul Bane with a few soulfires mixed in)<BR>50+ Ither sword of Morning, Sprinkler, Or Defender.<P>We really need some more weapons.<P>2. Defense skill and AC it is a general thing that dosen't need to be repeated, although one post above had the benifits of damage avodance over AC and I think he was right on the effect of armor should be increased not avodance skills deacresed.<P>3. Spells lets look at our spells realistically. We have a few nice heals mixed through the lvls decent buffs if there is no cleric (which NEVER happens on any raid) and everything else is garbage we cast because we are sick of seeing our typical often slow weapons go up and down. Stun only has a limited usefulness, yaulp is worse than garbage, blind'l get you killed everytime because of pathing, and root is nice but almost all the other classes have two or 3 steps up on us. Flame of light was a nice thought but it is too little too late. Divine Might is one of our only real winner offenseive spells.<P>What would be a great balancer for our class which dosen't nuke well (ranger) dosen't support damage/life tap (SK)?<P>Absor have you ever played Final Fantasy Tatics for me one character in this game is THE paladin, Orlandu He was a Holy Swordsman. He used his sword to cast FAST, EFFECTIVE, VERSATILE spells. This is what our class needs our combat skills don't really fall to short for a class that can cast. (more defence though <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> I think the greatest balancer for our class would be a far greater line of stuns(AE stun-nuke-taunt?) more roots(AE root?), at higher lvls FASTER versions of G-heal (a nice quick group heal would be amazing!) and a stackable buff line. <P>The main problem with our healing "strength" is our just plain crap casting time G-heal is just too slow to be combat effective for a melee class although it is a very balanced spell for the level we get it at.<P>ALTERNATIVE: A good alternative and a very logical one is give hybrids (all hybrids) a MUCH MUCH higher channeling skill, or a "channeling speacalize skill" this would help our classes ALOUT. It also makes sense because we are always casting while in hand to hand combat with huge, fast, and deadly monsters, right up toe ta toe with them. It only makes sense that we would learn to cast our spells as fast as possible and recover from getting hit while casting these spells in between sword swings. I'd honestly like to see ANY caster go up and cast/melee and pull off spells while fighting (hitting and getting hit bye) a huge beastie as well as somone who while not casting as advanced spells has done it all there life. Yet a caster has a mucho high recast rate, and cast time reduction (I herd channeling reduced casting time never really been able to test it though)<P>Anyway that was my rant I don't think we need or should have disiplines this should be the area of the person who has always focused souly on their combat skills and not in the art of channeling energy as well. I do think we need more weapons and better spells/skills *cough* (defense <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>Thank you very much for caring about this Absor and Verant I hope we can balance this class and make us a little more group/raid worthy.<P>Sincerly<BR>Saraphim Du`Ange<BR>Paladin of The White Tower on Tunare<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The simple fact is, with the price that people playing EQ are forced  to pay for failure (corpse runs, lost XP etc), they are always going to  choose the option with the least possibility of failure. They are going to choose the classes who perform certain roles better than any other, they are not going to choose a defensive tank with useless spells and a laughable damage output. As has been stated earlier -  Defense. Does. Not. Stack. <BR> <BR> When given the choice between a class with a high damage output who can also take a lot of damage, and a class that can't take as much, and outputs vastly less, what normal person is going to take the latter? Don't try to tell me that our spells make up for the vast gap between the two classes, because the people here who actually play the class know that they do not. <BR>              <BR> That is our problem. We are not useful within the dynamics of a game where our two parent classes dominate. <BR>              <BR> No one wants to be useful only when there is no other option. No one want to be obselete, but this is where we find ourselves as high level paladins.   <BR> What is our role?  <BR>              <BR> Are we defensive tanks? <BR>              <BR> The concept of the defensive tank, without a higher defensive skill than all others, is a vision that is doomed to failure. How can a class be defined by their defensive abilities, when those abilities are superceeded by classes who also have other advantages above and beyond defense? What are paladins the best at?  <BR>              <BR> What is the thing that makes people say "hey, let's get that paladin for our group"? <BR>              <BR> When you hear someone shout "group looking for war/pal/shd" you will know that the classes are balanced. <BR> <BR> "Mad hatter"'s vision still says it best: <BR>               <BR>   Monk - 70%O 30%D <BR>   Ranger - 60%O 40%D (spells included) <BR>   Warrior - 50%O 50%D <BR>   Pally - 30%O 70%D (spells included) <BR>   SK - 40%O 60%D (spells included) <BR>              <BR>              </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well people now for my 2 cents worth in this entire little collection of ideas and other things. I have read alot, some things i agree with others i do not. I will not cover things which have already been covered just merely want my 2 copper worth in this forum.<P>Damage shields.<BR>Druids and rangers get them<BR>Mages<BR>Necro's<BR>Bards<P>Why not let Clerics and Paladins get them?<BR>But instead of all damage make it undead damage only i know that these type of spells will be great on raids in unrest, the hole, Lower guk <BR>and other places.<P>say start out small and slowly increase say start <BR>at a 4hp dam and up to say 20hp stack this with bash and your normal attack and i think there is something decent.<P>Now in almost every game i know of, Paladins and Clerics have a "Ward Evil" or Banaish Evil spell one way or another.<P>Now what you may ask is Evil in the world of everquest? <BR>Skele's<BR>Were-animals<BR>Necro's (pagans)<BR>Sk's (same as above) <BR>Dark races (play on a team PvP and you will find this out the hard way) :P<BR>anyways the list could go on.<P>My final gripe would be FA Great wep really it is<BR>but it's a combination of Goulbane and Soulfire<BR>put two and two together, wouldn't it be nice to have it's current stats, but either extra damage Vs Undead or maybe the proc does 2x-3x dam against the undead?<BR>Or maybe even extra attack bonus or something along that line.<BR>After all every Paladin must have it's <BR>Holy Avenging Blade<BR>FA is EQ's version of it. So why not let this reflect a Paladins might?<P>The other thing i think have been placed in other peoples posts so i will not back track<P>Thankyou all for your time.<P>Technomancer Holyvengeance<BR>38th Paladin <BR>Sentinels of Justice <BR>Talon Zek Server<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The #1 thing Paladins have going for them are they are probably the best taunters in the game.<BR>The #1 thing Paladins have gogin against them is the damage out put of Scrawny gnolls. Just increase the damage out put, plain and simple. Give us an Epic 1hder and an Epic shield. These are things Paladins have been screaming for since for as long as I can remember. There are a lot of little bits and pieces of the class that need attention but, I think starting with dmg and a better 1hd epic is the place to start. <P>In the "vision" of Balanced classes - I don't see in the way EQ is designed that the classes will ever be balanced when there are so many different play styles IE: large raids, the 6 man grp, or solo. The simple fact is that Paladins are not very well desired in 2 of the 3 play styles.

</FONT><HR>It is time for a paradigm shift in thinking about paladins and warriors.  Paladins should be the best defensive tanks in the game but we are not. Deepwater is 21 ac and crafted is 25.  We need to be the knight in shining armor with 29 ac. Our shields should be 75-100ac.  Yes 100 ac im very serious. When equipped our ac should be significantly greater than that of a warrior.  Our job will be to take damage and duck behind our shield and use taunt and stun to keep the mob on us.  Give us the armor and shields and 1HS weapons to allow us to be the defensive tanks that everyone thinks we are. Yes our damage output will be low much lower than a warrior or monk. We will die a lot being hit on the most, but we are paladins it is our job to be in the front and get beat on.<P>Akrux Daprovisioner<BR>Veeshan server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

We have been so unwanted at high levels for such a long time is it too much to ask for a little catchup.  <P>Please stop thinking of paladins as 3/4 warrior and 1/4 cleric we are Paladins and treat us as a unique class with unique skills, spells, weapons and armor.

</FONT><HR>Verant you have alot of nerve even trying to call us defensive tanks. Why in the heck would we be defensive tanks when our defense is the same our armor is not as good and all our other defensive abilities are less that of a warrior. I think that by defenition if we were defensive then we would have greater skills than that of a warrior in the defensive area. Give us a role for crying out loud rather than that of a beating post. I see no logic in where you are going with this class. If you really want to call us defensive tanks our skills in all defensive abilities should be as good as a warrior if not better and our armors should have great ac. Don't even call us defensive tanks till then, until you do that we're just beating posts that rarely hit back.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think some of you guys should go take a look at the other class threads.  Looks like everyone thinks that their class is unbalanced!<P>I refute the idea that any other class should deal more melee damage than Warriors!<P>I do not understand why you all think that Rangers should be able to deal more damage than any other melee class.  Why?  Traditionally Rangers have not been so.  Their balance lies in their abilities to track, and their oneness with nature, giving them abilities to cast nature based spells.  DAMAGE is not BALANCE for every class.<P>Rogues shouldn't be able to out damage Warriors either.  Their balance lies in their cunning abilities to find remove trapes, evade their opponents, deal sneak attacks when the enemy is un awares, and find/remove traps.<P>Monks, do you really think that your fist hurts more than a Warrior's axe?  I don't think so.  Perhaps you will hit more accurately and more often, and dodge more hits but not damage more.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello my fellow Paladins  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>There's a patch coming this next wednesday 02/21/01.<BR>Well see what is Verant's vision of a pally then,hopefully there's someone that works for verant and plays a pally that will say hey guys we need some help here.(/yell)<BR>I'll try to stay positive and hope that my 130 hours of playing my pally,along with my year and 7 months of paying 10 bucks a month ( not including the expansions packs) didn't go to waste cause i chose a class i thought would be wanted in every group,Oh wait here's the vision this a group game not a solo game.Well then how come us pally's can't find a group?? &lt;needs an xplanation about this.<BR>I think people at Verant are very intelligent to come up with game like this and i hope they realized we all are humans and we make mistakes,so why not try to mend our mistakes by making us a decent and respected class in this game,not the joke we have become.<BR>I really would like see some changes very soon,but as ye seen there's only one blue message in this topic at the beggining&lt;wonders if they even care?&gt;<BR>This will be my last post till wednesday after Patch,Hopefully by then i'll have something positive to post about the vision.For now i will keep gathering my thoughts and praying that someone in verants creates a human paladin from scratch and realizes why are we all asking for these changes when they shouldv'e been done a long time ago.Maybe by then they will realize jow hard pally's have it.<P>Anubi Dragonslayer&lt; the very discouraged Pally&gt;<BR>58 paladin of Marr&lt; Yep still 58 cause the even green mobs own me&gt;<BR>Tarrew Marr server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Pallys are not asking to do as much damage AND take as much damage as warriors..<P>Most of us want a small increase in Damage - maybe 10%, and a 20% increase in Defense, so we take more dmage than wqarrioirs but still deal substantially less.<P>Make Paladins the definitive Shieldbearer. The walking ironworks. But remeber we dont have dual weild, we never will, so even if our damage dealing skills were identical with warrioir, our damage output will always be substantially lower....<P>Tsun (Retired due to the lack of hope, now playing a barb rogue with better ac than his paladin).<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Adding to list:<P>Valorium armor drops in Plane of Fear:<BR>The (in)frequency of the male FFs themselves in Fear cause this armor to be very, very rare. I have been on over half a dozen Fear raids seeing not one piece of Valorium drop; half of those times not one male FF spawned. Please re-evaluate the spawn % of Male vs Female FFs in Fear and/or allow a certain % of Valorium to drop on both females and males.<P>Casting on lower level characters:<BR>It seems that some of the hybrid spells can't be cast on lower level characters because they are post 50th level spells for the hybrid. But these spells are actually lower level spells for their parent class, and the parent class can cast them on lower level characters.<P>Deffensive skills:<BR>Dodge, parry, reposte upgrades I noticed on Test, but please include Deffense as well.<P>Bash:<BR>Please do not allow the attack round of bash to be used when you "can not see your target" or "you are too far away". If you try to click on a spell when your target is "too far away" you will get the message, not spent mana. Allow us to keep our bash round as well.<P>1Handed swords:<BR>Please increase the amount of 1handed swords in the game that are geared towards sword/shield combos. A majority of 1h swords, I see, are being geared towards duel wield in mind.<P>Thanks,<BR>Rev</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I don't see at all why anyone would still want a paladin over a warrior if we do become the best class at defesense, the reason is this, the faster you kill the thing, the less damage you take.<P>I'm only lvl 20 and I missed 7 times in a row with a maxed out skill yesterday on an orc centurion in west commonlands. How sad is that. Verant should concider that fact that its pointless if we can take more damage, the groups will still take the tanks that can dish out the damage becuase they would still be better tanks than we are.<P>I know almost all of the higher lvl paladin weapons and we have some pretty good ones, but it would be nice to have more of a selection. I would also like to see paladins with better weapons than all the other classes becuase our offense is not as good and it would offset dual wield. We also need more 1hs, 1hb type weapons. We have about 3-4 that the higher lvls will use in this category.<P>The armor issue, I think, is a bigger problem than you realize. In groups I'm beggining to see warriors starting to wear crafted. While I make just us much cash as them, I am about 1/3 of the way on money needed for even the legs of the armor of ro. I think you should make that quest a little easier or make the armor give better stats & ac to balance the risk vs. reward problem there.<BR>Deepwater is more of an issue than you think. From what I've seen warriors, rangers, etc. get something from their armor that they cant already do, why are our effects only things we can do our effects that no longer effect higher lvl mobs such as stun. You should really think about this problem.<P>VERANT FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, MAKE PALADINS THE CLASS THEY SHOULD BE, ONE OF THE BEST IN THE GAME, NOT THE WORST.<P>Paladins always seem to be one of the best, if not the best class in many games, why are they so horrible in this one?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057639-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057639.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057639-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057639-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057639&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057639&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
