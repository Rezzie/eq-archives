Time to get the tractors out and hit PoG and look like every other 50+ cleric on the server.<P>You just dont get it. 30 sec cast time that can be interupted is allready a huge risk. I have to make the choice to risk other party members while healing one. 7.5 min recast on a player time LOL. WHATEVER.<P>Isn't this supposed to be a GAME and are not games supposed to be fun. Why don't you try to put some new fun aspects in it instead of spending your time nerfing HARD EARNED RARE ITEMS. GOD I wish i didnt have 100+ Days of my life invested in a hobby that others can waltz in and change negatively for me. <P>Please stop and try using your time and resources in a way that makes us want to stick around for Star Wars and EQ2. With your history in customer satisfaction I will not be giving you any more revenue for future games. My Household has 3 accts.

</FONT><HR>ok let me get this whole solution from a ROLEPLAYING point of view...<P>A guild works several years to get the power to slay an undead dragon that is hundreds of years old, with many losses during the fight. Let me say this clearly. This dragon is FIERCE.<P>The loot of the dragon contains a very old, charred breastplate from a cleric called Donal... and this breastplate has had some great magic cast upon that makes clerics able to fully heal a warrior from their group.<BR>So they go around, wear it with pride, knowing that they are one out of 10 other clerics in the world that wear one of those. So they got something thats totally RARE. And they know that they can use it to heal others where other clerics would run out of mana, which makes them happy.<P>Now, roleplaying aside...<P>did you actually THINK that cleric/warrior teams would run around and kill all those little blue mobs which wouldnt waste a warrior under 30 seconds? Do you really think they would SOLO that much? You know how BORING soloing is? Why should they do this?<P>/ponder<P>and even IF the BP was overpowered... so are the best guilds on some servers... Why not make the whole game a little more fun and let the BIG guilds kill what they want?<BR>WHY NOT?<BR>What is so BAD about 1% of players going and killing King Tommax or Veeshan or who the heck?<BR>Why shouldnt they?<BR>Why are you destroying the fun of these guilds?<BR>Just leave items as they are, and leave the fun with the customers... hell is it so hard to understand?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Reading though all these posts I'm not sure what to say. First off I think nerfing the BP yet again is just plain stupid. There are so many things you can say with any items for a number of classes in the game could do that they couldn't do before they got that item. Not to mention there are tons of things that can kill a warrior in under 30 seconds. It's just and excuse. I guess if you feel the need to Nerf the BP why don't you just change it around. Give the clerics something they would be happy to have. Other then BP all the donals armor is useless. I see other classes getting effects on armor they actaully use. Clerics get 1 peice they could actaully use and it gets nerfed to hell. Give the BP Invs or maybe in Group AC buff or Ageolism. Something useful. Clerics buff and heal. You take away the effect of the heal cause it makes us overpowerful. Then give us a buff. There is no way a buff can overpower us. (Well i'm sure you could screw up and make it) but maybe you could look at the future of the game a little before you put the effect it. I have to agree with most that a 7.5min recast and still have a 30second cast time is just foolish. It's kinda like how you Fixed MoK. Bascially instead of taking the spell out you made it useless. Much like the BP will be. I hope you re-think your options and maybe give all the clerics a say in what they would like to see done.. <P>AcidiC Maarr &lt;Prophecy&gt;<BR>Bertoxx<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This whole concept is ridiculous and I will point out why:<P>"A warrior and a cleric can kill every mob if the warrior survives 30 seconds"<P>Ok, a warrior and a cleric go to Kael and pull some named giant. Then they will kill him slowly but steady. Why? Because of MANAFREE heal. <BR>Remember....shamans can solo to lvl 60 in Sebilis because they get slow/regeneration and a MANAFREE nuke!<BR>The whole concept of MANAFREE was designed to save downtime. Unfortunately it will be 'abused' in practice and used DURING fights instead.<P>And here is THE solution.: Downtime AFTER fight means a NON fighting situation. Get the idea? Remember Scale of Wolf or Invisibility? If you cast of fight the effect of those spells will go poof. This points us in the correct direction.<BR>The effect on the Donal's BP has to be a DoT heal like Celestial Elixir BUT with the difference that it will go poof when you are fighting. That way you can control the downtime too. If you want 2 minutes downtime...then make it last for 2 minutes. If you want 30 sec...then make it last for 30 sec.<P>Simple solution isn't it?<P>Neric Soulstalker (57 nec Xegony)<BR>Shandrax Illuminis (60 enc Xegony)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> Heaven forbid you have to tune the game around an item. Don't you already do that. I'm sure you've tuned the game around warriors with armor, and everyone with weapons. Those are ITEMS too. Half the complaints you get from healers/casters is that they never get any cool items. All they get is +int/wis and +hp/mana. Finally, they got something which was *GASP* an alternative to a spell. This evidently is against 'The Vision (TM)'. I have never understood why you have been so against new items/spells for casters. It's almost the same thing as new weapon drops for every melee class. It makes them do more damage/time. Or, more healing/time. <P>Creed</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, as it seems you are going to take off the CHeal whatever people say here, but please, don't replace it with another useless CHeal! (or soon to be nerfed one).<BR>At least, make an effort and think about a cool spell for the BP, a usefull one.<BR>I would love a home's Temple self gate (Neriak for DE, Rivervale for Halflings, Felwithe for High Elves, etc.), or maybe a combat related usefull thing, or a totaly new spell which would be usefull.<BR>I like the idea of a "totaly" new spell, because since day 1, i'm using/doing the same things always, heal+buffs. The only "new spells" (i mean out of the spell lines considered as cleric's, heals buffs and such) were Mark of Karn (nerfed, ok it needed some but you passed the line to where the spell is now a waste), the Pet hammer (do i need to comment *again* on it?), the Death Pact and Divine Intervention, which both are useless (hope you read my previous post in the Cleric's threads  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif">), the Celestian healing regenerative things, which are the only good ones, but still can be considered and the standard healing line of spells.<BR>I don't know what the tuning team is ready to do or to give to Clerics, so give us some feedback and we could give suggestions on what would be the lesser of an evil in the story. I know you don't have high level Clerics in your ranks, else he/she/they would have warned you long ago about that BP (i won't quote again your post saying that the BP is not overpowered, as it drops off high level encounter mob and very few people will own one, june or july 2000). Maybe discussing the change of that effect among the team and coming here with several possibilities and have some feedback on them could be a good idea. At least i could express some sort of choice on what the nerf will be.<P>I really hope you won't mess *again* the nerf, too many were done to us, i'm tired, and bored.<P>Cwell, 59th cleric.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Getting Donals BPs and leaving them the way they are is the ONLY way of beating alot of the mobs in Velious.  Its just a natural progression Absor, jesus.  Dont nerf it, think about it.<P>Going up against some of the harder stuff in Velious, think about the coincquences.  The you make the above changes to a donals BP no one will EVER beat the Vindicator or Yelnak.  Some fights in Velious were obviously designed to take 10 - 15 minutes.  Efficient healing is the ONLY way to make a team survive 10-15 minutes vs a critter dishing out double 500s +.   <P>So lets say you make these changes.  Your "Vision" includes a 500,000 hps critter requiring 30 clerics and 30 necros?  Is that what I am understanding?  No Absor, there ISNT another way.  Thats how those 500k hps mobs go down, about 36 elite sobs get together and whack it down.  6 of them need to be clerics at least with a couple necros for mana.  If you change Donals BP now that same encounter will take AT LEAST 12 clerics and 12 necros (one dumping each cleric for all he is worth)  Thats 24 people on the HEAL team?<P>I dont ever want to see any encounter take more than 6 groups.  Past 6 group you are in violation of your legal agreement with the customer that this game will run on a XXXMhz pc with XXX megs of ram and a dial up internet connection.   Thats right, you are violating your legal agreement with your customer when you make encounters that take above 36 people because alot of peoples PC's that MEET THE SPECS on the Velious game-box cant handle 50 player models on their screen running around, and I sure as hell know my 33.6 modem cant transfer all that crap to me.  =P   Thx LD ^_^</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR> Do you really think that the cleric who gets one of these bps can't ALREADY kill every single mob in this game with just him and a warrior or a small group? Hate to break it to you, clerics.. yes even you Xan.. who get this bp are already good enough to kill all the blue stuff, run seblis blindfolded, etc. They're also %90 part of a large guild. There is almost 0 utility gained from the ability to take a war and a cleric off and kill blues. You can go.. I dunno, farm some inferior loot in Seblis I guess. Maybe.. *GASP* get some xp. Again, I really HATE to break this to you. But the vast majority of the time and fun I've had in EQ has had absolutly NOTHING to do with getting xp.<P>Creed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok  i am a 56 cleric on the Rathe and dont own or hope to own a donal bp anytime soon. My guild is just not large enuff and they are just way to rare. But this nerf is bull. I have seen this bp in use on one raid i went on. yes it helped  but no it did not make it a piece of cake we still lost many to the king and  queen in chardok. The big question you have to ask your self is this. How long does a  lvl 60 cleric with Clarity 2 , Gift of brillance and Bard mana song  take to med 1 complete heal then sake the cast time on the bp 10-15 seconds  longer. Because weither or not your cast spell that you medded for  or cast bp spell goes off, they  can both be inturrupted and they both heal with a net change of zero mana. just the BP casts a little bit longer.  Thats it period, end of nerf. if you feel its any more unbalanced  you might just need to pull complete heal out of the game. Which will cause 95 percent of the high lvl clerics to quit because after you give the shammies and druids  remedy and divine light  we will have no reason to be in a group. Chanters will take over our AC buffs , Druids will do our HP/AC buff with bonus mana regen, Shammies will talisman and resist buff. THe only way you can have stratigies that involve more then 40 people is if they all play on T1's with the datarate cranked . My 56k modem Chokes on most raids and i have a very  very high end computer.<BR> If you dont like the BP just change the effect to a gate to temple spell self only  and give us a personal form of mana regen that stacks with chanter buffs  or simpler yet just turn on the manastone for all zones and make it start dropping again  in velious some where off  an ubermob and sacrifice doesnt count cause its a proc not an effect and make it and all existing manastones no drop.<P>I also wouldnt mind a limit on cheal of  at 39 it heals for 75%hp up to 60 it healing 100% that may fix the overpoweredness of the spell while making it still be usefull at the lvl we get it but its use wouldnt make out till we did  and not nerfing it to oblivion<P>And just admit you screwed up in velious. with 95% of the content for  that top 1%. Its not fair to say they need new strategy  when you cant have new strategy due to the  fact that more then 40 people in  a small space makes everyone go ld. if you want epic uber battles make minizones  with just one huge Mob in the zone  that  you can only see part of and like  12  zone in points  so  12 -24 seperate  groups can zone in and fight mini battles against the big nasty, everyone in the zone takes dmg from the AOE and everyone is fair game for summoning. but the groups are far enuff away from each other that lag and server overload dosnt kick in.  Then once mr big nasty is dead and the corpse looted  it reveals the zone point to the next mini labrythine zone to the next ubermob zone. that way  the bp is nerfed as is. People get the epic battle your trying to give them.  your odds of keeping your players happy and paying go up <P>And unless your group is all Warriors  your not gonna cast  the BP cheal on everyone. The chanter would be dead in less then 10 sec  usually less then 5 , so is the wiz , mag  necro even. So unless you make this cheal buff an instant cast  its not gonna be usefull for more then one cheal. <P><BR>As far as making it a buff if you make it a buff make it aegolism but stack with symbol and our ac buff that way it can overwrite  Hero/Aego and in return for making us  bored trying to sit on our butt and med  and let our group members have enuff life/AC to even come close  to surviving the min it takes for  them to taunt the mobs off us, for us to start getting hit the second we sit down to med, repeate the cycle, we cant med  were oom and cant cheal the tank cause he was already chealed  when i first went out of mana. The other cleric who also is out of mana and also has the bp  goes to cast  and  now oops tanks dead cause it didnt stick, now im dead  there goes everyone else. Time for Summon and Rezzin. <P><BR>The flaw in your argument is this  sure a cleric with the bp and a warrior lvl 60  can take a mob down if he lives for 30 seconds but against many 55+ velious mob hes not gonna even make 30 with out multiple clerics chain Casting the 10 second heal. <BR>My guild raided skyshrine and made to the big gel cubes up top. they instantly killed our lvl 60 pally, im sure a warrior would have lasted more then the 2 second our pally did but im sure no way is he gonna last 30 with out some 10 second heals already going off.<P>Ok i've been up all night as i write this so i hope you can get the root of my toughts<BR>Tymothy Lyfegiver<BR>56 Templar of Tunare <BR>THe Rathe<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

(page 5 or 7 or something, it was a long post too.)  I play a level 57 shaman.  Yeah I'm another "whiny shaman" that wants a better heal.  SO WHAT?!  The *manual* describes that shamans are HEALERS.  You're damn right I should have a better heal.  *That* is why I started a shaman.  Shamans are the clerics for the primitive races with some offensive power too.  Ogres, Trolls and Barbarians have the highest hit points naked/unbuffed of any warriors in the game.  But their "healers" can't even keep up with the damage they can take.  I don't want complete heal.  But I do want a spell that is capable of healing a tank on a raid when that tank is taking hits from a mob I can't slow (ie any of the numerous kunark and velious mobs that are 100% immune to magic).<P>Beja:  [quote]Its ok guys, shamans/druids will be getting better heals soon.

</FONT><HR>Nerfed my chestplate... The one item is was driving for more than ANYTHING in EQ. My entire character/goal for EQ was the Donal armor. The chestpeice was the crown jewel. And now it is gone too... Simply because verant has poor testing/imgination. <P>Well, this is it. It took me way to long to realize that...<P>1. I am paying to beta test verant's game that they WILL NEVER GET RIGHT. I don't mean an end to the evolution of EQ, but they have made this kind of mistake MANY times. It obviously isn't going away, they are not learning anything from it.  They're apologies aren't worth squat. (bonk you on the head "sorry", bonk you on the head "sorry", Bonk you on the head "sorry", doesnt cut it.)<P>2. When there is something that is benefiting a player, then the servers come down for 3 hours for an "instant" patch to fix the "bug".  When there is a Verant mistake that hurts the players, then it gets fixed "at the next patch" (Most recent was the bards drums)<P>3. I have found the game to be very linear. Kill Kill Kill. there is very little to do otherwise. Really think about it. Kill the trak to get my ... oh nevermind...<P>4. I have spent the last year and a few saying "aw no", "not again", "oh man", and "no please don't XXXXX this" Every patch brings dread, not relief. What are they taking away this time. And then, we finally get one that was a no brainer (hybrid exp) and they follow it with this.<P>5. This is not what I signed on for. I can't believe it has become what it is.<P>Thank you verant for destroying a great idea.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I'm sure it will effect the clowns racing from day to day trying to kill the biggest and meanest critters, but for the avg player this nerf means absolutely nothing.  <P>In all honesty, I think VI is trying to save that uber 1% in the uber guilds from becoming bored too quickly.  It might have a ripple effect to the avg folks just piddling around every night, if they see all the high lvls quitting, but I doubt it (I see that few of them anyways in my zones).  As for the lvl 60 clerics quitting over a bp, that cracks me up.  I wouldn't have wasted my time getting to 60 to quit over a bp.

I do not think that a change is warranted at all. So what if in a group a cleric can just keep chain casting it to keep the warrior alive? If the mob breaks off onto another member they are pretty much SOL for 30 seconds. It is balanced the way it is.

</FONT><HR>STOP AND READ THIS ONE PLEASE!<P>How bout any of these options.<P>1. Just have it consume mana.  Not as much as CH spell and cange the cast time back to prenerf.<P>2. Have it take all the clerics sta. and not be reusable till the cleric is full sta again.  Yes, I know clerics have a stam buff, but still, you efectively have to cast a spell between BP casts, this greatly increases the time to recast.<P>3. Have it consume some of the clerics HPs.  Only put the 7.5 min recast on the cleric himself.  This limits the number of casts from the cleric, and causes the cleric to not be able to use the BP  on himself more than once every 7.5mins.<P>I know when you made the first nerf to this BP I was sickened by it, and actually didnt log in for several weeks.

Okay, I can see that.<P>I think you have to reevaluate the spell on it altogether though. This buff thing is harsh. 7.5 minutes is harsh. Really, perhaps putting Celestial Elixir on it, like the Breastplate of Stability, would be a better fix.

</FONT><HR>They are making a mountain out of a mole hill, like they always do.  I have never even heard of this being done, it is not like a cleric and warrior will go into Sebilis and start soloing the whole zone.  Even if a cleric and a warrior did this, they would still get less exp then a good group pulling 20+ times the mobs that a group of 2 could kill.  No item would be campable in current high level dungeons with a warrior and cleric.  Even if they added an ench, the enchanter would go OOM trying to keep all the mobs mezzed cause a warrior does not take mobs down fast enough.  <BR>Not to mention, the clerics that have the BP in my own experience do not use it all that much in combat.  It is more for downtime after the battle, or "oh crap I am OOM and my tank is dying."  Also it is not like all clerics on each server that over 50 have one.<BR>Nerfing it to 30 seconds is absolutely insane, and using up mana in a good group is the only thing that will keep people alive, not the BP.  Clerics still have to play, they are not just armor click robots.<P>Bayho - 57 warrior, Tunare server<BR>White Dragon Order</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Couple of points here.  <P>First, I can see where Verant is coming from on this.  I remember them saying at one point that if any one item was required for a class to be welcome in a group/raid, then that item is too powerful.  And I can agree with that.<P>Second, VI needs to relook at the epic mobs and uber-encounters in SoV.  They all seem to require either the perfect mix of classes (and I mean PERFECT), or so many people that half of them go LD the first time someone casts a spell.  This is just a sad side effect of limitations in the game (everyone going LD) - but it is the server, NOT the players - people with fast computers and DSL connections are going LD, and that is sad.<P>Third - basically, you are putting a recast time on the BP, for a specific tank.  Sure, works for me.  But can we PLEASE put the casting time of the spell back to something reasonable, 10 or 15 seconds?  A 30 second cast time on any spell is a HUGE risk.<P>Also - can we look at the drop rate on these?  I think they were made uber-rare do to their power level, and if you change the power level you should make them at least a LITTLE more common.  There are, to my knowledge, 3 of these on my server (Prexus).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Well, as frustrating as this type of a change is for Verant's "CUSTOMERS", I don't think there is any reason for us to be insultive.  If the CUSTOMERS aren't happy with the changes, then they should stop paying for the service.  It is as simple as that.  In fact, I think you'll just see a few people quit because of this for there were only a few people fortunate enough to possess these rare items.  <P>If you change the spell CH, as it has existed since the beginning, you will lose a tremendous amount of players and money.  That will be my final straw, as stat loss was my final straw in UO, and then my support will break.<P>I happen to be in a guild which possesses a few of these fine bps (not even a handful in countless Trakanon kills).  I've never seen a warrior and a cleric take down anything useful duo.  Most everything we fight can kill a warrior in under 30 seconds.  By the time you get a donal's, most players are fighting the uber encounters that make these bps a necessity.  If the warrior is defensive, and you have other people helping keep him alive, then the bp is useful and essential for taking down the uber mobs.  Even with the bps, we've lost because everyone ran out of mana and you couldn't keep the tanks alive on bps alone without help.  All of this comes under the heading of new TACTICS.  Verant made very positive changes when they put in the 'epic hp mobs' and made the fights last longer (if you're lucky).  This opened up a whole new realm of tactics, cooperation between players, etc. and seemed to get people excited about the game.  Absor says he can't change a game to fit an item; I agree.  Another point to consider though is that the SoV boss mobs seem to be built around that item so if you nerf it, you'll have to redesign the high end game around that nerf.<P>Another point regarding ch, I'm so sick of people whining that ch is unbalancing.  It is not.  Are clerics much better healers than druids, shamans, rangers, and paladins?  Hell Yes.  They are supposed to be.  This isn't UO where every character can do everything every other character can do.  Druids do things clerics can't do (being more of a hybrid wizard/cleric); shamans are buffing machines with DOTS and some pretty nice damn items (they are witch doctors, not surgeons).  All of those druids/shamans out there crying about CH (it isn't many, just a few "short-sighted" people to turn someone's quote around from earlier), how will you feel when rangers start whining that they can't heal as well as a druid/shaman or that they should get teleport?  This game is class based.  You either play a hybrid (a diluted character who trades being great at one thing for being pretty decent at several) or you play a purist (great at one thing).  The cleric is the purist healer and should be substancially better than every other healing class at that action.  CH is the separation.  I don't mind giving the shamans/druids something like divine light but that should be it.  The damn thing fiszles too much anyway.<P>With regards to Verant's QA efforts and this 'inbalance' slipping through the cracks during testing, you guys don't really expect anyone to buy that I hope.  "Ok, I can complete heal for free, even though it takes a ridiculously long time, hmm.  what will i test first?"  It also didn't take the community 6 months to find.  People were talking about these tactics from the first day we saw the stats.  It is only these tactics and the ability to generate mana efficiently that make this a really nice item.<P>A final question, is someone at Verant getting mad because a very small minority of the game is able to kill a few of the uber mobs?  Considering the rarity of these items, and how so few people have them, and the necessity for these items against the high-end mobs, I think this is silly.  Let's see some positive changes for the players (I.e. implement some ideas from cleric discussion last week) and do something to make them happy, not the contrary.  Who cares if after 9 months of killing trakanon everytime he pokes his head out of his lair, our guild has 2 - 3 of these bps and are now able to spend 8 hours or so of our time and through perfect execution able to take down a boss mob 33% of the time.  Isn't that what this game is supposed to be about.  We're spending time, having fun, and paying you guys money.  Many of us really are near our end.  The competition is building.  This is no time to piss off your customers with unnecessary changes.  Where will it end?  What purpose are you serving?  <P>Whatever you do, test it well before you implement it.  No code is ever perfect and things will always fall through the cracks.  Always look at the obvious first.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This one is totally Verant's fault and I agree that Clerics should be pissed about it.<P>I still think the genesis of this issue relates to the fact that complete heal was a spell created for world where level 50 was max.  <P>Verant was so shortsighted when they added Kunark that they failed to see the need to revamp the entire healing spell tree (changing CH to a fixed hp heal and adding other heals at higher levels)and all their changes between then and now exacerbate the problem, including introducing this bp that casts CH, which arguably was more useful than any epic.<P>Shortsightedness?  Yes, definitely.<P>Should it be corrected?  Debatable, given that uber mobs seem to have been designed around its existence.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alan, Brad, and Gordon:<P>I only read Brad's comments on Caster's Realm, so pardon if the rest of this has been covered by someone else.<P>Kudoes for addressing this.  Please write down as a lesson learned that taking into account mega-items like Donal's in the design of encounters also has the unintended consequence of forcing people to have those items to compete.<P>Also, I believe firmly that one of the flaws in the game is that you designed encounters but allow players to 'break the spawn' in an encounter.  This causes you to have to over-design the encounter and at the same time allows breaking of a spawn and unintended soloing at the spawn.  I hate to refer to the competitor product, but UO (in all 3 hours I have played it in my life) dealt with this a little more sensibly:  all mobs in an encounter popped at once.<P>There is one more item (that I know of) that deserves attention:  jaundiced bone bracer.  It causes competitive problems for Shaman who don't (or in the case of Iksar can't) have one.  Two proposed remedies...one deep and one shallow:<P>1.  The deep remedy is to have items charge half cost for super spells like complete heal or damage spells like that on the jbb.  This ties the limitation to the blue line, and just provides added efficiency for casting with this (essentially) focus item.<P>2.  The second remedy is to up the level limit to 50th.  The effect isn't as stunning or useful if you do this.  I know of one Shaman that gained 3 levels over a weekend from 45 to 48 using the jbb, so it is a major imbalance.  I know people are thinking I'm asking for a nerf of shamans, but I'm not...I'm addressing an issue similar to this one that causes Verant to inflate the monsters to respond to broken items in the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The reasoning behind the nerf is flawed, pure and simple.  You're assuming that a Cleric and a Warrior can even single-pull mobs worth killing for anything but exp, that the mob has no ability to Fear, etc., that the Cleric will somehow miraculously escape aggro after performing a CH - the list goes on and on.  I know people at Verant claim to play the game, but there's a huge difference in taking a new face, giving it powers and a Donal's BP, and testing against a single mob and the game WE play.<P>I've grown to expect more from the new Verant.  This insults not only the integrity of your game (which only with the recent exp changes have I begun to recognize) but also your 10,000+ customers that actually have the item.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>[From Earlier Absor Post]<P>&gt;"Actually, this is a nerf aimed at the top 1% of players, that will only affect the top 1% of players."&lt;<P>"Correct. And even more importantly, if we do not make this change, the game will have to be changed to compensate for it, and that WILL affect every player all the way down the line. This is what we are trying to avoid."<P>=================================================<P>Why not just leave that 1% alone?  Perhaps I am being short-sighted here, Enlighten ( ;] ) me please as to the long term detrimental effects of letting the top 1% of the game be more powerful.  You don't have to keep making things harder so that they cannot win; let them use what they have earned to win.  Don't tell me it is separation and elitism, that will be there anyway.  If we were in a perfect world, and lag were not a factor, I would agree that we might need to try and foster changes which necessitate more players working together.  A huge mob can either be slain with 36 people who are really nasty and make full use of their equipment, or it can take 150 people without things like donals.  Unfortunately, EQ and our current world of internet connectivity won't support any more than the 36 people and for many of your customers that is pushing it.  If anything, the free mana items help the game by making it more likely that a player will help another.  <P>I have administered games in the past and used to have a problem with allowing the players to 'win' from time to time.  After a while, I figured out that this was the reason they were playing.  Of course, I make it challenging.  MOBS are still challenging even with donal's.  At some point, if someone earns something really exceptional and rare (an artifact), they will have earned the right for things to be easier for them than for most.  That is the nature of any game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 11 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;9&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-11.html">11</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052857&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052857&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
