</FONT><HR>Unfortunately, as will probably be the case from here out, I just don't have time to do any research before starting this post.  I'll have to rely on you folks to tell me all I need to know about enchanters…   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Again, the usual reminder.  I am primarily looking for balance concerns here.  But I am certainly willing to put bugs on the list.  Also, though I really do understand the fact that you want to emphasize and back up statements by others, please, please try to keep the repeat information to a minimum.  I'm finding that by page three or four on these threads I'm rereading the same suggestions by people that start their posts with "I didn't read this thread, so I don't know if this had been said…"   I don't want to stifle any creativity.  But I have to admit that I tend to get bleary eyed reading the same suggestions over and over again, and I know I'm missing good new ideas late in threads when they are buried among things that others have covered several times before.<P>So, please, let's hear what you think is unbalanced or broken about enchanters.  Here are the few things that I had already jotted down:<P>Gift of Brilliance:  When compared to similar buffs by Clerics and Shamans this spell doesn’t seem good enough.  Sure, it will see use, but it could be a better spell.  Quick comparison:<P>Aeogolism (60th level Cleric spell):  Adds 1,100 to max hit points and 54 to AC for a single target.  Lasts 2.5 hours.  Costs 750 mana.<BR>Focus of the Spirit (60th level Shaman spell):  Adds 405 hit points, 67 strength and 60 dexterity for a single target.  Lasts 1.5 hours.  Costs 500 mana.<BR>Gift of Brilliance (50th level Enchanter spell):  Adds 150 mana and grants a mana regeneration rate increase of 2 points per tick for a single target.  Lasts 1.5 hours.  Costs 450 mana.<P>The Shaman and Cleric spells essentially replace other buffs.  Gift of Brilliance stacks with Clarity II.  It might be nice to have the mana regeneration be 2 points greater than Clarity II and NOT stack with it so that enchanters could use it to save a slot.  And perhaps rather than increasing the mana bonus, give it an intelligence bonus.  But perhaps at this level enchanters just don't need any more intelligence boosts…<P>Illusions drop when zoning:  Is there a gameplay reason behind the fact that illusions drop when you zone?  If not, can we make it so they do not?<P>More Illusions:  I think it’s a good idea to dig through the list of current global characters and see if there are a few more illusions that we can give to enchanters.<P>I know there are more issues…<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Spells:<P>- Make charm and mezz spells act the same as DD vs Summoned / Undead.  That is, don't let the spell even be cast if it cant affect the mob.  Just return the message "This spell will not work on this mob" and not waste the mana, and incur the frenzy.  <P>- Examine the Lull line of spells (especially Wake of Tranquility).  Currently they are resisted in the extreme, making them useless (read:  useless, not situational.  useless)<P>- Debuffs (Cripple, Weakness, etc) have no discernable affect on NPC's.  Cast any one of these on a PC and the affects are devastating.  Please make modification so that the affects of these spells are noticeable on mobs, similar to how they affect PC's.   A suggestion would be to change these spells to reduce mob stats by percentages instead of fixed amounts.  Mobs seemingly have endless amounts of strength and other stats, so reducing them by a fixed amount has no affect.<P>- Sentinel:  Remove it   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>- Illusions.  Opinions vary on this topic, but some higher level enchanters view illusions as tools instead of toys.  They allow us to venture into hostile territory, so adding new illusions is not a priority unless they serve a purpose.<P>- Enchanter animations are balanced.  The only change I would suggest is making the last animations (level 55) duel wield automatically when summoned.  This is our last animation, this addition would be a welcome change.<P>- Remove recast times on speed buffs (VoG, etc).  This element only serves to be annoying, in a game designed to be enjoyable.<P>- Reduce the component cost of Rune IV, it is unbalanced for the benefits it returns.<P>- Make Reoccurring Amnesia act like a dot.  Cast this spell upon yourself to get an idea of what it is supposed to do, but it doesn't work as it is now.  No reoccurring at all.<P>- The current implementation of Boon of the Garou is unsatisfactory.  It currently lasts 6 minutes for 100 mana with a 3 minute recast time.  Any change would be acceptable, just keep in mind that buffing is not fun.  A suggestion would be make the spell last 30 mins for 500 mana with a 15 minute recast time (5 times the length at 5 times the cost).<P>- Re-adjust the casting time of the Shielding line of spells.  Shield of the Magi has a 12 second casting time.  Is this necessary?  It detracts from the "fun" of EQ.<P>- Umbra appears to be broken.  It doesn't follow the standard AC upgrade of that line of spells.  Currently is it no better than the level 49 Shadow spell.<P>- Memory Flux (level 55) is a single target memory blur that costs 350 mana.  This spell is extremely unbalanced in both it's effectiveness and it's mana cost.  Currently it does not work as well as much lower level memory blur spells (to be blunt, it's only real purpose as it currently stands is to waste large amounts of mana, with no upgrade to it's memory blur affect).<P>- Reduce the enormous agro of the Tash line of spells.  It is completely unnecessary to have this spell agro the way it does.  A compromise can be reached, adjust the agro somewhere between it's current form and that of the level 60 Magician spell Mala.<P>- A heavy price is already being paid in the form of extreme mana cost when using Glamour of Kintaz and Rapture.  Please make them “lure like” in resists to offset the high mana cost and extremely short duration.<P><BR>Equipment:<P>- It is clear that little is known about how the enchanter class operates.  We resemble other INT caster classes in appearance only, but in all other forms we are poor tanks wearing cloth armor.  Acknowledge the role we play, and create equipment that compensates for the frenzy we incur.  Flayed Skin armor is a good lower level  template for enchanter gear.  We need a choice of high AC / HP / Resist gear that is designed solely for the enchanters needs.<P>- Examine the effects placed on Velious enchanter gear.  Clarity on the leggings?  How is this useful, considering the level you will get these leggings?  Clarity 2 would be a much wiser choice.  The effect Rune IV on the robe is a novelty.  The horrendous casting time, and the fact that it eats a peridot makes it less than desirable.  Consider changing the affect to Rune V, or change the affect to Bedlam and lower the casting time to 12 seconds.  Also, re-evaluate the difficulty of the quests.  Currently the difficulty of the quests are much higher than zoning into PoG and looting the armor.  Balance out the difficulty and make the choice of “quest vs. kill” be a choice made on which one is more enjoyable, not which one is easier in the extreme.<P>General<P>-	Take time to re-evaluate the decision to make "clicky effects" have long casting times.  The explanation given by Verant for this was that it is "too hard" or "too embedded in the code to change".  Snicker.  Rewrite the "clicky effects" code to eliminate the need for horrendous casting times, and introduce recast times.  20 and 30 second casting times are unrealistic and are not useful.  Recast times would be much more balanced.<P>-	Examine the role of casters in high level dungeons and encounters in Velious.  The size of the mana pool has not changed, so having a caster over an additional meleer is a huge  hindrance.  Melee can do non stop damage as long as they draw breath.  Caster can dish out an embarrassingly small amount of damage, might as well change them out for a useful class in these encounters.<P>-	Consider removing the extreme resistance to Magic on uber mobs.  This was completely necessary on mobs like Cazic Thule or Nagafen, since then were limited to 32k hit points and a slow or a snare would be devastating.  This is no longer the case when the sky is the limit on mob hit points.  All it does now is alienate classes that have no other means of damage or debuffing.<P>-	Higher level Velious dungeons are “boring” at best for enchanters due to the extreme Magic resistance placed on these mobs.  Lower resistances to Magic in many Velious zones to stop the alienation of enchanters.<P>Epic quest<P>- What a beautiful quest. Extremely entertaining and very difficult.  Up until the point where you must kill Cazic Thule to get a Shissar Spirit to spawn.  Please re-evaluate the decision to require a 7 day spawn npc be slain.  There are huge numbers of enchanters who will be forever stuck on this part, with every other piece of the quest completed (and rotting in the bank) after months of effort.    We are fully aware that you wish to limit the number of these in the world, but it is not necessary.  Having a server full of enchanter epics is not the same, as say a server full of warrior epics.  The only thing the enchanter epic does it allow us to have more fun in the game instead of non-stop medding.  If we don’t cast Speed of Shissar, then we cast VoG.  Same difference, only that one allows us a pittance of entertainment, while the other dooms us to forever sit and med.  Yawn.  What we ask is that you make the distribution of these items based on FAIRENESS, not locale.  Many of us are cursed to never see a rare spawn alive due to our time zone.  Please consider changing this final step to a triggered spawn (such as Ixiblat Fer).<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Hi Absor,<P>I'm delighted to be able to give you my feedback on balancing Enchanters. I'm a long time Enchanter player, with two enchanters in the 50s. <P>First, enchanters are a popular class, regarded as almost essential in high level single group play. In looking at balancing the enchanter, their popularity suggests that they do not require signifigant work. Tweaking here and there could make the enchanter a more enjoyable balanced character at various levels however. Let me give you a breakdown of how I see things by level:<P><BR>Levels 1-15 (Infancy)<P>These are difficult levels for enchanters compared to most characters, but no tweaking is required. Enchanters accept this in part as a rite of passage. Our mana pool is too low to mes effectively at these levels. Our damage output is low. Our buffs and debuffs are not very useful. I repeat, I think we enchanters like this the way it is.<P><BR>Levels 16-28 (Childhood)<P>These are somewhat difficult, but not overly so, and no tweaking is required. The addition of breeze makes finding groups easier. We can use mes with some effectiveness now due to a larger mana pool. Level 24 is a big level, as we get a new bolt and a useful charm.<P><BR>Level 29-43 (Youth)<P>Augmentation and clarity at 29 allow us to easily secure our place in groups. Anarchy at 34 is an excellent (if high taunt) bolt. Our expanding mana pool makes messing a useful and regular part of our repetoir. One small negative thing happens here, mobs start to 'resist' memory blur, but that's not a big deal. Certainly no positive adjustment to enchanters is needed here, we are in our prime. Nerfing would not be unreasonable. A "good" nerf would be to make even+ conning mobs resist mesmerize and enthrall more, our two most mana efficient messes. <P>Level 44-50 (Adulthood)<P>More powerful buffs and debuffs, and an expanding mana pool, makes the enchanter a truly powerful force. We can mes with virtual impunity. Our level 44 bolt while high taunt is useful. Swift like the wind and shiftless deeds are powerful. Our charm at 49 is very useful. Certainly no positive adjustment in this period is necessary. Nerfing would not be unreasonable, and could be best expressed by making even+ mobs resist mes more.<P><BR>Level 51-60 (Dungeon Crawling)<P>The power of mobs in the higher level dungeons where we hunt makes them more of a challenge for us to deal with. This challenge is exciting, though we think wi****lly of lower level dungeons where we were (quite frankly) overpowered. Life is a little more boring as we need to be cautious given the power of mobs. Our bolts become almost useless but that isn't that big a deal really. No tweaking is necessary.<P><BR>Level 51-60 (Raids)<P>Our time is spent mainly buffing, and we provide valuable service in doing this. We mes mobs on occasion, but that is a rarity and not the norm. When facing powerful mobs, after we throw a tashania up, we're usually not that useful. Casting Rune on tanks can be valuable on occasion, and in encounters where we fulfill this role we do feel useful. For many encounters this isn't useful or necessary, and we are unable to affects the mobs due to high magic resistance.  We could use something useful to do during combat in these situations.<P>Enchanters do not stack well in raids. While having several enchanters is useful for "backup", most raids really only need one enchanter. It would be nice if when hunting in large groups, we were able to scale more effectively. Distributing buffing is really not that fulfilling, and doesn't make you feel valuable.<P><BR>Ideas worth exploring<P>- We need more to do at high levels against highly magic resistant mobs. Here are some comments:<BR>    - This is difficult to do without unbalancing us for single group situations.<BR>    - Suggestion 1: A pet similar to the cleric hammer pet. This would be a non magic based dot. Make it expensive so it's clear this is for situations where we can't otherwise use our mana effectively. Make its damage in line with pet classes at that level, because it's expensive, temporary, and we're not doing anything else. Don't make it look like our sword pet, that's confusing. Suggestion: make it look like the caster, that would be cool! Or, make it look like the mob, but with smaller size / different texture, so there isn't confusion.<BR>   - Suggestion 2: Our rampage line does not stack with other strength spells. It should. Most tanks want strength buffs all the time.<BR>   - Suggestion 3: Examine the resistance rates of mobs to mes at level 55+, especially in velious. <P><BR>- Enchanters need to be more useful in large raid situations where there are several enchanters:<BR>    - It is difficult to come up with useful ideas that would not overpower enchanters in the "single group" situation.<BR>    - The above pet idea would work nicely here, since extra enchanters would have something useful to do with their mana. <BR>    - Please keep this issue in mind when reviewing other's suggestions.<P>Small issues<P>- Illusions are not truly a balance issue, but for the happiness of enchanters, we'd appreciate some more variance here. They don't unbalance us either! <BR>- Some kind of visual feedback that a mob is messed would be nice<P>Thanks for your time in reviewing my suggestions!<P>Luna of Brell / Kitai of Tholuxe Paells<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Thank you for opening up the Enchanter Discussion Thread and I particularly thank you for making it possible to air some of the difficulties I see in the class I enjoy the most and to possibly have a say in making the class more fun and more balanced.<P>For your ease I am dividing my discussion into several areas to make it easier to read for you and to provide coherency.<P>ILLUSIONS<BR>First off, I would like to revisit the semantic question of whether our illusions are illusions or transformations.  I honestly believe your arguments to date have been extremely week and ask that you re-evaluate your choice in semantics.  Looking at Druids, Shaman and Necromancers and comparing the illusions they have to the Enchanter class leads me to believe that we all cast illusions.  Some of the classes DO NOT cast transformations and some cast illusions.  They are all one in the same and it would probably be more technically accurate to say we all cast transformations.  My argument is that as soon as you place one ability on ANY enchanter illusion you make it a transformation.  With that said I argue that a re-evaluation should be made to bring the illusions we do have in line with the effects that we garner.<P>Interestingly enough I do not understand why BOG and the Illusion: Werewolf spell do not have the same effects.  Personally I would like to see Werewolf for the enchanter changed to the effects in BOG.<P>I would like to see Illusions: Wolf changed such that it has the effect of the lowest level sow.  Yes I know this is not likely to happen, but it is consistent with how the transformations work, and no I don¡¦t see how it is class unbalancing at all.  Think about it.  The current effect wont let us turn into puppies indoors, so there is no reason that it should be limited.  If it had the effect of being cast indoors, then I could see no sow effect, but frankly the logic behind this spell makes no sense.<P>I highly doubt that any modifications will ever be made to the existing illusions, but I can¡¦t help but wish the effects given to the person behind the illusion would be consistent with the creature the caster is being transformed into.  As a last comment, I would really like to see that all changing of forms, whether cast by a shaman or druid or necromancer or enchanter be classified as an illusion OR transformation because they all give effects to the user.  Just settle on one term and don¡¦t try and use semantics that don¡¦t really mean squat in a fantasy setting.  <P>Last thought please make it so illusions can go across zones and only fall when the timer is finished.<P>MAGIC RESISTANCE AND TAUNTING<BR>The power of the Tashani line of spells is fantastic.  When grouping with all the casting types, that is and always has been, one of my first spells cast is tashani or tashania, to aid the group.  The friends I group with love that ability in my class and whenever they get a resist the first thing they ask is if I cast it or not.  Since our big damage spells are all based on Magic I propose an increase to the tashani line or a general decrease in mobs resist ability (mainly in Velious).  Is this balancing?  Maybe.  That is for you all to decide, but as it stands I have completely stopped going to Velious and remain in Kunark and Antonica.  To be very blunt, if I get 4 out of 5 resists, I don¡¦t plan on staying there.  To add a very negative effect when I do get resisted, I act as the ultimate puller and that warrior that was taunting now has to come get it off me regardless of whether my direct damage spell did anything to the mob or not, is totally unacceptable.  I suppose if the mob ignored my useless cast and left me alone I wouldn¡¦t be so upset, but I think every enchanter out there can tell you that when things like mezmerization and our other spells fail, fall or are resisted, we suddenly attract all attention to us and get whacked around real bad, dying quickly to mobs hitting for more damage that we can handle in too short of a time period.<P>I think this falls in nicely  with why I think our illusion: werewolf should be changed to the BOG way for us alone, because the added dex/agi (I forget which) makes it so we can refocus and cast to save our scrawny hides, ie by casting a mass stun or re-mez.<P>I would ask that not ALL our spells cause the mobs to instantly get angry at us.  I simply ask that if a resist occur they stay on the tank and not make a b-line for the enchanter and start whacking on him.  If the DD sticks then have him come over and beat on the enchanter ƒº<P>SPELLS<BR>Lull line = useless.  I learned long ago that this line was not worth the mana.  I don¡¦t use them and unless they change to more of a harmony effect I never will.  These spells need serious review.<P>Now being a creative enchanter I like to find out which spells do what and try to use good tactics.  So one day I was messing around and decided to see if any of my debuffing spells really had the effect they should.  Now we all know what happens when we are encumbered, right?  We slow way the heck down.  Well I figured that with the right combination I could slow any mob down, in effect snaring it.  So this was my lineup: Weakness, Incapacitate, Suffocate.  Str is reduced by 59, 49, 15 totaling ¡V123.  Hey that¡¦s not too bad!  Well guess what? That little ugly I just cast all that stuff on ran around rather quickly (ie no effect) and to make matters worse he was angry and beat me about for the same amount of damage!  Now if you ask me (assuming you did), that is not right.  He is incredibly weakened.  Assuming it is a warrior mob and he had max 255 str that means he 132 str out of that to smack me with.  If he doesn¡¦t slow down, then he should not be hitting me for the same amount of damage!  To verify I wasn¡¦t off my rocker I got my buddies to help me test this.  Ya know what?  Not a darn bit of damage reduction was observed!  Please fix this.<P>Is it possible to make our dots just a we bit faster?  In a group situation they aren¡¦t too effective because they are so slow.  Can you decrease the time it takes them for full effect?<P>The whirl line.  I still use whirl quite a bit.  I know others have said the spell sucks, but it is a good spell provided your bashing people in the group know you are using it.  It has saved my bacon more than once.  The problem I do have is with its big brother, Dyns.  That spell out and out sucks.  It is broken.  I do think that the bad thing about the spells is that if a bash occurs on the mob, the effect goes off.  For the amount of time the spell lasts, I don¡¦t think this should be the case.  I would rather see the whirl line converted into the color line to make a very long string of stun spells.  Just a thought.  But the end all is that Dyn¡¦s is broken and needs to be fixed.<P>SUMMATION<BR>In summary, make illusions have the effects they should, take care of our spells, make magic resistance much much less in velious, lower the darn agros of our spells!  I know you wanted class balance ideas and fixes.  I hope I provided what you wanted.  Keep in mind these are expressly my opinions and may or may not be shared by the enchanter community as a whole.  I am not post 50 so I cant talk about those issues but I can speak about everything up to 45th ƒº  Good day and thank you for reading my long post.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>When I think of balancing classes in EQ, I think Verant's goals should be the following:<P>1. Make every class contribute something valuable to groups<BR>2. Make every class an active contributor to their groups success<BR>3. Achieve goals 1 and 2 across all level ranges<P>When I think about my enchanter, I believe that for the most part, items 1 and 2 are achieved.  The only problem areas are at very low levels and at very high levels in high level encounters / zones in Velious.  Quite simply, Verant has chosen to make the majority of 50+ mobs in Velious some combination of unmezzable, unstunnable, uncharmable, magic resistant, or magic immune.  When I look at the options left to me as an enchanter in Velious and in most boss mob encounters, I do 4 things: group resist magic, speed, c 2, and occasionally gift (although the value of doing this is questionable).   Every 20 minutes I can do something useful.<P>Am I still valuable to the group?  <P>Yes.<P>Am I an active contributor to the success of my group?  <P>No.  I can play a twink tank or cleric on my other account, put my chanter on auto-follow, and speed click, C 2, and grm every 20 minutes.  What is worse, I can do this for a raid of 36 with one enchanter with an epic.  <P>The most critical problem with Chanters, and a few other classes post 50, is that they are no longer fun.  The biggest cause of this problem is that with Velious and high level mobs have insane MR and anti-crowd control flags basically invalidate core class abilities.  Enchanters are not alone in this, but they are the most profoundly affected because EVERY enchanter offensive spell is magic based.  <P>What do enchanters need to be balanced?<P>Below 50, I am not sure there is a huge justification for anything to balance a chanter.  Perhaps in the early days before level 16 and Breeze, something should be done to make it a little easier to survive, level, and get groups.  Getting to 29th level as an enchanter (pre-Breeze) was so difficult I almost gave up twice.  Level 7 and 13 took me two weeks apiece and I lost 8th level more times than I wish to count.  Granted, I did not know my class, but I suspect I would still find those levels difficult because of the lack of power in the class at those levels.  Perhaps some level limited Color Shift spells at 8th (level 20 limit) and 24th (level 39 limit)?  Perma stun ( chain casting ae stuns to keep mobs from doing anything ) is a technique that only becomes viable at 44.  Adding this series would drop it down to where it became somewhat viable at 8 and again more viable at 20th.  Lower mana pools, lower skills, and lower stun times would still make this risky in the extreme for a low level chanter.<P>After 50 and in the large raid world, Enchanters need something that allows them to play an active role in the battle.  They need a compelling reason to be at the keyboard, paying attention to the action in hopes of turning the tide, saving someone's arse, etc. with a crucially timed cast or action.<P>What could be done to give chanters a role?<P>1.  Sharply reduce or eliminate aggro on Tashan line and increase magic debuff.  This would allow chanters to debuff sufficiently to allow magic spells to stick more frequently on all but totally magic immune creatures.  Right now, tash = death.  A common question before the main attack is "Which chanter gets to die from tashing this time?"  It would be a start, because it would open up more possiblities for familiar tactics to be used, but that nullifies the point of the challenges created for Velious.  Fine, you don't want me to screw with the mobs abilities, let me mess with my group's abilities.  Personally, I'm not sure I like this one.  I do not mind not being able to mez mobs if I have some active role I can play in the battle.<P>2.  Give chanters a series of short duration, long recast time spells that have great opportunity to affect the course of the battle.  A couple existing spells could be tweaked to help with this or some other spells could be created.  Some possibilities:<BR>a.  Make Memory Flux work much more often.  I could save tanks, clerics, etc. in my group if Flux actually made a mob forget the players they decided to hate more than 10% of the time.<BR>b.  Improve Boon of the Garou so that the stacking issues are resolved ( it does not stack with several other spells, most notably, I believe the new ranger buff) and remove the motion effects - it gives some people motion sickness when it is cast on them.<BR>c.  Give me a targetable Jolt/Blur that allows me to save a member of my group (group only spell) from taking a severe beating.<BR>d.  Give me a spell that resets the target's discipline timer to 15 to 30 seconds.  Give it a long recast time and/or expensive / infrequently dropped reagent.<BR>e.  Give me a spell that allows me to increase another casters mana supply in infrequent, high impact  bursts.  Harvest for others.<BR>f.  Give me a pet only magic resistance buff that allows all pet classes to use their pets in a fight against fearing uber mobs. ( should be far superior to the player versions to account for lower pet levels. )<BR>g.  Make Lull line of spells work well enough that casting them actually helps seperate mobs in a pull.<BR>h.  Give me a rune upgrade that absorbs hits rather than damage.  Mobs that hit for 850 laugh at rune V.<BR>i.  Give me a targetable pet, that allows my Warrior to get a stupid enchanter pet and have it aggro when HE gets hit. (Limit one per customer, as always)  Call it Gift of Kintaz.  Have the pet suicide after a fixed duration of time.<BR>j.  Give me a targetable Illusion: Air Elemental that causes the target to proc Color Flux.  Duration and recast times same as Boon of the Garou. <BR>k.  Give me a targetable Illusion: Earth Elemental that causes the target to proc Root and gives the target a large strength boost.  Duration and recast times same as Boon of the Garou.<BR>l.  Give me a targetable Illusion: Water Elemental that causes the target to proc Memory Flux, Tashania, or Evade.  Duration and recast times same as Boon of the Garou.<BR>m.  Give me a targetable Illusion: Fire Elemental that causes the target to gain a damage shield and proc Feedback.  Duration and recast times same as Boon of the Garou.<BR>n.  Give me a targetable Illusion: Skeleton that causes the target to proc a short duration Fear.  Duration and recast times same as Boon of the Garou.<BR>o.  Give me a targetable Buff that causes a PC to proc Theft of Thought, a baby version of theft of thought, or a Mana sieve.  Duration and recast times same as Boon of the Garou.<BR>p.  Give me a targetable buff that causes a PC to proc Cripple.  Duration and recast times same as Boon of the Garou.<BR>q.  Give me a targetable buff that causes a PC to proc Bedlam.  Duration and recast times same as Boon of the Garou.<P>One note: j, k, m, n, and p are unlikely to stick the same way that chanter magic based spells are unlikely to stick.  The difference is that when the resisted spell aggro's something, it aggro's on a PC capable of taking the hits.  In effect, I am grafting a spell onto someone instead of casting it myself.      If a spell resists 3 of 4 procs like they would if I cast em, I don;t die in 3 hits to a mob that quads for 850. (Can you say Velketor?)  It will be a nice bonus when it does stick.  Still, I prefer other suggestions more.<P>How is that balanced?  <P>Simple.  A long recast time means the use of another different, unmemmed spell while a spell is rechargining is impossible.  In the end game, traditional spell choices go out the window because they are ineffective.  What are they replaced by now?  Nothing.  That is the whole problem.  If you are going to fine tune the end game, the capabilities have to be high impact, infrequently available tactics with sufficient duration to be viable in a high end encounter.  For casters, that means spells with long recast times, for tanks that means disciplines, for hybrids that means some balance of spells and disciplines.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Let me chuck up most of an e-mail I sent you with some of the issues...<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<P>First, my basic views on enchanters:<BR>Enchanters are one of the most powerful classes in the game.  Flat out.  The more people you group us with, the more powerful we are.  Give us a party of 6 and unless they are all necro's, we'll add significantly to the party.  Mez itself doesn't make this so.  Nor does slow.  Just clarity and haste make it so.  Haste will increase the power of a melee class by 25 to 50%.  Clarity will do the same for casting classes.  Inspite of that, we have our drawbacks and merged together, this has formed a class that is balanced and due to our downtime reducing properties basically become viewed as a must have by most dungeon groups.  Downtime isn't fun and the best way to reduce downtime is the enchanter.  Any changes therefore, need to take into account that the enchanter is already an extremely powerful class.<BR> <BR>My view on the types of enchanters:<BR>I generally see 4 types of enchanters.<BR> <BR>1. Control.  These are the guys that can stop a 10 mob pull single handedly (well, with heals from the cleric, of course).  They are the ones responsible for the enchanters godlike image.  These people like to be active.  To contribute.<BR> <BR>2. Illusionists.  More roleplay/fun loving types.  These guys like to go to different forms.  Typically faction buffs as well.<BR> <BR>3. Enchanters.  They were told they could make enchanted weapons and they liked this idea.  The tradeskill people.<BR> <BR>4. Debuffers.  Looking at the enchanter spell line up, it would appear that the enchanter has the power to debuff a mob greatly.  Most of these have either quit playing or shifted to control types.<BR> <BR>Now let's take a look at SoV, from the perspective of each of these groups:<BR> <BR>Control: High MR to 100% MR on mobs have reduced the enchanters to just buffing in many zones.  Buffing is a passive activity.  To these people, this represents a massive shift in the focus of the class.  From active to the most passive of all.  Your comment on necro mana feeding and clerics basically deals with this.  Enchanters still contribute for the party.  However, like necro's, what was once an active class with visible, noticable impact on battles is now a passive class that relies upon others to do the work.  It doesn't come close to a clerics, who has to juggle the casting time of the heal, the mana cost, and amount healed while trying to keep everyone in the party alive.  Just buffing is boring.<BR> <BR>The illusionists.  Other classes get illusions.  Enchanters don't.  They aren't very happy about this.<BR> <BR>The enchanters.  Still can't enchant, although boon of garou at least lets them add procs to people.  Nice spell.<BR> <BR>Debuffers.  There really aren't many of these left.  Stat debuffs don't make a difference, aside from acting as a quasi snare on some mobs.  The high level mobs with high MR are too risky for an enchanter to slow.  We don't have the HP or AC to survive a resist.  And forlorn deeds has too long of a casting time to cast through getting pounded.<BR> <BR>Now, the challenge is this... how to fix the class without upsetting the power balance.  Yes, the class is broken.  From a power balance perspective, the class is balanced.  But from a fun standpoint, it isn't.  High MR zones in SoV broke the class.<BR> <BR>So... how to fix the class...<BR> <BR>From the control view:<BR> <BR>The class needs something active to contribute.  A token fire spell might work, but too many mobs are resistant to that.  A lure type magic spell might help, but that's a wizard thing and doesn't help at all against 100% MR things.  Lowering the resists in zones where it is all out of whack.  A great solution, but one that would require a lot of work, in short, not likely to happen.  None of these are optimal in my view.  What I would recommend instead is the addition of 2 spells:<BR> <BR>Glamour of &lt;some anagram here&gt;: this spell would have the duration and casting cost of glamour of kintaz.  It would only work on critters level 55 and below.  But it works on giant flag critters.  This would enable enchanters to crowd control somewhat against giant type mobs, but at a high mana cost.<BR> <BR>Absor's Animation: (okay, they'll scramble the name, but that's how all our pets are named).  This would be a level 55 spell.  It would cost as much as our 55 pet and take two tiny daggers to cast.  It works like the clerical/mage pets.  It summons a dual wielding pet (preferably with a haste spell already on it) that attacks the current target until that target dies.  This pet will have 2x the hp of the 55 pet spell.  This will allow it to survive a hit or two from the big nasty boss mobs.  This was basically the original intent of how enchanter pets were supposed to work.  Against 100% MR mobs, enchanters could contribute damage without the hassles of getting hit first.  Another alternative for this pet is one that dies when the target does, very little offense but very high hp and mega taunt... you cast it on a mob and it keeps it occupied for a while.  The only big drawback is that against zones where everything is MR, that's a lot of casting and tiny daggers to go through.  Perhaps only one tiny dagger per casting or a chance of taking one tiny dagger, but you must have one?<BR> <BR>What this accomplishes:<BR>Expands crowd control to a few more zones in SoV and gives enchanters something somewhat active to do against MR mobs.  I don't think it's enough, but it's something.<BR> <BR>From the Illusionist point of view:<BR> <BR>I don't think new textures should be added to the global file for enchanter illusions.  This space could be better spent to add a cloth texture set or 3, in my opinion, something to let us wear something besides dresses or plain leather.  So that leaves us with just the current textures.<BR> <BR>Bear and Lich form are out.  That's fine, unique to those classes, I can live with that.  However, we need some turnabout there.  Werewolf is our class defining form.  We have it, nobody else should, unless we cast it on them. There is a bard only lute with illusion werewolf, Lute of the Howler.  It needs to no longer drop.  Let those that already exist continue to do so.  But it needs to be gone from the drop tables.  There is also an item that supposedly drops in MistMoore, the werewolf skin.  It is a 30 ac, bard/warrior bp that can cast werewolf.  I believe it is a hoax, but if it exists, it too needs to be removed from the drop tables.<BR> <BR>In addition, a few fixes need to be made.  Illusion spirit wolf used to be castable inside.  This was nerfed to outside only because wolf elementals were on beta-nuetral faction and this made corpse recovery on dragon raids too easy.  Wolf elementals are no longer on beta-nuetral faction.  As such, the reason for the nerf is gone and the nerf should be undone.  Second, and far more important, lichform and bear form both need their factions adjusted.  Right now, they can be cast anywhere to get non-KoS status.  The enchanter equivs (or druid/ranger wolfform) result in being KoS in those same areas.  An evil shaman casting bear form in PoG is no longer KoS.  This is a bug and needs fixing.<BR> <BR>What does that leave us left with for new illusions?  A few textures that aren't used like Eye of Zomm.  But it's kind of hard to think of anything cool and useful to go with that.  Illusion gender would rock and I believe you'll add it when you get it working right.  But it shouldn't be a 44+ illusion.  Illusion target or random would also be nice, but that has code issues and, being a random critter, wouldn't be good for much more than a look.  Again, not really worth of being a 50+ illusion.  What I would recommend is the elemental line.  It has 4 spells that could all be useful but balanced group spells.  Factions aren't an issue as about anywhere elementals gain you a benefit, skeleton form or werewolf gets you the same benefit.  These are available via the amulet of necropotence and boon of the garou.<BR> <BR>51: Group Earth Elemental: adds +10 str.  A minor benefit.  Any large races lose slam.<BR> <BR>54: Group Water Elemental: Gives undering breath.  It's a utility spell.  Saves a fish scale.  Downside is it doesn't cross zone-lines and doesn't last through link-death.  Cool looking form though.<BR> <BR>57: Group Air Elemental: gives levitate.  Again, a utility spell.  It saves a few batwings, very useful for travelling or in areas with slippery ice covered surfaces.<BR> <BR>60: Group Fire Elemental: this one is the only one with balance issues.  Fire elemental starts at 9 points at 34 but increases to 15 by 59.  It stacks with other damage shields.  For balance reasons, I would set the damage equal to -51 + players level.  So a 51 player gets a 1 point shield and a 60 gets a 9 point shield.  This is assuming it works like the single target fire elemental and stacks.  If it doesn't stack, then the amount could be set to 11 (same as the enchanter level 29 feedback spell).  Personally, I like the stacking version.<BR> <BR>What this accomplishes:<BR>Restores the validity of the unique argument by ensuring that enchanters have their unique look.  Adds 4 illusions post 50 adding validity to the enchanter illusionist title.  Fixes a few bugs to ensure that from a faction standpoint, the enchanter illusions are the best or at least equal.  Undoes one of the many incidental nerfs enchanters have suffered over the years as the reason it was done no longer exists (and also provides a nice argument to counter the give it SoW requests=) ).<BR> <BR>From the Enchanters point of view:<BR> <BR>Personally one I don't really care too much about.  I tinker not enchant.  However, I think cultural smithing provides much of the answer here.  Simply put, the addition of religion based weapon mixtures for smithing.  These recipes would require an imbued gem (stops enchanter monopoly), mana vial of some sort (use for these spells and enchanters are enchanting) and enchanted metal (more enchanter stuff).  In addition, the recipes would require a drop from somewhere, like a short sword of ykesha (aka yak, an 8/24 1h slash with a 75 point DD proc).  This accomplishes two things... it limits the number of items entering the world and provides a way to give the weapons some real power.  An item that takes a yak for the prime healer, for instance, could result in an 8/24 weapon with a procs that is an 80 point heal on the weilder.  Depending on how cruel you wish to be, you could make the failure of an attempt eat the weapon required in the making or return it.  This will leave the agnostics feeling a bit short, so a few religion-free race recipes could also be introduced.  However, I like the idea of items that proc heal for the prime healer, ones that proc disease dot's for Bertox, a weapon that only procs indoors for Brell, etc.  Adds some nice flavor to things.  Most of these changes are long term, of course.<BR> <BR>What this accomplishes:<BR>Gives Yak much more work in other areas when he should be focusing on tinkering.  But seriously, a way that enchanters are involved in the making of enchanted weapons without giving them such a foot hold that they dominate it like jewelry.  Enchanters really are the best class to do just about any tradeskill with so precautions must be taken in this regard.  (Try and find another class that can boost str by 80, int/wis by 20, has the cha and faction of enchanters, and can boost dex by 100).<BR> <BR>From the Debuffers point of view:<BR> <BR>Not really much to be done here.  Stats don't mean anything and that's the way it'll stay.  If they ever do start meaning something, then this will mean something.  However, against anything MR, nothing to be done here.  Slow is the only debuff that matters and against the tougher mobs (read non-xp group areas), only shamans have the hp's, ac, and casting times to slow them reliably.  And we're fine with that.  An unresistable minor slow could be added, but slow has become the class defining ability of the shaman.  An unresistable str/agil debuff could be added to enchanters, but, well, that means nothing.  One interesting idea here would be sort of an offensive cleanse we could cast on mobs.  Cleanse is a proc for a cleric/paladin weapon that removes all negative effects on the weilder.  A dispel that removes all positive magic effects on the target but leaves the negative (like slows and dot's) would be cool and fit the enchanter as master of enchantments.  However, such a thing might upset clerics as the main thing we want gone is damage shields and mark of karn does that.  This would pretty much be an unneeded bonus, but would be a cool spell regardless.  Clerics and paladins could be given a cleanse type spell to cast on people at the same time maybe.  *shrug*<BR> <BR>Now let's talk about Gear:<BR> <BR>Afraid I'm going to get a bit passionate here.  I've always been sorely disappointed in Verant having no clue as to what casters are looking for in gear.<BR> <BR>Who designs this crap?  We get jack and most of it isn't any better than what we've been wearing since hate opened.  The only piece of the new enchanter only armor that is clearly better than the planar is the robe.  The sleeves, legs, and gloves are close to planar.  The bracers just provide more int we don't want or need.  The head slot and boots are worse.  And that's saying something, as hate plane enchanter boots suck, especially compared to loam encrusted.  Enchanters have a 20 point int buff.  They have a 50 point cha buff.  Int gear is out there everywhere.  And many items that give us other things we want also give us int.  Enough with the int.  We don't want it.  Bad enough the Staff of the Serpent got nerfed and had 5 points of stamina moved into int.  Additionally, the AC... we'd like some please.  Kunark upped how hard mobs hit by 20/30 points in the upper levels.  SoV added another 20/30 to that.  After 2 expansions, we've gotten a new armor set.  For the most part, the ac on a piece is 1 higher, say about 7 points total.  Tanks, in the same time frame, have gotten that much of an increase on a single piece of armor.  Added to that, int casters get AC on character at a rate of 5:6.  A piece of gear with 5 AC gives us 6 when worn.  Any non-int caster gets it at a rate of 5:8.  This means that from a gear perspective, we've gained the total benefit from replacing a whole set (which we won't do because the stats on most of the pieces are not an improvement) as any other class gets from replacing a single piece of gear.  Int casters are supposed to be more fragile.  But if you crank up how hard the mobs hit and up how often we have to cast on the mobs to have the same effect (higher hp, higher resists), we need a way to survive it.  And that means AC and HP gear.  Take the SoV robes for instance.  12 ac.  Up from 11 on the insidious robe.  1 point.  With the 5:6 ratio, this just doesn't cut it.  There's no way we can compete with tanks, there is no way we can become tank mages.  We don't have the defensive skills to do so.  That robe should have an AC of 14 or 15.  As the set is right now, we're better off with going mostly insidious (except for the robe) and then using a slot like belt for a high ac belt.  We'll get more AC and better stats.  Each piece should have it's AC upped by 1 and the robe and pants by 2.  It's not enough, but it's something.<BR> <BR>The effects?  Clerics get their level 59 heal spell and CH as well as group heals, spells they'll use.  Necro's get summon corpse that uses the stackable corpses.  Great stuff.  Useful stuff.  So what do enchanters get?  <BR> <BR>Reclaim energy on the bracers.  We aren't a pet class, you've told us that time and time again.  Most enchanters just use invis to kill their pet.  We really aren't worried about mana reclaimed from the pet.  We rarely use our pet, and when we do, mobs get rid of it for us.  This is no good.  It needs replacing with something useful.  For instance, enthrall (or entrance, but duration on entrance would require a longer casting time), as long as the casting time was around 7-8 seconds.  People will complain that they can get that much mana back just medding and about how it would be useless due to mez stacking issues (enchanters use dazzle or entrance, mostly and different mez spells don't override each other), but I think it would be pretty useful.  Another pretty useful spell would be resist magic.  This would be helpful mainly for raids, as you'll use group resist magic on your own group.  If it had a 4 or so second casting time, it would be quite useful on raids.  A spell from outside our class, preferably a fire based DD would be nice, even if it was for 120 or so damage.  It would allow us to get around our MR problems somewhat.  The level 34 mana theft DoT would have been an interesting choice as well.  But reclaim energy shows that someone with no clue about the enchanter class designed the armor.<BR> <BR>Invis on the boots.  No problem with this.  Quite useful, especially for releasing charmed pets.  This one is well done.  Everything else about the boots suck.  But the spell is nice.<BR> <BR>Rune IV.  Not Rune III with it's jasper.  Not Rune V with it's 300 poins more skin.  No, Rune IV with a need of a peridot and a 28 second casting time.  If it was Rune III with about a 15 second casting time, that would be fine.  That's about a 300 point heal every 15 seconds.  Not bad.  Doesn't compare to celestial elixir or CH, but usuable somewhat in combat.  Rune V would have been nice.  This is a spell we use.  It's 700 points of skin.  Rune IV just isn't.  When we need rune, we need 700 points of it.  When we NEED we need the best.  When we don't, we aren't going to waste the money on this... especially when we get mana the way we do.  It really should be bumped up to Rune V or else replaced with Bedlam at a 15 second cast.<BR> <BR>I think that having people design for classes they don't play has its merits... but it is very vital to get input from those that do play the classes.  At the very least, check out Castersrealm's player lists and see what the high end enchanters on it are wearing.  That will show what we value and provide some insight in what we need and what we'll use.<BR> <BR>Lastly, robe looks.  Mainly, Ishva, Robe of the Elements, and the new one from SoV that looks like the blighted robe.  Retint all 3 to a different color.  Planar robes are a status symbol.  Giving the exact look to non-planar robes is an insult.<BR> <BR>Conclusion:<BR> <BR>Myself, I'm a crowd controller.  I need crowds to control.  There are camps I don't go to simply because they are boring to me.  Guardian in sebilis, for instance.  The pulls aren't big enough to provide me any excitement and this pretty much leaves me with just buffing, no need to go jumping over people to be able to get the right mob targetted, no quick stuns to buy the cleric healing time, no rush, no fun.  I'm an enchanter and a damn good one.  And yet in much of SoV, I play my warrior.  Simply because all you need is 1 enchanter to buff everyone.  And I pity that guy, because he's bored as hell.  Why the warrior?  Because if you get an additional mob, you have a warrior tank it.  Yup, that's right, warriors are now crowd control.  I can accept zones where I can't mez.  I think it's nice to mix things up.  But I can't accept lots of zones where I can't mez or cast any of my offensive spells (although, even when I can, like Kael, I don't bother.  Our DoT's don't stack with superior necro ones or another enchanters, our DD's are too high taunt, too long recast, too low damage, too resisted... all we're really good for is buffs and crowd control).  I can't accept zone after zone where I can't crowd control, where it is more effective to just tank the additional mob.  Zones where all I can do is buff.  Don't go comparing it to clerics.  They matter.  The spells they cast mid-fight and the choices they make of what spell to cast can decide victory or loss.  They can watch their mana bar drop and the red health bars rise.  Buffing every 24 minutes (haste for tanks) and 32 minutes (clarity for casters) doesn't compare.  It's boring and something needs to be done.  We need something active, something fun and useful mid fight.  You've got some of the best quitting after 60 levels... you've got some of the best that won't play their enchanters in much of SoV.  Something is wrong.<BR> <BR>I honestly don't know what the answers are that'll fix everything and make it all okay.  All I know is that SoV broke what was one of the most fun and well designed classes in EQ.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<P>On Gift of Brilliance:<P>The first thing you may wish to do is verify that that is what the spell actually does.  I'm inclined to believe that it works with specializiation, not +mana per tick or +mana.  Could be wrong, but that's just my view.<P>Illusions dropping while zoning is fine.  There is almost always a safe place to put them back up.  I'd rather have it drop on zoning (a known thing) then to risk gating in illusion form into a hostile reception because of my current form.<P>Another issue:<BR>Umbra vs shadow.  Umbra is the 57 enchanter AC buff.  Shadow is the 49 one.  Umbra costs more.  Umbra has a slightly longer duration.  Umbra does not give more AC.  When comparing the increased cost to the duration, Umbra is more mana ineffecient to cast.  This spell could use some adjustment.<P>However, the only issue that significantly ruins my fun is SoV.  The level of resists in the 50+ zones is insane.  100% MR, things that can't be mez'd.  Mixing it up in zones is one thing.  But making whole zones that are designed to reduce enchanters to just buffing, nuts.<P>Right now, I pretty much refuse to play my enchanter in high level SoV zones.  And I'm not the only enchanter with this view.  It's a game, games are meant to be fun.  And just buffing isn't fun.<P>Axterix En'Obelix<BR>Level 59 enchanter<BR>The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ah hah! You DID mention Illusions, Absor- Since I don't do much Velious hopping (and can't comment on the mes sitaution there) I will chat about illusions!<BR>/cheer<P>Illusions:<BR>At level 51 Enc's class title gets replaced with "Illusionist"… yet, aside from having NO 50+ illusions, we only have one (1) spell that makes us look like no other class can look like. Yes, Minor Illusions is the only way an "illusionist" can look unique… I can be a chair (and thanks to the recent patch or root/snare stacking I can't even be a moving chair anymore)… Nope, No other class can look like a chair.<P>Sadly, Minor Illusions isn't what it used to be; not only was the movement component removed, but the size was limited. I used to be able to be darn near anything (from the large rocks outside of Neriak to the Gates of Felwithe themselves) but now I'm limited to be a small desk or lamp or something equally less exciting.<P>Because of this, the spell is rarely used if at all.<P>What do we have left?<BR>Racial Illusions? Not very exciting…<BR>Elementals? Potions can make anyone an elemental…<BR>Skeleton/Drybone? Necro's do it too…<BR>Wolf? Druids/Rangers…<BR>Werewolf? Bards get even this…<P>That leaves Enc with no uniuqe illusions aside from small inanimate objects, yet two classes now have unique "transformation" spells, and a 3rd class can summon near-any type of zone dependant mob in the game.<P>Why should a class titled "Illusionist" be limited and even surpassed in appearing to be something else?<P>I'm not asking for spectre and bear form, leave those unique to their classes since that seems to be the general consensus at Verant, but give Enc some sort of new illusions that are in-line with their class title.<P>I don't care much for them to be largely effective in helping us get around places, as ease of movement through illusions is something Verant obviously doesn't want (even with warmly faction with Sarnaks the "leader" in the fort is still kos.) What I do want is to be able to do what I used to be able to do, amaze people when I was a large rock pretending to block the entrance to Nektulos, or a tower in misty that was sitting on top of a large stump. Or running around as something unique (werewolf is still pretty unique, but in all honesty it is aged - heh, which sadly will happen to most illusions probably.)<P>There are limitations to the global file of course; but this can be overcome through zone speicific illusions and other "neat" illusions.<P>Illusion: Gender or Illusion: Male and Illusion: Female (Stacks w/ other illusions)<BR>Illusion: Small/Big (Will be self-only so shouldn't infringe on shaman- Stacks w/ Other Illusions)<BR>Illusion: Monster (Zone specific Illusion of a random mob - Faction probably an issue here… how about making us insta-kos? That should be easier to code than individual faction for each possible illusion)<BR>Major Illusion (Upgrade to Minor Illusions, basically removing the size limit and adding the ability to move- Stacks w/ Other Illusions)<BR>Illusion: Plate/Leather/Chain/[other clothing styles and colors] (is this possible? It's just a quick idea =D would also stack)<BR>Illusion: Face (Changes your face- would stack as well)<P>I don't think any of these spells would be terribly hard to put in (though the zone illusion could be tough.)<BR>Basically most of these illusions are presumably easily implemented, as they are, for the most part in the game already.<P>When I first started my Enc I did it so that my friends and I would have a way to make magical weapons while we were out adventuring =P<P>But then I discovered Minor Illusion and fell in love with the class…<P>Illusions are what make Illusionists, Illusionists… and right now we're less unique than 3 other classes in the "looking like something else" department =/<P>I know this isn't a burning balance issue, or something that Enc "need" to survive… but it's a fun spell, and back when Abashi was PR manager guy he said fun spells would seriously be considered-<P>Well? Consider away my friends!<P>(note, another fun spell : Voice Graft- we've had a voice graft thread get to part two and then shut down (with no part 3, mind you) and are still waiting for even a HINT of a response, yet we get nothing…<BR>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/040662.html<BR>)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Enchanter Concerns<P>1) Do something with Lull Line (make it non – aggro to make it more worthwhile to cast instead of suicide to cast at higher levels)<P>2) Illusions are still somewhat bugged as a gnome who can turn into an Iksar; many people ask me how I got to be a tiny Iksar.  Illusions staying up with LD and zoning would be nice.<P>3) Whirl till you Hurl and Dyns Dizzying Draught are relatively worthless. Please do something to fix or add some additional ability.  These spells are never used.<P>4) The strength debuffs are worthless in non PvP situations, maybe add an added effect Vs Mobs.<P>5) Curse of the Simple Mind.  Only the Simple minded use this spell.<P>6) Have higher level mezzes overwrite lower level mezzes.<P>7) If a target is Immune to a spell such as Dazzle, let us know before the spell goes off similar to Theft of Thought/Banish Undead.  So many of the Mobs in Velious are not Giants but are immune to Mezz, give us some help here and at least not make us die solely to an opponent who is totally immune to one of our main lines.<P>8) Enchanter Robe with Rune IV is useless with a reagent and that casting time. Drop the reagent, lower the casting time, or raise it to Rune V.  Other enchanter gear could use an upgrade the things that we care about are some AC/HP/Resist options.  Many of the items that would be nice all have a negative charisma as a drawback, which still leaves these items open for the other 3 int based casters.<P>9) A message for when Charm is successful and when it breaks.  This could fix some of the bugs that you get when you charm something and it continues to attack one of your party members.  Changing the Text color over the charmed mob might also help.<P>10) Mezzed mobs that are about to break mez (2 seconds away) that get stunned for 8 seconds immediately start attacking, does breaking mez break all stun effects?<P>11) Most of our dots last too long to be useful, not sure what can be done about this since they are almost never used.<P>12) Component on Rune IV is too expensive.  Downgrade it to a 5 pp gem or something in that area.<P>13) Buffing is made tedious by the short duration of Enchanter buffs, how about increasing the duration of C2, since its level capped this would not make it that abuseable.<P>14) When something is Immune to Stun (Giants etc.) have it give us a message.<P>15) Visions of Grandeur recast time is too long.  15 secs?<P>16) Give us a failure message on Memblurs.<P>17) Umbra apparently has the same effect as shadow AC wise.<P>18) Remove the 15 buff limit!<P>19) I would love to see some new illusions!<P>20) Do something with the mana series.<P>21) Not for enchanter discussion but Fix Tinkering, add more items!<P>22) Make the head of the Shissar for Enchanter Epic quest spawn somewhat randomly too in Plane of Fear.  7 days is too long to wait Give it a somewhat random chance to spawn at other times.<P>23) The gift series is underpowered please add some other effect to make it more worthwhile.<P><BR>Beralt Mindtwister Unity</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Two comments overflow significantly onto other classes, so bear emphasis:<P>The Lull line is practically useless for both enchanters and clerics.  Resist rates are extremely high.  No one in their right mind would rely on these spells for a safe pull.<P>Stat debuffs on mobs do nothing but taunt the mob onto the enchanter or shaman.  A mob double hits for 130; after being hit with Cripple it double hits for 130.  These spells are even less useful than buffs are on melee.  <P>Both these issues affect not individual spells but *spell lines*.  Depending on either to give you an edge wastes mana and risks your life and that of your group.<P>Lots of other issues come to mind, but I have no doubt they'll be covered 20 or 30 times in the next 15 minutes.

</FONT><HR>Enchanters quite simply rock. They got their flaws (very vulnerable in bad groups), and are replaceable by bard/necro combo.<P>I do think more illusions should be available to enchanters, especially a few have been added lately to other classes, and none to enchanters since level 44.  Illusion: gender would be great.. particularly if it's stackable with all the other illusion spells MUAHAHAHAH.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  No balance issue, whether you look male or female doesn't matter at all...<P>Useless spells:<P>Lull line (pacify/soothe). Also used by clerics and paladins. Entirely useless. An enchanter is better of mezzing one mob and having the others come to him/her.  I know this is unlikely to ever change... just remove this line entirely from enchanters. (Paladins can actually use this spell occasionally, since they are meant to take damage)<P>Whirl til you hurl and Dyn's Dizzying Draught.  High resist combined with it breaking fast (supposedly a bash/slam/stun from anyone else will instantly break it) makes it unfeasible to use.  It also has a slow casting time. If I want to interrupt anything, I use my color line of spells or mez, yes, mez.<P>My personal knowledge stops at 38.  But from my other char's experience, and what other enchanters have said, the power of enchanters only increases.  <P>Another note. THE HOLE.  Mobs in there should never be more than 53.  Due to being in old Kunark, the cap there on all mez spells is so that no mob higher than that can be mezzed. But the designers put regular mobs into the hole that go up to a higher level (aka 52-54). Please change that.

</FONT><HR>Enchanters roll have become Buff Whores in Velious. Their Mesmerize line is uselss, 90% of the zones that you go into you find out that a very very HIGH majority of the creatures in there are 100% immune to being mesmerized.<P><BR>Enchanters have been stripped of their usefulness. We are there to C2 people, and QQQQ people. You've eliminated a full line of spells for enchanters for big raids.<P>Not even with a Tashanian and a Malo a mesmerize will go through. Verant has destroyed the usefullness of enchanters and all 4 major casting classes in the new expansion.

</FONT><HR>As a lvl 60 enchanter I agree with all Mezzmo says above. All I have to say extra is that as the game progresses Verant seems to make more and more mobs very high Magic Resistance(especially in Velious), such that even after tashing a mob we can not get any of our spells to "stick" on a mob.By doing this you basically make enchanters nothing more then a buffer.  I suggest either re-evaluating the MR of mobs, adding a new lvl 60 tash spell that has a Larger effect on MR, or giving us a few useful spells that dont save vs magic on the monsters when we cast. It used to be that only UBER mobs we were useless but now it is getting to where common zone mobs we cant even help on. I dread the next week when we begin doing the Hall of Test in Temple of Veshaan as a guild because all I will get to do is sit and buff people.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Many, many good ideas here.  The one that I reall agree with is the resistance of the Uber mobs.  I saw a quote earlier in this thread about it not being a resistance, rather an exclusion of class A, B, etc..  This is absolutely true.  Every class has a specific job in a group.  If you make a mob unmezzable or unsnarable, you have completely removed a class from the encounter.  A higher level quest mez spell or a component requiring mez spell would be one way to make this harder.  But to completely take away the main strength of an Enchanter in the encounter, does not make sense.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>      Just a couple suggestions.. Since you are now allowing Werewolf Illusions to be cast on others it might be time to allow all (or at least the humanoid) chanter illusions to work on non- chanters (obviously they must be in your party)<BR>     Gift of Brilliance would be improved if it provided Clarity II as well.. Would save a buff slot which is big since there are so many buffs now. Gift of Insight could be knocked down to 50 and provide Clarity..  (We dont need another int/wis buff keep the extra mana part of it). <BR>     How about an uber expensive 20 second Mezz which will work on any mob less than level 60.. Yeah I know about Rapture but it doesnt work on every mob and has a 20 second refresh time.<BR>Maybe it could cost 700 mana like dictate.. <BR>      Speaking of Dictate could you change the 48 seconds to 60? <BR>      Can you fix Shissar so call of the Earth doesnt override it?<BR>      I know its sort of necroish but how bout a ManaDot we can cast on someone to refresh their mana supply (Maybe it would cost like 500 but add 200 mana over 30 seconds)<BR>      I agree with a lot of Mezzmo's post.. Umbra seems no better than Shadow.. The Rune IV effect on the robe (25 sec to cast and eats a peridot) is useless.. The clarity in the trousers is only good for CR till i get enough mana to clarity II myself.. the 10sec cast time is impractical for other uses.. GRM (group magic resist) would be a better spell for the legs or bracer... If the robe cast Rune V (but didnt activate till 52) it would be fine even with its long cast time.<BR>    Anyway thats what leaps to mind<BR>Xriya</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I wanted to put in my 2 coppers worth on Enchanters :<P>[A] Illusions.<P>Even though my main character is an Enchanter and the spells are fun, I really don't think we should've gotten the undead illusions (Skeleton, Drybones). I think these should've remained uniquely Necromancer spells. Of course, I'm in the minority here and so it's unlikely that it will change, but that's just my opinion.<P>Along the same lines, I don't think we should get the Bear illusion (or, to be honest, probably even Wolf, but again, we already have it now). As much as I want "cool" spells for my class, I prefer that each class has certain specific things that are unique to it, especially if it fits in the the "spirit" of the class.<P>That said, however, I would like to see more illusions for the Enchanter. Of course, I understand the limitations of the global file, so It's not likely that we'll ever see Illusion: Froglok (as cool as I think that would be). Still, even within those limitations, I do have a few ideas:<P>(1) Illusion: Male and Illusion: Female. It's one of those spells (like the Necro spell that lets them talk through their pet) that doesn't really have any specific "game" purpose (ie. it doesn't make you more "powerful"), but it would just be fun. I think we need a few more "fun" spells for every class, within reason of course.<P>(2) Illusion: Monster I, Illusion: Monster II, etc. The new Velious Mage pet spells (which are a great idea, by the way!) gave me this idea. If there's no room in the global file, why not do for Enchanters what you did for Mages, only with illusions instead of pets. When the Enchanter casts the illusion spell, they would appear to turn into a creature of the appropriate level range from within the current zone.<P>I know there is some concern that this would make it too easy for Enchanters to travel anywhere unharmed, but I don't think this would neccessarily be the case. First, there are so many different creatures in any given zone, it's not as if the Enchanter would get to choose. Second, many creatures have no faction, so such an illusion would grant no real protection. Third, if I turn into, say, an Orc in Oasis, that might allow me travel through the Orc camps safely, but it wouldn't protect me from anything else.<P>(3) Allow "group" illusions at higher levels. Much like Wizards and Druids get to port themselves at lower levels, and then eventually get to port groups at higher levels, add Group Illusion: Race spells for the player races at higher levels. Since many people are complaining about the lack of illusions above level 44, you could start at level 49 and progress them from there. For example (based on the level progression of the original spells) :<P>        Level 49 - Group Illusion: Human, Group Illusion: Half-Elf<BR>        Level 51 - Group Illusion: Gnome, Group Illusion: Wood-Elf<BR>        Level 53 - Group Illusion: Dark-Elf, Group Illusion: Erudite, Group Illusion: Halfling, Group Illusion: High-Elf<BR>        Level 55 - Group Illusion: Barbarian, Group Illusion: Dwarf<BR>        Level 57 - Group Illusion: Troll, Group Illusion: Ogre, Group Illusion: Iksar<P>[B] Enchanting items. The one thing Enchanters really aren't yet are, well, "Enchanters". Other than enchanting metals and making mana vials (which still seem to have very limited use), Enchanters can't really "Enchant" anything else.<P>What I think would be useful, and appropriate, would be for an Enchanter to be able to "Enchant" existing items, to some degree. This could work similar to the Rogue's poison, in that it would go away when the character zones or logs, but in essence by holding an item on the cursor and casting an appropriate spell, the Enchanter could add a magic proc, ability or stat modified to the item (depending on the particular spell).<P>Perhaps, at a very high level (60th?), there could even be a "Permanence" spell that would convert the temporarily enchanted item into an actual magic item with the same enhancements.<P>[C] Group Alliance. At higher levels, perhaps there could be some way that an Enchanter could temporarily raise the faction of a group.<P>In conclusion, I would like to see each class have more abilities that are unique to that class, especially ones that give them more to offer in a grouping situation.<P>Thanks for your time and attention.<P>Cheers,<P>C. Scott<P><BR>PS. Please also read my "Some Small Suggestions" thread, as it has several small suggestions for the game, that aren't related to individual classes. Thanks!<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Enchanters are a great class and with charm and good charisma can even solo great assuming that you can trade sow for breeze.<P>The following are based on pre lvl 30 experiences…<P>In some cases though I feel “class-envy” (unbalanced?) <P>1) Fashion (applies to some other casters too). How many different robes are there at low to mid level…..? We completely miss out on the fun of designing a relatively unique look. How about improving tailoring to include nicer robes that we can enchant somehow…..<P>2) high red mobs. Not much for us to do except casting buffs and clarity. Tashan yes, but wont change anything. Memblur might be handy once in a while to detaunt mob from healers. And In Velious with high MR……Maybee it’s a compensation because we are so extremely sought after in other zones…<P>non-balance issue: I really would have expected charisma to play a bigger part in an enchanters life than now. It is really only nesseccary for charm. I would have thought you need charm to increase faction (alliance spells etc), make buffs more efficient, mezmerize (I tried casting mez 200 times on a mob with 155 charisma and with 105 charisma…no significant difference…)…..etc…<P>small bug: There is a big lag in the health bar when I have a charmed pet. Not until the mob that it attacks dies does the health bar move to its current value.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>First I am really glad you all giving everyone a chance to talk about the their classes. Good Job.<P>As far as enchanters go, I have 5 issues.<P>Lull series<BR> This is currently a completely useless line of spells. It is very much like the Druid and Ranger Harmony spell except it single target and agros on failure. The problem with it is that it has a high resists rate and you have to cast it on ALL of the spawn your breaking up. That means if it has a 25 % chance of failure and you have almost 100 % chance of it being resisted and you end up pulling more mobs than you want, most likely the whole spawn. And you party dies. <BR>My suggestion would be to make it non – agro. This line of spells would only help low-level chanters, since no chanter pulls at a high level. It would make people want to group with chanters below level 16. This change would not make people want chanters over druid at lower levels; it would just make chanters more desirable.<P>Runes <BR>I have read that the regent cost for cleric symbols are too high. Well, not when you consider runes. Why? Because runes don’t last very long. They are gone as soon as you get hit some. As a higher-level chanter, I rune the puller on every pull, otherwise, the pull would not make it back. At a perot per pull this becomes very expensive. But this is a powerful spell it should have a regent, just not a 10pp regent. If it were a 2, 3 or even 5 pp regent, it would make things a lot easier. If you want to reduce abuse, increase the cast time. It’s already a long cast, so long it’s hard to use in battle.<P><BR>Whirl Till You Hurl (WTYH) <BR>This is another useless spell line, not totally useless, just mostly useless. It sounds great a 12 second stun at level 12. WOW.  EXCEPT, it’s UP TO 12 seconds. I used this a number of times and I don’t think I ever got a stun to last more than 6 seconds, and most don’t last a second. A fair number of times the break was the next line of text after the stun line.  And as far as mana is concerned, it kinda expensive for that level:  55 mp: its even less than the 12 level dot that does 80hps (50 mp). <BR>My suggestions would be increase the minimum tine from 0 to say 2 seconds, and reduce the max from 12 to 8. This would make the spell a lot more useful.  <P>Pets – First everyone says chanters are not a pet class. Well, I disagree. Chanters get pets before mages do and more of them before level 50: Mages get pets at level 4, chanters get them at level 1. We both get a pet at every spell level until 50. So we get 1 more pet than mages, before 50. I would agree chanters pets are not very powerful. But even that was not true at one time. Chanter pets were awesome, once. Then they were nerfed. And they became what they are today, a weak defensive. Balance can be measured within the class or against other classes. So far other pets have been enhanced several times. But chanter pets are always left behind. This is not class envy, it just about being fair. No one can say that if a class gets a spells at EVERY spell level below 50 that it’s a very minor part of the class, and it was always intended to be minor. Therefore when VI nerfs that spell, along with 2 other classes that have the same type of spell, and compensation is given to 2 classes but not to the other classes, well … (this refers to the removal of the speed bonus when you give the pet a FS dagger). Mage pets got the ability to duel wield, Necro pets got the ability to cast a spell. Chanters Nothing. <P>Possible improvements<BR>1)	Have pets cast WTYH, a small stun that does nothing most of the time. <BR>2)	Increase the AC of them<BR>3)	Increase their speed of attack<BR>4)	Make the taunt better (better to get the mob off of the chanter)<BR>5)	Have the cast a dot or some debuf spell<P><BR> <P><BR>Illusions – There are many reasons why people play EQ. Most of them come back to one thing, it FUN to play. There are many ways to have fun play EQ. Some ways are level, get rare items, practice trade skills, or just have fun with the class. I became an enchanter because it looked fun, and I love it. I really enjoy playing around with the illusions. (Its really funny seeing a skel with 2 steins turning really funny)  But low and behold, our last illusion is a level 44 Werewolf. Nothing for the illusion class for 16 move levels. Up to that point we received as many as 4 new illusions at every level. From a gaming point of view, it’s pretty stupid to think that low-level chanters can gain more illusions than high-level chanter.  The argument has been made that “There are no more System resources” And it was a good argument when it first was said. Then the Necros got a Specter Pet. Then it was said gain, and the Necros got Lich form. Then it was said again. Then the Shaman got Form of the Great Bear. Now the argument is STILL being used. (http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/041319.html) This excuse is doesn’t work anymore. /em thinks about a little boy who cried wolf. <P>However, here are some good suggestions using the existing model. So there is No excuse that you can use other than “We Just don’t want to give Chanters any more Illusions”<P>Illusion Gender Male<BR>Illusion Gender Female<BR>Illusion copycat<BR>Illusion copy living creature (like minor illusion with living things)<BR>Illusion animation (our pet)<P>I really like Illusion Copy Living Creature. That would be fun.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is not just an enchanter issue, it affects all casters, but it cripples high level enchanters so i will mention it here. In all the high level (50+) zones in Scars of Velious the monsters have insane magic resistance or magic immunity. This relegates enchanters to just bufing in these zones since all our spells <BR>are magic based. Haste and clarity buffs are important but i am sorry i like to feel involved in the battles. Buffing the tanks and clerics every half hour is not fun. It is tedious, it is boring, it is the reason i stopped playing my 50+ enchanter. It is also probably the central reason of many caster class feeling useless post Velious release. I am not going to go into the increased monster hitpoint cap. This affects enchanters but is more of a damage caster issue. I really do not think there is a problem with enchanters as designed. Honestly, they are a powerful and usefell class as designed. The problem is that the high level Velious do not allow enchanters to be played as designed. The high level Velious zones have been designed to relegate enchanters to clarity/haste vending machines.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Okay, here's my two cents.<P>I see a lot of long winded talk here - something I'm nervous might scare off a lot of the Verant people reading this thread.  I see a lot of arguing about illusions.  You know what? The illusions are fine.  I'm not sure how such a fuss got raised over illusions and the lack thereof, but quite frankly, this is such a cosmetic issue, it makes me sick to think we're even wasting our time talking about this.  Stop talking about illusions, they're not causing us any strife.  You want strife? Play a ranger to level 52 and THEN tell me illusions are of some importance to be wasting the time of Verant on.<P>My issue is this.<P>Velious - you screwed us there pretty good.<P>Don't get me wrong, I like the joint, it's cool, but enchanters are essentially feeling unwanted there.  Now listen, you can tell us that we can color stun, clarity 2, tashan, etc. etc. - all that is fine, but you know very well that the prime feature of enchanters is mez and clarity.  Without the other, we're just mana buffers, and that is, quite frankly, boring.  We're not going to Velious because it puts us in a position where we're going to get bored, NOT because we can't crowd control.  Why would I want to go fight unmezzable giants that just frustrate me when I could crowd control 8 MOBs deep in Chardok?<P>So what's the solution? The solution is not to give us mez.  I accept the what you're trying to get across here - you want it to be harder.  That's fine.  You did a good job in Sebilis by making us have to use Kintaz for higher level MOBs but reducing the time limit on the mez.  You can do the same thing in Velious.  Make Kintaz the rule OR make all mezzes stick for ... oh... say 30-50% of their normal time limit.  That way, we can mez, but we gotta work hard to keep the mezzes going.<P>Tashia<BR>54th level enchanter - Xegony<BR>52nd level ranger - Xegony<BR>member of United Norrath and Xegony Alliance</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>SERIOUSLY<BR>There needs to be a double look at enchanters in PvP.  AE stuns kill/agro pets in our group.  AE mez affects our group.  Some of the best enchanter strategies do not work on the Zeks.  <P>There is a TREMENDOUS difference between PvP enchanter and blue server enchanter in the PvE game.<P>If you are going to make mobs 100% magic immune, give us an alternate method of contributing to combat.  <P>Buffing is nice....healing is great, but people play EQ to FIGHT epic battles.  They want to contribue in a real, DIRECT manner to the demise of awesome dragons and loot unheard of treasures.<P>Mezmo about nailed it...<P>Anyone that thinks enchanters should be nerfed doesn't know (or doesn't recall) the growing pains of this class.  <P>Shamans ARE the king of buffs.  Except for haste, any buffs we share are done better by the medicine men.  Haste is our province, not theirs.<P>Mezmo is very knowledgeable..listen to him.<P>We either need better blurs post 35, less aggro from our spells, or better ability to take damage (weren't enchanters leather class wearers in early beta? not that that would really stop a quad for 850, but every bit counts :P)<P>Give me something for taking the HUGE penalty of taking on religion (before I knew better).  Am I the only enchantress in all of Norrath that follows Erollisi Marr (Erolissi, Erollissi...the spelling changes a lot in game/manuals).  I STILL don't understand why mobs that hate me see through my illusions to kill me.  You argue we wear our holy symbols outside our illusions....ok (and I have a 190+ intelligence...that is not to bright).  Why don't the mob that love me see those symbols and not kill me?  "Oh, a Tier'Dal that follows Erollisi Marr," says a shocked Guard Pineshade, "She's okay boys.  Let her pass."<P>I would think A disciple of the Goddess of Love would be able to buff AMAZING charisma (HINT HINT:  religion specific item for the class most penalized by religion).<P>oh yeah, that mezmo guy is pretty sharp....listen to him.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would have to agree with two very well thought out posts.<P>1) We need to be ILLUSIONISTS.  Currently, 1/4th of the classes are illusionists.  Throw us a bone.  It's bad enough our 'illusions' don't mask our religion and we can still be killed with no warning.  Also, when I'm in illusion form, people come up and click on me and see my robe of foci and know I'm an enchanter.  That sucks!  We should be able to turn inspection off (all classes should) so that we can remain illusioned.<P>2) Enchanters are a TANKING class.  Look at the spells we have, AE stuns, the most powerful spells really, at least at lower levels.  We need more AC.  The AC I have is pathetic and I'm in tanking with the rest of my troops doing AE stun.  I get hit twice in Velious and I'm at 1/2 damage.  Oh wait, forgot, we also have MEGA taunt on all of our spells.  I can't even back up and get a heal because everything follows me.<P>The taunt is fine and expected, but since debuffs don't really lower much of anything as far as damage goes, enchanters need to be able to take a few more hits.  AC is the way we need to go.<P>Lull spells - Useless.  You can find the few I bought on page 50 of my spell book.  Does that explain how useless they are?<P>Gift of Magic - What gift?  + 75 mana at level 34?  Yay, every can cast an extra 1/2 spell.  It's a waste of time and mana to me.  It would be better if it was converted to give a bubble of my mana to someone else instantly.  THAT is a gift.  Otherwise, I don't use this spell.<P>We're powerful and balanced, but these things need to be looked into.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I've played an enchanter now for over a year, made level 55, so far I'm more or less happy with the way my class works however there are a few things I think need to be addressed<P>-Illusions-<BR>We don't get any past 44.. even the boon of the garou is level 44.  We asked for illusion spectre/bear/nearest mob etc.  Spectre was originally denied due to hardware issues and available memory, it was later added to necros.  Yeah I feel a bit jipped but I can *sort of* understand the reasoning behind why we didn't get one, but as a counter point to VI's reason, if we don't get illusion spectre, why the jivl do we get skeleton and dry bone?<P>Illusion Bear, not many people asked for this, but it was given to shaman, another model that was made global.. yet enchanters get nothing, the whole it will enable enchanters to change to different factions not normally possible thing is a moot point as we already have a wolf form illusion.. uses the same faction if I'm not mistaken (which I could be but only someone from VI could tell us)<P>Taking the form of the nearest mob is out, understandibly so, I agree there should be certain limitations to our power, this would be "unbalancing" because we could go anywhere in any dungeon.. just about at least.<P>Boon of the garou, a nice step in the right direction, however IMHO was implemented wrong.  I'd personally prefer a group spell, much like group wolf form that would change my entire group to werewolves, elementals, etc. We're not looking for insane stat buffs on them either, mostly because it's "Cool" one more spell in our bag of tricks.<P>Some suggestions for "group illusion" spell<P>Group Earth elemental form - Minor STR increase (IE the ten we get from our own)<BR>The str buff stacks with every other str buff in the game (except other illusions of course) not unbalancing because it doesn't increase it by much<P>Group Werewolf form - Minor STR, and ATK buff (Enchanter only version grants us both, but at the level attained does us two things.. jack and squat) Keep the stat bonuses the same, again not unbalancing because a druid can do the same thing, so can we , this just makes it a little bit easier, more mana effecient to the enchanter<P>In general I'd like to see enchanters get a line of spells similar to these, even if it only shared the form. Why? because it's cool, adds a little more fun to the game, and heck.. ask most tanks who have had boon of the garou cast on them, it's fun to be something "different"<P>Self Illusions, we need more of them, (51st level title is Illusionist, yet where are the illusions?) <P>Illusion Female/Male - Oh C'mon how in the heck could this affect factions, all the player models are in the zone memory or wherever it's stored, no stat bonuses, nothing crazy like that.. just a nice way to skim some extra plat off that item you're buying from someone else (yeah it's shameless but I'm poor =p)<P>Illusion Froglok - FROOOOOOOOOOOOAK! (ok not likely but worth a shot)<P>Illusion Somethingotherthanwealreadyhave - C'mon I only have 40 pages of spells I NEED MORE!!!<P>-Pets-<BR>Like most other enchanters I've come to realize my pet is more like a dot that occasionally bashes to interrupt casting<P>Give us a few pet commands, not all of them just a few<BR>/pet guard here - prevents pets from wandering off on the bad pathing in dungeons<BR>/pet report health - saves us time and having to switch targets<P>Add these to pets past level 39 and you'd make a lot of enchanters happy, I know we're not a primary pet class, but neither are shaman, yet they have all the commands.. most of us just want a few<P>-Summoning Spells-<BR>Almost every other castign class in the game has some sort of Summon item spell, we don't. Give us something like Summon Globe of Light. We need some way to summon something so our corpse doesn't decay in 30 seconds if we get killed before we can be ressed. even Wizards have soemthing like this, so no way it could be unbalancing<P>-Rune spells-<BR>If I cast Rune III on someone during battle, it will taunt more than a clerics complete heal... 300 hps is considerably less than 4000 on an ogre warrior...<P>Otherwise I like the way these work, regaents are damn expensive, but not to the point it's as much of a burden on us as it is on clerics<P>-Enchanting Metal for Smithing and Jeweling-<BR>Not much we could improve here for jeweling, smithing is another story...<P>Jacinths needed to enchant Steel, and Brellium used in jewelry making, hard to get ahold of for smiths as it makes some nice MR gear. Smiths get the short end of the stick most often.<P>Blue Diamonds, not too hard to obtain.. but I think I heard soemthign about them being used in jewelry now.. thats a BAD idea imho because now we yet again have the same problems we do with jacinths.<P>Change the regaents please, will make everyone happier<P>-Enchanting Weapons-<BR>The original guidebook said we'd be able to do this, I believe it was also part of the original Vision(tm), however due to whatever reasons we can't add a temporary effect to a weapon.. we can assist in making enchanted magical weapons with nice stats, but the closest we come to a proc, is the lifetap proc given with Boon of the garou<P>Solution: Give us a line of "buffs" that gives whoever we cast it one a proc on their weapon much like the boon of the garou, or the other class specific ones, not terribly unbalancing because the majority of them have their own, would just allow us to give them a little extra firepower<P>-Melee skills-<BR>I want higher defense,offense, caps as well as higher caps on my melee weapon skills... ok not really but still a little boost to defense would help some as we get hit a lot<P>Elemak Wetchik<BR>55th Enchanter of Ayonae Ro<BR>~Outcasts and Exiles~</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One very larger concern of mine is the high magic resistance rate of high level creatures in the expansions.  One possible solution could be another magic resistance spell or an upgrade to the one we have.  It should be a very large upgrade, maybe double the current one.<P>Another idea is 'potions'.  Clarity is similar to SoW when viewed at how much its wanted, there are sow potions in the game so I see no reason for there to not be clarity items.  I definitly do not want clarity potions but jewelry would be nice.  It should cost about 10pp per charge to make, maybe take two metals and a vial of mana.  For example maybe a ench gold bar + ench silver bar + vial of &lt;somekind&gt; mana = 1 charge clarity ring.  Maybe a ench plat bar + ench gold bar + 2 vials &lt;somehigherkind&gt; mana = 10 charge clarity ring/necklace/braclet whatever.  Some formula for a alacrity (24th lvl 40% haste) would be nice too. <P>These would be a great benifit durring high level raids where enchanters can't mez because of the resistances and spend all their time sitting and waiting until everyone needs clarity refreshed and the tanks need haste refreshed, it would allow for the mana to be spent earlier so we could nuke etc.<P>More illusions are always nice.  While you don't see a reason that enchanters should get undead illusions or animal illusions, I do.  Enchanters are the masters of illusion, we should be able to make others think we look like any one or anything.  We shouldn't be limiited because an illusion is an animal or undead, cmon I can be a torch since level 4, I think I can pretend to be a bear later on. <P>On a side note of illusions, they don't show up in /w all.  If I am a dark elf and use a high elf illusion, a /w mahkahl will show my race as high elf, a /w mahkahl all will show my race as a dark elf.  Not to important on blue servers, and I guess not too important on red servers because of anon etc., but it would be very nice for this to work.  It would also be nice if the races tree, skeleton, wolf, elemental, spectre and bear were added to the races that showed instead of &lt;unknown&gt;.  <P>For the most part I think my class is really good, I have no trouble getting into groups most of the time and its fun to play.<P> - Mahkahl Darkwolfe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 16 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-11.html">11</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-12.html">12</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-13.html">13</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-14.html">14</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-15.html">15</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-16.html">16</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052139&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052139&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
