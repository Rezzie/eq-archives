I know, your first question is going to be, how did I decide to pick druids to be next? Well, honestly, it just came up in conversation today with a co-worker. There’s no trick to it. I would certainly address the ones most in need first, but until I’ve actually done all these posts, I won’t know which is most in need… (let’s not make that the topic of this post, please)<BR>So the question is, what is it that the druid community thinks they need to become a ‘balanced’ class? What is lacking? What is over-powered? - yes, that’s a valid question for any class –<P>This time I’m starting this post with very little information to lead with, so I feel like I’m at a bit of a disadvantage. I do know that, like many other classes, some druids feel that they don’t have enough to do while at the final encounter of the big raid. One of the suggestions to change that falls along the same lines as one proposed by the shaman community, changing/improving their healing abilities post 50.<P>I want you to understand that I think druids are pretty well balanced all around, and I really see little that needs to be changed (and that’s partially why I picked them to be the topic today…). So you’ll have to be convincing, logical and articulate to convince me. <P>Alan<p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]

</FONT><HR>As druids, before Kunark we believed our purpose was to fulfill the needs of the groups we're in. People laugh and say we have no specialty, but that's just not  true. Our true specialty was our powers of balance -we took unbalanced groups and made them balanced enough to work. The role we played most often was group healer, and it's so easy to see why. Wizards, Necromancers, Mages, Monks, Rogues, Rangers, and Warriors all did a lot of damage already, and shamans and clerics were the only other healers. Since healing was in such short supply, and because our fire based nukes were so resisted in 4 out of 5 encounters back then, we played the role of group healer the most. <P>Our healing was really much too weak, but at least our thorns and dots and chloroplast gave enough of a "nature's heal" and a "nature's defense" that we could still see to our group's needs by putting them all together. <P>Things changed for the worse in Kunark after 50th level, and Velious went even further. The monsters have so many hp, such strong resists, and do so much damage our powers in every area but our snares and evac spells were completely overshadowed by monster inflation. The only real value we can still offer a group after 50th level is a snare spell (which five other classes already have), and our evacs. Being reduced to basically the group chauffeur is certainly *not* a fulfilling way to play, and the fact that we just aren't effective in our old roles anymore means a lot of the people who would have had groups before Kunark have to spend their time at the zone LFG today and doing without.<P>Take away our quad-kiting power. It really is overpowered. Take away some of our soloing power if you must, but first and forever a priest should be able to see to the needs of her group, and that's something we lost after 50th level.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1. druids are a dime a dozen.. in a regular group they do great, the ONLY thing I'd change is the fizzle rate.<P>2. as to moving up heals.. shamans have a point. Being the prime healer in their groups, upgrade the shaman heals. As far as group desirabily, stats mean so little that a primary thing of a shaman has gone to waste. Increasing the shaman's ability to heal (aka move sup heal to 49 and give them another heal at 55) would make it more desirable to play a shaman.. and a lot of the players would actually switch to druids, solving two problems in one.<P>Wyrd</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Pretty much the same thing most others have been saying...<P>1) Better healing...Don't have SHeal yet, but already, at 47, I can tell that I can't take the role of primary healer much longer.<P>2) Mid-level quests.  Something between 30 and 40.<P>3) Immolate line.  I quite trying to get it to stick on mobs about 10 levels ago.  Every so often I try it on a green cold-based mob (ice giants, snow dervishes, etc).  I watch it get resisted about 50%, shrug, and put it into the back of the book.<P>4) Charm animal line.  I know we get a new one at 54 that won't agro mobs.  But it seems silly that the priests of nature, that have amialbe animal friends, can't get a charm to last 5 seconds on a green rat?  At level 47?  Something not quite right with that.<P>In general, though, I find druids well balanced and fun to play.  The serious issues are fairly minor.<P>Of course there are little things that druids would like to see, of course...SoW2, more animal forms, better port spots on West Antonica and Kunark...safer port spots in Vellious.  But wizards can say the same thing, too.<P>Thanks for listening.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>-Puppypaws Fleetfoot, Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You're joking right? You want to balance druids? Then take some stuff away. The imbalance here is that the class of druid is so easy to play that pretty much any fool can do it. The class has so many goodies that the players face no challenge. Should we really to listen to them complain because the other classes that elected to take a harder road get bigger rewards in the end for their efforts?<P>Cry me a river. You had a ridiculously easy class up to 50 or so. Now pay your dues like everybody else.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>BTW. To people asking for improved charm.  Wait until 53, Glamour of Tunare is better than you'd think.  In my experience Glamour more than doubles the duration of Call of Karana.  Sure there are still insta-breaks but I've often been able to keep a pet in chardok long enough to solo multiple mobs with it (hasted) before dispelling it and letting my group finish it.  Of course, i wouldn't mind making glamour of tunare -50mr or 40mr instead of -20, but beggers can't be choosers. I'm happy with Call, just wish they'd fix Tunare's Request.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Well the subject of this post was to discuss BALANCE of the druid not a wishlist or to gripe so I am going to attempt to do just that. First off thanks for asking Absor.<BR>All in all I agree mostly with you Absor that druids are balanced up to high 40s in level. The balancing of the druid abilities in healing compared to the tasks asked of them are lacking. The moving of superior heal to 49th level would help solve this. By recieving this spell earlier the fizzle rates would drop due to use and the role of secondary healer would definate re materialize. With addition of the new spells for clerics in both post 50s and Velious expansion would keep the clerics as the 'masters' of healing. This would of course apply to the Shaman as well. The possible addition of an even stronger heal spell in the upper 50s would also assist in this but since the actual numbers of other healing spells are not known to me I am not going to attempt to define one.<P>Some of our spells are just not needed or useable as intended. The ability to use are ability greatly effects our balance in my eyes. If they were 'tweaked' to be useable as intended, I would see no need to add anymore spells. The charm animal series is a perfect example. Only truly effective for a descent amount of time on very very green animals. Perhaps a time limit based near the enchanters ability to charm would be a solution to these spells. The level cap of these spells (35th level) also makes the higher level versions basically useless. Beguile plants is another example of the issue. There are very few plants in the lands as is. Those that do exist are almost all over 35th meaning no need to try. Enduring breaths cast time could use some speeding up. Reason is that if you are sitting down from the moment you see the icon blink you are lucky to be able to stand up and cast before it wears off and drown. If you are looking at your spell book at the time you will fail. One other example is the bear pet spells level. Though not far off it being that low makes it a toy spell more than an added ability. If changing the level of the pet would be too over powering possible just increasing the hit points of the pet would be sufficent. Being that the druids melee skills are capped the addition of the pet does balance us to the melee abilities of the shaman.<P>If all of our spells were actually useful for what they were meant to be used for and the addition/moving of the heal spell(s) were accomplished I would say simply we are balanced.<P>(couldn't resist on the wants they are below)<P>Would be nice to have the North karanas ring moved to surefall glade. East Karanas ring is there already no need for two rings next to each other.<P>The continued addition of utlity spells and fun spells though not dropped but quested for. The beguile plant quest was a great way to pass on a new spell in my honest opinion. Great job on that one. Lets see more.<P>Fix or add quests that are based around the druids. One quest off the top of my head is the Nitrate/assasin quest. It has not worked as intended ever since seeing it right after beta. The story line is great but druids are sitting here saying 'what happens next?'. By giving/fixing these quests it might give more reason for guard killing druids to rethink their reasons for ruining factions. I see this being done with the epic and the Tunare quests (the second only helps the Tunare druids though) but other quests could do nothing but help give some of the druids direction to thier lives.<P>And my final, would be nice is... the re evaluation of having our 34th and 39th level spells dropping off of 55+ monsters in Velious.<P>Thank you for your time and patience<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>btw regarding charm. The enchanter's charm line also insta-breaks. But it's based on chr (which druids don't bring up like enchanters) so that's why druids have a pretty bad failure rate.<P>I -would- like to see a charm that's got a 30sec guaranteed duration, then go up to 5min as usual (something similiar to improved invis line).  That way once you charm it, at least it won't break as soon as you tell your group you charmed it =P<P>Wyrd</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Things I can think of right away -<P>More gates - near halas, make wind of north/south castable from anywhere, self only equivalents of all gates.<P>Better heals - move sup heal to 49 and have a 1000+pt heal at 53/54 that uses the same mana as sheal.<P>Ressurection - the equiv of a cleric 49 res but it needs a gem that costs about 50pp to cast.  Make it a lvl 55 or 56 spell.  This will not devalue clerics as at that lvl they can total exp res so would still be the preferred choice, but what it would mean is that a raid doesnt get cancelled the minute a cleric cant go.  It makes sense than a druid can res anyway.<P>An unresistable nuke - Not just druids this one, but most caster classes.  Most classes are ineffective against mobs such as VS, give them all a lower dmg than wizzie lure but still unresistable nuke at 55ish so they can take part in raids against MR mobs.<P>Animals - Not really anything I'm bothered with really, but more mobs should be marked as animals.  The gorrillas in burning woods for example.<P>Armor looks - druids either look like noobs or rangers, any other look has really bad ac or stats.<P>Armor weight - Why is all druid armor so much more heavy than other classes.?  The ac is also far worse than other priest classes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Trap though I do appreciate your thoughts and views as a cleric. Your situation is not what he asked and flaming just takes away the whole idea.  Arguing a point does nothing if insults are the way of arguing.  What you have seen is just that what you have seen.  I myself have never seen that happen in the years I have been in this game.  If some do log on thier clerics for a rez and then log off to play thier other character... fine.  That is thier choice and is going to happen as long as people can have multiple characters on the same servers.  The same can be said for Twinking.<P>The reason I reposted was because of posts like yours taking away from his true question filling up the threads.  Your opinions are just as important as mine or anyone elses but could you help everyone out and post on the subject?  If you feel that the druids are completly balanced (That is what the post is about balance) then feel free to state so.  Flaming or posting against someone else without posting solutions just takes away from the whole idea of asking.<P>In closing, those are my opinions... you are of course welcome to not agree with them, but mine none the less.  Balance between the classes is what he asked about, that is what I posted about plan and simple.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The #1 problem with druids is that MOST of the people that play them have absolutely no clue how to.  The majority of druids solo up into their 50s, some that haven't even seen groupchat, besides the random port they do.  For this reason, in high level dungeons, people are weary to group with druids, as some posters have already mentioned.<P>Druids aren't needed in groups, and no class should be necissary, but it goes farther than that druids aren't WANTED in groups.  At this time, druids don't have anything to offer to a group that other class(es) can.<P>Snare: This isn't unique to druids, so druids mostlikely won't be invited to a group just because of it.  <P>Heals: Our heals 50+ are a joke.  There's definately no way that a druid by themselves can keep up with the heals in a group without significant downtime.  The average tank 50+ will have atleast 2500hp.. where warriors at level 60 will have 3000hp with no buffs.  Keeping this in mind, a cleric using Complete Heal will heal somewhere between 1800hp to 4000hp, depending on the tank in the group, for 400 mana.  So, using Complete Heal, the cleric gets between 4.5hp/mana to 10hp/mana.  Another point is, that clerics don't have to use complete heal often in most groups.  With a shaman or enchanter slowing the mobs, the cleric would only be using complete heal during bigger fights.<P>Damage Shields: These are a joke 50+ as well.  Mage have better shields than druids, so when grouped with a mage, this is one less thing a druid has to offer to a group.  Another point is that 50+(Specifically 55+), every group has either a shaman or an enchanter to slow mobs.  Slow totally destroys the efficiency of damage shields.<P>Regen: This is good, but there is one downfall.. The level 44 cleric spell Celestial Healing used to stack with long duration regen spells, but as of 2 patches ago it now overwrites them.  Regen isn't class defining, but it's nice to heal up the little damage left after a battle.  Either a cleric has to self the lvl 44 heal, or the druid selfs regen.<P>Nukes: In their current state, druid nukes are perfect IMO.<P>Teleports: It would be nice to have Egress points that make transportation easier.  Such has having the Egress point in Dreadlands closer to Karnor or Fironia Vie.  Druids have no need for anymore teleport spells though.<P>Succor: This spell is a death trap and doesn't really have much use.  This spell should remove the group from the hate list 100% of the time.  If you use the spell in it's current state as an evac, mobs that can summon players will 1 by 1 summon the group back to it's death.<P>DoTs: These are great in their current state, don't change them, we have enough kiting druids as there is.<P>Solutions: It's very hard to come to a solution to how to make druids more viable in groups without in some way hurting other classes.  <P>I recommend removing the extremely high fizzle rates on all 50+ spells for all classes as this will benefit all.  Certain spells, such as Breath of Ro and Superior Healing come to mind for druids, and I've heard complaints from other classes about certain spells being extremely bad for fizzles.<P>As for damage shields, Maybe they should be scaled to the delay of the mob like Mark of Karn.  Instead of doing a fixed damage per hit, they should be tuned to X damage per minute.  If we take the level 49 druid single target spell Shield of Thorns, the spell does 25 damage per hit.  If a mob has a base delay of 30, it would attack 20 times in a minute.  We'll say the mob also double attacks 80% of the time and hits the player 60% of the time.  So in 1 minute, the mob would hit a player 22 times(rounded) and the damage shield would do 550 damage in a minute against the average mob.(Somehow this figure seems low, but we'll go with it)   If a shaman is using the level 51 slow spell Turgur's Insects, which slows the mob 75%, the mobs new delay would be 53(rounded again).  The mob would hit a player 11 times in a minute and the damage shield would do 275 damage.  The recommended change would change this spell from a 25 damage per hit spell to a (25*Delay)/30 spell, so in the second case, the spell would do 44 damage per tick.  This change is a very small one, and won't significantly change much, but it's a step in the right direction.<P>As for healing, it would be nice to have a faster casting heal with a ratio around 4.0hp/mana (basically the low end of a clerics complete heal spell used in the low 50s), but the problem with this, is that clerics themselves don't get a heal better than 2.6hp/mana (Divine Light at level 53).  A spell similar to Celestial Healing might work, but without giving clerics another heal, it wouldn't be viable to give druids a better heal.<P>Absolutely no change should be made to druids soloability, they already are extremely good soloers, and this is the main reason that higher level druids have troubles getting into groups.  The extremely high number of druids coupled with the extremely high percentage of druids that have little grouping experience makes the druid class not wanted in pickup groups.<P>Krumble - 56 Druid<BR>Kampf - 51 Cleric<BR>Cazic-Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My primary is a Druid but only 19th level.<P>I really have little to add to the awesome feedback that has already come out except one thing about the "charm" line...<P>While I realize that CHA plays a major factor in the duration of the charm, I really think that the level difference should also be a factor. The comment above about a rat turning on a 47th lvl is simply too funny... when the level difference is ignored, it's kinda like a Noob just being told he has to play nice by a GM, then he attacks the GM... While this may have happened, animal instincts are better than this... Their goal is usually self preservation.<P>A quick thought on how the the Charm line might work better...<P>Duration based on (CHA*level) +/- three times the difference of the casters level vs Animals level... WITH the charm being unbreakable at 120sec or unsuccessful at 30 sec or less...  I think a 35th level Dru with 140 CHA, charming a lvl 5 Giant Rat should not have it end. (49+3*30=139)... So a lvl 22 with 150 CHA (base 33 sec)trying to charm a creature 2 levels above would fail.<P>Try this instead of auto aggro: Any creature that has been charmed should drop two levels of faction upon ending of the charm, say from amiably to indifferent... thus if you charm repeatedly, you THEN run the risk of the aggro. If you fail your attempt the creature stops and "looks at you" instead of "blinks" and the faction changes... if the creature would normally attack... so be it, but creature started as friendly it should progressively move to the other side...<P>OR<P>Each creature the Charmed animal attacks reduces the faction buy one... If the animal has at no point attacked or been attacked, there is NO reason for the instant Aggro... all it did was walk with you or sit with you for company...<P>Just a few thoughts...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Snare should only break from a DD spell, not a dot or melee damage.

Please keep in mind the sheer number of druids on every server.  On EVERY raid there will be druids, sometimes more druids than any other class.  The primary reason many druids are left out on raids is the volume of druids...not everyone can go.<P>Also, Druids are semi-redundant when grouped, therefore not as desirable when stacked.  <P>In light of all this, the biggest drawback to the druid class is the ease of leveling, believe it or not.  When you encounter a high level player, you expect a certain degree of competence in grouping.  This is not so with many druids as they level their way to 50 without learning what enchanter mez is, assist is or how that snare will not break mez, but their druid root will.<P>It is difficult to be an effective druid in a group, especially groups that rely on you.  I can't count the number of times that my guild has invited a druid to hunt with us and watched that druid go OOM from nuking, say OOM and then jump up and start to melee a mob who hits for 100+.<P>There is a difficult transition for Druids to overcome when facing the reality of grouping dynamics.  This should not be removed with greater abilities to make up for a lack of sensitive, group oriented, playstyles IMO.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>How I came to be a Druid.<P>My first character in everquest was a Wizard.  I played him up to 20 and liked him a lot even though they got a bad rap as not being any good.  I quit playing him though because I was tired of watching someone 10 feet from the zone line in need of a heal to make it and I could do nothing about it, since usually it was multiple mobs and rooting/nuking one wouldn't help.  I loved the nukes and the port spells I got, so the next logical choice for me was druid to add a little healing to the mix.<P>I loved my druid after he got his port spells and sow and he had heals and he could nuke pretty good.  Then I got regen and chloroplast and I really felt good about keeping my group healed, but once you hit 49 it's just not the same.  My druid is now 51 and I got tired of playing him... why?<P>First off he can't heal very good, one of the primary reasons I chose to move on to druid.  I don't think druids need anything better than Superior Heal, but think they need it at 49 instead.  I have a cleric now and he is level 45, he has had superior heal at 34, complete heal at 39, and now celestial healing at 44, his healing ability from 39 and 44 is phenominal and giving druids his 34 spell at 49 is not unbalancing and doesn't take away the need for a cleric at that level by any means.  This is THE safest bet to helping balance druids you can make, by putting superior healing at 49 for druids.  I would even say 44 would be safe too now with celestial healing, but if 49 is what you can manage, we'll take it.<P>The second reason for not playing my druid anymore was armor.  My druid looks the same now as he has for past 15 or so levels, and looks exactly the same as most other non-uber druids.  I really don't care if the stats and AC are not better than what is available currently, heck make it worse, but I want to look different.  My cleric wore the cleric quest armor from level 1 - 37 (when i replaced the arms with Donal's) and 45 (when i replaced gloves, with gauntlets of the black), not because the stats had uber +wisdom, which they don't (only bracers have wisdom), but because he looked nice and uniform, and not like a newbie.  There are plenty of non-visible items to up your wisdom with.  I've done the warrior armor quests (all nine items) 3 times, takes me 8 hours to get all the items needed or less for full suit.  I did the ranger armor quests once, and I've done the cleric armor quests 2-3 times depending on the piece, some pieces as many as 10+ times.  I did them and made characters to use them, just so I could say wow I look good and feel like I actually accomplished something.  What armor I would like to see for druids in Brown Chain (yes druids aren't supposed to use chain based armor, but it's the closest thing to something woven from tree bark or some strong cord, without adding new graphics, just different tint).  This would help me a lot since I could feel I accomplished something.<P>I guess those are my only two big gripes, but these would be so easy for you fix and wouldn't unbalance or overpower druids by any means.<P>As a wisdom based caster whos job it is to heal in lack of a cleric, I think that our ability should be increased a bit.  Clerics have Complete Healing, Celestial Healing, Remedy, Divine Light, Celestial Elixer, not to mention the "word" line of group heal spells, giving us a spell we already get at at 44 or 49 instead would not over-power us.  Maybe even a better heal like divine light at 55-60 somewhere would be helpful, but looking at the cleric lineup I don't think it would take too much away from them, and as a 45 cleric I wouldn't feel like my primary job was threatened by druids by any means.<P>Sorry rambling now how I want to heal better.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Only one thing really needs to be addressed IMO with reguards to druids post 50.<P>Healing.<P>I do not think that superior heal should have it's casting level lowered. What it needs is its fizzle rate lowered.  (perhaps an increase in channeling would help as well).<P>Druids do need a new heal spell, *sort of*.  What is really required is simply a faster casting heal spell.  We don't need to heal more hps then we do with sup heal.  We do need a spell that can be cast faster.  Our roll is back up healer.  We keep people alive while the cleric is doing the real healing.  The problem with sup heal is that it heals to few hps for its 4.5 sec cast time.  It either needs to heal more hps for that cast time, (I personally would like this option), or it needs to heal the same amout of hps but in 2.5 or 3.0 secs with LITTLE chance of fizzling.  Perhaps this could be a lvl 59/60 spell if Verant feels its a balance issue.<P>Please don't think I want to be a cleric, I don't.  I have /played of over 200 days.  I love my druid.  Although it is true druid healing as it stands is fine for the old world and MOST of Kunark, it is almost meaningless in Velious.  If you start looking at where the high level players hunt, you'll see monsters that can do more damage in one round of combat then can be healed with a single sup heal.<P>Feyn Windwalker<BR>Solusek Ro<P>PS.  If I were to ask for the moon I would ask that perhaps our skill max for melee might be raised just a tad.. say to 4 points (or asking for the stars too 5 points) per lvl</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It is all about mana efficiency and/or hp-healed/second.<P>Give druids a healing spell at 58+ that either:<P>1)  Heals more hit points and is slightly more efficient than superior heal (maybe casts slightly.. very slightly.. longer)<P>2) Heals the same as a superior heal BUT is significantly less cast time at a slight cost to mana efficiency and/or recast time.<P>The reasoning is that right now, even in a pinch against high level mobs, a druid can *at most* buy 1 to 2 seconds of time for a tank, provided we can get the superior heal off in time at all.  Either let us heal more or let us heal faster.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Greetings all,<P>My primary is a druid, level 53, now 52 (deding  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> ). I've also played a monk to ~40, an enchanter, and a necro. (Hated being KoS everywhere!).<P>I can group because people know me, and they presumably enjoy my company. But it's definitely getting tougher and I really feel a hanger on at many epic events. I think I've gained about 8 levels soloing (and that includes the levels one to 5!), and the rest grouping.<P>I start from the premise that any changes made to druids should be to enhance their ability to group. As so many have correctly said, druids have a ridiculously easy time soloing.<P>I agree with what so very many have said on S'Heal, though didn't have long to test it out. The fizzle rates seemed inordinate to me.<P>I also LOVE the idea of a healing over time spell. That makes sense as a good fit with druids/shamans. (this would only be a post 50 spell).<P>The argument that people would pick a druid over a cleric seems, with respect, absurd to me. Perhaps at levels up to 38 or so; but as you get higher and higher level, the clerics ressurect ability becomes more and more vital.<P>Charm animals -- it would be nice to see that become a more useful skill, though precisely how it could be a more useful grouping skill would be tricky (without it being a more powerful soloing skill).<P>One thing I haven't seen anyone mention (though I have NOT read all 12 pages) is the issue of anti-summoned nuking. I had always been under the impression that druids were specialist anti-summoned nukers. This holds up nicely til about level 48, but thereafter, until level 60 (If I'm not mistaken) Mages are equal or better than we are.<P>My suggestions would be...<BR>1) fizzle rate on s'heal<BR>2) perhaps a healing over time or better post 50 healing spell.<BR>3) Some anti-summoned nuking in the 50's <BR>4) maybe a look at planar armor stats/weight and quests for midlevel armor.<P>In summary, I feel, as do many that it's the post 50 grouping game and epic encounters where druids seem to be lacking.<P>Thanks for starting this discussion, Absor!<P>--Catrin Truesilver<BR>Wandering Hero of Luclin.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is the most ignorant thread yet. I have no problem with slightly improving the Druid fizzle rate on Superior Heal for them, but any more than that will be ridiculous. Druids are the most balanced class in-game and the most popular. Improvoving them even further in order to take a Cleric's spot in the group( which will happen! ) Is the most insane thing I've seen suggested. While the Druids fly through 1-50 and we Clerics are sitting in our group earning our keep, straining to reach the next level, thus earning the right to be the only real healers post 50. You now want to give that away too? There is a reason everyone plays Druids you know. Improving Druids further and taking away groups from the Cleric would be the end of it for me. You havta pay for being so insanely good 1-50 and if a slight lack post 50 is it..then so be it. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
