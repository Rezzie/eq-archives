A lack of healers on Stromm made trying to do LDoN there nearly impossible, and when there were healers, there weren't enough bards or enchanters for dungeons where the risk of multipulling casters was great.  The bottleneck of needing, or having to have "class X" to form a group is one of the biggest obstacles facing the player who would like to log in and play for a couple hours (say LDoN or more general xp grinding.)  I believe the answer to this problem is to move away from a system of specialists and towards a system where approximately 1/4 of the classes in the game could fulfill that role optimally, and another 1/4 could function in that role well enough to "get the job done."<P>This is, as I understand it, the system that will be in place for EQ2, with the 4 base classes (warrior, mage, priest, and scout) all being able to function in the core role of their class, but then building on top of it enough flavor and differance so that the progressively differant branching classes are all reasonably unique.  Ideally, this would be the approach to use for EQ, but I am uncertain if its possible this late in the game for something on that level to be possible.<P>Adding new spells to the various casting/mana based classes, and new combat maneuvers to the pure melee classes (and to a limited extent the hybrids) might be a way of mimicking this.  For this to happen though, all of the intelligence casters would need to have more common spells of the types deemed necessary, and likewise for the priests.  The new spells would be common across the two main caster archetypes (and perhaps shared with their hybrid offshoots) but would be gained at later levels (using the example of pacification, gained by enchanters at 62, clerics at 65, despite it being cross-archetype) and being general spells would be commensurately more expensive in terms of mana.<P>If you define the primary role of the warrior archetype as tanking, and the scout archetype as DPS, then perhaps the secondary role of the warrior archetypes could be melee DPS and the secondary roles of the scouts tanking.  Warrior-archetyes (warrior, paladin, shadow knight) would be as better in tanking as scout archetypes (ranger, beastlord, rogue, bard, monk) would be in melee DPS, but both classes would be well equipped to handle either role in an xp group or dealing with non-boss-mobs.  Ok, I know bards and monks aren't really "scouts" but they aren't casters in the traditional sense and they also aren't tanks - this is not meant to be precision, but merely lay out a general vision.<P>Enchanters would have enchanter-specific spells that would be more mana efficient and produce less hate for crowd-control purposes, while retaining their specialty spells in charming, illusions, hasting, and slowing.  All other intelligence or arcane casters would have access to the "general" versions of these spells which would produce greater hate and take more mana.  Similarly, magic-based damage could be identified as "general" and then wizards could get better efficiency magic spells, as well as fire and cold spells that cast faster and hit harder.  Mages would have their fire spells, and their various conjurations, and spells specialized in dealing with controlling, summoning, and dismissing elementls and other summoned beings.<P>Another option would be to introduce a form of multiclassing, perhaps modelled on AA, perhaps not.  That would allow characters to further customize and develop their characters as desired.  Such as system is in place in Horizons, and one like it, or modelled after it, could provide some interesting variety to the game.  Limited in some way, so that characters were perhaps limited to having a maximum of 2 or 3 classes, would allow for more variety and flexibility in group building.<P>Reducing bottlenecks in group forming is becoming increasingly needed in the world of EverQuest.  It is my hope that we will see future enhancements to the game, and the ones I have listed are merely the most rough of sketches, that reduce the need to have a specific class or number of said class in order to deal with content on any level, be it raid or group.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

There isn't much fiddling with should I do this or that just choose and go. I find the biggest problem with getting groups together in eq isn't often a lack of appropriate classes because there are enough generalist to compensate for it. I find the biggest problem is people's attitudes. <P> I mean there is the "We need a cleric". Who cares if there is a druid, shaman, and a paladin in the group. Some people will not group if there is no cleric or risk having a druid healer because of lack of resurrection. Which I can understand to a point, but what are the odds of dying if you are near the zone exit and can't you ask some kind cleric guildie or try your luck with a cleric rezing for donations if needed?<BR> <BR>  There is the I won't group with a warrior as tank and my other favorite I won't group cause there are no tanks. Some people seem unwilling to adapt tactics or go to a location where the group could function without a tank or where the group could get some experience while we wait for a tank to become available. <P>  I think the worse of all are people who refuse to join a group you are starting because you don't have a group. Talk about a catch 22.<BR>  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Its especially bad for very high level charcters who may have spent considerable time and effort building up a charcter, aquiring keys and flags, alternate abilities, and (one hopes) a good in-game reputation.<P>How would the game change if multiclassing were allowed using the following model?<P>* Confined to race/diety restrictions<BR>* Each additional class imposed a progressively steep xp penalty (+10% for the 2nd class, +20% for the 3rd class, +40% for the 4th class, and so on) that applied to all classes and even to AA?<P>You might see more people multiclassing a "fun" class with a "needed" class to improve their group desirability for pickup groups, and this in turn would make group forming easier by spreading key abilities around.  It would make race-choice much more meaningful and interesting.  Races like humans would have a tremendous advantage in terms of the variety of combinations they could make.  Other races such as the frogloks would offer more unique combinations such as a cleric/shaman multiclass, a powerful combination for healing, self-mana regen, and buffs/debuffs.<P>Imagine warrior/cleric multiclasses as main tanks.  Or Cleric/Monk multiclasses (human only) who could feign if a wipe were in progress or if they got aggro.  What about a cleric/necromancer (humans, erudites, gnomes, dark elves) who really is a servant of evil?  The role-play possibilities in certain combinations could be interesting indeed.  Imagine not having to call a raid for a lack of clerics or healing power because 1/2-1/3 of your raid force has some level of cleric in their multiclass.  Imagine being able to form groups in 1/2-1/4 the time or less because its that much easier to find someone with healing ability, or crowd-control ability, or haste or slow?<P>New AA could be added that are race-specific to allow a character to add a class not normally allowed to their race, but is occasionally seen in the game anyway.  Froglok mage or enchanter, or maybe necromancer or shadow knight (if diety restrictions were lifted as a result or diety changes via spending AA were possible).<P>The low level game of EQ is characterized by flexbility in terms of what classes can do.  A low-level ranger tanking at orc1 in the East Commonlands is not unusual, but as the game has progressed into higher levels, the classes have become so specialized in some places, and frankly needed in a several, that lack of class availability can be a problem at times.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I have cleric, druid, necro, chanter, warrior, beatslord, ranger, and mage.

We rocked the house. You just have to be creative. Paci and root from me was the crowd control, the mages healed their own pets most of the time, or just chained them. First adventure I was ever on, CC was a little druid kiting around adds until she could root them. I've had the traditional warrior, cleric, shaman/chanter, dps and they actually did not work as well as some of the less traditional ones. 2 clerics, necro and DPS in MM adventures works pretty well, except I couldn't get the other cleric to nuke instead of melee, so we ran out of time due to lack of DPS. Be creative, and don't just dash off to your adventure as soon as the group is full, Work out tactics ahead of time so everyone is very clear on their role in the group and you should have no problems.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

My point was not to say everyone should do everything, but rather that classes are to an extent overspecialized in some cases, and that can firstly present a problem if you cannot find a needed specialist class LFG.  Players' pidgeon-holeing is also a bad thing, it is based on what I refer to as the "Lemming Principle," namely that people were hear that the game has to be played or approached a certain way, or that doing it a differant way is wrong, stupid, or whatever else.<P>In regards to the latter, I don't have a good answer.  But I know that Lemmings, who are an increasingly populous brand of player in EQ, simply refuse to believe that non-standard groups are possible and/or will attempt them grudgingly and not adapt their methods or listen to the advice of those who have successfully used these approaches.  On a case-by-case basis you can educate people, if they are willing to listen, but it can be difficult to find people willing to listen.<P>The other problem that exists in the current system is its lack of variety, especially in the high end before people start picking AA, and even then people tend to pick and emphasize certain AAs because of their usefulness in a class.  Armor dyes are a nice way to add some uniqueness to your appearance, and the Luclin models have a small amount of flexibility in appearance associated with them.  But in terms of basic power and abilities, there is little room for individuality outside of whatever period exists before someone eventually maxes out their AA anyway.<P>By introducing a system, whatever system it might be, that allows each class to retain its unique special abilities, to be the best in it, but yet allows for a wider range of classes to fill that role when needed, you are not making jacks of all trades, you are instead allowing for a case where adding a second cleric might be done for reasons other than friendship, that second cleric might have make up for a missing slower (say all priests can slow, shamans are far and away the best at it, but clerics and druids can each slow for 50% max at 65) or a lack of a good CC person in a challenging or distant dungeon where you and your friends want to adventure.<P>The point is not to make all classes identical, or have everyone multiclass as warrior/wizard/cleric, but instead widen the bottleneck for absolutely having to have class_X to do task_Y.  Take what was done with druids (giving them heals in the high end, inferior to those of the specialist clerics, but sufficient to allow a group to form and to fill in for missing clerics in a pinch on raids) and expand it to other classes.  Again, how it less important to me than being able to log on, and not have to deal with the combined effect of not having enough of a particular class on, or too many of mine, or the arguments and refusals on the part of the Lemmings who won't group except with tank-healer-slower/cc-dpsx3.<P>I also do not buy that it would result in everyone soloing constantly.  I don't even believe that even if some did use this system to enhance their ability to solo it would necessarily be a bad thing.  Soloing is a perfectly acceptable method of playing an online RPG, and should be a viable form of playing for people who want to get a little xp in before or after a raid, or only have an hour to play or so.  If soloing is something that is so bad, then just make it so the xp per kill, group or solo, regardless of the number of people in the group, is identical.  Groups will kill faster and xp will be better, groups that are able to form faster result in people enjoying the game more because they are playing it, not waiting around and hoping to find enough likeminded people of the right classes, or having to deal with those who refuse to believe you can succeed in non-traditional groups.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

If either gets slow, then enchanters should get half-decent heals, and if they get heals.... blah blah blah, you see where this is going.  I got an idea, if you have no slower, there's something for your extra cleric friend to do.  Ive done LDON 65 missions with a SINGLE cleric where slow was absolutely not necessary.  Not cast once.  I've done SEVERAL 65 adventures where a monk, with less damage mitigation and less hitpoints than a warrior (and NO taunt), was main tank.

For many people in EverQuest, they enjoy raiding and they enjoy their various specialized roles in the raiding world.  Others prefer role-playing, or crafting, or exploring and doing single-group content.  Power level of characters, especially post-60, becomes heavily dependant on gear and AA, and more powerful characters have the capacity to get away with things that would get less powerful characters of the same level flattened.<P>The intent of what I am talking about in tems of class-blending, or multiclassing, or some other means by which key group roles are less confined to a select few classes that can be unavailable when you want to go out and group and have some fun, was not to diminish the role of specialists, or to make everyone into a jack of all trades.  Its meant to specifically address a common problem that players must face in the game: the times when character/class interdependency acts as an impediment to enjoying the game.<P>Speaking as a game master for a tabletop game, I make sure I design content for my players that their configuration of classes and levels can handle.  This is not possible in a game like EQ because its just too difficult to customize content like that on such a wide scale.  In the face of that reality, you want to make sure that someone who chooses a given class because it was good at whatever its role is, remains the preferred choice when people are looking for someone for that role in their group, but you don't want it so restricted that its difficult to impossible to work around not having them present.<P>For example: try going on a raid with 1/4 the normal number of clerics online, and your 3rd string tank being the only one on.  In such a case, it is almost guaranteed that the raid would be cancelled, the fun of said raiders being able to confront the desired raid mob and the challenge it presents cannot happen.<P>This is what I am talking about.  There needs to be a balance among classes not just in terms of group and raid desirability, but also in terms of while having specialists being prefered, not having them so specialized that two is redundant (clerics currently most of the time, with notable and rather amusing exceptions) or that them leaving means that everyone else must likewise end the game for lack of a suitable replacement (something I have had happen to me when I tried to log my cleric off in a PoP grind group before my break - it was made clear that my logging meant the end of the group, and I came away wondering if I was seen as a person, or a resource.)<P>So, the implementation of all of this remains open for a second debate, but the fundamental premise is a sound one: the game should not ever center around the presence or over-abunance/lack thereof, of any class.  Each class should be favored for its designed role, and should have provided the means (either added intrinsic class abilities, AA paths that preclude taking other AA paths, or some form of multiclassing) to contribute to a group outside of their key role if the group has already got someone for it.  This is necessary so that no class is ever "unwanted" and that players are not restricted from being able to enjoy the content of their choice because either they cannot find someone of a key class willing to go, or none are online at all.  In other words, reduce downtime in group building by reducing the need for certain classes and allowing all classes to have 1 main way and a couple secondary ways to significantly contribute to the group.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
