</FONT><HR># 2) All of you "customers" who keep threatening in childish manners that you are leaving... Well, sorry, but, Goodbye... <BR>-The fact is that if the amount of people who leave because of this change, happens... well, that just makes camping MOBs a little bit easier for all the rest of us...<BR>-I hope that you don't leave, but if you do, that is your choice and Verant did not make you do it like you all are implying. #<P>Here's what you fail to understand...<P>It's not about the BP.<P>It's about trust.<P>It's about players trusting Verant to do the right thing by the players, to not flush down the toilet things that players have worked long and hard for, and sacrificed much time/faction/pp/effort to acquire, to make the game continue to be fun and not a worse grind at 50+ than it was at 1-50.<P>Unfortunately, far too many things that Verant has done in the past few months has convinced quite a few players (myself included) that they can't be trusted with that task.  Instead, they have repeatedly pulled the rug out from under the players, ignored player concerns, shown an unwillingness to even come here and discuss a topic in depth even though it is of huge concern to hundreds of posters, and so on and so on.<P>The PoG BP nerf was just the straw that broke the camel's back for a lot of people, because:<P>1.  It was so unnecessary.  The PoG BP does *NOT* suddenly allow people to take on Uber mobs that they couldn't handle before.  At best, it allows them to more easily take on high-greens/low-blues that might have been more difficult without it.  What's so terrible about that?<P>2.  It was done "by decree" (as way too many things are doen by Verant) instead of by discussion with the players.  Instead of saying, "we see this as a problem, what would you consider to be a fair fix", they instead just announced "this is it, deal with it".  And from what was posted by a blue-name earlier, apparently even the warning announcement wouldn't have been made except that Absor decided on his own that the players should know in advance.  Verant as a company just planned to spring it on people unannounced.<P>3.  The lack of feedback.  Hundreds of players are screaming bloody murder, with only a very, very rare person speaking in support, and no one from Verant bothers to try to discuss the matter and persuade people why it was truly necessary -- or even offer their sympathies (yes, a few blue-name posts were made -- no, they are not of the type necessary to indicate that they actually care what the players think or feel -- Abashi's posts in particular seemed way too cavalier).  Instead, we get more of the "we decreed it, deal with it, now why should we even talk to you any more about it" behavior that has been all too common recently.<P>3.  The excuse given for the nerf (that a Cleric/Warrior group could take on any mob that doesn't do more than 300hp/tick damage, and that simply can't be allowed) is downright frightening -- these aren't uber-mobs we're talking about, at 50+ they're high-green/low-blue run-of-the-mill mobs.  The signal that Verant is sending, loud and clear, is that 50+ players will NOT be allowed even to take on single low-blue mobs in a player group made of two people, even with very high-end equipment.<P>EXCUSE ME??  Well, thanks for admitting that the game is supposed to be even HARDER at higher levels than it was in the 30's.  Now that I know that, I'll know not to waste any more time trying to increase my level or equipment, because it won't be allowed to make any real difference, players are not SUPPOSED to get more capability as they advance...<P>I understand that as players get more powerful, so do the mobs, but for pete's sake, Verant is now making it so that while you can solo low-blue mobs at 30, when it comes to the 50+ game, EVEN TWO MAN GROUPS WITH HIGH-END GEAR WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO DO SO WITHOUT NERFS BEING IMPLEMENTED TO PREVENT IT.<P>Someone asked Verant to name ONE mob that puts out less than 300/tick damage whose death at the hands of a two-man 50+ team would somehow ruin the game...   So far, the response has been utter silence, despite the act that this is the very scenario that Verant offerred as the reason why the BP "must" be severely nerfed.<P>I repeat -- this isn't about any given piece of equipment.  It's about trust.  And Verant has lost the trust of a lot of players with their recent chain of ill-thought-out, draconian, fun-crushing changes.<P>Hint for Verant:  Players OUGHT to be able to kick butt at high levels.  That's what people BELIEVE they are working towards when they spend god-knows-how-much time playing this game and advancing their characters.  But your recent changes all seem to enforce the "no butt-kicking allowed' Vision(tm).  Thanks, but if that's truly the case, it's time for us to move on to a game that DOES let us actually become more powerful, instead of more overpowered-by-mobs, as we reach high levels.<P>And it doesn't help that this is right on the heals of a lot of other nerfs, nor that it was done with a "improvements to come later" promise instead of holding off the nerf UNTIL a suitable exchange/make-it-up-enhancement is available.<P>After watching an endless string of what I consider to be mind-bogglingly bad decisions from Verant over the past few months, along with "class balance" lists that look like little more than 5% tweaks on classes that need 50% tweaks, I am convinced that despite promises to actually improve the game if we just keep giving them more time, it's just highly unlikely to actually happen.  Instead, I fully expect things to get worse and worse as The Vision(tm) continues to further diverge from what would actually make this game be one where the vast amounts of time we devote to it will actually have a reward in the end, instead of ever-increasing frustration.<P>That's why people are quitting.  Not because they lost a BP, but because they lost the trust that is necessary to believe that it's worth continuing to play the game.<P>And a note to Verant, if anyone's still bothering to read this -- if you have any hope of turning this around, it'll be by putting Customer Relations FIRST, and your visions of "game balance/challenge" second.  You could have gotten away even with this PoG BP nerf if you had bothered to do it with due respect to the players'<BR> concerns and feelings (including explaining the NEED -- if any -- for the nerf better, then opening a dialog on how it might be fixed, AND finding a way to compensate people who lost a lot of faction/time/pp/whatever to get the BP), instead of just decreeing it and then retreating to your bunkers.  Not to mention the lousy timing.<P>I am constantly astounded not so much by what I see as Verant's poor game decisions (I understand that different people will have different notions of what's best for the game), but what really constantly boggles me is how ham-handedly they spring it on people -- often in the way that seems calculated to generate the MOST hard feelings.  THAT is what generates the most anger, and the biggest loss of trust.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

All it allows, under the best of circumstances (no adds, no fumbles, all the time in the world, etc.) is for a two-man group to take on monsters that are at best low-blue to them (at 50+, practically EVERYTHING hits for over 300HP/tick).<P>Just how "damaging to the game" is that?

</FONT><HR>-- Responding to Rakarth's post --<BR>1) Yes as a matter of fact this BP must be nerfed i agree. <P>I don t know how you all are playing but i spend the last couple days getting XP in seb and i ended calling my PoG BP "BP of boredom" with a little bit of attention u can keep your group healed with it by using it 90% of the time using your mana for emergency heal on enchanter etc... With Clarity 2 and PoG BP sitting and medding is needed after and only after buffing the group ( can even do most of it for cheap with hero bond and naltrons mark / donal s leggs )<BR>-----------------------------------<P>Note that with just celestial healing and a c2, I was able to keep at a constant mana level over several hours in the Chef area with a roughly 55-level party, with very occassional low mana times just after buffs.<P>I don't need the PoG BP to do that.<P>Now WITH the BP what would be different? The party was a cleric, ench, mage, druid, and 2 tanks. If we cut down the tanks, the mobs would take too long to kill. If we lose the ench, we'd get killed on a bad pull. If we lose the druid, we'd have to fight out and be unable to evac on a bad pull. So even with the BP I'd still head in with the same party.<P>So, Verant, please give us specific examples of where using the BP is overpowering compared to what we can do without it.<P>    Blammr 53 cleric of Tunare<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The idea of "class balance" has gotten totally out of hand and will never truly be achieved. This idea of "balance" is diametrically opposed to the existence of the class system -- different classes, different abilities. The *only* way to create a true balance is to eliminate the class system itself. This - obviously - is not going to happen, nor should one want it to. By definition, classes vary and was this not one of the fundamentals of EQ in the beginning ? -- To have classes that depend on each other because one lacks the others abilities? Recent changes have further exacerbated this situation - any increase for one class translates to the reduction of another. For example, all melee types are now as effective as Warriors. This , in essence, makes Warriors less effective since they lack any of the special abilities of a Paladin (LoH), ShadowKnight (Nec. spells), Rangers (Druid spells). How is that "balanced' ? This creates a perpetual motion in which one class gets an increase which requires that , now, another class does as well.<P>Most players accept the metamorphic, "living" nature of EQ in terms of internal game changes, however, the most recent "necessary change for game life" is quite unfathomable. The Cleric quested/dropped BP's have been deemed too "unbalancing" so must be reduced and this merits an almost immediate patch. This is very frustrating  for 2 main reasons : <P>1. These items are extremely rare, from extremely difficult mobs/zones, and extremely difficult to attain -- a player should be rewarded for the effort. Additionally, the players that do have these items are "uber" within their own "uber guild" - roughly translating to a handful across all servers. This does not constitute a "necessary change for game life". A common drop weapon that should be 4dmg 19delay that was accidentally entered into the game as 40dmg 19delay IS a "necessary change for game life" - not a high end, post 50 item. Agreed that these BP's can be exploited but all items similar in nature to these can be and are regularly done so. <BR>2. More emphasis is placed on the eternal "balance quest" and placating individual groups (ex. Giving wizards 2 level 60 unresistable spells - how is that balance ?) than on issues that will be effective to the entire player base. For example, being able to purchase items in bulk from merchants. This is something that will benefit *all* players, but is either ignored or deemed not important. Pathing issues (ex. Faydedar) are another huge item that is consistently overlooked.<P>This post is not meant as a flame, just the frustration of a player who loves the game.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Bah! Class balance is achievable. Even simple games like Asheron's Call have managed to balance the classes (even in a game where a  caster can cast every single spell in the game). <P>The fact that Verant is still trying to balance the game 2 years later is just a sign of poor desing. The game has NOT aged well: 1.) the move from Glide to DX7 was retrograde, 2.) Extending the level cap broke the game, and 3.) SoV totally finished off any semblance of balance for those not in an Uber guild. <P>The current raping of the Cleric class was unwarranted and illogical in the face of SoV mobs. The fact that Verent is now balancing content to the capabilities of multi-group uberguild players is worse than the balance changes made to support PvP. <P>I've already stopped playing AC from the sheer monotony of the game and the fact that Verant always leaves me feeling abused. Looking forward to AO, DAoC, and AC2 here. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan, I like the idea of discussing what will be put onto the changed breastplate, but there is another issue here.<P>The clerics that have this breastplate worked hard with their guilds, have lost faction, and have made sacrifices because of what the breastplate was.  They didn't sacrifice their faction to get the breastplate you're making now-- they did it for the one that you're removing from the game.  Changing it now doesn't change the past and all the time and faction that they've lost.  I don't know what you can do to fix this aspect of the nerf, but it should be looked at.<P>Thanks for reading over the posts.  It looked like you began making a compromise toward replacing the effect on all the breastplates, rather than nerfing the cast time and ceasing the drop...a nerf yes, but better than what you guys originally came up with.<P>Jbwitherss Healson<BR>Cleric of Luclin<BR>--When I lack knowledge, I'll speak with compassion.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First:<BR>     After two years I still am only level 44, so uber items don't effect me much. If you want to make uber items for clerics - give it an effect of a lower level spell of another class, such as Self only Port to somewhere, or Scale of Wolf, Or a self only illusion (wolf form, bear, garou, etc) -- in otherwords, something FUN<P>Secondly:<BR>     THANK YOU for NOT shutting down the discussion after so many people complaining and commenting.  It at least lets us know you are making an effort to listen. To see a blue name commenting on the 3rd section of a long dicussion is encouraging.<P>Third:<BR>     THANK YOU for looking into the "hate" problems - and i am looking forward to the proposed changes.  to quote you:<BR>---------------------------<BR>Anyway, as far as the healing hate stuff on Test goes, here's what's going in:<P>1. The healing-hate cap is being reduced. (less hate max per spell)<BR>2. The calculation of hate is moving a ratio of less than 1:1. In other words, currently if you heal 1000 (assuming the target is over 51), you gain 1000 hate. After the change you'll gain less than 1000 hate.<BR>3. We're fixing a problem with the temporary hate from sitting. Sitting was causing an extraordinary amount of hate making it nigh on impossible to med when in combat.<BR>4. Heal spells assign hate on what we call an "assisted" basis. In other words, any NPC that sees you cast a beneficial spell on their enemy (someone on their hate list) will add hate since they saw you doing that. They do this whether or not they are the primary target. This is why in multiple-attacker scenarios *everything* jumps the cleric as soon as he heals. This is also why everything that's mezed jumps the cleric as soon as mez breaks. We're fixing it so that critters that are mezed or stunned only add enough hate to prevent exploits of mez and stun, rather than the full load they do now when they see you cast a beneficial spell on their enemy.<BR>5. Along the same lines, we're fixing that problem whereby hate lists would propagate across zones. Everyone has been sitting in the dread lands between combat when something ran from half way across the zone to slap your cleric, right? Basically the same thing.<P>That's basically it for what's on test at the moment.<BR>-------------------------------------------<P>Garon Silverfist<BR>44nd Priest of Brell<BR>Co-Guildmaster, Guktofey Trading Company<BR>http://www.guktofey.org<BR>Bertoz Sever</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yikes Absor, <P>You are getting smacked around as much as when Abashi post announced the Manastone Questions.<P>Klem, GET REAL!  If VI had time enough to test every item that much (3 Months and 10,000 Exploits Later) They wouldn't even have time enough to get anything new in this game.<P>Nerfs are a fact of Verant Life (I don't think they should've nerfed this as much when they put in Mobs that can hit in the 100's triple and are only level 30 - EW Dervs anyone?) but when someone figures out how to beat the game, the game really isn't as much fun as it was.<P>Look at paying Taxes (Just a RL example).  We used to have a deduction that you could deduct interest paid on a credit card.  EVERYONE started to buy things on credit cards (Causing a lot of people to have credit problems - Credit card companies were having a ball).  So the IRS NERFED the deduction so we don't have it anymore.<P>This BP became a defining Item.  3 Warriors and 3 Clerics using it could defeat ANYTHING!  So what does the 50+ Game become? A bunch of Warriors and Clerics.  That is just wrong!<P>IMHO - I don't like the Armor quests.  What verant should do is this.  Make A certain zone only drop armor for a certain class.  Make is Phat Lewt!  But make that class useless in that zone.  That way, Verant encourages people to help out their useless friends by going into zones and getting them nice stuff.  Promotes Friendship and grouping.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have said already once in this post. This BP meant less downtime medding for the Cleric. This in it self is the single worst playing problem with the Cleric class. Why should clerics get a spell that we already have better or allow lower lvls to use a spell with the effect they should have to wait for. This will only water the lvls of clerics further such as the epic has done.<P>Naltrons mark, Aegolism, Bullwark of faith should not even be options.<P>GIVE us the bonus of what the BP did for us originally. GIVE US MANA. Make the BP identical to mana robes as for their effects. Anything less is uselss. This is the one effect that will take the stress off of Clerics losing what once was their mana saver.<P>Save the buffs and invisability and other non battle situations for lesser gear. By the way while you are nerfing the BP once again how about giving clerics a tweak for a change and make the arms cast Invis. Maybe your cleric base just deserves something additional after be devostated for the past 6 months.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have to agree with Khalen-Olan on this one.<P>These BPs seem to have been designed (albeit shortsightedly) to reduce downtime, and save clerics mana.<P>Why not put a harvest or manaconvert effect on the new breastplate?  <P>Improved invis, improved invis vs. undead, naltrons mark, aegolism... don't cut it.  They will not help the cleric in a meaningful way, and will not serve as a meaningful reward vs. the risk they have to endure to get the item.<P>It has been stated that you can not put a recast time on an item right now... I would suggest devoting your resources to developing that, because it would save you a TON of headache.<P>Manaconvert is a beneficial spell.  It aggroes mobs; I've seen it happen.  If anything, increase the taunt factor of that spell and make it an effect of the BP.  Heck, increasing the taunt factor of the spell might make it such that manastones and such might be viable in the game again.<P>Or how about a SELF ONLY effect, similar to "Cassindra's Chorus of Clarity," the lvl 32 Bard song that restores mana?<P>This would accomplish the same goal of reduced downtime... but I don't think it'd be overpowering.<P>How about giving clerics a resistable, single target, 1 minute casting time, 30 second duration Silence spell?  Heck, high level casting mobs STILL quad for 300-850+.  <P>These would all be decent alternatives, imo.

</FONT><HR>I really feel sorry for those that got their bp's in pog and now find out they are being nerfed.  Just isn't right.  This seems to follow verants pattern of giving clerics something worthwhile, only to take it away or nerf it.<P>On a positive note, how about the following on a bp from pog.  Mana regen on a sliding scale.  Since you can get into planes at 46, you should be able to use the bp ability, but NOT the same as someone at 60.<P>At level 60 the effect would be half way between clarity and C2.  Each level below 60 would be a fixed percentage lower...how much I'll level up to the math folks to decide.<P>Since this is a self only effect, it won't cut into a chanters territory and C2 will continue to be the preference of all.<P>GreinKnight<BR>Cleric (currently playing his mage for fun)<BR>The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, thank you for responding.  I originally posted the following message in the "Healers" board, and am reposting it here.<P>============<P>I'd be happy if the BP cast a useful buff. Note I define useful as the following:<P>A - One I actually cast regularly.<BR>B - One that does not get superseded by a different buff (ex. Donal's Legs casting Naltron, bah).<P>My suggestions are:<P>A - Bulwark of Faith, 10 sec cast. This is REALLY expensive to cast regularly, but is quite useful overall. Downsides of this being on the BP is it then kills the Aeoglism spell deader than stone since they don't stack. Having a nice fast cast just helps speed things along without unbalancing anything. Reduces downtime and cleric boredom.<BR>B - Aeoglism with peri requirement, 30 sec cast so we don't try to heal with it. Too slow and too small to be used as a heal, especially w the peri requirement. Extremely useful however as an all inclusive buff. Reduces downtime and cleric boredom.  This is one I would really like to see.<BR>C - Divine Aura, very fast (.5 sec) cast time. This would help keep me alive, something to be greatly desired by anyone, but not unbalance the game since it only affects me. Saves my butt in combat, but honestly I don't cast DA very much so not all that useful really.  I would like this better than D or E below, but really this would not be real useful.  Mostly I included this as a concept.<BR>D - Summon Pet, reasonable (5 sec) cast time. This would be amusing more than anything else, but at least we'd use the pet. I does do SOME damage at least.<BR>E - Atone. This is what you put on it if you want to shaft us. Please don't.<BR>F - Some entirely NEW buff.  How about something like "Spirit of the Righteous" which granted the target +10 to AC and all resists, stacks with everything.  Recast 10 secs so is usable on raids and in day-to-day operations.  Lasts 30 min so it doesnt become grossly annoying.  +10 resists is nice, and will be noticable, but isn't so much that it gets out of hand.  It doesn't heal anyone, but would be useful at all times because it is so broad spectrum.<P>The BP should also be retroactively swapped out. Don't leave us, who spent AGES AND AGES getting the current one, having to do it again for another BP. I don't want the current PoS breastplate any longer, give me the new one.<P>You see here's the big problem. Clerics are EXTREMELY pigeonholed as pure healers. Giving us things we use on a reular basis is appropriate. Giving us a spell not in our repertiore is a no-no. So, what applies? Heals and buffs. You don't like the heals, so go with the buffs. I would appreciate an item that cast Bulwark or Aeoglism. Both would be useful. Divine Aura is another option but really isn't very useful - I always have them memorized but the frequency of use? Almost never.  I might cast DA a few times a week, tops.  This ability would suck actually.<P>The Donals and the Velious BP's helped with downtime. Give us a new item that also does so, and please please PLEASE make it retroactive.<P>- Aenae Webspinner<BR>- Depressed and dejected priestess of Luclin<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Suggestions:<P>1) A new HP buff, stackable with symbols, hero, talisman, etc.  200-400 hps, cast time 20 seconds which makes it too long to use in battle as a heal, duration 90 minutes.  Castable on players 45 and higher?  Or self only?  Not enough hps to be overpowered, but enough to make it worth casting.  Did I mention stackable?<P>2) How about DC?  (Clerics get Divine Aura - DA, Divine Barrier - DB, so next in succession should be, um, Divine C... Divine C.. something)  Quick cast time, same basic idea as DA and DB, yet it should leave an icon up for the entire refresh time, after the effect has worn off.  This solves the problem with refresh times on an item.  This idea would take some work and testing, but with the new heal aggro, you have to admit it would be useful.<P>3) Invisibility (or at least Gather Shadows)<P>4) I really like the invisibility idea.<P><BR>Just some ideas from a non-cleric, just slap me if I'm out of line  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>Coffinn Unforgiven<BR>Dark Elf Warlord<BR>Sol Invictus<BR>Tribunal<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OK. Thanks for the explanation, Absor.<P>With the current BP, I can cast one CE every 9 seconds, roughly. So I can cast it on 3 tanks, and get back to the first one roughly as it wears off. Total mana cost: actually negative, as I regain some mana while doing the casting.<P>Without the current BP, I can case one CE every 27 seconds, sitting down and regain the 300 mana it costs (I don't know if this is true, but it's probably close to true -- I know I can regain ~225 mana in 24 secs with just c2.)<P>So the BP allows me to heal one tank in my sleep (I have nothing at all to do the other 16 seconds except melee), or I can keep 3 alive pressing keys a little less quickly than a bard. Without the BP, I can keep one tank alive with a bit more attention (I do have to sit down) and 3 will eventually suck my mana dry.<P>So where do we draw the line? The BP allows keeping 2 tanks alive (maybe with the suggested mana regen component) ? 1.5 tanks? The fundamental problem is of course the mana efficient heals CH and CE -- there's always going to be a combination of state space where as long as I regen enough mana to cast CHs continuously, I can keep the tank alive indefinitely.<P>So, again, where do we draw the line? I agree I do not want the high end game to be boring (with just celestial healing I often am continuously FM -- I am now finding that in normal camps my party members never die any more, as I usually don't run out of mana anymore. This is definitely a change from when I had CompleteH available only. Note that has INCREASED my enjoyment of the game -- less downtime, more loot, and it's still a challenge to keep my mana up during tough battles.)<P>If the BP aids our healing abilities at all, they will be unbalancing to some extent. Even the Donal's arms are unbalancing -- I can use them to heal newbies at zero mana cost to me. So where to draw the line? I buy potions for invis. Having the BP buff will unbalance if the buffs heal at all. If I get some other class's spell, that just seems odd and out of line with the game design.<P>Given that the other classes u"ber BPs don't seem to really add anything to the classes's play other than give good armor and stats perhaps that's what should happen to the cleric BPs in the interests of managing balance. Make them cast some mildly-useful spell like retribution. Now the clerics can do what they always have wanted to do, do more than heal in the battle!<P>Really, I don't have a better suggestion for what definitely seems like an insoluble problem of items with healing effects.<P>    Blammar 53rd vicar of Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, you wrote "I can address the faction issue. There were/are alternate ways to get those items. The faction loss was a choice the player made to get the item one way rather than the other. We won't be changing any factions over this.<P>Exchanges (or perhaps just changing all existing instances of these items) are something that we are reevaluating. When we've come to a decision on what the replacement effect will be, we'll then decide about how to deal with existing items."<P>    How can you say you will not do anything becasue it was the players choice? <P>Take a simple test that will determine the right thing to do. Ask yourself "Would the player make the choice to spend the time or ruin the faction to get the BP if the reward was a BP with a 60 second cast of Celestial Elixer?"  <P>If the answer to that is no (and you know it is bacause you yourself and Abashi both said the BP is worthless now) then you do owe those that risked and sacrificed time and faction to get this item.  To refuse to compensate these individuals is reckless, irresponsible, and flat out wrong.  <P>Even the fact that you concidered this and may be changing your mind due to the increadible flow of objection is totally ashtonishing.  How can you say you have the game's and the player's intrests at heart in one sentence and totally disprove that beyon a showdow of a doubt with a change and total screwing of the people that worked so hard for this in the next sentance?  <P>Can you see how totally whacked that is?  How totally offbase, irresponsilbe, demeaning and wrong that is?  <P>I will never feel safe and secure in the fact that anything I spend my time and effort to obtain will not get nerfed weeks, months or years down the road.
