</FONT><HR>JooJooflop:<P>That was our original theory.  Triton turned the cards in to most every mob in the zone and Soul Assassins did some of the same.<P>Ester:<P>If you are saying we "SHOULD" delete cards then thats about the last thing anyone would ever do.  I dont see what "Deleting" cards changes.  If you are holding 6 cards and by deleting 1 it shouldent be any different then trading that one out of your inventory.<P>However if you put a flag or switch in that when a card is deleted it causes a trigger.  Thats just lame.  You know that nothing whatsoever gives any hint like that in PoM.<P>Please Ester the Tester make your zones more thorough in the future.  Im talking about ST too.  And not just the loot disparity Im talking about the spam and the general linearness to a zone.  If deleting certain cards are the key to getting a new mob to pop that is really out there.<P>There should've been hints given by some of the critters in PoM.  This zone has been SCOURED for clues and the only ones we've gotten are on the boards.<P><BR>Irontail:<P>Perhaps Ester means that we should delete the cards like Jokers?  Cards that dont appear to make any kind of match or pair?  I really have no clue at this point and am quite frustrated as Im sure you are.<P>Or perhaps each card represents a mob /shrug.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

There are a few people in PoM that will say one line responses, but nothing else. every one way wall, every clickable object in the zone has been clicked and done, efforts are now underway to map the entire zone out of boredom and nothing else to do.<P>Just need a word on whether the zone has been fully tested and if it is, great. <BR>(Please have someone other than the Alchemy and Poison testers look into it)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

IT'S a PUZZLE!  Man does no one here remember zork? or Kings Quest games before the mouse came along?  I remember spending 3 days trying to type "get the key from on top of the wardrobe"!!  In a month or so when this zone is spoiled and picked over by all the uber guilds we'll have nothing to think about or talk about again.  I hope every UBER item from the plane of mischief is so goofy looking yet such great stats you have to use it. so you have 60th level uber warrior with a HUGE hot pink feather headdress, or something similar.  Oh the fun they could have with this.  yeah you get +10 wis gloves usable by druids. but they make your hands look bigger than your chest.  or have wild effects like a wand of wonder in d&d you cast, random effect has a % chance to happen. like caster and target switching places. or instead of hurting... you heal your target.  If this is another hack n slash zone for uber folks only it will be a shame. make this the zone to talk about...<P>Kiierun <BR>Druid of the 50th season<BR>Druzzil'Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Ignorant to the point that they do not even bother checking their facts until it is too late.  Every time I see a someone with a Blue name post, it reminds me or the story about the boy who cried wolf.  Verant, you have cried wolf one too many times.

</FONT><HR>Just a really random thought I had while perusing this thread.  I don't know anything about PoM other than it exists, and I certainly haven't seen any of the cards in question, however ...<P>A real deck of cards has 4 SUITS of 13 cards each, and 2 jokers.  Harking back to my misspent youth, it occurs to me that Hoyle's includes jokers as "wild" cards in many games.  If we're gonna go with poker rules, well, a royal flush beats 2 of a kind right?  However, this is EverQuest.  A royal flush might yield the breastplate, while 2 of a kind gets you a bracer.  Jokers are still wild - enabling the player to collect a reward without having the full set of cards.  The different "suits" of cards (if there are such in PoM) would obviously indicate different class armor sets.<P>Like I said, I'm talking out of my *** here, but personally I'd brush up on my poker rules, and ask Bristlebane for a game.  Don't just ask "How about a game of poker" though - I'm sure the guy is quite the "stud" =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have watched Irontaail trying out various card game sayings, on the various people and critters in PoM. It has gotten to the point that he has buttons set up and will run through them on every creature in the zone, then make new buttons and run through again. <P>As far as it just being a puzzle. Ever put a puzzle together and then found out that a piece was missing? Well, the first or second piece is missing and we were just wondering if it is really missing, or is it that 14 people for 3 weeks could not find out one single quest in a zone? <P>What is that saying Akams razor or something? All things being equal, the easiest answer is most likely the correct one.<P>14 people could not find a single clue as to the cards, or it is broken like things have been in the past.<P><BR>Let's just back up and say,(trying to speak for Irontaail too) those people that were in PoM or the ones that are still there are not mad abnout spending the time up there, the zone is visually the best looking and fun zone around, but you can only play on a jungle gym for so long before it begins to get old. If further testing is needed, great, no problem. If player input is needed, cool, ask Irontaail, he is on almost every night and he is still in PoM.(Povar) But, I hafve seen what a let down it has been to go through a LOT of finding things out in the zone to not have anything to show for it. Maybe put a NPC that makes SOME reference to the cards or knights or kings.... the list goes on and on..<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, then modify the rules to make 4 card sets "win".  I did just go read one of the threads on an ezboard dealing with this.<P>I haven't seen the layout of the "chessboard" area, nor have I seen the puppets, but several things come to mind.  Puppet strings, from Cazic, immediatly.  The discussion of King's Court seems interesting as well - although it doesn't seem like anyone's done much digging on that angle.  I found this blurb on a link off a Yahoo search:<P>"The game itself is pretty straightforward. You start out with a 4x4 grid and have a deck of cards on the left of the screen. The goal of the game is to put face cards into the correct spots. You are supposed to put kings in the corners, queens on the sides, jacks on the top and bottom. The rest of the cards can be placed in the middle. You place the cards on the board one at a time. You'll soon realize that you can't just find the face cards and put them where you want them. You have to be strategic about your placing so that when the face cards come up in the deck you can put them where they belong."<P>The following is an explination of the game "Fool's Court", which is described as "an interpretation of the (somewhat unclear) rules for King's Court"<P>"Pieces move like kings in checkers, sliding one space along the corners of the grey squares, or jumping over another piece. If an opponents piece is jumped, then it is captured, otherwise it remains. The player may continue jumping as long as another jump is possible, stopping at any point. Captures are not mandatory. Initially, players cannot jump, they may jump on the turn after the second player has made a second slide. After the first players move, the second player must slide a piece from the opposite side of the board. After the first two slides, each player must keep at least one piece in the center court (blue area) at all times. If a player's last piece in the court is captured, that player loses the game."<P>Granted, that doesn't exactly explain the game, but I'm sure someone with a vested interest could spend more time looking for a better explination of how to play.  Maybe you challenge Bristlebane, and use charm to move the numbered mobs on the board.  That would certainly make enchanters useful somewhere in Vellious =P  It would also explain why some mobs can be solo'd by a melee cleric - if they were designed to be somewhat "willing" pawns in a giant board game, Verant would want to allow players a chance to recharm their pieces.<P>The trigger remains the big question though - how do you get Bristlebane (or someone) to want to play with you?  The only other obstacle is getting enough enchanters there to charm the team's pieces .. although with creative use of mem blur, one could be enough I suppose.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Maybe it is broken, maybe it isn't.  Just because a whole 14 people have been there and couldn't figure out the puzzle, doesn't mean the puzzle is broken.  How difficult would it be to devise a puzzle that might be beyond the intellectual capacity of the majority of EQ players?  Not that hard I'll bet.  As some of you have pointed out, it seems like a lot of people want an answer out of Verant but at the same time wouldn't believe a single word they might say.<P>If whoever is still up there wants to keep trying, I will cheer them on.  If they finally get bored and leave, the plane will still be there when they want to try again, or someone else smarter wants to take a crack at it.<P>The 'combined efforts' of everyone on the message boards probably is pointless.  There could very well be some feature in the plane (landscape, item, NPC speeches), some detail that is a vital clue to the puzzle.  Perhaps there are a bunch of these important details.  But only 14 people have even had a chance to see them.  Irontaill, for all his valiant efforts, might simply be dismissing something as unimportant that is actually essential to the solution.  We have no way of knowing, since we can't go there with him.<P>Verant, IF it is broken, please fix it.<BR>IF it is working and no one has figured it out yet, then I congratulate you on a job well done.  It takes guts to put something out there that demands some intellectual prowess from your players, something that perhaps only a small percentage are even capable of accomplishing.<P>I'd love to be able to get there before it is cracked.  I love puzzles.  I'm horrible at them, and would probably leave scratching my head, but it would be fun to just explore the possibilities.  I expect someone a lot smarter than me or the rest of us will eventually figure it out.<P>And you know what?  Fumadil is right.  If the puzzle is at all well-designed, we will all say the same thing when the solution is revealed:<P>"DOH!  Why didn't I think of that??"<P>Good luck.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Fabmatil, do you find it odd that on two different servers the PoM has been reached and that no one out of either group has managed to wither figure out or do whatever it takes to get ONE single piece of "l3wt"? <P>All things being equal, the easiest answer must be the correct one. The zone is broken.<P>If there were no such things as broken quests, if there was never Alchemy, if there were not STILL broken quests in the explored area of the game, this question would not be asked. We would assume that everything was working just fine. If it isn't, just say so. No one will be angry, (that I know of) they would just like a person to go up and physically do the quests without summoning the items.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi all 8-)<P>just updating some ... 3 color cards are dropping. Blue, Red and Black. The types of cards are Squire (common), Knights(Rare), Crown (very rare only on Red to 60 lvl NPCS), and a non-color Jester card (very Rare on Red to 60 NPC's). The Cards are LORE but tradable. I have off loaded some out of POM np. They dont seem to have an effect out of POM, but of course we have not turned them in or tried doing much out of POM with them.<P>We have tried to turn them in to every NPC in the zone in all major combinations we could find ... ie.. 1 of each color and jester, 1 or each kind and jester. After we give the NPC the cards .. we kill them if no response ... and they have the cards on them. This normally indicates that the NPC in question does not want the cards ... for example if you give a quest guy 1 piece of a quest he is handing out (not no-drop items) and then kill him. He wont have the item on him, but if you give an NPC a quest item that he doesnt want .. and kill him, he will have the item on him. This only works for NON no-drop items. So as we have given the cards to every NPC in the zone EXCEPT Bristlebane, and then killed them ... it would seem that giving the cards is not the answer.<P>PS. Bristlebane shows up at 9am game time every game day for exactly 5 SECONDS!!! then despawns unless you attack him ... even then if he's not under constant fight .. he despawns .. thus we have not given the cards to him ... and not quite sure we could. For example .. I hit him .. move him around and FD .. he immediately despawns . 8-(<P>There is no faction at all (except the black horse) in the entire zone. So killing things has has no real effect that we can see. Almost all NPC's are at a static spawn point with the exception of 3 or 4 and as such (Im a monk) I can hit them, kill for a bit and FD .. then stand right back up and they are not Agro, because they reset right away.<P>Unfortunatley I no longer have a Rogue up here to try Thieves Cant speach or pickpocketing. All other players from Triton (except 2 .. myself and Adaru - Cleric) have given up on the plane and left. As far as I know 3 other guilds made it up here and after 2 weeks of searching also have left. I do have beg and have tried on some of the NPC's, but alas .. it takes huge time. There are alot of NPS's up here and beg does not work fast, but as I have not completely tried that, I will start.<P>As far as destroying the cards ... at this point in the last month I have only received 1 new Crown card and 3 Knights (all cards are fairly rare) and no New Jesters (we only have 2 from when Triton was up here and they come off NPC's that I can no longer kill solo with 1 Cleric), so I really dont want to delete them ... hehe.<P>I play 4 hours a day in POM trying new ideas and collecting cards. Exp is actually not to bad. I have gained 1 entire lvl up here. Some Blu's I can actually solo. The easy Blu's in the forest are about equal to Drolvarg's in Karnor, some you can solo .. some you cant (From a monks point of view). All other NPC's I have to solo pull (FD) and then it takes an entire bar of Complete Heals and Mark of Karn to  kill. I have about a 90% success rate. But Due to the high exp and the fact that Adaru is bound up here and the NPC's are not on a faction system, we have been able to always rez back in.<P>Im of the opinion that maybe the zone is working ... I hate to say that, but maybe we just have not done the right thing. I appreciate that 3 "BLUE" named ppl have at least looked at this thread, and thank them for doing so.<P>Alas, I fear that maybe we HAD done something right in the past, but maybe it was patched after we tried, so what we tried b4 and didnt work, might actually work now, but we would not know it 8-(<P>Ive tried to do everything that someone has suggested .. but to no avail so far. My guild and leader of Triton (Zaar) have been very patient with me up here, and I try to help out the guild with my Alts, but I have missed many raids and 2 VP raids ... Zaar comes on every day and says .. when are you comming down!! ... hehe. Im thankful to Zaar that he has as much understanding as he has so far ...<P>fyi ... As far as a Rogue dragging a body to COH ppl in ... Im not sure that works here any more. Giantt (Triton Officer, winner of ToT2 on Povar) is the one who deserves the credit for finding POM, as well as showing me how to check for things in POM.<P>We search for things and EVERY INCH of POM has been searched this way, by clicking in a very slow manner up and down each wall, ceiling and floor. When you get near something that does anything ... it starts to say ... you are to far away to click it .. ie something is there. This has some side effects like sometimes your on the opposite side of a wall to something that can be found. With the exception of a picture in the right balcony room everything has been found or explained. The right balcony says something is on the picture, but nothing seems to happen ... we feel it might be a case where the design layout is on the opposide of the wall, even though it's not accurate to mapping.<P>Hope this helps a lil, fyi .. most NPC's and maps have been documented on the www.tritonguild.com website under message board. Summers (Pally in Triton) has put up a huge set of pictures to most the NPC's in PoM. I'll get the links and post them next message. But they can b found on the www.tritonguild.com message board, as well as some animations I did from the dancing Sphinx's.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
