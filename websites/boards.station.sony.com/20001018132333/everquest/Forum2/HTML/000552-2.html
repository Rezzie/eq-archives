</FONT><HR> We do have one questionable transfer from Test that being a level 60 Wizard named Kelzor, who also has a level 57+ necromancer named Kelzors. both have displayed some rather unuasual abilities such as tracking, returning with full mana after a PvP death, running at insane speeds, and hopping from one side of the zone to the other in the blink of an eye. Its commonly believed this guy is using some serious cheats but wether its something he learned on test or not is unknown. We would appreciate any gm's reading this to look into the guys activeties.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Yeah the GM's have been told about this guy Kelzors.  He has been seen by a bunch of people running faster than a GM runs.  It is so obvious that this guy is cheating.  When is Verant going to do something about this?  All they need to do is watch him run its so obvious.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>yea there is something going on with that guy.../ponder ... btw i play a light as my main ...and the power shift is fine... whatever goes... the thing that really gets me is it is harder for you to level as a light (or it was atleast when i started playing the server almost 10 months ago (pickclaw warrior group lists were in the upper teens and unless you were a good soloing class that was one of the few places u could fight) there was even tons of people all lined up at dwarves in BB, and the barbarians in WK, bout now all the lights are starting to hit 50 and rocket on up there... the only thing that pisses me off bout the move is us ppl who have been on the server a while had too work harder to get what ppl that played on test could accomplish faster in the same ammount of time... so yea im whineing hehe ...if verant is reading this i have a couple characters that are begging to have a item wipe on there server(s) and get moved to tallon B-) </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ya kelzors, sheesh i get splurted at Sro/innothule zone, gate immediately to the Sro/ Oasis side of Sro (entire encounter taking place in Sro) i sit and wait to die as being an enchanter and splurted I'm dead. Well splurt had me down to one 1 bubble of health and i read "kelzors begins to cast a spell" beams a smile at me i'm dead off his lifetap ok how fast does Splurt tear away 900hps? and how long does it take to run completely across Sro and cast a life tap to get the kill shot? hmm figure that out and you'll get an idea of how fast this guys is trucking. Kelzors is running at Mach speed. And yes I agree the spontaneous birth of 3 50+ lights does impact our server.  All the level 50s know who eachother are and if the lighties were the LA Lakers, well they just signed 3 of Shaq's long lost brothers. Highlevels on our server upon entry to ANY zone check for killable pcs or potentially troublesome PCs.  Hence everyone on our server hunts, xps, camps, whatever with an added risk not present in test or blue servers. They were able to level in a Hassle free environment without the pvp interuption. I've logged over 70 days, my enchanter is 51. Had i been blue server raised i'd be 60 without a doubt.  Why do they get that luxury? People who played test were warned it was not a "normal server" and that drastic changes could be made at any time. Hey they signed up for test, i think they should be bound to test.  Very unfair in my opinion. But since Verant has allowed server transfers, I think they should be more should take a harder look at what they do when they drop such characters into an established environment. My suggestion would to have them relocated to a blue server or one of the new split servers where their presence would be less detrimental to the server's environment. If they want PvP they should start at homeplate level 1 like all the other PvPers on TZ.  I'd like to see a Verant Response to this issue at the bare minimum. I hope with much optimism someone at Verant read this thread and understand where we are coming from with this thread.  <P>   Chezzlin    <P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>A post regarding the Necromancer that you ran into.  I would bet any amount of money that Necro was named Kelzors.  Level 57ish Erudite Necro. (He also has a lvl 60 wizard named Kelzor) I have witnessed myself, along with MANY others, how "fast" he runs.  As for the Full mana/bone chip issue, I dunno.  I've run into this guy several times.  Each time, he runs faster then I've ever seen a player move.  <P>A group of 6 of us caught him at sro/oasis zone.  We engaged him.  He ran, like any smart player facing 6 high level characters would.  We all had SoW.. No granted, he may have had SoW as well, But theres no way in hell to run as fast as he did.  He was out of the desert portion of Sro before we got to the top of the hill at oasis/sro.  Is that possible?<P>Perhaps with a bard its near possible, But he was alone.  We petitioned that he had some sorta game hack, and like yourself, a apprentice guide said he'd pass it on.<P>Why is this guy not getting in trouble?  <P>Wait wait, Lemme pull a thread that was posted on Tallon Zek Times, a tz message board.. <P>People were trying to figure out if gordon played on TZ.. and alot of people pointed fingers to Kelzors... Perhaps thats why this player hasnt gotten in trouble for his ability to run faster then bard speed sounds.  <P>As for the other test server players, I have seen nothing special, ran into a gnome warrior, lvl 55ish wearing full crafted and some SSOy's.. prolly just hand-me-downs from higher players in his guild.  But he died just as any other player would with no special abilities.  <P>But for this Kelzors guy, he definatly has abilities the rest of the players do not have, nor can even comprehend.  <P>Anyone care to explain?  Why is this necro, that oh-so-many people have witnessed with a 'special' ability to run fast, not gotten into any trouble, yet, uses this exploit at a daily basis?<P>Verion Di'nino<BR>"A curious old timer of Tallon Zek."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well, don't know if this is what happened, but after looking at the post 50 necro spells, this would be my guess.  Immediately after respawning, this necro casts lich, which exchanges 32 hps for 20 pts of mana per tick.  During this time he can root a wandering mob and cast various forms of the lifespike spell to regain the hps he is losing extremely quickly.  He then casts levant, a level 55 necro spell that transports the necro across the zone.  (Levant will teleport the caster to the zone entrance, or any major feature within the zone.  For example in NK you could levant to the stone bridge zone point, the wooden bridge zone point, the EK zone, the wizard spires or the druid circle).  Most likely he still has lich running, so at this point he can root another mob and cast another hp drain.  Very rapidly he has plenty of mana with which to take down a solo, unprepared opponent.  Now, whether he did this, or some other combination, I don't think its horribly unlikely that he did it without cheating.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000552-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000552.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=000552&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=000552&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
