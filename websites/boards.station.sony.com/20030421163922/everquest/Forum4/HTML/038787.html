And am I the only one who thinks that takes away from the game??<P>I mean, maybe not for the experience of your toon.  Obviously your toon is going to get its ***  kicked and trashed and killed a few times, but for the gamer themself.  I know this huge portion of lower level characters who have this amazing amount armor on them.  I mean, like way more than what a newbie should have IMHO and they tend to think they can take on anything, and often survive, so they don't really LEARN that maybe 2 elite gnolls at lvl 9 is not the smartest idea.<P>I dunno, maybe I'm just not getting into the true "Lets level fast" spirit, but I think you kinda have to earn your armor.  I don't think you're doing yourself any favors by getting twinked out early in the game.  What if, by some bad stroke of ill luck, you find yourself suddenly naked at your bind point and have to make it back to your corpse.  Sure you have the skill, but do you know what you should and shouldn't take on without conning and without all that uber gear to protect you?  I mean, last night in a group of 5, the 3 lower levels got killed a good 5-6 times, despite the fact that we were trying to protect them and they were all twinked out.  The majority of those times were as they were trying to get their corpses back.  My character generally has a relative motley of armor on, some passed down, some won, some made.  Nothing exciting, but it works for me and I solo most of the time.  I think I faired the best last night, didn't die at all and knew my limits when it came what to take on.  I dunno, am I making any sense here?<P>I just think it takes away from the fun of the gaming experience if you can kill everything or survive every attack right away.  I mean, yeah, we all bitch about having to go get our corpses back, but sometimes thats just as much fun as the fight.  And plus, bonus points for getting xp in YOUR HEAD and not just for your toon.  Maybe next time you WON'T take on the guy who cons red.<P>Does this make sense to anyone else or am I rambling?  And if you're going to preach to me about the "perks" of extremely expensive, often times heavy and oh-so-necessary uber gear you can do us all a favor and save it.  Thats all some of the people on EQ I know live for(that and pp) and I've heard the song and dance routine several times.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

(assuming they are twinked at all)<BR>They'll train crushbone at level 9, Karnor's in 50s and the Planes in their 60s. More often than not they'll also be guildless. (for obvious reasons)<P>I, too, feel sorry for the new player who sees you killing 3-4 mobs at once and he dies to a single one, but I can assure you many people would have quit if it wasnt for twinking. (Starting from nothing and building up a char with low level quests isn't fun for everyone - I'd never start an alt without being able to twink/PL him, I just don't enjoy spending an other 50hrs in pickup groups when I can get him to 40 within a few hours)<BR>COnsidering how many alts are twinked many players seem to agree with my. Why put level requirements on *every* item to please a minority and not change anything at all? <BR>(unless you nerf group buffs, AE buffs and healing players that con green to you PLing will still happen.

In regards to Twinking.<P>I was not a Twink.<P>I was only a Level 5 Shadow Knight running with an Ashenbone Shield and a MoSS. &lt;mischevious grin&gt;<P>But the truth behind that is more interesting.  My orginal account got banned due to some cr@p my former Guild Leader pulled and screwed me over with; after I worked my @ss off to save her Guild from extinction when she decided to goplay DAoC for 4 months after it first came out and not tell us about it.  She just assumed I was going to take over her Guild and not give it back to her and that we all had plans to run her out for good.<P>Anyway... after all that bitterness was done and over with, she goes and screws me over, and gets me banned.  <P>Took me almost a month to decide whether I was going to come back to EQ, as I had everything originally and was close to acquiring my first Epic even.  <P>When I did return to EQ, all my friends had gone up another 20 levels and were out killing uber mobs and getting phat lewt and whatnot...  I tried out a few new character's for a week... got bored and was about to quit for good when a few friends decided to take a break from all their uber raiding and come visit me again.  They gave me money; 1200pp total, and some nice, mid-grade gear.  I was level 5 at the time on my new Main.<P>A day later; the Centi-Longsword was discovered on Luclin, and the East Commons trader economy went to heck over it.  With in twenty four hours the price of the MoSS dropped 75%.  So I bought one.<P>That same night, I was passing through Kith and a Guild was raiding for the rogue epic, and asked if I wanted a new shield, the Ashenbone.<P>The rest of my gear, such as all the Crusty Armor I got at level 20, I got from selling Medium Quality Pelts and Skins, which sold for around 5pp a piece, which usually brought me 200pp a night.  Sometimes I wonder why, at my level now (50), I don't go back to the Commons and start farming those pelts again... <I>/em sighs</I> Guess I just feel guilty going after newbie mobs and taking away from the newbie's fun.<P>So.. no, I was not a twink. <P>I earned everything I have.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

There's always <I>something</I> that can kill you, regardless of your gear.<P>Look, this is a game.  It is designed with risks and rewards.  It's only natural that people will try to minimize the risks.  The easiest way to do that (and still level) is through equipment upgrades.  Most people agree that dying and losing hard-earned experience isn't fun.  Therefore, not dying is more fun.  In other words, twinking makes Everquest more fun to play for most people.<P>I don't believe that the majority of twinks are newbs who don't know how to play.  Yes, there are some who were given equipment by friends or guildies and who don't know their characters well.  So what?  Their dying doesn't hurt you.  Their trains might, but I've been trained by more true newbies than by twinks, many times over.<P>My main is level 35 and you bet I twink my alts with plat and gear.  I figure I earned it, as I got him to where he is without anybody's help.<P>What's the difference between joining a guild and getting equipment upgrades from them, and having a main twink your alts?  None that I can see.  Are you going to argue that guilds shouldn't distribute gear to their members?  That would kinda defeat the purpose, wouldn't it?<P>If it makes you feel any better Silvyre, I started a brand-new Bard yesterday.  He's level 5 now and got there with just his guild tunic and short sword.  I completed two of the Freeport Bard newbie armor quests with him so he's got platemail helm and boots.  No twinkage (yet).  As long has he remains <I>fun to play</I> he'll stay untwinked, but if playing him becomes a chore... Twink!<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Each quest would be doable only once by a character.<P>Everquest, not Evergrind.<P>Moreso, you would need to find a way to eliminate the camping of mobs, for needed drops or flags.<P>Everquest, not Evercamp.<P>What I am struggling to understand is that why you care so much about characters with which you have absolutely zero interaction?  The ones who do nothing to distract or detract from anyone else's enjoyment of the game.  And they far outweigh the noisy, brash ones who would be idiots, twinked or not.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

But I'm now convinced that in modern-day EQ, you have to twink if you're a melee or hybrid class.<P>My main is a caster, so I wanted to make some kind of hack-and-slash character for my alt.  I went with dwarven warrior, and didn't twink him at ALL.  No connection whatsoever between the two.  And the little dwarven guy worked hard at making his own way -- by lev 20 he'd managed to get himself a full suit of crafted armor (upgrade over newbie) and a Centi SS and Centi Warhammer.  I was all psyched.<P>Then the fun went out of it in two nights.  First one, was fighting outside the sarnak fortress in LOIO, and the group cleric complained up and down the whole time about how much damage I was taking, saying "warriors are worse than monks".  Next night, duoed with a ranger in NL.  He's wielding a Wurmslayer and Centi LS, and easily outdamaging me 3-to-1.  Oh and HE'S the one tanking with his fancy armor, clearly taking much less damage than me.<P>And that was it, I mothballed the warrior and started a new twinky alt.  I suppose if you have a thick skin and no worries about how well you're actually performing, you can continue on the true untwinked path, and I'm rooting for you.  But you can't remotely hold your own as a melee or hybrid class past the lowest levels until you twink pretty significantly.<P>Personally, I'd love a recommended or required level on most items.  As you can see, my attitude is that twinking is a necessary evil, and I'd just as soon do without it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Most of the time its stupidity and self-inflicted, but a good portion of the time its due to twinked out newbs to take on too much and dump em on me when they can't handle it anymore.  I KNOW my limits.  I KNOW what I should and shouldn't take on given my class, skill, etc.  I pay attention to that little sign that says "You have gotten better at Defense" or "You have gotten better at 1HS" and conning is a habit, not a chore.<P>I'm trying to learn 2 HS right now and have a big ***  axe I'm using.  Did I jump right into BB and tackle elites?  No.  I stayed in QH and tackled some bugs, rats,skellies, etc until I was sure I could handle myself, then just took on scrawnies and gnolls singly because I didn't have the stamina to do several pulls. I knew my limits, but a lot of people don't.<P>MY original post was not meant to be a flame, just an observation.  Everyone has different goals and preferences for the game.  If you think you need all that uber gear to have a good time, all the more power to you.  I personally think the smarter way to go is earn your gear as you go along and not get britches too big for your rear too early, but thats me.  *shrug* EQ is made up of different people who have different preferences, whatever you like is whatever you like.  Obviously, I won't change your opinion and you jumping down my throat and calling me a troll certainly won't make me change mine.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I was referring to those desiring a recommended level put on uber twink items.  People pulling stuff onto you is apparently your 'issue' not twinking.  Newbies is what is causing those bad pulls, or oldies under level 10 wishing a quick return to their bind with equipment.  Uber gear is not to blame for poor players.  Poor players can be twinks or anti-twinks.  Blaming poor player behavior all on the twinks is wrong to do.  I would be more justified in blaming anti-twinks for being poor players since the majority of newbies are not twinked and die all the time.  I agree that there might be some ubers out there that do not know how to play outside their mains normal play style, and twink their alts and the side effects might lead to trains, but guess what.  They are new to the class as is anyone with a level 9 alt pulling in blackburrow.  They are as much as a liability as the next newbie.  This is why leveling up past the easy levels is so important.  Getting away from the 'newbie' crowds and into the more skill based zones will filter out a lot of those that do not know how to play their class.<P>Attacking gear is the same as demanding a nerf to a class.  The class that the anti-twinks are calling out to nerf is the twink class, which as a wealthy merchant I enjoy playing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

This like someone who wants the world to think and do what they want and not what the other person or country wants. The is a friggin game folks. It is one HUGE game. Your NOT the only one playing it and the zones are big enough for all of us to play in with out this sort of garbage. Other than official rules and the "un-official" ones too, no one has the right to tell me what I can or cannot do with my character. No ONE!<P> I pay my lowly $12.95 per month like any else and I'll play they game as I see fit. None of my characters are "tweaked" and if I had the plat, I would upgrade my armor and weapons to help me survive. "Survive" and not nuke an npc or monster. <P> I have seen this argument on every game I have ever played, someone doesnt like this, someone doesnt like that, THEY should not be allowed to do this or that because "I" wouldn't do it or would allow it if "I" ran the game. Thank goodness none of you do. Maybe you should petition Congress to pass a law to make it "illegal" to tweak your characters. That would be about you level of mentality.<P> Each and everyone has a right to his or her opinion and they have the right to play the game as they see fit as long as they do not "ks" or cause problems with others around them. But if the person who is "tweaked" is not interfering with your gameplay and or stealing loot ot kills from you and or causing you to be killed from "trains" then What does it matter?<P> I have seen guilds help guildmates with tweaks so they may get to a level to join them on raids and quests. Now should the guilds be forced against their will to obey your "logic" and how "YOU" would play?  Sorry doesn't work that way Thank goodness.<P> I have seen tweaked characters and I have no problem with this. If this how they wish to play and it is enjoyable to them and it does not violate and rules or causes me any problems...then let them. It is their money, and if is what they want and like to do..Then who the heck are you to deny them this.<P> By your logic then, The latest game "Tweaks" should not be allowed. Why should a necro be allowed to research Cleric spells? Hmm? Well? Where is the protest? No? Gee I wonder why?<P> It is like a kid seeing a younger kid with better toys than him. by your reasoning, his daddy should not be allowed to buy him better toys because you dont have it or want that toy.<P> If your playing the game and are paying attention to what you are doing, why is it that you have time to notice that this one or that is  doing or if they are truly tweaked? Care to answer that? Do you go around and check the characters to see if they are tweaked? Seems like a full time job to me? So when do you have time to play the game? Gosh that means that in single player games the same logic applies, your lowly lvl 5 character should not be allowed to buy or if found off of a monster drop, be allowed to use the better armor and or weapon. And it also means that No one can help out a lower lvl character, by being nice to them by giving them armor or weapons they no longer use and the lower lvl could not afford. So now we take away kindness even in gameplay.<P> Gee what is next, characters will have to show id's to prove they can buy something? Do me a favor, quit trying to ruin the game for me and leave. go some where else or play single player games and play alll you want the way you want.<P> Or better yet, Go into Politics and or <BR>Religion and try to shove your opinions down everyone elses throat and try to convince the world "your way" is the only way. <P> Sorry, I dont like Whiners and little Dictators who must control everything or everybody because they are under some delusion that they know what is best and everyone will "like" what they will force them to do or take away from them. I normally ignore this type of tripe, But the comments I read just stuck me in the **s and I could not ignore it. <P>  Just play the game and enjoy it, The game has enough idiots who cause problems with bad attitudes and rudeness, don't try and take away something just because you do not like it or play it that way. OK?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/wink.gif"> <P> Just ignore the others and stay with those who you enjoy gaming with. That is what I do. I found it much more rewarding than worrying if that guy or that girl is tweaked better than me. Sorry, I'll get off my soapbox and let those who will flame me do so. As grandma always said "Whatever blows yer skirt up" <P> Let the Flaming Begin!<P><BR>ps I do not and have not single out anyone, nor do i believe that it is right to do so. As I said; any and all have the right to express their opinions.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/wink.gif"> Just dont expect the rest of the world to agree with you.<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
