</FONT><HR>First off id laike to say im not just ranting about my main charcter..iv had 4 charcters over lvl 40 and i love them all i think you guys have done a great job of balanceing them..but my favorite is my necro but thats all changeing  in the post 50 world of EQ ..necros are deemed..in my opinion the kings of pain .. where not healers..where not buffers.. we make things suffer.. and although this may sound like a rant really i mean this as a question..at what point is our debt paid back for the soloing ability we are givin?  ive been chased harrased and killed by about every npc roaming the game...ive had to hit the ground runnning after being evaced to a hostile location ..and paid outrageouse amounts of money for food ect that many people take for granted and lord only knows the loot ive left behind becuase of no selling/banking in the area..all this i  take in stride because i consider part of the ROLE of a evil class.<BR>My beef is why are we asked to "change our role" in the later lvls and become a mana battery? i dont see this in any other class ..clerics heal from  early lvs to late lvls..tanks  tank the whole time..buffers buff ..necros suddenly lose there luster after 50..not alot to solo after 50(imean solo as in get ebtter /faster exp alone rather than grouped) heres my suggestion love it or hate it i want to be the king of pain i started this charcter for one thing we DO NOT NEED is more damage that would make us better at soloing lord knows we are a very balanced class...but i feel that after the kunark expansion the "necros are blanced thing" kinda got us over looked ..the game changes after 50...drastically<BR>So whats wrong with a few nice group buffs...nothing that we could use on our pets to mek them better.. but things people would like to have... heres a couple ideas  id just like to throw out so you know the lines along wich im thinking i understand some of this is not doable for many reasons i havent considerd  but please consider the reasons im dropping them your way as well<BR>1. how about another dmf style buff all maybe call it dead man walking..give infravision, a very nice resist to desease bonus, and ??. maybe alow the person its cast on to have a weapon proc of some desease based spell nothing major but something to make people think "hey cool im procing something"<BR>2 how about makeing our vampiric embrace spell something we could put on someone else.. not something that would tap for huge amounts of hp but something there again that would make us look more attractive.<BR>3how about a group invis undead...druids can do it with sow bard with invis...<BR>4maybe allow us a spell with the potencey of say allure of death that could be cast on another player..this wouldnt hold a candle to  even normal clarity but  if an enchanter wasnt present it would beb beter than nothing.<BR>5 how about some sort of  call of bones spell where we take the HP hit..and someone else gets  a cut of our extra mana ?..leaveing us with something to cast with?<P>you compared what a necro does for casters with what a cleric does with tanks in one post...im sorry but there is excitement in healing people..saveing them  and after all its the role they hired on for at lvl 1  sitting thru fight after fight only to toss all your mana to someone  raid after raid jsut isnt much fun and not what a "necro" would be doing  doesnt it make since that someone whos spent years dabbling with death could find some way to share the power/ knowledge of his efforts with those he chose to allie with?...instead of  sitting in a corner only to pass mana  once in a while<P><BR>Any way please before you pass this over and say necros are fine if we do anything we will make them to powerful...stop and relize  we can be made more group friendly without makeing us any more powerful...im sorry but i can not see why anyone can tell us our roll after 50 changes  no other class is expected to do this..and despite how you may feel this only applies to the BIG battles it does not ..it seems to be a growing trend every group i get in im asked to "pump" for a enchanter/wizzy/cleric ..i think the mana transfer spell is a great idea it has saved hours in resurection time on dragon hunts that go badly ...but its just not fair to kill the ROLE of any class after a certain lvl<BR> ive never posted here for a reason ive always been please with the game as it was..ive had a lvl 48 enchanter 45 rogue  52druid   and countless other classes since phase 3 of beta but not until my post 50  game with my necro have i gotten un satisfied with any class<P>please excue the spelling /grammer lol been up late and  dont feel like looking it over to see my mistakes hehe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The problem with all these necro posts is they do not look at the big picture.<BR> <BR>Enchanters are great in groups. They have a lot of great grouping abilities. But until they hit level 29 they are not wanted much in groups. Enchanters have to struggle all the way to level 50. They cannot solo worth sh*t and before they have all those cool spells everybody wants they are shrugged off. This is why so many enchanters quit in early levels - they are not wanted in groups and yet they cannot SOLO. For the abilitiy to be wanted in groups post 50 they have to *PAY* and PAY dearly by having to struggle through all the early levels.<BR> <BR>Necros can cake walk to level 50. They get a pet that kicks ass and takes names. For the ability to SOLO so effectively thay are WEAK in the grouping area. *THIS* is the TRADEOFF which Necros do not comprende.<BR> <BR>You want to be wanted in groups play an Enchanter. You want to solo to level 50 be a NECRO. Don't expect to have a cakewalk to level 50 when so many OTHER classes have to struggle so hard and just be GIVEN certain abilities that others classes have died for and spend countless hours struggling for.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is just my opinion..and im the first to say it may be worng theres tons that go into keeping this game plugging along  but i cant but feel the necros are fine thing kindas deluted what they done for us in the 51+ game  the spells are a smattering of nice and never used ..we see them every day twinking on the melle classes 51+ game and doing a few things here and there over all but i wonder if the necros are fine thing still rules there opinion of the necromancer..?<BR> when chooseing a group the necromancer is the last choice on raids..and lets face it nearly everything after 51 is a raid oif some sort..sure if theres a slot to fill we may get it but if theres an odd number of people we get left hanging out to dry<P>the only thing i really hate is when people tell me its the price i have to pay lol been paying in soo many ways since lvl 1  and now the price requires i have to stop being a necro to be a necro ..what irony =)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Just takes a Chanter worth their salt.<P>Onto fixing Necros in epic situations/raids...<P>1) I like the dot-subversion idea. If a necromancer could cast a Mana transfer spell on someone else and have its effect take as long as a regular dot, and give a better ratio than the current Subversion series it would be well recieved. Have the spell cost maybe 350mana and transfer about 250 to target.<P>2) Epic weapon? 9 seconds is too long, sorry. But way to go on the Root/Snare patch. =)<P>3) Upgrade to DMF would be nice.. not necessarily stacking or that powerful.. something good.<P>4) Holy smokes, those are the only ideas i agree with.<P>56 Necromancer *take a bow*<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Cabriolet yours is the point I have  most to say about listen to what your saying ..you paid your dues to be wanted by 50+ groups .. i agree 100% you guys rock at high lvls you struggled thru the tuff times and your enjoying your reward ..<P>Necros.. we solo great at low lvls ...we also are killed on sight most places  pass up loot and pass up sales of what loot we have cause its in a bank we cant get to on the other side of the world ....we get evaced into druid rings where many times things can be very dangerous even at high lvls  evac normally means someone is beat up if its you thats hurting haveing a guard/druid on you the moment you pop up doesnt help much... the price for our great soloing has been paid along the way . gosh i cant even sit around freeport<BR> bank and chum with my guildiees without getting killed by guards ...has any one stopped to think what a drag that can be  its not becuae ive killed NPCs and gotten kos...its all part of the "price" i paid for 50 lvls i accept that and deal with it im not asking for them to change the faction in FP for me =)  but i am asking to enjoy the 50+ game  AS a  necro   not some new class/battery type charcter..im just thinking maybe they should make it more clear when they think we have paid enough for our solo power?<P>i dont want to see anything taken from any class just to make me feel more usefull..but i would like to see our class adjusted like so many other classes have been .. im just saying are we over looked because they done such a good job on use before kunark and lvl 51-60 was addded<P>and i seem to feel the threads lean toward this being a problem only once in a great while when theres a god to be slain ro such ..lets face it many many of the 50+ zones in the game are "raid style" zones and are packed full of lots of big fat nasties much like the planes have.. i mean heck most of what anyone does after 50 falls into the big raid catagory..its all part of the 50+ game </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Cab<P>By your admission every enchanter has paid their dues completely by lvl 29.  A necro pays their dues from lvl 1-60 with the worst faction, horrible buy/sale rates, limited banking, and less-group friendly, etc. Enter sebilis and have an enchanter & necro shout lfg - I guarantee which one will be asked to grp first - the ENCHANTER!<P>This is a little off topic, but if you want to be fair Cab, I personally dont understand why the new enchanter spell Bood of Garu grants a lifetap proc?  Hmm why cant a necro buff a teammate with a lifetap proc this is a class defining spell?<P>Cab if you can NOT solo well, or use charm effectively well how is that a necro concern?  Yes, I have seen enchanters solo quite well indoors and outdoors.<P>In regards to Zerums post, I concur.  I do believe that Verant has gotten so use to considering the necro "close to being overpowered" for so long.  In fact, the game continues to evolve but Verant has given VERY little to the necro in order to keep pace.  Just look at our post 50 spells they are SOOO situational or have reagents so costly no one bothers to use many of them.  Same with our epic weapon, it is a great solo effect but at those levels we dont solo - thus the effect is the same as worthless.<P>I believe Verant needs to look at the necro classes from a new perspective and not from the "they are close to being overpowered" viewpoint of the past.  If druids and wizzards can quad kite, then fear kiting is no longer SOO powerful to hamper us into a mana battery role.<P>I chose the necromancer to be an offensive caster, a powerful adversary to be hated and feared.  I don't feel very powerful or feared just pumping my mana to the cleric and trying not to get hit.  Let me be the caster I was from 1-50 not the energizer bunny of mana!

</FONT><HR>I am soooo tired of the class envey of necros.  We are always told we are the most powerful, best solo, etc.  I say quit crying!  We do have the best DOTS, have a kickbutt pet, and have many spells of the other classes all rolled into one.  But, we also have the KOS in almost all areas, bad faction for buying/selling, and the fact that our powerful spells are very mana inefficent.  <P>Now, I would never trade my necro for any other class.  I love him and I won't give him up.  I have soloied most of my life and now post 50 have some megar group use.  I do get tired of being a battery, and I do get tierd of always being looked over for a mage or enchanter.  We should not be punished as much as we are, simply because we are the best at soloing.<P>I would like to see some moderaite changes.  How about allowing our 50-55 DOTS work 5% faster and 55-60 DOTS work 10% faster only in-doors or the planes.  This would increase our use on these raids, while not effecting game play.  We can't solo the high dungens and I know I can create havic in guk with just me and my pet now.  So, nothing changes but our ability to help in the large high level raids.  I would also like the conjure corpse be lowered to 50.  Since SK's now get the ability to summon corpses, we should be allowed to use the upgrade at 50 to balance it out.  I would rather have a SK that can summon over a necro that can any day.  The SK works better in the high raids, unlike us necros who are batteries.  I would also like the screaming terror to have an upgrade.  At 50 ST2 would last 30 seconds and have a memblur effect and could be cast on mobs 48 and lower.<P>For the people whom will look at these ideas and scream, please think about what I am asking.  I have not changed any balance issuses, just made we necros more usefull. It won't change our solo ability, and just allow us the fruits of our labor.<P>Vanell Dauthifox<BR>52 Heretic<BR>Order of Balance<BR>Prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=050264&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=050264&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
