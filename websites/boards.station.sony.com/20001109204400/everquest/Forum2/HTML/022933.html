</FONT><HR>since the quest started literally in one week the weapon dropped in value from 30k to around 15k. In the next too weeks it went from 15k to around 10k. Now (months i guess after quest) i saw one for 1000pp, i had money so i checked to see if this was a joke...unforunately it wasn't. I had recorded seeing 100+ straight rangers in EC ranging from level 17 to 43 having the damn thing. The quest is too easy and weilds a way too powerful weapon. Yes it eats stamina...blah blah blah, most people dont even check. I dont really care about overpaying because im keeping it but i think instead of nerfing its range slot change the quest or nerf it (the quest). This is only time i will ever ask for anything to be nerfed but this is ridiculous. I was thinking Cazic-Thule isn;t the biggest server, i cant imagine how many people have this on Karana. Please do something!!! change it, make it better, make it harder quest, or no more quest (enough already), i don't stand to see level 5 paladins, sk, war, rangers running around with this. Yes they have the right to twink but this weapon is around same price as ykesha and so much better at any level. My level 22 warrior does around 65-70s, thats almost same as ykesha proc!! PLEASE VERANT I BEG YOU DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE WURMSLAYER!!!  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ummm...I beg to differ.<P>As the regular partner and in-game Wife of a Paladin who wants this weapon more than anything I have to ask:<P>Why do you care that the price has come down? Because you can't make a king's ransom anymore? I can tell you that we don't have any $1,000 Wurmslayers on our server and if we do my partner might actually be able to be more effective now instead of a month from now when we actually save up the money to buy him one or gain enough levels to quest for one safely given our "off" hours (we play in the very early AM).  Given the ridiculous limitations on Paladins in terms of everything from "temporary" melee caps to hybrid experience penalties, getting a decent weapon like Wurmslayer is the least Verant can reward Paladins with.  <P>Jesus.  Some of you folks floor me with your selfishness.  Is the only thing you find rewarding being able to bleed people dry in the name of having something "special?"  Having more "stuff" than anyone else that is "special"? Obviously so, if you are willing to ask Verant to nerf the weapon yet again, based solely on an argument focusing on the decrease in player-market price since Verant nerfed it?<P>How unbelievably self-centered can you get?<P>Daia Spiritlight<BR>High Priestess of Quellious, 45th Devotion<BR>Rathe Server<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>you know whats funny? a good friend of mine plays on rathe. told me he traded full crafted (besides pauldron and BP) and EB BP for one. To me full crafted (w/ missing pieces) is less than 1k and EB BP is around 1k. That is 2k. A GODLY weapon which has stats better than that of razing sword of skarlon going for 2k? If you think i care about economics you think too hard. I want something to be done about everyone owning you. You might be one of the few w/out one. Point being how about no drop? Leave the ones people have and make them no drop.

</FONT><HR>"I am a little suspicious myself of whether there is a serious duping problem happening."<P>No, there isn't any duping.  This item is just incredibly easy and fast to get for a mid to high 40's group.<P>One sunday, my group got 7 people a wurmslayer in a space of 6 hours, if you don't count waiting for the guy in FV to spawn.<P>That night I traded it away (didn't get a whole lot of value for it, I had to trade too many items to quantify tho) so the very next day, I got another group together and we got 7 more in a period of 9 hours, 3 of which were spent looking for help in getting the tektite scale.<P>Now, realize something.  In both days, we actually got the dragon scales off the wurms that needed killing in about 3 or 4 hours, for 7 people each time.  The getting of the third scale (which 10,000 people could do at the same time if they wanted) and waiting for the Squire to spawn (which another 10,000 people could find at the same time too, if they wanted) was by far the most time consuming part of this quest.<P>So, it is only the spawn rates of the two named wurms determining how often these come into the game.  And as far as I can tell, the rate at which these can and do come into the game is about one every half hour, maybe even more.  That's about 50 a day.  In 40 days, you'll have 2000 on each server at that rate. <P>For a 25/40 one hand slashing weapon with an AC of 5 no less, I agree that this has the serious potential of replacing damn near every other weapon in the game.  If it weren't primary hand only, I don't think anyone else would use anything else right now.<P>Damn near every paladin and shadow knight, and quite a few rangers and warriors I've hunted with in Dreadlands in the last week has been using one (I'm really not just saying that) on Tunare Server.  Even as low as 35's - probably lower elsewhere, but I haven't left DL and BW much lately.  And it didn't seem that many people even knew how to get this weapon around 4 weeks ago.  <P>The only hard part of the quest (in terms of group power) is to kill Gullerback, a level 50ish gorilla that is the PH for Azaziel (sp?), one of the two necessary named wurms.  A friend of mine went for hers yesterday.  Her low to mid 40's group killed Gullerback once.  Then Azaziel spawned 4 times in a row over the next 40 minutes.  Yup, 4 people got the more difficult of the dragon scales, one every 10 minutes.<P>When I quested that, I saw the scale-dropping wurms spawn several times in a row as well, with a respawn of around 4 to 8 minutes usually.<P>I don't think I've ever asked for a nerf before (tho I've recognized some of them as reasonable and necessary after the fact) - but in this case, I'm seeing the inevitable coming - where every single melee will be using this weapon, cause the risk/reward for getting it is just totally out of whack compared to anything of equal power.  It may be a pretty cool looking weapon, but seeing EVERYONE with one is making for a pretty boring world.<P>By the way - don't nerf the weapon itself, just the spawn rates - they're unbelievably fast.  They may be the fastest respawn of any mob I know of in game (I really did see a repop within 4 minutes several times - I can't think of any other 4 minute spawn - everywhere else is at least 6 I think)<P>Qwinn Windfletcher<P>P.S.  I have one, but I'm generally not using it, cause I traded huge for a Swarmcaller, one of the very very few items I can wield in game that I think is superior to the Wurmslayer.  So this isn't a case of me already having mine and wanting no one else to get it - please - my server is flooded with 'em already, even if they nerfed the spawn tomorrow.  I'm not using it, I have better.  But I see it becoming the only primary hand weapon out there before long.<P>Oh, and I won't do it again myself, cause I'm concerned about the faction issues that I think will come up in Velious.  I'm guessing those that overdo this quest -will- get a surprise later on - and maybe that's what Verant has in mind as part of the risk of getting this weapon, we just don't know about it yet.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>i dont know, i think the rarity of the scales should be changed. Like a GBS, if you camp it non stop the chances of getting one (time wise) are 1:2-3 weeks. I think the scales should be the same. The swarmcaller is the best ranger weapon in the game if i recall correctly (or one of the best) and costs alot. Wurmslayer, another great weapon, is what 1/10 the price of the swarmcaller and pal,shd,rng,war can use it!! With proof of those spawn rates and excess of getting i really hope they do something</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Unfortunatley, a vast majority of the EQ population is ignorant, and thinks the Wurmslayer is a godly weapon. My advice?

</FONT><HR>Yes, it was...<P>Wurmslayer:<P>25 dmg, 40 delay, 5 ac, 5 str, 5 MR. 1h slashing<P>This is a VERY good weapon. One of the best actually. And it's not rare for a group of lvl 45-50 to get about 3-4 or more of these in ONE evening (without any cheats). The price is dropping very fast. 1000-2000 pp for one of the best weapon? Is it a joke ? NO. It is not a joke, it's a serious problem and should be FIX NOW!! <P>While the price of this Awesome weapon (well, no more because every other person is running with one) drop... the EQ econony is slowly dying. <P>What is the use of the hundred of weapons harder to get than wurmslayer but not nearly as good? They are useless, they are sold to merchants, they rot in bank, they are given to newbies. <P>EQ is my favorite game so far but I HATE seeing one of its best aspect (the econony) dying like that because of a dumb (but huge indeed) mistake that can be easily fixed.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>ROFL...Wurmslayer is not an Uber Weapon. I wish people would learn how the game mechanics work first. DMG/Ratio is only one part of the equation... there are also issues such as Prmary Hand Damage bonus, Procs, Weight, and stats. I have a wurmslayer, and it has sat in my bag for about 10 levels now. Its no where near as good as my Jade Maces, Crystaline Short Sword, Lamentation Blades... etc. There are many weapons at high levels that are much better (much better). In fact at higher levels the wurmslayer is considered trash (post 50 levels to be exact). Anyway... just my thoughts, I do have a 60 Level Iksar warrior... and if it weren't for the AC that the wurmslayer has, I would probably never find a reason to use it ever. (Though I still haven't used mine since level 50)<P>No need to nerf. Post 50 no one uses this unless they are unable to do a bit of camping/trading for the many better items.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

The average level 30 isn't going to be running around with a Wurmslayer."<P>Sorry, bud.  You're wrong on both counts.<P>On Tunare Server, the average level 30 IS running around with a Wurmslayer these days.  Tunare has -tons-, I mean seriously tons of over level 40 characters.  This weapon is probably coming into the game at around the rate of 35 or so a day.  Even if there weren't a single one on the server right now, if it started getting farmed at that rate today, you can expect WELL over 1,000 on the server by Christmas.  And I think there's already well over that on the server.<P>And the weapon is still -very- fine at level 49 for me.  I carry around the extra 15 weight just to have it as a backup.  Damage 25 Delay 40... yes, we all know that lower delay weapons get the damage bonus more frequently, yes, we know that ratio is not everything, but some of you are taking the opposite extreme and saying that the speed of the weapon is everything.  25 40 is an absolutely amazing ratio for a 1hs weapon.  Yeah, sure, a Lamentation blade is better, and a few others you mentioned - and as far as I know, none of them can be gotten with less than level 50 characters.  One of the times I quested the wurmslayer, two people in the group were under 42.<P>This weapon FAR outdamages a Yak.  At level 49 I can count on getting two double attacks of around 100 at least a couple of times - the Yak just isn't going to make up for that unless I have ungodly dex and it procs constantly.  And the Yak doesn't give me any stats or AC.  Wurmslayer doesn't taunt enough?  Have none of you read the ranger threads?   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  This is a -great- weapon for a ranger, believe me, even with this and a shield I can still taunt anything I need to, and the ac is just icing on that.  Pallies can taunt with stuns, rangers and sk's with snare.  And as for pallies and shadow knights, it's awesome cause they can still do very solid damage while carrying a shield, allowing them to bash.<P>What pallie in his right mind would go for a ghoulbane with this weapon SO cheap and easy to get around, except for RP reasons?<P>I have yet to see lowered stamina have any impact in my fighting ability.  And rangers can invigor.  I think Pallies can too?<P>To those of you screaming "ALL NERFS ARE BAD", well, basically every lesser weapon in game (i.e. any weapon that can be gotten at less than 50) is pretty much obsolete.  Or, since it's such a buzzword for you, they've all been indirectly nerfed.<P>Look at what happened to the BIBS after Axe of the Ironback came into the game in droves.  They're a newbie give away item now (I know, I gave one away last night  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  I bought mine way back when for 400 plat.<P>This weapon is FAR FAR better than the Axe, and has the potential to obsolete far more items.<P>Qwinn Windfletcher<BR>49th Ranger<BR>Tunare Server<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Folks, this is normal.  Cope.<P>Same thing happened with the stein of maggok.  When the quest was first put in I could get 1500 plat for one.  Within two weeks 800 plat was a lucky sale.<P>Now...if you get 100 for one its a gift.  If you have issues, take them up with all the spoiler sites that make this stuff easy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Sorry, but the folks who are the most strident in calling for the nerf of this weapon made their real concerns plain very early on in the thread with what they chose, unchallenge, to use as the basis for their arguments.  <P>This is about them having (a) rare phat l3wt or (b) the ability to suck others dry for plat because they have something that everyone else wants.<P>All this new found concern for the devaluation of other weapons used by lower level players is notable, since it arose after folks like myself rightly pointed out that folks seemed more concerned about the "market" than they did about the players who can genuinely use and benefit from this weapon at the levels it's intended for.  Since not all players are stat junkies, and want only to do reasonable damage for their level (my partner at 45 is still using his Ghoulbane, with increasing ineffectiveness), all the arguments about why the weapon "sucks" are not dispositive for many many players about whether this weapon still means something to them.<P>Just for the record, after reading the insistance that you can buy a Wurmslayer on my server for 1K, I have spent the last 2 days trying to do just that.  The lowest price on the server anyone was willing to accept -- after bargaining, was 5K plat.  6K was the default minimum, several were higher.<P>Anyone who claims the average price for Wurmslayers on Rathe is 1-2K because the market is flooded please track me down (I'll be on a good part of the weekend) and sell me and everyone else I tell about it (and I have a wide circle of friends, all of who also have friends =)) one, at that price.  Infinitely until the market's dried up, because I know a lot of folks in their 40's who do not have this weapon who would like it. Then maybe I'll be convinced its market flooding (as opposed to a pocketbook drought) that is motivating people.  <P>This is ridiculous.  My level 45 Paladin partner cannot quest for Wurmslayer yet because we don't have a group able to take out the higher end mobs given the hours that we usually play, but folks on this Board who already have theirs (and probably have sold a few too) are screaming about how awful it is that someone else might have the same success getting the weapon that they did.<P>Human nature continues to astound me.<P>Peace and Love,<BR>Daia Spiritlight<BR>High Priestess of Quellious, 45th Devotion<BR>Rathe Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
