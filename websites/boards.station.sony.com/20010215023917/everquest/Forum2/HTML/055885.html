&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>It's very hard to find anything wrong with the overall balance of this class.  They can solo for their entire career fairly well.  Because of their pets, they are welcome enough in any group, and at higher levels they get the Malo spell line that makes them even more welcome.  There is some concern about the use of pets in higher level groups.  Pathing in places can make them more of a danger than a help.  And any creature with an AoE fear spell will exclude the use of magician pets.  I'm not sure that these issues constitute any sort of imbalance, though.  Fixing them, however, would most certainly eliminate any concern that magicians might have about having something to do in raids against the boss mob, or against the high hit point Velious monsters.  Having powerful pets gives them the ability to contribute to the combat, regardless of the magic resistance of the monster, or the magicians available mana.<P>So, most of what is listed below are essentially minor.  The issue of a change to the way rain spells work crosses several classes, though, and is the only real sweeping concern here.  The change to the way link death and logging back in works hit magicians pretty hard.  The tedium and expense of summoning new items when you go link dead is harsh.<P>No Rent Items:  We all know what happened when we changed the way players log back into the servers after disconnect, and how that affected magicians (not to mention people holding no rent quest items).  The most viable solution for this seems to be making No Rent items disappear on log in instead of log out, and only if the last log in time was more than 30 minutes prior.  This would be a perfect solution (and one that I’ve heard the players suggest a few times).<BR>		<BR>Rain Spells:  Can we remove the pets from the equation?  Just this would probably make them useful without making them too useful.  I've looked at the numbers, and adding more waves would probably overpower these spells by a large margin.  We might want to look at the resistance on these spells, though.  They may be too high.<BR>		<BR>New Summoned Proc’ing Weapons:  With the recent changes to the status of pets (making them Pets instead of NPCs) and the fix to the way their weapons proc (and the ‘nerf’ of the Sword of Runes) we also mentioned that we would be adding new proc’ing summoned weapons for them.  Perhaps something like this could be a good way to introduce a few situational weapons.<P>Pathing:  Any continuing improvement on pathing would be a great benefit to magicians.  There are several places where the pathing, rather than the actual pet or the zone design intent, is bad enough to exclude the use of a pet.<BR>Notes:  Get specific zone examples where pathing is at its worst.	<P>Pets and AoE fear:  Pets are unwanted against any enemy that can cast an area of effect fear spell (and those are some of the more important encounters, at least emotionally), because the pet will always flee, and will often run directly into other monsters that the party does not want to engage.  It might be nice to give magicians the ability to make their pets immune to fear for short periods of time.  It could be debated about letting them make other pets immune to fear.  And it will most certainly be expected by the players that immunity to fear would make more sense for necromancer pets than mage pets.  But, as always, gameplay has to come before appearances.<P>Voceration: Fire and Greater Voceration: Fire:  The claim is that these two pets do less damage than the level 29 fire pet.  Are they really less useful than the 29th level pet? Can someone check?  If it is, should it be?  Perhaps another careful examination of these pets is in order…<P>Spell Drops:  Could someone look into the 54th level Water Pet Spell (heck, all the 54th level pets) and Blizzard, just to see if they are dropping off the right level monsters?  There is a rumor that the water pet is dropping off of lower level mobs in Skyfire.  Is that really where it should drop?<P>Pet Names:  How about letting players pick a pet name (just one per character) and have all of their pets named by that name.  It would be no more likely to be abused than the naming of characters, and it would make people with pets much happier.  Not to mention it would help diversify the landscape a bit.  Or perhaps some other way to allow for more interesting names than the list they are randomly chosen from now.<BR>		<BR>Pet Graphics:  How about a new graphic for high level magician and enchanter pets, something to match the spectre for the necros.  At least can we look into getting an interesting look for the epic pet, something like the original appearance (this thing looked pretty cool the first time out, then something bad happened and it lost its cool looks)?<P>Rage of Zomm:  How about making it look like a big fat Eye of Zomm?<P>DoTs:  Why did we give magicians DoT's with Velious?  It does seem a bit odd.<P>Dyzil's Deafening Decoy:  The claim is that it doesn't actually seem to decoy very well.  We should up its ability to taunt.  I don’t see a reason that it can’t be a super taunter.  With its low hit points, letting it taunt the heck out of things wouldn’t seem to overpower it.  Though, if it’s going to be attacked so much maybe we should give it a few more hit points.  Also (or maybe instead), perhaps making it more of an escape spell would be a good idea.  Give it a very short casting time (2 seconds), so that magicians could summon it in bad situations real quick and then run like heck.  (Summary of requests for this spell:  A lot more taunt, more hit points, 2 second cast time).<BR> <BR>Higher level pet healing spell:  By giving them a better healing pet healing spell (a standard upgrade) at higher levels, we can force them to decide if they want to heal or summon a new one in a tight spot.  The last one they get is at 20th level, I think.  It’s a good spell line that seems worthy of continuation.<P>Improved Invisibility:  Why don’t magicians get this spell?<P>Phantom Armor:  Two concerns here.  The first is that it uses 4 components!  That’s an awful lot of components to carry around.  It would be nice to make the component a single item that costs 4 (or even more) times as much.  The second concern is that it is overwritten by Shield of Words. It seems to me that the 52nd level personal magician spell should hold over the 49th level cleric spell.  Though the cleric spell seems to have more AC, the mage spell also give additional regen…<P>Aegis of Ro:  The players think that this spell is more than rare, that it is not dropping at all.  I've also been told by a very few players (one that I can think of) that it does indeed drop off a dragon in Dreadlands.  Perhaps a slight increase in the drop rate on this spell would be good.  (Note:  Obviously we've fixed this one since I wrote this.  This spell never was dropping, but is now.}<BR>		<BR>Pet Fear Immunity spell:  One idea that came in during the necromancer thread spurred me to suggest this.  Area of affect fear spells make pets unwanted in some places.  How about we give magicians a spell that would allow them to make a pet immune to fear for a short while?  (another note:  See, the dev team DOES read these threads…)<BR>		<BR>Robe of Conjuration:  Both necromancer and magician pantaloons (legs) for caster classes give them mana free level 50 pet buffs (Burnout III, Augment Death), but the necromancer robe has the level 57 Conjure corpse, while the Robe of Conjuration gives the level 49 damage shield.  How about changing the magician leggings to the level 56 damage shield?<BR>		<BR>Pet Health Bars:  It would be nice if the magician could see his pet's health bar at all times.  Even better if every party member could see the health bars of all party pets.<P>Ok, keep in mind that this list was written a while ago.  Obviously some of these items have already been added.  And some of them really are not class balance issues (I wrote this up before the idea of starting the class balance threads even existed).  So, please, let's only talk about these ideas (if you don't like them or think I've written them incorrectly) and new ones.  But please keep in mind, if you know you've stated it before and it is not on this list, that's probably because I purposefully did not add it to the list…<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>===Different models for 50+ pets===<BR>Notice I said Different, not New. This would requre no extra space from the global file, because the models are already in there! After level 50, the Magician elemental pets start to take on unique abilities. Why not give them models that reflect thoes abilities?<P>Fire - Wizard; Erudite or Dark Elf model<BR>Air - Monk; Human or Iksar model<BR>Water - Rogue; Halfling or Gnome model<BR>Earth - Warrior; Troll or Ogre model<P>Make it random which of the 2 models is chosen, and random wether you get a male or female model for your pet too for extra fun. If the 'elemental' skins could be applied to these models it would be nice, but personally I'd be happy enough with just the different models for the pets.<P>===Magician Epic Quest===<BR>I believe you've heard a lot of complaints about this already Absor, so I'll just ask you to please have someone look into how insanely difficult the Magician epic is in comparison to other epic quests and leave it at that. See how many level 50+ Rogues have their epic compared to level 50+ Magicians for example. Allowing Call of the Hero to work in the Plane of Sky might help.<P>===Phantom armor spells===<BR>The Magician Phantom Leather / Phantom Chain / Phantom Plate / Phantom Armor line of armor spells are over written by the cleric Holy Armor / Spirit Armor / Guard / Armor of Faith / Shield of Words / Bulwark of Faith line of armor spells.<P>I do not care that they don't stack, that is fine. The problems I have with the situation is:<P>The cleric spells can *NOT* be clicked off. If I want the regen my spell has and would rather deal with the lower AC my Phantom mage armor spell has to get it, and a passing cleric casts his cleric armor spell on me, then not only did his intended act of kindness just cost me 1 to 4 cat's eye agate, but I now have to stop whatever I was doing, memorize dispell magic, dispell myself untill I get rid of his cleric armor spell, then recast my armor spell and whatever other buffs were dispelled in the proccess before I can get back to whatever I was hunting. His spell overwriting mine I can grudgingly deal with even if it annoys me and costs me money, but for Innoruuk's sake at least let me click off the cleric spell if I don't want it!<P>===Illusion Earth / Air / Fire / Water elemental=== <BR>I know, I know, enchanters across the world will want my head on a stick now for even thinking of this. I don't really have much to say on this subject other than I think it would be fitting for Magicians to have these spells too. Druids get to look like wolves, Shamen get to look like Bears, Necromancers get to look like skeletons, Magicians should get to look like Elementals. Just seems natural to me.<P>===Improved Invisibility===<BR>Druids get Improved Superior Camouflage. Clerics and Necromancers get Improved Invisibility to Undead. Enchanters and Wizards get Improved Invisibility. Why were Magicians left out of the upgrades to Invisibility? <P>===Rain Spells===<BR>As I write this, currently on the Test Server you are working to make pets no longer 'soak' a hit from the rain spells. Great! Wonderful! However there is another issue regarding rain spells I would like to call to your attention. As they work now, rain spells will hit up to 4 times, maximum total. Is this how Verant intends them to function? May of us were under the impression that each WAVE of the rain is supposed to be able to strike up to 4 targets. Given that with the current mana/damage ratio of these spells I need at LEAST 3 hits from the rain spell to make it be as effective as simply casting a Direct Damage spell, I have never been able to justfy casting a rain spell in combat. Please either look into the mana/damage ratios of these spells or ajust how they function, else rain spells will remain unused by most magicians.<P>===Anti Summoned Creature spells===<BR>I know a lot of people will flame me saying this is a useless idea, but I'd like to see magicians get spell lines Charm Summoned Creature, Fear Summoned Creature, and Lull Summoned Creature as a matter of principal if nothing else. Necromancers can do these things to undead creatures, why shouldn't Magicians be able to do the same to Summoned creatures? Just clone the current Necro spells, give them new names, and retag them to only work on summoned beasties. I'll even make it easy and make a list for ya here of the renamed Necromancer spells that could be used as templates. I have simply replaced "undead" with "summoned". Spell descriptions taken from http://eq.castersrealm.com (Oh, and voice graft added bacuse magicians have been wanting this one for a long time! If you want us to roleplay, giving us the tools to do so helps a lot. Don't be so restrictive with spells and abilites that don't even effect the outcome of a hack and slash fight. Heck, give Voice Graft to the Enchanter, Shaman, and Druid classes while you're at it!)<P><BR>-Level 4-<BR>Name:  Numb Summoned <BR>Mana:  20 <BR>Class:  Abjuration<BR>Type:  Single Target Crowd Control <BR>Max Duration:  2 minutes <BR>Casting Time:  2 seconds <BR>Recast Time:  3 seconds <BR>Actual Effects: Summoned Target: Lowers Frenzy Radius (25 Feet) ; Summoned Target: Lowers reaction Radius (15 Feet) <BR>Description: This spell will reduce the aggro range for a summoned mob. <P><BR>-Level 12-<BR>Name:  Spook Summoned <BR>Mana:  10 <BR>Class:  Alteration<BR>Max Duration:  18 seconds <BR>Casting Time:  2 seconds <BR>Recast Time:  4 seconds <BR>Actual Effects: Summoned Target: Fear <P><BR>-Level 16-<BR>Name:  Voice Graft <BR>Mana:  10 <BR>Class:  Divination <BR>Max Duration:  27 minutes <BR>Casting Time:  6 seconds <BR>Recast Time:  12 seconds <BR>Actual Effects: Self: Talk through pet <P><BR>-Level 20-<BR>Name:  Dominate Summoned <BR>Mana:  100 <BR>Class:  Alteration <BR>Max Duration:  8 Minutes <BR>Casting Time:  5 seconds <BR>Recast Time:  10 seconds <BR>Actual Effects: Target: Make a Summoned Mob Your Pet <P><BR>-level 24-<BR>Name:  Rest Summoned <BR>Mana:  75 <BR>Class:  Abjuration <BR>Type:  Single Target Crowd Control <BR>Max Duration:  2 minutes <BR>Casting Time:  3.1 seconds <BR>Recast Time:  Instant <BR>Actual Effects: Undead: Lower Reaction Radius (1 Foot) ; Undead: Lower frenzy Radius (1 Foot) <BR>Description: This is an upgrade to Numb Summoned. <P><BR>-Level 29-<BR>Name:  Panic Summoned <BR>Mana:  50 <BR>Class:  Alteration <BR>Type:  General Purpose <BR>Max Duration:  54 seconds <BR>Casting Time:  2 seconds <BR>Recast Time:  4 seconds <BR>Actual Effects: Summoned Target: Fear <BR>Description: This is the second spell that will cause summoned creatures to stop attacking and run away.

A successful charm will always last exactly this long before the spell wears off. <P>===Too many Evocation spells===<BR>Often, it seems like Magician spells were tagged as Evocation without any thought being put into it.<BR>The spells Shock of Blades, Shock of Spikes, Shock of Swords are all conjuration, which is fine and dandy. However the spells Rain of Blades, Rain of Spikes, and Rain of Swords are all Evocation, which just seems wrong.<P>The spells Ward Summoned, Dismiss Summoned, Expell Summoned, Banish Summoned, Exile Summoned, and Banishment are all direct damage spells that work only against Summoned creatures. One would presume that they would use the same magical mechanics as summoning a creature or item, only in reverse, and so be Conjuration based. Unfortunately they are all Evocation based.<P>And finally two of the new spells from Velious, Elemental Maelstrom and Wrath of the Elements, are also Evocation based. I thought when Magicians brought elemental things into this world they used Conjuration to do it?<P>You took note of the enchanters when they told you that no one who makes a new enchanter choses a religion other than agnostic because all their friends who have been in the game for awhile let them know how many more extra problems religion gives non-agnostic encanters. We are telling you that nearly all magicians end up specialising in evocation because conjuration is made to be such a poor second in battle. If you want there to be more diversity among magicians, this is an easy way to do it! And please PLEASE do not forget that there is a quest in the Temple of Solusek Ro that allows one to change their specialisation, so yes existing characters could take advantage of this change too!<P>In the past the argument has been made by Verant's representatives that too many players who have magicians specialised in Evocation would be inconvenienced if *any* of the above spells were changed to Conjuration from Evocation. I would like to point out that not only would *many* evocation based attack spells remain, but more often than not they are the *best* ones that magicians have! These are the Evocation based attack spells that would remain if the other spells I discussed were changed to Conjuration. Yes, a few spell levels would be skipped if this change were made, but currently *many* more spell levels are skipped if you go with conjuration under the current system, hence the heavy bias twoards evocation many magicians have.<P>-Level 1-<BR>Burst Of Flame<P>-Level 4-<BR>Burn Fire<BR>Fire Flux <P>-Level 8-<BR>Flame Bolt<P>-Level 12-<BR>Column Of Fire<P>-Level 16-<BR>Shock Of Flame<P>-Level 20-<BR>Bolt Of Flame<BR>Rain Of Fire<P>-Level 24- <BR>Flame Flux<P>-Level 34-<BR>Blaze<BR>Cinder Bolt<P>-Level 39-<BR>Flame Arc<BR>Rain Of Lava<P>-Level 49-<BR>Lava Bolt<P>-Level 51-<BR>Scintilation<P>-Level 52-<BR>Char<P>-Level 54-<BR>Scars of Sigil<P>-Level 55-<BR>Sirocco<P>-Level 59-<BR>Manastorm<BR>Seeking Flame of Seukor</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree that Magicians are overall quite potent and have no real balance problems but that doesn't mean there are no issues that need to be looked at.  The Anti-Fear spell, for example, is a good choice for a Magician because that allows them to contribute in fights where pets get feared away.  It seems to be a bit high level, but that's just me.<P>Summons are poorly distributed, even in a brand new server with no equipment the way items are allowed for Magicians to summon are very poor.  For example, at level 12, the spell is 'summon fang' which is simply a magic dagger like the 1st level summon but 2 damage more and 5 delay slower.<P>By level 12, it is not unreasonable to face creatures that require magic items to kill on occasion, and this item is simply pathetic in any setting.  Now put it in an older server, and the item is just trash, no magician ever summons one.<P>That is the kind of issues faced by Magicians, they should be summoning arrows and shuriken by level 12, and summoning weapons people might want to use on occasion on even an older server by level 20.<P>Magicians also suffer more than any other class from the broken nature of AE Rain spells (hint: pets being a valid target is NOT the real problem).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi:<P>Looking at the list the biggest thing I would like to see is an anti-fear spell for the pet. This could really help us in those massive encounters where fear is a problem.<P>Magicians are all about pets and when the pet is useless the magician is very handicaped. I should note that fear is a problem for all pet classes and not just magicians. Perhaps the correct solution instead of imunity is a summoned pet only item that very greatly raises a pets resistance to fear and that can be give to any non-charmed pet.<P>I do tend to agree that magicians are a great class with a few problems and very few of them are balance issues as you point out.<P>Spell's do seem to be dropping at low rates and some are very rare. Improved drops would be appreciated.<P>The biggest problem at link death is that the pet dies. This is the mages defence but I really have to say I've not had that much to complain about with LD.<P>The 52 and 58 fire pets are really that bad. I dont know if 29 is the proper comparison but they are poor! I've used one exactly once in the several months I've been able to cast the spell.<P>Perhaps on summoned items you could make different ones with different affects for different pets? (ie. One item only a fire pet could use, one only a water, etc) This could help restore some of the differences in the pets that was lost when they all got the same delay with the DW fix.<P>As to fixing rain spells to not count pets that would be a plus to several clases as you mention and might make them of more value depending on resists. (I dont know what kind of resist rates they have since I never use them now.)<P>The change list I saw for test looked good but I would prefer the anti-fear spell be a bit lower in level than 59.<P>Thanks.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Woot! =)<P>Fun spells, Absor =)  I will betcha pretty much anything on my mage that if you include a few fun summons (like 10) then most of the complaining will stop =)  Voice Graft, Elemental Illusion, summon fireworks, summon (new graphic weapons).  Summon Monster is awesome!!  I have been playing nearly nonstop since that spell was released in attempts to get to 34 =)<P>Offensively, we are wonderful, though i seem to get resisted a bunch.  <P>I see that we are completely missing DDs and Bolts at level 29, which hampers our offensiveness...  <P>If the pets are really taken out of the rain equation, then it would be a bit more useful.  If the resists were lowered on top of that, then i think that i would actually use a mem slot for the spell.<P>Pet names would be cool, but i would also hope that changes could be treated like surnames.<P>Pet health bars WOULD ROCK!! =)<P>Ermm.. thats it for now  =)  Thanks!!<P>--Secias</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I can truthfully say that we as mages don't need "tweeking", but there are those issues that we would like to see addressed.  Most of those have been stated in the Summoned Things thread and have been covered by you in your post.  The only 2 items that I would like to comment on are the post 50 fire pets and the summoned weapons.  <P>52 lvl Fire is a waste of mana in most situations.  It will indescrimently dispell and that can really annoy and sometimes kill party members.  Can't comment on the 58th as I don't have it, but word from friends is it's just as bad.<P>Summoned weapons have been a laughing matter since lvl 20.  We have daggers that will give some MR and swords that will proc against Summoned.  Why not add something to the items that we currently have instead of making new ones(although a 1hb item would rock).  Modify the daggers to proc for rogues.  Would be awesome for 54 lvl pets(if I ever see the spell drop, sorry didn't mean to go there).  Get rid of that silly see invis on the staff of symbols...Maybe a +2 int bonus and small proc like shock of spikes.  Make these weapons real nice weapons because they will go poof.  Give us post 50 mages something that says "I am a Mage, don't get in my way", not that it would need to talk.  But maybe that 1hb staff that looks really cool...I know, I am reaching here.  <P>Anyway, thanks for taking the time to listen.  Some of the things that are out there on the test server are very nice and I can't wait to see them if they make it that far.<P>Graytalon,<BR>Lowly Mage, CT</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'll keep this positive.<P>We have a hard time in some groups because pets cannot be pulled off of an attacking mob.  If I hit the /pet back off hotkey as fast as I can, I can SOMETIMES get it to back off in time for a mes.  How about a /pet no attack command so he stands there and takes a beating without hitting back?<P>Our summons are terrible.  I won't exagerrate and say worthless, but they're terrible.  That's being handled by another thread.  Good enough.<P>I'd like some more availability of gloves at the lower to mid levels.  I know it sounds piddling, but I'm having some serious difficulty finding some of any real value.<P>A second bind point with a second gate spell to it would be wonderful.  <P>A pet regen spell would be nice.  You mentioned the upgrade to the healing, but a regen line would be nice as well.  Heck, I'd even be willing to sacrifice say...sword of runes, the two staff summon spells, and the spear summon spell for a pet regen spell.  :P<P>How about a regular shield spell for our pets?  If we're so pet-centric, let us buff the pet beyond the burnout line.<P>Perhaps make it so we can summon a pet for twice or three times the mana with no reagent?  I think we're rather doubly hit on corpse runs because we have no escape spells and don't have our pets either.  Maybe make a soulbound reagent bag that can be crafted if a good tailor works with (or is) a high level enchanter?<P>The DoT?  Not our style.  Change it.  You seem to be very thoughtful and listen to us, so I'm sure you can come up with something.  I've not used it, but I assume it's a decent spell, but we're not dotters, and we never have been.<P>Give us some control over the type of monster we summon with the Summon Monster series.  It's a great spell, but our focii are useless if we cannot predict what type of mob we're summoning.<P>Chain research is malignant.  Right now, I have to research the 39 spell to get it as a component for the research of the 44 spell, to then research the 49 spell.  If I fail on the 49, I've lost considerable work.  I don't mind research, but chain research is an evil that no other class has.  Could that be removed or resolved?<P>Just some ideas.<P>Thanks!<P>Sub<P>P.S. While I'm not a VAK, I've got to say that I rather appreciate the position you take with us.  I no longer feel like an opponent...even when you disagree with me.  I may not like all of your decisions, but at least you listen and examine our side of the issue.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>On the topic of pets and fearing, can someone clarify for me:<P>When fighting a mob with AoE fear, a player is feared and runs off into another group critters. The player will just die and the extra mobs stay where they are.<P>A pet however, gets feared and encounters more critters, who kill the pet pet BUT are now angry at the pets owner and all rush to crash the rading party.<P>As I understand it, this is the fundamental difference between players and pets getting feared. My suggestion is to make NPC AoE spells not effect pets. If Vox managed to fear everyone but a few pets continue to whack on her, I don't think she'd have much difficulty munching them into bits pretty fast.

</FONT><HR>Paragraph 1 - mages cannot solo their entire career.  Mages can solo a single (read 1) mob post 50 with a good pet and a full bar of mana to dump.  While a mage can solo, they can't do it effectively enough to make it worthwhile.  Don't think that a pet and malo makes a mage welcome in any group.  Malo gets resisted a fair bit, and while a pet is nice in a less than full group, oftentimes a full group doesn't include a mage because the 6th man can do more damage than the pet and/or the mage combined (especially over time).  Mage resistance rates make them wholly less desirable than almost any other class against AoE fearing mobs.  Not really a point in mages even going on these events.<P>Rain spell resistance rates are too high.  I will do more damage with DD to multiple mobs than using rains.  Rains get resisted way too much to make them worth casting.<P>LD is a huge mage issue.. any way of retaining summoned items after LD would be a huge benefit.<P>according to what I've read, pets have been removed from the rain equation, and that should be going live soon? yes?<P>New proc summon weapons is something every mage wants.<P>Pathing: pick a dungeon.  any dungeon.  to give examples - gorge of king xorbb, the throne room.  I stand against a wall and summon a pet.  the pet then immediately runs all the way up to the throne, turns around, and runs all the way back, just to stand next to me.  floor 6, tower of frozen shadows. zone in platform - summon a pet, an it immediately takes off and takes the first left, into a hallway full of mobs.  Upper Guk, heading to the nearest above water enterance to lower guk, you cross the plank where the underwater place to the skeletal monk guy is, and you can go left or right, either way taking you to another intersection.  Mage goes right, pet goes left. Bad.<P>Fighting any mob that fears makes pets undesirable- they always (Murphys Law) go find at least half a dozen of the nastiest "yard trash" it can find and brings them back, or gets itself killed far away from the mage, yet every mob knows exactly who's pet it was, where they are, the fastest way to get there, and which way to go to bring the most possible friends....personally, I would rather have the pet return to its home plane (be desummoned) on being feared, or have an "immune to fear" buff that is pet only starting at 44-49.<P>The 50+ fire pets are supposed to be wizards, so they have no hp, use o'keils radiation, and cast dispell, then melee.  this is totally messed up.<P>Pet spell drops are all rare, don't drop in the right places, and are sold by other players for insane amounts of money, which is totally unfair to mages.  And yes, the 54 water pet does drop in skyfire, I got one off a skycinder drake 2 weeks ago.<P>Either a name for all pets, or the player's name followed by pet, like NPC's.  That would make pets and owners very easy to identify.<P>Either have them look meaner, like a totally black earth pet, with red veins popping out (etc) - really mean and sinister looking, and or make them BIG.  I mean the 51 earth is only a teeny bit bigger than the 49 earth.  Of course, that opens the issue of pets fitting  through doorways...but really, really evil looking pets post 50 would be great.<P>Rage of Zomm is eye on steroids, going through 'roid rage - beef it up  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>The dots are actually LESS effective than our DD's, mana cost considered also.  They are pointless.<P>The decoy, doesn't.<P>Yes please, a decent pet heal.. when your pet has 3k hp, a 220 hp heal is like a waste of mana.<P>Improved Invis - good question.<P>the 4 component thing for the armor series bites.  it should change at phantom plate, not phantom armor.  phantom plate takes 3...and thats 1 too many.<P>I have seen this spell 1 time.  On a vendor.  I saw someone offering 30k pp for it.  When I went back to the vendor, it was gone.....someone was still offering 30k pp for it.  Similar prices exist for pets and other mage spells.  Um, sorry, I don't carry around 100k pp to buy these rare, misplaced and otherwise nearly impossible to get spells.  Sorry for the sarcasm, but I hate drop spells, I think its a stupid idea.  What the heck good is research post 50?  Seems like a viable alternative to being forced to camp certain creatures/zones for spells...<P>the PoG thing needs to be looked at<P>Pet health bars - green line through the mages hp like the blue line on xp for pet health would be sweet.<P>Now:  I'm going to post again other concerns that aren't here.  Where you got the idea that the magician was "balanced ok" post 50 is beyond me.  Pre 50, with the exeption of LD and the lack of summoning upgrades, there isn't really a lot to say.  Post 50 there are some real problems.<P>Oh, and in your line about the 54 water pet and other pets, you said there was a spell called Blizzard???? Um, never seen it, never heard of it, never seen it auctioned, its not on any of the "castersrealm" type websites, never seen it cast, don't know what the heck you are talking about.<P>I'll be back in a few minutes with the list I put together...I had it ready and waiting for you  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Akherat<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>No Rent Items: I agree with your accessment<P>Rain Spells: Removing the pet from the equasion seems to have been done on test.  *IF* that goes live these spells will have some usefulness attatched to them again for Magicians.<P>New Summoned Proc’ing Weapons: Yes SoR was a bug, but after more than a year it had become a very engrained way of things.  It would be very nice to have new summoned procing weapons.  Really other than the hole where are SoR useful anymore? I dont even summon them anymore because the pet auto-dual wields.<P>Pathing: Plane of Hate, assume you are on the west wall slightly north of the SW corner.  If your not careful and a MOB is pulled at starts fighting up near the corner of the building north of your position and then sudenly aggros on a caster in the back then the pet goes all the way north the the NW corner and back. (or ties as a good magician either catches this initially and revents it or kills pet).  <P>The Hole, just plain bad.  <P>Sebilis crypt area in the tunnels.  If I do not walk my pet allong spamming /pet follow me button then he gets stuck if I get more than 20 feet ahead.  I have to wait at every corner and turn him carefully.  I usually just kill it and summon a new one at the Emporor room.<P>Pets and AoE fear: The spell suggested will be a nice bonus to Mages.  It would be nice to make it castable on pets other than our own but that may be asking to much.<P>Voceration: Fire and Greater Voceration: Fire: Hehe ok here is a good one.  The problem here is the pet casts very low (20ish) Wizard spells **and** attempts to melee.  This pet has has the innate FireElementalAura spell removed for a 2 point Damage Shield (O'Kells Radiation).  Traditionally Fire pets have the Lowest HP of all pets but the High Damage Shield heped it make up for this.  Now when it tries to melee it does very very low damage that is not even worth considering.  At level 52 when you get the first Fire Pet Wizard it cannot solo a Forest Giant Arbor about 90% of the time. My level 44 Fire Pet has a better success rate than that.  Now it has been mentioned that this pet is situational.  Well the situation it is best suited for is when a Casting Mob is being atttacked and the spells disrupt casting to an extent.  However due to it trying to melee  It is better to use the level 53 air pet (or 49 one if your not 53 yet) as the Air pet will do more damage and stun/interupt about the same amount of time.  An easy fix is to have this Fire Pet chain cast and not melee period.  Only move to remain in casting range or, and most definitly preferred, simply return the Fire Pet to a warrior status and give it the old FireElementalAura back.<P>Spell Drops: Level 54 Water most commonly drops off Sebilis Juggs/Reets.  Yes sometimes in Skyfire but rare (way to rare).<P>Pet Names: Doesnt really matter to me...much more pressing ssues need to be addressed first.<P>Pet Graphics: Monster Summoning is cool but limited in its usefulness. Other than parking a Cyclops near theDruid port in WC the first few days I havent used it.  It is definitly a cool idea though =)<P>Rage of Zomm: Never ever use these.  Similar to the Decoy pet.  If I need an immediate exit then I certainly dont have time to summon up either of these things.  I most certainly will not be using them in place of a normal pet.<P>DoTs: Yes it does seem odd.  Especially since the mana/dmg ratio is exactly the same as our nukes.  Isnt the idea of a DoT supposed to be better mana to dmg ratio over time?  Please either relook the mana/dmg ratio or possibly give us a new nuke in its place that is coujuration based.<P>Dyzil's Deafening Decoy: Yes please make it taunt more and reduce casting time.  this thing cannot do enough dmg (unless it initialtes the fight) to pull something off of me.  This makes it high damage shield worthless because its not getting hit.<P>Higher level pet healing spell: Thanks for seeing it from our perspective =) after level 34 the level 20 heal is basically never even memed.  I havet used it since then and at 56 I would burn a whole mana bar trying to heal a 51 Earth summoned up with my staff.<P>Improved Invisibility: It is truly puzzleing why we are the only pure caster not given and upgrade to our invis spell (be is invis or invis undead).<P>Phantom Armor: I agree with points you have mentioned.  Ours should not be overwritted by clerics (and please make it take like a 1pp stone I have to carry around 10 stacks of cats eye aggates 10 stacks of malachite, 40 periodots, 20 jasper, 100 pearls arg...what a waste of inv space)<P>Aegis of Ro: Told ya so 8) (sorry couldnt resist)<P>Pet Fear Immunity spell: Wow you do?  (j/k)<P>Robe of Conjuration: The 56 DS would seem more appropriate give the time/circumstances you get this.  If you deam the 56 DS to powerful, how about making the spell the level 52 Group DS (which is group level 49 DS).<P>Pet Health Bars: Agree.<P>One additional request to discuss.  Pet Command radius along the Y-axis.  I have been in numerous situations where perhaps my pet is 2 feet above me (Y) and 5 feet away (X) and i cant get it to follow me, attack (unless im getting hit), get lost, or guard.  This happens a lot with elevation problems is there any way to look into this please?<P>Thanks for looking at this issue Alan, I hope you read some of my previous posts even if you didnt comment on them.<P>Thanks,<P>Jaytee Bushwacker &lt;Obsidian Guard&gt;<BR>56 Conjurer,<BR>Master S.T.U.J.<BR>PETS!

</FONT><HR>Okay, this is a "fun" item, but I'd like to support it. The first post after Absor's suggests perhaps using player race models, if possible with the elemental textures. If they can get the textures to work, this would be _awesome_. Though I might add high elf to the wizard, barbarian to the earth, and wood elf to the rogue.

</FONT><HR>Okay, here we go:<P>1. Please do not assign damage from damage shields to the caster.  If it needs to be assigned somwhere, assign it to the person wearing the damage shield.  This would help the tank/melee types with taunts, increasing the value of damage shields to them without doing anything to skill caps or whatnot.<P>2. the ward summoned line - magicians are the masters of summoning.  Currently druids get these spells before magicians, which is wrong in my opinion.  They get banish summoned at 44, exile at 55 and banishment at 60.  Mages get banish at 49, exile at 56 and banishment at 60.  If we know more about creating summoned things, we should be better at destroying them.  It is far harder to create than it is to destroy.  Mages should either get these spells before anyone else, or have more powerful versions of this type of spell.<P>3. Mages should "kick butt" versus summoned creatures.  Currently we don't do anything more or less effectively versus these creature types than anyone else.  See my comment #2.  I would like to see either the level of acquisition AND the mana cost for these spells reduced for mages, or a  wider variety of vs. summoned type spells.  Particularly ranged AE vs. summoned, PB ae vs. summoned, and a very low resist vs. summoned and bigger damage vs. summoned.  When a high level mage walks into someplace like the Hole, the creatures there should be saying "oh sh*t", instead of - oh, another caster.  As an example shock of swords does 600 for 250 mana, and banish summoned does 585 for 225 and casts 1 sec faster.   Char casts 1 sec faster than banish, and does 660 for 260 mana.  It makes it a hard argument to use banish over our other DD spells.  Considering the mage specialties and lack of variety in dd types, they really should excel vs summoned creatures.<P>4.  Mages should be able to charm summoned creatures.  As I understand it, summoning a creature/pet generally means you got that creature from somewhere else, and in the getting you gain control of the creature.  When someone charms a mage pet,  they aren't summoning their own, they are taking control away from  the mage.  I think that it would be fair to conclude that if a mage knows how to summon and control a creature, they should be able to take control from someone else - ie charm summoned.<P>5.  Mages have a limited variety of DD spells - fire and magic.  Since this is all we can use, we should be VERY good at using it - ie resisted less.  Particularly the conjuration spells that save vs fire/magic.  If wizards get reduced resists vs. evocation, its only fair in my opinion that mages get reduced resists in conjuration.<P>6.  Pets - there are only a few issues with pets.<BR>	a. mage pets that cast spells should never, never ever, cast dispels. ever. never. ever.<BR>	b. mage pets literally ARE that element.  they should have NO rival in use of that element. 	    Pets are resisted, particularly at the higher levels, way way too much. I have seen earth	    pets and air pets get resisted 9 and 10 times in a row by low blue conning mobs.<BR>	c. mage fire pets should never do anything to overwrite their innate damage shield.<BR>	d. the casting pets (read - 50+ fire pets) should either stand back and cast, or melee and 	    not cast.  not both - they don't have the hp to melee, and get resisted like no tomorrow.  	    they need help.<P>7.  Pets are a mages defining ability.  Without them we are merely a weak wizard.  Yet 50+, they are drop spells, and several of them are RARE drops.  This is a bad idea.  Personally I think drop spells are a really bad idea in general, because it forces the player to camp certain creatures and/or in certain zones if they want the spell.  Buying from other players is OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive.  I find it hard to believe that Verant is willing to cater to this sort of extortion  (CoH -20,000pp..60 water pet, 20,000pp...54 water pet, 5,000pp, Aegis of Ro - seen offers in excess of 30,000pp).  Most casters spend virtually all of their training points from 16-49 in research skill, and once they get to 50, research has no meaningful value anymore.  the current drop spells should be researchable, with moderately common component drops, occasional rare component drops for those spells that are meant to be truly hard to get, and mages should be able to research or buy their 50+ pets from merchants.  Or quest for them, or have to get to a merchant in a really weird/hard to get to place.<P>Now, on to the post 50 environment:<P>1. mages only have 1 exceptional spell post 50 - Call of the Hero, at 55.  Mages currently have a real problem with value/viability post 50.  We lose our ability to solo, as the mobs start having too many hp, and hitting to hard for our dds and pets to deal with.  We have no means of crowd control, and our sole method of escape is gate. Wizards have far superior DD abilities, other classes have comparable damage shields, leaving our pets as the only real value add, and while they are nice, they are nothing extrordinary.<P>2. there is no real difference in the 51-54 and the 56-60 pets...a couple more points in the max damage area, and a handful more hp.  This needs to be stepped up some, particularly the max hp.  Damage output from a pet is, generally speaking, pretty good.  But the 56-60 pets cost 100 more mana for very little benefit.  They should have a 10-15% increase in max hp and AC.<P>3. the focus items we lugged around from 34-49 don't work on post 50 pets.  The mastery staves are particularly hard to get.  My understanding is that the mastery staves have a bigger impact on pets than the old focus items.  I would like to see the focus items able to work on post 50 pets, or  a quest to turn them in and get upgraded versions that do.  This would pretty much alleviate many of the post 50 pet "strength" issues.<P>4. Mage summons, in a word, bite.  Our most powerful, drop spell only summons are right click effects on armor.  This was a slap in the face.  Our most cherished ability slapped on armor made our summoning powers seem trite.  Sure, not everyone has that armor, but I still find it insulting as a mage.  And to top it all off, the spells we get pre 50 don't get upgraded AT ALL until post 50, if they get upgraded at all.  The only ones that have any logical progression are daggers<P>here is a list of what I mean -<BR>summon bandages at level 4 - next upgrade 51<BR>summon throwing daggers at level 16 - next upgrade at 54<BR>summon spear at level 20 - no upgrade<BR>summon stack food/water at level 20  - next upgrade level 51 and 52 (if you consider bb's bundle)<BR>summon arrows at level 20 - next upgrade at 53<BR>summon sword at level 29 - no upgrade<BR>summon staff at level 34 - no upgrade<BR>summon 6 slot bag at level 34 - next upgrade at 51<BR>summon dagger at level 39 - no upgrade<BR>summon modulating rod at 44 - no upgrade<P>looking at this list, the mage has to generally double to quadruple in level before they see an upgrade.  I recall Verant saying something to the effect these were never meant to be the "defining" ability of mages, merely utility spells meant to add value to the class, or some such.  Personally, I like being able to create things...its one of the main reasons I play a mage.  Our "defining" ability is supposed to be our pets, which come with mixed blessings, as do everyone elses defining abilities.  So post 50, our pets are good, but not great, our utility spells are handed out as effects on armor, other classes can damage shield nearly as well as we can, our vs. summoned line is done BETTER by druids, we have only 2 types of dd, fire or magic, both of which are resisted better by most high level mobs than any other magical attack type, and our sole redeeming feature is a fairly rare drop spell we get at 55.<P>Here is what I see as the way to fix this:<P>1. move CoH from 55 to 51, the same point which NPC's get the ability, and make it more common.<BR>2. push the entire post 50 line of utility summons to pre 50 levels, and add in some truly potent summons post 50.  I mean high value items, like gatestones, bindstones, etc.  Have them use reagents that are expensive, and make them lore.<BR>3. improve the CoH line, with a single target summon across zones (party member) at 55, and a group summon (within same zone) at 60, with increasing reagent costs.  Further expand the line to have a single target "banish" to bind point at 53 and a self only summon corpse at 57. If we can call another person in a zone, I see no reason we can't summon our own corpse in a zone, either.  Some people might say that treads into necro/sk territory - I don't think it does, if it remains as a self only effect.  I can pull all sorts of things out of thin air - why can't I summon myself?<BR>4. add a new spell that creates a non- no rent object that allows another person to summon the mage that created the object.<P>_____ there are tons of summoning suggestions in the other thread, I won't reiterate them here.<P>Mages have no form of escape besides gate and their feet.  That being said, I think that there should be some way of introducing another escape route - perhaps summoned 1 or 2 charge no drop jboots.  I don't believe our pets completely justify the current state of affairs.  Pets cannot handle more than 1 mob at a time, and our lack of crowd control means we are doubly limited for our pets.<P>If Verant actually does follow through with introducing new item summons, they are going to need to be pretty darn good items and/or have some pretty potent abilities.  And personally, I'm willing to shell out the pp for reagents if the effects are worthwhile.  A mages real value has, and always will be in what they can provide for others, not what they can provide for themselves.  While pets may be our defining ability, even pre 50 a mage can generally only solo 1 mob at a time.  A mage should be valued in a group for more than DD and free expendables.<P>Akherat Nahk'Silvermoon<BR>Elementalist to SoC<BR>The Tribunal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR><BR>   I notice there's no mention of possible problems with existing (as opposed to new) summons.  Is that for the other thread?<P>   Rain spells:  It's not just a mage issue.  Grimstaff had a nice post summarizing the problems with them, and he's a wizard, I believe.  Wizards never had problem with pets soaking up a wave in the first place, and they still don't find them useful.  Yes, allowing the spell to do its design target of 3 waves each to 4 targets is more powerful than 1 wave each to 4 targets.  But it's still less powerful than a PB AoE, with unlimited targets.  Resist rates also seem to be a problem.  As with the ranged or PB AEs, rains should become mana-efficient on multiple targets (if you're willing to risk the multiple aggro), but not efficient on single targets.  They're just another form of AE spell, with some additional disadvantages in the form of target limits, time to deal damage, and ability to move out of the AE before damage is done, so it would be expected that the spell is somewhat more efficient than an AE, even, when applied to a full number of targets.<P>   Pets, grouping, and xp:  If pets can count as a group member for division of xp (under whatever circumstances), then won't that be a significant penalty for inviting mages into a group?  It's every bit as unfriendly as the ex-hybrid penalty draining from the group.  If the mage is so well balanced, isn't an xp penalty (solo or grouped) for the use of the pet inappropriate, just as an xp penalty for balanced hybrids inappropriate?  Yes, your friends will group with you anyway.  They did with hybrids, too.  Doesn't mean there's not an inequity there.  Balance = no xp penalty.  Xp penalty needed = imbalanced class.  Which way is it?<P>   Spell drops: The rate seems to be a problem with all classes, not just mages.  50+ casters can't keep up with melee even with their 50+ spells; without them, it's even less useful to bring damage casters along.  Having the pet spells drop (instead of nukes, AEs, bundles, etc) is particularly problematic for mages, since they're not just nice-to-haves, but vital to keep up with the mob inflation curve.<P>   Phantom Armor:  Any chance of getting an eye-candy component so that it looks like you're in leather/chain/plate/something wierd at high level?  No real effect on gameplay, but it would look nifty.  And I'd still like it reworded so that it sounds like conjured armor, and not illusory armor, just to match the class.<P>   Evo vs. Conjuration:  Mages seem like a class that should have a clear-cut choice of specialization.  The druids may well agonize over picking the most useful one, but they're the versatile class.  I'd rather see more Conj-based nukes and fewer Evo.  (And yes, I'm spec'd in Evo.  It'll suck when I have to run off to the Temple of Ro and spend time rebuilding my spec skill.  But it just makes more sense.  Wizards are the Evocation masters; mages should have all the reasons to Conjure instead.)<P>   Level ranges on existing summons: the levels of some summons seem inapppropriate given the power (or lack thereof) of the items.  This is most apparent on the Kunark "fun" spells.  (Its seems as though they were all placed above 50th level since Kunark was a "50+ expansion", even though of course it's not limited to that, and most classes received Kunark spells below level 50.)  Ring of Flight is also noticably higher than any other form of levitation.<P>   Epic quest: one of several in need of some statistical analysis and comparison with other epic quests.<P>   Specific examples of bad pathing:  I'll try and dredge some memories of the most annoying examples I recall.  They'll necessarily be incomplete, since mages learn so quickly not to move with a pet up to avoid all the bad pathing, known or assumed.  You don't learn where the bugs all are!<P>   - Crushbone.  Pets fall in the water a lot.  If you run between the castle wall and the outer zone wall, the pets like to move inside the wall (where the orcs are).<P>   - Befallen.  My main memory here was of pets wandering through doors and 32k'ing themselves when the door shut.  They're not good about sticking close to the master.  The earliest no-move-with pet zone I recall.<P>   - Mistmoore.  The courtyard has some strange issues, particularly on the hill above the lake, or the little notch on the left as you head down the initial ramp, where pets take large angular wanders into the courtyard to get back to you after a fight.<P>   - Sol A.  Pets have trouble with the pathing around the staircases, the "window room" which avoids the swinging blade trap thing, and the path down to the metal doors to the bartender (etc).<P>   - Gorge of King Xorbb.  At the "mino altar" (where evil eyes and Lords Syrkyl, Sviir, Soptyvr spawn, along with minos and muddites) there's lot of odd in-across-out pathing.  From spots at an angle in front of the altar, pets will run around behind the altar and back over to get to the eye spawn points, aggroing any minos that may be back there.  (Eyes and pets do the same on their way to you.)  Creatures that patrol in a circle around the altar have trouble reaching PCs up against the wall.  Simple side to side steps can make mobs run back to the middle, across, and back to you.  (Slow enough to be exploitable, if you're that sort.)<P>   - Yeti caves in Dreadlands.  Monsters or pets have a tendency to wander up the mountainside instead of coming into the cave.  The paths don't seem to quite match the walls, so NPCs sort of "slide" along the paths at partial speed, instead of heading straight down the tunnels.<P>   - Sarnak fort in Lake of Ill Omen.  There's a sort of forward tower with a bridge that's a really fine place to practice pet control.  If you can walk around it and get your pet inside the tower, congratulations!  There's also some place where pets on the top of the tower can be attacked through a wall or from under the world.  I'm not sure where that path goes, because the pet was effectively vanishing, out of range, an "invis now" situation.<P>   - Najena and UGuk.  I remember these as being pretty good.  They're both well into the "move, then pet up" phase, so I haven't fallen into most of the problems, I suppose.  But I do recall running around most of the easier half of UGuk with an air pet up surprisingly successfully.<P>   - Runnyeye.  There's a place just past the goblin warlord + elite guards, off to the right toward the King/Borxx room, where a seemingly infinite amount of goblins get trapped by the wall by the water.  Pets would have the same problem wandering around there, I'm sure.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The only other important point that you left out that I believe is not only important but a matter of class balance is the epic drops in Hate.<P>Even if it is true that you are deliberately trying to make it that only 6 epics per year enter the game, please move the staff off Innorruuk to a mob that spawns with the rest of hate and lower the percentage likelihood of it having the staff.  Considering the amount of ragebringers in the world though (and even our guild, which isn't uber in any sense of the world, has every 45+ rogue twink outfitted with one already), I really don't think 6 per year is fair by any stretch of the imagination.<P>Leo.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ahhh  A magician thread …Thanks &#61514;<P>I would like to say a few things and offer a few suggestions.<P>1. I am not sure where you are coming from with the Solo thing.  We use to be able to solo very well but now our ability to solo is marginal at best and getting worse with each level.  Some of this is the fact that every mage fight is a stand up knock down fight and the MOBs in both of the expansions hit for a LOT more damage (and more hit points) while the pets only got a marginal upgrade.   Wizzies and druids fly past the Mage here as since they kite they negate the tremendous amount of damage a MOB hits for.  Mage DD is still limited in all aspects.  We did not get a good jump in mana efficiency, no unresiestable spells, no fast cast spells, no unbelievable AOEs.  And we still only get 2 types of magic.  Hell even the necromancer got cold in the expansion.  Try to go to Skyfire and solo a few different MOBs  :b<BR>1. I see on Test that you have given us a resist fear spell for our pets and that’s nice.  I also see its 59th and that’s not nice.  We are not allowed to go after Naggy and Vox after 53rd but your not giving us the tools to go after the other Uber MOBs till 59th please think about that a bit.<BR>1. I am a bit upset about our lack of  increased DD compared to our first 50 levels but what really makes me see red is NOT being able to use our pets, and pathing.   Both of these issues have been brought up before and I remember once Gorden even said it was for “balance” (I swear he did say that)  But more and more you require us to rely on our pets to contribute to a fight but set the encounter up so we don’t get to use our pets or they are made useless by the MOBs insane AOE effects (fear being the most common).<BR>1. You want to have class dependence and I guess I can live with that but you have clearly defined certain abilities for certain classes.  Sooo when we get our summons they are crap because there are no “cool” abilities to make into summons for us to have.  All the abilities that could make our summons worthwhile for us and our party are considered “class defining” and taboo for us to have.  I mean lets be honest if we had hrmmm  summons that did SOW and Clarity well we would die less often  :b  Sorry had to say it but really we would be a LOT more desirable in a group and why not? EVERYBODY loves these spells.  Unfortunately we do not have a single summons that is a trademark for us or always usefull.  Its kinda a dream for me.  Druids/shamans get SOW and it’s a wanted and viable spells for them for the rest of their career.  Enchanters get Clarity and it’s the same as SOW.  I would like to have a Mage summon that is like that.  It does not seem to unreasonable to ask for at least 1 summon that is always wanted and used.   Shard of the Core could maybe be like this if you moved it to the ammo slot and made it droppable.<P>This is just a personal thing for me but I would LOVE if all our buffs were made into summons as well.  I am sure I would be a LOT more loved in groups if I could give phantom armor to the Tank. A stone with 1 charge of lava shield on it to the puller.  And the nice thing about this is it would make us more mana efficient as we could summon this stuff between pulls if we happen to have full mana.  Then its stored for later and we get it free.  (Corse you can f00k it up by giving it a 30 second casting time  :b) <P>Pets spells?  I am 55th and still no water pet so you can make your own call on that 1.  <P>Epic item.  I gotta be honest you blew it on this.  I hear other people say its doable and I always think to myself sure its doable. It would be doable if you put it as 10 rare drops off a once a RL year spawning MOB.  But that’s not the point.  It should be as hard as the other epics and in my opinion its about twice that.  I see 50 rouges running around with their epics. My cleric is only 50th and I am 2/3 of the way threw the cleric Epic.  I figure I can get it before I hit 52nd without really stretching to much. <P>To recap fix pet pathing, give us a good summons 1 that will be a trademark summons for my class, make my buffs into summons that I can give to others (and hell if ya do that forget the good summons I think I will have plenty of good summons then), and reduce the Aggro range of Pets to about 5 feet from the pet.  If Pets define us as a class then we should be able to use them everywhere.<P>Thanks for the read<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

In other words, a pet that has been given the ignore command would only attack mobs you told it to; it would not aggro on mobs that attack it or its mage.  For this command alone, I would forgo almost everything else on this list!<P>One other change: ALL BUFFS SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE CLICKED-OFF.  I can cancel Spirit of Wolf at any time by clicking on it, and a couple of others, but not armor/AC buffs.  Yes, normally you'd never want to do this, but SOMETIMES you do.  Please let us do this.  (Especially because I hate when Armor of Faith overwrites my Phantom Armor line!)<P>Now, the rest of it.<P>No Rent Items: Yes!  This would be a perfect fix to the linkdeath solution.  Another solution that has been proposed is to have NORENT bags (summoned Dimensional Pockets and Dimensional Holes, and others) become permanent, NODROP bags, that do not reduce the weight of items inside them, and themselves weigh 30+ pounds.  This helps prevent abuse (distributing free bags to newbies) and also solves the problem.  NORENT items like food and water could be destroyed, but not the bags, since the bags may be holding valuable non-NORENT items (I had a friend put a Staff of the Tranquil inside a summoned bag -- oops!).<P>Rain spells: I never use these, because they are less efficient than my regular DDs.  The only time they are more efficient is when there are no pets being used, which only happens rarely (high level encounters where things can be feared, like Fear plane raids).  Having them not waste a wave on a pet would make me use them regularly!<P>New summoned proc'ing weapons: Might be fun or interesting, but would of course need to have as limited a use as the Sword of Runes does now.<P>Pathing: Here's one thing - change it so that when pets are on pathing, they DON'T PACE BACK AND FORTH.  It's really irritating; it would be nice if they would just sit still.<P>Pets and AoE fear: Instead of immunity to fear (BAD IDEA, this shouldn't be a mage thing, it should be AT BEST a necro spell), make it so that when pets are feared, they turn around and stop attacking, but DO NOT RUN AWAY.  It's not the being feared that's the problem; it's the running away and training things!<P>Pet Names: As long as pet names were subject to the same naming policy as the players, I have no problem with this.  It seems like a lot more effort for Verant (i.e. 50% more name checks to do) but if Verant's okay with that, then as long as the names are subject to the naming policy, I have no problem with that.  Will pet names be global-unique like player names though?  They'd have to be, I imagine.  (If you do implement this, also leave us the ability to have pet names be randomly generated INSTEAD of picking a name, or let us switch back and forth -- sometimes I want to summon Fluffy, but sometimes I just need a Jobaner to deal with something real quick.)<P>Or, as per Deadluvin's idea, name the pet after the master.  "Teramenor pet" is certainly less interesting than "Jobaner" (yes, I do like the random pet name generation), but more useful.  Or make it optional for a user -- I should be able to choose whether I see a pet's "real name" (Jobaner) or whether it displays the owner's name (Teramenor's pet) above the pet.<P>Pet graphics: At high levels, a new model would be cool.  Maybe have our last 4 pets (57-60 spells) be an Efreeti (fire), a Pegasus (Air), a Golem of some kind (Earth) and some kind of water mob model for Water.  Obviously global file restirctions limit this, but I'm sure you guys could think of something clever.  Or maybe just make the high level pets GIGANTIC (I'm talking Ogre-sized -- if my party can have a full size Ogre in Sol B, why can't I bring an Ogre-sized Fire elemental?).  Or, similar to ShaggyHippie's idea, make the high-level pets use the same model as the player - a gnome summons a gnome-shaped pet, high elves summon a high-elf shaped pet, EXCEPT, the pet would have their appropriate elemental skin (so you'd have a high elf completely covered by a fire elemental skin).  That would be cool.<P>Rage of Zomm: That would be neat.<P>DoTs: Don't know.  I would suggest removing them and replacing them with resist debuff DoTs instead.  i.e., a spell that causes a mob's fire resistance to lower by 5 every tick for 20 ticks or something (that's obviously a powerful spell, but in the right situations very useful).<P>Dyzil's: I don't have this spell yet but this seems like a good idea.  Magicians (not me) often clamor for a "quick escape" spell or ability, and this seems like it might fit the bill.  Something to distract the mob long enough for me to run away or Gate.<P>Pet healing: YES!  Our last heal is level 20 and heals 220 hp.  It's useful up to maybe the 40s, but then you get in situations where there are mobs that will do more damage than that *IN ONE ATTACK*.  Therefore the spell is pointless since it's clearly better to chain-summon another pet.  How about a pet complete or superior heal at 52?  Only the complete heal would cost, say, 500 mana, and be your-pet-only, and take 12 seconds to cast.  The advantage to it would be, you wouldn't lose all the buffs your pet has (from resummoning a new pet).  The numbers would need to be adjusted (level, mana cost, casting time) to make this more desirable than summoning a new pet, MOST OF THE TIME, but not 100% of the time.<P>Improved Invis: Yeah, why didn't we get this?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Fear Immunity: NO!!!  See the Pets and AoE fear thing above.  (summary: make pets stop attacking and stand still when feared, but NOT run away, or maybe not run more than 10 feet)<P>Pet Health Bars: Good idea.<P>Voice Graft: PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE let us talk through our pets!!!  This would be SO MUCH FUN!!!  ALL pet classes should get this, since it does not affect game balance in any way, but is purely a fun spell.<P>- Teramenor</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wow I REALLY love these ideas. Elemental Illusion is also a GREAT idea. If these spells were implamented I would think my Mage is alot more fun then the regular, send pet, nuke, step back, nuke etc etc. Pls don't make these all Level 50 plus spell tho. I am finding my magician boring at lvl 35. I don't play 3 hrs a day. I play about 1 hr a day so its harder for me to get to higher lvls so if I get cool spells now That would be great</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Summoning.  Lets get some No Rent items into the game that are good.  Its No Rent, these items will not stay in the game so there should be no way that they can be overpowering.  I can't even summon a bow for my arrows.  Some suggestions that I have:<P>Summon Bow<BR>Summon Haste Item.  Not all melee characters have haste items and maybe a non melee character would want one.  Ever seen a druid atk..hehe, bet he would like one.<BR>Summon items with infinte charges.  There is no reason that a staff of see invis should only hold 4 charges.<P>Some itmes with infinite effects could be:<BR>See Invis<BR>Cast Invis<BR>Endure breathing<BR>Levitate<BR>ColdStone but how bout an item that gives us the buff so it doesnt take a ranged slot?<P>There is no reason that the above items should have a finite amount of charges, they should be infinte..they are No Rent remember.  Maybe we should forgo having 'uber' melee itmes if the effect is worthwhile.  The user wouldnt 'use' the weapon for melee, but would use the effect.<P>Some other ideas that come to mind:<BR>Summon Shield (would have a +10 resist to an element, maybe not good AC but the resist is situational)<P>So in summary, IMHO the class (besides the rain issues which others seemed to have talked about) the class is fun to play by myself.  But frankly no one talks to me anymore, like they did when I would summon the Sword of Runes.  I met a lot of nice people last year because of those swords..now about the only people I meet are then silly human monkeys asking for Cold Stones.  Anyways, my input into this thread is Summoning.  Give us something to summon please.  Something that people really want, something that has infinte charges so I dont have to keep dropping staffs on the ground (I look like a druid sometimes dropping all those lev rings).  <P>In conclusion, the items themselves atm do not take much mana to cast, so why do they have limited charges...just makes it boring casting 100 lev rings and then jungling the used ones with the good ones.  Create summoned itmes that are situational, my example was to create + resist items (a shield perahps) ; this would be extremley situational.  Create summoned items that have a finite charge, create very situational itmes (i.e. the + resistance gear, shield wearable by all classes)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here's the full story on AE Rain spells<P>This spell line, like all AE spells, had a larger area, and had no maximum number of targets. All AE spells had their mana cost raised, damage lowered, and the areas and maximum targets reduced. AE Rain spells were FURTHER weakened by making them not hit with the correct number of waves. <P>Instead of hitting up to the maximum number of targets (4 now) with up to 3 waves each, it works like this, optimally:<BR> <BR>1 target = 3 waves hit<BR>2 targets = 2 waves hit each<BR>3 targets = 1 wave hits each, with 1 extra wave on a single target<BR>4 targets = 1 wave hits each target<BR> <BR>Now, as you can see, unlike ALL other AE spells, the more targets you get, the more inefficient and more poor the spell becomes. As a result, the AE Rain spells are junk. In addition, the AE Rain spells actually hit with EVEN FEWER waves indoors than they did out doors.<BR> <BR>In the Fall of 1999, Verant made an adjustment to the rain spells that made them hit more indoors, so they were the same as outdoors, but were still limited to 4 maximum waves, no matter how many targets.<BR> <BR>In January, after repeated pleas, comments, and complaints, GZ Finally responded to Graffe, Baelish and I with an email that said, in effect, "wow, it does that? It's not supposed to, we'd like to fix that before Kunark comes out, AE Rain spells will feature heavily in that!" <P>In other words... they are broken. GZ was the guy in charge of spells then, the Archmage. Geoffrey Zatkins, works for Verant. Then after months of waiting we got no word, nothing was done, they STILL didn't work properly. So we brought that up AGAIN to GZ and he responded to Graffe with this (approximately) "We are going to get to those, but we can't right now, can't give you an ETA." <P>So we stand right now at that point. AE Rain spells have these three problems: <BR>-Hit with too few waves<BR>-Hit pets<BR>-Resisted more than individual blasts <BR>The last two are shared with all AE spells, but they are AE Rain spell problems<P>On the test server, they are testing the idea of having pets not be counted as valid targets to AE Rain spells (and possibly other AE spells, people seem to be unaware they are a valid target for those too).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, you seem to be pretty much on the mark there with most of the issues, here is my take on some of them.  I'll try to keep it short and sweet.<P>No Rent Items:  <BR>&gt;&gt;&gt;making No Rent items disappear on log in instead of log out, and only if the last log in time was more than 30 minutes prior. <P>Dont you mean - and only if the last log OUT time was more than 30 minutes prior?  Otherwise this is still not a fix.  If I log in and play for 35 minutes then go LD, when I log in my items would poof based on what you stated?<P><BR>Rain Spells: <BR>Obviously being worked on on test as far as removing pets from the equation, but resistances do seem a bit high.  Even in the rare cases that I do use one (on giants occasionally), even a malised foe frequently resists 2 out of 3 waves.<P><BR>New Summoned Proc’ing Weapons: <BR>I guess this would be nice, but would rather see new weapons with useful effects, or put effects on weapons that make sense. ie, most casters have see invis so would not ask for a staff with that effect, melee types who could use see invis would probably rather have it on the sword you just gave them than on a staff they wont use.  <P>Please change summoned weapons so that we have more 1hb throughout our careers, this is what we actually use!<P><BR>Pathing: <BR>One of the biggest reasons pets are often forbidden.  I am hard pressed to think of ANY dungeon where the pathing is good.  Velious dungeons do not seem to have any noticable improvement.  Is there any way to improve the issue with the Z-axis?  Particularly in Velious I have had pets just pop way up or way down into a dungeon for no apparent reason other than possible undiscernable holes in the ether that only pets can find. <P><BR>Spell Drops: <BR>Lvl 54 Water pet is ridiculously rare! Not sure the lvl of mobs it drops from is wrong though.  I have heard of it dropping (once) in Skyfire.<P>Pet Names: <BR>This would be a "fun" addition.  Hope it can be done, maybe it can be assigned in the eqclient.ini file or something?<P>Pet Graphics: <BR>Would settle (I guess) for a new graphic on the epic pet that few people will ever see, but it would be much nicer if some of the non-epic post 50 pets had a different look to them.<P><BR>DoTs: <BR>Doesnt make much sense really, but I'll take these spells vs. nothing.  It would have been nicer to see a brand new idea with the expansion.<BR>I would personally like to see our "master of elements" role played up a bit more.  Others have suggested fear type spells or whatever vs. elementals.  I dont care for that idea, but charm might be cool, or any other creative idea that shows we are in control when it comes to this area.<P><BR>Higher level pet healing spell: <BR>This line really should have been continued, at around 44 and say, 55?  However, the mana cost should be along the same ratio as before.  If you are saying we should have to choose between healing our pet or summoning a new one, then that heal should be a CH for the pet if the mana cost will be similar.  Instead, I believe it should just be a lower mana cost that still gives an effective heal, enough to save your pet for the last bit of that fight, but not so much as to be equivalent to summoning a new pet.  What would be the point?  I just want to know that if Im low on mana and the mob is almost dead, that I can give one last boost of health to my pet and possibly win the fight.  Those are the situations where it counts, not when you would have enough mana to summon a new pet anyway.<P>Improved Invisibility: <BR>Yeah, why don’t magicians get this spell?<P><BR>Pet Fear Immunity spell: <BR>Yay! And I am not against necros getting this too, however I disagree with the logic that it makes sense they should get it.  They are masters of fear, not resisting fear (courage).<P><BR>Pet Health Bars: <BR>A little blue bar in our health bar that represents the pet, just like the xp one would be nice!  <P>Other thoughts:<P>I see absolutely no reason/use for magicians having elemental illusion spells.<P>I would venture to guess that the number of mages who specialize in evocation is not lesser than those who specialize in conjuration.  I say leave those spells alone and, as pointed out, let folks opt to do the specialization changing quest at the temple of sol ro.  No need for a change here.<P>Im tired and sick. Hope you can decipher what I wrote =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I don't really have much to say on this subject other than I think it would be fitting for Magicians to have these spells too. Druids get to look like wolves, Shamen get to look like Bears, Necromancers get to look like skeletons, Magicians should get to look like Elementals. Just seems natural to me."<P>Um no.  Druids *turn into* wolves and shamans *turn into bears* because of their closeness to nature etc, Necromancers *turn into* skeletons / spectres because of their relation ship to the dead.  You summon elementals, that should not allow you to turn into an aelemental or to look like one.<P>Besides, those are the only unique models enchanters get, and even some of those can be gained with items. ANd warewolf of course, but bards can get an item to turn into that also.<P>Back to magicians: I have always liked the idea of a spell <BR>Summon Bind Wand<BR>lore no rent<BR>1 charge of self only bind<P>It would also be nice if at higher levels (~34-44)they could summon bandages that healed more per attempt than normal ones do. <P>lvl 60 spell summon spell crystal:<BR>lore no rent<BR>1 charge capture spell<P>(possible lvl 39 or so spell: lore no rent no drop same effect)<P>Hardest to code but would be really nice, basically it is an item that would hold one charge of one spell, if the crystal is in hand when the spell is cast the spell effect is stored instead of being cast.  It can then be used later without mana or taking up a spell slot (Same casting time, regent used when spell stored?).<P>Maybe there should be two of these, one at 39 that summons a no drop one, and one at 60 that summons a dropable one.  Both should be lore no rent.  The lower level one might help with the concerns of magicians about no escape spells, the crystal could have their gate or pet in it so when they are out of mana and need to run they can do something.

</FONT><HR>You are leaving off one of the main issuses that many mages complained about in the older mage discussions.<P>The damage output of the magician class past 50th is subpar to the melee classes. Even in the upper 40s the damage is getting low. Magicians dont have any defense spells, we are an offence class. When we get jumped by a mob, if we dont have our pet we are dead, all other casters have spells to save themselves.<P>The post 50 pets are hardly upgrades to the 49th level ones. Thier damage output is slightly higher and they hae slightly more HP. Melee classes damage goes up significantly past 50th, yet mages damage output goes up very little.<P>Our post 50th damage spells are less mana effecient than Lava bolt and do less damage. At 53 we get char, it does less damage for a worse mana ratio than lava bolt, the only thing it has going for it is that it is a DD spell. At 54 we get scar of sigil, once again less damage and worse mana ratio than even char and is a bolt. The magician spells need to have lower mana costs or higher damages or both.<BR>Magicians do less damage than even warriors in groups. This is counting damage from pets, spells, and damage shields. A group is better off bringing another warrior along than a magician. The magician adds nothing extra usefull to a group untill they hit level 55 and get CoH.<P>""Because of their pets, they are welcome enough in any group""<BR>This is false, this makes us not wanted in groups. Pathing and aggro and general control issues make most groups wery of bringing a pet caster into it. Mobs will attack the pet from a longer range, an the pets wandering around aimlessly from pathing problems makes this even worse.  Abashi used to tell us that our pets were so powerful because of all these problems... now that our pets have remained the same power and melees have become much stronger, what is the reasoning for these problems?<BR>Many raids are not magician friendly. Our pets cant be used because of the above problems and mobs resists are so high to the point we are lucky to land a spell. This reduces magicians to manawhores and damage shielders. And with 10 tanks to shield, they become almost worthless.<BR>The resists are a casterwide problem, not just magician. All casters are hurt by the creation of mobs that are extreamly resistant to spells. This makes melees required to do damage to most high level mobs, and melees already have the benifit of doing more damage than all caster classes.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You missed one: The mage epic is impossible to get for 99.99999999999999% of the 50 up Mages.<BR>Totally Impossible.  And You will probably never see a mage with an epic on the new non-transfer servers.<BR>Most important IMO is the 52 fire pet is worthless.  You say that a mage is highly desireable in a group at all levels?  51 to 60 try again... If you don't have the epic spell (GFL) or Call of hero, you might as well start forming your own group, because you won't be invited.<P>Main reasons:<BR>Most pets are worthless in the 51 up dungeons due to bad pathing.  This Makes the Mage a High Mana cost Weak Wizard.  This means that the only time ppl will invite a mage along, would be when they could do the spot where they are going with 5 ppl, but the exp bonus and the extra bit of nuking will make it okay to bring a tagalong with.<P>Lol  Level 50 up Mages solo in Velious... ROFL!  Maybe if I chain cast 20 pets and I get them all off with perfect timing.  I might be able to solo one mob here.<P>Mages can solo still... But the pet NERFS you made went way overboard the other way.  You gave Druids back their kiting ability... Give us back our pets.<P>Critter Snack 47 Gnome Mage Tholuxe Paells<BR>Comblast Fizzes 55 Druid Prexus<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Thanks for the reminder, Subjugator.<P>OUR EPIC QUEST IS *RIDICULOUS*.  Ragebringer (Rogue), the Water Sprinkler of Nem Ankh (Cleric)... these quests can be done in a couple of days if you have enough people supporting you.  Average time for the Mage epic, if you don't have any of the items you need when you start it, is about THREE MONTHS.<P>Two items are utterly ridiculous:<P>1. The Pegasus Feather Cloak from Quillmane.  This isn't so bad, because a few days camping SK with some tracker friends will probably net you the cloak.  Still, it's a lot of time and effort and incredibly BORING.  Wandering around SK at 49 killing everything in sight is not any fun at all.  It's just a waste of time.<P>2. The Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth.  This makes the PFC look like child's play.  This item has a *MAXIMUM* drop rate of once per week, assuming Innoruuk drops it every week.  Of course, he doesn't, it's more like a 5-10% chance.  Which means on average, one will drop every 10-20 weeks, or less than 3-5 times PER YEAR (this doesn't take server drops and repops into account, but AT BEST that increases the drop rate slightly).  You have to do the following to get it:<P>- Go on a Hate raid<BR>- Innoruuk has to be up<BR>- The raid has to kill him<BR>- He has to drop the staff<BR>- You have to win the roll against any other mages on the raid (except on the rare, RARE chance that they already have the staff).<P>It's just unfair.  Any rogue or cleric can get their epic with a significant amount of effort, but in an almost guaranteed short period of time.  Mages have to spend *hundreds* of hours in Hate if they want a reasonable chance at getting their epic.  It is simply unfair, and for no good reason (it's not like the mage epic is much, if any, more powerful than the rogue epic!).<P>Please, move these two items to more common mobs, or change which items are needed, or SOMETHING to make it so that the epic isn't simply about RANDOM CHANCE.  The only way a mage can get his epic is if he is PURELY LUCKY.  It has NOTHING TO DO WITH SKILL.  It is 100% PURE LUCK.  And that SUCKS.<P>- Teramenor<BR>(http://matt.waggoner.com/orbofmastery.html -- shameless plug :P)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok well allot to say here.<P>AS before when i have mentioned this when the pet nerf (fix) went into affect there was no more weaps to give pets to fight mobs.  I have noticed when i give a 51 war pet runed swords or FS longswords the max dmg done is 54.  But when the pet fights with fist the max dmg is 56. Also i give a 53 monk pet mana rod (24 dly 8 dmg 1hb) the monk pet maxes dmg out to 49 vers 56 again.  When it uses fist its 56 dmg.<P>We need to have it set up so that like the classes in game when the pets increase in lvl (lvl of spell) that the mele abilities are carried forward.<P>It would be nce to see the 4 other seplls of summoned weapons.  Give each spell the same ability as a pet. EXAMPLE<P>44 sword of flame<BR>1hs 9 dmg 24 dly effect flame bolt (47 dmg dd)<P>49 Sword of earth<BR>1 hs 9 dmg 23 dly effect grasping root (roots plus 50dd)<P>51 Mace of sky<BR>1 hb 10 dmg 24 dly effect stun 60dd<P>53 dagger of water<BR>1hp 8 dmg 20 dly effect lightning 75 dd<P>With these spells will allow mages the abilitie to be able to fight diffrent mobs and thier pets get the ability to due damage to diffrent mobs in game.<P>AS to the FIRE Pets issues i have the 52 fire pet and it does fine.  50% of the spells stick once the mob is malosied.  And for mele damage how many wizards do emel dmg i think 30 dmg mele is good enough for this pet.  Remeber this is a wizard pet not a monk or war.  the 200+ dd spells are nice to have but get resisted allot.  Personally i use 54 water and 51 war more than 52 fire.<P>Pet nnames i like the idae of it saying the casters name.<P>IE Majie PET.<BR>There are allot of ways this is helpfull for one on raids we can point to the person hay your pet is on xxx mob.  would be real nice for raids.<P>PATHING can we say OMG.  i doubt anything can be done about this i just reclaim pets then move to another area re make pet untill we move then reclaim and remove.  Yeah it would be nice to get the pathing fixed but im not holding my breath.<P>--------------------------------------------------Pet Graphics: How about a new graphic for high level magician and enchanter pets, something to match the spectre for the necros. At least can we look into getting an interesting look for the epic pet, something like the original appearance (this thing looked pretty cool the first time out, then something bad happened and it lost its cool looks)?<BR>-------------------------------------------------<BR>This idea i love.  The texture of the mob to reflect the class.  Thsi would be awesome but to give us something to shoot for how about making it so the last 5 pets you get this look. (epic and 57-60 pets).<P>I like the idea floating around to allow mages to change shape to allow us to look like our pets.  This wouldnt be an unbalaancing issue.  but an added bonus.  say start at lvl 50 and go up. After all arent we the masters of the elements?<P>so @ lvll 50 you get elemental earth.  grants the wearer the same abilites as an earth elemental.<P>@ 52 you get elemental fire,<P>@ 54 you get elemental air.<P>and finally @ 56 you get elemental water.<P>As far as changing specilization i think the elemental dots should be conjurtion based and all the shock spells (i think they are) but i belive the bolt spells and anything fire based minus dmg shield should be evocation based. The reason why is the pureest form of a fire spell is evocation game wide.  it would be a fundemental change and it really isnt needed.  <P>And Finally the issue of our AC buff being over writen by clerics.  Please make it so that it isnt overwriten by thier AC buff.  Its is anoying as heck to be in a zone and some noob cleric cast SOW on you and removes your regen!!!!  Please fix this so that we have to click off the spell (phantom armor lvl 52) in order for cleric to cast SOW on us.  Also phantom armor is over riden when a high cleric cast aegolism.  can it be made for these 2 to stack?<P>AS for playing a mage i love it.  None of the sugestions i have made will really affect game balance or unballance the class.  I do like the new added spells that are getting introduced on test.  <P>*****one last thing  Make the cloak off the pegasus in SK dropable.  And increase the drop rate for staff off inny.  It has been a while since the staff has dropped off him.********<P>MAJIE 55 mage of POVAR<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055885-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055885-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055885-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055885-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055885-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055885-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055885&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055885&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
