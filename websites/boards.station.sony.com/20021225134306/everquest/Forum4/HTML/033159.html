I started playing EQ over Thanksgiving, amazing how quickly I got hooked.  So much to learn! I have a few questions and such.<P>I have started an ogre shaman(ess) on the Tribunal server.  Seems there are few low level players in the area - in about 50 hours of play I have spoken with about 5 players, and been in 3 small groups.  Is this normal? Frankly, I was hoping for more interaction.  I must say that the few I have talked with have been wonderful folks, and the high level players running by have been very generous with spells (the first time one cast at me, I ran for Oggok, thinking I was being attacked! &lt;blushes furiously&gt; ).  In the meantime I am learning to solo a bit - scary, that is.<P>More questions...<P>1) Since most every skill can be advanced by just working at it, when and why would one spend those training points?<P>2) I misallocated my initial bonus a bit (according to some subsequent guides I read).  How badly will I miss those 5 points I didn't put into Wisdom as I "age"?  I am level 7 now, not too late to start over...<P>3) Many of the guides I have found seem a bit dated.  Do people still practice the trades for fun and profit? Is fishing worth pursuing (seeing that I can summon food with a spell)?<P>4) I live in a ^&%#$ swamp - why can't I forage for water, for the lova Pete! Getting tired of spending silvers for water flasks for brewing...<P>I have many other questions, but am going to try to find answers elsewhere in these boards.  I have lots of time for the boards while I wait for my new computer to come - my old game machine crashed Tuesday, and I have been EQ-less for 2 days - will these cravings never abate!<P>Rogtua, Ogre Shaman (Sheman? Shamen? Shamaness?), 7th level<BR>(me no eat dwarfs!)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Mostly people reserve their other trainer points to get a head staret on tradeksills. You can train up to level 21 in the tradeskills at your guild trainer.<P>2) You will not miss those 5 point sof WIS. They will be very easy to get back with items.<P>3) Yes a lot of peopel do tradeskills for fun. Tehre is very little profit to be madfeint he tradeskill suntil ve high levels of those skills which take an extremely great amount of work to get to<P>4) Some classes can forage and some races get forage as a skill. Ogres do not get forage and shamans do not get forage so, yes, you will have to buy or summon your water.

It is rewarding once you start selling high end trade items, but it takes a long time to get up there.  <P>Dont worry about those 5 points of wisdom.  At least its not 20 points you didnt allocate.  As mentioned, items can get that back, as a shaman, alot of items you will be looking for will have wisdom built in.  Also, you get cannibalize, so you have an extra source of mana in your health bar.<P>As for foraging...  alas, no one person is all powerful in everquest.  As a cleric, I often wish I could track, forage, tank mobs, etc, but thats what EQ is all about, grouping up to combine abilities between people to reach a common goal.  Dont worry though, food isnt that expensive, and as you mentioned, you can summon food and drink as a shaman, saves some money, and more importantly, saves alot of trips to town to find more grub.<P>As for your time spent with other players... as you level up, you will find more people.  Ferrott isnt that populated of a zone, and the lower levels are more designed to get aquainted with the basics of the game before you start grouping.  Solo up a lil bit till you get to your early to mid teens, then start exploring the world a bit.  You will be on your way to being a great group shaman in no time.<P>Enjoy your time on EQ, you will probably be spending alot of time on it, hehe<P>Anidien Angelight<BR>62 High Priest of Tunare<BR>Fennin Ro Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Seems there are few low level players in the area <P></font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, ogres are a relatively rare choice for race, so you get proportionally fewer newbies in that area than in the newbie zones for, say, elves or humans. The high levels yuo see are mostly headed towards the temple of cazic thule, or the plane of fear, both which have entrances in your newbie zone.<P>Secondly, there isn't much in the way of low level dungeons near where you start - so newbies of other races have no reason to travel there to hunt. They'll also have trouble buying and selling with the merchants - since your ogre NPCs will tend to bash first and think later.<P>Finally, ther lower levels go much more quickly than the higher ones, so there are always vastly more higher level players than lower level. You should expect to be around level 15 before you can regulararly find groups of the appropriate level.<P>And where to find these groups? Well, as soon as the wandering creatures in the feerott cease to be a threat, it's time for you to do some travelling. Assuming you don't have the planes of power expansion, you can either head (via paths from Oggok) to the rathe mountains, then on through lake rathe to south karana. This is a good hunting zone for level 15+, and you should be able to find a lot of players with similar level there. Be wary in both lake rathe and rathe mountains, since both these zones have creatures that are way above your level and will kill you on sight.<P>Alternatively, you can head the opposte way along the path, through Innothule swamp, into the Southern desert of Ro then across it to Oasis. This is the safer journey - so long as you watch for sand giants - but will support your levelling for less time (by 20 you'll be ready to move again).<P>If you have Luclin, paludal caves are probably the way to go - quickest way there is to take the route I mentioned to south karana, then cross the plains into north karana and wait by the spires. Once you hit the nexus ask for directions - it's one of the busiest zones and you'll have no trouble finding help.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Casters (and Shaman fall into this class) may want to dump some into their weapons skill (which for a Shaman I would suggest you stick with Piercing as that is the skill your Epic Weapon will eventually use) if they notice that raising too slowly.  But like other s have said many use their points to get a leg up on the trade skills they choose - I believe you cna put 20 or 25 into a trade skill when you atart.<P>Also if you see a skill rasiing too slowly for your liking feel free to put a few practicepoints into it to give it a boost - just rememebr that not all practice point increases are free - the screen that you use these points to boost skills will tell you when they start costing money and how much the next one will cost.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">2) I misallocated my initial bonus a bit (according to some subsequent guides I read).

He is now level 50 and doing quite well for himself.  But I must add that I am not one to try and be <B>the Uberest</B> or one to try and max out stats but work on them gradually over time - I believe his Wisdom is around 175 or so at the moment.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><font face="Verdana, Arial" size="2">3) Many of the guides I have found seem a bit dated.

But that being said, many do trade skills for fun - few do it for profit as unless you have tons of time to spend selling stuff, will not happen.<P>Fishing is very cool trade skill to persue for fun and to help with the food situation (my casters that can summon food and water do not as it becomes tedious to have to summon food and water <B>every time</B> you log on.

Do not underestimate your ability to solo at lower levels.

You will become eligible for this skill at level 25, and may raise it by 5 points per level afterward (cap is 5 at 25, 10 at 26, 15 at 27, etc.).  Investing practice points here instead of actually making low-end potions will save you a healthy chunk of change.<P>While alchemy and fishing are of debatable value in game, they are certainly worth trying as a first-timer.  Exploration is at least half the fun of this game.<P>Make sure you put one point into channeling (eligible at level 4), one into meditate (level 8), and one into dodge (level 14, I think) when you have the chance.  The skills will go up on their own after that.<P>You probably don't need to worry much about grouping until after level 10, at least.  However, as a shaman, you are a strong soloist all the way through level 65.  As you enter your teens, you will learn to use Root (level 4), slows (Drowsy, level 4), and your damage-over-time (DoT) spells like Sicken (level 5) and Tainted Breath (level 9).<P>Look into some quests for your class as well.  If you are a follower of Innoruuk, you can do the Innoruuk clerical symbol quests in the dark elven city of Neriak.  The third symbol is extremely good as it will allow you to cast a very useful spell that doesn't appear in the shaman spellbook (darkness -- reduces enemy movement speed).<P>BTW, the word "shaman" is gender-neutral, though some females prefer "shamaness" for emphasis.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Dalthorn<BR>&lt;Outsider Domination&gt;<BR>The Seventh Hammer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Have been restraining this impulse (so far) when it comes to training points, as they are so few.  I did put the point into channeling when I could, and have "seen" it increase already.  Will do the same soon for meditate.<P>Weapon skills: read that it was good for a shaman to have 1HB, 2HB, open hand and piercing.  It is going to be dificult to keep all these at (or even near)level for a class used more for healing and buffing in groups, unless huge amounts of TPs are dumped into them.  I understand the piercing for the epic weapon, and the open hand for corpse retrieval (shudders).  Why the 2HB? I haven't even been able to afford a 2HB weapon yet! I did "score" a spear as loot, but have not yet poked it at anything. Spears seem weak and rather un-ogrish to me. <P>Also need clarification: book published "with Verant's support" said weapon skills max around 100 for a shaman (75 for open hand).  Sites I have visited say around 200.  Which is correct?<P>And finally (for now at least): open hand skill and 2HB - does the secondary weapon slot have to be empty to use these skills, or can one hold a shield/lore item?<P>Thanks again for all (helpful) responses.<P>Rogtua</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

As you noted, this is in fact tough to do in a group where you play a support role.  So, to achieve this, you will probably have to spend at least some time soloing (or maybe pairing with a rogue) each level or two so that you have a better chance to hit and be hit.  Low blue cons are best for this kind of practice since they usually aren't too threatening (and greens generally won't give you skill ups at all).  Use fast (low delay) weapons for combat practice; this is more important when your skill is way below max.  Make sure you use your AGI and DEX buffs -- and eventually your haste spells -- when practicing as well.<P>If you find that it's impractical to practice all your weapon skills, it's quite safe to neglect hand-to-hand, since your spells will provide you more than enough protection on corpse runs.  It's probably safe to neglect 2hb as well, since there are so many nice off-hand items you can't use while holding a two-hander.  Try to keep at least your 1hb and piercing up though.<P>You can use a shield or other item in your off hand while working on your hand-to-hand skill.  In fact, since shamans can't dual wield, you gain no combat benefit from unequipping your off-hand item.<P>As for EQ strategy guide books, well, let's just say they're fairly notorious for being outright wrong -- or at least, they were before and during the time of the Kunark release.  The web has many good and current resources.  Here are a few useful sites:<P>Spells and research -- Casters Realm -- <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com" TARGET=_blank>http://eq.castersrealm.com/</A><BR>Quests and equipment -- Allakhazam's Magical Realm -- <A HREF="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/" TARGET=_blank>http://everquest.allakhazam.com/</A><BR>Monsters and factions -- Illia's EverQuest Bestiary -- <A HREF="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/" TARGET=_blank>http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/</A><BR>Maps -- EQ Atlas -- <A HREF="http://www.eqatlas.com" TARGET=_blank>http://www.eqatlas.com</A><BR>Tradeskills -- EQ Traders Corner -- <A HREF="http://www.eqtraders.com" TARGET=_blank>http://www.eqtraders.com</A><P>According to Casters Realm, shaman weapon skills cap at 200, except for hand-to-hand which caps at 75 (making it even more useless).<P>As for spears not being ogrish...well, that rusty spear may look puny, true; but rest assured you'll find some nice, hefty ones later on.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Dalth</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
