</FONT><HR>There is a story on the rant site of www.lumthemad.com. It claims that some poster decided it would be a good idea to post up Verant's Guide Policies on a non-VI/Sony site and was banned.<P>Well, good for Verant. I actually think someone who is caught violating a NDA or something of this nature should get banned, regardless of where they posted.<P>What I find unbelieveable is the article claims that ANYONE who posted even a reply to the thread was tracked down and banned!<P>It claims that Verant employees stated the site owner released the IP's of all posters involved and Verant banned the user's based on this information. Problem is the site owner posted his own thread, denying Verant's claims and asking for a VI rep to contact him.<P>Is any of this true? I personally find many of Verant's past actions offensive and thoughtless, but I refuse to believe even VI could stoop so low or they would make false claims.<P>Frankly, I will be amazed if this is true.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

So, you know they could SEND GAME INFORMATION TO YOUR COMPUTER SO YOU CAN PLAY THE GAME?<P>Anyone that visits my website, I get much the same information. How do you think Verant can validate "someone stole my name and password" claims? Bob in california has a 5 month history of logging in with IP adresses from a 20 address range, suddenly this IP address in Europe is using the account, just like he claims...<P>IP NUBMERS ARE NOT RANDOM.

</FONT><HR>I believe what sunli was trying to describe was a dynamically assigned IP address.<P>Yes, you can tie an IP address to a message board posting if you have the IP address that the message was posted from. Even if the IP address was dynamically assign, you generally will see a trend in the user using the same set of IP blocks.<P>If a message originated from an IP in the same or near same IP address block as the IP that the user plays everquest from, you can conclude that the author of the post is the same as the everquest player, assuming the author's posting name is the same as one of their characters.<P>Basically, Verant would have had to contact someone from the message board to divulge the IP address of the poster if those IP addresses were not publically available. Once they received the IP address, they would compare it to their own logs of that account and make the conclusion.<P>I am, in no way, opposing or supporting any side to this issue. I am merely stating that it is possible to prove, with reasonable certainty, that a message board poster can be confirmed to be a particular player given the IP addresses and usernames used by that player.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

They couldn't trace them directly, so what did they do ?  Close their DB to anyone from AOL.<P>Well what does this have to do with anything... well, following the links... the offenders did this from an AOL Account.  You know the ones you can get for free, and then delete it.  Neither Verant or anyone could have pointed the fingers to a specific person.  Only AOL could have done that.<P>That said...  If Verant did ban people on bad information, well...  they won't look good yet again.  If all this is BS, I hope Verant does seek the BS people for the bad reputation they are trying to spread.<P>Either way...  It would be good for Verant to say some type of response on this.

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;This is so false. No way Verant could tell my EQ name from my IP address.

(theres alot of hoopla going around this thread)<P>- YOu pay extra for a static IP, if you DONT have a static IP then when you log off, poof that IP is used by someone else who logs on in a few seconds... cant trace it back to you very easily... they could get court orderd rights to search your ISPs logs but they dont have the time to do that<P>- So you have a static IP, and posted on that site... Yes they could easily find out exactly who you are, where you live, and YES your EQ login... how?  Simple you put your name and address in your account info for EQ, they get your Name and Address from your ISP and viola they have your EQ login and it is now banned.  <P>- VI wouldnt do this, becuase it would take days to ban just ONE person.

Remember the saying actions speak louder than words.  They can say they care, can say they are open, can say alot of things. After the Mystere fiasco, they said they would handle things better.   Then something like this is done.  What would you believe, actions? or words?  <P>On a side note about ip address.  I used to run a chat server on Palace.  They had logs that I would import into a database.  A client type program like eq is, will usually assign a code that is unique for each computer. Everytime you log on, that code is logged along with ip, screen name ect.  If they have an ip addy, all that needs to be done is a simple lookup,  You can also you masks so you can look up 125.23.45.*.  PPL with dsl that always have same IP, are easy to find.  They can also do searches and see how many different screen names have been logged on from the same computer etc.  To make a long story short, finding an ip addy is easy.  Linking up ip addies to eq screen names, is not perfect, but can be done.  <P>I just hope that this is false.

However I do not believe verant would bother the madness has to stop somewhere and I don't think Verant has crossed that line yet ?<P>Yes ISP's do keep logs of who was connected to what port and what IP addresse was used for that port and the user that was logged in. In fact most ISP's keep these logs for at least a year and ever since the Federal government mandated them to in their battle agaisnt Porn of the younger type on the web. For the record an ISP using a proxy server has nothing to do with the IP the person uses. Each person that Connects is assigned a IP address, this isn't a LAN situation we are talking about here.<P>Question is can Verant get this info from the ISP ? that is the only feasable way to quickly track down people.<P>Do I believe this ?

</FONT><HR>Sunli, you are comparing apples and oranges. I can't track you because I do not know what IP address you are posting from.<P>When a person plays everquest, their IP address is logged. Different ISPs use different address pools. I work at a small ISP and we have about 144 dialup lines and have that many IP addresses assigned to them.<P>If someone were to log into EverQuest from any of those addresses, they would be logged on Verant's side as having come from one of those IP addresses. If that same person posted on a message board with the same name as one of their characters, but using a different IP address from our address pool, you can infer that it was him because the IP address range is limited for us, being a small ISP.<P>Many larger ISPs regionalize their IP address pools to ease assignment so one internet user can use a very small address pool every time they connect to their ISP.<P>Some providers have a huge address pool (AOL for example), and it is difficult to say for certain that 2 different examples of usage from the same large address pool are the same person.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/026692-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/026692-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/026692-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/026692-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/026692-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/026692-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=026692&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=026692&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
