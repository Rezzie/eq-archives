</FONT><HR>In reply to RhiannanPovar,<BR>   <BR>  I am among the smaller race warriors, I am of the Dwarven race. Last I checked I dont have hide, sneak, forage, or slam. I think that if anything is done to the war class it would be to the bennifit of the class as a whole. I really doubt VI will give a halfling something like slam. But hey where does that leave me. Good faction maybe, Yippe! &lt;sarcasm&gt; I doubt bickering amoungst our selves will get us anything. <P>  I would love to see sheilds as back equiped for the war. That would make as now stands a useless item worth while. It Doesnt seem right that a war does not have a shield. I think making taunt work a little better would be nice also, Wouldnt really get us exp faster or anything just help us do our job.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am in full agreement with many of the items brought forth in this discussion, and I am glad to see that many are well written and well thought out. as a lvl 44 warrior, I understand that we are a "staple class' and I admit I have little trouble finding a group. But I do agree with many items involving the adjustments mentioned in this discussion. If it counts for anything, I doubt seriously that the ppl making the decisons about warriors being "well balanced" have spent anytime trying to obtain a level past 40 in this class. :&gt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>After reading many of the responses over the last day, there were a few points I wanted to throw my 2 cents in on...<P>1) Taunt: While an AE Taunt is an interesting concept, I really don't think this necessarily falls under the category of 'needed for balance'. As a few have pointed out, class composition of your group and player abilities do have a significant impact as well. <P>I do think an enhancement to taunt would be appropriate, however. This should be something a warrior shines in, and while other tank classes have alternate means to lay on the charm, a warrior must rely in great part on equipment. Either a boost to the warrior's taunt factor, or a new skill gained at high level that is inherently better would be a good addition.<P>2) Attributes: I love the idea that our strength/agility/etc. would actually mean something, and that each race would have their emphasis. For example, an Ogre warrior should always be stronger by far than a Gnome warrior, and this should be clear in battle. Conversely, that Gnome warrior should be faster and much harder to hit than the lumbering ogre counterpart. I don't really see this as a change Verant is likely to make at this time, but I hope they take the concept of diversity to heart for EQ II. A 'simple' suggestion would be to give significant damage bonuses, as well as defensive bonuses based on size and toughness to the bigguns, while adding an inherent (increasing) haste bonus and defensive bonuses based on quickness. I say 'simple' in terms of concept...putting that in and overall balance issues might not be so simple  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>3) Binding/Travel: I don't feel like warriors need the ability to bind. Additional bind points have already been brought up as a general issue, and I think that would be a good move to help make some areas more desirable to fight in. As Remf mentioned back in the original thread, I do have to wonder why the Locket of Escape was removed...I don't think it could cause any problems (and certainly was a rare item). I think this was a truly rewarding item for melee types.<P>General travel is an interesting 'problem'. Here's a different perspective, taking Dreadlands as the example. This is a large zone that sees constant traffic; the worst obstacle(s) are the many green mobs (to 50+) that wander throughout. The warrior is the only class that does not possess some natural means of traversing that area safely (or at least getting away with relative ease. Most casters can become invisible, and all will have some means to root/snare/mes/stun an annoying greenie who latches onto their tail. A ranger can invis/snare, a paladin can root/park, a shadowknight can invis/snare/feign, a monk can feign and a rogue can hide/sneak. The warrior must rely on one of those others to facilitate travel, or equipment (jboots being the best example) and they are the only class that falls in this situation. <P>As has been mentioned (Remf covered it specifically in terms of the greenie horde, and others mentioned related ideas), I would propose an inherent 'respect' effect. Green mobs (with perhaps specific exceptions due to location, etc) would not automatically agro on the passing warrior. I haven't thought this one all the way through, but I really cannot see anything truly unbalancing about this. There are probably other options for this as well (quests for items that would help, etc).<P>4) Equipment: I think most people agree that the cobalt bracer/helm drop rates are very low. To get more detailed, the Myconid drops in Sebilis (from whom the bracer is obtained) seem completely wacky...gems that drop off level 10-20 mobs seem fairly common, and fine steel weapons seem out of place as well. Please examine this.<P>It's been mentioned a few times, but I have to agree with the idea that the Cobalt gauntlet's effect is just useless. No one will use it over the boot's effect; if it at least stacked with Strength of the Kunzar, it might be considered 'usable'. Can this be looked at?<P>Back-slot wearable shields is a great idea, imho...perhaps this could be generally implemented only for specific classes, and would be one way to deal with pleas for more AC.<P>The Epic Weapon drops, specifically Maestro's hand, the Spiroc blade and the Queen's blade, seem to be the biggest frustration with the quest itself. I'd like to see these re-examined; seeing 9+ Maestro's fail to drop a single hand (as I've read on various boards) seems overly rare. <P>5) HP and AC: I think the biggest question remains whether or not there is a soft AC cap at 1100. I do think the nature of the warrior should involve the potential to have the most AC and significantly more HP than any other class. The best way to approach this (if Verant agrees), I'm not sure of. Perhaps back-slot wearable shields would be a good answer for AC (and could potentially address defensive issues for other classes, such as Paladin and SK). Perhaps inherent class bonuses. With regards to HP, I'd probably say simply, take a look at a maxed out warrior (equipment and level) and compare with similarly maxed out examples of other classes. If a warrior's HP should be significantly higher than the others, make any changes appropriate to make that so.<P>That's all for now...Mongo go bash da phone company peepuls now...grrrrrr....<P>Mongo Baroogar<BR>53 warrior, Karana<BR>Mongo #5!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As a Warrior on the Rathe Server, I have come to believe that we as a class are fairly balanced. Most of our problems deal with things that are broken or drops that are insane to get. For those of you that play warriors, you know as you past level 50 that anything we do has to be with the mind that we need our gear and weapons. No way can we do the job that we are supposed to do if we can not tank the mobs. My complaints are not the with what I want, just to fix what we have. We ready don't need new skills or items in the game, nor do we need to beg for aoe taunts. We need to address the problems warriors have with what is already there for us and when those are fixed then maybe look at a couple things to help us out.<P>1-Taunt-Totally usless skill when we are post 50. We might get the mob to hit us if we stand there and beg it, but if a ranger, sk, or rogue are hitting the critters its dang near impossible to get it off them. And don't let a caster rail the mob with high hp damage, it is gonna take him down 90 percent of the time. We as warriors shoud have the ability to deal higher damage when the mobs turn their backs to us. But we hit the same amount of damage if we are facing them. Make it so that if a mob turns his back to us warriors, we start hitting for dbl the amount we normally do. We talk about being as close to reality as possible, well if you turn your back on someone you are fighting, guess what you dont last at all. This would in one easy way bring our taunt up so the mobs will stay on us warriors like they are suppose to.<P>2-Disarm-In all the time I have fought on EQ and brought this skill up, I find that it is worse than taunt at post 50 levels. This is suppose to be a warriors one skill to help a group out. I have noticed that when I do manage to knock the weapon from some mobs hands, he doesn't drop much in his damage output. Code error, or just too hard to say ah guys we can't fix this type of thing. Yes mobs with weapons hit hard but when we do disarm them they should not hit for the same amount of damage. This skill also needs to be looked at.<P>3-Cobalt Armor-Well what can we say about this. The drops are totally to sparse. We fight for hrs and never see a drop in our armor, come on Verant please give us a break. You put this in the game for us and we fight to get it and well its just not there. And then when it does drop 50 percent of the time it is rolled on and casters take for their twinkie warriors. And its equally hard to see cobalt on someones twink that is level 20 to 30 and we are 50 or better. Jealousy or or greed you say, nope I think its not fair that the one thing we as warriors work so hard for are unable to recieve these items when they do drop. Jesus a uber guild has the twinks twinks in cobalt when they drop. A fast a quick solution to making sure the hard working warrior get there cobalt is to make it no drop. In this alone you will make it so warriors get the items that is there. Its not right to see it go to a twink when its one of the best things Verant has made for us.<P>4-AC & HP-For warriors to be the main tanks and to see rogues and monks come within a few points of AC and HP or even better than us, is not my idea of balance. We as warriors should have the best AC and HP in the game bar none. Any where you look a skilled warrior is always the best there is for taking damage as well as having the HP to stay in the fight while taking the hits. This area really needs to be looked into and some ajustments made.<P>5-Items-Some of the better items in the game, other than cobalt, has wis or int on it and you can bet your bottom dollar the we as warriors are the last on the list for it. Oh we can't even roll if it has these stats on it. This is one time I will agree to making the Fear shield a Back slot item or making it worth our while to carry it. As it stands now we really lack in items for our class. One thing I might suggest it that as you progress in the game and your skills max out you should look at the warriors having the ability to using a 2 hand weapon as a one had weapon at higher levels. We have grown in strength and knowledge and this is one area that we are lacking in. Larger races should be able to take a 2 hand sword and use it as one hand with a shield. This would really make the warriors be true warriors as they should be.<P>6-Crits and Crips-Where are they as we get higher in levels. They get fewer and fewer. Most fights I go without seeing single one. This needs to be looked into. We as warriors should see nice critical and some decent cripples not the same as when we are fighting but dbl to trible the normal amount.<P>7-Epic Weapon and Quest-Ok where and who were the folks that dreamed up this for us warriors? We have to go to all three planes, Chardock, and fight 2 freaking dragons. And whats the story line behind this. We are to prove ourselves worthy to have them, not to be in a uber guild to recieve these weapons. Lets break down the epic its starts in Freeport simple enough, but within a few steps we are at Permafrost and sit and wait for the heart to drop, ok not bad. When we finally get that we have to then ah say we fight 2 dragons that are camped the second they spawn. Red and Green Scale here. It should have been if you are under 53 the red scale and over 53 the green scale. But when we get this quest we as warriors know we are totally screwed, Nags for those under 53 is hard to get because its a rare spawn and 75 percent of the time he will have a scale, but come on, Severilous in EJ also, this is nuts. Why both scales? Well, when we have these we think oh wow, now we have the Scabbard, think again. We are off to the planes, not one, but two, and both of the mobs 80 to 90 percent of the time do not drop the item we need. Jesus Christ on a stick camping the planes and fights between guilds. Talk about one thing we do not need. The folks who dreamed this up for us warriors had a weird sense of humor. Ok, lets get back on track here. We go to Hate for Maestro's hand, and guess what it doesn't drop not one kill but 9 out of 10 it will not drop. Lots of hard feelings and hurt go with our epic. Try Spiroc in Sky, good lord have we done enough yet. Well we have everything for the Scabbard and we get it, but wait, we now have a item to hold and takes up a slot in our inventory and its worthless. It needs to have something done to it. Come on lets look at this, it should have some stats to it like 25 to 30 ac, 100 hp 10 to each stat and be able to worn on the back, why you ask because look at what we went thru just to get this item. And its useless. On to the hilts and the blades. Hilts are found easy but now we have a point that we look all over for things again, nothing to major except we have to go back to the planes, this time to Fear and try for the Golem Clay ball. This one isn't on Crazic, thank god. So the hilts are done, now to the blades. Only thing here is you should never have made it so we need player made items for our quest. The second you put in rebreathers you jumped the price up on them for us warriors and dang near ripped us off of our hard earned plat. Warriors are not rich period. Most times we barely have 1k plat in the bank. Anyway thats one blade, the second and final one drops off the Queen in Chardock. Can we say back to the block again. Uber mob, uber rare and folks are not up to fighting the Queen 4 to 8 times to get one blade per warrior. This is and has been insane from the beginning. But now we have all our items to finally get the EPIC. The weapon to define us as the Warrior. OOPS. Not happening. They have let us down again. These weapons are ok but they are not on par with the other epics in the game. They really need to be looked at. Damage to speed and the effect are just not up to par and the stats should increase for us to truely define that we are master WARRIORS that have achieved the weapon that shows ours skills and knowledge of being that warrior.<P>Thank you for your time and I do hope that these areas are looked into. They are to me the most important in the game and with them warriors would be as Verant has stated the perfect balance in the game.<P>Terq Windjammer<BR>Rathe Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I think a lot of the warriors posting should remember the purpose of this thread...that being to try to balance our class with others.  That being said, here are some thoughts:<P>Kunark Armor<BR>- No other class has basically the "same" effect on two pieces of armor (that being gloves and boots).  Give the gloves a different effect which is distinctive like the other classes.<BR>- Cobalt BP effect should have the same casting time as other classes (agan consistency!)<BR>- Drop rates for bracers and helms are a bit too low.  I dont know of ANY class which has a more difficult time in getting those pieces.  Let's make it somewhat more equal.  <P>Plane of Growth <BR>- BP is the only piece with an effect.  How about being consistent with other classes and making another piece with an effect.  I like the idea of putting invis on the legs which someone else suggested before.<P>Warrior Epic<BR>- 100% drop on the Queen in Chardok.  Again, consistency with other classes epic items = balance  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>- Give the weapons inherent haste like the other melee epic weapons (again NOT consistent)<BR>- Make the weapons class defining, give us AC on them or make it proc more with higher taunt value<BR>- Make the red scabbard a useable item...perhaps a waist AC item with haste<P>Skills<BR>- Raise the cap on Taunt.  In most situations I can not out taunt a monk, ranger or rogue and I wield dual jade maces with PoA haste  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><BR>- Make disarm useful. Currently the only good use is in PvP.  An idea is to deequip the weapon vs. dropping it.  This would make it useful for those mobs which drop "named" weapons (e.g. Lamentation)<BR>- Raise bind wound cap at higher levels.  250 at level 60 is reasonable.<P>HP/AC<BR>Contrary to what most people think, Paladins and SK's are very close to warriors in terms of AC and HP.  Due to the rarity of cobalt, a lot of Paladins and SK's have equal or in some cases higher AC.  A lot of monks also have almost the same or higher AC than I do <BR>- HP and AC is what defines the warrior class.  Increase HP by a moderate 5-10% (perhaps a bonus at levels 55 and 60)<BR>- DO NOT increase AC of our gear but rather give warriors an AC bonus at level 55 and 60 which totals between 5-10%<P>Disciplines<BR>- Disciplines which are shared amongst other classes (e.g. riposte) should have the same duration and reuse time (again consistency!)<P>Critical Hits/Crippling Blows<BR>- Minimum damage for critical hits should be x2 maximum damage.  Average damage currently is less than 1x maximum damage<BR>- Minimum damage for crippling blows should also be x2 or perhaps x2.5 maximum damage<BR>- Increase the rate of crits and crips.  Currently these hits are a small blip in our current melee damage.  A suggestion to increase this by 10-15% at least (more if the minimum damage will not be increased)<P>Something also to consider for all the non warriors is the fact that we pay a hefty price for the VERY few advantages we currently have. We can not solo, are EXTREMELY group dependant and have NO ability to escape if things go wrong.  To top it off, without equipment, we are NOTHING and completely useless.<P>Ktang Ironforge<BR>Warlord - Scions of Phoenix<BR>Ayonae Ro<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Gawd, I wish I could edit posts...<P><BR>- In Attributes, that should say the increasing haste bonus, defense bonus due to quickness would be for smaller races (obvious, but just correcting for completeness). <P>- Mongo use da werd 'inherent' too much.<P>- Forgot to mention Disarm again...more a general issue for several classes, but the skill is completely useless in Kunark and Velious. It's mostly useless in the original  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>- Something new to do 35ish-50ish...there is nothing new for the class in that range (and arguably going back to pre-level 25, as riposte is a passive skill). <P>- Crits/Crips and general Berserkishness: Eye-candy, nothing that can be relied on in battle. <P>Gotta run!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The only two problems I see with warriors are:<P>Taunt - Someone always has a bigger damage spell or a more aggro spell than the damage a warrior can do. End result is the warrior chasing a mob around trying to beat it off every group member one by one. Taunt just does not work in this case.<P>Bind - When you have to bind in a city and run three or four zones to get to a dungeon and then enter that dungeon for a raid. After the night is over people leave randomly through the night and low and behold you are stuck running back to the city. What a major waste of time.<P>Proposed Solutions:<P>Taunt ability - Once every 4hrs game time, have a button that refreshes with an area effect taunt that keeps the mobs aggro'd for 15 secs on the warrior that used the ability. Make this overwrite the hate list until expired.<P>Take Me Home ability - Once every two days game time, have a button that refreshes that allows a warrior to use that takes them back to thier bind point. You can make this a long delay cast so that it can not be called an evac and it should be self only and not usable while melee'ing.<P><BR>I feel that these two items would make the warriors a much better addition to the group and also a more enjoyable character to play. Nothing worse than spending 20 minutes running to the raid and 20 minutes running back home at the end of the night. I want play time, not spend a quarter of the night traversing the landscape. And what is a tank if they can not keeps the mobs off the other group members. <P>Hope This Helps<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>couple extra thoughts from tonight. <P>And Absor, I'll second the person who said chin up. you got a tough job for sure.<P>I hit 44 last night at the Orc fort in EW.  Was grouped most of that time with a 41 rogue and 41 SK. I must say it's rediculous that being 2 to 3 levels higher than those 2 was so difficult to taunt off them. There was also a Ranger who was 40 or 41 as well.  <P>At the end of the night I asked the Rogue what he used, he responded a Slime Coated Harpoon and Burning Rapier.  I have been trying different combinations of weapons to find the most effective.  Now, keep in mind I'm a 44 Dwarf Warrior main, no other character above 14. I have a couple items thanks to the assistance of my Guild, otherwise I had to come up with cash or trade or loot for what I have.<P>I use either a WurmSlayer/Crystilline Short Sword (12 24 adn some bonuses) or the CSS/Cane of the Tranquil (11 25).  I have been using the 2nd combo the last 2 days, as that is when I picked up the CSS, for times when I need taunt the most. I just happened to win 2 nights ago, a Spine Chill Spear, 10 28 with a small 38dd ice proc. I had intended to just give this to my baby shaman or fun.  But now I can't.<P>Why?  By 44, the yard trash around the Orc Fort is either low blue or green. I pulled one last night, either via a single hit or getting really close.  The Rogue and I went to town on it. I was using my CSS/CotT combo.  The Mob turned to face me twice! nothing I could do could get him to taunt off the Rogue.  So, just for giggles, I put the SCS up as my main (it's prim only) and the CSS offhand.  For the next 3 minutes before I logged, I had no real problems taunting off the rogue.<P>Now think about that. A combo with a 12/24 in the primary and 11/25 in offhand was OUT taunted by a combo with 10/28 piercing (which I only have at about 170 or 180) and a sometimes proc and 12/24 offhand.  It would seem that little almost useless proc, which I as a Dwarf can get to go off quite a bit, was giving me the edge I needed to taunt off a Rogue 3 LEVELS under me. That's BS! There should be NO WAY on Vesshan's Frozen Tundra for that Rogue to out taunt me. Why have me in the group if I have that much trouble taunting off a mob of someone 3 lvls under me?<P>And it's just as bad with casters.  Absor, I hope you see this message, and you'll go back to the first post I made in this thread, on the first page about the 4th or th post, the one with the Outline to start it off. Reread my ideas for improving out Taunt.  I still like either b) or d) the best, but what is very appearent is someone needs to fix the amount of taunting both the skill and a warriors weapon does.  And it needs to scale much much more by level.<P>As many of my fellow Warriors have stated, as any mob in Norrath, who are you going to fear the most? The little sneaky rogue, the silken wearing Monk, or the battle scarred, plate wearing, massive weapon weilding, crazy warrior sob?  It should take ANY class at least 2 lvls above a Warrior to taunt off a Warrior in melee, and casters only if they Nuke too soon in a fight.  Extra mobs that haven't been engaged, well of course they would go after the Nuker or Cleric, seeing as my Bad Self isn't knocking their brains in, but this issue of a pip sqeak 41 Rogue or SK or Ranger out taunting me is absolutely disturbing.<P>This MUST be changed. Everything else is gravy for now, but this one thing MUST be fixed.  Of course there has to be ways for a Rogue or Hybrid to Caster to pull off of us, like we don't use the Taunt skill for 3 or 4 or 5 rounds, THEN we drop down the hate list. Or I stop swinging for 3 rounds, etc. <P>I hope this is something you and the others there are Verant can work on. I also hope you consider a few of the other ideas floated here as well, but by for now, this is long enough for this single issue =)<BR> <BR>I hope you have a good time in Baltimore this weekend, I would have loved to drop by but I lost my job 2 months ago, and could in no way even think about dropping 2 $85 registrations for the wife and me.  Just remember, Bring a Big Coat! Its usually very cold around these parts in February =) A hat wouldn't hurt either =)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I will be brief with this.<P>I think we need a minimum damage on our Critical strikes.  I average slash around 80 and then get an area announcement that I land a Critical for 25 points of damage.<P><BR>Ooh Yeah I caught him right in the Shield on that one.  He was not expecting that hehe!<P>Sorry if this is repeat but I do not get paid to sort through all the whining to find the realissues.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
