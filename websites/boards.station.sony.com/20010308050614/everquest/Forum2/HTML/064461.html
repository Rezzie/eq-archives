</FONT><HR>I have noticed the posts on this board have changed from ideas of ways to improve EQ to a mass exiting of players quitting.<P>I too have experienced this first hand. Our guild leader (LVL 60 Player with two years playing time) quit EQ saturday. He is canceling his account and deleting characters. Our guild is extremely saddend by this and many other players are thinking of quitting as well.<P>I know many of you are leaving due to burn out and interests in new games like shadowbane.com or starwars.<P>However, please keep in mind that EQ is what you make of it and if things dont seem right instead of quitting and just giving up use this board to communicate to Verant what changes will make you stay..<P>I would sure hate to lose more friends like the one I lost this weekend..<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One of our guildmates left EQ.  He didn't post it here; he just cancelled his account and took up other pursuits.<P>Verant isn't very interested in what the players say, apparently.  So telling them what will make you stay isn't going to work well.  God knows I've done boxcar loads of /bugs, /feedbacks, /petitions, and posts on simple, obnoxious little bugs ... that are still here after 22 months.  My guildmate just got tired of what he perceived as arrogance and indifference, so he left.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>well, do not believe what you read on the boards too much. At least half of the so called quitters here have not left the game, and to avoid embarrassment just change their chat handle.<P>I would guess that the number of folks the enter/leave EQ is pretty flat, with a much larger number entering the game at any given time (notice the server pops just grow?).<P>What is happening of late though, is that a small percentage of the folks that have achieved the highest of levels are completely burned out. They have played 12 hours a day almost everyday for the past 2 years now, their guild makes huge demands of them and they now have a convienient excuse to get out. The problem is that this is a very vocal crowd, hence all the messages you see.<P>Another part of the problem is that one or two "famous" (although I never heard of them) players supposedly just quit as well. This is no big deal either, except there are a subset of players that idolize these toons because they were so powerful, all knowing, etc. That idolization is misplaced it seems, because if these "famous" folks were still the pioneers that they used to be, they would still be up to the challenge, that is the problem with idolizing a toon, it is just a normal person behind the character, nobody truly worth looking up to.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You can hardly call current quiting number massive.  It is just because AO, Dark Age Comelot and Shadowbane are in Beta now.  Lots of those Beta testers are also EQ players.  So, they spent less and less time to play EQ.  Since EQ characters/items/pp worth next to nothing on Ebay now days, they will just quit and delete their characters.  Wait until all 3 games and UO2 comes out, then you will see what massive quiting really is.  Back when EQ released, more than half of UO players left UO. The only reason that UO didn't really lose all the subscribtion is due to the fact, OSI allows player to sell their accounts.  So the otherwise lost subscribtions didn't get lost completly.  This however wouldn't be true for EQ.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I left for several reasons.<P>First and formost is Verant's so called Customer Service.<P>In addition to the Mystere bannings and a few others their phone service just plains sucks as does their billing dept.  I've recently quit EQ and since then my credit card has been billed a total of 5 times in the past 2 months. EVERY TIME I CALL their phone line I get the blah blah blah look at the website message then it transfers you to their help line. Once I get to that I get the message "we are experiencing heavy call volume, please call again later."<P>I'm like W T F??? Every major company I've dealt with, including the one I work for has a call routing system set up that puts people on hold until the next available operator can answer. They don't tell people to call back later. That is just REALLY REALLY BAD Customer Service.<P>Another reason I've left is the attitude of the Dev Team. Arrogance Arrogance Arrogance. Oh..did I say Arrogance? Just all the nerfs recently is enough to go on that I'm not going to really say too much on it.<P>Bah..screw this. I really don't care too much about this game anymore so I'm just going to stop here. It was fun for a while and that's about it. Verant as a company just plain sucks and I definatly won't be buying any product put out by them. Sorry Raph, that means no SW:G for me. <P>p.s. Bloodsage, you're a troll..just admit it when you can pull your lips away from Verant's collective arses.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I tend to disagree with some of the issues here.<P>I too am quite burned out with this game. I play a 50 Wizard, 35 Warrior, 21 Cleric, 18 monk.<P>The reason I can understand folks leaving is that if you do not belong to a large or uber guild, the end game is basically gone. <P>A good example is my 50 Wizard. What is the motivation for me to go higher? Better equipment? Spells? Adventure?<P>Well - I am a casual player. I hold a 9-5 day job and have a family. The time that I have invested into this game I feel has been all to nothing. Right now, I have never been to a plane, never killed a dragon. My guild is too small to tackle these things and after trying to get into a larger guild for 3 months with nothing to show for it, I basically only log on my Wizard to Tp folks around the zones. Is that fun? Heck no. But at this point - what else do I have to look forward to? Not a thing. Just log to say hi to friends, maybe gate and help some newbies out. That's it.<P>Since most of the high end areas to play are based upon large multiple groups to adventure, the time and coordination to pull something like this together is far to great for me unless I want to quit my job, get a divorce, and neglect every family member I have.<P>Verant has made it exceedingly clear that they are gearing the game to Uber and large guilds to provide content for them, and in the mean time feel that if the UBERs are happy, the challenge and adventure is there for my player demograhpic as well. They are trying to make the average player play the game how THEY want us to play it.<P>Unfortunately, this is not the case for most subscribers. The launch of Velious makes that point painstakingly clear. I should have never bought it in the first place. My Wizard is useless there and the rest of my chars and having a hard time even trying to tackle the easy potions of that continent.<P>So - as far as people leaving, please understand it may not be because they hate the game. It is just after a while, there is nothing left to do within their means. The gap is so wide between the UBERs and "normal" players, that eventually it is only the UBERs that will remain and new subscribers that see that game and want to try it.<P>For me - the only thing left to play for is fun. Start new chars with my friends and Plevel to 50 only to retire and start a new one again. End game is not a possibility for me. The only thing I can do is play to be happy and not worry about getting to 60 and be uber twinked with the best equipment and go to Veeshan's Peak. All of these scenarios are far from my grasp. Either that or quit, unsubscribe and decide that I do have a life.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If you are a casual gamer who finds yourself constantly frustrated by not being able to accomplish anything in a short time in EQ, I would strongly recommend you look into other multiplayer games on the market...even now. Microsoft has one named Asheron's Call. It is incredibly cheap to try, and it does some things worse and some things better than EQ. For instance, you can log in for 30 mins-1hr and actually accomplish something, and have fun doing it. I am not leaving EQ, but sometimes I just can't take the time-sink aspect of it. It makes no sense to limit yourself to EQ when there are alternatives out there. And soon, there will be many alternatives.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I haven't noticed many people leave the game, in fact it seems like the server sizes keep growing.  In fact Morell-Thule, the server I play on, now has over 2,000 people on it which is the most ever.  Yes, we might see the numbers drop when the new games come out; but remember your characters stay active for 3 months which gives people time to test the game and come back if they want to.  A lot of these games aren't all they are cracked up to be and are just a lot of hype.  Remember the supposed EQ killer Asheron's Call?  Until these game are actually out and playable, I'm not going to say I'm going anywhere.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
