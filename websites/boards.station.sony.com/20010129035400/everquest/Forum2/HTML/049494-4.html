</FONT><HR>I posted in the first thread, but there's a point I feel needs to be made, so I'll post again.<P>I keep seeing the words 'roleplaying' used as a means to justify upgrades to existing abilities and new abilities altogether.<P>Now don't get me wrong - I'm a roleplayer and have been for 25 years now.  I've worked in the RPG industry and been heavily involved in scenario and character design for tournaments.  As such, I've seen many a player try to justify things that are massively unbalancing in the name of roleplaying.<P>One of the things that bothers me is the idea of a non-aggro charm animals spell.  Yes, it makes plenty of sense to be able to 'befriend animal,' but, in my opinion, this would be horribly unbalancing.  Where's the risk versus reward?  No risk charms of NPC Mobs (which are far more powerful than pet NPCs) is just a free damage dealer/meat shield pet for a class that already has no problem soloing.  If a charm animal breaks now, druids can easily run away with sow and snare it, so even tho' it's not 'a proper roleplaying scenario,' there isn't that much of a risk involved.<P>Compare this to enchanters who don't have the sow to escape when the charm (their only means of soloing) breaks.<P>Roleplaying is all well and good and the basis of any well written class, but game balance has to be taken into consideration as well.  For example, a well known and classic 'trick' of mind controlling (charming)magic is to cause the victim to fall on his sword and kill himself.<P>But if you gave enchanters a /pet suicide command, it would be far too unbalancing.  Perfectly within roleplaying parameters and in line with the type of spell, but not balancing.<P>Since the issue at hand is balancing druids, try to keep that in mind when making any changes to this or any class.<P>My .02<P>SG</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I would ask that if you do anything for Druids in terms of healing that it be move Superior Heal to 49. Anything more mana efficient than Superior Heal would seriously diminish the usefulness of the cleric class, which is one dimensional. Not only would moving the spell to 49 give it to them earlier, but it would reduce the fizzle rate post 50 as well.<P>--Bremmin Ironsoul<BR>Lv 52 Vicar of Brell</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Please please please Absor DO NOT make quad-kiting harder, for some it's easy just because they are good at it, I'm not so I don't do it, but I'd at least like to try it once someday, and if you reduce the range of AOE spells, what good will they be? That would be as foolish as the Adantite Staff for Monks that procs an AOE spell, the Monk is standing right inside the AOE and gets hurt too. This is just foolish.<BR>Personally I'm happy with the way my druid is right now. When I started playing my Druid, I didn't expect to heal as good as a cleric, because well....I was playing a druid, not a cleric.<BR>If I want to be better at melee, I'll play a melee class, if I want to be better at healing, I'll play a cleric. I like the druid class as-is, because I can do a little bit of everything, just good enough to keep me alive, and just bad enough so that millions of people aren't crying for you to nerf the druid class.<BR>Please reconsider the BAD idea of reducing the range of AOE spells, it sucks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor reducing the range on AoE spells would be a mistake for certain classes. I could care less about quad kiting cause I enjoy the company of others. But consider this from a wizard stand point.<P>1) Not many people will even let a wiz/mag/druid/sham to use AoE spells in a group.<BR>Most are afraid of the idea especially when a chanter is in the group.<P>2) When I finally can get in an AoE group (only 2 times now in my 51 Wizard career) I get the best adrenaline rush ever, and so does the rest of the group. Isnt that what this is about, group play?<P>3) reduce the range on AoE PB spells will kill item #2.<P>Sorry to intrude on a druid thread, but I think AoE rocks, and would be a shame to see it reduced from what it is. Especially since rains aren't up to par (meaning it hits the pets), Al'Kabor just plain is a joke, and Pillars have a fairly short raidius anyway.<P>For those that Quad Kite. Let em. they are the ones missing out on group interaction. And if they dont know correct tactics in a group, then they will be learning thier lesson the hard way.<BR>If not even the group kicking them out for killing them.<P>I only read page 3 and Absor's reply so please forgive me if someone already brought something to this affect up.

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Thank you at looking at our high end of the game and how The Druid class become fairly obsolete at this stage of the game.  I believe your ideas are fair and do not in any way invalidate the Cleric class.<P>What you have given me is hope.  Hope that my soon to be 60 Druid (Grouping Druid that is....) will not be retired and will once again be a great addition to a group once again.  1-50 we were perceived as "cool dudes".  Power was thought to be the ability to solo.  Post 50, true power comes in the form of what you offer to a group.<P>In no way do we wish to "kick" the Cleric out.  Rez and Complete heal assure the Cleric a spot in any group.  These high-end healing upgrade ideas of yours assure the Druid class a future.  I know with your ideas for change/help, I will not retire the class that I love so much.<P>thank you Absor,<P>-- F</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>/amaze<P>Wow!  By all means, yes, proposal accepted.  With Superior Heal at 49, and Remedy at 55, druids will make great backup healers, and passable primary healers in groups that cooperate.  Shamans should definitely get similar upgrades - this would solve the nearly absolute dependence on clerics for very high level groups, without putting them out of a job when they show up.<P>What about damage shields?  As stated a few times, currently their damage is uncredited.  Casting a damage shield on a character that is on a mob's agro list will add the caster to the mob's agro list.  The damage does not raise agro for the tank or the caster after that, and I think it works fine that way.  I absolutely DON'T want credit for the damage done by the damage shield, druids have a hard enough time staying low on the agro list with snares, debuffing spells and heals.  Giving "agro-credit" to the target could work, but I think this would work more in favor of people working on twinks, as opposed to even-level groups, and is not worth the effort.<P>From 1-50, fighting in the old world, fighting blue cons in a group with a tank, damage shields can often kick back about 20-35% of the damage dealt by the monster.  They're great spells there.  They're a good addition to a druid's oft-lamented indoor-grouping arsenal.  To be honest, we do just fine in dungeons.  In Kunark, and Velious, this line loses some effectiveness as the mobs hit a LOT harder.  This ends up diminishing a druid's contribution to a high-level group.  When powerlevelling newbies, damage shields kick back easily 50-100% of the damage dealt by the monster.  How about damage shields based on the armor class or level of the target?<P>I'd trade the ability to 'PL a toon to 10th level in 45 minutes' for a slight boost to the damage output in high level groups in a heartbeat.  Just a thought.<P>Thanks again!<P>-Quelm, 48th season druid<BR>Drunken Tsunami, Terris-Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Just something of a different texture that can be applied, instead of looking like a level 5 at level 35.

</FONT><HR>I'm less than 4 bubs from level 34 with my Druid and despite my feeling that I would rather everyone else also have to work as hard as I worked to get to where I am I will still tell you the EXP penalty for Druids is still too much!  <P>Even with all your dungeon Xp boosts.  Even if it's easier to get groups because the burden is not shared.  The real fix would have been partly what you already did on the XP system tweak but ALSO to cut back on just how hard you are trimming the Xp per kill for the Druids themselves.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I have read most of these posts about what druids need want etc with varying degrees of incredulity. First of all, I actually play a druid. Almost got to level 52 before the lack of available groups forced me to solo all the time or retire him. So hes retired and I started a monk.<P>I started a druid for the versatility, for the ability to solo when i couldnt get a group, for being second or thrid best in a lot of categories.<BR>And for the the first 40 levels or soo, the class lives up to its billing.<P>However, starting in the low to mid 40's groupage becomes more and more difficult because we cant keep up with heals, even in a secondary role.<P>The real problem here isnt really what druids want or need, but that the whold game is broken post 50. The only classes that have enough value to get consistent groups (as has been said before) are warriors, clerics, enchanters, and rogues. This is what needs to get fixed, the post 50 game for everyone else.<P>However, all it takes for druids to be helpful in the post 50 groups is the additional healing that we should expect. Make us continue as the second best healers in the game (along with shaman) and most of us will be quite happy.<P>The real question is how much healing power SHOULD we have as second best? The best indicator of that would be to compare other classes. For example the 2nd best dd class (mage) does for 60-80% of the damage that the best dd class (wizards) do throughout the game. You could make the same argument with melee types. Second best usally has a similar percantge of hps/ac when caompared to the best tank (warrior). Look at damage dealing, Rogues are unquestionalby number one, but monks and warriors arent THAT far behind.<P>Lets accept, for arguments sake, that the 2nd best class should be approx 2/3 of the best class for a specific skill, attribute, or whatever you want to call it. I think this is true for most things now, with one exception. HEALING!<P>The best heal spell for the 2nd best class is a 583 hp heal with an insane fizzle rate. The best cleric spell is a 10,000 pt heal (4,000 is probably a better number to judge it with however, since it doesnt always heal more than this.) This means the 2nd best heal in the game is aprroximately 15% as effective as the best heal with an insane fizzle rate. No other skill, attribute whatever has near this disparity bewteen first and second.<P>My suggestion? Level 44 superior healing for druids and shamen with normal fizzle rates. Extra spells for healing for both of those classes at 54 and 59 that heal (in whatever form) 1250 and 2k, repectively. This is still a 50% difference even at 59. This means it will take at least 2 characters even at 59 to match a cleric's healing power and 3 or 4 prior to 59. This will not make clerics less wanted in groups. Clerics still have lots of usefulness in a group. Mabbe they will actually be able to have mana available for buffs, etc once in a while if some of the secondary healers can actually take some of the mana load from them.<P>I'm sure a lot of clerics won't like it now .. but after time will come to realize that it helps them as much as it helps us ...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Damage shield damage credited to the caster?  Fragile snares?  Are you completely insane?<P>That's all I need, put a DS on someone, let it<BR>build up a little MORE aggro on me.  Oh yes, thank you sir, may I have another?<P>I DS all the meleers in my party for TWO reasons.  The first reason is to get some free damage in on the mob, the SECOND is to help keep them high on the hate list where they belong so I don't get munched when I heal.<P>And making snare fragile?  I know I saw some people mentioning that... again, are you INSANE?  That's got to be the single most horrible nerf imaginable.  Not only will it completely screw druids (AND wizzies, btw, with bonds of force) but it will screw everyone else who ever groups with us.  One of the *primary* jobs is to control the runners, and snare is just the thing for that.  You take that away and make it fragile and people will rip your heads off.  You make snares fragile, you better make the darkness series of spells (necro and SK) fragile also, and then you've equalized it out and screwed EVERYONE.<P>So, by making snares fragile we've now elimanted druid kiting... oh yes.  That nasty druid kiting.  We've also eliminated wizzie kiting.  We've also eliminated fear kiting.  We've also made it nearly impossible to control runners (whack it, watch the snare drop and it bounds off into the distance).  So, to control runners, get a 'chanter.  I mean, they already have all the crowd control stuff, so let's just make it even MORE necessary to have one in a group and who in their right minds will want a druid at all when his DS's aggro the mob on him forcing the clerics to mana dump and his snares are broken constantly.<P>Gahhhh... the mind boggles at the concept.  I pray to tunare that nobody is insane enough to take that recommendation seriously.<P>-- Ganelon Wolfwalker<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>WOOT! an end to fizzles across the board =D<P>Thank you for the heal ideas. Remedy would be perfect-it doesnt take long for a caster to die when getting hit and even gheal is usually too slow.<P>Charm- please dont take away the ability to give the pet commands. Even enchanters are able to do this for their charmed pets and likely changing the mechanics for one would bug the other. Besides that commands are useful. I dont mind a little risk when pet charming, thats what snare, root, and fear are for.<P>Heheh treant form would be cool =D I always loved the creaking sounds they make.<P>Damage sheilds. If a puller has built up no agro I have noticed a minor agro on them. Usually not enough to get you in trouble, though we are all familiar with being frenzied on out of the blue. There is no way we would survive the agro between a thorn sheild and our dots if both we accounted back to us. We simply dont have the hps or AC. Remember, mobs +50 summon and taunt doesnt work so well plus 50 either.<P>Vermic is heavy, and the stats are wierd. *5int* on the gloves!?!?

</FONT><HR>Ok , posting as a level 60 druid here.<P><BR>There is a problem with druids. They aren't really wanted in groups, and aren't really wanted on raids except for porting. Argue all you want, look at the evidence. <P>I don't know why people hate druids or immediately pretend that there isn't a problem.<P>Forget animal charms, there arent enough animals in the game to bother increasing any abilities here. If you increase our abilities here it says you know its because its useless anyway.<P>I didn't want to primarily solo to level 60, I was basically forced.<P>Basically I DO think upgrades to healing are a good idea. It's either that or give us a lure. Druids need a fast casting heal. It's that simple. The fizzle rate on sup heal and the casting time is clearly a problem. At high level. I didn't specialise in Alteration for nothing.<P>Don't change damage shields. At all. They aren't that good. <P>I'm very wary of changes to quad kiting. I never did it myself, but the whole point of an AE spell is to do AE damage. There's nothing you can really do except make another spell useless. Druids already have enough useless spells. Other classes have AE spells too, magicians and wizards. Wizards can quad kite as well don't forget. Bonuses have been made to grouping, wait to see how those changes go before attacking this. <P>For the people below level 50, please try to stay out of this. When I was level 49 I had no complaints either. Hitting 49 and getting all those new spells is great, there's no problem at 49. You can hit nagafen with ice ? Great for you. In a few levels you wont be able to hit any uber mobs at all. It's the 50+ game that's broken for druids.<P>Protection of the glades is a fantasic spell , and natureskin was great too. The hp/ac buffs are fine. <P>I am lucky enough to have ro's firey sundering. It's a great spell too but was very hard to get. Kudos there.<P>Yes we need either a faster casting/more reliable heal or a lure. To remain productive in the higher aspects of he game. It's simply true. No more flim flam. Unless you want to give us something new that's really good like shaman slows. Damage shield are not as good as shaman slows. I think that's where it all went wrong.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

While it might be really nice to get Remedy and Divine Light, that is encroaching on abilities that clerics spend their entire careers to earn.<P>Clerics are counted on for damaging a mob directly rarely, just as druids are counted on for healing rarely. If druids are given enough healing prowess to be counted on as secondary healers in ability as well as in name, then perhaps clerics would make the same arguments to have their damage abilities enhanced.

</FONT><HR>Campo,<BR>It would be much more accurate to say that druids are counted on for healing post 40 or 45ish rarely.  For the first 2/3 of the game, I served as primary healer often and secondary healer the rest of the time.  After 40, we really can't do this; this is *broken.*  When druids are young and inexperienced they can heal just fine, and as they grow more powerful they forget how?  What's up with that?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>     Well I'd just like to add my two cents to this entire discussion since it will affect me in someway in the future.  Though it's nice and good to promote grouping for classes by verant, that's not what all of us want all of the time.  One of the main reasons I started my druid way back in the day was because I got sick of trying to find groups as my war.  Druids are nice because ifyou can't find a group at the spur of the moment you can go be one with nature and kite a bit.<P>     Isn't that what druids should be doing?  Druids are solitary by nature so why shouldn't they be a little better than your average joe by themselves in the woods?  The druid is the master of the outdoors, a necro in.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for reducing the more than annoying fizzle rate on sup heal, but would I give up kiting for it?  No.  <P>     Yes, we aren't as needed on big raids as the other grouping classes, but hey... Who'd get there without us?  We're the taxis of the world.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  And if you know your role, any druid can find a nich in any big raid.  Just don't expect to be the be all end all healer or nuker and ya won't be let down.<P>     In closing, I thought verant did a great job with the druid class from the beginning, with a few minor quirks, and I don't wanna see a "nerf" to the class I've grown to love...<P><BR>Thanks all cyaz lata<BR>Thalindel Sylverfox<BR>56th Druid Saryrn<BR>Ancient Council<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here's a couple of suggestions.<P>1.  Fix our Kunark armor.  I agree that it should not have the AC of cleric or Shaman armor but what about the stats and effects?  Why does our armor have less wisdom and mana?  why does it have useless effects?  Chloroplast on the BP is somewhat pointless when we get group regrowth later on.  I can med up faster after group regrowth then I can after using my BP to cast chloro on my group.  SLD on our ES pants?  well ok, but even pre Kunark we had a better spells (SLN) which pretty much means this is for power leveling only.<P>2.  give us something unique to do.  Every other class has something unique that they do but we seem to be the jacks of all trades and masters of none.  Even in porting, which used to be our specialty, we are now eclipsed by wizards who can port to other planes and have translocate.  What is the defining element of a druid?  name me that and I'll be satisfied.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor.<P>Deepest thanks.  I can't begin to express my gratitude that these issues are being looked at.  The post 50 game is all about grouping.<P>Yes, it is possible to solo, and if that is the only way to advance due to RL time committments, then that's fine.  Those people should not be punished.  Contrary to the thread belief here, mutli-kiting is not the only way to get solo experience.  I swear, some people on these boards fixate WAY too much.<P>For the druids that group as much as possible - the proposed changes, if implemented, would add to the group desirability of the druid class in the post 50 game.<P>Superior Heal at 49 - good.<BR>Remedy (like) at 55 - awesome!<BR>Divine Light (like) at 60 - be still my heart!!<P>Combined with across the board reduced fizzle rates for heal spells post 50 (for all healing classes I hope) is outstanding news!<P>Jeeze.  With fast heals we might even be able to keep the cleric alive.  I really fail to see why some clerics are so ticked off about this.  Most high-end groups will still want a cleric to heal (and rez and buff and stun, etc).  Those type of groups will still prefer a backup healer for serious raids.  The pickup groups post 50 will have an option, albeit not a very safe one, to continue fighting sans cleric. <P>Couple new teleports would be a huge boon to opening up the world.  Not entirely sure thats what Verant wants.  Additional bind points have yet to go in.<P>One thing that concerns me that I did not see mentioned was removing the dungeon only tag from the Emerald Jungle/Skyfire druid evacs.  That all by itself would be a huge benefit to characters tasked with getting the raid members to any high-level Kunark dungeon.<P>The rest of the changes do not effect my gaming style at the moment so I leave it to more knowledgable druids to support those.<P>All in all, the proposed changes are more than I could have hoped for.<P>/bow<BR>/thank<P>Sincerely,<P>-Menyena<BR>55 druid<BR>32 cleric</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Most everyone I know feels that there should be more than one viable healing class in the game and that shaman and druid should fill that role. <P>Maybe a shaman can in some cases fill that role, thanks to slow, but in many more places they still cannot. There are almost no cases where a druiid can fill that role. The game would be much more fun for everyone, clerics included, if more things could be done, albeit less efficiently, with a shaman or druid as healer. These days just about anyone will take a jerk cleric over a nice druid or shaman, even if they are friends with the druid and dislike the cleric.  Need I say how messed up that is!<P>If both classes are increased  to be 66% to 75 % as efficent as a cleric, then we'd be in shape, though shaman would still be preferable due to slow, which is fine. <P>If not though, at least show some caring for the druid class by giving them something that is as generally desirable to groups as slow is for shaman. IE not THAT important, since the enchnater can handle it anyway, but still pretty darn nice to have if possible.<P>All druids REALLY need is something that will make groups want them, healing would be the best way to do it, as it would reduce the frustration that results from a single class having a chokehold on all high level endeavors. <P>Ask a hundred high level raid organizers they will tell you that druids, as a class, "suck" and are not needed. Many guilds have closed membership to future druid apllicants due to the fact that they are nothing more than a taxi cab class. Two druids cannot fill the primary healer role even close to as well as one cleric. <P>Perhaps a good way to deal with this would be to simply give druid and shaman a celstial heal type spell at 44, leave sup at 53 and make a BIG accross the board reduction to post 50 fizzle rates. <P>Just give groups a reason to want a druid. Every class should be wanted. Yes, some should be a bit MORE wanted. But since this is a game designed around grouping... Ultimate balance, and player satisfaction is going to hinge on everyone being in the same ballpark(roughly) when it comes to group desireability.<P><BR>Not everyone for everything. Having some encounters where a certain class is strongly advantageous, is GREAT. Having some encounters where a certain class is particularly weak is ok too. Some classes should have more cases where they are less desirable, due to other benefits of their class. But this narrowing of the game to the point that basically anything other than the ideal cleric/warrior/enchanter/rogue lineup feels like a waste, just isn't good for the game, or fair to the players. <P>The post 50 game is where people will ultimately be spending their time, and having some classes that are 90 times more desirable/less desirable than others at this point isn't healthy to player morale, or fair, or fun.<P>Group desirability in so group-centric a game is the only "power" a class has that matters, and is the key to any effort to finalize class balance in any real sense.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049494-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049494.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049494-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049494-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049494-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/049494-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=049494&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=049494&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
