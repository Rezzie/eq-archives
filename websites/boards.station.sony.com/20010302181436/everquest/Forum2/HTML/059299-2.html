</FONT><HR>Mesmashu<P>I am curious, what "tracert" program is this that is used by ISP's - HP OpenView, or CA-Total Control? Just curious<P>For those of you that are interested, go to this website and read the RFC's that pertain to how the internet backbone is made up www.faqs.orq Some very interesting reading and very technically orientated towards the rules and standards on how data packets pass through the internet.<P>For those of you that run DSL, cable, and other conntections remember the connection for your dsl/cable is ONLY to the point of presence that your provider has to the internet, it is not a direct route to the eq servers. So while you have it(and I am one of them with DSL), it only gets you to your provider faster, it is still subject ot the vagrances of the internet backbone routers.<P>For those of you that say well 200 of us, or my whole guild just went LD, it is a problem with the servers. Maybe, but not a solid statement. Lets take the following senario.<P>Players 1-100 - live on the east coast of the US<BR>Players 101-200 - live in the southeast of the US<BR>Players 201-300 - live in the midwest area<P>All 300 of the players are in different areas and the chances of them using the same ISP is minimal. They all connect to everquest via thier dsl, frac t1, oc3, dialup, cable modems. Playing along with no problems. <P>Now, even though they are in different locations of the US, using different providers, different forms of thier initial location. They all have something in common with their connection - what is that? Easy, they all have to pass their data through the internet backbone. Now the their data route may start off different, but because of the structure of the backbones, at some point in route the will ALL pass through the same router, maybe it is the last hop to everquest, or 3 hops back, it is the same router. <P>All of a sudden, this shared router has a problem or is taken OOS for service(happens often in the early morning hours). Suddenly all 300 of the players get a massive lag spike, go LD, disconnect.<P>Given the above senario, it is true that no matter where you are, who is your provider, what your connection is, you may all be affected by a single point of failure on the internet. This will not always be the servers, but a common router in your datapath.<P>Lets face it, the current makeup of the internet was not designed for the traffic that it is being hit with nowadays. Not much that can be done about that, arpnet, the base design for todays internet was created to pass data back and forth between military computers.<P>Something to think about<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

There is no hardware nor software on the internet that is perfect, including yours and ours. We try to make the best of cases where we know our network or our direct upstream provider is at fault, but our customer service department can't be responsible for every disconnect out there."<P>You're exactly right.  So why not make it so you cannot die while LD.  Because a few hundred idiots might go LD on purpose to prevent death and exp loss?  So what?  If they continue to do that, let them screw up their modem or pc.  We should not have to suffer because connections aren't 100% perfect.  Heck some aren't even 75%.  It is extremely frustrating to die while LD and loose half to a full bubble of exp.  If not for the exp loss, you would not have anywhere near the complaints you have now.<P>Please consider making PC's immune while LD, or dropping out of the game quicker.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I believe some client changes have been implemented in a recent patch that are causing broadband users to experience more frequent lag and subsequent LD. It appears to be some sort of sensitivity issue as I have done extensive performance tests back to Verant servers and cannot see any appearant network performance issue. My experience does not seem to be tied to the number of people in a particular zone as I've experienced this in EC and LoIO with ~120 peeps and Lavastorm with 8. It does seem to track with overall peak periods of EQ game activity as it seems to lessen around 12am EST.<P>Hope someone from Verant reads this. Will be more than happy to provide my data. Overall hope --&gt; Please fix it!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have to say, with my modem connection, that I get disconnected more often than not. My cleric has to summon his hammer and food again. <BR> But I will say this. There have been a few times that I went LD and it was verant. How do I know this? Because my summoned hammer was still in my hand.<BR> My point is this. If Verant is going to be like typical tech support and not help you when its their fault. Then they will be losing alot of customers.I has not happened to me yet, but when the day does come that a whole zone goes down, like Lake of ill Omen did last week, and I just happen to lose exp for dying. I believe verant will be rezzing my corpse, Or I will be finding another service.<BR> Lets hope things get better...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Abashi you crack me up. Im not even going to read all the posts just respond to yours. I have over 5 accounts, Yes 5 paying accounts. I run a network at home and at my office. What you are saying to these people that its never VERANT's fault im sorry bro but I know 100% fact that most times it is Verant. Example we are having problems with cerfnet, our network is down. My biggest complaint is when a ZONE crashes and they do nothing. You guys need to start taking what the customers say and live with the fact that once inwhile so what you have to logon for 2-3 hours doing nothing but ressing. I remeber back in Feb-June of 1999 GM's were alowed and use to res on the fly. Now you all use the excuse that its not a verifable bug. Well get a loggin system cause there are ALOT of bugs in the world of Norath and it begins with Verant.<P>Cerpox PlaneSmasher</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Cerpox,<P>Most of those "zone crashes" aren't.<P>Yeah, maybe 50-90% of the people in the zone lose conn.  But how did those 10-50% stay connected?  You think they're all on Verant's LAN?<P>If you've got five friends using all your machines, and three of them lose connectivity, but two keep going... did your home router lose conn?  No.  Did it happen "on your end"?  Maybe sort of... but no, not really.  Was there a hiccup somewhere between your home network and the internet that because of timing cause three of your machines to lose conn while the other two didn't?  Probably so.<P>Also, if you're going to respond to Abashi, at least do him the service of reading his post.  He said: "We try to make the best of cases where we know our network or our direct upstream provider is at fault, but our customer service department can't be responsible for every disconnect out there."  That's far from him "saying to these people that its never VERANT's fault."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Abashi, <BR>    That answer is not acceptable.  If 500-1000 ppl get booted at about the same time, those that died due to a mass network error, be it at VIs end or on a backbone, those that died deserves resses. The main reason for gms refusing resses has been the fear of exploit by ppl killing their connection right before the die. If this many ppl flood the chatroom complaining about server dumps , regardless of what your "records" show there is a problem. Customer service is been proven to be a primary issue with consumers and if VI can't handle this people will leave.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I witnessed a friend die during the massive lag linkdeaths last night.  He is a 35 Paladin and was attacked by two greens.  <P>They somehow managed to get him down to half health but he was never in any danger even having Lay of Hands at his disposal (mobs were at like 1 bub each as I was helping him) he went from half health at the point when lag struck to dead in one instant.<P>He petitioned and after ten or fifteen minutes without a response we did a who all and found a Guide was in the zone right next to where he died.  He VERY politely sent a single tell to the guide and explained his dilemma and waited hopefully for a good response and a few minutes later was rezzed.  He provided his exact loc of his corpse to the Guide and I provided supporting testimony to ensure the Guide what he had said was true.<P>While I realize this is not the correct way to go about this and certainly expect that lag deaths or linkdeath deaths are not normally rezzed, you should follow this guildeline and you might have better chance of getting what you would like IF your GM's guides are as nice as ours.  <P>Server name withheld for the protection of our NICE GM's and GUIDES.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059299-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/059299.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=059299&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=059299&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
