</FONT><HR>Stop taking away things from your loyal players Verant, this new Nerf is indeed perhaps one of the worse things Ive heard in a long time.<BR>First of all, the breastplate isnt overpowered, because at the higher levels, the heavy mobs in Vellious are almost impossible to kill WITH the Bp. <BR>Second of all youre cruel for giving the clerics such a nice item that in its very nature breaks some of the mind numbing monotony of sit...stand...cast blah blah....Its not terribly diffrent, but its  nice to have and it certainly gives the clerics some range.<BR>Third YOUR RIDICULOUSLY INCAPABLE servers cannot hold many more than 35 people on a raid because everyone goes LD when the battle begins and the datarate rises...Going LD sucks when your fighting klandicar, so therefore bringing more players to the mix is no solution for the hole you are leaving us.<BR>Fourth, what gives you the right to take away something that brings your loyal customers such joy and pride. These people worked their asses off to earnthe privelage to win (or be merited) such a nice object and for you to so callously take away their PROPERTY (yes THEIR PROPERTY) is heinous.<BR>Y'know, I love Everquest, because at the moment its the best thing out there, however once someone else releases a game that doesnt have a horrid particle system, too much downtime, monotonous boring repettive fights and an ENTIRELY uninteractive invironment you people are going to hear a huge sucking sound on your servers that will symbolize the mass migration from EVERNERF to the next game where perhaps we will find a much better product.<BR>Because changing an item after it has been in play for so long due to the mewling whining of the jealous gamers who want what they feel they cannot have is ENTIRELY UNNACEPTABLE.<BR>Oh and in closing, its really not a matter of IF someone else gets the next MMRPG right, its WHEN.<BR>Verant you have a LARGE client base, but I assure you you do not have a LOYAL client base.<BR>Stop the low blows....<BR>Release an item...STICK WITH IT.<BR>Dont like it?<BR>Then use your brains next time before releasing(and designing mobs around) such an item.<BR>Marken Logan <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

This kind of crap makes me want to log off my Cleric and just not log her back on again.  <P>Verant continually listens to the whining masses of wannabe clerics and we are nerfed once again.  You have turned us from a fun class to a class that now just heals, buffs and meditates.  No longer do we bash, no longer can we enjoy the nuking or meleeing side.  You made fun of us with the lame pet you "gave" us, now you take away an item that truely had worth to the L60 raids on these dragons.  <P>As far as you saying 2 clerics  and a warrior can take down ANY mob in EQ, I say BULL****!  Prove It to me.  You show ME where ANY 2 clerics with a Donal's BP can heal a warrior on a L60+ mob alone and I'll eat Crow for a week.

</FONT><HR>Well, I think you suck for changing Donal's BP again after all this time, but I'm sure that this is the standard thick-skulled Verant move, in which in amount of reasoning from the players is duly ignored...  it's an item which so few people will ever have that it CANNOT possibly affect game balance enough to matter in any real way.<P>This "buff" idea is stupid.  7.5 minutes of delay, and you feel it's still necessary to leave the casting time at 30 seconds.  Uhhh, ok...whatever.  How about this:  instead of coming up with moronic solutions to a [non-existent] problem, why not just remove the friggin CH effect?  I'm sick of arguing with VI and the band of envious ass-kissers who applaud these nerfs because they will never have this item anyway.<P>Take the CH off, please.  Give us Invisibility (my personal preference).  Give us a group +32 AC buff.  Give us a 30 sec cast time Aegolism as other people have suggested.  Anything [useful] but this half-assed idea you came up with yesterday.<P>--Xy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm a cleric and I actually agree with this nerf. I didn't agree with Karn though.<P>The Breastplate was unbalancing, plain and simple. <P>There is a mindset about this item, one that is unhealthy for the game. It is considered a pre-requisite for high level raiding in Velious. I suspect even after this change it will still be seen as needed / required.<P>Any item that is held in this respect will be nerfed, Verant has held tight to this standard, and I respect that. At least they have the balls to do what really needs to be done. And they are willing to take the flack for it.<P>I have seen this coming, as I have seen the 'ubers' blame failures on lack of Donals (breastplates). <P>The truth is this was brought on from Verants recent observations of the first explorers of Sleeper's Tomb. Apparently a small group of characters were able to take out the smaller creatures of the zone, with the employment of a Donals Breastplate or two. <P>Usually this is the case of any nerf, A battle was won with less than X (players) with less than Y (deaths) in less than Z (time). Where the variables equal Verants expectations of what is needed to win minimally.<BR> <BR>There were many ways this item could be used in Kunark and in the Old World. A cleric and a melee could realistically solo any number of mobs at the same time, as long as A) the melee could keep them all taunted and B) they didn't kill that melee in less than the casting time of the Breastplate. This could be the Hand room in Karnor's it could be Efreeti, or Fire Giants.. it IS rather powerful.<P>Absor, <P>As some of my peers have pointed out, it did not take us 6 months to figure out the capabilities of this item. That is a flawed statement. First of all Trakanon was first killed at least one or two months into Kunarks release, he wasnt killed for three or four across the other servers. And I "highly" doubt that 300,000 players have ever held in their possession a Donals Breastplate.  In my best estimates there are no more than 100-150 on all the servers combined. Please do not patronize us.<P>One thing I believe most of us are worried about is that Velious was tested with knowledge of this item firmly in place. What kind of changes will be made to compensate for this?<P>Thank you for your well thought out presentation, although it was clearly lost on a lot of people  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">. I think your doing a great job so far.<P>-Jovius 57th Templar<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is INSANE - DO you guys KNOW that some mobs can simply NOT be beaten without an appropriate amount of donal BP's? YOU make mobs hit for 700 quad, ae fear, ae dot, give them 200k HPs, (i'm thinking klandicar-zlandicar-yelinak-rumbleroot, and other top SOV encounters)<P>the item comes from TRAKANON which means it takes a strong guild to kill him and some effort. Do you really think that a lvl60 cleric with donal's BP is gonna screw around powerleveling like that? of course the donal BP is used in RAIDS - you nerf that, watch the clerics quit. all you have given us is nerfs. seriously, whoever's made this sick decision needs to be closed in a mental asylum - that, or make him start a cleric and play him to 60 from lvl1 and then realize the stupidity of such an idea.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wow... I read through 5 and a half pages of this and not one person caught it... this supposed 'nerf' is going to make this BP even MORE powerful! Personally I think it was fine the way that it was... but of it get this upgrade bring it on! Nope.. I am ***NOT*** being sarcastic. Keep in mind:<P>1) They are going to change this to a buff which CANNOT be dispelled (they have stated this twice). OMG this is great! Make sure it is in the first slot and you are good to go! How? Two ways. Either figure out what buff it overwrites and make sure it is the 1st buff OR if it doesn't overwrite anything then put a  SoW in the 1st slot. After all buffs are in place, have the character cancel the SoW and then have the cleric buff em!<P>2) If this buff lasts for 8 minutes then the tanks will be REALLY tough for those 8 minutes since none of their buffs can be torn down! The longer it lasts the better it gets (remember, top buff gets dispelled 1st). Shoot, I say make it 15 minutes in length.<P>Keep in mind the following though:<P>1) From what I have read, it seems like MOST people don't feel this was really too powerful to begin with.<P>2) The heart of the issue seems to be whether or not CH is too powerful. A considerable number of ppl think that it is but  they are clearly not the majority.<P>3) As stated earlier though, there are no healing spells between 900 hp and a CH. Seems like adding at least a 1200pt heal AND a 2500pt heal is definately order.<P>Many people have said that rather than see this Uber-God-Level-Buff on the BP they would rather see:<P>1) A self only invis.<BR>2) A fatigue regen that would be worthwhile.<BR>3) A decent HP/AC buff.<BR>4) A better Regen. buff.<BR>5) Aegism (sp?)<BR>6) A straight mana add.<BR>7) Superior Heal<P>Some ideas not presented:<P>1) A self only gate to WC (that way Dark Elf clerics will find it useful as well as good clerics).<P>2) A group evac. that costs no mana but useable only once per day (emergency use only in other words).<P>3) An Uber Cleanse. It would cure ALL diseases and poisons on you and then heal the target for say 1000pts of damage. Not overpowering but still very useful.<P>4) Divine Aura with a recharge time of one second. Sure the cleric can't be hurt but so what? He can't heal (his main function btw), attack, cast spells... he just sits there like a bump on a log.<P>Most of the above four aren't very good ideas. I just threw them out there to show that OTHER ideas are possible (albeit not very good ones).<P>Absor has already said that it IS going to be nerfed. He has stated this twice and I doubt that he is going to change his mind. Keep in mind though that his 'nerf' isn't a nerf at all and will actually make this item even MORE powerful than it already is atm.<P>I would like to make  a simple request... I know that many of you feel justifiablely angry. I know that it is hard to supress that anger. Please do try however. The best way to get a change made in your favor is to present you case in a calm rational manner. If more people can do that, then we have a MUCH better chance of getting the nerf of our choice rather than the one we hate the most.<P>Thanks for reading this post.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Jesus i cannot believe the short sightedness of this decision.  There are what? Maybe 10 Bp's at the tops 20 on any server? This changes the balance? What a joke. How can anyone use this justification Using a Donal's during an Epic battle is a LAST resort you idiots.  Having this BP has not changed the tactits against uber mobs.<P>Do you honestly think a cleric takes 60 hrs a weak to powerlevel anyone? Absor I hope they hired you for your talents and not your brains because your logic lacks completely.  The cleric is probably by far the most boring character in the game. Med heal sit med cast sit med cast and you think the BP has an unreasonable affect on the game. Get real if anyone has taken the time to get a cleric to 60 more power to them.  <P>Congratulations guys you have just proven to me that you really don't have much of a clue or care for the people that play this game.  Its sad too we 55-60 clerics that have worked for our rewards have seen ever nerf in the book sadly enough its not over yet... </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think you should just completely scrap the current version of the Donal's BP, go back to the drawing board and come up with something new. Quite frankly, as you said yourself, this whole idea is flawed from it's very roots. Anything you'd do to try to balence it further would just increase it's silliness and quite probably uselessness.<P>My own recomendation? Send this back to the item design team, tell them to make a cleric item with a right-click that is "useful in most fights, both grouping and raiding" and see what they come up with, but dont tell them they're looking for a replacement to the Donal's BP effect. There's a point where you need to sweap the slate clean and start over fresh, i think we're there.<P>Fizzi<BR>High Priest of Innoruuk, E'Ci</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, no, I don't give up.  Not yet.<P>Alan, look...  It's not like every Cleric and his dog has one of these.  It's not exactly something you put on your twink, either.  And IIRC, there's a minimum level for casting the CH off of it.<P>This item is *not* unbalanced!  It's got a 30-second casting time, for God's sake.  That's a long time when you're hoping that your spell will go off without an interrupt.  Hell, ten seconds is.  It's a long time when you're hoping that Cleric will be able to get off the CH in time to heal you.<P>The thirty seconds already made it a downtime item.  Now you're removing that entirely.  Why?  Because a few Clerics--what, maybe a dozen out of the 50,000 players that are on every night?--decided to use this as a mana-free but HIGH RISK battle tactic.<P>Not an exploit.  A battle tactic.  Because anything with a 30 second cast time is not likely to be exploitable.<P>For God's sake, guys, leave it alone already.  Enough is enough.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I can't believe what I read here. People claiming Complete Heal is unbalancing. Without CH this game would be UNPLAYABLE!!! Every one of the people stating CH is unbalacing is under level 50 or I couln't understand it. 90% post 50 mob in this game requires a cleric with complete heal. This is a fact. <BR>Now lets see what statement there is here:<P>A warrior cleric combo can defeat every Mob that can't kill the warrior in 30 secs. <P>There simply is no post 50 mob that can't kill a warrior in 30 secs. This change is aimed at uber guilds like FoH Afterlife and others who got like 5 to 10 of the BP and 5 clerics chaincasting CH on 1 warrior to kill a mob making it effectively a CH every 5 secs. So what? They are trying to kill mobs with 1 million HP, insane regen and uber resists. <P>If you nerf this BP you effectively make it impossible to kill 90% of the boss mobs in SoV. Every one who now shouts for a nerf will never ever be able to kill such a mob. <P>The problem here is Verant and the zone design. If more than 50 people at one spot wouldn't make us all go linkdead we might be able to kill one of those mobs you generously designed with 1 million HP but as you know that isn't possible. If you nerf that BP you have to lower the HP of those mobs by a margin greater than 75% to make it posoible to kill them.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OOC.<BR>Sigh, reluctantly I understand the need for this nerf. Pity it was ever there though, as something gained and then taken away is far more annoying to those that had than something never had (I've never had, but I feel for those that do). Like the original MoK, this BP effect was overpowered.<P>However, with this fix, there is no longer a need to mess with the CH spell, but to put the cast time back to the normal CH cast time of 10 seconds, as a mana-free CH once every 5mins or 7.5mins or whatever cannot be seen as unbalancing even with the normal cast time.<P>Some time I'd love MoK to be made more useful again - not the original power, but just to the point of being of some value.<P>As to some of the whiners who say CH itself is imbalanced, sheesh that's stupid. Remove CH, remove the cleric class, it is our defining spell at high levels. There are always jealous whiners sigh.

</FONT><HR>I have to agree with the guys on Verant on this.  On any NORMAL RAID ! Most mobs die within 30 seconds anyway due to the fact the is normally at least 20 people on them.  It is a shame that it took 6 months to figure out, but hey , we're not all perfect.  I look at this Breast Plate and think, very nice item, uber rare, of very hard dragon.  One of the reasons this was introduced into the game was because of the increase in MOB damage output and HP.  Thus was was geared more to the large group, or raid type of game.  Not your cleric/warrior combo.<P>This answer here is simple, make it benifit more people that it does now.  Make the BP a group heal, of say 400-500 Hit Points, keep the recast time or make a little longer.  This would be a lovely item.  Considering most warriors fully buffed have going on upto 5k worth of hit points, I cannot see how this would be overbalancing.  The BP was introduced due to the needing to group and raid at the higher end game, make it more popular for that.  I couldnt imagine many clerics complaining about a group heal of 400 - 500 HP.  <P>If they did, then they are just being selfish.<P>Hey if that dont work, make it self only.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Unfortunately, it appears they are nerfing this because of the strategies used by some of the well-known uber guilds. These guilds have a HUGE number of high lvl characters and have beat down every mob VI has put against them. VI doesnt like that. So, in an effort to stop this, they nerf a VERY nice tactic used by guilds that have multiple Donals Breastplates at their disposal. <P>Unfortunately, the 99% of the EQ population who will be lucky if they even get a Donal's Breastplate will now get the nerf (2x) version.<P>VI tunes the game to the uber guilds and powergamers, not the casual gamer. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You people who think CH is unbalancing need to play past level 10. And you people who think that the Donal's BP is unbalancing have no conception WHATSOEVER about how strong Velious mobs are. Derakor the Vindicator quads for 700 a pop, has about 250k hp; Velketor the Sorcerer quads for 850 a pop, has about 150k hp...and they almost never miss and can't be slowed. Did I mention that these mobs are WEAK compared to mobs like King Tormax?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>VERANT, i know you never read my post or never care. But here is a word of advise, Nurfing group support class is a stupid idea, in fact your job is to make these classes as happy as posible. So what if a warrior and a cleric can kill most mobs, a warrior a cleric and another class can kill more. What are you going to do next burff it so casters can't cast no more cuase we hit too hard? You made it so you need 30+ ppl to kill one mob now with this nurf you are going to need 45+ ppl to kill the same mob, and it's not a big deal, but if you ****ING servers could handle 45+ ppl casting spells then it wouldn't be a problem.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Whatever...<P>I'm so glad that my RARE drop item of the DRAGON Trakanon is going to be FAR LESS usefull then the easily Farmed PoG BP. Time to get the tractors out and hit PoG and look like every other 50+ cleric on the server.<P>You just dont get it. 30 sec cast time that can be interupted is allready a huge risk. I have to make the choice to risk other party members while healing one. 7.5 min recast on a player time LOL. WHATEVER.<P>Isn't this supposed to be a GAME and are not games supposed to be fun. Why don't you try to put some new fun aspects in it instead of spending your time nerfing HARD EARNED RARE ITEMS. GOD I wish i didnt have 100+ Days of my life invested in a hobby that others can waltz in and change negatively for me. <P>Please stop and try using your time and resources in a way that makes us want to stick around for Star Wars and EQ2. With your history in customer satisfaction I will not be giving you any more revenue for future games. My Household has 3 accts. That will start to add up as people get more frustrated.<P>Guess we should have taken "Your in Our World Now" as a Warning.<P>Varya Valorvixen<BR>56 Templar<BR>Fires of Heaven<BR>Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 11 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052857-11.html">11</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052857&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052857&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
