</FONT><HR>P.S. Cheesy, thank you for your concern, and offering your suggestion.  That technique is known as "parking" or "ghetto mez" and is used often for crowd control when there is no enchanter available.  However, any mob over level 51 summons you, so just keeping them from moving doesn't help.  <P>Also, just as a note for the general fund of player knowledge, it is a BAD idea to root a 'shroom reaver on top of the zone-out portal down there near the shroom king room.  Seems that this WILL result in an involuntary evac of your entire party, one at a time.  It also results in the tanks proccing swear words, similar to the way they do when they are slowed.  <P>Drisanna Haelan<BR>High Priestess of Brell<BR>"Ready rez?" <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, someone said something about clerics being overpowered well I have only one word for that "NOT" . A guildmate of mine need a TP to the commons from FM and she was 55 well, while I was getting to her she decided to some friends in FM. so I went to FM to get her  (me 35 druid) well  when I zoned in all I get in guild chat was her screaming "OH CRAP".  So I went into overdrive and I found her fighting four level 30-35 mobs. I checked her health she was very very low, so I decided to give here a heal. well the next thing I new was I had 2 of them on me her friends were trying to help, but I guess they werent high enough or something. SO I started root kiting the mobs.<P>well we all survived. between me and her we killed the mobs, she said that all she did was heal one of her friends and next thing she new was all four of the mobs were on her and they kept interupting her cast,  but when a level 55 cleric cant even keep herself alive while fighting level 30-35 mobs then that means they arent overpowered.<P>I can only imagine how bad it must be fight something even higher.<P>Something needs to be done if it hasnt been done already. I dont want to lose the cleric friends I have even after the cookie verant gave the druids.<P>The way I look at the druid class is I'm there to keep the cleric alive  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">. we are a support class arent we? </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sinnyin:<P>Malaia may not like Baven at all, but I agree with her 100%.<P>Baven's use of holocaust imagery and sneaking in analogies that compare Verant to the Gestapo during the Holocaust is just vile.  It really makes me want to vomit.  I don't care how valid his point may or may not be (cause I do tend to agree with his argument), the analogy he uses is just sick.  His point could have been made without such a grim analogy and only reflects what type of person Baven truly is.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My my my.....How quickly an inteligent thread was hijacked by a 20th level nobody and some person with a chip on her shoulder.<P>Was the holocost imagery appropriate?  Maybe not.<P>Did you gather any thing from what he said aside from that?  Or anything from all the posts after?  Probably not.<P>But like a rabid pavlovian dog you sure can go after him for using an analogy you don't approve of.<P>Well, it was a nice thread back before about page 3.  Kinda went downhill from there, but I suspect that with some people that's a valid arguing tactic: "Bog them down with off subject trivia and kill their thread."<P>Nice job, way to go.<P>Sara</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree with many of the posts on this board, especially Baven's and Naelya's.<P>I have played a cleric or healer type in every game I have played online for the past 6 years. Obviously, I love the healer role. <P>It was with a heavy heart, I came into the game on Tuesday night after the patch.  I have a PoG BP that I used frequently during mass cr. Use epic, heal with CE...it was a huge benefit to both me and my guildmembers.  It was a feel-good item for me..for the benefit of others. The cast time at 18 seconds did not make it viable for use in major battles.<P>I cast it upon a poor soul who was obviously injured, he zoned before the heal could take effect one minute later.  I sat down, said farewell to my guild and camped out. I have not been back in the game since.<P>You see to me it was the icing on the proverbial cake when they nerfed that BP. Kind of like getting a Christmas present, only to have your parents take it away because it was to dangerous.<P>There have so many things happen to this game in the two years I've played to "balance" it to Verant's way of thinking.  The latest series, unfortunately has occured to my favorite class, and is but several of many. I truly believe it is a systematic approach to remove the cleric class from the game or make it undesirable to play.<P>There is a reason for my sadness. The joy I once had in helping others has been diminished. A game I love, my friends, my guildmates, gamers I don't even know will be impacted by these recent changes.  Will it balance the game? I don't believe so.  <P>I cannot speak for others, only myself, I do know that it will be a very long time before I play a cleric...if ever.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm afraid that you must have me confused with someone else.  I don't play on Povar.<P>I'm afraid you also have me confused with someone else if you think I don't understand the holocost or it's effects on people that lived through it and those that didn't.<P>However, I don't see how your complaints are germaine to this conversation.  He made his analogy, it was appropriate within the context that he wrote it, but I don't think you understand that.<P>I guess you also don't understand the concept of satire.  I guess Jonathan Swift just wrote stupid stories and you don't think they should be read.<P>The use of satire to make a point is a time honored one and one that is effective.  Hyperbole analogies are acceptable if they communicate the concept one is trying to communicate.<P>And as to conversations with your grandmother, they are not necessary.  She has my sympathies, YOU do not.  Get off your soapbox.  Your rants are pointless and you are not the only person who's grandparents had to go through that.  My own grandmother faced the same thing in Shanghai at about the same time.<P>I just don't see how it pertains to this issue.  He used satire to make a hyberbole analogy.  Get over it.  He started a conversation that MANY have contributed to with thoughtful insight.  But after all this time, continue with your efforts to get this thread locked because YOU PERSONALLY don't like an analogy used in THE VERY FIRST THREAD.  <P>Brilliant.  Good work.  Keep it up.  As the thread is anti-Verant, you will probably succeed.<P>Sara</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There are two completely seperate issues here. <P>1) The cleric agro, which for the most part both Malaia and I have said we agree with.<P>2) Baven's extremely poor use of analogy.  Comparing Verant to the Gestapo and the leaving clerics to all those that were "lost" in concentration camps have NOTHING WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH EACH OTHER!  The ONLY reason Baven uses it as an analogy is he knows that it is a contraversial subject that will evoke a certain image as well as a response (either pos or neg, but a response none the less) and gain his post added attention.<P>The cleric healing issue has the ability to carry itself without being compared to the Holocaust.  Baven combined the two issues to give his argument an added support that it didn't need nor was warranted, nor was graceful.  It was downright vile.  In all seriousness, how oculd ANYONE compare the Holocaust to clerics leaving a game they no longer want to play?  It is completely inappropiate, and I am moreso appalled by the fact that this appears to be a minority of the feeling on this subject rather than his initial post which was plenty disturbing by itself.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Tell them how the eradication of the jewish people was remotely similar to clerics being aggro'd on heals and their breast plates being nerfed. Tell them how exactly like the nazis that Verant is.<P>Go on.. would you DARE post somethign like that there? You think that its harmless because its some out of the way message board?

</FONT><HR>Malaia<P>   I'm sorry to hear about your grandmother or whomever in your family was placed in a concentration camp. However, I think your first post sufficed. All your replies are out of context and have no place in this thread. You may argue that Baven's detail regarding those issues should have no place in his original post. However, he was making a comparison to attempt to prove an extreme point. Could it be taken the wrong way, and have people freaking out? I suppose so seeing your replies to it. However I recommend simply not posting, as you are not adding to the discussion with any constructive input. I have relatives who were in war, thrown into pow camps, and killed. I'm sure we all do, however I don't make it a point to bring those details up as a rebuttle for a completely different topic. I recommend you do the same. Comments from you flooding this topic are not going to help achieve the original intent of the post: to help the cleric population and reach out to Verant to reverse their poor decisions. <P>On a side note: I agree 100% with Baven's original post. so Bump.<P>Zarach Lionstar<BR>High Priest - Proud brother of Deven<BR>The Harmonium - Xev<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I hate to inform you but it does appear Verant is totally ignoring Cleric concerns at this point.... but yet Absor saw fit to respond to a Druid thread.... interesting yes?<P>Verant has made it extremely clear that Clerics "are balanced" but yet they continue to "tune" Clerics or change the very basis of how we MUST function as a class... I find this confusing. Either we ARE balanced or we ARE NOT balanced. Please choose one.<P>I would very much like to see Absor re-open the Cleric Class Talk threads and EXPLAIN to us why Verant keeps "tuning" Clerics and yes.... WHY IT MUST BE DONE. Contrary to popular belief the majority of Clerics are intelligent individuals and we can fully comprehend detailed explainations. We might even suprise Verant and explain to THEM a few things on how Clerics really work in high end areas and why we do certain things and not others.<P>Had Verant presented the Donals BP prior to its release to the Clerics as a whole I could have told them EXCATLY how this item would have been used. Perhaps it would have prevented it from ever entering the game.... hard decision yes.... but far easier than having an item and then having it nerfed into utter uselessness. Perhaps we might have gotten an item that would NOT have been nerfed... like a Group Shield of Words.... or a single target Bulwark of Faith.<P>Verant also went overboard on nerfing the PoG and quested BPs... these items DO NOT make high end encounters possible. The Dain hitting for quad 450s per round is hardly offset with 300 hitpoints healed every 6 seconds. These BPs are good for perhaps the Crypt area of Sebilis (Spore King and Juggs/Reets would have been beyond these BPs to make a significant difference) but even then I dont know I would call it "unbalancing".... simply changing the casting time to 30 seconds would have easily resolved EVERY issue Verant had with these BPs but still let be somewhat useful and Clerics wouldnt have SO unhappy with the change.<P>Verant is NOT listening to us though are they? We asked for more group buffs to decrease the tedium of buffing our groups (upping the mana cost to compensate was expected) and we got:<P>Aegolism nerfed from a Group Buff to Single Target Buff.... (I read ALL the posts in the Cleric Talk threads and I dont recall anyone ever asking for this.... perhaps my memory is failing?) <P>We asked for our CORE spells (healing) to be sold on vendors.... but we have the majority of Clerics who STILL dont have Celestial healing... a dinky lvl 44 healing spell but yet we cant seem to find enough of them. Oddly enough though I see other classes core spells drop frequently or *gasp* being sold on Vendors. <P>Clerics asked for Abolish Disease (we have Abolish Poison... and Cure Disease so the precedent is there)... we get nothing but silence. <P>Clerics asked for Peridot costs to be examined since we and the Enchanters get hit hard with this.... we are met again with silence.<P>Clerics asked for a self-invis spell or perhaps Invis potions to be stackable... Clerics are told we will NEVER be given a Self-Invis spell and total silence on the potion stacking issue. However Wizards are given Invis to Undead.... I didnt read ALL of the Wizard Talk threads but I dont recall this being a "burning" issue for them.<P>Cleric asked to remain THE Supreme Healer Class since we are so limited in what we CAN do.... Druids are given 2 of Clerics best healing spells but none of their solo'ing abilities are touched.<P><BR>See the trend?<P><BR>Clerics asked for some VERY minor tweaks to reduce tedium and we are either met with total silence or our spells and items are nerfed in the name of "balance"... or our spells are simply farmed out to other classes. Personaly I'll take the silence to our concerns please...<P>Clerics have been chipped away at long enough... Paladins get most of our best buffs at high levels as well as a Res spell....(this doesnt bother me SO much as Palading are a Hybrid of Clerics)... Necros are given Harm Shield that works excatly as Divine Aura does (but the Necro version recycles every 5 mins to our 18 mins) ... Necros are given a Res spell then while not ideal to use in most situations is totally contrary to their "nature".... Druids are given 2 of the Clerics best spells to increase their groupability<BR>while our Shaman brothers are left out.<P>Yes.... Clerics are being phased out... slowly... gradually.... one spell and one item at a time.<P><BR>Naelya<BR>Lvl 59 Cleric<BR>Foundation Rathe<BR>The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Zarach:<P>You think Malaia's posts are off topic.  I KNOW Baven relating a few clerics leaving EQ to the Holocaust is WAY off topic.  It is really sick that you can just overlook his abuse of a certain subject matter, the Holocaust, he is blatantly exploiting in order to evoke a more emotional reaction to his post.  <P>I am sorry but a few clerics leaving a video game is in NO WAY similar to an entire race of people nearly being wiped off the face of the planet simply because of their beliefs.  No one made Baven compare one to the other.  He chose to do so of his own accord.  But, bumping this thread is in essence trivializing what the Holocaust was all about.  And sadly so many of you posting either are totally oblivious to that fact, or just could care less.<P>I don't mind the thread on Cleric heal agro, in fact I agree with most of it.  However Baven has ruined his post by his completely inappropriate comparison.  This thread should be dropped and just restart it without the insensitive comparison of something so insignificant as clerics leaving EQ to the Holocaust.  It is just sick.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Thank you Grummp....<P>I have been a damned good Cleric for almost 2 years now and I take my chosen Class "seriously". Clerics are so pigeon-holed into such a narrow role by the very nature of our spells I now fear for the very survival of the class at the higher levels. I have no intention of my class ability being redefined as a "Res-Mule".<P><BR>Perhaps it was our fault for failing to speak out sooner... or louder... we do tend to be a passive class dont we? I wonder now if it's too late to undo some of the damage that has been done. Too many of my brother and sisters have truly logged off for the last time and canceled their accounts and I forsee many more in the very near future... and sadly to say perhaps myself included. <P><BR>Even if Verant reversed all the recent nerfs to our class we still wouldnt fully recover from the loss of those Clerics who will never return.... the knowledge they possessed is gone forever and it leaves a void for those of us who remain... I wonder how vast and deep the void will be when those few of us who still hold on finally log off and hit that Cancel Account button? All the tactics and knowledge we have acquired over the last 2 years will be irrevocably lost.... then who will teach those who are coming behind us? I learned much of my classes abilities by asking older clerics and by watching.... who will the next generation ask or watch?<P><BR>Yes... I fear for the viability of the Cleric Class if this trend continues. But somehow I doubt Verant will reconsider thier persecution and destruction of one of the most beloved Classes... and when we leave how viable will Verants "Vision" be then?<P><BR>Naelya<BR>lvl 59 Cleric<BR>Foundation Rathe<BR>The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Aluriel,<P>I resent the fact that you related Malaia's post to an angered pavlovian dog!  My great great great grandfather use to train pavlovian dogs and it's no joke to compare people to them!  How can you be so insensitive! <P>/Sarcasm off<P>Malaia and Rebu need to realize this subject is not about POLITICS, it's about the game.  Hello in there, are you listening?  Good.. Now read the post and tell me the context of it, not what analogies you disagree with.<P>Sheesh<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/066049-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/066049.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/066049-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/066049-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/066049-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/066049-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=066049&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=066049&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
