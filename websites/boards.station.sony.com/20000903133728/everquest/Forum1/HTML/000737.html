</FONT><HR>Why is 7:30 Pacific the standard patch time anyway? Is it the time of least server activity (good customer service), or just when Verant folks ramble in to the office (bad customer service)? My guess is that a whole lot less people would be screaming if you did the server updates at 2am or something like that. My guess is the sacrifice by the people who load/test patches would be preferential to the scads of e-mail, phone calls, and angry-grams that the front line CS people get. If everything goes well, give the patch team the rest of the day off and a mini-golf coupon or something.<P>Oh well, just my two cents.<P>-B77</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>What part of this is unclear?  They are partially through a patch thats replacing dll's.  Things aren't going to work right.  Starting to tweak your system when they aren't done is brash.  Blaming it on someone else is dumb.  <P>I'm really trying to understand what the complaint here is.  They are patching the servers AND the client.  You can not play during this time.  Every patch is a result of player comments and Live Teams hours of work.  Downtime is the only way to implement YOUR requests.  What is 6 hours out of one week?  3%?

</FONT><HR>Same thing happening to me, get an illegal operation, first one i've ever had since getting the game.    Here's a question, why does the downtime have to be so long?    Why can't each server be done one at a time, with an hour downtime each or something?   Instead of taking all down for almost half a day.    I don't know exactly how your patching system works, but something tells me 6, 8, or 10 hours is just too long to put in a simple patch.<P>The downtime just seems a little excessive to me, looks like at this rate, the downtime probably adds up to a full month over the course of a year, so I think all EQ customers should get a free month of service per year for putting up with all the downtime.<P>And how about a little in game warning before the patch is put in, like at 10 PM PT on the night before a patch, send an all server message that says scheduled patch for whenever time.    Not everyone goes to these websites to check for patch updates, and most of the time there isn't much warning on the site either.     And even hourly reminders would be good, I'd hate to be one of the people starting a long hard camp 2 hours before the server comes down.   Or you could add a message that automatically appears when people first log on, so everyone knows what is happening, instead of over half the people surprised and angry that they get a message that the servers are coming down in 30 minutes for over 6 hours.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ok, here is my gripe! I appreciate the down time of 6 hrs to fix problems. All programs must have that. However, it's more like 12 hrs + a week!. Meanwhile, I'm not able to access a product I'm paying for, yet I am indeed charged for all the down time. My theory is that Verant uses this time to take turns having time off. I for one am going to start paying only for time used. Also, share the down time internationally. I'm tired of being penialized for living in the EST!!!!!!! I would appreciate an honest response please. Dragon Queen Artesia</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Did you whine to the manager that you had a coupon for a service, by golly, and you had a right to redeem it at a time of your choosing?<P>Think of EQ as a country club.  Your membership fee gains you access, but they set the hours.  How much clout do you want for $10 a month?

</FONT><HR>I write programs and make a decent living.  Sometimes these types of illegal operations take place, but they are never planned.<P>It seems Verant has now made it acceptable, within their company, to allow a GPF type error to happen.<P>Poor programming allows these to occur.  Sometimes things get by but they are FIXED.  They need to modify the main files to trap that error and simply not present the GPF or the log-in box unless it is appropriate.<P>Let me reiterate.  The GPF type error, once known, MUST be correct by the programmer, regardless of whether a file is missing, not updated, etc, that would eliminate the error.  His programming should be done to trap the error and make it a moot point that the files aren't updated or are missing.  In other words, fix the error now.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>My gripe is not even the server being down. I have 2 complaints now.  <P>#1 They can't get their damn release process right so I spent 2 hours trying to figure out if I could fix their "patch".  I saw the little scheduled downtime for patch notice but their network status page said "all servers are up".  So I figured the patch was done.   A windows application error isn't exactly a clear way of telling the user that your servers are down.  Why in gods name was a partial patch released?  Its  just total incompetence.  <P>#2 I finally wrote in their little QA forum how disatisfied I was with the patch.  I also complained that if their servers were down then the network status page should reflect this. My thread was promtly deleted.  Then one of the admin people here makes a statement saying that there is no bug (laugh, I guess windows app errors aren't bugs to verant), and that we should all wait for servers to come up.  I posted something saying they should have had that on the website.  And the admin tells me to check the website before I flame.  So I go back to the network status page and low and behold, 7 minutes after my first post (2 hours AFTER the servers had gone down) they had finally changed the message.  And u know what I have a right to be mad when a program freezes my computer. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Eranox and anyone else who cares, the actual information that Brad McQuaid and others have posted is that usage is lowest between about 4am and 6:30am Pacific time.<P>If you're going to use that information to determine the best time for a patch, then they should be starting their patch procedure at about 3:30am to 4:30am Pacific time.  That would bring them back online sometime in the early afternoon for the East Coast and even earlier for Central, Mountain, and Pacific time zones.<P>Others here have overstated the case and been too rude about it, but it's probably pretty difficult to get the people required for their present patch procedure to come in at those hours.<P>Experienced sysadmins and server and network managers would recommend to John Smedley to take a thorough review of the patch procedure.  Identify how to do two things.  First, make the procedure more automated with scripts, disk images ready to be copied, swapping prepared hard drives into RAIDs, whatever.  That way, a computer operator or two would be the only ones required on site in the wee hours to update the server.  Second, institute more stringent version controlling.  The kinds of mistakes that have been reported to us by Verant with past patch situations were clearly the result of lack of adequate version controlling.  Provisions should be included to ensure all updates are adequately tested by QA staff, not just developers, also.<P>Most of the developers I've ever known do NOT enjoy having to be somewhere at 7:00 am to do an upgrade or install.  I suspect that current Verant procedures usually end up requiring them there to even begin performing an install.  Automating the install process, and having each new install appropriately tested beforehand, would let those key personnel get some sleep and better able to devote themselves to actual dev work.  It would also let Verant move the install of a new patch to hours that better match the usage patterns of the servers.<P>My dad always said that advice is usually worth about what you pay for it, and that was free advice I just gave.  Still, it's probably worth a lot more than nothing.<P>Thanks for listening(?)<P>-talan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I see the problem with down time as this.  First, it is too often.  Downtime should be scheduled a month in advance and happen only once a month.  Yep, no matter what, a game this complex requires that they have at least a month to test changes.  There is absolutely no need to inconvenience the users every week for sometimes simplistic changes.  In this case the patch message says that some chat channel changes were made.  What good does it do to take the servers down for 6+ hours for some very simplistic changes EVERY week.<P>SMED really needs to take the reigns on the downtime issue.  He needs to dictate a policy of when the servers can be down and for how long.  He should instruct his people on implementing a much more expendient method of updating the server which would only allow the server to be down for a max of 2 hours.  He needs to tell them not to down any other servers until this has been put in place.<P>The game will not have the modified content that we are getting now with each patch but those changes so far have been minor.  I did appreciate the changes to the interface, so that is a positive, but since I'd asked for some of these changes well over a year ago I would have been willing to wait a month longer to get them.<P>SMED doesn't take the control that he needs to take in some instances.  Abashi needs to be taken under his thumb and monitored and this server downtime needs to be addressed immediately.<P>Someone rightly pointed out that the downtime on a particular day usually means that throughout the subsequent 3 or 4 days we have another series of downtimes that bring that 6 to 7 hours up to 10 to 12 hours.  It is usually because of the lack of testing and poor updating process.<P>So, to reiterate.  The downtime is too excessive and shouldn't happen so often and when it does we know we'll have more then the time down that they alotted.  Here's what they should be considering to correct the problem and it should be at the immediate direction of SMED.<P>1)  Downtime should only occur once a month.<P>2)  New policies and practices should be put into place limit the downtime.  Max of 2 hours during any scheduled downtime<P>3)  Downtime should be scheduled a month in advance.<P>4)  The programming should be put into place to ensure that any and all updates can be done and tested within a 2 hour time frame.  They should not allow for any further downtime until they have this put into production.<P>5)  Customers should be reimbursed if the servers are taken down for more then the scheduled time.  If they scheduled for 6 hours and it is down for 12 they need to extend customer subscriptions that much further into the future.<P>Right now I see that Verant isn't providing good customer service.  These few EDICTS put down by SMED could and should stop this from occuring.  It would go a long way to making Verant responsible for their actions.<P>It is not just the downtime that brings out the anger and frustration of the customers.  It is the combination of the issues.  It is the poor customer service, the crummy GM decisions, the class imbalance issues, the downtime, the lack of proper scheduling for downtime, the excessive taking of the servers down to fix a problem caused by the last patch, the failure to list changes, the pitiful customer service provided by Abashi, the nerfs of hard earned items, the moving of guilds from one server to another (not treating all customers the same and equitably), the threats of banning for speaking out on the boards.  I could go on.<P>I think most of the replies to the people in this thread that are to the positive of Verant are seeing the problem of this downtime in isolation.  They aren't seeing the bigger picture.<P>Only those that care come here and voice their complaint.  It does very little good to defend Verant when Verant should be defending themselves and taking action to ensure that the customers are happy.<P>I only need to say one thing.  Taking the servers down every week is excessive.  It is unnecessary.  It should only occur once a month.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>It's a shame that Aaron was reduced to having to use the message boards to get the news out to customers.  And congratulations and thanks to Aaron for a creative and good use of the resource that was available to him.<P>George Scotto, or whoever is in a position to do  something about this....why was there nothing on the Network Status page on the official web site?  Last updates there are about a week old.  More importantly, what can be done to ensure that the news is disseminated quickly and efficiently to everyone in the future when this sort of thing happens?  Might want to make sure that Network Status, Troubleshooting, and Contact Us, all get updated as a priority responsibility of someone involved in installing new patches.  All they need is a few seconds with an HTML-form-driven update page to let us all know via those methods.<P>It took me about ten minutes of speed dialing the tech support number repeatedly to get through on the EQ tech support line.  That was to even get as far as being on hold without being dropped first.  I did then get through to a rep after only a few minutes.  The problem was that the entire call center was swamped with requests for help on today's botched patch, and the web site didn't have any information on it to forestall people from calling in.<P>I'm sad to note this is only the latest instance of Verant costing themselves money, resources and a whole lot of frustrated even angry customers.  I know it's far from intentional, but it doesn't help when this is almost an expected pattern nowadays.<P>:-&lt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>For those people whose lives revolve around EQ to the point that downtime is so traumatic, I suggest finding another hobby, or perhaps professional help.  First of all, the downtime schedule makes sense to most people, at least in the US.  Most people, regardless of timezone, are at work or getting ready for work in the timezones further east.  And while it's been several years since I experienced "summer vacation", those people who aren't working are probably sleeping in.  Most of the people I know get most of their playing in from 8PM-2AM, so the downtime isn't a huge factor. I can appreciate the annoyance of those people who only get to play a few hours each week, but everyone who sits in front of the PC playing EQ each and every day really should consider finding something else to pass the time other than complaining!  Heck, I wouldn't even know that the servers were down if not for the fact that I'm home sick today.<P>Working in a technology administration job, I know how much people hate downtime.  But it is a necessary evil, both for the admins and the end users.  And even in Verant sent each and every player an email telling them about the scheduled patch day and resulting downtime, a lot of people (myself included) wouldn't see it since the first thing they do is fire up EQ.  A reminder in the patch message would have been good, but again, many people don't read through that either.<P>Go paint a picture or write a novel if all this time is too much for you!  Or take a nap...maybe you'll be over it when you wake up.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Downtime is a policy issue.  IT is a practice.  It is an issue of customer service.  IT has nothing to do with *****ing or moaning.  It only shows whether a company listens to its customers or not.  IT shows how responsive they are to customer needs.<P>It does not have to do with whether someone's life revolves around the game.  IT never has.  <P>I worked for a company that produce a web based search (for attorney's and accountants) on every piece of known tax law and information.  Anytime the servers were down, for any reason, even scheduled people informed us that they were paying for a service.  There are companies that recognize this far more then you or Verant ever could.  Many companies would find this unacceptable practice and would demand a policy change.  Stop trying to insult those that are trying to get a better more stable game.  It is their practice of taking down the servers that cause the instability over the subsequent few days.  If they would do this once a month then we'd have 1/4 the downtime we have now.  That is an improvement and Verant has a problem making sure that they focus on all aspect of customer service.<P>It was my job to ensure that these people's concerns were addressed.  Our department spent many endless hours ensuring that the service was up 24/7.  That is what our customers paid for anyway.  They didn't just pay for it at work, they paid for it any time of the day any day of the week, any night and every day and night.<P>The problem we have is the continuously problemmatic problems in getting Verant to understand their responsibilities to their customer base.  It should all be done without any input from the customers.  IT is a customer service issue after all.<P>Stop saying that people are in-fighting here.  People here are fighting for what you don't have the guts to fight for yourselves.  They deserve praise for doing this fighting and not the condemnation you place on them.  It is the unwise that will condemn people for figthing for the betterment of the service (not just some shaman shield, or brighter blue for messages, etc).<P>The difference between them and you is that they want to see light at the end of the tunnel, they want to see an end to entropy, and you are happy to remain blind to even the minimalistic sense of improved customer service and satisifying the demands of the customer.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR><BR>In further news, users visiting another popular ISV's home page have discovered:<P>"...an authenticode-signed ActiveX control imbedded on the web page which will proceed to delete all .sys, .exe, and .dll files in the windows and windows\system directory upon the user's next system restart, then crash the system.  This is expected and normal behavior for the time being, it is supposed to happen, and will more than likely be fixed by the time you reinstall your operating system.   You are free to visit other sites in the meantime however, we aren't stopping you.
