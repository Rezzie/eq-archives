</FONT><HR>Here is a little background, I am a Tier`Dal warrior and I worship Innorruk. <P>1. Taunt really does need some tweaking its extremely difficult to taunt any post 50 mobs off of a rogue, monk, or ranger.<P>2. Increase bind wounds a bit, I am pretty sure mine maxed out around 100 or so.<P>3. Disarm is pretty much worthless to a degree even when it does work no matter what your skill is in it. I have it maxed post 50 and takes me about 20 tries to disarm a decaying skeleton.<P>4. I would love to see racial melee abbilities, say for example: a barbarian can head-butt, a halfling can perform a low blow.<P>5. Along the lines of racial abbilites maybe change the flavor of all the hidden attributes. For example: speed. An ogre warrior should maybe hit a lil bit harder and absorb more damage. I on the other hand should hit faster and more accurately I do have 99 INT afterall.<P>6. I do not notice critical hits as much as when I did when I was lower level, the same with crippling blows.<P>7. This really has nothing to do with warriors but its very unfair being KOS on my own god's plane and him directly. It is not fair that Tunare and Bristlebane followers can quest on thier respected diety's planes and walk around untouched. Also, what makes Tunare higher level then Innorruk anyways. I think all the planes need to be tweaked and have quests and faction for thier respected followers.<P>my .02</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would say some heavy nurfing for warriors is in order. Seriously, they are not casters, nor are they hybrids but their armor has effects that give them access to most of the best spells hybrids have like invisibility.  Shoot even hybrids cant shrink themselves.  I would say remove these spell effects from their armor or give all hybrids melee/tanking abilities near par with warriors.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi Allan<P>I have got to say I love my Ogre Warrior. I think I am very valuable to whatever group I join. Its also a great deal of fun looking down on your pray and pummeling them to death.  That being said.. I only have a few small issues that I think would make warriors a little bit more enjoyable.<P>CRITICALS<BR>They are a joke. The other day I was recording my Crits and I found that only 1 in 10 were doing more damage than a regular hit. They should do more damage and or have a stun or knockback effect added to them.  Its sad to see in a fight "You have scored a critical hit (18)!" Then 2 seconds later.. "The rouge has backstabbed (130)". <P>2Handers<BR>They need something.. im not sure what. But as it stands I have no desire to use one, the delay mixed with terrible taunt dont make them worth while.  Perhaps a special 2hand skill that allows an AE damage (like swining the blade around you) would make carrying a 2hander more worth while.<P>Taunt<BR>Its been said enough.. we need to taunt better<P>Most importantly..<BR>Skills between 25-50. <BR>Disarm is useless (majority of players are not PVP where disarm is most effective). Every other class has something to look forward to every few levels, be it another skill, type of attack, spell.. whatever.  Once I hit 25 I was depressed because I knew there was going to be such a long haul without anything new to entertain me.  Could we see some kind of skills, like activatable attacks perhaps added between 30 and 50?  Someone suggested a Pin idea or a massive damage blow and that would be great. As an ogre.. I'd love to see him be able to wind up and nail something for all hes worth in a one shot attempt.  Maybe have it so that it drains half your stamina to use it but does like a quad damage hit. That would work really well with 2 handers. <P>But, if i didnt see any changes, I wouldnt be terribly upset. I love my warrior. We are the standard. Everyone compares to us to judge themselves.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>AC is all we need. Remember when we heard there were 25 AC gauntlets and boots dropping in Karnors? Hell yea I was there religiously for 5 months before I got both pieces. Then I heard Sebilis had arms, bracers, and helms. 5 months later at an even faster pace and I still haven't obtained one piece. Make it no drop if you have to but I think I have seen enough zols and shrooms to wear this armor. Not so many reets so I can't comment on those drops. We don't want spells, we don't want effects, we want AC. Maybe some war only high ac items too. Remember how many more warriors are in the game compared to other tank types. Give them skills if you must but give us AC!<BR>Sonan 55 warrior, Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>After reading all of the posts I am discouraged to see that no lower level Warriors have a voice. I started with an Enchanter and found it was taking far too long to level and when needing daggers for my pet spells entailed me traveling to Erudin (I was human) I decided to start a warrior.<BR>I am impressed with the class but very discouraged with alot of different aspects. I have been able to solo at times but when I do get hit it is pretty much determined that I am going to die and have to run for 30 minutes to recover my corpse ... if I can even find it ! Bind would be very nice when you are running across the continent to level.<BR>It has already been said that healing is horrible. I was with a group in the oasis yesterday and they eventually disbanded from me because it was taking far too long to heal. Here I am the tank of the group and I am sitting on my butt while our casters mana has fully regenerated and they are ready to fight.<BR>Taunt is a given. Even at a low level it does not work properly.<P>I think asking for lower level response is important because you start to get discouraged and not continue the character, especially when you see there are no real advantages to being a warrior after level 20 or so ... we lowly ones count too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, didn't read all the other posts, but I'll say a few things.<P>Bind wound/regen is nice, but not absolutely needed I don't think.<P>Taunt DEFINITELY needs upgraded, so many other classes can out taunt me if they use a certain weapon or spell combo.  Epic kinda fixes that, but Epic isn't exactly available to every warrior out there.  The majority don't benefit from the epic.<P>As for damage output for warriors? Who cares, warriors arn't here to do damage, they are here to take it.  So, how about upping AC/HP?  If not AC, at least HP.  Most paladins I know have more HP/AC then me with their self buffs.  Stupid IMO, and by using stuns they can out taunt me.<P>As for the epic?  Don't change the quest, but I still feel 24 delay on our epic is a bit too much.  Doubt that will be changed however, but I'll mention it still.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Anyways, for the most part I say just fix our taunt, and give us some more AC/HP to tank with please! thankyou! buh bye now</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>When in a group, i think warriors are pretty well balanced except for a few things that have already been said here. Well since hybrids got new disciplines, they became just as useful as us in some raids where disciplines are very important.<BR>I mainly wanted to point out that warriors are the worst class possible when they are not in a group. No way to travel alone, no way to heal, no way to bind, no way to invis, no way to fd, no way to solo even greens, no way to escape or gate... Basically, a warrior needs a group even to travel.<BR>Now i could understand if warriors were also the most useful class in a group.<BR>They aren't.<BR>Clerics and enchanters are. And both of those classes don't suffer all the downsides a warrior has.<P>My point is: with so many downsides, warriors should be more important to a group. Now that would make other tank classes useless... So what ? Reduces our downsides. Make a discipline to run faster for example. Just a way to travel easier or to escape the damn blue mob that aggroed in the middle of the zone and that will kill you because you are such a bad soloer and runner.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I really only have 4 conserns with the warrior class.<P>1) HP.  We don't have spells, Lay of Hands, Harmstouch, Fein Death, Instill Doubt or backstab.  So why do most of the hybrids and other Melee classes have about 85% of the hp we do.  I think we need more hp, we tank, we have to be able to take a beating.  I really think Warriors need around a 20% increase in HP.<P>2) Taunt.  I can not taunt a mob off a monk with decent weapons.  It's plain impossible, unless the monk feins or backs up, but then as soon as he starts attacking again, the mob aggros back on him.<P>3)Bind Wound.  Cap of 100 till lvl 50?  Come on, Bind would is very important to melee classes.  I don't really want to see warriors able to bind wound up to 75%, but I'd like to see the bind wound skill go up to at least 175 before being capped till lvl 50, then go up to 225 or so.<P>4) AC.  We need more ac as well.  Like with HP, I've seen other classes with AC the same, if not higher then mine at the same lvl as me.  I can understand monks, because of how agile the are, but paladins and shadow knights?<P>I'd just like to end by saying warriors have Attack, Kick, Taunt and Slam (if your a big race).  We have no spells.  We are tanks.  We need Lots of HP and high AC.  we need to be able to taunt a mob off a monk.  Well I'm rambling late at night.

</FONT><HR>Hello,  I am glad to see a discussion on warriors.  I love the class I play, an see very little wrong with it. Only two things I see that needs improvment.<P>1. Taunt, prior to 50 I did not have much trouble with it. Now at 56 I see more an more where I have to be able to get the Mob off my group members. They only hit harder an more often at this level.  A caster slowing can be in serious trouble for example.<P>2. Drop rate on cobalt is insane for the bracer an helm.  We are what we wear, our AC an HP is why we can tank.  The effect on the guantlets is a joke. I have only used it on others to prove why I dont use it.  Any low level buff would do fine maybe even a charisma buff for selling.<P>Thank you for your time an hope you read this.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have one thing to say about warriors that is that we need more Hit points i have seen mobs in burning woods hit for well into the 300s with doubles we can take that for two long and if the cleric fizzles well it sucks to be us.  I know that we are made to fight and die but sometimes the amount of times we die is way more than it should be.  With more hps we would still die but not quite as offten.<P>Aesir Odinsblade <BR>Warrior of the 50 seasons<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I say let stamina the stat mean more after hp for hp and more hp per level. <P>That is all.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>54th level Warrior here, Fennin Ro<P>1) Epic weapon item drop rates... the red and green dragon scales, the ball of golem metal from Fear, the Hand of Maestro, The blade from the Chardok Queen, the block of permafrost ice, the blade from the spiroc lord... all are incredibly too rare or uncommon.  With this many difficult mobs to kill for our epic, the items needed should be dropping every time.<P>2) Taunt... it is almost impossible to taunt off of monks, rangers and rogues when they are outdamaging us by a good margin.  Its also hard to taunt off of certain casters when they cast high aggro spells.  I can understand the need for those spells to attract the mobs.. but a warrior should be able to re-attract that mob with 2 or 3 good taunts provided the caster doesnt keep casting (over-burning).<P>3) Small and medium race warriors are very ineffective compared to large class warriors.  The penalty of not being able to get into small places is nothing when you look at the advantages of regeneration, not getting stunned from the front, slam and incredible strength and stamina scores.  Playing a human warrior, I have been described as "fragile" in comparison to my troll and ogre comrades.  I think dodge, parry and defensive skills need to be looked at to take into account size of the race and agility or dexterity more than they do now<P>Thanks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Armor that normal people can get with out needing an army to get it , more hps, and something to make the class fun (like bard/rog illuisons or anything to bring alil comedy to the game for the warriors to have fun with.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The monsters plain do OUTRAGEOUS damage, and that was a bad choice to make the game difficult. Hence the popularity of kiting that negates this factor. Could a different way be found to balance out the difficulty, that makes it fair for classes that MUST fight toe to toe and the kiters?<BR>Until something is done to fix this, I will play my druid, as many others have.<BR>Quit under-rating the ability to solo, you blow it off as nothing. Well it is HUGE, and should be penalized. I don't group often because:<BR>1. the proper mixes of classes aren't available (because you have underestimated the solo ability mainly, 60% druid population is the result on some servers).<BR>2. no one desires to group in the area, it is not fair to expect me to wait hours to find a group.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1.  Taunt- We are supposed to tank let us tank.  How about a item, maybe gotten from a quest.  Warrior only right clickable buff, that makes us proc a taunt spell?  No damage, no effect other then it gets the mob on us and not on the ranger, monk, rogue.  <P>2.  Balanced armor for all races or up the 255 max stat cap.  All good warrior armor gives str.  Because of this non large races easily max str.  Large races have a hard time finding agility and dex items to balance thier stats without losing a ton of ac.  <P>3. Increase taunt.<P>4. Let the warrior epic pieces drop in some of the new zones as well as the old ones.  Noone wants to go back and fight in fear and hate when we did it 200 times last year.  And noone wants to step on the toes of the level 46 to 52's that fight those planes currently.  Put in NEW mobs for this quest so the competition is with others trying to get a epic not someone trying to kill a god for the first time.<P>5.

</FONT><HR>Aha!  What Edone wrote above reminded me of something I've been thinking about for a while, and totally forgot until now.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I remember when Crafted Armor was AWESOME.  It was the first great class specific quested armor.  It was a defining thing for warriors to be decked out in blue.  But I always felt that the whole crafted thing was not finished.  Where's the crafted mask? Where's the crafted cape, girdle, and collar? How about a crafted shield? (Ew!)<P>So, here's the idea: make a new set of crafted quests for the "missing pieces."  It would be easy and simple to do, just have the dwarf smiths who do resizing also offer to make the newer pieces. Make the quests doable by people in their mid to high thirties, and make the pieces like the original crafted was, really nice stuff!<P>But wait!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  There has to be some balance issues here, and that's why I was reminded by the post above about this idea.  Warriors are arguably the most equipment-dependant class in the game.  There are currently very few "item sinks" in Everquest, and anybody who fails to see THAT as a problem is probably playing on a new server.  Anybody remember when the Lanseax of the Wolves was a good two-hander?  Every LoW that was ever gotten is still floating around in game somewhere, except when people have gotten tired of the game and deleted a character with all stuff on it.  <P>So, here's the idea.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Make the suit of crafted complete, so the class-defining armor is there in full.  Then, have the dwarves offer an upgrade path.  You have to do a quest quite a bit harder than the original quest, (but still doable by mid to high 40's) which entails a goodly bit of cash, a couple of items from reasonably zesty mobs, and two or more items to turn in, including the original piece of crafted.  <P>For example, you want to upgrade a crafted bracer to the next level, you have to find the next smith, then turn in the crafted bracer, a thousand plat, an old Bone Bladed Claymore, a nice gem, and some mob drop, like say a tottering gorilla arm or something.  You get back a nice bracer, call it a Forged Bracer or something. Give it like half again the AC and double the stats of Crafted, make it some cool color.  <P>This helps Warriors do what we like, which is soak up the hits, and it helps the whole game by sopping up some items and cash. If VI decides they need to get rid of different items, they just change the quests so they require different items.<P>Just a random idea, that kinda sorta fits the thread!   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Okay, i am not sure if this is already mentioned, but here i go anyways.<P>Bind Wound, this skill is capped at 100 (for Troll Warriors, but i thought it was for all warriors). This actually makes it useless after about level 20 for trolls, probably 30 for other non-regen races.<P>Could this skill get a cap that is a bit higher so we can do some downtime healing ourselfs (although not very much, but doing 10 bandages at skill 200 would mean 500hp restored (each bandages takes about 10 seconds to apply)). Now this does sound a little unbalancing, but realise that at level 50-60 the cap is increased anyways and at 200 skill (level 40) 500hp is not that much, but it does make the burden on the healers a bit less.<P>For the rest i must say i like the warrior a lot better then i expected (just started it to see if it really s*cked like everyone said at that time)<P>Bazzek, Level 31 Troll Warrior, House of Pendragon (Innoruuk)<BR>Galaden, Level 20 Barbarian Shaman, House of Pendragon (Innoruuk)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>i agree with the taunt issue it is needed to be improved. as far a balance issue,without starting a huge fight over a warrior role i.e. meatsheild for group. i believe a warrior should be able to solo anything a druid that is 15 lower can solo. for example a hill giant. im lvl 48 and still get whooped everytime nomatter what i try. yet lvl 30 druid can solo one..how is this balanced? perhaps allowing a warrior to wear a blade in there boot will even the odds a bit. no delay on the blade or spikes let kick skill be the delay.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Ogres can't be stunned from the front and trolls regen.<P>Maybe a little somethign for the little guys that make them useful.  Maybe giant, large sized Mobs have a slightly higher miss % on the little guys. <P>It shouldn't be anything big.

Raise the skill, make it stick on a mob like a dot...do whatever, just make it better. <P>Second, Epic weapon. I have had mine for months, I know of what I speak. Damage delay is sub par. Especially now that 13 dmg, 20 dly weapons are turning up. Lots of weapons outshine the Blade of Strategy. <P>The Blade of Tactics and the Jagged Blade of War are fine, the Blade of Strategy needs help though. <P>Sure, it has nice stats, adds a good number of hit points. But it doesn't help me do my job...in fact, it hurts. It taunts poorly. <P>I realize the proc is supposed to make up for this. And it does...WHEN THE PROC IS NOT RESISTED. <P>WAY too many mobs in Velious, Veeshan's Peak and elsewhere, just completely blow off the proc, because they are immune to it. <P>Make the Blade of Strategy 13 dmg, 20 dly, and make the proc unresistable...then we are golden, problem solved. <P>Arnwolf Magnuson<BR>Da`Kor<BR>58th Barbarian Warrior<BR>Erollisi Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>The concerns of the warrior class seem to be fairly well represented here.<P>I just wanted to to wiegh in behind a few of the ideas.<P>1) Taunt-  As a 55 war, I am frequently getting to watch the monk with cf in my group out tank me.  He is upset about it, I am upset about it,  the chorus of "Taunt, Damn It!" is deafening.  I even replaced my keyboard, in case it was just a faulty taunting key, but alas, the issue seems to reside elsewhere.  Let the banners and protest signs not fly! Save My Monk!!  Just let me be hated a bit more...<P>2) Piercing Skill Cap-  Warriors are master of weapons, except daggers.  Then, they are just pretty good.  Rogues will not lose thier standing with bring the poker cap up to standard with all the rest.  VI has done a great job of making Rogues a more wanted class in groups.  This would be a nice balance fix.<P>3) Hitpoints-  It almost seems unreal to be asking for more, but...  This is the staple of the warrior class.  The discs are nice toys, ac cap is attainable, but it is hp that really set the mark out there.  <P><BR>4) Nice naming convention  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  I love to wait to get to 55 to be an unquestioning follower.<P>Overall, nice work-<P>Gus<P>55 War, TT<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

If an exploit is feared, just make it not castable on pets, though pets need help taunting too.<P>Just an Idea I thought I would throw out.<P>BTW, people quite complaining about spell effects on weapons and armor.  None of the really usefull stuff is exactly easy to come by, and if it comes off of a Dragon/God/Ubermob that takes 30 or 40 of your best friends to kill for just a couple of loot items, it deserves to give an ablility not already possesed by the class.  my number 1 loot complaint is that nothing usefull is obtainable at the level where it would be usefull, if anything, I would love to see some decent loot moved to something casually killable if we are going to consider Gear a Balance issue and not a content issue.  <P>And, just in my opinion, but the Game is called Everquest. All of the best gear should come from quests, not be droped by ubermobs.<P><BR>My 2cp, don't spend it all at once<BR>---Necridious Darkheart, one of the few, the proud, Erudite Necromancer.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have to concur.<P>-Warriors are the masters of taking damage; yet, post 50, it's very hard for us to taunt off any melee class normally doing their job. Taunt does needs to be fixed.<P>-Epic weapon? Not really. It really does need to be fixed. I think it was messed up that, as many warriors were receiving their epics, there were better weapons being found in Velious. Yes, I hear the point that if the warrior epic was better than everything in Velious, no one would go after the weapons in Velious. But know that most warriors do not have their epics and will go after the weapons in Velious.<P>Lower the ratio on both of the weapons to say, 12/19. That would help quite a bit. I also suggest scaling the monk epic weapon to do the same damage over time but to reduce taunt. Celestial Fists are nearly impossible to taunt off of.<P>-Making shields back slot equippable for warriors - very nice. Very nice indeed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Greetings fellow warriors.<P>What I would like to see, is an increase in taunt effect, thats why the skill is, isn't it, to taunt? Why should we HAVE to insert insane amount of money to get uber weapons to be able to save our weaker companions from the claws of the monster. Please, look at it. I think everyone in the game would backup the taunt effectiveness.<P>Other thing I would like to see is more significant role for the usage of SHIELD. This, acctually, would please SKs and Paladins even more I bet, but kind of silly if the shield has such a minor effect. Using a shield shoud either a) Give huge amount of AC b) Give stat/skill points to parrying/defense c) make you parry/defense increase by the amount you 'invest' in the skill with a percentage, so you could give parry % and it would put % much weight in your parry/defense skill and it would of course decrease your attacking abilities. Yes, a bit like the disciplines. <P>I really would like to see taunting warriors, with shields, who really act and are the defenders of the group like they are supposed to be. I for one wouldnt mind losing some attack capabilities for being a better 'tank'.<P>Thank you, drive through.<BR>Tguk <BR>lvl 45 Warrior</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>i play a 57 warrior, and here is what i think should be done to our class<P>1) &lt;&lt;taunting!&gt;&gt;<BR>by far and wide, like everyone has said, INCREASE taunting effectivness post 50!! the upgrade to taunt recently has helped, but its really not enough. monks rangers and rogues continue to get hammered cause taunt doesnt work. make taunt have a chance to work on mobs above our lvl. lower the chance the higher the mob is, but still let us have a shot at drawing that uber mob to us.<P>the AoE taunt also is a great idea. and would be very risky to use and have to be timed well with the healers. i dont know how this could be implemented tho, it would most likely require a new skill.<P>2)critical/cripple hits:<BR>it simply doesnt make sense to get critials/cripples for less then a normal hit. the dmg from a crit should always be higher then the max normal hit you can do with a weapon. and cripples should be more then the maxiumum you can do with a critical. this isnt overpowering, crits/crips are not very common even in long fights. it removes the "eyecandy' effect and makes them have some sort of use.<P>3)disciplines:<BR>reduce the refresh time on the ones that are over 30minutes. or keep indepandant timers from each discpline. as it stands now many disc's just never get used because the refresh is too long. why use mightystrike and do a bit more dmg  for 10 seconds have a huge refresh then using defensive and tanking gloriously for 3minutes with a short refresh. doesnt make alot of sense. make them all desirable.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The issues that I see are these:<P>1) Taunt:<BR>It's better than it was, but if it could be increased then great. I very often have situations where I'll taunt, mob will turn onto me for a nano second before turning back onto the player that's getting the beatdown. This only happens on 50+ level mobs. My suggestion would be to alter Taunt, say from 55 upwards, so that it adds enough pseudo damage to keep the mob on the warrior until taunt refreshes. This would get countered by the fact that taunt fails every so often. By all means set the raid encounters to be untauntable, but for day to day grouping, the warrior should be able to keep the mob on them for the majority of the battle.<P>2) Taunt again:<BR>Give us a new discipline that allows us to AE Taunt. One minute duration, an hour refresh or something. Usable as a last ditch save the battle discipline. For that minute, each taunt acts as an AE taunt. <P>3) Rampage and Flurry:<BR>Ok, this is a wishlist but I'd love to be able to have these disciplines, maybe Flurry at 58 and Rampage at 60. Make them work off the stamina bar in addition to duration/reuse timers. If the warrior is out of exhausted, they won't have the stamina to perform such an action. This would prevent them being used at the end of a long fight without stamina management (invigor line).<P>4) Epic:<BR>The warrior epic is the only pure melee epic without Haste. Why is this? I can live with the dmg/dly ratio but not every warrior has dragon haste or better. I am two items away from my epic (Maestro's Hand which has eluded me 10 times now, and the Queen's Blade) yet I do not have dragon level Haste.<P>5) Hitpoints regen:<BR>Would it be too much to double the warrior's hps regen if they are sitting? It takes a long time to heal up after bouncing along Dreadlands if you don't have a regen BP of some sort, and even then it takes a while.<P>6) Epic again:<BR>Maestro's Hand is too rare. I have had the pleasure of seeing 10 Handless Maestro's in a row and have no reason to go back to Hate other than this Hand.

</FONT><HR>Well I been playin a warrior for a long time and the biggest problem I got, well the two biggest problem is a)I got nothin to do during battle cept sit back and watch my character swing at my opponent &lt;with occasionally pressing kick and taunt&gt; and b)its a really boring class with nothin to look forward to in higher levels cept 50+ I mean casters get spells and skill every 4 to 6 levels and monks are always gettin new skills to use in combat, heck rogues get to make and use poisons for combat and have to keep movin to get in a better position to hit. so here is my 2cp in a kindly formated list  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>1.) give us more to do in combat like an attempt at holding a mob from attacking for a few rounds or knockin the thing on the floor for a few ticks<P>2.) give us new skill in between lvls 35 and 50 heck even disc's would work  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> just give us somethin to make us WANT to get those higher levels<P>3.) heh last thing is as a warrior in EQ i've found myself to become a weapons collector and its not to keep my skills up. its cause I want soemthin to do during combat so every so often I think I'll play with my mithril staff or pull out my painbringer and shield of the slain just to give a break in the monotony of being a warrior<P>&gt;&gt;inspiration&lt;&lt;<BR>How bout somethin to make us better pullers since that seems to be the only thin warriors can do other then stand there and swing at the Mobs<P>heh ok Rant over  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Greetings again,<P>I would love Zentaers idea about dualwielding 2h weapons, but I guess this if one of those 'never gonna happen' things. Well first of all it couldnt be just for big races (though i'm an ogre myself), beucase of the unbalancing things and whines from others. <P>But if this somehow could be implemented, that would make 2h weapons (as cool as they are) again wanted and used. I'm silly and for emotional reasons and for looks often tend to use 2h weapons, thats what big warriors were born for, I think. But again, the taunting...<P>AAAAND SHIELDS. Please take a look at the previous post I made, propably on this same page 5.<P>And yes, I agree with those who state that warriors dont have too much to do, just attack and push that underpowered taunt button. Give us more buttons, preferably somewhere between 15-50 because there so little to gain in that span anyway.<P>That's all folks,<BR>Tguk<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The only real Problem i see with Warriors right now is the Iksar Warrior severe lack of higher level armor.  Our Trooper Scale Mid level quest armor is fantastic, but we have nothing to look forward to in the planes since we can't wear indo, and once again we Can't wear Cobalt either.  Not asking for a new set in both cases, but some new set armor before the Super high level Velious zones would be nice.  Kinda Strange that the only race that can start in Kunark has no high level Kunark class set armor.  Playing an Iksar warrior can be very discouraging when you realize you're not gonna be able to have a new set of class armor for another 35 levels, and even then you're gonna have to be in a very very powerful guild who doesn't care about faction.  I would love to see an alternate to Indo or Cobalt, same color chain armor with 4 less ac per peice would fit perfectly because of Iksar's Natural ac boost.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have a lvl 55 warrior and all in all i am completely happy.<P>Do have a couple of thoughts though;<P>Disarm;<BR>Only good for additional taunting (if it even does that) otherwise a totally pointless skill. Hardly ever works and even when it does, it makes no difference at all.<BR>Once you hit certain zones like seb, nothing has FS weapons anyways, and special drops cant be disarmed...<P>Bind wound;<BR>Honestly, 30+ lvls where this skill doesnt increase at all seems rather pointless. At lvl 20 it caps at 100 (25hps a bind, fine at that lvl). By lvl 50 it still does 25hps, but now 50% health is around 1k hps... bandaging 700hps after a bad fight (28 bandages) is impractical. 70% heal should stay as is, however increasing the cap to around 175 at lvl 40-50 (45 hps a bind) would be reasonable, and i wouldnt need to carry 12 stacks of bandages if i want to camp a greenie for a quest drop...<P>Taunt;<BR>The times i have fought mobs lvl 55+ are very few and far between, so i cant really comment on that, but basically anything blue to me i have NO problem taunting off other group members most of the time. Most of it is dependant on the rest of the group. If i am not pulling, that makes taunting off the puller hard and if the shaman slows too early or the cleric has to CH early in the fight obiviously its hard to taunt off, but thats as it should be. I can out taunt most rogues, pretty much every monk and casters who know their job is not usually hard.<P>However, i do like the idea of taunt disciplines. An AE taunt would be extremely useful, and one to increase the agro or reduce the refresh (although clicking on taunt every 2 seconds could get annoying) of taunt would help.<P>But apart from possible disciplines as far as im concerned, there should be NO CHANGE TO TAUNT whatsoever.<P>Kalanaf<BR>55 Myrmidon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I play a barbarian warrior on Rallos Zek, warriors are pretty balanced in the game, but could use maybe some tweeking with a few issues. First off, wars are supposed to be the main tank, but I have found that Paladins, can rival our ac with their buffs, I think we should get an ac buff for being able to fight better in full armor, that would increase our ac slighly. Entrenching our roal as best ac. Also taunt doesnt seem to work well at high levels, this should be fixed since its our main purpose. I really liked the suggestion of a slow reusable AOE slash with 2h weapons, I think thats neat and a very valid warrior skill. A BIG issure is that without a group or sow we basically cant run though a zone without being killed if we are aggroed, especially in kunark and vellious where all the mobs run so damn fast... I know you wont and shouldnt give warriors some kind of invis or speed effect, but they are the only ones with nothing to help them travel. I really liked the idea of a HUGE cycle reusable discipling or skill that calls to your god and binds your soul, like 24hrs or something, I think this is a good idea and wouldnt effect balancing issues... At the very least how about increasing our places where we can bind =), also relatively speaking to other classes and the new expansion weapons, I think its kinda dumb that our epic is crappy... I talked to a level 60 warrior about it, I'm 48, and he said he almost has it, its taken him a real long time bc its so hard, and its only going to be for show since he already has better weapons... that broke my heart =(... To sum up... more bind points, or maybe bind yourself with high recycle time, and better taunt and ac... let us do what we were made to do =)<BR>Chaunie 48 warrior Vallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Or you could just bring your CF wielding monk friend to just about any plane and try to taunt off him. Ofcourse, your Karnor fighting self wouldnt do that..<P>As i said before, when im the ONLY one whos unharmed after a fight, there is something wrong! A level 60 warrior, no matter race, stats, haste and weapons should ALWAYS have a solid chance to aggro the mob so bad they dont wanna beat down said warriors friends.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>In well over a year as a Warrior a few things have stuck in my mind.  I'll just make a list for easier reading.<P>1) Taunt:  I'm a warrior. I'm supposed to take the hits, it's what I am born to do.  With a rogue or monk in group with decent weapons, it is hard to out-taunt them due to their low delay and high haste respectively.  When the healer is spening more mana on a monk than on me something is very wrong.  A monk is not a tank, a rogue is not a tank, a Warrior is a Tank.  A more effective taunt would be greatly appreciated by all warriors, and many clerics.<P>2) Critical Hits/Crippling Blows: When I first saw that wonderful message that I had scored a critical hit, I was ecstatic.  It is a great idea.  The only problem I see is this, the average critical hit is no better than a decent normal attack.  When I see a slew of critical hits no better than my normal attacks I want to throw down my weapon and walk away.  This is supposed to be a well placed and crushing blow to the enemy, not a slap in the face to the Warrior.  Perhaps adding a damage base equal to the max damage of a normal attack would be the way to go.  The hit is not critical if it is no better than a randomly placed strike.  Crippling blows follow this.  What exactly is a crippling blow that is less than the average attack?  It's a crippling blow to the Warrior who has to tolerate the snickers of the hybrids, monks, and rogues.  "Hey nice crit/crip! Way to stick it to 'em"......"/growl".<P>3) AC:  Warriors were meant to be the damage absorbers in the game.  That's difficult when the average melee has AC equal to your own with similar equipment for the level.  Perhaps increasing the base AC of the warrior would return them to that role.  No need to change warrior armor, just the heart of the tank.<P>4) Defensive skills:  Why is it that a Warrior with close to double the HP of most other melee dies just as fast?  Our defensive skills are not up to par.  Warriors get hit.  This is our job, but we can't compete with the classes who have less hp, but get hit less often.  Dodge/parry/riposte should have higher caps at lower levels, and should max at the highest possible.  This is what we do. We stand in teh way. We can't backstab, we can't toss mana, we can't feign death.  We stand in the way of a mob and hope we live longer than it does.  We have nothing else.<P>5) Two-Handed weapons:  Using a Lamentation at 9 damage, I can hit between 50-60 on a good hit.  Using a Felhammer at 34 damage I can manage 160-170 on a good hit.  Felhammer is 3.7x the damage of a Lamentation.  The damage output is 2.8x of a Lamentation in raw damage per hit, without considering duel weild.  This was looked into previously, and the damage was raised, but was it raised enough?<P>6) Large Race vs Small:  The larger races have the ability to Slam, stunning the target, and interrupting spells.  This is because of the size of the race, they are just huge.  But also, because of their size, could it not be assumed they would also be hit more?  I am not saying decrease the defensive skills of the large races, but I am saying an extra skill should be given to warriors of the particularly small races.  A natural tendency to avoid hits, due to the diminutive stature.  Naturally it would be more difficult to hit a gnome compared to ogre; it's like hitting the bulls-eye versus the wall the board is hung on.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Good thing: Warriors have the highest AC by a good margin compared to the other classes (assuming comparable equipment)<BR>They are followed by rogues, then monks or tank hybrids (SK, paladin) and clerics/rangers. <BR>The idea of a round sweep disc at mid to higher lvls is nice I think, its the AE taunt some people have requested.<P>BAd thing: The total necessity of the defensive discipline. This one ability has changed the role of tanks, eventually making the warrior the only tank for serious fight.... other tank classes cannot even work as backups. I dont think its a good idea to have mobs hit for so much damage that this disc is absolutely necessary, and that others without that disc cannot even dare to tank them for a few rounds. Suggestion? Give scaled down defensive discs to other classes, or lower the incredibly high damage values of some mobs, making the defensive disc not necessary... I mean, it becomes boring if you cannot use any disc on a raid at all, cause you HAVE to use defensive.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
