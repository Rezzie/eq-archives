</FONT><HR>As one of the few Dark Elves ever to take up the Smithing hammer, and as one of the TRULY rare Dark Elven Warriors ever to choose the profession, I officially inform you, Yakatizma, that you have suffered the final indignity upon the smiths of my race.<P>When I learned that only followers of Innoruk could ever hope to see magically enhanced Tier'Dal racial armor, I was saddened (seeing my fellow followers of Rallos Zek left behind), but I grudgingly accepted that Rallos would ignore his stepchildren.<P>When I learned that the quality of our finest Cultural Plate Mail was barely a fraction of the money and time put into its creation, I perservered, creating the only three pieces I have ever seen actually USED on my server, and have worn them with pride since that day.<P>When I learned that the Plate Mail we forged could POSSIBLY be Enchanted (and perhaps even be Imbued, maybe, MAYBE even for followers of Rallos), but that the Gods had not put the final piece of the puzzle into the chain (enchanted chain jointing now works, but making of folded sheets fails), I had still held out some infintesmally small hope that someday we might wear our armor with pride.<P>As of today, the final speck of those hopes has been dashed.<P>The rarest and most key ingredient to the art of enchanting Tier'Dal Platemail, the Blue Diamond, long expensive yet obtainable (with the vendors of Norrath offering only 250 for them, players would, on occasion, grant us poor smiths their excess diamonds for a mere 250-300), has now been added to the long-standing trade of Jewelcraft.<P>Not only added, but it can be made into what is arguably some of the absolutely best, and most versatile gear, in existence in Norrath.  I logged in this day to discover that my Guild (long the only possible source for Blue Diamonds for the craft) was now hoarding them to make resistance jewelry for Guild Raids.<P>This final insult is intolerable.  You have made it clear to the few Dark Elven master-smiths that we were never meant for the forge, and that our attempts are futile at best.  Never again shall I take the hammer to the mystical metal of Adamantite.  Were it not for the fact that the Adamantite I now wear will not burn in the cultural forge, I would cast it into the fires forever...ashamed to even admit I was stupid enough to go down that road in the first place.<P>Perhaps, if you someday come to your senses and give Ornate Chainmail a unique look of its own, then I will take the hammer once again.  If Velium Platemail becomes available and is even remotely worth its price, that also may lure me.  If you have removed or changed the spell component for Enchant Adamantite so that Blue Diamond is no longer its key, then I will pull the smithy hammer from the mantle.<P>Until then, consider that you have failed me Yakatizma, and all the Tier'Dal, with this latest change...<P>-Zekestrom of the Many Names, Less One now...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>GristleBone wrote: "Get over it, all the other races had the same issue before and now there is a level playing field"<P>I must disagree you on this.  All the temper components for High Elf smithing are rare foraged items or ultra rare drops.  Then you get to the BDs, which we could get if we were lucky because they had no other uses than smithing.  Now with the mana + all resistance jewelry no one will part of these little gems.  This move by VI, for most smiths that needed BDs, just squashed Cultural Smithing out of realization.  I for one was looking forward to outfitting my casters with Enchanted Mitheral chain but have now had all hopes of that dashed.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/mad.gif"><P>Thanks VI<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Where's the balance?<P>Jewellery: a skill you can raise without moving from a single room, if you have enough plat, all the way up to 250. Or you can do it wherever you are, and make a profit on many many items. <BR>Then, with a single blue diamond, and a single bar of metal, you can make an item which gives five resistances and a substantial amount of mana, which is ALL/ALL and will be in high demand. Oh, and only one chance of failure per item too.<P>Smithing: A skill which you can raise to 175 with ingredients purchased in several different zones, which you can raise above that by travelling around the world hunting either sub-10 or 45+ monsters, with a chance at making magical items restricted severely by race, class, and often deity, with stats below the level of armor dropped from the same level monsters you are getting your components from. Then, if you are really good and really lucky, you can combine your gems (up to 10 blue diamonds or jacinths) and your metal, and your tailored silk swatches, and your brewed tempers (made from rare drop ingredients) into some enchanted armor, at which you have chances of failure at these points: brewing temper, making block, making ring, making armor.<P>Somehow, I don't think there is a risk/reward balance between the two.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well i guess i'll add my 2 copper....<P>Blue diamonds being used in jewlery sucks.  There is no way a high elf, dark elf, or ogre smith who is below lvl 45 is ever going to be able to make enchanter armor.  Period.  Even if we did have the money to buy the BD at the new over 1k pp price, i doubt enchanters would part with them since they can make a lot more pp than that from jewlery they can make.  And they will also out bid us smiths for the BD from other players.<P>Secondly, Could someone enlightened me why some of the races have extremely easy tempers (ogre's and their blood tempers, come on) and some gods require such paltry gems for imbuing while others requires extremely expensive ones.<P>If this was the real world i would just say "life's not fair" and go about my business.  However, verant keeps claiming that all the races and classes are "balanced" or they are working towards that goal.  Are they only refering to balance in combat?  If so, why do I keep hearing that one of the offsets of a rangers tracking ability is to make them less effective in combat (this is just a rumor, not from verant sources).<P>I would just like to know.  I certainly wouldn't call my, as a highelf, needing 2 essence of  moonlight (only drops in MM to my knowledge), swirling mists (this is an easy one), and morning dew (uncommon forage in gfay and lfay), and  to make a temper "fair and balanced" with an ogre needing 3 bloods (which drop off of max lvl 20 mobs and often at merchants) and ogre swill (sold at merchants).<P>And now that str is a factor in the smithing equations and shaman ogres doing as well if not better than my highelf enchanter smith, don't give me the line that ogres deserve a break for being so stupid. <P>Just my 2 copper<P>Kethaniel Dreamspinner<BR>20th High elf Enchanter<BR>7th Hammer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm going to have to defend Gristlebone on this one point.  The advantage you had over human/dwarven smiths was that blue diamonds were not jewelcraft items.  As for our high end armors (I'm a human smith), we've had to share jacinths with jewelers.  Don't get me wrong, jacinth jewelry in NO WAY compares to this awesome new blue diamond jewelry.<P>I too have given up smithing though.  Like many of you have stated, high end smithing has nearly no risk/reward anymore.  I could be wrong, but as far as my humie smith is concerned, it MAY be worth it to make imbued field plate (that doesn't require jacinths does it?).  Other than that though, the enchanted full plate is out of the question.<P>Oh well.  It is kind of sad that Verant is treating us smiths this way.  If only they would make the armor components easier to get for those people in the level 30ish range or so.  Well at least jewelcraft still has some validity.  As far as I'm concerned, when next I pick up a smithy hammer, it'll be in Origins aka UO2.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Blue diamonds will be extremely valuable for a month or two as the scramble to fill the jewelry demand goes haywire. In the end I predict they will fall to around the value of a Jacinth which last I heard was around 750-1K. Blue diamond jewelry adds mana and is without AC so it will not be an especially hot tank item except in special cases where the resists are necessary (PvP or duels mainly, since even caster MOBs hit pretty hard). Jacinth makes either +13 magic rings or AC10 rings, both of which are also quite valuable.<P>For those of you complaining that this removed access for lower level characters... you never had the opportunity to loot them in the first place. It was only their lack of value to anything but a merchant that made them accessible, so it doesn't seem like the highest end cultural smithing was designed for pre-50s to be attempting without help anyway.<P>This is an issue in my opinion because no sane 50+ character would pursue the results of this tradeskill except on a scarce few pieces, because they are either already wearing better, or able to buy better with the same amount of cash/effort. This leaves stubborn pride and curiousity as the only two factors that will ever get this stuff made.<P>I also still maintain that making the enchanted-imbued stuff have resistances like the blue diamond jewlery would get the stuff made.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>And to address one other point - I think there are some huge imbalances in the cost and benefits of cultural smithing. Ogres do have it easy in many ways as our gem is a 3.5pp jade and our worst temper component is Elven blood. On the other hand the jade only adds +str, we have no imbued version of our plate, we still have to find blue diamonds and get somebody else to enchant them and we have to buy our ore in a KOS zone in neriak, 13 zones away from our forge. And Ogre's only have one gating class and no porters, so it's much less common to see them skill up smithing.<P>If blue diamonds go for around 1k it would be around 4K+ to attempt any enchanted/imbued item. It would also have trivials well over 200 (possibly over 250) so the failure rate would either be huge, or a huge time and money investment would have to be made to skill up over 200. Say best case we ammortize this to 2x costs, that would make the Enchanted-Imbued Ogre War Plate Vambrace cost around 14K for an *AC12* arm which can only we worn by Rallos Zek Ogre and Troll plate classes. For 20K you can most likely buy a pair of cobalt vambraces... AC25 effect lesser shielding. What stats could possibly make that tradeoff worthwhile? And don't say maybe the Cobalt isn't for sale so you have no choice, because it's JUST as rare to get all the components together and find an Ogre with 200+ smithing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Gristlebone - You make an interesting point concerning Jacinth's in Human smithing, but I think you're way off base considering that we're now on a "Level Playing Field".  Consider the following:<P>Humans can smith two separate and distinct types of Cultural Armor...Field Plate and Full Plate.  Both of these armors can be made to provide Stat bonuses (the only real appeal to ANY of the Culturally smith'd armors).<P>Field Plate is an extremely versatile armor product, in that you can create Imbued-Only versions for a wide variety of deities, and these are usable by most any of the "Good" races that worship those deities.  Therefore, even without Full Plate, Human cultural smiths have an almost viable product to offer, which (most of the time), is relatively cheap to produce.<P>The entirety of Dark Elven (and yes, High Elven and Ogre as well...not leaving you guys out, just talking from my character's perspective  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">) ability to provide "stat-enhancing items" comes from a single, ultra-rare gem, the Blue Diamond.  (Whether it's chain or plate, they both require the gem in varying quantities).<P>I might almost be willing to accept your argument if there were not such a HUGE disparity in Jewelcrafting between the products of the Jacinth and the Blue Diamond.  Jacinth can be used EXCLUSIVELY to make Rings.  Granted, these rings can be nice, especially for Melee classes, but their product has an inherent penalty (you either go for high AC and suffer a MR reduction, or get no AC and get good Magic Resistance gear.<P>Look at the Blue Diamond...<P>The Blue Diamond can make stat-enhancing pieces for NO LESS THAN FIVE AREAS OF THE BODY.  Theoretically, if I'm looking to create resistance gear, I can fill EIGHT of my Inventory slots with Jacinth gear!  Resistance gear that is, by the way EASILY the rival of the best rare-gem gear that's out there.<P>I don't see how you can even consider that a fair playing field.<P>The ultimate test, of course, is whether or not Blue Diamonds will ever be availble to Dark Elven, Ogre, or High Elven smiths in the quantities that are necessary.  I don't think that's even in question, personally.  Jewelers are already commanding 1k+ prices for Blue Diamonds (a number which I expect to rise, by the way) and are selling Blue Diamond wares for FAR more than that.<P>I may not be psychic, but I think you've seen the END of experimentation with Enchanted Adamantite from this change.  It would take a TRULY warped die-hard to throw away the numbers of Blue Diamonds necessary to make Enchanted Adamantite.<P>More importantly, it's incredibly demoralizing to the already-forgotten Cultural communities out there.  Unless something positive is done soon, I see Cultural Smithing going the way of the dodo.<P>-Zekestrom of the Many Names</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OK I have to concede that more Blue Diamonds than Jacinths will go into JC, now and forever.<P>Your arguements about the human armor would *easily* be solved by adding imbued only versions to all cultural plate. If imbued Ogre War Plate had the same stats as the splint I would probably make several of the pieces... the visor, shoulders, arms, bracers and legs would all be fairly useful when compared to crafted. Other smiths would probaly cry foul though, since our armor already has the best AC, our tempers are relatively easy and our gem is cheap.<P>And cultural smithing has NOT gone the way of the dodo... because at some point the dodo thrived.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> If you were going to describe enchanted imbued plate, I think the word "stillborn" would be more appropriate. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Verant has once again created a marketplace where there is only ONE tradeskill that is viable for the pursuit of platinum.... JewelCraft<P>Jewelcraft had already attained its perch upon the top of the Pantheon of Mt. Olympus. For some reason, unknown to myself, Verant has decided to raise their perch yet another notch while at the same time managing to crush any hope that blacksmiths might have had. <P>Lets take a moment to consider a few comparisons between Jewelcraft and Blacksmithing:<P>Jewelcraft:<BR>1. Jewelcraft is primarily DOMINATED by one class - Enchanters. Yes, there are others but really...90% of all jewelers are Enchanters<P>2. Prior to the introduction of Blue Diamonds... 90 outta 105 jewelcrafting pieces could be made by sitting right next to a merchant. The only exceptions were Jacinth, Black Sapphire, and Diamond jewelry (5 items each with Velium items included). This makes Jewelcrafting the EASIEST, ingredient wise, skill to pursue.<P>3. Jewelcraft has the HIGHEST cost-to-resale value of any trade. Even items that are trivial to jewelry crafters when their skill is under 80 can be resold for a profit, or worst case for the cost of the ingredients.<P>4. Every item made with Jewelcraft has significantly greater resale potential than any item set that can be made by ANY and ALL other tradeskills.. go ahead... try to sell a file that you had to make as a blacksmith, or a muffin by a baker for that matter.<P>5. The Jewelcraft skill can market ALL of their items to EVERY person in the game. Every other skill has items that are only needed by a rare and select few.<P>6. Regardless of what some may say, a person could reach a skill of 150 in jewelcraft with 400pp or less. I have an enchanter friend whose skill is 153, and thru his own meticulously kept records, he has spent 417pp that he has not yet been able to recover costs for.<P><BR>Blacksmithing:<P>1. Blacksmithing is a skill with NO dominant class. From Bards to Wizzards, everybody can be a blacksmith.<P>2. Blacksmithing requires the use of a stationary forge. And there are NO merchants located exactly next to a forge that stock ANY or ALL of the items required for blacksmithing. Therefore, EVERY person who engages in blacksmithing MUST travel in order to pursue their skill... whether it be a couple stores down, or 13 zones away.<P>3. Tens, if not hundreds, of items required for blacksmithing are rare or uncommon mob drops. Compared to 3 total items for Jewelcrafting.<P>4. Blacksmithing has one of the LOWEST cost-to-resale values AND every item created with a trivial of 80 or less either only has 1 specific use to a person in another trade skill or has to be resold to a merchant for a heavy loss.<P>5. Until a blacksmith can create banded mail, which trivials at 102 and up, every item he/she can create has an extremely crippled resale value or in the best case, has a singular unique (but NOT in demand) potential market.<P>6. Even items at the Pinnacle of blacksmithing have a limited market to classes who can wear the goods.<P>7. With unique use items and a Verant crippled, not to mention limited, blacksmithing market.. the costs to obtain a proficiency in blacksmithing are much more formidible than those of the jewelcrafting skill.<P>8. Considering the enormous amount of time, exhorbanent ingredient costs, rarity of components, and monatory drain blacksmithing entails it is simply amazing that so many blacksmiths have decided to leave their chosen love.<P>Yet considering all of this... Verant has decided to take the "Holy Grail" of sought after High Elf, Dark Elf, and Ogre ingredients... the extremely rare Blue Diamond... and give it a use to the Jewelcrafters????<P>Like they didn't already have enough profit potential. Verant decided to throw the last bucket of water on the ever-so-slightly smoldering embers of a viable blacksmithing trade.<P>What were you thinking Verant? With all the well thought out updates and patches recently that were not only appreciated, but value added to the EQ community you have taken another step backwards in the balancing of the tradeskills.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>Unfortunately I realize that this message will probably never be read or responded to by the staff of Verant... I feel what you have done to cultural blacksmithing is a grave injustice to the game, and I needed to express my opinions.<P>Fare thee well fellow smiths! For I now hang my hammer among the other honored retired smiths.<P>Panteroo Mcgillakudy<BR>Master Smith on Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bah, there's a lot of melodrama going on around here.<P>Verant puts in some extremely caster useful jewelry which has no negative tradeoffs besides 0AC and can be used in 8 equipment slots, and you're hung up on some armor that was never destined to be that good in the first place.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I know I know... I was lured in by the dream of smithing useful and valueable items too, but a game as large and dynamic as EQ is difficult to balance, and the cultural smithed items fell below the waterline compared to dropped items.<P>If the new jewelery were removed at this point, I'd say a MUCH larger portion of the EQ population would be upset. Failing that, how about some useful solutions for verant to make cultural smithing more engaging again?<P>Things that might help:<P>A) Reduce the cost.<BR>B) Reduce the hassle involved.<BR>C) Make the end goal more useful.<P>Vary these three ingredients enough and we're back at it again.

About the only thing that could make this not such an insult is to remove the requirement to use the blue diamonds to enchant adamantite/mithril, or at least allow us to create imbued only version of the chain AND PLATE!<BR>Heck, I'd make Rallos Zek imbued Adamantite for any warriors that needed it, but my brother is a dark elf warrior, and he follows Innoruuk anyway.<P>p.s.

</FONT><HR>     I wanted to start off by thanking Yakatizma for even upgrading these tradeskills. They sat utterly useless for a long time, and you have made wonderful modifications to them.<BR>    I don't share my companions problems with the mods here, as a dark elf smith. That is to say, that I am sure that if availible of components was in your opinion of problem, you would simply alter the drop rates of the blue diamonds or whatever component.<BR>     I would however, as a Dark Elf smith like to address somethings: First let me say I understand this is a work in progress, and you are continually making alterations. However, let me say that being a dark elf smith has been extremely frustrating because of constantly fighting with the multiple mods that have been made.  As a long time DE smith, I sat with Blue diamonds gathered in advance waiting for this smithing patch. When the spells became availible, I had enchanted Admantite. However, I've spent HOURS and DAYS working on recipes for enchanted non-Imbrued chain and Plate armors (since the patch day first came) only to finally surrender, and accept that the recipes weren't in the game. Will enchanted Teir'dal chain and plate be in the game? (non imbrued)  I don't know, thats your call.  I understand that Dark Elf Armors arent the best from a warriors stand point, let me say that I agree with this, Darkelf warriors are a minority.  I understand that Darkelf armors don't support other religions, we're supposed to be Purist by nature. (in your world other gods = other races)  Makes sence.  However the one thing I ask... I beg... is when you patch and release this stuff could you please please put a list of what is actually craftable at that moment?  I understand you like people to experiment and I agree with that as well. However it was no fun spending hours working on enchanted chain jointing recipes, only to find that well more then 30 days later the recipe with added.<BR>     Just a release list of mods to these systems is all I am asking please. Otherwise very well done, Yakatizma!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Zekestrom, Gristlebone, Pantaloo: wonderful posts - well thought out, and well written. Representative of my thoughts at least!<P>Velnous: Enchanted chain is in game, other than boots. Enchanted plate has never worked, true.<P>Yakatizma: Your additions to the tradeskills are well appreciated, and have kept many of us busy for some time. I almost wrote "entertained" or "amused", but "frustrated" seems to be closer to the bone nowadays. You have an opportunity here to balance risk/reward. Several options, in fact, before many smiths walk away in disgust.<P>1. Reduce the number of blue diamonds needed to make enchanted plate. 10 Blue Diamonds per attempt at a breastplate or leggings is a lot, especially with four separate possible points of failure compared to Jewellery's single point of failure.<P>2. Review the stats on Enchanted Adamantite and Mithril Plate, as well as (enchanted) Imbued Adamantite Plate. Perhaps make it worth losing the possibility to make ten separate pieces of jewellery, which if worn (which 8 at a time can be!) will give at least +50 to all resistances, by making the enchanted plate desireable in light of this, even comparable. Of course, that would mean a full set of enchanted plate (13 pieces, or 80-odd blue diamonds) would give upwards of +500 to all resists, or perhaps a total of 150-200 stat points...<P>The opportunity is there to review the enchanted plate stats, simply because it has NEVER YET been possible to produce it because of a string of implementation errors or bugs. I can understand not reviewing the chain, because A) It's in game already; and B) It's chain for casters, with AC benefits and a neat look otherwise unavailable to them.<P>3. Allow Enchant Mithril and Enchant Adamantite to enchant (purchasable?) BLOCKS of ore instead of (or as an alternative to) LARGE BRICKS of ore with a single Blue Diamond as is currently the case.<P>4. Replace Blue Diamonds as a component for Enchant Mithril and Adamantite spells. This would also put pressure on removing Diamonds, Jacinths and other precious gems from smithing or enchant-metal spells, or to review the benefits of including them in smithing as compared to other crafts (jewellery, and the requirement of Purify Mana to use 4 rubies per spell, needed in new leathers or Fine Furs)<P>Alternatively, or additionally, the implementation of Imbued-only armor for Teir'dal, Koada'dal and Ogres with implementations for all of those races' members, including Innoruuk-worshipping troll warriors and shaman, Cazic-Thule worshipping darkelven warriors, and odd-god-loving High Elven clerics would be welcomed too.<P><BR>As an additional note, a more regular presence on this message board would be appreciated by many, including what bugs have been fixed (so we don't have to test every broken recipe after every patch), what bugs are still recognised as not working (robe patterns, many boots, and fleeting quivers spring to mind), or some answer to many of our points. If this tradesfolk board is not seen to be visited or actively read, its usefulness is diminished, and our discussions will likely be taken either amongst ourselves (on http://www.eqtraders.com ) or on the main discussion forum, neither of which benefit either the playing community or Verant Interactive quite so well.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>All hail melodrama!  (Where would we be without it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">)<P>Seriously, though.  I think, Yakatizma, that you have made a mistake with this one.  It's not irreparable, however, and I can offer some advice as to what could be done to make us happier:<P>First, ASIDE from the Blue Diamond problem:<P>- Fix the Enchanted Plate recipes (ok, well, I list this as #1, but it's really immaterial if Blue Diamonds are still required as components).<P>Now, back to Blue Diamonds:<P>Option #1: Modify Enchant Adamantite to use a different spell component.  No idea what, Flawless Aquamarine might be a possibility, or perhaps a new item.  Adjust the drop rates as necessary for whatever you choose, but PLEASE be sure to see what else it might affect first.<P>Option #2: Implement more Imbued-Only versions of armor for High Elves and Dark Elves (and an Imbued-Only plate for Ogres).  This may or may not be an option, and should IDEALLY be done to allow support for more than one additional Deity, but at least these cultural smiths could provide a moderately improved product without the need for Blue Diamonds.<P>Option #3: Make the end-product of Enchanted Adamantite processes worth the materials going into it.  I shudder to think what kind of uber-items would come from this, but if an Enchanted Adamantite Breastplate offered 25 AC, +15 to all resists, and perhaps a stat bonus, it might be worth blowing 10 Blue Diamonds on.  (The point here being that if the product has enough of a desirability for a market, then it's POSSIBLE that people will be willing to try using them with Cultural recipes.  This could be extremely difficult to gauge, since everyone will have a different opinion of what 10 Blue Diamonds are worth, but I think you can probably come up with SOMETHING that's comparable.  If you need to, check out going prices on Blue Diamond jewelry and compare it to Breastplates that go for the same cost.  At least it's somewhere to start.)<P>I don't really mean to say that this is the downfall of smithing, or of the trade skills...I'm not quite THAT alarmist.  I do, however, think this spells the end of Enchanted Adamantite if something isn't done.

</FONT><HR>This really is a problem, and I think deserves a solution.  I see three possabilities:<P>1:  Change the enchant adamantite (and other metal enchants requiring rare stones for that matter) to use a more common gem appropriate for the quality of the finished product.<P>2:  Increase the stats on the smithed items requiring all these diamonds, jacinth, whatever, to an appropriate level to compete with the bonuses provided by jewelry, multiplied by the number of the gems required (enhance AC and stats more than the current numbers, think an appropriate example was the 10 BDs required for the 3 sheet adamantite plate pieces).  As it is, it's simply not worth it).<P>3:  Increase the availability of these jems to the point that their cost is substantially reduced.  Perhaps place them on vendors, or lower level mobs.  There's no point in requiring such rare, hard to get (high level chars req'd) for armor that's really only good for lower level people (by the time you can get these stones you're usually high enough level to get better armor from the mobs you're killing than the armor produced from smithing).<P>My 2 copper.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Whelp I'm an enchanter<P>(shushes the booing)<P>I also like blacksmithing more than Jewelcraft. (both are master) first off, on any older server JC is worth almost no cash, especially lower level stuff...anyone want a +2 sv poison bracer (no ac), how about a +1 strength earring also no ac, hmm everyone needs an additional 2 agility or stamina right???<BR>it used to be that JC at the higher level stuff would sell very well, then most people found out they had a jewelcrafter in their guild that would sell for material cost. so not much money there either, plus items are recycled and sold when people get better items, usually for less than what they bought at... basically the prices plummeted.<P>That said I like smithing and really wanted to make some of my cultural armor (koada-dal) ahvell, I figured a long time ago that I would have to use standard cultural chain if I wsanted to make any (due to rarity) now there is no doubt. well at least I can use it to replace my raw silk armor.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'd just like to second the post made earlier that said that we are NOT looking for you to take away the Jewlecraft change.  By itself the Jewelcraft change is a WONDERFUL addition, and tradesmen everywhere are happy to see you adding content to a part of the game long considered "secondary" at best.<P>What we're wanting you to look at, primarily, is the effect that this change has had on the OTHER tradeskill that makes use of this component.  We really don't want this to become an anti-Jewelcrafting thread...we're just looking for a fix to the problem it causes Adamantite Smithing.<P>*Bumps into the tread on the way out the door, knocking it on the ground*<P>*blush* Oops!<P>-Zekestrom of the Many Names</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
