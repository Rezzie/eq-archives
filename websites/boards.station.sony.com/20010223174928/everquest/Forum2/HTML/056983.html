</FONT><HR>Before the release of RoK, everyone was very happy with the game.  Classes were balanced, the economy was stable, and only 6 or 7 people per server had an Electrum-Bladed Wakizashi.<P>Now, the bombshell, Verant introuduces level 51 to 60.  Yes, it would have been great if Verant keep the margin of difference between classes equal into post-50, but no.  Warriors became the main class for it.  Warriors gained a HUGE increase of HP post-50, with Rogues coming in second.  Rogues became the new gods in the park, with Warriors tanking for them.  Rogues could Evade and do damage, and even tank, since their defence is higher than Rangers, who happen to be tanks.  Plate-using classes also had an increase to defence skills (Dodge, Parry, Riposte), yet the light armor classes got nothing.<P>Now, tell me...can a bulky, plate-wearing class dodge better than a lightly armored, agile Ranger?  This is where we realized Verant did not know what they were doing.  Rogues got Safe-Fall yet they were wearing plate armor faster than Rangers.<P>Why is it, that a Monk or Rogue who is NOT a tank, can actually tank BETTER than some Rangers or Paladins?!  Monks use LEATHER for god's sake!<P>It goes downhill from here...they try to fix this by giving Rangers Jolt.  Bad move.  Instead of helping, it actually adds agro when it is resisted, which happens quite a bit, and its hard to cast when a mob is hitting you for 200s.<P>With Evade being nerfed for Rogues, it will put them in danger of being killed as fast as a Ranger, but they still have very high defence and skill caps, so the nerf may not be so bad.<P>Verant REALLY went wrong when they made Jolt a spell.  Rangers are still lacking anything that links them to druids.  They also lack anything that any other class doesn't have.<P>Wizards are also underpowered since they have spells that are resisted so much, that they end up using a ton of mana for nothing.  Even a 2k nuke is not enough to stand up again a mob with 200k of hp.<P>Levels 51 to 60 have really widened the gap between the melee classes and casting classes.  Verant should re-think their idea and try to make the gap smaller, so a Warrior is still the main tank in EQ, but not a requirement for survival when a Paladin could fill in the role.  Need a damage dealer?  Rangers can do more damage than any other class in EQ by using melee, DoTs, nukes, and damage shields.  But when the mob taunts on the Ranger, he has no time to cast or be interupted to cast Jolt, which probably will be resisted and, with his low defence and dodge, be killed in 2 seconds.<P>Rogues on the other hand, have time.  Since they have very high defence (which is does not make since Rangers are light tanks and Rogues are NOT tanks) to hit the Evade key, that is automatically used, and ALWAYS works, and is never resisted or needed time to cast, or interupted.<P>Monks just Feign Death, but they also have more defence than a Light Tanks, yet they are not tanks at all (they wear LEATHER).<P>RoK really ruined EverQuest.  Verant widened the gap between classes so much, that the game is not playable without a Warrior, Rogue, Cleric, or Enchanter.  This is their downfall, and they should think about fixing it before they lose their players to about 50 other online RPGs that are coming out soon.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"...that is automatically used, and ALWAYS works, and is never resisted or needed time to cast, or interupted"<P>Heh, hate to say this but nothing from that quote is true...evade works maybe 40% of the time on a good day, can be interrupted if im hit before using it, reuse time is about 10 seconds(jolt is what, instant?), and even if its succesful does not always anti-taunt the mob.  Evade isnt as godly as you made it out to be...<BR>     I do agree with the rest of your post though, the balance gap needs to be looked at post-50</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Details. The core complaint is true; the post 50 expansion reduced the game to Warriors, Clerics, Enchanters (now getting screwed in Veliious), rogues, and perhaps an occassional necro willing to act as a mana battery (which is NOT what folks who picked necros had in mind).<P>The guys who designed the expansions should have been fired.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Destroy?  No.  Seriously screw with balance?  Yep.  I don't think there was near enough balance testing with RoK, and certainly not Velious.  That's why we are seeing all these constant nerfs and upgrades, trying to balance it.  I don't think there is anything inherently wrong with that, but it does suck somewhat.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"Before the release of RoK, everyone was very happy with the game. Classes were balanced, the economy was stable"<P>I have to disagree completely. There were many many serious problems pre-RoK. Essentially we traded one set of problems for another.<P>However, pre-RoK had one very important thing the 50+ world is not so good at. You could easily gather a few friends no matter what class they played and go and play for an hour or two and get experience without turning it into a major project and a huge pain in the butt. The overspecialization of classes induced a degree of mobflation that really hurt the playability of the game.<P>I disagree with you pinning this on rogues by the way. Rogues seem to have the spotlight now but they are far away from being the uber class some people think they are.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>/agree.<P> there were issues before RoK, but nothing like the extreme ones we have today, and Velious only made it that much worse.Casters are crippled almost to the point of uselessness in Velious.<P> Funny thing is i have an Iksar shaman i play , currently in FoB and i love the character and<BR>race, but still have to admit that the addition of Kunark was when the Game initially became skewed to an unacceptable degree.<P> Hopefully Verant is now looking at ways to remedy all of this and will get Casters back in to the high level game, and get things somewhat balanced overall again. It is indeed difficult to percieve what a code change you write on papers actual effect or outcome will be in game at times, as no two people have the same style of gameplay so one change may be well recieved by one while another person playing same class/level but not as good at using this skill may not be as impressed by it, etc.<P> Be that as it may, incredible magic resists of the MoBs in Velious is crazy , and this is indeed no more than an assignrd value, i can't believe <BR>Verant hasn't already had a programmer go in and fix this during one of the many 8 hour maintenance sessions we seem to have on the servers.<P> ah well, gotta get better,or we'll get better at adapting to it., like always.<P>                Naz</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Yes.<P>I don't want to level.  I want to play the game.<P>The game could have been just as interesting and as challenging for numerous level 50s fighting slightly lesser uber bosses than that of Kunark/Velious but the fights and encounters would have been compariably the same.<P>You don't believe me how difficult these mobs could be?  Try doing Vox or Naggy.  Compare that to doing CT or Draco.  I don't know about your guild but we absolutely demolished Fear with the highest level being 55.  Being capped to 52 with Vox is one ***** of a fight and will sometimes take a 2nd or even 3rd try.  Naggy always goes down but he still takes a major sized hit squad to eliminate. <P>What's my point?<P>The game can be made plenty hard for ANY level that encounters it.  With adding 51-60 they just made the game harder based on the fact you need to spend more time in it leveling if you want to be able ot participate in any of the high end game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Seems to me that what has spoilt the game (ruined is too strong a word that would imply everyone giving up rather than the few who do at present) is the introduction of constant hell-levels post 50, and the imbalance of Velious which is simply too tough to make any sense.<P>I would say get rid of hell-levels altogether, they just p*ss the players off which makes no sense at all, tone down Velious and raise the level cap to 70. No need to introduce new skills/abilities every level, just give people something further to aim for.<P>As for class balancing, the original poster's contention that the classes were balanced pre-RoK isn't how I recall this board reporting it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> and things have certainly got out of kilter recently. By tweaking the 50+ game thru a rethink of Velious and the end-cap as well as hell-levels, and with the outcome of the class reviews Absor has been leading recently, I have no doubt things will improve and get more balanced again.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056983&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056983&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
