</FONT><HR>Ridiculous you should even have to ask.  Indicative of the way things are now though.  Kids are so lacking in any kind of moral character these days.<P>Let use the "Golden Rule" here.  You probably don't know what that is so I'll explain it to you.  The "Golden Rule" Is "Do unto others as you would like to have done unto you"  What this means is think about how you like to be treated, how you like to be talked to, and do the same to others you meet.  So if you think you would like it if someone stole a very nice weapon from you, then by all means, please do keep it.  If you think you would really appreciate it if someone gave you your very nice weapon back after you made a mistake, then by all means, give it back.<P>Just remember, you Reap what you sow.  Another old time coloquialism you probably don't understand.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree with the people in this thread who have said that they are amazed the question even had to be asked. Of COURSE you give it back to him. That is, if you have any honor.<P>I once had a higher level player show me a Runed Mithril Bracer, which would have been a sweet addition to my Barb Shaman (and which I still hope to get someday). The same thing the original poster described happened-- it dropped on the ground as he hit Cancel. Without even thinking about it I picked it up and gave it back to him.<P>It wasn't mine, I hadn't earned it, and he wasn't giving it to me in the first place-- he was merely letting me see it. Keeping it would have been the lowest thing I could have done, and would have permanently ruined my reputation on my server. Not to mention the reputation of the guild whose name was over my head.<P>To Paul554-- you are lower than low for even asking such a thing, and I hope the guy whose Wurmslayer you stole-- yes, STOLE-- sees this. Then maybe he'll see that there are people who play this game who actually DO have a sense of fair play.<P>The fact you even saw the criticism of your being dishonorable shows that you know what you did was wrong. Live with that, and live with whatever consequences follow you on the server you play on. You brought it all on yourself.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

He would appologize every time and do it again.  <P>When named orc spawned he looted it and said that he accidentaly right clicked the invulnerbility doll so it was gone.  We told him not to loot until we all roll and all orcs are killed.  The named orc popped again and the sk looted the SBH while we were still in battle.  He said that he didn't have it because his inventory was full when he looted the named orc so it was dropped on the ground.  The SBH was no where to be found on the ground.  It was really hard to believe that a dropped weapon poofed in less than 30 sec.  We warned him again not to loot during battle.  He appologized.  The named orc popped again after a while.  The sk looted the weight-reducing pouch this time while in battle.  When asked if he had it he said that his inventory was full again and it was dropped on the ground.  The pouch was no where to be found on the ground.<P>By this point the entire group was fed up with him.  We regrouped without him and ks'ed every orc he tried to solo.  One of our group members was in an uber guild and placed the sk's name on the "enemies of the guild list".  The last thing I remember is that the sk was forced to log from frustration everytime he was spotted by the uber guild members.  They made his game a living hell.<P>Just a thought.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well whatever the reason the guy dropped the Wurmslayer, it was his responsibility for  dropping it. Verant seems to agree and probably won't come after you for the item. I'd keep it. And don't even think twice of the reputation issue, there's thousands on the servers. As long as you don't post your character name here, and I advise you don't, there's no proof of what you did. I really don't think the whole server'll will refuse to group with you. Especially when some of them are desperate enough that they need someone in a party. I personally after spending say minutes or even hours of looking for someone to group with, would not refuse them just because they picked up an item that someone accidentaly dropped. Yes, you can give the item back in an act of kindness if you so choose. But don't do it on the basis of some imaginary server blacklisting.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It is sad that it comes to this.  Is this the first time you asked someone to show you an item, only to have it fall on the ground so you can scoop it up?  I had a fellow on Rallos do this to me when I was unaware of the drop bug from the trade window.  He kept scamming me about a bug and not seeing the item in the window, so when we cancelled, my item dropped to the ground and he grabbed it and gated.  After a few tells from some guildmembers, and some conversations with some GM's, he did bring the item back to me.  Said he couldn't see it due to the same bug, but was a lot of crap, of course.  To this day, I won't buy or sell anything to him, and I inform people of his previous scam attempts.  I know I've prevented a few people from trading with him in the past month, possibly several.<P>I hold a grudge.  I keep a list of those I dislike.  The more obnoxious and aggravating ones, along with PK's, I keep in the 20 slot 'Friends' list for possible destruction at a later date, as well as a definite NO BUFF, NO TELEPORT, NO SALES/PURCHASING list.<P>So don't listen to the idiots who say your reputation isn't a big deal.   You may be able to find a group, but you may miss out on some groups you would like to join.  That planes group you'd like to go with might just happen to find another member when one of the group members says, 'Hey!  That's the jerk who stole that wurmslayer from Joe-Bob a month ago.'  That group camping the Froggie King may tell you that they don't have an opening although they only have 5 people in the group.  If you play on Rallos, you may find life a bit interesting as you get attacked periodically by people who find you repulsive.  These things do happen.  I've been on the giving end of some of this type of indirect and direct retribution.<P>Besides all of the threats, giving it back is the right thing to do.  I picked up a stein of mogguk near the ruins in EC one day about a year ago.  No one around, just a mug lying on the ground.  I offered up an /ooc asking if anyone had lost something in the ruins area recently.  I had a fellow tell me the item lost and exactly where he had lost it.  He was showing it to someone and didn't realize it had dropped when they closed the trade window.  He was most grateful when I gave it to him.  I've since moved servers, but I never regretted the decision to return the item at all.<P>Give it back.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Let me tell you a story of something that happened on Prexus, was not me on either end but both parties posted what happened.<P>A wizard traded a few items with another player.  Due to the monk weapons looking the same he gave this person the wrong one, a weapon that outvalued all he got by itself and then some.  The person agreed they would give it back but did not.  The wizard petitioned and the GM said give it back or be suspended, he gave it back.  Oh and when he suspended him he was going to take the item and give it back.<P>What you did will get a GM involved, can easily be call a trade scam in that you asked to see an item known to not fit in packs and fast grabbed it off the ground after you cancelled the trade.  Even if you did not mean to would be hard to prove it and by not giving it back you just reinforce your intentions as being underhanded.  Also if on my server it would spread and trust me you would not like the hate you would get.<P>Honesty is important, I lost random on a dragon item but the random was spammed off, shortly after screwing around I randomed the highest number by far.  I told the raid leader, a good friend of mine that it was not my roll and that I lost.  Was not worth it even if no one would have found out.<P>Eryl Flynn Level 51 Wood Elf Minstrel on Prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Asking someone to put a large item in a trade window, then moving away or cancelling in the hopes that the item will drop and you can snatch it is a known scam, and they'll nail you for it.
