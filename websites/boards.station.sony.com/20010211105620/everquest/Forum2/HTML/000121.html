&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>(by Nicolbolas, Karana)<BR>Hello, this is a repost, since the board was deleted. There was even an earlier topic before, which I don't want to repost because it's out-of-date, but if you want to check it, most of the live discussion happened on:<BR>http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum7/HTML/000394.html<P>---------------------------------------------------------------<BR>dravon<BR>Station Member  posted 07-29-2000 04:59 AM <P>1) Provocative Q & A<BR>2) Claim for Al'Kabor<BR>3) Claim for Wizard Rains <P>1) Provocative Q & A<BR>-------------------------------<BR>Questions:<BR>- Is AE damage the third main gameplay attribute of Wizards after DD and Teleport ?<BR>- Is AE damage a reason to play a Wizard ?<BR>- Can Wizards "shine" with AE damage ?<BR>- Do Wizards have at least one good AE damage spell per spell rank ?<BR>- Are Wizards "masters" of AE damage ? <P>Answer to all these questions:<BR>- YES... AFTER LEVEL 50 ! <P>Because AE damage spells got a much greater "post-50 versus pre-50" boost than DD, in all respects: mana-efficiency, swiftness, and size.<BR>Pre-50, only a few scattered AE damage spells are good (the newbie spells, the Columns, and Thunderclap). <P>Is this an incentive to level up beyond 50 ?<BR>Or is it the insulting confirmation that intermediate-level Wizards (formerly high-level) were fooled ?<BR>What if I don't want to buy Ruins of Kunark: I never get the shining AE ? Aren't levels 1-50 supposed to be a complete game, and levels 51+ be an EXTENSION only ? <P>2) Claim for Al'Kabor<BR>------------------------------<BR>Gameplay peril: Al'Kabor spells are range spells, and their wide radius makes it too easy to kite 5 mobs at once (much easier than to kite 2-3 mobs with Columns).<BR>Main inherent nerf negating the peril: low damage/mana per mob (the lowest of all AE spells), so that we run out of mana before the mobs are dead (even high-green mobs).<BR>Additional minor inherent nerf: long cast time and recast time.<BR>Additional minor inherent nerf: you can hurt yourself with the spell.<BR>Additional minor inherent nerf (or design blunder): the size of the level 20, 29 and 39 Al'Kabor spells doesn't keep up with level progression.<BR>Result from a player's point of view: the wide radius is extraordinarily over-priced (in mana and time consumed), and NOBODY PLAYS the Al'Kabor spells, although some insist on three phoney and overrated benefits: low aggro (the same is achieved with a more efficient lower-rank Column or PB spell), spell interruption (only a few Al'Kabor spells do that, and the same is achieved with a more efficient lower-rank PB spell), and wide-radius initial pull (please find a way to pull your mobs without crippling your mana bar, there are many). <P>Fix demands (I want the two of them, 2.a AND 2.b): <P>2.a) Resize the level 20, 29 and 39 Al'Kabor spells with a mana cost increment of 75 instead of 50, so that they cost 175, 250 and 325 mana respectively (instead of 150, 200 and 250), AND give all the pre-51 spells +10% damage for the mana (with corresponding aggro). This is the MINIMUM ensuring:<BR>- that the level 20, 29 and 39 Al'Kabor spells do more damage per mob than the previous Column (currently they do less damage, it's ridiculous),<BR>- that the pre-51 Al'Kabor spells don't make us LOSE mana-efficiency versus DD on 3 mobs (still, with this fix, they will give a +3-9% bonus only, whereas Columns give +75-90%; and they will still NEVER allow to successfully kite packs of high-green or low-blue mobs).<BR>Namely:<P>Lvl 12 Frost Spiral: 46 starting damage (42x1.1) for 100 mana.<BR>Lvl 20 Fire Spiral: 91 starting damage (71x175/150x1.1) for 175 mana.<BR>Lvl 29 Shock Spiral: 154 starting damage (112x250/200x1.1) for 250 mana.<BR>Lvl 39 Force Spiral: 237 starting damage (166x325/250x1.1) for 325 mana.<BR>Lvl 49 Wrath of Al'Kabor: 493 starting damage (448x1.1) for 500 mana. <P>This demand (2.a) is only the first part, so that the intermediate-level spells aren't plain awful; it isn't enough to make Al'Kabor spells good (the wide radius will still be very much over-priced, and players will continue to fancy the Columns doing about the same damage per mob, whenever available). Making Al'Kabor spells good is the second part below (2.b). <P>2.b) Give all Al'KAbor spells (including post-50) a specific reward to be attractive in spite of the low damage/mana per mob, which can be EITHER extra-swiftness or debuff (the two options will make use of the wide radius nicely). <P>FIRST OPTION of 2.b: EXTRA-SWIFTNESS (should be easy to code)<BR>Squandering mana for superior swiftness on mob-pack scale would be an interesting development of the Wizards' classic strong point. <BR>Al'Kabor cast time:<BR>Mana and time are two resources which are consumed to cast a spell. If Al'Kabor spells are costly in mana, make them cheap in time (cost trade-off). It doesn't matter if the cast time is shorter than DD (they also do less damage per mob than DD, don't they ?). Let Columns shine with their higher mana-efficiency, and let Al'Kabor spells shine with greater swiftness: higher "damage/cast time" on 1 mob than Columns (also post-50). Columns have an average "damage/cast time" on 1 mob equal to 56-67% of DD pre-50, and 78-87% of Draught post-50. Give Al'Kabor spells a "damage/cast time" on 1 mob equal to 70-75% of DD pre-50, and 82-92% of Draught post-50.This is achieved with the following casting times (taking into account the damage increases in 2.a above): <P>Lvl 12 Frost Spiral: 1.8 cast time (instead of 3.1). <BR>Lvl 20 Fire Spiral: 2.5 cast time (instead of 3.6). Note: the reference DD for swiftness is inbetween Force Shock and Flame Shock. <BR>Lvl 29 Shock Spiral: 3.2 cast time (instead of 4.0). <BR>Lvl 39 Force Spiral: 4.1 cast time (instead of 5.0). <BR>Lvl 49 Wrath of Al'Kabor: 4.8 cast time (instead of 6.3). Note: the reference DD for swiftness is inbetween Ice Comet and Rend. <BR>Lvl 53 Inferno of Al'Kabor: 4.2 cast time (instead of 5.0). <BR>Lvl 56 Retribution of Al'Kabor: 4.2 cast time (instead of 5.0). <BR>Lvl 59 Vengeance of Al'KAbor: 4.2 cast time (instead of 5.0). <P>The impact of these changes on the maximum single-cast swiftness (damage output speed on 5 mobs versus DD speed) is large, of course: DD's swiftness is multiplied by about x3.5 pre-50 and x4-4.5 post-50 (instead of about x2 pre-50 and x3.5-4 presently). So what ? that's the point. <P>Al'Kabor recast time:<BR>A pseudo-chain-casting of AE spells can be achieved by rotating certain combinations of two spells (for instance, I think a level 54 Wizard can effectively rotate Pillar of Frost and Pillar of Lightning, and get a huge damage output speed on 2-3 mobs). Give Al'Kabor spells the comfort of being ALMOST chain-castable without occupying a second memory slot:<BR>recovery time 4 seconds instead of about 9 seconds presently (Columns have 6).<BR>Quasi-chain-casting will allow Al'Kabor spells to shine in their own way (double or triple cast for emergency take-down and/or voluntary mass taunt).<BR>The impact of this changes on the maximum chain-cast swiftness (damage output speed on 5 mobs versus DD speed, taking to account cast time AND recast time) is large, of course: DD's swiftness is multiplied by x2.2-2.7 pre-50 and x3.6-4.1 post-50 (instead of x1.1 pre-50 and x2.2-2.5 post-50 presently). But that's the point.<BR>Such speed for Al'Kabor MAY be worth letting the mana run low fast. <P>SECOND OPTION of 2.b (instead of extra-swiftness): DEBUFF (may be difficult to code, but can be most appreciated)<BR>Is debuff against the spirit of Wizardry ? Not necessarily. The Staff of Temperate Flux is a hint, and we could get AE debuff spells instead of single-mob debuff spells, in the same way we get AE snare spells instead of single-mob snare spells. Will AE debuff spells make us independent from Shamen, Magicians and Enchanters ? No, because Al'Kabor spells are so expensive that they won't be worth using on only 1 mob, and hardly on 2. Typically, the debuffing classes will help Wizards against lone mobs, but will have more urgent things to do than debuff the mobs one-by-one when facing a pack, so a single cast of an Al'Kabor debuff spell would fill the functional gap.<BR>The debuff we want is the debuff directed against the energy type of same-rank DD.<BR>Of course, the debuff should not be as large as Mag/Sha/Enc debuffs, and, especially, the debuffs against magic must be lower than those against heat and cold, because they will also favorize Root and stun, and will challenge directly the Enchanter debuffs (Enchanters get an AE debuff of 40 against magic at level 60).<BR>If this fix, for some game engine reason, makes the effect of Al'Kabor spells all-or-nothing (such as Force Shock or Tishan's Clash), the resistance likelihood must be REAL low - I'm not spending hours writing all this to make the spells better, not worse.<BR>In this fix option, the cast time of the level 20, 29 and 39 spells can be bluntly increased according to the resize (2.a): who cares to get higher "damage/cast time" than before, if the debuff is the prize. <P>Lvl 12 Frost Spiral: 6 debuff against magic, 3.1 cast time (unchanged). <BR>Lvl 20 Fire Spiral: 9 debuff against magic, 4.2 cast time (3.6x175/150). <BR>Lvl 29 Shock Spiral: 15 debuff against heat, 5.0 cast time (4.0x250/200). <BR>Lvl 39 Force Spiral: 12 debuff against magic, 7.0 cast time (5.0x325/250). <BR>Lvl 49 Wrath of Al'Kabor: 20 debuff against cold, 6.3 cast time (unchanged). <BR>Lvl 53 Inferno of Al'Kabor: 25 debuff against heat, 5.0 cast time (unchanged). <BR>Lvl 56 Retribution of Al'Kabor: 15 debuff against magic, 5.0 cast time (unchanged). <BR>Lvl 59 Vengeance of Al'KAbor: 25 debuff against cold, 5.0 cast time (unchanged). <P>3) Claim for Wizard Rains<BR>------------------------------------<BR>Gameplay peril: the capacity of Rains to stack 3 hits on the same mob makes them "a bit too good" at replacing DD.<BR>Main inherent nerf negating the peril: easy resistance making it hard to stack 3 successful hits on the same mob.<BR>Additional major inherent nerf: cap of 4 generated hits, so that only one mob has a chance of being hit 3 times (but a cap of 5 hits would have ensured the same). Pre-50 Rains have the lowest potential of all AE spells to multiply DD damage.<BR>Additional inherent nerf: 4 successful hits are needed to earn a consistent damage/mana bonus versus DD, and it's very hard because of the resistance (but 3 hits give a bonus post-50).<BR>Additional minor inherent nerf: you can hurt yourself with the spell.<BR>Additional minor inherent nerf: the longest recast time of all AE spells (12 seconds).<BR>False nerf: the "pet bug". This is a problem for Magicians, not Wizards. I don't mind if Verant reprograms all the AE spells so that they ignore friendly pets; but I'm not asking for it.<BR>Result from a player's point of view: as soon as you accept to view Rains as hybrids of AE and DD, rather than genuine AE (it took me some time), there is nothing wrong with the above, after all, provided that there is a prize to gain in the lottery, and the prize is SIZE. The valued Wizard Rains (level 4 Icestrike, and post-50 Tears) are able to markedly outdamage DD on 1 mob when stacking 2 hits. The despised Wizard Rains (level 12, 24, 29, 34 and 44) can't do that. <P>Fix demand (very simple one): <BR>Resize the level 12-44 Wizard Rains (+30-50% to damage, mana and aggro, depending on the spells) so that they outdamage the same-rank DD on 1 mob when stacking 2 hits. They will still not perform as genuine AE (they would need to generate additional hits for that), and they will not become as popular as the post-50 Rains (because the pre-50 Rain damage/mana is mediocre), but they will become somewhat RESPECTABLE hybrids of AE and DD. The cast time can optionally be longer too (all the damage is not immediate anyway, and we don't use Rains if we are in a hurry; but, if the example of post-50 Rains is to be followed, the present cast times can be kept). <P>Lvl 12 Firestorm: 42 damage (28x1.5) for 93 mana (62x1.5) and optionally 3.7 cast time (2.5x1.5). Note: 2x42 outdamages DD by 8% at lvl 12, and 4% at lvl 15. <BR>Lvl 24 Lightning Storm: 98 damage (75x1.3) for 178 mana (137x1.3) and optionally 4.7 cast time (3.6x1.3). Note: 2x98 outdamages DD by 16% at lvl 24, and 8% at lvl 28. <BR>Lvl 29 Energy Storm: 134 damage (96x1.4) for 227 mana (162x1.4) and optionally 5.7 cast time (4.1x1.4). Note: 2x134 outdamages DD by 13% at lvl 29, and 8% at lvl 33. <BR>Lvl 34 Lava Storm: 173 damage (128x1.35) for 270 mana (200x1.35) and optionally 6.1 cast time (4.5x1.35). Note: 2x173 outdamages DD by 13% at lvl 34, and 7% at lvl 38. <BR>Lvl 44 Frost Storm: 333 damage (250x1.33) for 415 mana (312x1.33) and optionally 7.3 cast time (5.5x1.33). Note: 2x333 outdamages DD by 10% at lvl 44, and 7% at lvl 48. <P>Nicolbolas, Karana</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here is a couple of answers which were given to my post above before the board was cleared:<BR>---------------------------------------------------------------<P>fatherjimbeaux<BR>Station Member  posted 07-31-2000 10:15 PM <P>First let me comment you Nic for you intellegent, well thought out, and obviously time consuming effort to point out the problems of this line of spells. Everyone should at least acknowlege that. <BR>Also, anyone that refutes his logic just hasn't looked at his post without bias. He has laid it out in black and white (weird orange and dark green). This line of spells is just not effective. Also I can't understand why people always justfy it by bringing up the actual area of effect. The way I see it that doesn't enter into the equation becuase the maximum number of mobs effected remains constant. Sure if you could effect 20 mobs then it might make an impact. <BR>Read his editorial without bias and you will see what I mean. That said I would also like to say that it was Nic alone that made me decide on my final character choise. The wizard. I figure with an argument as well thought out and researched as much as this one will have to get a responce sometime. <BR>Finally I have a request. Let's try to keep the thread on topic and avoid any flaming or troll-like behavior. In other words, act like adults. <BR>Thanks,<BR>Aldreas<BR>E'ci <P>---------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>memberofbrell<BR>Station Member  posted 07-31-2000 10:48 PM <P>Great post. Too bad it will be ignored just like my post about rain efficiency. Here's another idea for rains, Make them single target only, and cut in 1/4 the damage and mana cost <P>-------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>dravon<BR>Station Member  posted 08-01-2000 03:46 AM <P>fatherjimbeaux/Aldreas,<BR>thanks for the homage... :-) It's funny to find out that one has, er, disciples !<BR>/bow <P>memberofbrell,<BR>I read the same idea in another topic yesterday; it was from a level 55 Wizard. I was surprised, because the level 51+ Rains are said to be good (large and mana-efficient enough to compensate for the high resistance). I believe that single-target Rains is a solution for Magicians ("pet bug"), not for Wizards ("level 12-44 Rains too mild").<BR>Decreasing the size of the level 12-44 Rains while making them single-target (only 3 hits generated with high resistance) would make them much weaker than before. The only advantage, from a Wizard's point of view, would be that the Rain could be cast in a mob crowd, and the hits would remain concentrated on one mob and not not get diluted in the crowd... So what. Personally I prefer that Rains remain hybrids between DD and AE (not surprising, since I am fond of AE). If the "hybridation" mix is to be changed, then strengthen the AE dimension, instead of removing it: 6 hits instead of 4.<BR>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<P>(last-minute addition to that "single target Rain" idea running around on the board: obviously this is due to 51-59 Wizards feeling incomplete without new large DD. But it is yet unproven whether this lack is a "sound challenge" or makes their life "excessively hard", such as not finding groups. The only fact I know of which markedly tends to make the lives of 51-59 Wizards harder than before is the fact that many mobs can Summon, and this has little to do with the spell book. 51-59 Wizards should feel free to argue and claim large DD, but please don't mutilate the 52+ Rains to "help" them serve as slow large DD; they are good spells with original mechanics, and should not be tampered with. Find other ways to shine, or claim something else. Nicolbolas, Karana)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>From other topics, it seems that, although AE damage becomes shining post-50, the overall condition of a Wizard post-50 is bad, and it isn't worth levelling up. It seems that the ratio "Wizard direct damage generated by full mana bar / average hit points of a high blue mob" gets so terrible post-50, that Wizards become "baggage" in a group.<P>Awful AE in the 40s, awful DD in the 50s...

This spell line is utter trash, you will not find a single set of spells that results in such a single mind about anything as Wizards have about Al'Kabor.  This is supposedly the legacy of the most powerful Wizard in the history of Norrath, and everyone considers the name of Al'Kabor in utter contempt.<P>Certainly something like this should be looked into, this spell line is unrequited crap.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Cauthon:<BR>He he, didn't this developer try to make a fool out of you ? If I understand well, you mean that revamping pre-50 AE would mean admitting that it was not in line with "contractual" promises, and post-50 Wizards who went through levels 1-50 the hard way (without enjoying that revamped AE) could sue Verant for not having kept its part of the "contract" ?<BR>He he this is crazy, but, you know, it is said so much that Americans are crazy when it comes to law (and when I say "crazy" I mean something calling for fear, horror and despise, not something calling for pity and amusement).<BR>Anyway, from a moral standpoint, any mature high-level Wizard (but maybe American Wizards old enough to sue are not mature) would wish that the condition of lower-level Wizards be improved if possible. Only immature, gross, stupid people would wish that their successors endure the same hardships they did (or else "it's unfair" and they sue).<BR>There's a price to pay for the rewards of being pioneers, and I hope the pioneers realize it. They play a game which, although not beta-test, is NOT perfectly tuned, and maybe there will be later tunings which will not benefit them because they're too old; the rewards is they are the kings of Norrath, and their get their share of every new mob or zone before the others do. So they'd better not complain, they made their choice.<P>About the "bug" of Rains: no, "bug" is only a common saying. The "bug" isn't even only for Rains, but Rains are the spells most hurt by it. It is as follows: the game engine will treat pets as NPCs, when looking for mobs to affect with the AE spell. Pets are invulnerable, of course, but still the spell will attempt to hit them. And the spells (except PB spells) have a mob count: they can hit only that many mobs (or, in the case of Rains, generate only 4 hits on mobs). If a pet is "hit", it means one true mob won't be hit. In the case of Rains, the pet can eat up 2 of the 4 hits. But this is not a genuine "bug": only game engine mechanics conflicting with the mob count of spells. Gordon made to Grimstaff an acid answer 2 months ago, promising nothing (especially not any ETA). I have a different opinion, I don't thing the "pet bug" is an issue for Wizards (level 12-44 Rains would be useless even without "bug"), but rather an issue for Magicians.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Actually that isn't the bug referred to, its not the one that GZ said needed to be fixed.  The pet thing is the only part that Gordon responded to, because he only understood and cared about the parts that applied to him apparently.<P>AE rain spells damage up to 4 targets with 3 separate packets, or "waves" of damage each target.  This should, by anyone's math, end up with 12 total waves (3x4).  However, the spells are presently broken in that they will only give 4 waves of damage maximum no matter HOW many targets that are available:<P>1 target = 3 waves of damage<BR>2 targets = 2 waves of damage each target<BR>3 targets = 1 wave of damage each target and 1 extra wave of damage on one target<BR>4 targets = 1 wave of damage on each target.<P>In other words, the more targets you have under your AE Rain spell, the less powerful it becomes.  This has been known by Verant for 8 months now.<P>Now Al'Kabor is another story entirely, and Nicolbolas covered it well above.  Basically they cost too much mana and do too little damage, for the poorest mana/damage ratio of any AE spell, even lower than spells a circle before them in total damage.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>He he, Grim, there is nothing wrong "per se" in a hit count of 4 for Rains, although it would be COOLER if they generated 12 hits. Of course, the hits would have to be smaller than they are presently (except maybe for the level 12 Firestorm; it is so much offset by Shock of Lightning that, even if given 12 hits with the current damage per hit, the spell would be barely interesting). I would sign gladly for "12 smaller hits", provided that the spell has about the same effectiveness it has now on 2 targets (i.e. the damage from 3 new smaller hits should be the same as the current damage from 2 hits, i.e. the current damage per hit should not be cut by more than a third). With 12 smaller hits, the Rains would be less effective than before on 1 target, as effective as now on 2 targets, and more effective than now on 3 or 4 targets. By the way, it is not clear whether the hit count is "per wave", or only on a total basis. Maybe, if the hit count was brought to 12, the spell would be able to hit 12 creatures at once in the first wave.<BR>But there is nothing ESSENTIALLY wrong with a hit count of 4, it all depends on how Verant wants the Rains to perform. Currently they perform as hybrids of DD and AE, that is, spells best used on 1 or 2 mobs. I have come to think "why not, provided that the overall damage and damage/mana is good enough", but I sure would prefer Rains performing more as AE.<BR>Oh, and, also, if Verant thinks that Al'Kabor spells are good, then Verant also thinks that Rains are good spells when used on 4 mobs. Crap thinking, but obvious.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Svalbard5, your post is ignorant and irrelevant. We have never complained about our Column spells. But they represent less than a quarter of our AE damage spell repertoire. OK, they have a special potential for quad kiting, so what ? Must we be punished for that, by means of the other spells being bad ? I am not asking for any fix for PB spells either, because the line also has a special potential, although the various PB spells are very uneven. And the fixes which I am asking for regarding Al'Kabor and Rains will not give them ANY potential similar to the potential of Columns or of the best PBs - the fixes will just make Al'Kabor and Rains barely playable casually, in group.<P>Grimstaff, he he, I could never read GZ's post stating that the Rains were broken; I'd like to see an exact dated copy of the text. As for the Rains "working fine" for the NPCs... You know very well that it isn't supposed to reflect what happens when players cast the spells. Even as a general principle, NPCs can do a lot of things which we can't, and we can do a lot of things which NPCs can't. The AE spells affect players without limitation of number (this is true also in PvP, not only in NPC-vs-player), and affect a limited number of NPCs (including pets, but this is another matter).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>After all, Svalbard5's post makes me feel like saying something which I never said before: Verant did an enormous blunder regarding Columns in early 2000. Wizards had been claiming about their AE since mid-1999, and Verant "addressed the issue" in a very frustrating Verant-like way in early 2000, by means of augmenting the radius of the spells instead of fixing the essential stats. This "fix" didn't make the worst spells the slightest bit better (Al'Kabor, Rains), but I believe it tipped the scale of Columns (who were fair already and didn't need a fix) from "rather unreliable in quad kiting" to "rather reliable in quad kiting" (unless the Columns didn't get a radius increase, but I think they did, as did the other spells). Considering that I'm 100% sure that Al'Kabor spells were deadly nerfed in damage/mana right from the start in order to AVOID easy quad kiting (most probably because the original game designers thought that easy quad kiting was not desirable in the game), I would say that the radius fix of early 2000 was not only frustrating as far as Al'Kabor and Rains (and possibly the weakest PB) are concerned, but also a terrible gameplay blunder as far as Columns are concerned. Now, quad kiting with Columns still isn't as easy as the occasional witness may think.<P><BR>Folks, I am leaving, for 2 weeks of mountaineering and scuba diving.

</FONT><HR>I'd like to see a reply from Verant on this. In my early teens I was in a party for a number of hours, fighting orcs in Oasis. Though it would sometimes result in my getting pummled a bit (though the party was watching for it and VERY quick to respond) I used nothing but AoE Column and Rain spells (Frost and Fire respectively if I remember correctly) and root on the mobs that would agro me if I could get it off. Lots of fun. How often have I used AoE since then? Columns in controlled specific planned circumstances. That's it. Useless otherwise IMHO.<P>Jjiaah Cometcast<BR>Nameless Souls<BR>The Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Given that Verant is not wanting to change class balance directly I think that 'fixing' AE rains is a good way to improve things since it helps any AE rains using class. I don't understand why AE rains cant work as listed here(I picked an easy example):<P>http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spelldescriptions.asp?Id=533<P>The rains only become powerful if you hit 3-4 MOBS with them AND they don't move AND you don't suffer major resists. This should make them perfect for groups as a slower yet more powerful form of damage than DD/bolts.<BR>I'm sure I've seen it mentioned that they worked like this a some point before(Al'Kabor line was worth using at one point too I hear) and I get the feeling that they were changed to stop those damn KSing 'wizards'. With rules in place against KSing why is this a problem? If the spells themselves were too powerful why not just remove them and put in something else?<BR>If Verant do consider improving/fixing AE rains then as a balance they could double casting time or somthing along those lines.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Im almost 39, halfway in to 38 because I've been crankin at xps at the expense of fun (you see that Verant?).  The AE spells we get at 1, 16, and 35 are the only lines I have found useful so far.  That is a pretty sick range of spells between there, especially considering it looks like it goes to level 49 before there is another I'd want to use regularly.<P>All you really have to do is look at regular use, ESPECIALLY FROM PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO LIKE AREA EFFECT.  That tells you all you need to know about the validity and problems in the spells.  I know you don't want to work on anything for Wizards I know you probably don't much care for me, Abashi, I know that Verant has a blind spot when it comes to this class, but AREA EFFECT IS MORE THAN JUST A WIZARD ISSUE.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm a 32 wizard and am basically happy with being a wiz.  I really look forward to post 50 when I can start using AOE's as a significant part of my arsenal.  The thing that changes most interestingly post 50 is the AE max damage to the current best DD ratio.  Post 50 some of the AE's (particularly the rains) have such good damage compared to the best DDs that they become very desirable to use, even with extra resists factored in.  <P>Why does this bestAE/bestDD damage ratio suddenly drastically increase post 50?  If there was a similar ratio at the pre-50 levels AE's would be used far more frequently.  This would likely enrich the entire gaming experience for all since it might get characters more familiar with AE group strategies at pre-50 levels.<P>IMHO, max damage is the most important factor in measuring utility of AE at all levels.  If the spell does significant damage, the party can figure out ways around the Z-axis and pet-damaging issues.<P>cheers,<BR>Asiago<BR>The Seventh Hammer   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I add these to my original post (I wanted to make the claim "minimal", but still...):<P>- Give pre-50 Rains +5% damage/mana, by means of mana cost reduction versus my resized proposals in the original post,<P>- Fix the "pet bug" of Rains. This was an almost-only-Magician issue before, but now the high-level Wizards want it too (by the way, we now have the proof that the game engine can exclude player pets from the count, because player pets were recently excluded from the effect of "sense" spells such as Sense Summoned). But if the bug is fixed, I won't notice it, someone will have to tell me (I never had trouble with it up to level 37... Because I don't use the Rains and I don't experiment with them that often anymore). Fix the "pet bug", but in addition to my fix demands in the original post, not instead of them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The problem here is getting them to recognize and admit that the Al'Kabor line isn't worth it.  The mana cost and damage is terrible, and their idea of the balancing factor (extra range, area, and targets hit) just doesn't work out in any actual player's experience to be worth it.<P>First, take a look at Al'Kabor spell lines and compare them to damage of other AE spells (incidentally some of your numbers are off, Nicolbolas):<P>Lvl 12 Frost Spiral: 44 damage for 100 mana.<BR>Lvl 8 AE Pillar of Fire: 31 damage for 39 mana.<BR>Lvl 12 AE Firestorm: 3x28 (84 damage) for 62 mana.<P>Lvl 20 Fire Spiral: 76 damage for 175 mana.<BR>Lvl 16 AE Pillar of Fire: 76 damage for 84 mana.<P>Lvl 29 Shock Spiral: 118 damage for 250 mana.<BR>Lvl 24 AE Column of Lightning: 136 damage for 130 mana. <P>Lvl 39 Force Spiral: 172 damage for 325 mana.<BR>Lvl 34 AE Circle of Force: 216 damage for 175 mana<P>Lvl 49 Wrath of Al'Kabor: 448 damage for 500 mana.<BR>Lvl 44 AE Frost storm: 3x250 damage for 312 mana.<P>You can see there is a considerable discrepency in damage and mana cost between even spells a full circle lower than the Al'Kabor line.<P>Let's examine the benefits of Al'Kabor and why players don't see them as being worth the crappy mana/damage ratio:<P>-Increased Area: while this is nice, it is rarely even useful.  So rarely, in fact, that no one keeps an Al'Kabor spell memorized.  Since controlling the opposition is so critical in a game where blues can murder you and it takes hours to get your xps back, having scattered foes mad at you isn't a very clever idea.  Useful only for taking out camps of deep greens.<P>-Increased Range: This is useful, the only really handy thing the spell has.  However, take a look at Bolt spells and calculate how much more mana their 50% extra range costs?<P>-Increased maximum targets: Again, this is rarely useful, unless against lots of greens because angering a larger number of blues is exceptionally dangerous.  The only time you care about large numbers of creatures is if they are very, very green (a third your level or less) or you are using Point Blank because you can control the location and stun them all with Enchanters.<P>-Pushback/stun effect: Al'Kabor spells all have a slight pushback effect like Shock of Lightning, which can interrupt casting.  While this seems like a good thing, how many times do you have a situation where there are more than one caster at range from you?  If you do, Circle of Force is a better choice, because it is significantly better in mana to damage and does the same thing.<P>The last problem with Al'Kabor spells is that they hurt YOU if you are in the area, and as such, are useless for anything but your opening salvo in almost every situation.<P>ALL of this adds up to make them crap.  I know what happened when they were made, GZ and his programming staff (or whoever originally came up with the spells) sat down and wrote the spells up.  They looked at AE and thought up this extra large shocking AE and decided it was worth more mana, and when AE nerf came in late beta lowering max targets and area of all of them (and damage), Al'Kabor looked like it was even more awesome.  So they gave it a different cost based on whim or a complex formula.<P>The problem is, IN PLAY they end up being useless.  Not nearly useless, not kind of annoying and limited... useless.  The only time any Wizard uses these spells is out of ignorance or against very green things.  That is it.  This uniform, unanimous contempt for the spell line and as a result the "mightiest Wizard in Norrath's history" Al himself are truly stunning in light of the fact that we are told repeatedly that these spells are fine as is.  They are NOT fine.<P>Incidentally I started a new thread with this post, too often later posts are ignored by Abashi because he is too busy with other stuff to read the whole thread.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have used the Alkabor line of spells only once. I leveled to 50 before all the AE changes ever took place. I basically just ignored those lines of spells cause they never were of any use except that one time, when I needed to clear rathyl's room of the 4 magicians, the 600 dmg that alkabor spell did took them all out so I can avoid having to fight their pets too. That was the best use I ever got out of it. Notice I can't even remember the name of the alkabor spell cause I still don't use them, or any pre 50 AE. Uterly useless, even the column spells are not worth the aggravation pre level 50. As for that Rogue that stated he can't solo a mob 10 levels below him. I just saw a rogue the other day solo a blue mob without even getting past half health. With his equipment he was barely even getting hurt and doing alot of fast damage. Wizards die when they quad kite, they  usually team up with other wizards to ensure sucess. As for soloing... ever see a level 51 necro solo a wurm? Wizards pale in comparison. In places like sebilis, I usually am just a evac back up, incase the druid is asleep. I barely do enough damage to put a dent on seb frogs at all, I tried emptying all of my mana into one, and managed to take the frog to 2/3 of its health.. The cleric wasted all her mana healing me btw, but it was only a test. I for one would like to see a improvement on alkabor spells to make them a little more useful or rains to make them the way they are supposed to be, or a comprimise between what we have now and what it should be.<BR>Im not asking for total power for a wizard, but some use out of spells that have been collecting dust since level 8, when I first got them, and used it, and got clobbered by goblins.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
