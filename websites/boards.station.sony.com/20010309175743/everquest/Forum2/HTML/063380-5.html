</FONT><HR>Sort of been a strange night for me ...hehe.<P>I spent half the night defending FoH, even though I dont know any of them .. hehe. I had lots of ppl logging on from other servers comming to tell me this or that occured in FoH .. hehe. Ive had 7 ppl from other servers come onto Povar tonight while I was trying to work on the site, and tell me that FoH recieved inside help. <P>Can someone from FoH please deny that you have anyone on your team that does or did work for VI development team and may have recieved insider info.<P>I personally belive that considering FoH's past accomplishments that they simply had a better perspective on EQ in general, and as such did NOT get inside info.<P>Triton is planning another guild raid up there in the near future, to see if by killing the larger NPC's that I cant solo, if different cards are dropping that we have not seen yet ...<P>If other cards are dropping, I imagine that we must be missing something in the zone ... As a guild I imagine that we have about 75 cards so far, only 2 jesters, maybe 10 crowns, 25 knights and the remaining majority are squires. There are some area's like the Blue room that we never spend any time on because the entire area does not seem to have any NPC's, invisible NPC's or any moving parts or clickable areas. It's sort of like a huge area with empty rooms and long hall ways. <P>I did find a first tonight. Up until tonight I had never seen anything bot squires cards drop off the "yard trash", from the forrest people, but tonight I found a black knight on one .. nothing to exciting but new to me. I had found a knight b4 on the treasure chest, but not off the shroom ppl. All this means is that the Knights can be found on the loot tables for the Shroom ppl. <P>Just to let ppl who logged on to Povar tonight know, I plan on continuing work on PoM till we can at least give the basics behind the quests and how they work. 8-)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Believe it, jackhole...because sadly it's true.<P>There is nothing more to this zone then: hack/slash, farm cards... <P>Anyways, I'm sure the zones been patched several times since Triton was first there, and Verant added some more cards... OR made them extremely ass ****ing rare.  <P>But, I will say this: You will get absolutely NO WHERE by trying to solve gay dick riddles.  There is none, nada, zip.<P>And also, I think its great that Irontail has spent alot of his own time working to crack this zone.

</FONT><HR>So let me see if I correctly understand...<BR>1: FoH solves PoM by itself, with no help from anyone else and after they decide the zone is worthless, just happen to stumble across this thread?<P>2: After finding 1 item, decide the zone is worthless...thats like zoning into Crystal Caves, looting the 10hp globe, and saying "well this zone has lame loot". How can you judge the zone one week of play and a few of the FIRST pieces of eq you find?<P>3: So this zone is deemed worthless by FoH. Great! Then why not share what you have found, since you do not care about staying there or working on it? Because you know you have not done everything? Or because it would take away from your uberness to have triton solve the zone before you?<P>I really see 3 possibilities:<BR>- zone sucks like foh says<BR>- zone does not suck, and foh is working 24/7 to figure it out before triton (and posting to discourage them)<BR>- foh and everyone else know little of this zone<P>assuming the first is true: why not help the "little guys" and prove your uberness, since this zone means nothing to you? assuming the second is true, triton is already on the map for figuring out how to get there, all the glory FoH could possibly hope to get is solving some quests, with everyone fully knowing they are following this thread and not working independently. in reality, i believe the last one to be true...the surface has only been scratched.<P>I am looking for real answers from FoH members to the above questions, not flames (as this post is not a flame but questions and concerns I am sure lots of people have).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There is also a simple possibility that I fear may be true .. 8-(<P>It is a very simple zone and when we got there and started the simplist ideas first that they would have worked, but alas did not because something was broke, but was fixed b4 FoH got up there and as such ... we tried passed over the answers 8-(<P>If it is as simple as turning in cards to some NPC like the 8 halflings in the main hall and they give a reward, that was done the first 2 days b4 and after the patch that said PoM was patched. After we turned in all 10 cards to all the halflings we would not have back tracked and tried it again, based on the theory that they would have eaten the cards if they could have used them. 8-(<P>This means it is possible that something we tried should have worked, but because it may not have worked when we tried it and was fixed after it ... Ughh ... ok Im going to be sick now ..hehe 8-(<P>Triton is on the verge of heading back to PoM. I can not solo the halflings the last time I tried, unlike Coladar, I get multiples that join up. I will try again tonight and eat a few deaths trying to see if I can get them alone. If I can I'll return in all cards to them, if I cant I'll have to wait till Triton gets up here maybe by this weekend. The Jester cards are to rare to waste if we can not get them back. 8-(<P>FoH I can understand your not wanting to give any hints, can you say this ... you've seen the maps that Sep and Coladar did. With the exception of the long hall where the Blue room is .... Did we miss a section? A floor or something? ..

</FONT><HR>I am having trouble believing FoH found anything as well.  <P>I don't think there is any guild in the game that would crack a zone like PoM, figure it out, get one item, then decide, "this item sucks, lets blow this joint".  <P>I agree with the person who used the Crystal Cavern example.  Every zone, has something that "sucks", it's just a matter of finding the good stuff.  Maybe the Vambraces are part of another quest in the zone.<P>Oh well, on a side not.  The bandits in Greater Fay give negative Fizzlethorp faction when they are killed.  That is the only Fizzlethorp faction that I know about in the game.  Good or Bad.

Much as I dislike their idea of having folks like Irontaail and myself stay up here because something that was tried when the zone was broken actually works now, they sure as **** aren't ones to BS people. <P>If they had inside help or not, who knows. None of us can say for a fact that they did or didn't. At least we do know exactly what type of rewards can be expected, narrowing the search a bit. We know there will be roughly four types of armor, which certainly points to those little things in the main room.  I certainly don't see anything else in the zone that would give four different rewards via turning in the cards...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think Fuuh is selling the whole thing short a bit. When you solve the initial puzzle, you wont go 'duh'. Its somewhat far from obvious in any sense. As far as it being implemented after your initial trip, I doubt it. Im reasonably certain that no one else has tried this, and Id be surprised if anyone solves it soon without a spoiler or info leak. Something clicked, I got kind of lucky, and wala, done. Its kinda weird and there's maybe 3-4 clues in the zone about what to do... However, once you solve that, then its very obvious what to do; which is I think what Fuuh was referring to.<P>As for the zone 'sucking' or not being worth it, I think people misinterpreted the intent of my post. Its a FUN zone... at first... a real headtrip. Just like any zone in EQ, camping mobs for very rare drops gets old fast. The arms are a NICE item, best non warrior arms around. We just don't think they were worth the time investment when compared to say PoG, ToV, Kael, etc. Did we have fun? Yes. Will we spend a lot of time there again in the near future if its not changed? Probably not.<P>And we aren't going to spoil it just because people don't believe us, or think we got info from this thread/others. When it does eventually get figured out by someone else, you'll see that it's nothing CLOSE =) There's some great stuff here, but, like others have said... remember, this is Everquest - and they're not recoding the game for a zone.<P>Good luck seekers of Bristlebane's fortune,<P>Verm<BR>Lilya Gubbin; sanctioned halfling<BR>Fires of Heaven</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>At this point I guess I don't care who did what and how they did it. I'd just like get past this stupid blockage in the zone. Thank you for your post btw Verm, the other guys post sounded like some foul mouthed 12 year old that had to repeat a few grades in school because he was too busy trying to be a hip suburban "gangstah rappah". It left a foul taste about FOH in general. I was starting to think it was a collection of morons that haven't yet learned to speak english as opposed to Ebonics. Probably a better idea for you to do the posting on your guilds behalf as a person that comes across with at least a normal demeanor. : )<P>Grats on solving it. Hope I'm lucky enough to stumble on it soon. Starting to get bored of collecting and handing in cards to test things and lose them all when the mob poofs while you're killing it. Out of curiosity why didn't you guys try to collect more items? Seems silly to bail after one item.<P>As for a few clues in the zone pointing to what to do wish I could figure this out : ).  Only things in the zone I can think of that really do anything are the Sphinx in the garden, the bixie etc. telling you to shut your yap in library areas and Bristlebane yapping about his Cazic puppet. I suppose Rissa as well.

</FONT><HR>Yeah, Ester's test could conceivably have been faster, except for one problem.<P>Using the shortcut method (summoning the items) is exactly what's got them into so much trouble before.<P>The test server is not the same as the live server, and doing something by skipping steps is not the same as doing all the steps.<P>For example, it's entirely possible that there are cards that are supposed to drop that don't, or that don't drop nearly as often as they're supposed to.  If Ester just summoned the cards, that could still be happening and she wouldn't have a clue.<P>One would like to think that Verant learns from past mistakes, although most of the time, I'm quite sure they don't.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My Hats off to you Iron for the time and effort you have put into trying to solve the quest, I would have to say that FOH had some inside help which is a sad comment to say the least.<P>Then to come and post and say we figured it out the zone sucks, don't waste your time, well to begin with the vambraces they found are nothing to sneeze at by any means..so seems to me they figured out one part of it and are working on the rest to attain a full set of armor. Now if I had figured it out and found the vamps don't you think I would continue to search to complete a set of armor??<P>Anyway if they have, I do believe it is probably not all that hard to figure out based on the fact of VI record in such matters, remember Ester did say don't destory the cards,that was pre-patch maybe all the cards weren't in the game and maybe they were and it was partly broken and since post patch they have fixed it retry a few things u did before and see what happens.<P>I'm sure you have looked at this already but a couple of post up you listed the cards you had found so far.<P>3 different set of cards all the same except for color and the one jester card we all know thier is 4 of each suit in a deck of cards, in this case thier are 3 colors with the jester being the wild card.<P>1- squire is the knights assistant<BR>2- knight only answers to the crown<BR>3- crown are the folks in charge<BR>4- jester is for the crowns amussment<P>take the colors that match along with the jester and turn them into the specific npc, maybe one dressed in blue or whatever. Or maybe the npc that cons red and hits for 1 point of dmg red cards match the red con, blue cards match the blue con and if you have and even con well you know the rest of the story.<P>But I do very much respect what you have done and the time you have put forth in the effort to solve it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">, I did however love the shakspearen idea..

</FONT><HR>I know this was suggested already, but just try it: beg from Geb. I don't know what your begging skill is (mine is 200 muahaha hehe), but if it doesn't work just work the skill up. You can do it while fighting. Set it up in one of the hotboxes or whatever they're called, and hit "a" then the number of the box, then "a" again, all really fast. That way you won't miss out on an attack and you'll work up beg with no extra time added. Hey, and maybe what you're supposed to do is beg from him so much that he gets annoyed, but instead of attacking you says something special, or he attacks and you kill him and get something... I dunno, just try it. =P<P><BR>Talladar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063380-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063380.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063380-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063380-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063380-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063380-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=063380&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=063380&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
