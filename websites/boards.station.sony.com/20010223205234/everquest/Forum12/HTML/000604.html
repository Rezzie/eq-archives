</FONT><HR>Before I begin, let me just say that I don't normally read these boards, so I'll only be reading and checking this post for the next week or so.<P>Enchanters are over-powered at 50+.  Can anyone disagree with this?  If so, stop reading, because I really don't even want to hear what you have to say.  Now that we have that over with, let's get down to my point.  I am a full-fledged math nerd so get ready for a post that reads like a physics problem.  Enchanters are over-powered because they have four of the most important needs of a group - mana regen, slow spells, haste spells, and crowd control.<P>The clarity and haste spells are too obvious to be looked at.  Everyone knows why they're good, how good they are, and how that makes enchanters over-powered and overly desired.  Let's get to the meat of the issue, though.  What is that?  The absolute NEED for enchanters due to crowd control and slows.  Why are these two things NEEDED at 50+?  That's the issue at hand.  So here we go.<P>Back in the old days of level 20 enchanters sucked.  They were nearly useless because mezzing mobs was a waste of time.  You just got the tanks in there tanking everything while the casters nuked one or two down as fast as possible to lower the overall damage done by the mobs.  Drop a few really fast, and you can survive.  What happens today at 50+?  Well, in Sebilis if you have 3 mobs come attack and you don't have a crowd control you run or evac.  The fact is that no tank/cleric combo could stand up to 3-4 mobs without any form of slows or crowd control.  Why?  What happened?<P>The key ---&gt;&gt;  TANKS CAN'T TANK ANYMORE<P>Tanks simply can't take damage anymore.  Remember back when warriors could solo nearly anything that was blue?  Not anymore.  If it doesn't con green, they aren't messing with it.  Even then they are very, very wary.  But how does this affect enchanters?  It makes them necessary.  If an enchanter mezzes two Sebilis mobs they are preventing an enormous amount of damage that would be devastating to the tanks and the cleric's mana (which means it would be devastating to the group in general since cleric mana is the heart of the group).  The same holds true for slows.  Without slows in some good groups it would take 1/3 of the cleric's mana to kill a single blue mob.  At level 20 in Mistmoore, the enchanter is preventing unwanted, but fully tolerable damage.  Yes, it's helpful and warrants the enchanter's place in the group, but you know what?  The group would live on if the enchanter left.  Everyone knows what happens when an enchanter leaves a Sebilis group - you leave.<P>The point --&gt;&gt; Enchanter power is directly (and probably linearly) related to the power of the mobs in relatioin to the tanks.  (i.e. the less the tanks can tank, the more powerful the enchanters get).<P>There is also a linear relation between the normal speed at which casters med and the necessity of enchanters due to their clarity spells, but we won't discuss that further.<P>What other effects does this have on the game and its players?  Obviously it has any and all effects you can imagine due to every group after Karnor's basically REQUIRING an enchanter to do anything.  If you do anything in Sebilis except exit or guardian without an enchanter, you'd better have a bunch of 60's in the group (specifically the puller).  But what other effects are there?  Let's take a peek at the casters (mages and wizards more specifically).<P>What was the roll of mages and wizards back in mistmoore at level 20?  When you get 3-4 mobs, killed 1-2 of them right away to get the fight under control and managable.  They were darn good at it too, I would say.  What is the roll now?  Nothing, really.  Mages do damage efficiently with that monster pet, and wizards evac.  Nukes have no place anymore.  Nukes don't bring the fight to a controllable level by eliminating mobs quickly.  Crowd control is how you survive a hard fight.  Simply turn the mobs off until you're ready to deal with them, because you simply can't tank them long enough for the now-less-effective nukers to bring a few down.<P><BR>Now for my opinions -- I hate enchanters.  I loathe them.  I just can't STAND that if you don't have a cleric and an enchanter in the group, you simply don't have a group.  Yes, there are measly, pathetic alternatives that give you a total second-rate, worthless group.  Who wants that, though?  I'm sure everyone has gotten to experience those high-and-mighty clerics and enchanters who just do what they want, come and go as they please, and dictate because they know everyone else is at their mercy.  They ditch groups on a whim because they know other groups are just drooling at the thought of being able to invite them.<P>Verant, you are looking into fixing the hybrids or the wizards or whatever.  Look no further than fixing the enchanters.  They are RUINING EverQuest, and most people don't notice.  The only way to fix them is to *buff the tanks*, guyz.  Don't start handing their abilities to other classes, make the less necessary.  Make the tanks more than just casters with lots of HPs.  Make them TANK better.  Make them be able to stand up to 3 mobs for a little while.  Make the casters nuke HARD again and burn those mobs down in just a few mana-costly seconds.  Fix it, guyz, cuz EQ is being destroyed by these problems.  I would just LOVE a response from one of you guys at Verant.  Send me an E-Mail, i beg you.  I could play e-mail ping pong for months with you on this issue or talk your ear off for hours on the phone.  Let's get a little interaction going here, because I doubt many people would disagree that this makes sense.<P><BR>-(Character name and server omitted)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>To Twipple,<P>Wow, man! All I can say is Ha Blooming Ha! You have never played an enchanter have you? And I don't mean playing one for a few lvls (or even up to the mid teens) and then switching to another character. I mean starting a new, UNTWINKED enchanter and going through the whole saga until you hit that precious lvl 50 (actually, lvl 34 wasn't bad either!). <P>I have done the hard yards, and I almost fainted when I read your post! Although, I will say that I respect your opinion, and I do know of some enchanters that abuse their usefulness. I am not one of them. <P>If you dragged one of these high lvl 50 enchanters aside and asked him/her, you would hear some tales of sorrow and despair that would make your toes curl. His/her deaths would have been at least twice yours, the time taken to level at least twice yours, etc. We may have "all" the spells when we get that high but we certainly aint got em when we're growing up. Also, we get abused for asking too much for our jewellery (try jewelling up to 200, you'll understand the pricing methods then), pestered for breezes and abused when we can't run across the whole of WK when we say sorry we're busy. As you say in your post, enchanters aren't vital to a group when young, even in the 20's. Now, remember all those times when you were growing up and saw /ooc's asking for an extra group member? They nearly always asked for a tank or healer. The amount of times I got knocked back because a group had one spot to fill, and a choice between me or a healer, nuker, or tank. Man, I should have reached lvl 50 in half the time I did!<P>Now that I am high lvl (54 actually), I freely claritize, bind, invis, hasten, etc people as I pass, and give /ooc advice when I can. BUT, I fully respect loyalty. In the time it has taken me to get this high, I have made a few friends. Probably less friends than other classes would make due to the patience it takes to help an enchanter grow. And because they have taken time out to help me progress in the nasty world of Norrath, they have essentially guaranteed themselves an enchanter whenever they want it. We have been in Old Sebilis and I have actually been abused by other players because I wouldn't leave my group to go and help another group "just for a minute or two"! It works both ways, Twip.<P>Hehe, essentially I see it as an "evening-up" of things to make up for the hardships we go through to get there. So, Twipple - suck up that pride and make friends with an enchanter, not enemies. Even better if you stay friends with one while he/she grows up. If you do, your life in Norrath may suddenly become much nicer!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Well lets see your "points" they're absolutley necesarry must have can't live without because they can<P>Haste- well so can shamans at one level less than enchanters and any decent tank would have at least one haste item by the time they were post 50<P>Slow- hmm Shamans are better at slowing post-50 (and a good deal of time before that as well.<P>Mana regen- I guess bards having a better group mana regen isnn't worth mentioning and theres really no point in showing that necros have their own mana regen line and can mana dump. especially useless to mention that atleast one of the druid wolforms acts as a weak version of clarity. Oh yeah those shamans can cannibalize (personal so I gguess it doesnn't count) That goes for wizard mana skin and harvest. I suppose mages mmodulation rod is a one shot deal that drains life. I guess your right besides Bards/shamans/necros/druis/wizards/mages there is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY to mana regen w/o an enchanter , hmm oh yeah there is that robe and stone that have a cannibalize effect on them. well your right here ;P<P>Crowd control- yup we're great at it! wait! we can't mez anything over 55 normally, well that unresistable one works great it is only about twice the mana for half the effect, I suppose high magic resistance (read failures bears no meaning) Lets take a seond to look at alternatives feign death pulling (only 3 classes have this though so you'll never see it). you can root park (mages don't have that spell so we're still overpowered) you could throw a pet at the mobe to hold it for a bit (but it would die and you would lose 2 silver! can't have that, lets' look at something else) you could fight a smaller spawn point, but why would anyone want to do that you would get less xp, and there's obviously no such place....Wait a sec you mentioned two right off the bat.<P>Tanks are way too eak to handle damage- ummm I personally know a warrior that can tank multiple 2-3 mobs at a time with the support oof one cleric who actually gains mana during the fight (I suppose no one has ever heard of complete heal?) <P>*please remove your fingers from your ears now*<P>I guess your right There is no way that ANYONE could possibly group w/o an enchanter, and they would be a fool not to BEG to group with and idiot...

</FONT><HR>Well, it would appear that there is a lot to answer to already, so let's get started...<P>Santosha....<P>Try reading the post before you respond, smart guy.  All classes have horror stories and things to cry about.  This is why I didn't even bother mentioning the class(es) that I play in the post.  I'm not saying that you guyz are an easy class to play or that you're easy to level up.  I'm saying that you're over-powered and that you're overly necessary.  Please respond to the things I said and take your whining post to another thread.<P><BR>Custodes....<P>Take the sarcasm elsewhere.  Also, try reading your post again.  Take a look at how many classes you have listed that have the four abilities in my original post.  Necros, bards, shamans, etc.  It takes all those classes to come up with less-effective substitutes for what you guys can do.<P>Speeds - shaman speed is far inferior to yours, but you forgot to mention bard speed.<P>Mana regen - yes, bards can improve mana regen even more than enchanters, but they can't keep it going all the time.<P>Crowd Control - root-mezzing doesn't work well when a wizard or druid has 1000 hps and the mobs do 250-300 dmg a round and rarely miss with their miserable AC.  Bards can do *some* crowd control (3 mobs max), but it requires all of their singing power so speeds and mana regen, etc are lost during that time.<P>Slows - everyone knows that you *need* slows unless you have just an uber tank.  Who has slows (discount bards cuz their slow is just aweful).  Shamans and enchanters.  Shaman slow is better, but not by a great deal.<P><BR>So, how do I retort to your rather insulting post?  Well, rather than being sarcastic and insulting in return I'll hand you some intelligence, and you're free to use it.  Think of how many classes are listed above and how many it would take to put together a decent replacement for an enchanter - you have to have a shaman because it's the only replacement for slows.  Add a bard so you have the mana regen and the slight crowd control factor.  Then add another bard to cover haste during the fight.  Now you're doing pretty good.  If you just have a rooting class with a little extra time (like a wizard) you can have someone to back up the CC bard in case he has some trouble.  Admittedly that would be about a perfect replacement for an enchanter.  How many characters was that?  2 bards, shaman, and wizard.  4.  Now you have room for 1 tank and a cleric.  But think about how hard it would be to put together such a specific group.  No, I'm getting bored already.  Anyone know an enchanter?<P>Kailyn-Phantasy.....<P>Lots of classes take skill to play.  I never said you guyz were easy to play at all.  Shadow Knights take skill to FD-pull, but no one in their right mind would argue that they are over-powered.<P>Everyone notice that all the people who posted here are quite biased due to the fact that every one of them claims to be an enchanter.  Can we get some other opinions here?  Surely others see how ridiculously high the demand is for clerics<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>   Ok, Twipple back down a little bit, you are somewhat ultra-hostile, but you have a couple valid points, in sebilis for any group to hold a point, rather than just pulling to zone and fighting until you have to run, an enchanter is required, they are the only reliable crowd control.  I play a bard, and must admit, that our cc is capable of keeping two mobs mezed, but one botched pull, or one nasty respawn and we are dead.  Bard haste is fairly decent, with a good haste item the tanks come close enough to the haste cap.  Bard mana regen is nice, it's better than c2 if we have the real cantanna, and it's better than c1 when we've got mansong.  <BR>As far as other classes mana regen, canabalise is good for the shaman, it's not usefull for the other classes.  Mod rods are not worth the time and health they cost by much.  Necros are nice, and somewhat under-rated, but they need their mana too, and what we are talking about is group mana regen.  <P>   Crowd control is a similar issue, there aren't any other good controllers, parking stuff with root may be enough better with the changes to snare, but before that it wasn't enough to get the job done.  Bard's crowd controll is very risky, and costly in terms of cleric mana, both because of the damage they take, and the loss of manasong while they do it.  Bards also lack the frequently essential ability to controll a bad pull long enough to save the puller, enchanters have ae spells that allow them to do that.  Necro mez is and option, but necromancers face many of the same problems, and if they are using their pet, mezing is almost impossible because of the way pets agro.  <P>   Haste is fine with a Shaman, or a Bard, but it is not quite as good as an Enchanter's, so that is not a requirement, except for the fact that if you have an enchanter you don't _need_ the other two, while if you have either of the other two you still _need_ an Enchanter.  <P>   Slows are also a big deal, they are the only prayer for a group without a cleric, and enchanters and shamans are the only classes with good ones, with a good slow, a tank can tank, without one, they can not.  <P>   In conlusion, enchanters are powerful enough at high levels that they allow for a group to go into areas that they can not go without a second group joining them, and they improve a group signifigantly more than any other class, with the possible exception of a cleric, due to the fact that shamans and druids are not good enough healers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Woo Hoo Twipple!<P>Thanks for the reply and acknowledging my 'whine'. Hehe, who was the person whining in the first place? Smart guy? I thought you said that you were the nerdy Smart Guy. The gloves are now off, I tried to respond in a semi-civil way but you saw it fit to have a go at me and my "whining". Mate, relax a bit. I dunno what you have against us, but you need to take a chill pill. So I'm whining by trying to reply to your point, from an Enchanter's point of view? It seems to me that you don't mind having an opinion but don't like it when someone doesn't agree with you. That horse that you're on is pretty high. Get off it!<P>Why not tell us what server and character you play so we can all ignore you? I bet that you never tell an enchanter who is grouping with you to leave, do you? I bet you don't run around saying "Looking for group, preferably no Enchanters please!" If you play any mana using characters, I bet you haven't said to an Enchanter "I don't want your stinking Breeze/Clarity". I wonder if you have ever had in your possession a piece of Enchanter created jewellery that has increased your stats, and it saved your life by adding that little extra HP, attack strength, mana, etc.<P>If I follow your line of thinking, I could legitimately complain that Warriors have more HP than me, Shamans can run faster than me, Rangers and druids can track mobs, Mages have better pets than me, Wizzies can nuke better than me, Bards don't need mana to have "spells", Necros can solo better than me, and so on. Live with it! Enchanters may be able to control crowds, but we can't kill them by ourselves. We NEED other characters too!<P>I'd love to meet you in-game, coz now that you have abused me (typical nerd who doesn't know how to interact with other people), I'd make your life a living hell. BTW My Enchanter is called Peat on the Bristlebane server. Come see me anytime, we'd love to have some bait we can throw to the mobs! Ever heard of Bind Sight? God, it can get annoying having a little person see your every move, and tell you all about it. Ever been intentionally trained? For hours on end? Hehe, now I'm starting to actually hope that you come to see me. This could be fun!<P>You sound like one of our customers at work. Too much idle time so you have to find something to whinge about! Just to make your life interesting. Notice how you didn't get many people agreeing with you? <P>Seeing that you're a Hell maths nerd, maybe you could make your own game called Twipplequest, where enchanters are the lowest form of pond scum and whatever character you play is the All Mighty crowd controller/nuker/tank/buffer. You could wear those rose coloured glasses so everything looks peachy-keen to you. You'd never have to have a server split, coz there would only ever be one player - you! Think about it, you could camp any mob you want, you could ask for groups that don't include enchanters, you could include all your little physics equations as quests, you could have as many linear relationships as you want, you wouldn't have to expose your social ineptitude by having to interact with other people. Sounds great doesn't it? Go on. Off you go.<P>Remember a certain German/Austrian with a funny moustache who had an opinion, and didn't want to hear from anyone who disagreed? Yeah, he called anyone who responed a whiner too, and killed them! I'm sorry buddy, but any viewpoint will have someone who opposes it - like me. That's the REAL WORLD. Physics formulas can't explain the workings of humans. <P>To all who read this and think that Twipple should go and play Twipplequest instead of Everquest - give me a HELL YEAH!!!<P>ENCHANTERS RULE!!!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Although, I see and understand some of your points there is one thing you seem not to realize. That Enc have a limited mana pool. Do you know what happens if I try to slow, speed, debuff etc. I have no mana left for my main job which is CC. Also you underestimate the diff between the Enc's slow line and the Shamans. When I slow the tank will need a CH more then likely, Shaman slows the tank will pry need a small heal. There is a large diff in the slow lines, you should look into it a bit more closely. Also, since you seem keen on Seb let me tell you I see groups going into Seb without Enc but you know what their are 2 classes that they won't set foot in there without. A CLERIC and a tank, I don't mean a meele player they have a full blown warrior, no ranger, no monk etc. So I think they should allow pallys CH's so Clerics are unneeded as well as giving all meele classes the HP/AC that warriors have. You say Enc are over powering but I say they are diverse because there is no way in hell I can run all the spells you think are great and have enough mana for a 'uh-oh' pull. Enc's have 3 things that they can do all of which are also done by other classes. The only thing the Enc excells in is what we were made for and that is CC. That is what we do the rest is just frosting on the cake for playing up the hardest damn casting class to play. My thoughts at least.  <BR>Oh and I must say HELL YA </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Santosha....<P>Thanks for displaying what a totally rediculous jerk-off you are, 'mate'.  Now I will feel much better about ignoring any further comments by you.<P><BR>Megdiinn....<P>Thanks for an intelligent post, friend.  I appreciate it.  Anyway, based on everything I see, hear, and read, the two highest level slow spells for the shamans and enchanters are so very close in speed reduction it's neglegible.  <P>As for the comment about clerics, I totally agree with you there.  They are just as bad as the enchanters as far as necessity in a group.  I just decided to focus on the enchanters in particular in this discussion.  Plus, you also have to admit that their necessity is partially based on the same weakness in the tanks that I am stating makes the enchanters so necessary.  So by executing my proposed solution, Verant would also be alleviating this issue a bit as well.<P>As for every group needing a tank, just listen to what you said, man.  Every group needs a TANK.  Not a warrior.  Not a Shadow Knight.  Not a Paladin.  You said TANK.  That covers several classes and a *vastly* larger number of available characters to group with.  If you had to have a WARRIOR specifically, I could see that this point was valid.  I mean, I could say every group needs a HEALER, but that wouldn't be valid because it could be a Shaman, Druid or Cleric.  Your argument was very valid in that you said every group needs a CLERIC.  One class.  Very specific, and much harder to find.<P>Yes, I do realize that your slow spells are fairly mana costly.  Many other classes could say the same things about their respective lines of spells.  However, no other class has the mana-regenerating power that yours does at higher level.  Clarity2 and Theft of Thought easily keep your mana problems in check.  This doesn't mean that you're always full mana or that you can just fight constantly.  Yes, I realize you have to med, but you know the group will wait 60 seconds for you to get the added mana necessary to take on the next encounter.<P>This argument about how the only thing enchanters excell at is crowd control is bogus, my friend.  You have the second-best mana regen in the game (really the best if you think about it because bards have to go to a great deal of effort to keep mana song going at all times, and it cuts down on their effectiveness in other ares).  Your slows are far more than adequate.  At level 60 they are nearly identical to shaman slows (I'll try to get some numbers to back that claim up, if I can).  Your haste spells are un-matched.  Now add crowd-control to the mix and you have a class that no group in their right minds would pass up.  A group at high level is *usually* made up of a cleric, a chanter, and four 'other guys'.  As long as one of the 'other guys' is a tank, the group is fine.  Take out the enchanter (or the cleric, but that's not the issue at hand) and the 'other guys' become much more specific and the group weakens to the point that it could be described as crippled by the absence of an enchanter.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well the main issue here is that you simply can't do anything without an enchanter.  Noone can really argue this one.  Weather your doing crowd control or practicing in the dark arts of wizard AE and AE stuns (a lot of fun IMO) Its just very hard to get by with out the enchanter.  <P>I do have an enchanter alt, and I do have friends that play high level enchanters.  It is a very hard life, but... once the enchanter reaches high post 50 levels, they become very powerful.<P>Now Im not advocating a nerf to enchanters, but I do think something needs to be done about this dependence on that class.  Very recently bards mez and charm was made more effective.  This is a step in the right direction.<P>Surely some of you pure enchanters must concede to this problem.  Perhaps you havnt sat at the entrance of seb.. in a full 5 man group, with a couple other 5 man groups..waiting, hoping to see an enchanter zone in... only to find that the enchanter already has a spot in a group thats already down.  If you havt experianced it..then let me tell you..its very fustrating.  Heh, I wish there were more of you out there..but I understand why there are so few.. because the journey is do hard.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"Enchanters are over-powered at 50+. Can anyone disagree with this? If so, stop reading, because I really don't even want to hear what you have to say"<P>Well I can see this is going to be an up-hill struggle, but lets begin shall we.<P>I'd be interested in what class(es) you play by the way ? And I assume that you've been in groups that have folded because the enchanter left for another group ? Or just can't form a group because no enchanter is available ? Well this may be news to you but we've all been in groups where one or two group members have left and the group's folded. Blaming it on the abilities of one class just because you've had a few bad experiences isn't the basis for a solid argument.<P>However lets lets look at your argument. You're saying that an enchanter is too powerful because of it's wide range of spells.<P>Well I'd say that Verant agrees with you. Because Kunark and especially Velious have introduced a number of things that reduce or negate the spells of enchanters ie. Non-mezzable mobs and High magic resistance. Even the one new spell post 50 is a high mana low duration mezz spell. This basically means the enchanter is there to reduce downtime with buffs.<P>But with old world mobs and certain areas in the expansions the Enchanter class is still supreme. An enchanter can handle situations that no other class can help with, and reduce a groups downtime by a significant amount. I've seen this playing my enchanter to 51st, and with my 51st wizard. When grouped with no enchanter my only option as a wizard is to evac, when I know an enchanter could have easily handled those extra mobs easily.<P>And do you know what the problem is ? It's not enchanters, it's the game itself. The game is based around people grouping, so they made mobs hit harder and last longer than any player so that groups are needed to take them down. And as the players level they made the mobs increase in power exponentially. And the expansions increased this player/mob gap even further.<P>This has made zones with multiple high level mobs death traps for players. As you say the only way to deal with multiple mobs is to remove them from the fight. But as the mob levels increase no caster can destroy a mob without aggro getting them killed, and even the best equipped tank still takes a while to kill a mob. So the mezz line of spells, coupled with increase melee damage from hastes, mana regeneration and mob debuffs makes the enchanter a package that is impossible to resist. Which is why I started one, I got fed up of failing to group with my wizard in her 40s.<P>And the fact is that none of this will change. There will be no major increase in the damage output of any of the classes. Or their ability to take damage. There will be not major re-distribution of spells between classes. This is how the game will be. Clerics, Enchanters and Tanks will form the basis for all high level encounters and the rest will be relegated to support roles or just not invited unless a particular service is required.<P>So if you ever want to argue that over 50 encounters require specific classes due to the way Verant enchanced the mobs I might well support you.<P>If you're argument is that Enchanters are ruining EQ because you're had a few bad experiences in the past while grouping with/without them then I'm afraid you're on your own.<P>Bodasal Innuendas , 51st High Elven Channeler - Erollisi Marr<BR>Boddarc , 51st Darl Elf Enchantress - EM</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I almost didn't read your post, but your arrogance captured my attention.<P>------------------------------------------------<BR>I am a full-fledged math nerd so get ready for a post that reads like a physics problem. <BR>------------------------------------------------<P>Coulda fooled me; your post has none of the logical structure that a mathematician would be capable of, and while I got ready for a post that reads like a physics problem, all I saw was one big whine.<P>------------------------------------------------<BR>Enchanters are over-powered at 50+. Can anyone disagree with this? If so, stop reading, because I really don't even want to hear what you have to say.<BR>------------------------------------------------<P>For those keeping score, the first clue that this was a whine post, and not a well written post of someone interested in rational discussan and persuasion.<P>------------------------------------------------<BR>The key ---&gt;&gt; TANKS CAN'T TANK ANYMORE<BR>------------------------------------------------<P>Would be nice to see some support of this assertion. Most of the anecdotal evidence points to warriors still being able to tank, if not the other melee classes.<P>------------------------------------------------<BR>Without slows in some good groups it would take 1/3 of the cleric's mana to kill a single blue mob.<BR>------------------------------------------------<P>Really... then why do I hear stories about good groups where the cleric never has to cast CH more than one per mob?<P>------------------------------------------------<BR>... Enchanter power is directly (and probably linearly) related ...<BR>------------------------------------------------<P>I assume WRT damage prevented? Even this is not true, since the enchanter also takes significant damage on mez breaks.<P>------------------------------------------------<BR>There is also a linear relation between the normal speed at which casters med and the necessity of enchanters due to their clarity spells, but we won't discuss that further.<BR>------------------------------------------------<P>For there to be a linear relation, you have to have quantitative values. Even so, this is completely absurd, not something I'd expect from a... math nerd. Are you telling me that the faster a caster meditates, the more need there is for clarity?!?!<P>------------------------------------------------<BR>What was the roll of mages and wizards back in mistmoore at level 20? <BR>------------------------------------------------<P>This is a completely different issue unrelated to the enchanter; this is an issue of the disparity between long term caster damage vs long term melee damage, and HP totals of mobs ballooning to a level that a nuker can't store up enough mana to ever be useful nuking.<P>------------------------------------------------<BR>Now for my opinions -- I hate enchanters. I loathe them. I just can't STAND that if you don't have a cleric and an enchanter in the group, you simply don't have a group. Yes, there are measly, pathetic alternatives that give you a total second-rate, worthless group. Who wants that, though?<BR>------------------------------------------------<P>envy - noun - spiteful malice and resentment over another's advantage <P>I was wrong earlier, this isn't a whine post, it's a class envy post.<P>------------------------------------------------<BR>Look no further than fixing the enchanters. They are RUINING EverQuest, and most people don't notice. <BR>------------------------------------------------<P>Actually, there's a much stronger case for complete heal singlehandedly ruining everquest, due to the need for mobs to be strong enough to give warrior / cleric a challenge.<P>Now, for a little math.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Note: For this discussion, power = ability to deal damage over the course of a fight.<P>Mob power increases QUADRATICALLY with respect to the number of mobs engaged in combat.<P>2 mobs are 3-4 times as powerfun as a single mob<BR>3 mobs are 6-9 tims more powerful<BR>4 mobs are 10-16 times more powerful<BR>5 mobs are 15-25 times more powerful<BR>etc<P>However, most classes power level remains constant when the number of mobs increase since all of their skills are directed at single targets. Even classes with area effect damage only increase their power lineraly wrt the number of mobs.<P>What does this mean? This means that if you buffed people up enough to be able to readily survive a 3-4 pull without crowd control, then fights against single mobs would not just be easy, they'd be pathetically easy.<P>Verant doesn't want the game to be pathetically easy.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>For EQ to be well designed, there has to be a way either eliminate the fact that mob power grows quadratically or to give players power that grows quadratically with the number of opponents.<P>Either way, the classes that have one or the other ability would be required to do any dungeon crawling and we'd have the same problem.<P>In any case, crowd control makes more sense than giving players quadratically increasing power; it makes the game strategic rather than mindless mass damage dishing.<P>Arlina</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

In a regular group setting I have 1200-1500 hp at lvl _42_ with my enchantress, depending on the level of the cleric.

You have slows, hastes, good healing, rooting, stunning, and decent damage. Replace rogue with monk to lessen the need for crowd control. Replace paladin with ranger for damage and snares.

</FONT><HR>Put that last post up when I was tierd, forgot a couple issues. <BR>First, a note in my first post I said <BR>--- A CLERIC and a tank, I don't mean a meele player they have a full blown warrior, no ranger, no monk etc.-----<BR>I specifically mentioned warrior and I ment warrior not pally or SK or anything else. But now on to my other points I forgot in the first post.<BR>I think you need to think of Enchanters as Bards in the casting world. We are less then stellar solo but when grouped we are extremely effective. The only way we can really kill mobs is to do what you say you hate that we get. Our DD's are a joke at these levels so nuking is out, our dot's are the same. I have yet to see any debuff (Incapacitate, Weaken, etc) turn the tide of a battle like it can in PvP. So what does that leave for Enchanters, speed and CC. <BR>Now lets consider what is a MUST. I mean a absolute must have that we can do. Get a shaman to speed. The diff between Enc and Shaman speed is less then the diff between Enc and Shaman Slow. So speed can be taken off. <BR>Next is clarity. Yes it is a awesome spell, but not a absolute must. Bards can replace us, or not maybe the casters just need to slow down on the nuking and you have to set a min more for the cleric to med, but clarity does not make or break a group. <BR>I have already given my thoughts on the Slow so I won't talk about that. <BR>And Lastly is the CC. Yes you are right I love CC. I love sitting at the ent to KC and hearing TRAIN and stopping it as my group eats them one at a time.<BR>Ok, so what is the solution?? Who do you give our abilities too, because whoever you do will be the new uberclass that you have tagged us with. <BR>I see the problem that you are having as we are needed for CC like clerics are needed for heals and we bring a few more things with us for the ride, but we are there to be traffic cops make no mistake. I have never had a tank demand a speed when I am LOM and keeping 3 mobs mezzed. He waits, which to me means that speeding is not my first issue of business and everyone seems to know that. <BR>I see your arguement along the lines of saying that Druids are uber class because not only can the Snare and Damage (DD or Dot) but they get to heal as well, even though that is not what they are there to do in most groups. <BR>So think of us as bards in a way that we are made for grouping and we never actually get to kill anything. We are simply a catalyst for the other members.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Enchanters are useful for:<BR>Clarity<BR>Haste<BR>Mez<P>For clarity: Most casting classes have SOME form of mana regen spell. Wizards have harvest (and at 50+ Mana Skin) Necros have whatever their HP -&gt; Mana spell is, Shaman's have Canibalize, Mages can summon mod rods at 44, and give them to others. Also, bard mana song gives mana too!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Mez: Necro's get a form of mez, as do bards, and there are other forms of crowd control.. root, FD pull, charm. I was just reading a post that a LOT of stuff in Velious either has very high MR (All enchanter spells are magic based, high MR = no mez, no nuke, no debuff) or are unmezable. When stuff has high MR, i feel useless, because the only spells i can cast are Tashania (lowers MR, often dosnt help) and dispell, along with buffs. <P>slow: Shamans are better at slow, I RARELY slow (47-48 enchanter). <P>haste: There are haste items, and shamans get haste spells too (although the spells enchanters had 15-20 levels ago..), also bard songs.<P>Many groups look for Enchanter OR Bard. Bards can cover haste, mana regen, and crowd control, and they tank better  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alright, I think the conversation has gotten quite a bit off-base here.  I don't think that we're talking about my original post.  My original point was basically that enchanters are over powered (more accuratly overly-necessary) because of the weakness of the tanks.  The situation this causes is that which Phantomsix described.<P><BR>Boddarc...<P>Nice post.  I think that you're falling into the trap of seeing this post as a claim that enchanters need to be nerfed.  Read it again if you wish, because I never said that.  The point I'm making is that enchanters are over-powered by the weaknesses of other classes (tanks specifically).  Clerics are as well, but they, again, are not the topic of conversation here.  Like you said, the problem is not enchanters, it's the game itself.  The problem, however, co a head concerning enchanters because they are our only saviors from our (our = all classes put together) weaknesses as a whole.<P><BR>Arlina...<P>'Really... then why do I hear stories about good groups where the cleric never has to cast CH more than one per mob?'<P>What groups are these?  Extremely high level?  Really well-rounded?  Lots of pure classes like rogues, warriors, clerics, etc?  or is there an ENCHANTER in the group covering slows, haste, CC, etc?<P>'Even this is not true, since the enchanter also takes significant damage on mez breaks.'<P>This is a very poor statement.  First of all, a good enchanter could take 0 damage from mez breaks while the tanks are entirely incapable of saying the same thing about tanking the extra mobs the entire fight.  Also, this 'mez break damage' will never ever compare to that of the tanks tanking the mobs the entire fight.  This is all assuming you have a good enchanter, of course.  (good = not entirely stupid, not necessarily a god-like player)<P>'Would be nice to see some support of this assertion (Tanks can't tank anymore). Most of the anecdotal evidence points to warriors still being able to tank, if not the other melee classes.'<P>Well, I didn't think I had to support this one with any evidence.  I didn't really expect anyone to even attempt denying that tanks can't tank Kunark mobs worth a squat in comparison to old-world mobs.<P>'For there to be a linear relation, you have to have quantitative values. Even so, this is completely absurd, not something I'd expect from a... math nerd. Are you telling me that the faster a caster meditates, the more need there is for clarity?!?!'<P>There is no quantitative values necessary here.  It's plain to see that if a caster meds x% of their mana per minute then there is a desire (we'll assume a quantitative way of espressing it) y.  As x approaches zero (you could us a calculus limit here if necessary), then y approaches infinite.  If you can't med at all, then you 100% HAVE to have clarity (or mana regen in general).  As x approaches 100% (caster always has fm) then y is 0.  There is no reason at all to have clarity.  See?  Linear, but inverse.  If you were to express it as an equation, y = 1/x.<P>'This is a completely different issue (casters have no place like they did at low level) unrelated to the enchanter; this is an issue of the disparity between long term caster damage vs long term melee damage, and HP totals of mobs ballooning to a level that a nuker can't store up enough mana to ever be useful nuking.'<P>That is part of it.  True, casters can't nuke a mob down in seconds like they used to, and true this is not due to enchanters.  However, the problem I'm really stating here is the weakness of tanks.  Tanks weakness leads to enchanter power leads to caster weakness IN PART.  The fact that they can't nuke things down fast enough is a caster balance issue, but even if they could, that job would be made a very lowly and less necessary one by the power of the enchanter for reasons that I stated (i.e. easier to just off the mob than to burn it down).<P>Nolwen...<P>The rarity of a spell does not concern me.  It's potential you should pay attention to.  If I wanted to discuss that, I'd discuss how hard it is to get the uber pets for mages and the uber nukes for wizards at 60.  It's a point that could be made in a different conversation, but it's not entirely valid here.<P><BR>Megdiinn...<P>Yes, it's true that you can't solo much.  Yes, it's true that you are a 'catalyst' for other classes (well, put by the way).  The point is that you are a necessary 'catalyst' for the other classes and that necessity is spawned due to the weakness of tanks vs. mobs of similar level.<P><BR>A lot of the posts here are just carrying out my argument for me.  Mezzes are replaced by bards or necros, clarity by bards, slows by shamans, etc, etc, etc.  And by the time you had all these replacement classes together (and enough of the to get the job done (i.e. 2 bards)) you'd have 4 players by my count.  That's ridiculous.<P>Another thing I don't want to hear about is wizard harvest and manaskin spells.  First of all, manaskin gives 1 mana per tick.  It lasts for 90 minutes, which is 900 ticks.  So that's a total of 900 mana (2 bubbles about) in a full hour.  But it costs 300 to cast and it gets beaten off of you pretty quickly soon.  So you'd have to keep it up for 30 minutes to pay for itself, plus another 60 to get the whoppin' bubble and a half out of it.  Harvest gives 210-220 mana per cast (10 minutes).  Every 10 minutes is 100 ticks.  So that's about 2.1-2.2 mana per tick total.  Woopy.  Clarity is 12-15 mana based on what I hear.  I'll have to do the tests and figure it out sometime.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

When CHing a tank you spend 400 mana to heal about 2k-4k HP depending on the HP total of the tank (some get upwards of 5k hp), and how close to death you cast the spell. I've heard many stories on the enchanter boards of enchanters tanking a mob from the time it's woken up to the time it's killed, solely from the aggro of a few mezzes and maybe a slow. That's a significant amount, methinks.<P>------------------------------------------------<BR>There is no quantitative values necessary here. (about some assertion of a linear relation)<BR>------------------------------------------------<P>Do you even know what linear means? F is a linear relation if and only iff F(a+b)=F(a)+F(b), and if scalars are meaningful, then also F(c*d) = c*F(d) where c is a scalar.<P>If something is NOT a quantitative value, it cannot be part of a linear relation.<P>Anyways, it seems from your response that you're actually thinking about the relative increase in mana regeneration clarity gives you. The 'need' for clarity is a highly subjective matter that is not necessarily identical with the relative increase in mana regeneration.<P>------------------------------------------------Linear, but inverse.<BR>------------------------------------------------<P>The correct term is 'inversely proportional'.<P>------------------------------------------------<BR>However, the problem I'm really stating here is the weakness of tanks. Tanks weakness leads to enchanter power leads to caster weakness IN PART. <BR>------------------------------------------------<P>No matter what the offensive power of the tanks is, the enchanter will always be saving the exact same relative amount of clerical mana; 3 mobs fighting at the same time will over the course of a fight deal 6 times as much damage as a single mob will, irrespective of how strong the tanks are, so the enchanter, with ideal CC conditions, will always be preventing 50% of the damage taken no matter how strong the tanks are. The only way to buff the tanks enough for CC to not be necessary is to make tanks absorb damage SO well that the clerical mana needed to heal them is insignificant, but if things get to that point, then there won't even be a need for HEALERS since the regeneration breastplates would likely be enough to keep the tanks alive.<P>Arlina</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, first off I do NOT play a chanter, but I thought I'd throw my 2cp in here.  In case the Twipple hasn't noticed, enchanters and clerics are the premier examples of 'support' classes.  They were MADE for a group atmosphere.  How many high level chanters and clerics do you see soloing?  They can't, or at best, it's a very risky proposition.  Grouping the the price one pays for choosing to be an enchanter or cleric.  Neither do even 'average' damage thru DD or DoT's, and what damage a chanter does thru DD is made worse than normal casters with a 'megataunt' addition.  Both clerics and chanters do their damage in an abstract way, could be why the original poster can't see it, other group members dish out damage for the cleric/chanter with the time made available by heals/stuns/mezzes/buffs.  So even thru your own argument, all clerics and enchanters are guilty of is increasing the efficiency of tanks primarily (which destroys your tanks can't tank argument), casters second, and that fits perfectly into their 'support' role.  Other classes are capable of filling the chanter/cleric role as well, but at a reduced capability.  Shaman, druids, and necros are the obvious choices for that.  I think they are capable of providing more than a "measly, pathetic alternative that gives you a total second-rate, worthless group", as you so eloquently put it.  This is a strange subject, I've never heard a class whine post about a 'support' class being TOO powerful, especially when they derive that power from the group, not from themselves.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Saying tanks can't tank as well now as compared to pre-Kunark disturbs me.  RoK and SoV are expansions, for more of a challenge, or for 'experienced' players.  I for one welcome the new challenges, it's fun having to make new strategies and adapt, rather than stick with the same old tactics.  This whole post STILL seems like a complaint that "tanks must rely on another class, and we don't like it".  All classes rely on one another, melee more than others for more visible needs.  There is no one self sufficient class out there, not one, not for all situations.  The case as it is right now is that they've allowed TOO MANY spells and skills to be duplicated across class lines.  If this keeps up, why not just make a default new character class, one that does everything, solo's everything, can use any ability/spell and whatnot, and start over?  That's the only thing that will stop these class envy posts from happening.  And please note as I said before, I don't even PLAY a chanter and I see this quite clearly.  If you as a tank can't handle change, stick with SolB, Lguk, and other older dungeons, otherwise adjust your tactics and stop this class envy crap.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This will be short as I'm currently typing with one hand and just slammed the other in the door...<P>Only point to make here -- Guyz, stop telling me to start an enchanter.  I'm not whining (although I admit that I was initially).  I'm making a valid point that applies to everyone that doesn't play enchanters and clerics.  If we aren't one of you, we are filler.  And this is all due to the fact that tanks can't tank.  Yes, enchanters have more trouble mezzing, but they go to more effort and they can still do it.  Tanks can't really do anything to take less dmg than beter their equip (which doesn't help a real great deal).  You guyz become the best (and in many cases the ONLY) way of dealing with situations.  Stop trying to compare sob stories.  The point is that your current over-poweredness comes from the weakness of other classes.<P>Oh, and the 'inversely proportional' was correct, I admit.  I knew there was something about the phrase I was using that didn't sound right but didn't care enough to sit down and think what it was.

</FONT><HR>If tanks were buffed so they'd be able to tank, enchanters would be just as "overpowered" as they are now; if enchanters can make tanks 5 times more powerful vs mobs now (70% attack speed increase with 70% attack speed decrease = 5 times more powerful, if the numbers on eq.castersrealm.com are right), if tanks get their power increased, enchanters still make tanks 5 times more powerful. Enchanters still cut the damage taken by a 4 mob pull by up to 60% no matter how strong the tanks are.<P>I repeat, adjusting the power of tanks relative to mobs has very little effect if any on how powerful enchanters are.<P>Arlina</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>umm guys, you don't prevent % of damage, you prevent a flat amount of damage, each unit of time, so if you get a 4 mob pull, and they hit for 100 damage each every 10 seconds, I know this isn't accurate, but it's an example, and you mez three, then the amount of damage prevented will depend on the amount of damage done by the tanks, if they kill a mob in 100 seconds you will prevent 6000 damage, while if they kill a mob in 50 seconds you prevent 3000 damage, same deal applies if they tank such that they take half as much damage, yes you prevent a similar percentage of damage, but it's not about the percentage, it's about the absolute damage prevented, and the corresponding amount of mana saved.  Also if you add in slows, of say 50% reduction in damage dealt by the mob, you end up saving 9000 damage, or in other words, 4 complete heals on a level 55 tank, assuming a reasonably comfortable safety margin of a bubble an a half.  In addition to this, the enchanter hastes the group, a 50% increase in speed would prevent an additional 1500 damage in the origional scenario, meaning that on a 4 mob pull with an enchanter, the tanks end up taking 1000 damage after control is established, 250 damage per slowed mob that is cut down down by hasted tanks.<BR> rather than taking a whopping 10,000 damage, 4000 while the first mob dies, 3000 while the second mob dies, 2000 while the third dies and 1000 while the fourth dies. This would kill the group, and the agroed mobs would probably wipe out the cleric after the first ch, assuming that it could be completed before the tank died.<BR> In addition to this, the cleric gets an added half of her mana to cast, versus a group without a manamaker, allowing pulls to be speeded up, so ya see what twipple means by the power of enchanters, while it's true they don't do damage themselves, they do actually prevent more damage than the cleric could heal, I admit that this is a best case scenario, but this is the sort of difference that you make in the real game, a group that needs a chanter really is 1/15th as effective as one with a chanter, if it's made up entirely of tanks, with one cleric.  Think about this, and when you think of a class that has this kind of an impact, let me know, and also think this, the power of a group is not just how many mobs it can kill in an hour, it's also how many mobs it can survive in that same hour, and how careful the pullers have to be, and how many minutes are lost to cr, rezes, zoneings, and the like. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First off, you DON'T prevent a flat rate; when you have 3 mobs mezzed you're preventing three times as much dps (damage per second) as when you only have one mob mezzed.<P>Secondly, there's nothing wrong with looking at things in a percentile way if you are consistent. A lvl 60 enchanter can increase the group's damage output by 70% by hasting the tanks. If you have 2 tanks, adding a third tank with the same dps increases the groups damage output by 50%. From the percentile perspective this calculation is FAR easier, and just as valid.<P>As for those other things (cr time, etc), those are ignored because it's hard to quantify things like that, and pretty much all of those things lean in favor of the enchanter and cleric... so if you are able to show based on quantifiable things that an enchanter or cleric is powerful, then those intangible things just strengthen the argument.<P>The thing I'm arguing is that Twipple's analysis of the situation is wrong. We KNOW enchanters are powerful, and almost necessary, and he wants to fix that by making tanks stronger. However, that approach doesn't fix the fundamental problem (the need to reduce the quadratically increasing power of multiple mobs to a linear amount), which leaves the enchanter equally as powerful.<P>Arlina</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I really liked mr twiTTle's remark about how meaningless the damage taken by an enchanter is when a mez breaks.<P>Im only lvl 34, but even at this level it can be so easy to get smacked down when a mez breaks.  <P>say your stun gets resisted, say no one is watching to pull the mob off you . .. theres a very good chance that your either dead or near dead by the time you can have that mob re-mezzed.  oh, then guess what! the other mezzed mob has woken up while going through this Bam! dead for sure!<P>Ive been training tanks and casters how to take advantage of my CC abilities for way too many levels to put up with twit's comment. Every enchanter has died dozen's of times because the tank or nuker  wouldnt let him do his job. (wouldnt stay on one mob) or wasnt watching if i couldnt re-establish mez in time.<P>instead of all the peni. ..errr class envy, why not sit back and let the xp roll in as I give you (with the cleric's help) the capability of fighting nearly non-stop for hours on end!<P><BR>now, verant obviously thinks we are too powerful because over the last year or so many things have been takin away from us or given to other classes to dilute our ability . . . for example the clarity-like or mez-like spells that many other classes have.  <P>my favourite example is when mages whined that their pets werent dual weilding <P>. .. their pets had already been upgraded to take this into account but their whining won.  <P>they got to see the animation of their pets dual weilding and to make up for the imbalance created since their pets already did the damage they should of if they had been dual weilding, the pet weapon delay bonus was taken out.  I lost 37% of the damage my pet can do.  <P>I was told too bad your not a pet class. necros got spells to make up for the nerf (the enchanter mez like spells - another insult).  my pet was too wimpy as it was,  i often tanked for it! Now, that whole way of playing is gone.   . . and dont tell me to charm,  without a zone border nearby or a very understanding group charm is virtual suicide even with a green target and cha near 200.<P>Twit,  why is it that you would rather be held back,  get xp slower because im not their to make the mobs get in line to die? </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First of all, where is the physics problem in your post?  I guess that since you've gotten a C+ in linear algebra, you consider yourself a brainiac.  How about showing it?  Pretty obvious by your statement at the outset that you've got some kind of complex there bud.  Your post is probably the stupidest thing I've read in a long time.<P>You say enchanters are overpowered because of mana regen, slow, haste, and crowd control.  Let's look at each of those one at a time.<P>1. Mana regen.  Necros in skellie form regen mana faster than clarity.  A Bard's mana song increases mana regen of the party at least, if not more, than clarity.  A healer and a wincing class can increase mana much faster than clarity.<P>2. Slow.  Excuse me?  Since when is this even useful?  If you're fighting a mob low enough that slow even sticks, by the time you've cast it, your tanks had better have the mob 75% dead already.  If the mob is putting your tanks in a blender, then chances are the debuff isn't going to stick anyway.  You're wasting mana to cast it over and over until it sticks.<P>3. Haste.  OK - please tell me exactly how haste does any good without a tank to cast it on?  Oh, you say there are always plenty of tanks?  I wonder why that would be when they are so underpowered.....?  If Enchanters are gods, why are there so few of them?  Could it be that they die 20 times more often than a warrior and nobody can bear to play them past 16th level?<P>4. Crowd control.  This is useful only in specific situations.  If you have one good puller and a few good tanks, you have absolutely no need for crowd control.  I've actually had very little use for MEZ since venturing into Velious.  No doubt there are situations where Mez is essential, but Enchanters are not the only class granted this ability.  Keep in mind that crowd control is most often necessary because of a bad puller.  <P>Use your brain instead of your mouth.  You might notice a difference.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Thanks for a little support, there, Darwinson.  Someone is finally catching on to my meaning.<P>Arlina, let me try getting a little mroe broad for you.  I submit that at level 1 the tank classes and nukers are superior to enchanters by a relatively significant margin.  I don't want to agrue this, just assume it's true if you disagree.<P>Now, as time goes on the mobs get harder.  Tanks can't kill them as quickly, and they can't tank them for as long.  They're getting weaker in relation to the mobs.  Casters are using more and more of their mana to kill mobs.  Eventually as they level up they don't even have enough mana to kill half the blues that are out there on FM.  They also take much, much longer to pump all that mana out and they're killing mobs slower (killing fast is their job, and thus their power).  They too are getting weaker.<P>Enchanters, however, experience a different change.  As long as they can still stick mez on mobs they can still do their job.  Your job is to mez mobs and to prevent the damage taken by the group in a fight.  As the mobs get stronger, you are still ABLE (key word ABLE.  I don't care how hard it is, if you can do it, you can do it) to mez the mobs.  The amount of damage you're preventing becomes larger and larger.  You are getting stronger, and it gets to the point that your damage-preventing skills are unparalleled and you become a necessity.<P>You guys that keep mentioning your faults and weaknesses are not at all listening to the argument at hand here.  I'm not saying that your mez sticks all the time.  I'm not saying that you don't die first and that that doesn't suck.  I'm not saying that I don't care how much damage you take or that it doesn't kill you, I'm saying it's insignificant next to the damage that you prevent in the meantime.<P>I don't think enchanters really need a nerf.  I *CERTAINLY* don't want Verant to start handing your mezzing skills out to other classes.  I want the other classes (tanks and casters) to start getting their skills back.  I want them to start having the power that they used to because with every level they lose more of it.  With every level you gain more power.  You may not gain power at mezzing (i.e. it gets harder), but the ability to mez becomes more powerful itself (i.e. it accomplishes far more).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Twipple<P>you are the one not listening to the others, there are many posts who dont say its NOT like Enchanters are very good, what they tried to say is: its ULTRA-hard to play one effectively, not every Ench is good, I met many who screwed over and over again, killing the group several times cause they didnt know their timing, didnt trust their groupies.<P>Lets review some basics, Halfling Warriors need the least amount of XP to level therefore you can say they are an easy class. Trolls need much more XP to level, they are therefore harder plus they have a faction problem plus the size is a fact too, so for a few advantages, higher STR, STA, Regen, Infravision they get a high penalty and are therefore harder to play. When I think about it I think, yes, regarding how much harder they are to play the SHOULD be the better warriors, why else would someone playing them (no offense to the hardcore RPGs out there, you  guys are doing a great job).<P>Same goes for the Enchanter, they die more often, they are weak alone, if jumped by a greenie they rarely make it to the zone if they cant mezz or stun it. The resists in Velious are very high, making it difficult for an Ench to cast his spells.<P>When someone depends so heavily on a group like the Enchanter, shouldnt he (or she) be VERY valuable to them: I think its still very balanced if you regard those examples and remember Ench are no MUST, if you find a Bard who knows his job that one can haste and mezz too, Necroes too I think (actually I never saw one doing it).<P>The Ench class paid a heavy prize to reach post 50 levels cause most of their numbers gave up on the way to that goal, only the best and most motivated can make it, you can play a bad warrior when theres a cleric around to safe yer job and it really isnt THAT hard to stick that sword into the enemies flesh but its HARD (really hard) to get the timing and the experience to be a good Ench, cant be a bad one if you are actually over 50, one bad move and your toast (your group prolly too).<P>I dont agree with you that Ench are godlike but I agree that their role is a keyrole in specific situations and that they deserve their role.<P>Darrke</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

For instance, I've already seen groups of lvl 35-45 people camp lguk from the exe up to the bedroom... if you made tanks 10 times more powerful a single group of this level could camp the entire bloody dungeon by themselves.<P>Your approach to fixing things is simply not acceptable; you can't fix EQ by making things trivially easy!

Classes that are non-stackable SHOULD be more powerful than stackable ones; few groups would want 2 enchanters, but 2 clerics can do a lot, or having 3 rogues in a group...<P>Arlina</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Darrke-Quellious....<P>Your argument that difficult classes should be more powerful than the easier ones is not at all valid.  In your troll and halfing warrior example, it's not true at all.  Look at the differences between a 60 troll and 60 halfling warrior.  The overall hitpoint difference is probably somewhere around 5%.  It is possible it could reach a little closer to 10%, but I highly doubt it.  The troll will most likely have an additional 30 STR.  However, the troll doesn't have the added 30 AGI that the halfling does.  Or the 15 extra DEX.  These are all aproximations, of course.  Although I hold this in very low esteem, the halfling also has better factions.  Trolls can slam without a shield, but halflings have stunning kicks to make up for this weakness.  You see?<P>To further make my point, imagine playing a troll shadowknight.  They have (or had before this last patch) the worst experience penalty by far.  I read this on a ShowEQ board on which they listed the total experience needed for every class/race at every level.  How powerful do you think a 60 Troll SK is?  Perhaps more so than inkie SKs, but certainly not powerful in comparison to say a 60 human monk, which levels far quicker.<P>And again I say you are no listening.  I don't care one iota how hard it is to play your class.  What I care about is the fact that there are, as was stated earlier, 3+ groups sitting at the zone in Sebilis that have 5 people and are nearly unable to act until they get that enchanter (or cleric) to make fights winnable.  The point is *I do not CARE how hard it is*.  You can't convince me there's not a more difficult class to level.  I don't play a bard, but I would certainly guess they require the most effort to play.  Don't try to convince me otherwise because I've done my homework and I know all the arguments you'll use.<P>Arlina....<P>"A lvl 60 shaman that casts slow on all the mobs prevents more damage than I will with crowd control on a 4 mob pull! Adding a rogue as a third melee class prevents more damage than an enchanter can on a 2 mob pull."<P>Neither of these is true.  The difference between your slows at level 60 is not very big.  Forelorn Deeds is an UBER slow.  The shaman slows them down to doing about 20% of the damage they did before.  You slow them down to 0% by mezzing.  This is a totally ridiculous statement.<P>The rogue bit is certainly not true.  If the rogue is a 3rd melee class, then obviously you mean that there are 2 others in the group.  Giving haste to these two other classes would nearly equal the damage of adding a non-hasted rogue (if not exceed it).  However, that only SLIGHTLY superior damage would not be worth giving up the power to mez the other mob.  In addition to which, this only applies to 2 mob pulls.  This would also only be even remotely feasible if you had another slower (i.e. shaman).<P><BR>"Adding a second cleric to the group can heal more than the damage I would have prevented on a 3 mob pull."<P>Refer back to Darwinson's example and read the numbers.  This would only be true if you prevented less than half the damage dealt by a pull of 3 mobs.  In actuality, you prevent far more than half.<P><BR>"If you make tanks 10 times more powerful so they can deal with a 3 mob pull without haste, slows, and CC in the same manner they would now with an enchanter, then the game would become too easy, and if you did get an enchanter in the group, the game would become RIDICULOUSLY easy."<P>I'm not looking for the tanks getting 10 times more powerful.  I want them to regain the power they already had.  Consider back at level 45ish in Solusek B.  Groups of tanks could take 3-mob pulls, but not without a challenge.  It was fun, you could accomplish a lot with any reasonable configuration of a group, and it was still a challenge.  Add an enchanter to the mix, and yes things got easier.  Remove the enchanter, and the group was still viable.  In Sebilis, this no longer holds true in most cases.  The enchanter leaves, so you go to the zone and look for a new one.<P>Think about this:  If you were to set up a raid on the Plane of Hate, what would you need?  Well, for starters you are going to need a puller.  Most likely this will require a FD puller.  That's one of two classes (monk, SK) or 3 if you count the necro (which I don't).  You'll need tanks, so that's one of say 3-4 classes depending on whether or not you count monks or rangers.  You don't really NEED nukers, but they are a big bonus.  That's 3 classes there (mages, wizards, druids).  Now you just need the two most important elements - clerics and enchanters.  The whole point of this entire post is that you NEED them and there is no substitute.   You can't have the raid without both.  Please don't bring up the cleric thing.  I know.  I agree.  They're just as bad.  But this discussion is about enchanters.  The fact is that there isn't much you can do without them at high level.  That's my point.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000604-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000604-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000604-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000604-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000604&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000604&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
