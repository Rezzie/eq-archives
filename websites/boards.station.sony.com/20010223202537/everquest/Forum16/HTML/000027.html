</FONT><HR>I don't agree with the Gm's on the ac ring situation. I have gone LD while buying from merchants and lost a couple hundred plat and some dyed fine plate. I even went thru and bought all of the merchants items to see if it was on the merchant. It wasn't, and I petitioned the Gm's and they might as well to me to kifdh myself. They are so real rivjd at times. Well every time. I even had a bug where the boat kept on giving me non melee and falling damage and I was just sitting there. The GM says well I can't help I'll report the bug, but I am not allowed to rez people do to bug problems sorry and ports of the boat. I lost the corpse too. The GM said it may had fallen off the boat. Well there goes almost full shiverback and some Ry'gorr. The GM did mention someone else having the same problem only not dying.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Umm, I'd be quite upset. Did you happen to have log turned on? I'm sorry, but the ONLY time a GM is supposed to do a res, is when the death is due to a bug. Apprentice guides are uselss, Guides are only good for corpse retrievals from lava and situations like your's where a bug caused your corpse to be unrecoverable, and to res in those situations. Full blown GM's are the only ones who have the power to solve any major issues, but unfortunately on my server, they're almost never on, and when they are, they seem to be far to busy to bother with any real problems the players must have. If all you say is true, and especially if you have it logged and such appropriately, I would not let this die. I would continue to raise a stink, and go as high as possible (raise this stink within the rules of course) and see what happens. You are the customer, and you are always right. You should demand re-imbursment. If the GM did his job correctly, that incident should have been logged, both in a bug report by the assisting GM, and on his daily log of noteworthy events on his web page. If he did not, he should not be allowed to continuein the GM program.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Whitelightt I am not sure if Verant can do this. But I see "game saved" coming up everyonce in awhile so it would seem that they might store back-up disk each day on all accounts. If this is true you could ask them if they could go back to the day you had the ring in your possession after getting it form the Ancient Cyclops. Tell them you would like to have that save restored prior to you meeting Hasten. <P>I know this post was originally about 20 days ago so of course any exp and items you got after that date would not be able to be transferred back. But if you don't mind sacrificing the exp gain on your current character, I would see if they keep back-up copies and if they can restore your character prior to meeting Hasten.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I really think you are wasting your time. I play on Cazik thule, and most of the time there is never a GM online. I have lost many items due to trading bugs, bugs in the attacking system, not to count how many times I have died to unexplained circumstances. Almost all of these times the GMs have been able to do nothing. In the case of when I traded an Item in qyenos which "fell through the floor" the GM who was online told me to talk to a particular GM on a certain day at a certain time, which I did, and of course I did not get any reply. He may have been busy but this is just another example of lost items.. etc to bugs where GMs can do nothing. I propose rather than to have wandering GMs there be a similar command to /report  to log a call with the GMs with real power (the power to check logs) that goes into an email box on the GMs side or somthing. That way they could check logs etc in thier time.. and you wouldnt have to worry about sitting online for hours waiting. Sure a rez request is somthing different, but Im sure for issues such as bugged death-corpse unretrivable or lost items to bugs etc.. this would be a great idea. Anyways.. i wonder if anyone from verant reads these posts?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am sorry that you lost your ring but unfortionatly you will not get your ring back. You would have to prove beyound a resonable doubt that your lost your ring due to a bug and even if it was a bug the gms wouldn't agnolog it openly because other people could just msg a gm saying that the bug caused me to looes thing ring and such and such. the only thing that is gonna come out of this is they mark it down and if this type of bug is reported more then the average number of fake bug reports then the testers will look into it. But it is no likely either because this quest is done succesfully ever day on different servers so make sure when you write your bug report that you make is a detailed as possible to help the programmers better spot a pattern if a bug does exist</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
