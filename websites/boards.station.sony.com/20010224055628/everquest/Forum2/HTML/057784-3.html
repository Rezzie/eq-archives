&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Please consider my argument.  In many ways, I agree that mage has good balance, both solo pre-50 (for xping; we can camp a variety of things solo post 50, of course) and outdoors.  In groups, however, we have been cheapened immeasurably over the last two expansions.  Classes independent of the mage may summon nearly every spell a mage can give to another, with the exception of modulation rods.  With the inclusion of the cleric Epic weapon, even this item has fallen into disfavor, as clerics do not need the rods to facilitate revivisence.<P>Do not get me wrong, the utilitarian aspect of mage is nice and I'm sure every class appreciates the ability to summon arrows, thrown daggers, food and water, bandages, etc.  Bags are not used, especially with the increasing connection problems causing the player to permanently lose everything it contains.  Where swords of runes were once a valued commodity to other pet classes as well as to the mage, they are neither necessary nor desired with the proc fix and the ability of pets to duel wield without weapons.  Before you write this off as a slam, it is not, and in fact, I appreciate the innovations Verant has created for each class.  The problem is that we are losing our utilitarian value.  We were not meant to be strictly a selfish class, and when our spells chiefly benefit our own ends and not those of the group, we have failed to offer unique and dependent group strength.  As it has been firmly established that pets in the majority of indoor as well as some outdoor zones have bad pathing (and if you do not ascribe to this view, invite me onto test with my class/level equivalent and I'll demonstrate how difficult it is for a competent player to handle pets falling outside of normal parameters).<P>In short, what I'm asking you to do is add value to us as a class that benefits the group.  Contributing to overall damage output is something every member of the group is capable of to a greater or lesser degree.  We do not receive credit for the damage our pets do, maybe to temper the overall taunt a mage's spells and pet's damage would do.  If our pet dies, the mob immediately goes after us, as some of the hate crosses over from pet to master (regardless of whether or not we cast on the mob), yet we receive no credit for the damage dealt by our pets.  Doesn't that strike you as odd?  The game mechanics may prevent this being changed, but now think again how this necessary evil weakens our ability to claim a kill or contribute to the overall damage of a single group.<P>Just to refute your earlier statement about advancing at all levels,  with the equipment available to each class, no classes can be argued as unsoloable.  Some more powerful than others, though the fact remains that we never are or will be close to the kind of soloer a class capable of kiting, fear-kiting or snare/root/darkness can manage.  Necromancers, shadow knights, bards, some clerics, enchanters, rogues, and monks may fear-kite, to greater or lesser degrees.  Druids can fear-kite animals.  These are with innate abilities.  Druids, bards, rangers, paladins, shadow knights, necromancers, enchanters, wizards, clerics, and shamans may root or snare/darkness or both, enabling kiting.  With the addition of certain warrior weapons, Warriors are now capable of casting darkness as well.  Mages cannot kite because they cannot slow their target (jboots and sow from a potion the exceptions, though these are available to all classes as well, not an exception per se), and they cannot root without engaging the mob.  And of course, all of our dd spells, including the dots (unlike the dots of other classes), have a good chance to break root.  Again, maybe I need to reiterate, I'm not attacking you or anyone here.  I wish to point out facts.  We are the only class which cannot independently root/snare, we receive no class-specific equipment to make up for this shortcoming, and given that on many raids as well as when traveling invisible, invisible to undead or invisible to animals, we lose our primary means of protection, a shortcoming that no other class has to deal with (we are the only pure caster who does not get invisibility to undead, curiously) we are weakened as a contributor to the group (or with invisibility, to self-preservation).  I'm not pointing out that you should give us all these things just because the classes mentioned have them.  Instead, I'm trying to refute your argument earlier that we have very little do adjust to maintain balance, and more importantly, that we may solo competently through all the levels.  <P>And let us not forget that the other classes are losing their utilitarian dependence on the mage class.  Items are replacing our function as conjurers.  Unfortunately our balance is becoming increasingly threatened by a surplus of new item effects.  <P>On the surface, I agree that there looks to be very little that needs to be altered, and I can understand your point of view as someone who does not play a mage.  All classes have their weaknesses, and I think that we should approach this class realistically to provide rational solutions while maintaining balance.<P>** Though I cannot say my answers are the best, I have contributed a few ideas on Part 2 of the mage talk.<P>Thanks for your time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>To Fix Mages we need the following:<P>1. Our Pets and Dmg spells need to be increased by the same percentage that Mobs were with each of the expansions.<BR>   for example: mobs generaly got a 75% increase and magic resists in Kunarks SO pets and DD go up in 75% of thier dmg/hps/etc.  It is SAD that a level 60 pet does 2 more pts of dmg per hit than a level 49 pet.  And our DD goes up 214 pts.  11 levels of HELL got get that much better.  Tell me a tank couldn't get many times that increase with a simple weapons drop.  or even a haste item. <P>2. Our Summons line need to be completly scrapped and re done.  You have give them to everyone else.  We need summoned weapons/armor that have stat boosters and effects that mean something.<P>3. We need an unresistable line of spells.  as well as spells from the different elements(cold, air, etc)  Allow us to addapt.<P>4. A defensive spell of some sort that is effective.<P>5. MANA REGEN- every class needs this increased by the same percentage that difficulty of encounters has been increased for the expansions.<P>6. There should be a pet for each encounter.  And pets that have little to no agro in a given dungeon.  Air pets that don't agro in Hate or something.  I don't know if you know it or not but PETS ARE BANNED on most RAIDs.  So what are we then? very poor, long casting, line of sight, highly resisted, WIZARDS.  <P>7. LARGER MANA POOLS WITH FASTER MANA REGEN(all casters)<P>8.  EPIC drops need to be fixed("off the minions..").</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>DAMAGE SHIELDS: <BR>Mages have powerful damage shields but they are often not worth casting in groups where damage is often spread out among a couple tanks.  DSing two tanks for one mob is not mana efficient.  All damage shields, even at lower levels, should be made group effect spells.  This would only ensure that they were as powerful in groups where mob dmg is often spread out as they are solo where pet takes all the dmg.<P>PET TAUNT:<BR>Pets need to taunt more frequently to keep mobs off us.  Mobs will often run past pet and hit for 25% of my hps before pet taunts again.  This happens sometimes even before I have cast anything on the mob.<P>DEATH RATE:<BR>Mages die a lot more when soloing than even some classes who are not even seen as soloers.  This is because our pet is out only defense.  We cant outrun, root, fear, mez, snare, FD, heal, become invulnerable, shadowstep, blind, etc.  Something needs to be done to give us at least one option when pet dies.  At least upgrade our pet healing.  Often times you can heal a pet and before you can recast heal the pet is dead and talking about blue mobs.<P>I think that idea about giving ring of flight some speed augmentation is a good way to start.  Not necessarily J-Boot speed but something.  I found out that when I have levitation going I cant jump and outrun mobs to get to zone like I can without it.<P>EXP:<BR>Given how much more frequently mages die than necros when soloing (and even in groups) and the fact that it is so much harder to outdamage our pet without using more mana than necessary, Id say something is askew.  Necros just snare/DoT lay on a couple more DoTs, fear, send pet in.  Virtually no risk against blue mobs and much easier to outdamage pet, or not even use pet, and get full exp.<BR>Mages have to wait for pet to inflict about 20% damage before it is even safe to start nuking without too much risk of mob agro on us. Even then nuking enough to outdamage pet is dangerous because once the mob runs for us we are going to take damage.  It is always uncertain when and if our pet will then be able to taunt it back off.  Furthermore using our damage shields causes a good deal of extra dmg that counts to neither the pet nor ourselves which means even less dmg left for us to claim as part of the 51% needed.  If we do manage to outdamage the pet it comes at the cost of significant downtime.  What?  Mages have no mana regen spells?  So not only are necro spells much more mana efficient (Im not saying they shouldnt be since they are DoTs) but they also have built in mana regen that is better than clarity.<P>I make this comparison not necessarily out of class envy but because necros are the closest class to magicians.  I am envious but thats besides the point.<P>DoTs:<BR>HAHAHAHAHAHAHA...  need I say more.<P>PETs:<BR>High level fire pet totally sucks.  For having such low hps one would think it might get decent nukes or even a working damage shield.  It would be interesting to have a pet that didnt melee but just provided spell casting support for your group when you dont need a tanking pet.<P>Air pets are not very usefull.  They are by far the least commonly seen mage pet in norrath.  Invisibility is occasionally useful but more often aggrevating.  The stun spell isnt cast frequently enough and often doesnt hit or last long enough.  They dont do enough damage to mobs and their low hps arent compensated for by their ability to take slightly less dmg than water pets that regen twice as fast.  The only possible use for them is against casting mobs and even then they do not stun frequently enough to disrupt casting very often.  Other pets bash and disrupt almost as much without stun.  Id recomend giving air pets some type of healing or mend and faster melee dmg output.  Just do something.  The only reason people complain more about the high lvl fire pet is because fire pets are good through most earlier levels but they never get used to using air pets since they always suck.<P>Earth pets are loved by a lot of mages who do not know how to fight without the sucky unreliable rooting effect.  I personally find these pets are totally useless.  They take too much damage, dont do enough, and cause obscene downtime because of their slow regen.  I havent used one in the last 20 levels.  I use water pets when soloing and fire pets in groups.<P>QUESTS:<BR>Ok, I talk about necros a lot because my real life friend plays a necro and we group all the time.  Necros have an abundance of cool quests spread out among pre-50 levels.  From the harvester to the words of darkness.  Not to mention the all the flayed skin and shadowed armor that has great stats and sell uber cheap.  Mages have **** for quests other than our early focus items which were cool.  I did those at lvl 19 by myself (travelling to area where items dropped and asking for them... obviously couldnt kill giants).  Since then I have not found any quest worth doing.  At one point I realized I had most of the items for the circlet of mist quest.  I looked it up and laughed when I found out it wasnt much better than a savants cap for all the effort it would take and I already had an elemental binder.<P>Unless you belong to MS or Da'kor I see little chance of anyone ever getting 1/2 their staves of master let along the epic item.   The main problem is that guilds want to get their clerics hooked up and other more useful classes.  Who is going to want to spend guild time getting a mage staff so his pet that gets everyone killed on raids will be a little buffer?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Forgot to mention this...<P>Pets and Spells Not Keeping Pace with the Increase in Mob and Equipment Power in Expansions:<P>In all of the recent expansions new weapons, armor, equipment has come out that has disproportionately increased the effectiveness of tanks in particular.  Tanks last longer and do more damage.  They also have new disciplines that make them more ... dare I say... uber.  Casters have recieved no upgrade that makes their spells more efficient or hit for more damage.  Perhaps the only thing we have gotten is some items that give us an insignificant mana increase and for most of us some crappy new novelty spells.  So not only are the effectiveness of our spells falling behind the times but so are our pets.<P>If you are looking for a defining raid role for the post 50 magician I say make our damage shields more uber and more group effective.  Make our epic a little easier to obtain.  Not only is it one of the hardest to get but it is one that guilds are also uninspired to help us get.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ick.  Don't give pets AE spells!  No one will ever want to group with a mage past 40 again, if the pets are breaking every mez, all the time, no matter what the mage is telling it to do.<P>* Lower the resist rates for all high level elemental attacks.  They're low damage anyway, and since the damage upgrade is *so* insignifigant from 49, I wouldn't think having these spells be nearly unresistable would be unbalancing -- frankly, I'm not sure it would be enough to make pets useful post-50, but it would be something, and a reasonable something at that.  This is the only change I think is really *necessary* to make pets useful past 50 again, besides fixing the blatantly busted fire pets.<P>Here's a couple more suggestions, that would add more flavor, and some additional use to pets post 50:<P>*  Give high level Earth Pets immunity to root and snare, and have them cast a low resist AE root upon *death*.  Include the caster in the AE.<P>*  Give high level Fire pets their damage shield back, and give them extreme fire resistance.  Have them cast an AE dmg spell upon death, like the shimmering sailfins in Kedge.  Include the caster in the AE.<P>*  Give high level Water pets extreme cold resist, and have them cast a short duration slow spell upon death -- maybe AE, maybe just on target.  If its AE, include the caster.<P>*  Give high level Air pets improved invis, and have them AE stun upon death.  Include the caster in the AE.<P>The caster should be included in the above AE death effects to prevent chain petting in some circumstances.  To compensate for this, add some higher level versions of the pet healing spells.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Pet buffs.   why are they targetable?   they should be yellow gems in the cast bar and cast only on the pet with no targeting.   <P>why when i have someone else targeted that is low level can i not cast my shield of the magi?  can't cast this spell on that being they are too low level.<P>being a higherlevel we should have better control of our pets and summons.   why don't we get a few commands at high level that allow us to better use our pets in situations where all the mobs are casting AoE.    for instance when fighting in chardok.   A LOT of the mobs there cast AoE spells.    after a couple of times the pets went nuts.   i mean really nuts.    they would hit one mob for two hits then hit something else for 5 then hit something different for a few more times before everyone was dead.   backing off didn't work and only real option was to kill all the pets but really what use is a mage if he can't control his pet?   we all know how to at this level and most are pretty damn good at it but there are some situations where different commands are needed   a /pet ignore attacker   command would have saved all the mages in that situation.     this should allow the pet to only attack the mob you sent him after.   is there still danger?  hmm  of course.   these mobs will kill the whole party if they aren't delt with correctly but are you also gonna make the magician useless in this situation to the point of liability?  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A few thingies Sir Absor...<P>Could mages get some Bolt and AoE conjuration based spells?  Mages are conjurers (and get that title at level 55 even) so it would make sense.  I specialized in conjuration, but at level 55 the last conjuration DD was at 44, and the next at 57.<BR>I think some AoE spells would be great (Liquid Steel) and some Bolts (Shrapnel) would be a great idea.<P>Also, mages are suposedly the masters of the elements.  We do get a pet of each element (Earth, fire, wind and water) but the only elemental damage spells we get are...fire?  I think we should get some water, earth and wind based spells.<P>The earth spells could have a great mana/damage ration, but a sluggish casting time. <BR>EX: Level 34: Boulder<BR>50 Mana<BR>220 Damage<BR>12 Second casting time<P>The spell does less damage than either of the spells attained at that level, but the ration is very nice.<P>Air would be very fast, but innificient. So, for an example...<P>Whirlwind<BR>Level 39<BR>190 Mana<BR>380 Damage<BR>3 Second casting time<P>It does slightly more damage than the level 34 Bolt, but half the casting time, and a mana ration which leaves something to be desired.<P>Fire...we have fire. (its about average)<P>Water would be do high damage, but be in-efficient.  So mages might get...<P>Hydro Blast<BR>Level 55<BR>Mana 420<BR>Damage 1111<BR>Casting time 5.5(not so sure on the casting time)<P>I would just like to have a little bit of variety, and have different spells for different situations...if I was in an exp getting group and was safe from getting bashed all the time, I could use the efficient, yet slow, earth spells.  If I was soloing I would probably use the fire spells.  If I got jumped while traveling, or our group did a bad pull, I might use the fast casting wind spells, or high damage water spells.<P>I think it would be fun to see these implemented, but it would probably make wizards upset, although it does fit the Vision for the mage class as being the masters of the elements.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I will admit that once I get to 60, and my epic( I've been lucky enough to get the earth staff) - I'm probably going to permanently retire as a mage.

</FONT><HR>Folks, we have to at least shoot for balance here when we post things.  Sure, I'd love to have all the things I can think of granted to me, but it won't happen.<P>&lt;&lt;1)2 second gate&gt;&gt;<BR>If Gate ever gets an upgrade, I'm thinking it's going to have to carry some penalty.  Ever seen a Druid try to Evac after they have picked up agro?  Evac spells up the Druids Agro immensely.  Same with Wizards I would expect.  If it get's updated, it would have to carry something similar.<P>&lt;&lt;2)1 second instant aggro removal for when we don't have pets up.&gt;&gt;<P>Ummm...can't see this happening.  No other class can do this, why would we?  Don't say Enchanters either.  Stun-Mez-Blur is how a Chanter clears agro.  Clerics, Root-Atone.  This one is way to unbalancing.<BR>&lt;&lt;3)Worldwide Call of Hero, lower mana cost&gt;&gt;<BR>This will never happen.  I see people asking for upgrades to Call all the time.  Not doable.  I am sure that the mechanics involved bringing something to you will make this impossible, let alone unbalancing.  Nothing summons across zones.  Call is really just a variation of the MoB power of Summoning, only they added Casting Time, Mana Cost, and a reagent to it and gave it to us.  Balance wise, I present this:<P>Guild_Mage_01 binds at Uber_Encounter_Location<BR>Guild gets word that Uber_Mob is up at said location<BR>Guild_Mage_01 joins group, Gates to Bind spot.<BR>Group_Leader_01 rotates people into group, Mage summons to spot, etc etc etc.  See the scenario?  Won't happen  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>&lt;&lt;4)100 stackable gems instead of 20&gt;&gt;<BR>Take this one a bit farther.  Instead of using the same gem and making us carry more and more as time goes on, just increase the cost of the gem.  IE, go, Cat's Eye, then Bloodstone, then....and so on.  Changing the way things stack is a complete re-tool of inventory.  Won't happen either.<P>&lt;&lt;5)Lower resists for all casters in the game&gt;&gt;<BR>I like this, in theory, but I really don't think resists are all that bad, except for spells that carry two checks.  But to lower them in Kunark/Velious MoBs I could really enjoy  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>&lt;&lt;6)Stun!&gt;&gt;<BR>We have this, in our Air Pets.  Should we have it another way?  I think perhaps, instead of saying Stun! letsd say, add some spells based on other Elements, such as a Air based DD that maybe carries a Stun component<P>&lt;&lt;7)High level pet heal&gt;&gt;<BR>Gotta agree here.  Needed, badly.<P>&lt;&lt;8)Post 50 pet dmg increase, no need for hps with a new heal spell.&gt;&gt;<BR>I don't think that damage increase is needed, but the hit tables do need to be looked at.  I'm comfortable with a 54 Pet (Max level and focused) hitting for Quad 58 and a Backstab.  In reality, it hits for, oh, double 36 a miss, and maybe a 50's hit.  And the miss is usually more than just one per attack cycle.<P>&lt;&lt;9)Fear resistant buff, pet and self only...make us desireable for certain raids.&gt;&gt;<BR>This is on Test, for pets.  For us, get that MR up!<BR>&lt;&lt;10)Mana regen buff...I'd be happy with Breeze.&gt;&gt;<BR>I would too  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>&lt;&lt;11)Change post 50 fire pets.&gt;&gt;<BR>No doubt.  Lame pets.<P>&lt;&lt;12)Our level 60 Malo spell should be level 58&gt;&gt;<BR>We have one, called Malosini, at 58.  Malo is different, it's unresistable.  60 is appropriate for this spell.<P>&lt;&lt;13)Elemental DD's---where are they?&gt;&gt;<BR>Agreed, we would do well for upgrades in this area.<P>&lt;&lt;14)Summon Chard thing needs some work.&gt;&gt;<BR>We get one usefull summons in Velious, and it's No Drop?  Just remove that tag, please, and change it to the Ammo slot.<P>This isn't meant to flame the poster in this case of the original, just to remind Mages to keep Balance in mind.

</FONT><HR>A few thoughts...<P>Mod Rods ~<BR>Charges on mod rods would be a dream come true. =) And, if I actually had this, I might even use that silly phantom armor line once in a while...  As it is now, of course, I have no real desire to shell out the cash for the reagents, since I'm not going to be hit enough in any situation to make the cost (mana or money) worthwhile to me.<P>Pets vs Ubermobs ~<BR>A lot of the high-end magician's problems stem from the fact that they simply -can't- damage the high-end mobs, either with DD, or pet.  Now, I'm not asking for a pet damage increase (It'd be nice, but I find the chances of it remote), but what I -would- like to see is the pet increased simply in level.  So that at least it's not staring at an ubermob that's 15 levels higher than it and will never be able to touch it.  We know a lot in this game is based on the simple fact of levels (can't nuke blood-red-con mobs, etc), so bump up the pet's level and base offense skill so that we can actually put out some damage on these 99.9% MR mobs.<P>Focus items ~<BR>Can we -please- get some of these that work post-50?  I don't really mind having to do convoluted quests, just as long as I don't have to spend more than a session of playing on it.  (Epics are something else, and I don't even want to go there.  I've long since resigned myself to the fact that I'm never going to summon a Master of Elements)  If I can set aside a Saturday and go in search of some arcane bits and pieces that'll make my post-50 pets more powerful, by Zek I'm going to do it.<P>There are, of course, other things, but they've been more or less covered by everyone else already... and I've pretty much been reiterating them anyway.<P>Okami Tokio Kageriyume<BR>53 Tier'dal Elementalist<BR>Mistress of the Arcane<BR>Dragonknights Council<BR>Prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, from thinking about it, i feel we should minimally get a snair spell. something to let us out run mobs, but i think post 50 mage soloing could be increased by two things: higher pet hp and better attack, secondly a pet heal thats worth while, a complete heal would be awesome. <P>Why i think this is, you pull a mob, i like mal line, but some start with dd. when pet engaes(assuming it doent beet on you first) by the time you cast your first spell the pet will be at 70% or less, by the second cast 30%, then dead before you can cast a third. Allowing us an effective way off keeping a pet is great, but like a cleric complete heal taking 10 seconds, if we got one like that, we would have to chain CH on our pet cause 10 seconds our pet gets eaten up by most 50+ mobs, so increase hp and attack, so we could at least, blast/heal blast/heal. Snair would help for  the times we are walking and get agroed by greens, and when our pets dont taunt well enough and we get ran after. post 50 we cannot out solo in outdoor areas.<P>As far as indoor zones, pathing sucks for the most part. I usually summon a pet for spawns and detory before i move anywhere in a dungeon, cause they can really get you in trouble.  i think if we could get maybe a down graded lure line like wizzies, we get good blasts(not that of a wiz but we have the pets to make up the difference) but blasts arent any good if you can land them, and with the uber HP and MR/FR of RoK and SoV mobs we get screwed. Why shouldnt we get some blasts post 50 that have decent chances of landing, paired with pet melee we can be the damage dealing source we were pre 50. with the if we could do the damage post 50, like pre 50 AND the pathing problems got fixed, we would be welcome in groups again I'm sure. Unless this gets fixed, mages are often just a weak warrior for many purposes or get mal duty and pass out mod rods.<P>Oh yeah, the 50+ fire plus eats it it big, for god sakes, make it based on another class than a wizard.<P>Also  spell drops, its highway robbery when we have to buy 50+ spells, and some are so rare you just cant find tem(muzzle i just havent been able to get)<P>Thats it i think, many good suggestions along the way i may add, but i know we wont get most of them, i kept moine as realistic as I could , but still far fetched i think.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have to Agree will all my fellow mages. When i firts started playing Eq, back in '99 i love it. Being a mage was the best class. Our summons where good, pets rocked, mages were ALWAYS welcome to groups, but things changed.<BR>I have gotten very pissed off at the game designers at verant interactive. They have no creativity what soever.<BR>Im a mage,  Master of the Elements, By that, were supposed to be able to COntrol Air, water, fire, earth. and in relatuion to that we SHould AND MUST have these types of spells. Summonoing a pet is not the same as supposively "being the master of the elements."<BR>Mages have gotten ****ed up the a$$ in this game. Towards the end we get the shttiest items, the stupidest summoning spells.<BR>Why wont they give us things the WE can use. All of ous summons are just usefull to other players.<BR>MAges were intended to be a solo class. Why do we get items that we cant use? Why at higher levels you keep giving us ****ty summons? We dont WANT to SUMMON Party items, we want USEFULL items, our pets need to be nerfed up to increase attack. <BR>ABSOr, take a close look at ALL the Class threads. NOtice something?Anything? Look at the number of complaints? MAges have one of the longest lists. IF any class needs to be fixed, you should start with us. You guys are loosing cusatomers cause ya are pissing the **** off of all the mages. Make the class fun again, if your having such a hard time coming up with ideas, play a few games of Final Fantasy and some of those ideas implement it into the game, you oknow, for example:<BR>You attack a fire mob with you bolt, in change the mob will absorb it because they ARE fire,<BR>Hit cold with fire, fire with ice, see my logic?<BR>This game has the stupidest implementation of magic/hit effects.<BR>We also need ice spells, air(like a tornado spell) that you can use against flying mobs like a griffon, and in change will do more damage than say a fire spell, earth(we need a root spell really bad).<BR>and why the **** did you guys implement research? its not like we need it after lvl 49, i wasted so many practice point to bring it up, to later find out that i wont be able to use the reserch skill because all of our spells are dropped by npc's why always get killed by other classes(because no one wants a mage in their group), and then selling it for extreme amounts of money or items, which brings me to another point, the fact that we dont get to go to raids is another problems, if we cant get our hands on rare items, we wont be able to attain the spells we really need, i seen Call of the Hero go for like 15k un my server (quellious) this game is just getting too ridiculous. If you dont do something about these issues, verant is going to loose alot of customers, shadowbane will be out VERY soon, so i assum you get your people to get creative or hire a new staff, cause they are just not cutting it. YOu guys have ****ing morons taking care of tha games things. Im really starting to get upset with this game. The mage is the only class i everliked since day one.but as time passes, we just jkeep getting dicked, over and over, ABSOR please make this madness stop. Make the mage the class once was...give us what we need, supply us with spells we can use, givew us water, earth , wind spells, give us a variety to choose, we have been stuck with the same spells for ever, all we get is upgrades, we dont want ****ing upgrades , we wannt variety and please stop giving all of ous spells to other classes.. because that really sux.your truly,<BR>****Nyctech Xtreme****<BR>Mage of the 44th Season<BR>Quellious Server<BR>Norraths Foreign Legion<BR>Even though our pets got a few abilites, past 50, the pets abilities are no use to us whatsoever</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
