</FONT><HR>Here is a quote from today's Patch Message:<BR> <BR>"Rangers, Paladins and Shadowknights casting non-beneficial spells that have casting times greater than or equal to 3 seconds, now get a 3 % reduction in casting time for each level over 50. 3% at 51, 6% at 52, etc., to 30% at 60. Again, this applies only to non-beneficial spells."<BR> <BR>Looks to me as if Verant could make a Caster Haste spell pretty easily, because the mechanisms are already in the code for speeding up casting times for a particular class, caster, and spell type.  <BR> <BR>Haste items and spells for Melee are common as mud.  Int casters need a form of haste too.  A Melee class can have their (manaless) damage output increased by a large percentage when hasted by an Enchanter, wouldn't it be swell if a Wizard could cast a haste-type spell on you that would give your (mana-dependent) direct damage spells a speed boost?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There is caster haste.  It's called Clarity.<P>Casting spells just isn't the same as swinging weapons.  Sure, for a single fight at the lower levels, lower casting time can make it easier to kill a monster... but as you go up in levels, your damage output is limited by your mana pool and how fast it comes back.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

In the 20 to 40 game having faster casting times can reduce interuptions even while your being hit...

</FONT><HR>ahh, hybrids got the "spell haste" cause they lose mellee dmg when casting in combat. I think if anyone gets a spell haste, it should be wizzies, and self only.

At 3.5 secs you can still lose a lot of mellee dmg, you can even lose close to 300dmg in mellee, even after the change to spell resets.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, sorry all you casters out there, it's just that I've been hammered OVER AND OVER in the last couple weeks with the concept that dmg/second is irrelevant in the high-level game, because all it means is you dump your whole mana bar a little faster.  I keep seeing that between high HP mobs and managing aggro, how *fast* you can do your 12,000 points of damage is totally, completely IRRELEVANT.<P>Anyone want to take that back in light of this thread?<P>Ok, then let's move on.<P>If what I said above is the case, then "caster haste" consists of two things: (1) mana regen speed and (2) dmg/mana ratio.<P>Mana is analogous to stamina ONLY in the mechanical sense of how it works.  No melee has to stop fighting completely for five minutes while the stamina bar refills, or empties the whole bar on one mob before its half dead.<P>Like I said, at the lower levels some casters will benefit from what you're suggesting, but it would not have a consistent, scalable benefit into the high-level game.<P>So, thanks for all the yelling at me about reading... It really made me feel like coming back and explaining myself would do any good.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Again, this applies only to non-beneficial spells."<P>Looks to me as if Verant could make a Caster Haste spell pretty easily, because the mechanisms are already in the code for speeding up casting times for a particular class, caster, and spell type. <P>Haste items and spells for Melee are common as mud. Int casters need a form of haste too. A Melee class can have their (manaless) damage output increased by a large percentage when hasted by an Enchanter, wouldn't it be swell if a Wizard could cast a haste-type spell on you that would give your (mana-dependent) direct damage spells a speed boost?"<P>Now, a few points, <BR>1. Clarity (et.al.) is comparable to regen for a melee types and both are already implemented in the game.  <BR>2. Gryndel-Rathe's idea of mana "healing" is equal to healing HPs for melee types and only hp healing is implemented in the game.<BR>3. We can see that the coding makes it possible to "haste" casting times based on spell type and class.  Melee types already have haste spells and items to help them output more damage/round.  Only melee type of haste is implemented in the game.<P>Here are the questions, <BR>Why hasn't VI implemented any type of mana "healing"?  If it is acceptable for Clerics to be the masters of HP healing, it should be acceptable for A pure caster type to be the masters of mana "healing".<BR>Why hasn't VI implemented any type of casting "haste"?  If it is acceptable for melee types to get haste buffs, procs and effects, it should be acceptable for casting types to get casting "haste" buffs, procs and effects.<P>I do not think that there is a defensible position on this from VI's point of view.  I have tried to reason that mana "healing" would make caster types way over powered, but I also see that if the mana healing were implemented in the same way as HP healing, it would no more overpower a caster than warriors are now.  Also, there is no reason for there to not be casting "haste" items and buffs in the game.<P>One final question,<BR>How is it reasoned that the hybrids, who do magic as a sideline along with their melee ability, can get better and faster at casting spells, while the pure casters, who have virtually no melee skill and concentrate solely on magic ability, can not get better and faster at casting spells?<P>While obviously the spell costs/mana gained need tweaked, the concept is sound.<P>Nill<BR>Tribunal<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There is something *very* much like "mana healing" in the game... the Necromancer's mana transfer series.  In two steps, they turn HP into mana, and give mana to other casters.  HP healing turns blue bar on one person to red on another, and necros can turn their red bar into blue on themselves and others.<P>The only problem is that necromancers are not happy with this role.  I'm not positive anyone would be, really.<P>You can sit there and say that increased mana regen is nothing like haste for casters, but you're contradicting a good portion of *all* the caster class talk threads in doing so.  Makes it look pretty silly.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

To ME, a faster casting time and faster spell recovery time would ROCK.<BR> <BR>Sure, in Scars of Velious, there is a completely different problem, because of monsters with massive hitpoints and high resistances.  That is not what I am addressing here.  I am pointing out that Caster Haste is not only POSSIBLE, but the mechanics are already built into the game.<BR> <BR>For the pre-50 spell casters of ALL classes, not JUST the Wizards (hey, sorry I mentioned my own class as an example. That this turned into yet another Wizard thread is actually too bad since those issues are being covered exhaustively elsewhere), Caster Haste would be a way of introducing more strategies into the game.  Certain spells that got exiled to the back of the spellbook will find their way into use again.  Magicians and Enchanters have a lot to gain, since Mage spells are slow-casting and Chanters need a fast mez sometimes in a bad situation.<P>I'm sorry I mentioned Wizards at all.  This is a CASTER issue, not a Wizard issue.  I was half-joking when I made that Wizard buff suggestion.  Truthfully, I'd prefer to see it as a Magician Summoned Item than anything else.<BR> <BR>How about a Magician spell at level 20 that summons an all/all Circlet (head slot item) that gives mana regen like a Breeze spell, and a 5% Caster Haste.  Then, at 39, the Circlet would give Clarity type regen and 10% Caster Haste.  Continue the upgrades at 49 and 59, for Clarity2 and 15% and 20% Caster Haste.<BR> <BR>It would be the Magician's most popular summoning, would get the same kind of respect a Teleport, SoW, or Clarity (which should stack with the Circlet's effect) would get, and would be the very next thing a Mage summoned after food and drink on login.<BR> <BR>Sure, sounds Monty Haul, but there are much better items than that available as rentable drops for Melees.  The Flowing Black Silken Sash and the Fungal Tunic spring readily to mind.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Yes, we Necromancers are the mana healing class.  But we SUCK at it.  The ratio is HORRIBLE.  We really don't "heal" enough mana to make a great deal of difference.  We're there because there were a few extra slots and you could use a few hundred extra mana at the cost of one dead Necro (see Lich and HP loss).  Since we can't tap our health back on uber raids our Lich line kills us very very quickly.  And what kind of a contradiction would it be for the cleric heal the necro who should be feeding said cleric mana.  Ugh.  Solution?  Throw in a cleric to heal the necros.  No, wait.

Verant wants us to be mana healers?  Fine!  But make us good at it.  Give us better ratio on subversion line.  Give us a mana bar to watch like clerics watch health.

</FONT><HR>Natan, class envy can only HURT the Wizards, not help us.  When someone has an idea that helps all casters, and a Wizard says "No, make it Wizard self-only," it makes ALL Wizards look petty and selfish to the other classes.<BR> <BR>Fixing the Wizard class is a separate (but I agree related) issue to fixing the post-Kunark/Velious weakness of damage casting in general.  This weakness is only most apparent in Wizards because of our total dependence upon damage casting, the other damage casters suffered from Kunark and Velious too.<BR> <BR>So please, fellow Wizards, let's not toss out an idea just because it might help other damage casters as much as it helps us.  Anything that helps damage casting WILL help Wizards, that is how we are designed.  And we will have much more community support for improvements to our class if we can show that we are not merely being selfish, but really want to make a contribution to the overall enjoyment of EQ.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I know I probably make too many comparisons between EQ and D&D, but when my D&D Mage casts Haste on himself, he gets to cast two spells per round instead of one.  He can move and then cast in his Hasted round.  Whether he casts on himself or on another, the target for the next 5 minutes gets two turns per round instead of one.<BR> <BR>For some reason, even with the algorithms compatible with Caster Haste, EQ doesn't have it.  It just doesn't make any sense from a gaming perspective.  Sure, my Hasted Mage runs out of spells faster when he casts twice per round, but when fighting dragons, every time the dragon breaths on your party you stand a chance of being wiped out.  I need to be able to run and cast Polymorph Other in the same round, or I will not get a second chance (my Mage can't survive a Dragon Breath even if he makes his roll, at least not while staying conscious or Gods forbid, casting a spell).<BR> <BR>Bring on that Caster Haste baby!   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Thanks Friday...I was about to scream.<P>I've played a wizard and a mage and there's one thing I don't think many wizards have given thought of about mages.  <P>We're travelling and invis fails...we're dead to even lower greens.  <P>We're travelling with a pet (god forbid) and aggro something...we're ok.  We aggro something else...we're dead to even lower greens.<P>Wizards have root and then an AoE snare so they have some means of escape...albeit rather unreliable.<P>Add in the fact that our pet spells (not the ones we cast to summon them, but the ones the pets cast on the mob)...well, they suck.  Too many mobs resist stuns so the air pet is limited in use, earth root fails WAY too often to be of decent use, fire (*falls down in gales of laughter*), water...well, water's ok.  The DD is halfway decent, but I'd generally prefer that he keep attacking.  <P>NOW add in that the vast majority of our item summons are...well...worthless...and you're starting to see some angst in the magician clans.<P>Now...make it so that our FIRE based spells are nicely resisted by...oh...ICE BASED BLUES even when they are MALISED and a wizard standing next to you that is three levels lower than you is relatively regularly hitting for more damage than you and you'll start losing your mind.<P>Don't get me wrong, I'm not calling for a wizard nerf...quite the opposite...I'm calling for a wizard buff!  A haste/breeze item would be a nice thing if it was NOT a superrare drop.  In fact, to make it a level 30-44 summoned mage item would be perfect.  It would increase the effectiveness of all casters and give groups a reason to want mages.<P>Side note...to make the uber raids caster friendly...<P>Since most of them are casters, and powerful as a mug on top of that, why not make the vast amounts of magic in the area increase mana regeneration to a relatively insanely high level and then REDUCE RESISTS!  Lures don't cut it since they don't do the damage!  <P>AGAIN...Reduce resists on the high level mobs, give wizzies some HUGE damage rain spells, and give all casters higher mana regen if they're within a certain area around a supremely magic steeped creature.<P>Sub</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I hear ya Nill, I hate raw bumpage as much as the next person, but there are actually some very good ideas in this thread, and a surprisingly low flame content too.
