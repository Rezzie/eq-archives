</FONT><HR>I would like my faction back.<P>I was basically told, by Verant, that if I trashed my faction, and was lucky in PoG, that I could get this item.  I evaluated the item, the risk, the reward, all factors involved.  I chose to take the BP.<P>Now, the item which I trashed my faction for is so bad that I would NEVER had made that choice, knowing that it would end up the way it is now.<P>As for the new effect, I hope that Verant actually takes the time to TEST (4 letter word at Verant apparently) the item BEFORE the public gets it.  Sorry, the public is tired of testing your items for you, and then having you destroy these items after the fact.  How about you take the item, and have the people who you PAY to test your game actually do something with it?  Can you imagine the consequences of them placing an effect on the new bp that ends up getting nerfed in 3-4 months, because it "damages the integrity of the game"?  If the integrity of the game is so important to Verant, that they would enrage so many players over it, then I would think that they would have the COMMON SENSE to test these things ahead of time.<P>And personally, I don't buy this garbage about the CE effect damaging the integrity of the game.  It does absolutely NOTHING until about lvl 45, because it simply can't be cast on anybody below that level.  It does NOTHING in ANY large Kunark or Velioius encounters, because it is simply too slow and takes too long to cast.  The ONLY thing it can do is help people level from 45-60 a little bit faster than before.  Of course, this is a cardinal sin for Verant, because it allows people to level quicker, which makes them more likely to quit.  It has NOTHING to do with keeping in line with the "Vision" or anything like that, it ONLY effects what matters most to Verant:  The almighty dollar. If people hit 60 faster than they predicted when they were calculating estimated revenue, then their income will be effected.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Suggestion for new effect:<P>Aegolism<P>While your at it compare the caster robes to the priest chest items.  Your giving level 44 & useless spells (rune 4, pfft maybe if it didn't cost a peridot, didn't take 30 seconds to cast and actually had decent hit points compared to rune 5) on caster robes.  Then you give level 59 spells that are very useful to the priest classes.  Thanks for the consideration in SoV, glad your caring about us casters.<P>On another note you guys add 12 new plate graphics per race/gender in the game and not one of them is a robe.  What is even worse is that you have tinted the robes to be all the same.  PoG Mage, PoG enchanter and Yelinak robe all look the same, come on and give us something new too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I wonder what it will take for VI to realize how much money they are going to loose if they keep screwing with thier game their are 48479 players online right now, Normally there are twice that online you have already Lost countless Players becuase of this Nerf, i am sorry are you to blind to see that with hard work and and skill you come a reward. that reward was the PoG BP.<P>I wonder how many of your employees you will have to lay off becuase half your CLIENT  base does nto log on after Tuesdays patch, you all went to school right you know how to do math take 40000 customers that pay you 10$ a month you should make 400000$ right well that is a little less than HaLF YOUR CLIENT BASE. Your company will lose all this money becuase your staff are not smart enough to test an item before sending it LIVE, people have explained to you that this item does nto help in the High level encounters but assists in down time so what it saves us a few minutes in healing time. it just gives us a little more time to Play the game we have all enjoyed up to this time. <P>I am sorry you dont test items before you send them Live.<P>I am sorry you are going to lose Money and future Busness becuase of your mistake.<P>I am sorry I have played a game for 2 years and the company that is hosting the game DOES NOT GIVE A ****!!!!<P>these people are not asking for uber weapons that kill in one shot its a healing Item for god sakes.<P>I hope you are smarter than I think you are and decide not to Patch tommorow , becuase if you do you will lose alot of players. <P>Things cant last forever EVERQUEST bahh if you put to much work into something you wreck it.<P>Listen to us we pay your bills.<P>/ponder<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I say leave it how it is except up the cast time or make the refresh time longer. I feel this would not upset the Clerics as much as taking it away altogether. <P>It's great for healing someone after they have been rezzes. You can move onto the next corpse and rezz them while another cleric uses the BP to heal them. This way the clerics have the mana to get people rebuffed to move on. <P>Dragon raids are long enough and yes they should be for the ARE dragons. Getting people there, orginizing and buffing up should be the longest part not the CR afterwards. <P>You have done a great job of putting Dragons in the game and it's most exciting now. People actually have something to look forward to.<P>Sometimes the dragons go down the first try, but most take more then one try and sometimes 3 or 4. The down time is a killer for not everyone can stay on 24/7. <P>Up the cast time or the refresh time on it so it will not effect the healing on the actual battle and make it so Clerics actually have to use mana.<P>Within minutes either everyone is dead or the dragon is. You do not see failed raids because the clerics are out of mana. I do not have a PoG BP yet and I have yet to be oom when the dragon is actually killed. <P>So make the Clerics use mana, but please leave the BP as it is but up the cast time or the refresh time. (wow can I repeat myself or what :P)<P>Giving it a new effect IMO is not the answer.<P>Hold off on the change a little longer and try to look at it again and discuss it a bit more.<P>Lizwulf Smiles<BR>59th Cleric of Bristlebane<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>First off, Absor, I would like to thank you for your consideration, and keeping with this thread that affects so many of us, and listening to our suggestions and rants all this time. I present my case to you, with my first hand experience with the Breastplate of Stability (Forbidden Rites/Templar's, or whatever, hehe)And possible choices for the BP's new effect, if the change must be made<P>Now, to beat a dead horse as it were, I'd like to stress that the Breastplate is nothing more then a tool to make our lives easier (And do that it did, and well)  <P>Did it define my class, and my own techniques? No, but it did add to them. <P>Did it create an overpowering imbalance? Perhaps, but what can it do that I cannot do already? As it stands, I can chain cast Celestial Healing, and keep a tank just as healthy, and keep myself full mana, assuming I have a Clarity behind me. I can assume I can do this just as well at 59, with Celestial Elixer, and still med to full before the end of the spell. In fact, that is easier to me, as I waste less time casting the actual spell, then the BP, and frees me up in case the unforseen occurs, which it so often does.<P>Is 1500 hp too much, at 300 hp a tick? Again, maybe, but thats all circumstantial. Is 300 every six seconds, enough against Cazic Thule? No. Is it enough against a sebilis frog? Again, probably no. If you find 1500 too much, make the BP's effect, Celestial healing, with a 20 second casting delay. That makes the BP only heal 200 hp a tick, much much less, as things go, and still usable.<P>Again, is the BP the only thing I've used, while it was in my possesion? No, I have not demem'd my CH and Cel Healing, and Remedy, I used them just as often. Did it increase my efficiency in battle? Yes, and thats the exact point of getting better equipment, to do more damage, or take less, or heal more. Did it save me med time? Yes, it did, but was it more then I could've done alone, while still keeping myself at full mana? No, it was not. In fact I challenged myself to go into a camp in the Hole without using my bp once, and I kept a full party healthy with my spells, and remained consistantly full mana even when things took a bad turn.<P>As the BP was, I found it a great tool, but never replaced my skills and my spells, no matter how hard I tried the day before patch, hoping I could use it for all its worth *Grin*<P>In conclusion, I propose you reconsider your change in light of that it does not do what a cleric cannot do already, if he has his wits and skill with him, and if ye still find a change needed, make it Celestial Healing, with the same casting time, to keep its usefulness alive. Also, another suggestion, is to give the Breastplate a unique effect, exactly like the Celestial Elixer spell, excepting it draws much more agro upon the caster, Maybe 3-5 times normal would make it a double edged sword, without destroying it completly. If it is determined that a healing effect of any sort is too much, I suggest giving the breastplate a unique effect of another sort, as unfortunatly the cleric profession does not offer many good spells to tack on to items *Chuckle* <P>Again, Absor, I appreciate you taking the time to listen to our opinions on this subject. I know it means a lot to me, at least, and I'm sure all of us, that you are there listening to us and our opinions regarding the change =)<P>Silverspark Soulmender<BR>55 Templar of the Triad Continuum, Luclin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>  I honestly haven't read all the posts about this, not even close, but I gotta throw in my two cents anyway. Really, it's just about the one minute casting time. I mean, that's quite a bit. Absor, or whoever, click your mouse once, and then scoot back a bit, and count to 60. Quite a bit of time, eh? I really only have one high level cleric friend, and he probably won't see this breastplate, so it really doesn't effect me...but still. One minute? </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>On the subject of the new effect:<P>Every caster BP has an effect that they are the absolute best at, that no other spell tops.  Wizard lure, shaman stamina buff, enchanter rune, necro summon corpse, etc.<P>If you put Aegolism on the BP, it will be made inferior by the druid spell Protection of the Glades.<P>The only thing clerics are best at is healing.  We WERE the best at buffing, but instead of giving us an upgrade to heroism for our 60 velious spell, we kinda got dicked with Aegolism that was made inferior by Protection of the Glades in the same spell set.<P>So, if you want my opinion for what can be done, make a NEW buff for the breastplate, that does for melee what Protection of the Glades does for tanks.<P>Chivalry:  HP +500 AC +25 Atk +25<BR>Or something similar.<P>Regardless, this kind of necessitates a new spell.  None of our old buff spells would be worthy of a breastplate this hard to obtain.  None of our healing spells are acceptable in your eyes for the BP.<P>Finnien, 60 Cleric<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There is one item I have not yet seen touched upon. It is being assumed that the mob in question is staying on one target, the warrior with many hps. This is NEVER the case. As I'm sure many of you know, warriors are having a hard enough time keeping the creature taunted onto them while it tears apart rangers, enchanters, the wizzie who overnuked, etc. Will this BP, which already has a 20 second casting time, help the cleric keep up with an entire party that needs healing? No. Oh, and when the cleric uses their mana-consuming heals to help the rest of the party the mob will be on them and the warrior who had CE cast upon them about 15 or so seconds ago still can't taunt it off.<P><BR>Wychway Darkmink - 44 warrior<BR>Sivone Snowcat - 23 cleric<BR>Bristlebane server - Force of Norrath<P>And please, don't say a thing about my levels and not knowing what I'm talking about.

</FONT><HR>Perhapse a different method would be a rechargeable bp. Your bp comes with 5 charges and a spell that would recharge it somehow when cast. Taking x mana, component, etc... This way you could use the effect a limited number of times before you had to recharge it. In a sense allowing you to store heals before battle but not heal endlessly. <P>This would allow for more rewarding items to be placed in game without destroying balance. <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Regarding Healing Breastplates:<BR>I was once told by my father at a young age of the Six P's.  I believe it went something like this...<P>"Poor Prior Planning equals Piss Poor Performance"<P>Perhaps this is a creed that our friends at Verant should more closely follow.  Even since the beginning of Ruins of Kunark Verant KNEW that healing items were unbalancing - Deepwater Helm.  Thus I question how they could continually add healing items to the game already knowing they would have to be "nerfed."  <P>After pondering this for a matter of hours, the answer my friends is quite simple: Marketing.  People often think of Verant as a place where dreams are made and destroyed.  Often times its looked at as a horrible menace that is out to "get" the players.  Other times it's praised for its good customer service (sorry not often).  However Verant Interactive is, in short, a corporation.  A company made to create profits both for Sony and it's employees.  Then you must think to yourself... how on earth has it attracted players to this game for so long?  Most games people get tired of after a few months.<P>There are three ways which Verant keeps revenue incoming:<BR>1) Adding Expansions<BR>2) Adding better items<BR>3) Creating a more challenging environment<P>The first one attracts players because it adds entire new continents full of great items.  You notice when RoK first open things like Sarnak Earrings of Station were dropping like crazy.  No drop, incredible items that could only be obtained through purchasing the expansion.  More obvious is the Plane of Growth.  Items better than those that drop off level 70 dragons dropped in this weak, 2 group zone.  Now THAT's marketing.  How could any player in their right mind not want to spend a mediocre 15 to 20 dollars to get some of the most incredible items in the game.<P>Well, that covers #1 and #2, how about #3... nerfing these incredible items.  Verant knew when they added these items to the game that they would be overpowered, but they saw a chance to increase their revenues so they did it anyway.  Now, unfortunately, after several months people have adjusted to this new style of gameplay and exploited it (in the eyes of verant).  This is unacceptable, because once people learn to easily defeat monsters they become less and less interested in the game.  Just like any game you played as a child, once you beat it, you tossed it to the side.  Verant does not want you to toss its game to the side because then their earnings would fall.  Therefore they created a more challenging environment by reducing the effectiveness of many items that attracted players to purchased Velious in the first place.  This, in the long run, will increase profits and keep more people attracted to the game.<P>You may ask why I am writing this?  Well I am just sick of people saying "Verant Hates druids!" or "Damn you verant, what do you have against necros?!"  You must understand that Verant does not hate anyone, they simply love money.<P>Now, I could sit here all day and break down Verant's motivations, but how exactly would that help with the current breastplate nerfs?  It wouldnt.  Thus I will offer my own suggestions.<P>The breastplates that are being nerfed should NOT have had the same effect in the first place.  Good god it is 10x as hard to get an Akkirus' breastplate over a Chestplate of Stability.  Therefore, there needs to be a hierarchy of spells on these breastplates.  Beginning with the most difficult to obtain casting something along the line of a Group Aegolism (if a cleric can obtain a breastplate of such a high level, he deserves to save some peridots here and there) with perhaps a 45second - 1minute cast time which makes it ineffective during battle.  The next breastplate down could possible cast a single target aegolism, again with the ineffective cast time.  Moving down the line, the breastplates should cast spells that are useful to a cleric but not imbalancing.  These include high level stuns, dd's, buffs, and maybe even a new spell only attainable by the breastplate (and no, I dont mean anything like the fantastic new CH on donals bp).  In this way, Verant can reward people for attaining high level items, maintain game balance, and reduce the amount of "nerfs" necessary in this game.<P>In conclusion, I write that I do not resent Verant for their activities.  I am sure if I was in their position, and was in pursuit of money I would probably do the same thing.  However, I must add that their lack of future planning is disappointing.  Verant I encourage you to think ahead when you make the changes on the breastplates, please do not tease us again.  Thank you.<P>Sincerely,<BR>Xavion Redcross &lt;Enlightened Dark&gt;<BR>High Priest of Bristlebane<BR>Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here's a thought.<BR>The item has been removed due to it having an unbalancing aspect. Perhaps we need to have Tunare debuffed some then?<P>After all even clerics with 300 point regen per tick BP's (as absor put it) can not possibly handle the nastiness of Tunare and her guardians. Or, how about the forbidden area in Kael? The area where everything is red and yellow to a 60 and is always scowling ready to attack. To my knowledge no one has dropped Tunare and no one has cleared this area of Kael, not even WITH the evil and terribly unbalancing pre-nerfed breastplates.<P>I have no problem with nerfing us and our items to make us more "balanced" as long as you are willing to take a look at some of the well nigh impossible areas of your game and make them "more balanced" also.<P>While you are at it why remove the BP from the game? Why not have the BP drop with the same stats and no effect? Then when the final effect is agreed upon and implemented allow clerics to trade their no effect BP for the new BP.<P>Removing the item from the loot tables only discourages players to take their clerics to the zone, which overall affects the entire population of the playerbase not just clerics.<P>VI Staff: Please think about all of the implications before you do something.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am a level 60 cleric and have played this character since the Tribunal opened.  So I have a little clerical experience regarding obtainable itmes.  About armor:  Every piece of armor I now own (Thurgadin quest or Donals) has a useless affect that I will never use nor could I use even as a toy.  I use to own a Donals breastplate but its affect became useless when it was increased to a 30second cast time not the recent 7.5minute recast time.  30 seconds is too long to neglect the rest of your team.  This allowed me to work on and receive a quest breasplate out of Thurgadin.  Would I have done this quest if there had been no affect on the breastplate?  Yes, because I was helping my friends get there items in the process.<P>From experience, I know my friends and anyone that groups with me will still be alive and safe at the end of the day despite this 60 Second slap in the face.  You can't kill me and you can't kill my friends, Verant, so stop trying.  This breastplate won't help in bad pull situations, won't help in guild raids, I still had the same amount of downtime I had without it when grouping with my friends.  Sure I could be full mana at the end of a fight with this bp, but I still had to sit and wait for the rest of my friends to regain mana.  <P>Your going to try and appease clerics now by putting some new affect on the breastplate.  I'm pretty sure you guys already know what your going to replace it with so I'm not going to bother with a suggestion.  I'm sure it will be something just as useless and unrewarding as the rest of the affects placed on the armor.<P>Someone in my guild loves to spout of analogies.  So I guess its rubbing off on me.  I'm guessing some of the employees went to one school or another so they could get this nice job with a nice salary.  Now lets have the company come along with ye ole nerf stick and cut your salary in half and boot half your friends off the workforce.  Would you be screaming?  I would think so.  Would you have looked elsewhere for a job if you knew your salary was going to be cut in half? I certainly hope so.  Now take another look at your customers.  Would they have ruined faction?  Would they have worked their butts off to get these nerfed items?  Doubtful in many cases. Take a second look at your customers Verant, we're not all cheats.<P>If you read this far I'm amazed.  Aliari, I love you.  Thanks for sticking up for me.  I won't hit that cancel button until the competition comes up with something equivalent.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Downside on this is how do you get the BP to cast a spell dependant on religion.. probably more chance of getting it on a spell I guess since you can have different spells for different religions. <P>Mana regen spells:<P>Something like harvest would be nice.. since the BP is aimed at reducing downtime/mana cost.<P>Perhaps a self only breeze?  something that stacks with enc buffs though cos enc in group/on raid would make it worthless.. like druids mask of the howler or PotG.<P>Healing:<P>Well since CE is just obviously too powerful (how about nerfing some of the other caster armour that  cast DD's/DoTs.. they can do infinate damage and can start doing damage right from the beginning of the combat the same way our heals can heal from the start of combat.) how about Celestial Healing.. or perhaps it's the HOT (Heal over Time) that you don't like in which case make it a 1500-2000hp  heal with 14 second cast?  that way we get your precious aggro that your so worried about but we can't have it constantly healing the tank like your worried about..  it reduces downtime but isn't so exploitable..<P>Or how about a manafree slightly enchanced MoK.. 10hp per hit primary hand hits only?  This was a good innovative spell..  still a HoT but 8hp per hit primary only isn't going to keep a tank alive.. it's definately not going to heal 300hp per tick.  This would actually make people want to group more since it's more effective the more people hitting on mob..  It would also guarantee not to be used in a uber fight since reverse DS's cause as many LD's as normal DS's so would get banned from use on uber mobs (who it wouldn't stick to anyway) instantly by any guild with half a brain.  Of course if you ever get around to implementing server side filters you may have to nerf it again.. but the chances of that are slim so it's a good bet..<P>DD's/DOT's:<P>Our Pet spell..  if they do the changes to the pet so it can't be reposted to death with one hit a mana free version might be worthwhile.  It is after all the mana and the fact it insta dies with reposte that makes our pet the useless pile of trash it is.<P>Manafree retribution anyone?<P>Summon Spells:<P>Summon Manastone (5 charge manastone works anywhere) no rent, no drop, no chance..<P><BR>Stupid but most likely to happen suggestions:<P>+20% slow in /gem game?<BR>Cleric only uber gem mode?<P>Summon Nubile Wood Elf Lapdancer for something to do while we're sat on our asses. (after we tire or /gem)<P>Summon Fireworks - *shrug* sommat nice to look at while sat on butt being bored stiff medding.<P>Summon Warrior/Rogue - Since apparently this is all we need to group with.  Summons the nearest Warrior/Rogue to you from anywhere in the zone.  Cancels the tank's hate.<P>Yaulp IV (Bookies current favourite for implementation by VI)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A CHALLENGE!!!!!<P>Here it is.  If you want to back up your opinion that this item is "unbalancing" and <BR>"overpowered".  I propose this test to either recant what you have said and done or prove it to the rest of the EQ community.  Port me and a warrior of my choice to the test server arena.  Create a cleric of any class and any level with PoG BP the way it was.  Create a warrior of equal class, level and equiptement.  Allow me to have C2 since I would most likely have gotten it from someone in any zone we could duo anyway.  <P>Then pit both warriors up against seperate mobs of your choice with infinite hit points that should be able to distinguish the healing ability.  If I last an hour then you have to change the ablity back and apologize.  If my warrior dies in under an hour then I will apologize and your point will be made to all the EQ community.  Simple test.  It's time to put your money where your mouth is because way too many people don't believe you.<P>I am sorry if this sounded confrontational but it's the only way to prove anything to someone who refuses to listen.  Though this is a limited use, it seems to be the one you have been quoting most often and based your decision on. <P>Should you decide to ignore the possibility you could be wrong about this and just move on, let me at least give my opinion on the change.  Whatever it is should stick with the original theme of this BP as it was intended.  This includes the risk versus reward.  This intention was to reduce the downtime between fights.  <P>Buffs would have a very marginal ability to do this and only if you found a buff that everyone would use at lvl 60.  <P>Mana regen type effects/buffs are a viable option and probably the best for this purpose.  I would rather log than sit down and med to full with no clarity most of the time.  Or at least go do something else for 15 minutes (GEMS?). Possibilities include clarity type spell but less regen than C2, Manconversion with cast time similar to Manarobe, and Harvest with an extensive casting time (one minute might work here).<P>I am not sure what else you can come up with that would honestly reduce down time between fights but I am more that willing to accept this and move on if it accomplishes that task.<P>Thanks for listening despite the terse flavor.<P>Gairloch Daimonios<BR>Lvl 59 Cleric<BR>Eastern Keep<BR>Rodcet Nife Server<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My suggestion is similar to those previously posted.  Instead of changing the casting time, reduce the amount of healing to 200/click.  If that is not acceptable, than a cleric only harvest spell similar to the wizard spell would be a good idea.  Changing the casting time to 1 minute takes a useful item and turns it into armor.  I honestly hope you don't nerf it.<P>Karric Rhone, 54th Cleric of Tunare<BR>Scarlet Horizon<BR>Solusek Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The Caster Robe that drops off Trak has a mana regen similar to the hp/mana ratio of the mana stone.<P>The effect is called simply Mana Conversion.<P>This is the idea that seems most in line with what VI had intended the PoG BP to acomplish. It lessens down time.<P>It is already in the game.  <P>It is currently usable by wiz, necro, mage and chant0rz.<P>After much thought this seems the best replacement in my opinion.<P>Please do NOT replace the effect with BoF, or any other AC/symbol buff that wont stack with Aego.  <P>Please do NOT replace the effect with invisibility. We can buy the potions for 12 plat or get our warriors to invis us via their Cobalt anyway.  If you (VI) do decide to go this route, consider Improved Invisability.  Improved Invis, being almost worth the trouble to obtain the item. <P>Remember you are dealing with the BEST cleric gear in the game.  You are deciding what our current apex will be.<P>Please start taking the time to make the risk/time investment worth the reward WITHOUT the threat of NERF. <P>On a side note.  Are we done now?  I respectfully asked this several times when I went along peacefully with the Donal's nerf, but got no answer.<P>Are we done now?  Or are you guys scoping out anything else in the cleric class that you feel is overpowering and detrimental to the game? <P>I'm not asking for details, just a yes or no.<P>We have become a bit more than paranoid and we deserve to know. <P><BR> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>From today patch message<P>-- The casting time for four cleric brestplates sporting the "Celestial Healing" effect has been increased to one minute. We understand that this severely limits the use of that effect and we are currently discussing alternate effects to place on those items in the next patch. We did, however, need to address the 300pt per tick regen that could be placed and kept on the group tank. When we've decided on the new affect, it will be applied to those items retroactively. <P>Thank you for that last sentence.  Thank you for recognizing that you have destroyed the item and it needs to be replaced.  <P>Now, can you give us a time frame here?  How long is our best piece of gear going to be useless, before you implement the "fix"?  <P>A couple of days?  A week?  A few weeks?  <P> <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
