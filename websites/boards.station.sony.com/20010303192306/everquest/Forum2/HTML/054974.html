</FONT><HR>Hi all!  I thought I'd share my perceptions of the  Fan Faire.  Overall I had a really great time and had a lot of fun meeting new people, seeing new things, drinking new drinks, etc.<P>The Friday night registration and reception was very informal and a touch chaotic, but I get the feeling that's the way it was supposed to be.  It was the one big "get social" part of the event and we were encouaged to bum around.  I met a lot of people from my server (luclin) and it was wild to see the people behind the avatars.<P>Saturday we broke up by server and then again by teams to work on a real quest.  One team leader was appointed and he was the only one allowed to talk to the NPCs and get the puzzles.  The rest of the team stayed behind to work on the puzzles.  This turned out to be more fun than I expected and  a RL buddy of mine who had been dreading it wound up really getting into the game.  My favorite moment was when people crowded around one of the NPCs.  He was being pestered and backed into a corner.  Suddenly he says, "I despawn."  And we couldn't talk to him for awhile.  I'd LOVE to be able to do that at work....<P>The open forums were neat.  I was very disappointed by the behavior of people at the producer/developer's forum.  Hey guys, it's your big chance to ask about the Vision(tm), the general direction EQ is going in, their own personal wishlists, or anything else and what happens?  People whine about customer service issues.  I left and went to the Personalities forum.  That was a lot more relaxed.  While they couldn't answer any real questions, it gave us a chance to get the viewpoint of the people who run the game.  I can also safely state that Absor, Ester, and others are not trying to make your life miserable with patches and nerfs.  I shook Absor's hand after the forum was over.  Nice guy.<P>(FYI - They are really concerned with people spreading out more ... and melees are definatly going to get more bind spots!)<P>Then I played the EQ Jepordy game.  If you ever play it: it's fun, but don't wait more than 10 minutes in line for it.  I waited until the line was real short.  It covers a very broad knowledge of Norrath.  You'd have to read the Harpy's Head and know a lot of zones to do well.<P>The last "event" was the EQ Trivia.  We broke up by classes.  In order to do well here, I'd suggest making a character to level 5 of many race/class combinations and do a LOT of newbie quests.  The level 57 guy in our group was not a lot of help.  The level 40 guy who had active secondary and tertiary characters REALLY made a huge contribution.  (my friends in other groups reported the same findings)<P>Finally was dinner.  There were some give aways and the in-game prizes were awarded. I have yet to see the stats on the Sword of the Gathering and the Staff of the Gathering, but I am very eager.<P>I was also very fortunate in that I got to hang out with a very nice Head GM (not from my server, drat!) and chat awhile.  Some of the guys from Bertoxxulous and I took turns buying each other drinks.  <P>The next event will be in San Diego.  I strongly encourage people to go.  To the event staff I have two suggestions:<P>1) Have the Producer/Developers deliver a "Sate of EQ" speech.  Even if it's just a stupid rehash of producer letters.  It would have given the forum a little more focus.  <P>2) The EQ trivia part was a little too much time pressure.  I would have enjoyed the ability to take some time and "talk shop" with my class.  I know there are on-line forums that can do that just as well, but talking to someone in person is a very different experience than talking to them on-line.<P>Thanks for the great event folks!<P>Kered<BR>Druid of the 25th thingie<BR>Luclin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, Absor, as someone who was there at your "Personalities" forum (and in the front row, too, no less, with my "Mithaniel Marr" banner), let me apologize for not being more boisterous.<P>About the only thing anyone wanted to debate that was relevant to what you guys do, was about the "Best of the Best" or "Test of Tactics" competitions, and since my highest-level character is only 43, those issues aren't going to affect me any time soon.  So I doin't get heated about them.  And when just about any other issue came up, Ester said (correctly), that it was a development issue, so you guys couldn't help much.<P>I guess you could have heatedly debated my request to do more to inform players about the "LFG" tag... but you seemed to agree with me, so who's fault is it, really, that we didn't get heated?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>That was a forum i was unable to get to, I was hitting as many as i could and suddenly they were over. But heard some good things at the others. <P>Overall I would say it was all good. But you might want to refine the live quest and trivia quest a bit, the quests themselves were good but the running of them was a bit caotic at the end.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>What you saw at the producer/developer forum was evidence of what I call the IP Curtain Cowards. People are brave in these kind of messages but get them face to face and they become sheep again.<P>Please do not get me wrong, I prefer civil discussion.<P>Glad to hear you had a good time. I am hoping they have one of those closer to where I live, Minneapolis, MN.
