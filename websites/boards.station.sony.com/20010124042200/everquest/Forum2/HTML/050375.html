&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Hi all,<P>Most of you probably know that we're working on a second generation MMORPG set in the Star Wars universe - if you didn't know that, or would like more info, please check out http://www.station.sony.com/starwars/.<P>Anyway, Raph Koster, SW:G's Creative Director, has made some posts that I thought warranted posting on Verant's other message boards because they're applicable to MMOGs in general.  The first two have to do with why MMORGs have both a retail cost and subscription fee.  In the future, don't be surprised to see me cross-post more articles, because, well, Raph knows his stuff  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>-Brad McQuaid<BR>Executive Producer, EQ & Planetside<BR>VP, Premium Games<BR>Verant Interactive/Sony Online Entertainment<P>-------------<P>On "pay to play" or, MMORPG Business Models 101<P>I keep seeing this question recur.  Here we go, guys, more than you ever wanted to know about what costs what, and why you have to pay a subscription fee for massively multiplayer online games...<P>Once upon a time there were MUDs (massively multiplayer text-based online RPGs), and they were free. And it was good. They ran on university computers like PDP-11s and early Unix workstations. They usually ran out of student, grad student, or even professor's accounts, and sometimes they were sponsored by the university's comp sci department or some such. The people who ran them did so out of the goodness of their hearts, and often put in many, many hours a week. In the geek world of those days, that was good--it even looked good to other geeks when you put it on your resume. Why isn't the world still this way? Ah, the good old days... <P>Fast forward -- MUDs now often run on mudhosting services, where they pay a site provider for disk space and bandwidth. Many MUDs are abandoning the original licenses the software originally had, because the licenses precluded making a profit in any way. MUDs selling t-shirts, doing fund drives, and even charging has become common. Over in another part of the Internet, some siblings of MUDs have become commercial.  Running on online services most of you don't remember once existed, with names like The Source and GEnie and QuantumLink, these other games charged users. By the hour. Like, over $10 an hour. Seriously. Per-minute charges, in some cases.<P>Then you get to the present day. What happened? Well, some execs decided to launch a major massively multiplayer game at a flat monthly fee. And now everyone does the same.<P>How did all of this happen? The answer is simple. The basic building blocks of the Internet, which used to be fairly freely passed around a small community of hardcore computer scientists, have become commodified. These days you'd be hard pressed to find a university that would sponsor a mud and let it run on its Unix machines with unlimited processor, hard drive, and bandwidth usage. Heck, bandwidth is scarce enough that some time ago, Australia BANNED MUDs. From the entire continent. I kid you not.<P>Here's what the big costs are in running an MMORPG:<P>- development. This is, literally, millions of dollars. Figure a largish team (larger than is common for a standalone game) for longer than a standard standalone game development cycle. On top of that, some of the people on the team that you have to assemble are rare in the games industry--DBAs and fault-tolerant network designers and mission critical system administrators. (Us designers usually come a bit cheaper.  )<P>- deploying the servers. This can also be millions of dollars, believe it or not. For one thing, the boxes needed tend to be pricier than the kind you probably have at home, because you want lots of redundancy, the ability to hot-swap parts out, all that jazz. You're writing to disk constantly, you need a hefty RAID array, tape backups, etc.<P>Those are your initial investment. Oh--forgot, there's the standard costs involved with getting a game into your hands in the first place  (packaging, the monies charged by distributors, the monies charged by stores to put your product on a shelf--did you know they charge publishers for that?)... but we can skip all that for now, since it isn't applicable to the monthly fee.<P>Now, if you are successful, you can make back your initial investment off of box sales and off of the first few months of monthly fees. Notice that already the monthly fee starts to matter. <P>Now we get into the meat of the matter--ongoing costs.<P>Assuming you live in the US, you are likely paying someone around $20 for the privilege of tying up some wires or phone lines and using up some bandwidth. In normal usage, you're not using it all that much--odds are that even if you have a cable modem or ISDN, that you're not doing bandwidth-intensive stuff all the time. In fact, if you DO have cable, I suggest you go check right now and see that your user agreement probably PROHIBITS you from doing bandwidth intensive things all the time. In my area, my cable provider says "you can't run a dedicated FPS server on your cable modem," for example.<P>That's what you get for 20 bucks.<P>Playing an MMO is probably one of the most bandwidth intensive things you do on a regular basis. It's like downloading a large file, the entire time that you are playing. The key here is that the bandwidth is *sustained* bandwidth, not "bursty" the way that most things you do on the Net are, like web browsing. ISPs don't like sustained bandwidth, because it means they can support fewer people. They rely on the burstiness to squeeze more people onto the limited capacity of the wires.<P>Why does this matter to us? Well, simple logic. Let's say that you at your end are using 1k of bandwidth every second while playing our game. That means that we at our end are also using 1k a second receiving what you are doing and sending back what you see. But for you, that's $20 and you're worried about one guy. For us, it's a lot less than $20 a head, but we have to pay for the bandwidth usage of EVERYONE playing the game.<P>That right there wipes out a significant fraction of your monthly fee.<P>Then there's hardware issues. You have to pay someone--actually, many someone's--(and these guys don't come cheap) to make sure that the network stays running. Do backups, monitor things, fix whatever goes wrong. These poor guys wear pagers and are on call 24/7. Plus, depending on your setup, these boxes may not be at your office. They may be at co-location facilities. And that means you're paying monthly fees for rack space and for guys THERE who sit at that facility and make sure all the blinky lights stay on.<P>That's only a small drop in the bucket of the people costs though. There's an expectation of customer service too. I'll be up front and say that as an industry, we're still figuring that part out. But we already know that it's really, really expensive! After all, you can't just go hire a bunch of kids fresh from flipping burgers, train 'em in the game and the customer service tools, and pay them minimum wage. They'll be lousy customer service reps. REAL customer service people have a multitude of skills, and cost a lot more than minimum wage. You can train people to be real customer service people, of course, but then you have to pay them real money, too.  So support eats up another huge portion of the monthly fee...<P>What else? Ongoing development. There's a development team that stays on the game after it finishes. They fix bugs that crop up, and they also add new content. This is an ongoing thing, and it can be quite a large amount of people--not as many as it took to make the game in the first place, but a significant fraction.<P> [[By the way, just to address the issue--some companies have promised to never charge for an add-on or expansion. We are not making that promise, and I'll tell you why. Making large content additions can require extra team members, which incurs extra cost, of course. But also, having a new box on the shelf means that new people join the game. It's very hard to keep a year-old game on the shelf in this industry (in fact, it only happens for fairly rare hits) but it's an absolute necessity for an online game, whose lifespan is measured in multiple years. It's hard to afford ongoing marketing out of the monthly fee, and it's almost impossible to get press (which drives awareness for drawing in new people) or media attention without a new box. So you make a new box because it comes with these things--which cost money, of course, but then the new box sales help pay for it.]]<P>There are other miscellaneous costs going in there. Consider the fact that if you call a support guy in-game ONCE and keep him tied up for an hour, you just burned up ALL the monthly profit we make off of your subscription fee. Actually, you probably burned up quite a bit more than that. We have a direct incentive to reduce the amount of bugs and make the game as easy and trouble-free as possible, because the more you need to call, the more it costs us, and the less money we make...<P>When all is said and done, if there's no ongoing costs, there's no massively multiplayer game. If you decided not to have a monthly fee, you would lose money before you even launched the game, and never make it back.<P>Yes, there are online games that have tried other revenue streams. Some matchmaker services have used ad revenue to support the cost. Of course, being matchmakers means that they don't actually run the game--they just pair you and your opponents up, so they don't have servers, customer support people, or bandwidth cost (except for the lobby). But notice that even most of the matchmaker services are gone now...<P>When all is said and done, the subscription fee is a necessity for this type of game. However, it didn't have to be a flat monthly fee. It could have been hourly, the way that it was for a decade and a half of online gaming. But fortunately, that all changed a few years back. It used to be that online gamers regularly paid hundreds of dollars a month to play their favorite MMOGs.<P>Personally, I think we're lucky to pay what we do these days. <P>I don't know when we'll announce the subscription fee for SWG (probably not for a very long time) but I'm sure it'll be reasonable. Look at it this way--last movie I went to see in the theater, with the popcorn & soft drink, cost me lots more than the typical monthly fee. And it only lasted two hours. And it sucked. <P>-Raph Koster<BR>Creative Director, Star Wars: Galaxies<BR>Verant Interactive/Sony Online Entertainment<P>--------------<P>There's less than 30 [computer] games that have EVER sold a million copies. You'd recognize every single name (and a substantial amount of the list is from our friends at Blizzard  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> A game that sells a half million is a huge hit. In fact, a game that sells lifetime 250,000 is doing really, really well. The vast majority of games released do not break 50,000 units, and the vast majority of games released do not make back the money it cost to make them. To my knowledge, only two MMOGs have ever sold over 300,000 [ed. note: EQ as of 1/18/01 has sold-thru 503,357 units].<P>A $40 box on the shelf has so many hidden costs it's not funny. Between the distributor's cut, the shelf stocking fees, the cost of goods, etc, that box likely only makes the publisher $15-20. And if the publisher isn't also the developer, then the developer gets even less than that. To get on the shelves at the end of the aisles at a Best Buy or similar store costs tens of thousands of dollars each MONTH, which comes out of the publisher's pocket.<P>In practice, many companies view the risks of doing an MMOG, which has a much higher upfront cost, plus huge ongoing costs, to be too risky. This despite the fact that making money off of standalone games is a massive roll of the dice (one estimate had over 7,000 games published last year, with only around the first 700 actually making any profit). MMOGs with subscription fees provide sustained revenue month after month, but at a much LOWER profit margin than what you'd get for a hit title that sold the same number of units. Companies that have proven expertise in landing titles in the top ten may very well view creating a top ten title as a lower risk (financially speaking) than making an MMOG despite the "guaranteed" income an MMOG provides. I once did a detailed breakdown on why that is in a newsgroup post in comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.rpg, which you can probably find with a search on Deja.com.<P>Now, I'm not saying that we're not in this to make money. Of course we are. But we're also in it for love of the genre--we do this because MMOG is our passion. Because lemme tell ya, it's a lot easier in many ways to go do something else. <P>-Raph Koster<BR>Creative Director, Star Wars: Galaxies<BR>Verant Interactive/Sony Online Entertainment<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hey Brad!  Just got back from Steamboat and reading the boards... <P>I think a $10 a month fee is very reasonable.<P>I can see you raising that price with inflation so that it would go up about a $1 every 12 to 18 months (so in 10 years, it would be about $18 per month but we will all be making 80% more so it will be the "same" inflation adjusted price).<P>---<P>I FIRMLY believe, if you had a server where poeple were limited to 100 or 200 hours per month, people would play on this server and it would help both your players and your company.<P>One- they would be prevented from playing "too much" and destroying their lives.  But...<P>Two- they would be on an even footing with all other players who could only play that many hours so it would be "fair"<P>Three- they would have the option to play on "unlimited" servers (but wouldn't)<P>Four- you would suddenly have the same dollars being payed by players who were only consuming 100 to 200 hours instead of the 240-300 hours consumed now.<P><BR>Cheers<P>P.S.<BR>I think you should limit the number of levels people can lose.  Very player friendly (once you reach 50, you can only lose down to 46 as an example) and it fixes a major irritation on red servers (a L50 "deleveling" down to L20 so they can instantly kill "true" L20's and loot before they can "bag" good items).<P>P.P.S.<BR>Love the changes to the game lately- hope that you don't go overboard and get "monty haul"ish.<BR>The changes so far are and WERE needed but please don't over do it!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Very interesting, but moot I think. I doubt anyone can argue that $10 a month is outragous. It is the follow-up most seem to have an issue with. All I ask for is GM's that are UP TO DATE on bugs and broken quests. They don't need to be experts but they should at least be aware that something is wrong with a particular area or NPC. I would also like them to be player-oriented, not getting scammed all the time, but the default should NOT be that all customers are liars and cheats.<P>As well, as customers we are prevented from presenting solid "evidence" of something going wrong. Not because we don't want to, but because you won't allow it. A bit of built-in frustration there since all we here from VI is "it's editable by YOU (the paying customer) so it must be a lie". 10 lines per session is not adequite.<P>And if a GM makes an appointment, then there should be a penalty for missing it. Is that unfair? How fair is it for a customer to go to a lot of trouble to get (for instance) 10 people from up to 10 different timezones in one place and then having the CS rep not even bother to show up?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;That's only a small drop in the bucket of the people costs though. There's an expectation of customer service too. I'll be up front and say that as an industry, we're still figuring that part out. But we already know that it's really, really expensive! After all, you can't just go hire a bunch of kids fresh from flipping burgers, train 'em in the game and the customer service tools, and pay them minimum wage. They'll be lousy customer service reps. REAL customer service people have a multitude of skills, and cost a lot more than minimum wage. You can train people to be real customer service people, of course, but then you have to pay them real money, too. So support eats up another huge portion of the monthly fee...<BR>&lt;&lt;<P>Well you had a great idea with the Guide Program. You COULD have gotten people whom have EXCELLENT Customer Service skills and love the game.<BR>But you tied thier hands behind thier backs and shackled them in place by NOT LETTING THEM HELP.<P>What's the point to having guides if they aren't allowed to do the job the guide program was created for?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well thanks for sharing all of the nitty gritty on MMORGP's.  Interesting reading, but frankly as a consumer I don't really care.<P>You guys have made a great game, you are obviously making profits or it wouldn't be continuing, and the monthly subscription fee is reasonable enough to keep people such as myself playing.<P>I think that EQ will see people leave in droves as the next generation of games come out.  There will be some lemons, but some will leave EQ far behind.  I only hope that they get the customer service thing down - doesn't exist at Verant.<P>SW may be the next big thing, who knows?  I feel that many people will be hesitant to resubscribe to a company with a proven track record of ignoring customer concerns when there will be a lot of other players in the marketplace competing for the same dollars.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>gestaltmind, inflation adjustment?<P>Now is the time technology is becoming more powerful and affordable than ever.  Moores law regarding doubling processor speeds every 6 months will be blown away like lint with the new 64bit cpus. In less than 2 years, it may very well be that the average desktop has more horsepower than EQs entire network. 80GB Sprint Dark Fiber backbones should provide cheap economical bandwidth or you could try MCI or a new statelite provider. Pricing should go down.<P>The big problem with these games is labor and the fact that technology changes so fast they go out of date without an ongoing development team. Free upgrades should be built into the fee.<P>BTW How does one go about landing one of those pricy network failover sys admin, DBA, or programming jobs?  If you move to FL you can get those types for less than 26k per year and there's Disney world and no income tax.. hehe  =D   Its just really crowded and people don't know how to drive or speak any english but other than that FL is great!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

And Warriors don't get critical hits or crippling hits.<P>Now, I would say that in that context, the hybrids do have some major advantages over warriors.  In other words, the xp penalty seems justified at the time EQ was released.<P>Of course, a lot have changed over time.

</FONT><HR><BR>Yep andy D, however there is one thing that verant and other people may not be thinking about.<P>This time you have someone else to complain to about poor CS, Lucasarts.<P>If lucasarts is getting 300,000 emails from people saying "in YOUR star wars mmorpg..." something might get done.<P>Like you though I'll always have a stigma about verant because of eq. Having problems due to bugs which are never fixed.. like falling for like a foot for 10,000 damage while having great trouble getting a gm is just inexcuseable. If you are going to have things happen like that in a game, there should be no xp penalty for dying. Dying was the penalty.<P>No xp penalty for dying would solve about 99.9 percent of eq customers problems that they have trouble getting customer service for, or believed for once they do. I guess verant is smart to be making planetside. Its more of a persistent Quake/half life type game where dying is just getting fragged then you get a basic kit and jump right in again. See, when people in planetside fall for 10,000 damage due to some bug and die.. they'll jump right back in again and maybe /bug it or something but not totally freak out.<P>I think people expect to pay 10 bucks a month or so for most games like this. 370,000 plus people paying 10 bucks a month probably equals having better CS. What is it.. 370,000 per month yet only like 60,000 on at any one time during peak? I forget. <P>"But for you, that's $20 and you're worried about one guy. For us, it's a lot less than $20 a head, but we have to pay for the bandwidth usage of EVERYONE playing the game.<P>That right there wipes out a significant fraction of your monthly fee"<P>Yeah but as I said though at peak its only what 60,000 of 370,000 at ANY ONE TIME using it. This means the more subscribers, who are not all on at the same time of coure, the more gravy.<P>"There are other miscellaneous costs going in there. Consider the fact that if you call a support guy in-game ONCE and keep him tied up for an hour, you just burned up ALL the monthly profit we make off of your subscription fee. Actually, you probably burned up quite a bit more than that. We have a direct incentive to reduce the amount of bugs and make the game as easy and trouble-free as possible, because the more you need to call, the more it costs us, and the less money we make..."<P>Oh oh.. i think raph just said a bit too much ; )<BR>Here again though, you don't have 370,000 people tying that guy up for an hour. So once again, due to the sheer number, you have gravy. In fact I bet the tie up ends up being quite small. <P>For that reason, I don't think an mmorpg fee should ever be more than 10 dollars. Star wars online, unless it is simply totally horrible, is going to at least equal EQ's subscription numbers quite soon just because it is Star Wars. More than 10 bucks would be like shooting yourself in the foot. Online people are basically frugal, they could see dumping some money at the bar or on a movie but want online services at a standard low price.<P>Something else that I would hazzard is that once you have the set up for an mmorpg like everquest, that subsequent verant-run mmorpgs like planetside and star wars online get cheaper. I mean there is going to be some overlap of costs especially if they are all on the same site. You got a big giant fat internet pipe, backup servers, etc for EQ  but can basically use the same thing for another MMORPG because you (based upon EQ) still don't have more than 60,000 people on during peak.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Of those that do, many have positive experiences. The ones you see on these boards are the posts by people who have had negative experiences. So I would guess that there are maybe thousands, but not tens of thousands of potential complaints.

</FONT><HR>I have to second the big "wah". Why are they feeding us this?<P>Think about this for as long as your attention span allows.<P>EQ (according to McQuaid) has sold 500,000+ copies. Let's just be generous and assume he means 500,000 boxes of "EQ Game" product as he was so careful not to enumerate what of that was EQ, what was Kunark (EQ+stuff) and Velious (stuff, but you had to have or buy EQ or RoK to run it). They like to tout big general numbers. Notice they haven't said much about subscriptions or "high retention rates" lately?<P>EQ was at first appealing to a market of gamers, the kind that temporarily abandoned their pencils and papers and Trammel to play. Then it spread, and they worked like mad to keep it running and eventually started turning it into what we are seeing today, a lever-and-pellet game targeted at their Lowest Common Denominator audience. <P><BR>Granted, at least some bits of it are finally working...remarkable considering how long they've had us testing and telling them things were broken... I don't think I've seen any company still in business who takes things at the remarkably insane pace they do. Six months for Alchemy, twenty-four plus for others... If I hadn't seen it for myself, I would'nt have believed it. Sure, I can understand they might have been understaffed R & Ding other things, but it would have been nice if they'd gotten around to finishing the game before they released it, instead of ripping out core "Vision" now.<P>They dropped the whole "role playing" facade... They realised people wanted things like "The Sims" and Ultima, so the did everything Ultima did... added trade skills, added things so people could be "unique" with the trade skills, could build their character...<P>And now they want to attract those who don't want to put as much of an investment in the game, a shiny object to keep some disgruntled people, intrigue the ones who had left and were probably thinking about cancelling (more on the "300,000" later) and get another generation of players interested in a game that wasn't doing as well as they thought it should, especially with delays on other games rearing their heads (speculation from rumors about VI).<P>What did they do to acheive this? They did what UO did... they made it easier for folks to "gain levels"... they tossed one of the core items of their oh-so-precious "Vision" right down the incinerator chute. They changed the client interface that they spent eighteen months telling us they couldn't change.<P>Wah, so it costs money. People know that, and those who don't want to know that don't care. Perception is everything. <P>What do people see for their ten or twenty dollars a month? Lousy customer service policies, customer service people who either don't give a flying leap or who would like to try their damndest but are completely hogtied by red tape and clueless management.<P>Now think about SW:G. They aren't going to get a small group of gamer geeks in on it. They are going to get any living breathing StarWars Fan clamoring to get in. They will be camping the stores for days or weeks ahead of time.<P>And their customer service group will be crushed under the weight. Unless a few heads roll from the upper echelons of VI's "core team"... they're going to have a lot of problems...much bigger than a ding in their precious little sports cars. <P>Despite what his rep among the casually clueless gamers may be, Raph Koster isn't god. And frankly, if VI Austin hadn't wrested control over SW:G away from VI San Diego, I expect he would have been gone as quickly as Hook. But the important question is, is VI Austin going to break away completely and not depend on the vagiaries of VI San Diego for customer support? THe same customer support that outsources their credit card processing and can't even get that right by quite a few accounts on this board.<P>What I want to know from Raph, is will he let this thing fail by cutting corners on one of it's core needs..the lifesupport lifeblood of customer service?<P>Code can be tested and hotfixed. THere is no quick fix or patch for good service. Is Raph going to give the Rabid Starwars Fans what they need?<P>Customers are demanding. They don't want to know why...they want to know why you have failed, why it doesn't work, why you locked yourselves out of the building when the power went out. Why when they have a problem you aren't helping them. Why you put bugs on the live servers that were reported on the Test server. Why you bother having a Test sever when you don't listen to the players there. <P>At least Brad's gotten to the point where he isn't flaming and screaming anymore and they "relocated" Gordon as well...someone must have clued them in but lack of abuse isn't enough to solve problems long term.<P>300000/500000 != High renetion rate. The joke heard around Lum's (!invocation of Lum=post written off as brainless and cluess) is that you don't hear the magic number of 300,000 because when that was made public, 50,000 to 150,000 people realised they forgot to cancel their subcription. <P>Or did they finally look at their own information (http://www.instantweb.com/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=data%20mining) and realise that they had actually lost a boat load of customers because they had many many many customers with multiple accounts, accounts picked up when their original owners abandoned them?<P>So I wonder what the motivation behind this post is? More softening up after the 'customer service survey' they did? More softening up after dumping the 'experience penalty'? Gearing up to raise the price? For better service? But weren't they going to do that when Diablo II came out? <P>And how is a phone than hangs up on you when it is too busy improved customer service? It doesn't matter if they went from one phone line in Utah to 24 in San Diego if no one picks it up. How much is 'our new, happy life' going to cost? And will it be better?<P>They want 'irrepressible spontaneous demonstrations' when they make announcements. And they do get it... but when will the speeches stop and the changes start?<P>How much is this going to cost us? Sounds like my old boss, used to tell us how much we had cost him in health insurance and how much in taxes he had to pay for us to justify not giving us a cost of living scale increase.<P>*BJ*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Learn from Eq's mistakes.<P>Unfortunately it seems Star Wars online is going to go in the same direction as EverQuest.

</FONT><HR>Ah, A_Beta_Jester_00, always so tough on us you are  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Anyway, about the numbers -- we've always been up front with everyone on this stuff -- nothing to hide.<P>503,357 individual accounts have been registered as of 1/18/01.  An existing subscriber who upgrades to Kunark and/or Velious does NOT create a new registration, so this number doesn't indicate total EverQuest related units sold -- the number would even be higher.<P>As of the same date we had 331,109 active subscribers.  That's a 65+% churn rate over 21 months.  FYI, that's phenomenal and unprecedented.  EQ is still growing like crazy with far more people subscribing than leaving.  We've never seen it plateau, and it's always been appealing to RPG players, and frankly you insult yourself and a lot of people who play EQ by implying they're 'Lowest Common Denominator'.<P>And we've certainly never stopped calling the game an RPG -- EQ is a game that continues to appeal to all sorts of players, hard core and casual, RPers and power gamers, and everybody else inbetween.<P>And of course we continue to make changes to the game in an attempt to keep it current, interesting, and better.  And while the recent changes are some of the most major, probably since we halved experience loss due to death a few months after release, I wouldn't extrapolate too much on the reasons and possible 'conspiracies' behind them.  Abashi explained it succinctly in a recent interview:  we have an opportunity between major expansions to re-evaluate the game as a whole and make some global changes before heading into future major content additions.  <P>As for SW:G, yes, the game will be huge, and we will be there, ready with the customer support necessary to handle such a crowd.  And the game itself?  It couldn't be in better hands -- their team is very experienced, being made up of people from UO, EQ, M59, and elsewhere.  When Rich and Raph approached me and joined Verant, Smed and I couldn't think of anyone better to lead such a massive project -- I was more than happy to give it to them, and frankly, they're doing an incredible job  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Ah well, probably not much I can say to make you happier, but then you are still here, reading these boards and posting.  Hopefully EQ will evolve into something more to your liking, or perhaps you'll enjoy one of our future games even moreso.  Until then, rant on  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>-Aradune<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Glower & Jyn,<P>Point taken.<P>However, this does mean that you are just asserting something same as R. is.  A link to a listing of Australian muds would be a good counterproof to R.'s statement.<P>I've always thought it was silly of EQ to provide numbers of subscribers.  So much about the business can be derived from those hard numbers.<P>However, I think Aradune has once again calmly countradicted the extreme fringe.  And though I would agree that Abashi has lost it in the past, I have never seen a single post from Brad/Aradune where he "screamed" or engaged in any kind of extreme behavior and I've been reading his posts here, on Usenet, on EQ.Stratics since May of 1999.<P>For the person who said that hardware is getting cheaper- yes I agree BUT bandwidth requirements are not getting cheaper right now.  They are pretty stable (tho a lot more fiber is being laid as we type).   Verant uses more bandwidth than the two largest providers can manage as it is.  That costs a lot of money.  Employee salaries increase with inflation every year.<P>IMHO, EQ is a great bargain.  The ONLY thing that has ever driven me bonkers is major negative changes to classes months (or years) after people have played that class.  It never seemed fair to change a class in a fundamental negative way after a person has put hundreds of hours into it.  It seemed to happen most often after Vox or Naggy was killed in some new inventive way.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The contents page description of this otherwise excellent article commented that MUDs "are so popular that educators are alarmed. Australia has even banned them." I was surprised and embarrassed to find this statement in Wired. Surprised, because as an Australian who has spent two years making a cultural study of MUD use, I know perfectly well that they are not banned in my country. Embarrassed, because I have the awful feeling that I may have been at least partially responsible for starting this rumour. <P>And a persistent rumour it is. Perhaps I am oversensitised to the topic, but it seems that hardly a week goes by without my finding it being repeated. I find shreds of this rumour on mailing lists, questions about it Usenet newsgroups, and on the 16th of July I even found it repeated in the Melbourne newspaper The Age!
