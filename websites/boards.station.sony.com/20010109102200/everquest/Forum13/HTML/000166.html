</FONT><HR>Hey all you warriors out there, tell me if this sounds familiar.<P>I have been denied membership to groups for the following reasons, proving that warriors need some ability increases.<P>I hate it when I am grouped with a mage or necro, who, at the same level as me, summons a pet that i s almost always a blue con.  However, when engaged in combat, I find that the BLUE pet is OUTDAMAGING me, not by a little, but A LOT!!!  I am a 40 ogre warrior with 2 yaks, so its not an issue of equipment.  The pet only has summoned swords.  Not only is it outdamaging me with melee, but at also casting spells for damage!  Then after the combat is over, the pet heals FASTER than I do, and most of the time does not require a heal to be at full health by the time the Mage/Necro is at full mana.<BR>While I realize that the strength of the mage/necro pets are necessary to their ability to solo, I don't see why my entire arsenal of combat (offense/ defense) should be WEAKER than a simple PET of LOWER level!!  After all...its just a pet, not a whole player class.  I once saw a level 49 pet beat a SUPER equiped level 55 warrior.<P>Verant--- I am not saying to make mage/necro pets weaker, but give us (warriors) at least the power of a pet (HP regen, higher melee abilities) so that mages and necros dont just say, "naa...we dont need you in the group..we have our pets, and they dont require the use of mana to heal.  You will just take experience away from us and increase our downtime."<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Why is the Pet outdamaging us ? simple : they are consider to be MOB !!! Attack a monster outside of the same lvl and he will beat you in no time .. especially when the lvl are getting higher.<P>This is why they :<BR>* outdamage you<BR>* have magical abilities<BR>* have more hp<BR>* have more skill<BR>* regen much much more faster<P>Take in account that if warrior (and other melee) where capable at hight level to be more powerfull than a pet (by rising our skill not getting by weakening the pet) you would see TONS of post because Hybrid would want the same.<P>I can understand they have some problems but i already read too much about them lately and i find that pretty much enought.<P>That was my 2 cp.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Guys, I don't want to sound "elitist" or snobbish, but things will get better.  To be honest, at 50, I don't know if mage/necro pets will outdamage me right now or not.  I do know this: in high intensity zones (yeah you kewl doodz will call them phat lewt zones), people don't want pets, because they are a) difficult to control and hence may wander and bring a train  b) they may aggro mobs through walls etc easier and bring a train.<P>I know what you're feeling: I've been there (it still kinda irks me that I can not take an even con EVER and only the occasional blue solo, at this level), but it will get better if you've the patience to see it through.  If not, make a necro or mage and take "advantage" of this disparity.<P>Wulfran Moondancer <BR>Warrior of the Tribunal for 50 seasons<BR>Keepers of the Elements<BR>Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It IS irritating, but I don't think Verant will ever find a solution to the problem.  Pet classes would never tolerate a decrease in pet power, hybrids would never tolerate an increase in melee power.<P>But I know full well what you mean.  I'm melee also, a level 26 rogue, and blue pets are disguistingly more powerful than me.  Surely something has to be done to balance this, but for the life of me I can't imagine what.<P>It bothers me when I see groups advertising for "a tank or a caster with a pet", but I guess that's just the way it is.<P>V<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Melee across the board needto do more damage, as do wizards via spells. I am a 54 warrior and my friends necro pet, "the monk pet," can outdamage me very easily. I am wielding the following weapons: Crystalline Short Sword/Lamentation Blade for 1h, Throne Blade of the Ykesha for 2hs, and Sarnak battle Hammer for 2hb.<P>The only solutions I can see for balancing players versus pets is this.. make the players more powerfull. NO MORE NERFING ANYTHING! <P>In my estimates, a player with proper items for his/her level should be able to melee as well as a buffed, dual wielding pet. Casters have spells to augment their pets damage output, so at the very least melee should be equal, and in my opinion, better than a casters pet. The only case where I see a pet should be equal to or better than a PC is: A) Poor Equipment B) Higher level than PC. <P>Just my 2 cents. <BR>Lumpy Poo<BR>54 Ogre Warrior - Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have never been denied joining a group because of a pet.  In most cases my addition to the group is seen as reason to get rid of the pet, and is warmly welcomed for that alone.  If you as a warrior are denied a place in a group because the pet is "better", consider yourself lucky.  No one in that group has their head on straight or they just don't understand how to do what is needed to be successful.  <P>Advantages that pets have are to help &gt;reduce&lt; their limitations.  <P>Pets do not pull<BR>Pets do not switch targets<BR>Pets require that someone spend time looking after them<BR>Pets mess up crowd control<BR>Pets cause trains<BR>Pets don't warn of adds to the fight<BR>Pets don't chat while you wait for the next MOB<P>To anyone that would deny this warrior a place in your group because of a pet, thanks in advance, you saved me a huge waste of time grouping with a huge waste of space.<P>Belce<BR>45 th Warrior<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

At the time there was a raid in Hate going, a raid against Trak the undead dragon, and the other 2 dragons at the same time.  I found more enchanters by a margin of 2 to 1 than warriors.

</FONT><HR>As a 50 mage / 40 Warrior / 23 SK / 7 rogue (G)<P>Pets are:<BR>Dumb: They attack what they are told to, or what hits them. They are NOT as hard to control as people make them out to be. /pet back off clears their hate list, but they do occasionally break mezzes because the mage/necro/sha wasn't fast enough to back it off.<P>To make up for being dumb, they do damage and have decent hitpoints. (at 49 my best pet is 41 or 42, and hits for 56, real npc's would be hitting 70's or 80's &lt;G&gt; so pets are WEAK npc's to begin with. WASN'T always this way! Pets use to be /much/ more powerful)<P><BR>As for them casting, with the exception of the earth pets root, I'd rather they didn't... I think at best the water pets DD is 80 or 90 pts and the fire is 100 or so... Which considering they hit for 50's is 90% of the time worse damage than if they would just continue swinging. <P>There are problems with being a pet class though. Prejudice. People have had, or have heard of, pets killing whole groups because of pathing, bugs, etc.. so you end up being told to loose your pet, which bsically means time to leave that group because mage - pet = (wizard/2). Plus you can't easily travel with a pet up all the time, and without a pet even a low green can kill a mage. Trust me... at 50 I've had 25th level giants kill me because I didn't have a pet up runnin through FM... <P>You meele's don't have it nearly as bad as you think..

</FONT><HR>Bah, I play on a PvP server and caster with pet owns a Warrior everyday.  The only time the warrior has a chance is if he is lucky enough to have old school pumice on him.  <P>If Mages and Necros could control their pets better, Warriors would be put out to pasture.  And don't tell me it gets better when you get past 50, there is a LONG stretch of time between 30 and 50 where being a Warrior really blows.  Especially 35 to 45,if you can't find a group then no exp for you!  Fortunatly, I have never been denied a spot in a group for not being a Pet Class - I have been denied for not being a healer a couple times, but that is more understandable.<P>What really gets me is to be an effective Warrior you have to have the best gear.  And the gear you should have at your level is never enough to get the job done.  I could be maxed out in all my combat skills and unless my weapon is prime gear I will not be very effective in combat.
