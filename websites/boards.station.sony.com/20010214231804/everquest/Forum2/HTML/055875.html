</FONT><HR>We apologize for the previous Paladin thread going corrupt, Alan was still able to read a great deal of your input before it disappeared... so we will try to continue the discussion here, sorry for the inconvenience... ~Akriss <P><BR>You can read the previous discussion here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055491.html<P><BR>By now you may already have seen some of the things that we plan to do with the paladin class in the hopes of adjusting their balance. Those changes came about, mostly, from our folks reading the threads about the other hybrids and reading those about paladins that were started in preparation for this thread. Feel free to discuss those changes as well, though I think they are all very much in line with what is needed for the paladin.<P>Here's a list that I stole from Everlore… I was too lazy to actually look them up (but this list seems accurate):<P>a) Add Endure Magic spell at level 30<BR>b) Add Resist Magic at 55<BR>c) Move Guard spell from 49 to 39<BR>d) Move Armor of Faith from 53 to 49<BR>e) New level 53 paladin spell, Divine Glory, clone of divine strength but 100 hp instead of 200<BR>f) New level 59 spell, Celestial Cleansing 110 hp healdot per tick, for 4 ticks. 1.5 second casting time. Recast time 30 secs.<BR>g) Defense skill cap made exactly same as warriors<P>So let's start the discussion. Please be detailed when explaining things. But at the same time, please be precise. I really don't need your background as a player, or detailed examples of gameplay (unless they are needed to explain a game mechanic). These threads get long, and anything that you folks can do to cut down the amount of text or increase the readability of the posts is appreciated.<P>And remember, we're primarily discussing 'balance' here. Bugs and such are fine to point out, but they are not the main reason we are here.<P>So let's hear what you have to say.<P>Alan<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I didn't read all of the last thread so I'm not sure if this has been brought up yet or not but I'll make this short...<P>Alan, you say that you don't think LoH should be a complete heal.  Why is this?  You know that it was a complete heal to start with and the reason givin that it was taken away was because it was exploited by having low level pallys CHing high level players.  So what is wrong with the idea of making LoH a CH after level 50?  Why do you feel that the original 'vision' of LoH is bad?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just in case the other thread vanishes again (hey you never know lol). I repost my thought on a paladin discipline, i watched my english a lot for this one, i don't want it to disapear with a bug  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>Numbers are totally fake, i just took it to make an exemple what i'm using is of course totally unbalanced i think. Also the discipline fits right in paladin role of hero sacrificing his life for others as many seem to want, help getting this working :<P><BR>I really like the idea of paladin protecting another person. <BR>While i would like a copy of defensive, this new discipline in place of holyforge (you really need to put crit/crip on undead always running...) would greatly help Paladins on large raids or even normal groups, and is unique to us.<P>Let's base it on defensive. It works during 3 minutes and can recharge every 10 minutes at 60 and during the period of 3 minutes, the paladin will take on him half the damage of his target.<P>Ok, in a normal group situation where stun root and taunt failed to get the attention of the monster, you will now have the possibility to cut by half the damage your groupmate is getting beaten for, giving a healer time to heal the poor soul.<P>On a large raid, i can already say the discpline will primarly be used with the warriors. <P>At the same moment the warrior enters in defensive mode, the paladin enters protecting mode, that means during 3 minutes, the paladin will receive on him half the melee damage the warrior is suffering (if the mob turns on you, well you get hit for full, bad luck)<P>In fact (and purely speculating the new discipline go in with a 50% damage absorbs), the damage taken by warriors will be divided by 4 if they are in defensive, as long as the paladin discipline is working and the paladin is, of course, alive. <P>For exemple, Velketor is actually hitting warriors for around 450 when the Defensive discipline is active. Now with the paladin coming in and protecting his target, the warrior will only take about 250, but the paladin as well.<P>That is a drastic cut down on melee damage dealt by mobs, but i can see 2 things that balance or would balance it. <P>After the Donal's bp nerf, VI knows they will have to tune down some uber mobs. If instead of changing the mobs, they put in such discipline, it will remain the same, clerics need to CH slower which translates in being able to heal during the 10-15 minutes of a fight without the need of a specific item. <P>Another point is maybe to find a downside to this, if we follow defensive working way, i'd suggest while the paladin is in the discipline, he should do less damage as well, or even not being able to do damage since hs is protecting a friend, you can't protect and deal damage at the same time right (that's mainly realistic view)?<P>Or maybe, to make paladins even happier, put it you must have a shield OR Fiery Defender (that sword is epic, it has a shield within it, ie the AC, we can say there is a presence of a god over the wielder granting protection, or that it is so weightless you can use it so fast in your movements you can block attacks with it) equiped to be able to use the discpline. Not only shield is by definition the sign of defensive tactic of fighting, but in EQ it translates automatically in paladin doing less damage as well, which is a necessary thing to balance this discipline. In the case of FD wielder, well, you worked hard for the sword, it is your reward of being able to do more damage, even with the discipline.<P>By allowing this discpline, you help :<P>Warriors are still the best tank, in fact, the discipline is really at his best with them tanking, no doubt on it.<P>Clerics are the best healers and can concentrate on warriors while Druids and Shamans have FINALLY someone they can heal worthy of it in the person of the paladin, cause he is now taking damage, slower than the warrior (because he is not getting hit directly by the mob) which makes new priest classes heal very useful, for once, they will have healing power just good enough to maintain the paladin alive to continue to absorb warrior wounds.<P>All others as we can save their butt by giving healer time to throw a heal in. (hey, rangers would be able to tank for 3 minutes now !!)<P>Until now, noone bothered healing paladins or anyone else than warriors and had druids/shaman sitting in a corner after buffing was done.<P>I personnaly don't know if that should be paladin only discipline or if maybe SKs would need it. But from a RP stand point, i really don't see a SK sacrificing his life for friends. <P>Actually i think making leechcurse healing 3 times the damage dealt during 1 minute, or something along that line, would make up as "defensive" discipline. You should see that with the SKs.<P>The concept is here, the problem is to make it not overpowered and not a "must have", but rather a very nice addition to the group/raid.<P>I really want to know what other people think and how we could balance it.<P>PS : i'm sorry if there are big grammar mistakes and such, english is not my primary language and i tried to do my best to make it a good read.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>On the subject of 1h vs 2h.<P>I prefer 1-handed weapons for a few reasons<P>1) They taunt better, as a factor of their generally lower delay.<P>2) They allow you to select a shield. I like flexibility, and being able to alter the Stats/AC of a shield without having to switch my weapon is nice. What happens if they put a 50AC Paladin-only shield into the game? Our 1H selection is so poor, we may just have to say 'sorry, I have to use FD most of the time, it'll sit in the bank'<P>3) They look better. There are some excellent shield models in the game. and currently, I don't think anyone is impressed by the look of the FD.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I like this idea I saw a while back. Shadow knights are equal or better than Paladins in every way. How about we get a pet like the Sk's.<P> Someone had suggested this :=&gt;I don't remember who posted it, but I love the idea of Summon Squire. As a Knight, it only seems fitting to have a squire to help us vanquish the evil that fills Norrath. Wouldn't this put us a bit more on par with Shadow Knights?<BR>(The other idea of Summon Warhorse is similarly interesting)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Gonna shock you here, I didn't read the whole last post either.  Therefore, I don't know if this has been mentioned either.  <P>I am pretty interested in the idea of giving Palis more weapon options.  I think one of the main reasons why everything for Pali's is 2hs is because of the Balance issues of better 1hs weapons on classes that can dual wield.  You could probably make the Fiery Defender splitable, like the Weapon, leave the defensive Characteristics of the weapons on a Shield, and the Damage delay on a sword.  This would make it basically the same weapon, exept is uses the 1hs skill.  Of course we probably don't want to make such a major change to the current epic weapon, but I don't know.  I like the idea, but I should it's mine.<P>Daelamar Phirestaff &lt;Testament of Valor&gt;<BR>Wizard of the 35th circle<BR>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hail Absor and thank you for taking the time to answer our concerns.  The biggest issue that I have and is so very very disappointing is the books from Naggy and Vox. In it's current state, I will be at lvl 52 for months waiting for a sword that I need for my epic.  All of the friends I've known will have passed me up long before I get a shot at getting any of the Naggy or Vox Books.  Why must I be punished by keeping my char at lvl 52 (and I could get to lvl 60 and try the Kunark Dragons... unfortunatly I don't know 200 lvl 60 people) while the rest can move on?  All of the joy I had in playing the char I love has been removed due to this and by reading the other posts I feel that the post 55 lvl paladin is regarded as useless.  I know the challenge is great but I sincerly hope the team can implement some spell/disc/special ability/or the abilty to at least tank somewhat so that I won't have a permanant LFG above my head.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">   Absor please comment about the books drop rate/obtainability ect..  Thank you. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Greetings yet again. After spending two hours today reading up on all the new posts in the paladin thread, I thought I would come here and champion the best ideas I saw. Think of this as a revised list for your convenience, Absor. <BR>(I'll make it fast, since I have 10 minutes to get to class....) We're really not asking for much. All we want is the ability to do our part in a 50+ group. Having one emergency heal every 72 minutes is currently not cutting it...<P>1) Innate Critials and Crippling Blows on Undead<BR>The more I think about this, the more this makes sense. I mean, come on. Duh. Also, this would fit nicely with #2...<P>2) Holy Forge<BR>Change Holy Forge so that it is a guaranteed crit/cripple upon a successful hit. Fits well with the image of a paladin. Also sort of relates to...<P>3) Lay Hands alteration<BR>Every RPG I have ever played has treated healing spells as DD spells when they are cast upon undead. Chnage Lay Hands so that it can only be used upon PCs (you have NO idea how frustrating it is to slip with the mouse, click the wrong button, and heal a monster!), and undead NPCs. When cast upon undead, it would act as an equivalently powered DD spell. It makes sense to me that a holy paladin, sending a massive charge of holy energy through his hands, would really put a hurting on the undead. At least consider this, please...<P>4) Upgraded Ghoulbane<BR>Create a quest in which the Ghoulbane could be upgraded to a better weapon, a "Spectrebane" or a "Lichbane," with stats along the lines of 25/35 + stats, with the proc upgraded to at least Expel Undead.<P>5) Mark of Karn style spell<BR>Give paladins a reversed Mark of Karn style spell, allowing it to turn a small percentage (10-25%) of the DMG inflicted onto the paladin into healing for the paladin.<BR>A monster hits YOU for 400 DMG!<BR>YOU feel a holy surge.<BR>YOU get back 100 HP!<P>6) Upgrade the Group Heal spell<BR>I couldn't remember the spell name, and EQ Caster's Realm was having difficulties when I tried, but 200 HP is really not much. Upgrade it to maybe 400 or so for the same mana cost and recast time.<P>7) Rez Spells<BR>Move Revive (no exp rez) from 49 to 39. At 39, many people would choose getting back to the group without an EXP rez than taking 45 minutes to find a willing cleric for a 50% exp rez.<P>Add Resuscitate at 49. At this point, clerics can still be annoyingly rare to find when people die, as they are not *absolutely* necessary in a good group.  Many people would really prefer a 50% rez to nothing. I have acted as a cleric quite easily in a group with an enchanter.<P>Keep Ressurection at 59.<P>8) Group Resist Buffs<BR>It's just annoyingly cumbersome to cast four buffs on each person in the group, one at a time. Allow paladins to cast a group resist buff, for the properly upscaled mana cost and a doubled casting time or something similar. This would be particularly nice to have when some nasty critter AE dispells people...<P>9) "Sacrifice" discipline/skill<BR>At level 55 or so, allow paladins, when this discipline/skill is activated, to kill themselves and Complete Heal the group. Exp would be lost as if it was an evironmental or monster-inflicted death. This would still CH the group even if the paladin was down to 5 HP when he activated it. Obviously, even with the 96% cleric rez, a death at that level is a nice setback. The exp loss would certainly keep people from using this very often...And yes, the paladin should be rez-able if he uses this.<P>10) Bash Upgrades<BR>a) Critical bashes. Makes sense.<BR>b) Double-Attack Bash. I like it.<BR>c) Upgrade Bash Damage. I've always wondered why a boot to the shins can cause more damage than a shield to the head.<BR>d) Bash Procs.

</FONT><HR>I would really like the burly troll-er- i mean knoll to stop trolling the Paladin board with false information. He says that we have an advantage over warriors because we can cast, and has no idea how to play a warrior obviously, because they CAN cast, and much better spells at that. Warrior armor is now capable of casting invisibilty as well as many other spells we will NEVER get. So please learn about your own class before you try to attack advancements on ours. You had your chance on the warrior thread. Verant knows you still get a leveling bonus, and clickable spell casting armor whose spells rival many other classes. So please try to present facts when stating why paladins should not get advances. We should. They are long overdue. We have zero advantages over a warrior. This "spell casting" you mention is laughable. Our spells post 50 are USELESS. No raid will be without a cleric. Who is going to want lev 22 cleric buffs in the planes? Nobody, which now forces us to tank which we don't do well. Try to play a high level pally on a hate or fear raid or learn about warrior armor before you post.

</FONT><HR>According to castersrealm, someone said in the corrupted thread:<BR>"How about a new skill, called Blocking? When using a shield, it gives you a  chance of blocking an opponent's attack (much like parry and dodge work). This  would give Paladins (and SKs) a unique defensive skill that relies upon their  role as shield-bearer."<BR> <BR>Absor allegedly replied:<BR>"In fact, most of this is similar to what shadow knights suggested. It certainly  makes sense to suggest that these two classes have the same sort of skills."<P>This would be a wonderfull improvement. Shield blocking should have been in from the beginning. Have you ever broken out the padded wooden 'swords' and such and had a bit of SCA-ish fun? You find quickly that even a  small shield is a HUGE advantage defensively...and a larger one forces entirely different tactics on both sides. <P>IMHO, this should actually be a warrior AND paladin/sk skill...providing the knight classes a badly needed boost in defense while giving the 'master of melee' more options. It would be nice, after all, if using a shield were occasionally preferable to dual wielding. Also, as I wouldn't expect it to work substantially more often than parry/dodge (from a game balance perspective, from my limited personal experience I'ld expect it to go off much more frequently) it would only occasionally be the preference of a warrior.<P>Also, this would allow an auto-shield-block discipline for the knight classes, similar to the ranger's auto-parry one, although more restricted in that it would require a shield. This (or some version of defensive, which might well be going too far)  seems to be the largest single complaint both before, and with, the changes on test. These classes feel they need something to help tanking the uber-mobs. All pure melees already have superior riposte-disciplines, and warriors would remain the sole wielders of the mightly defensive discipline.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Here are some of my ideas on the subject of Paladins:<P>I agree with the raising of the defense cap but not the associated skills like dodge and parry, thus making us ALMOST as good defensively to warriors, but inferior offensively and overall in melee as it should be.<P>I am also reasonably happy with the spell situation with the exception of the overall low performance of the proposed 59 healing spell for the level it requires to be able to cast it.  We should not be able to replace clerics healing power nor come close to it, but a Paladin of 59 years experience should gain more effective healing ability at that level.  I also believe that superior healing should be reduced several levels for Paladins as the closer to 60 we get the more our role becomes healing support (clerical) and less so that of the melee (warrior)half of our class, but this slide begins far earlier in the post 50 levels than 57.<P>Being a defensive oriented class, you will find no other class that equips a shield as much and as often as the Paladin.  Shadowknights do as well, but more of them tend to lean towards 2H overall, and certainly warriors and rogues are seen using shields far less once they dual wield.  So why do paladins bother at all with 2H weapons?  Almost exclusively because several of our quest holy swords including the FA and FD are 2H and because of the increased damage output.  However, again paladins are not the masters of damage dealing, so the 2H choice is situational for when we are a damage dealer, and the 1H is the norm for us in our more typical defensive role.<P>That being said our choices in these 1H weapons and shields is still fairly limited, and its easy to spot a paladin at most levels from his 1H weapon and shield choice.  There were some excellent ideas posted prior about addressing this including implimenting quest 1H swords and shields, having a "turn-in" quest for the FA, FD, Soulfire for equivalent 1H swords.<P>Another newer area that has been somewhat overlooked is the 2H Piercing.  Have a look around any server and see how many Paladins are actively using piercing at this time.  The answer is almost none unless they are training it at the time for possible future use.  Why is that?  Here are some of my thoughts:  2H Piercers known at this time tend to be high delay high damage; this coupled with the fact that this is a brand new skill implimented with velius, there are a great many paladins who would have to start at very low skill and build it over a long time to make it viable.  The high damage is the only reason to use it, and most paladins of such level already have this ability in the form of a good 2H slasher, so why train a long and painstaking new skill just to make it almost equal to the damage you already can produce with another weapon.  The second major drawback is the lack of a shield.  Lances are thought of much as a knight jousting is, but remember a knight jousts with a shield always for protection.  Having a shield with the lance is not so outragous a thought, as the knights did it, many many shaman in the game have the benefit of not only having a long spear in one hand and a shield in the other, but even having another spear in their range slot.  I realize there would be some issues associated with the possiblity of changing "2H piercing" to become 1H and shield usable instead.  The animation is set for 2 hands active, but can easily be changed to the normal piercing animation instead.  If the high damage/high delay existing weapons are considered too powerful for 1H which I do not think they are, then they can be rebalanced with higher delay which would make sense for a lance type weapon.  The simple fact is, I do not see any way that "2H piercing" will become more used as it exists now.  Adding shield usablity to it would give it immediate desireablity, and add variety to the classes viable weapon choices.<P>Some misc. issues I've not seen mentioned elsewhere:<P>The paladin trueheart shield from the Plane of Hate off a level 54ish mob looks exactly like a newbie kite shield that costs 2pp in any city.  Thats just plain wrong, how about giving it an appearance a little more in line with its difficulty, or even taking the opportunity to upgrade it to more of a unique paladin look like on the box cover as was suggested by one poster earlier which I highly support.  Also the Theologan Claymore from the same plane looks exactly like a sawed off blackened iron bastard sword which looks exactly like a rusty short sword, something I would like to see improved in its appearance.<P>Armor of Ro quests:  Quests that I did long ago but had some objections to given the genre.  Part of gathering the metal for smithing involves appeasing the priestess in Kaladim my gathering fairy dust.  This is done by killing fairies who are not evil in Lfay and harvesting their dust.  Even despite the dire faction hits taken by doing so, this is an unquestionably evil act.  There are pixies who ARE considered evil and even brownies (much tougher and more evil and chaotic still) who would more likely be the enemies of Brell than the benevolent Fairies.  Also, another part of the quest metal requires melatite, which is obtained by killing clockworks in SolA, an act which is again evil in my opinion and something that earns contempt in Steamfont and Akanonn by all gnomes except for the necromancers.  Again this does not make sense for a Paladin quest to me.<P>Finally, I would like to suggest a quest item for the range slot for both Paladins and our evil mirror image cousins the Shadowknights.  The rangers are masters of the bow, and neither Paladins or Shadowknights are competent with its use and in my opinion should never be.  However the rangers Raincaller bow makes outstanding use of that slot both as a functunal bow and as an excellent statistic item.  How about implimenting a similar quest item for Paladins (non weapon/bow) based upon their diety.  A "Symbol of Faith to Karana" (Marr, Brell, Tunare, Prexus, etc) could result with slightly varying statistics or resists depending on diety, but whos primary statistic is is armor class.  I would like to see the quest be equivalent in difficulty to the "Divine Might" quest spell in that it is challenging, long, and expensive to test a Paladins faith to their diety.  Some of the best things about the quest is that it is challenging and long but does not involve camping contested spawns or look for rare drops off of gods to gain, more so it involves searching and defending yourself on a long journey thru some difficult areas, and discovering and gathering no drop items off the ground in many places throught Norrath.  Much preferable to gathering 50+ level 50+ people to take down that dragon on the rare spawn day and get lucky with a rare drop.<P>May Karana bless your paths<P>Shadar Shiningblade</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Based on the many posts here and on the EQ message boards about how to balance Paladins, it has become clear to me that we need Defense as comparable to Warrior Defense as Ranger Offense is comparable to Warrior Offense. Even if our Defense is raised significantly, however, we won't be able to accomplish this goal because of the extreme difference in our armor vs warrior armor (much greater than the difference between warrior weapons and ranger's, the "offensive hybrid class", weapons, btw). That's where my new idea for an Epic Mark 2 comes in:<P>I propose a new quest for Paladins that, if they choose to do so, allows them to trade in Fiery Defender for a more defense-oriented combination of Shield and Sword, as follows:<P>Holy Shield, AC 50, 15 STR, 10 STA, 10 WIS, 50 HP, 30 MANA, 10 vs All, effect: Swift Strike (same as Ranger's offhand, adds 40% haste and 30 atk). Nice unique shield graphic.<P>Fiery Protector, 12/20 1HS, AC 10, 5 STR, 5 WIS, 20 HP, proc: Holy Shock. The delay is low so we have an increased chance of taunting, so we will be more likely to make good use of our shield. Fiery Avenger graphic with Fiery Defender hilt.<P>The combined stats of these two are the same as Fiery Defender, with 30 ATK, and 45 more AC, plus haste.<P>This is partly inspired by the Ranger Epic Quest, which gives them an offhand weapon with 40% haste and +30 atk (and numerous other benefits), AND a main and weapon that's 14/24 with tons of stats and a great proc (slow and dot).<P>The combined stats of these two are a bit less than the Ranger Epic Combo (less STR, WIS instead of DEX, less HP), plus quite a bit of AC (due to the shield), minus the damage of a dual-wielded weapon. The procs of the main-hand weapon are similar in power, in my opinion.<P>In trading FD for this we give up offense for defense, and the overall package is not out of balance in comparison to what Rangers get, IMHO. The AC on the shield and sword go a long way towards correcting the AC we lose to Warriors on our armor (not all the way, but close).<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>GENERAL PURPOSE HEALING<P>Background<BR>It is important to define the role of the paladin in healing. Our role is not to be the principal healer in a group. Our role is to supplement the pre and post battle healing capability of the group so as to reduce downtime and enhance group efficiency. Paladins should be able to heal one bubble of health per spell cast on a fully buffed warrior after the battle so the cleric can continue to meditate and heal during battle. Paladin pre-50 are fine. Paladins post 50 is not. <P>Problem<BR>Paladins cannot heal enough post 50 in any situation (raid, experience grind, pickup group etc) with their current spells. There is a significant difference in paladin healing capability pre-50 and post 50. <P>Solution<BR>1.	Move superior heal from a 57th level spell to 54th. <BR>2.	Add celestial healing at level 59. <P>Discussion<BR>Give druids and shamans superior heal at level 51. This allows them to fulfill the role as healer in a low level 50s group. Give them celestial healing or similar spell at level 55 so that they remain viable in high-level groups while not replacing the role of clerics. Give paladins superior heal at level 54. This allows paladins the capability to supplement the healing power of the group without becoming the principal healer in the group. Give paladins celestial healing at level 59. The currently proposed Celestial cleansing is a terrible spell and just worthless at level 59. It would be useful if we were fighting sand giants or monsters that hit like sand giants at level 59 but then again we are not. Give paladins celestial healing at level 59. Greater heal is simply useless in the post 50 game as it heals 1/10th of fully buffed warrior. Superior healing becomes equally useless as characters approach level 60. <P>Absor you stated that it is a delicate balance between clerics, shamans, and druids healing capability. I concur. But I also firmly and passionately believe that paladins must be factored into that delicate and sensitive balancing act. The current solution of giving paladins superior heal at level 57 is inadequate. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Perhaps this would be a nice way to give paladins a pretty nice looking shield too... with partial effect.<P>Also as a note on the FD, I've talked with a friend who's got one and he's rather dissipointed with it after the the DoT was fixed. He'll be the first to admit that the bugged DoT was VERY out of whack, Trakanon bansished him on one raid and he soloed a myconid warrior with the broken DoT. However, the resist rate is far too high now and the short stun is pathetic. Perhaps returning it to a nearly unresitable save and up the stun duration to 6 seconds? It _IS_ an epic weapon... ought to have an epic effect I'd think.<P>Thought for a split 1h slash/shield for epic.<BR>As this would be the defensive combo, perhaps the sword version could proc a group heal? Those are well known for their taunt value and would benifit the party.<P>Just some thoughts.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>While I don't play a paladin and frankly have strongly preferred other tanks in groups, I must say after reading this thread that there is one sole thing that will really make that paladin an amazing group member for both raids or standard xp hunting.<P>The idea has already been mentioned and apparently quite popular and Alan liked it a lot, so I'm just here to reinforce that.<P>If paladins got a spell that allowed them to essentially be a human shield by targetting someone else getting pummelled during a bad situation, he would essentially save the day by allowing the group time to get things back in control. This spell would be an insurance policy allowing groups to survive an unlucky situation and is the wild card that will get paladins invited to most groups.<P>I personally think this should not be a level 60 spell, but something given at low 50s. By this point, most paladins are insanely frustrated with their class and I watch as they are LFG for about an hour or so before logging on their new alt.<P>Give this to them, and make it good please! They totally deserve this. The issues really come down to duration and recast time. Something in line of divine aura would work well, 18 second duration, 10 minute recast time.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Issue: paladins are not terribly useful in boss mob/uber mob encounters.<P>Bad Solution: increasing defense skill; that does nothing to fix the "issue", since a warrior will STILL be "better" at tanking, and actually imbalances the 99.9% of the game that ISN'T the 30 sec to 2 minute boss mob fight.  Having lower melee skills is the price paladins pay for having EXCELLENT healing, buffing, and curing skills and spells.<P>Better Solution: make paladins USEFUL in boss mob fights, perhaps by giving them an unresistable stun/interrupt.  This is consistent with the classes "characteristic" strength, and could be balanced via reset time, duration, etc.<P>Reasonable?<BR>RdT.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>No matter what you decide to do with any of the classes you have my thanks for at least making an attempt.  <P>What it all boils down to is our inability to either take or dish out damage.  The inaffectiveness of our spells and our current disciplines in no way make up for the experience penalty we have paid in the past.  To work so hard over the last couple of years and to be considered worthless at the end is like a slap in the face.<P>What I Propose is you go and actually watch some groups fight both uber and non uber mobs.  Watch a raid of 24 mostly 50+ try and take out a kunark dragon with and without warriors. <P>Personally i think our offense and defence should be the same for every class. Our weapons and armor should be the defining factor.<P>Disciplines are another way to define the class but oh boy holyforge lets me get one crit hit on a mob.  <P>Just remember we all pay the same amount to play this game we should all recieve the same satisfaction and reap the same rewards.  It should be more about how you play your class and interact with others than what your actual class is.<P>Sorry I don't have any real suggestions on how to do this.  Not everyone will be happy no matter what is done.

</FONT><HR>EMERGENCY HEALING<P>Background<BR>Everquest Paladins are often defined by their emergency healing capabilities. Before level 50, paladins have lay-on-hands  (LOH) as an emergency healing ability. Post 50 paladins gain divine favour and wave of healing at level 55 to complement their emergency healing capabilities. LOH has been recently enhanced twice but continues to have a 72-minute recast time. Wave of healing heals 200 points of damage for the high mana cost of 450 and a recast time of 60 seconds. <P>Problem<BR>While divine favour is a limited use but adequate spell, LOH and wave of healing remain flawed in their current implementation. Furthermore, our emergency healing capability is limited to these three spells. <P>Solution<P>1. Decrease the recast time on wave of healing to 20 seconds. Given the extremely high mana cost for this spell, the most that a paladin could cast this spell, on full mana, is 3-4 times. The recast time of 60 seconds severely limits the use of this spell. Even if the recast time was 1 second, I would run out of mana after casting this spell a very limited number of times thus limiting its use to a true emergency. Please decrease the recast time on wave of healing to 20 seconds. <P>2. LOH recast time. The problem is that the cycle time on LOH is currently 72 minutes and this does not change despite your level. While LOH should never be part of the group healing plan, it should be a more useful discipline/ability. I would suggest that paladins should have the cycle time reduced as they gain levels using the following formula: the maximum of (72 - level of paladin) or 30. This provides a very gradual scaling in terms of the effectiveness of LOH so that LOH becomes a more powerful as the paladin gains levels with a cap of 30 minutes on the use of LOH.<P>3. A new spell/discipline. We need a new spell/discipline that allows us to redirect damage at one party member to ourselves. Being the noble knights we are, we should be able to  sacrifice ourselves to save another. There is potential for misuse so I would suggest that this is a discipline and not a spell, and that our ability to sacrifice increases with levels. The ability is gained at 50th level with 50% damage transferal and 2% for each level thereafter. This should have a high taunt factor associated with it.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I didn't really read all of what was read, but why do paladins start with a higher disease resistance but get the counter disease line of spells so dang late?

Paladins should be the ones with yaulp 1-4 not clerics.<P>Undead DD's just plain suck for we palys. Level 49 is the first good DD and it still drains our mana poor pools. If any of you have played AD&D, which I'm sure many of the VI employees have, we all know that paladins are the undead nukers. Turn undead comes to mind, more powerful after a while, and even later, fears em, and POOF dusted Ire Ghast (those are too high but you get the point). Clerics like the fact that they can DD undead, but I prefer my cleric to heal me and not waste their mana on DDing the thing to death.<P>Low level weapons in all of our skills are a must. The only real decent weapons that we can get aren't low level weapons (cept kunark and twink weapons). When I started out, I wanted to get a Langseax, but found out it was warrior only. So I saved up my hard earned cash and went and bought a combine longsowrd, switched to a Minotaur Battleaxe, and then was lucky to know a friend of a friend who sold me a GhoulBane for cheap.<P>Thanx for listening, I hope I bored your mind to mush   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">P.<P>Turquain</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Greetings<P>I feel that it is my job as a paladin to keep as many of the mobs hitting me as is absolutely possible.  I think that we should be the best at defending casters during a battle.  In fact, I think that should be (and perhaps is) our defining role.<P>In addition to LoH, paladins should have a discipline to supplement this purpose.  Some here have suggested a Holy Defender discipline, where the paladin can forgo damage dealing to defend hits against another party member.<P>As my suggestion, please give us an ability to move us up to the TOP of the hate list for a particular mob.  On rare occasions, we should be able to pull something onto us without question.  Could this be unbalancing?  Yes, if a paladin could easily survive such a fight.  If a paladin uses this ability, he should lose LoH if it is up.  The mob's damage onto him should also be increased.  Basically, this discipline would allow a Paladin to die to save the rest of his party.<P>I think that this could even work together with a Holy Defender-type discipline.  A battle is going very badly, so a Paladin uses LoH on himself.  He then uses this discipline to pull the mob onto him.  Then he uses his Holy Defender discipline to not fight in return for better blocks and parries.  The mob still hits him for tremendous damage, and he dies 25-30 seconds later, long enough for the rest of the party to escape.<P>There would be many paladins that would be too selfish to use this discipline, so those of us that would would become rather valuable.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Thanks,<BR>Digren<BR>Paladin<BR>Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>*** Suggestion Summary for Paladins 50+ ***<P>I. Spells<BR>  A. Move superior heal from 57 to 54<BR>  B. Give us a good DOT heal at level 57<BR>  C. Make the Pacify spell line useful<P>II. Melee Skills<BR>  A. Give same defensive skills as a Warrior, <BR>      OR<BR>  B. Use the same skill ratios that were existent<BR>      up to level 50<P>III. Raids<BR>  A. Discipline that will make us useful in the <BR>     55+ raid situation (ex. parry discipline)<BR>  B. Discipline that will allow our bash to <BR>     interrupt ANY mob<P>*** Suggestion Reasons ***<BR>I. Spells<BR> <BR>Up to level 50, Paladins made excellent "support" healers. We obtained the same heal spells as druids and shamans, just at a later level. However, after level 50, the mobs hit so hard and so often that our healing skills are not nearly as useful-- the exact same situation as druids and shamans are currently feeling.  You have already suggested that druids and shamans get superior heal at 49; it only seems reasonable to move Paladin's superior heal down to level 54, and give us the dot heal at 57 instead of 59.<P>As of now, the Pacify spell is not very useful.  It takes 100 mana, and literally 80 percent of the time, it is resisted by blue mobs.<P>II. Melee Skills<BR>Paladins desprately need more defensive skills.  Up to level 50, the paladins were essentially balanced.  However, in post 50 dungeons, mobs hit so much faster and harder than they did before, so we get torn to shreds.  Warriors, monks, and rogues recieved much higher defense cap raises.  Hybrids, on the other hand, were left out in the cold.  I see monks that can defend themselves better than Paladins who are wearing a full heavy suit of plate armor. Whats up with that? They do 3 to 4 times the damage I do. However, I feel that the Paladin offensive skills should remain as they are; we dont want to infringe on warriors, monks, and rogues.<P>Another suggestion many paladins have made was give paladins the same Warrior/Paladin skill ratios as were existent pre 50. This would fix alot of the problems, although I would prefer to see our defensive skills raised equal to a warrior, since we are 'defensive' tanks.<P>III. Raids<BR>In a post 50 raid, what does the paladin offer to the raid? <BR>Buffs? Nope, clerics got that covered.<BR>Healing? Nope, clerics got that covered.<BR>Stuns and Bash? Nope, we cant stun these mobs.<BR>Melee dmg? Nope, we do the least amount of damage of all melee types.<BR>Defensive skills? Nope, the uber mobs that hit for 300+ usually drop a Paladin in less than 10 seconds. Point is, in these raid encounters, paladins bring nothing to the table. The only real thing we bring is lag.  <BR>---We need disciplines that are useful in raid encounters.--- <BR>What good is resistance to fear if your going to die anyway in a few seconds? What good are crits and crips vs undead against uber mobs?<P>Thank you, Alan, for making the effort to fix the balance issues post 50.  They are egregious.  I am looking forward to the future changes, and hopefully I'll be able to at least feel like I am useful to a group.<P>Ashran Trueblade<BR>Nameless Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Paladins at levels below 50 are sufficient.  I was never refused a raid due to my class at these lvls.<P>Paladins 50+ & 55+ just aren't the same.  After the patch today my guild and others were going to take VS down.  I asked a freind "can I come along" because they were not full yet and were still looking for more tanks.  I receive a tell of "sorry, but the people leading the raid are looking for tanks with riposte".  <P>I don't want to be UBER, I just want to be deemed worth of attending large scale conflicts, of which the endgame is mainly about enjoyment wise.  <P>1. No one wants a tank w/o a useful disc on a large scale raid, when they can have a tank w/ a disc on said raid.<P>2. Pal's/sk's have no useful disc. Sk's do have ht but it can be resisted.    No one will take a paladin along for one loh just to save an "important" person in the raid.  That's what cheal is for.<P>Things I think need to be done, and my wishlist too.<P>1. Some kind of defensive disc is warrented.  Maybe a super aggro disc that gives us a limited def bonus and decrease our attack output but makes us the main target, so we could save our cleric/enchanter from biting it.  Sure we'll die, but paladins are all about sacrifice, and It show's now in game with what we play with on epic encounters.<P>2. Make holyforge actually useful please.  Give us 30 seconds of auto crit/crips when the blow lands.  In five miuntes of straight fighting undead I had two crits, one for (65) and one for (54), holyforge now is nothing more to me than seeing the "xxx's weapons is bathed in a holy light"  That's the coolest thing about this disc.  In D&D paladins are undead slayers on par with warriors, this is not too much to ask.<P>3. Make some more epic encounter mobs undead.  I can't think of any other than the dracoliche in fear, and it is more of an annoyance than an epic fight. PLEASE make some undead high end mobs.<P>Wishlist:<P>1. an undead dd proc like divine might that we can quest for, stackable w/ divine might.<P>2. A high end 1hs weapon we can quest for, Soulfire is a joke by the time most can get it due to the expansions and new weapons out there.<P>3. Buffs that stack w/ others buffs that are actually useful unlike resist disease.  When It comes down to large raids Paladins are NOT going to be picked to come b/c of the buff's they can cast though.<P>This is all I can think of now.<P>Renlain Wyrmslayer<BR>55 Knight<BR>TCC-Officer<BR>Lanys servor.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A few issues from a Level 32 Paladin on Xegony.<P>1) Ro armour is the toughest and most expensive quest armour in the game.  210pp for the plat bars (plus more if you don't know someone nice to enchant them); 40-60pp for the Melinite(sp?) unless you're willing to totally wreck your faction with the Gnomes... and god help you if the Gnomes in Velious are also on that faction; 20-30pp for the Sands of Ro because even if you don't buy them you should repay the Cleric for his Symbol buffs;  Soil of the Underfoot is pretty easy to get if you get a little help... but don't expect any Rangers (and very few Druids) to help you.  (And why are you, a holy knight, killing faeries anyway?  Aren't they good creatures?)  Also, it's Lore, so even if you get all your dust, you can only get one Soil at a time.  Mistmoore Granite?  Good luck getting this before Level 30-35 without some powerful allies... don't forget, it's No Drop, non-stacking and weighs in at 2 stone each.  And now I've just learned that you need to get a new Sol Cauldron for each bar you want to make!<P>2) Uber-guilds are starting to really tick me off.  I've seen two Paladins who were Level 30, yet already had a Soulfire.  Don't even tell me they earned it.  (But that's just a personal rant... I know I'll have to wait until I'm around level 43+ before I and my guild has the kind of power needed to take Lucan down.)<P>3) The best idea I've seen so far is making all our Quest weapons 1h-slash.  Keep them exactly as is, or even lower damage by one or two... but rather than do the kludge of a Bash-enabled 2h weapon, just give us our shields back.  By the way, this should start with Soulfire.<P>4) Shield of the Stalwart Seas... the true prize for putting up with being an Erudite Paladin... yet see #3.<P>5) Dump this stupid idea of 2h-piercing... it's rediculous.  You want to say it's representative of a Paladin using a Lance?  Guess what, when you use a Lance, you use a Shield!  The sheer limited number of piercing weapons available to a Paladin ensures this won't be unbalanced in any way.<P>6) I keep seeing people say we should have our dodge, parry and ripost all raised up.  Well, if you want to keep the base ideas of the four classes then do it this way:<BR>Rangers: Don't increase defence, increase dodge.  After all, wearing "lighter" armour like chainmail allows for better freedom of movement.<BR>Shadowknights: Keep defence about 10 points lower than a Warrior, but raise his ripost skill to the same (or maybe just a tad higher).  After all, a Shadowknight is interested in dealing pain and harm, what better way than to ripost?<BR>Paladins: Same defence cap as Warriors, and increase Parry (again, maybe just a tad higher than a Warriors).  This gives a Paladin the "defender" title once more.<P>7) Raise Bash cap for both Paladins and SKs, give crit bash after level 55... the same time Warriors are stepping on our toes with stunning kicks.  Also, give bash a chance to stun those "unstunnable" mobs post-55.  (Heck, give warriors the chance to kick-stun those mobs at 58 or 60... so they can.)<P>8) Increase Taunt cap for Paladins and SKs (and Warriors... make them all max at 252).  Justification?  SK's are cruel and rude, enraging opponents with damage while Paladins are calm and clearheaded, enraging opponents with their sheer ability to keep on fighting when a lesser man would fall.  Warriors are taunting based on a combination of both factors.<P>9) Reduce the cycle time on Harm-Touch/Lay-Hands post 50.  Reducing it by 2 minutes per level ends up having it available once per 52 minutes at level 60.  Reducing it by 3 minutes per level ends up having it available once per 42 minutes at level 60.  About the same as most Warrior/Rogue/Monk disciplines.<P>10) Give Paladins crits against Undead starting at level 20.  (Starting at level 1 is just stupid and unbalancing given the ammount of low-level undead.)  On the flip side, give Shadowknights crits against Animal/Plant mobs starting at level 20.  Notice that this is well after Warriors have begun to crit, and 90% of the Paladins and Shadowknights have lower Dex than Warriors anyway.<P>11) There should be no such thing as a 2h-piercing skill!  In historical situations, most everyone who carried a spear or lance into battle also had a shield.<P>12) Raise a Warrior's Dodge skill cap to 200.  In so doing, you can easily justify raising EVERYONE else's dodge caps by 10-25 points.  Plus it gets the Dodge skill in line with the other skills of a Warrior.<P>That's about it for now...  I know I've covered topics other's have, but I felt the need to do so.<P>And, rather than make a rebuttle to the assertations made by "ageeah"... I will only state that he, like many warriors, keeps lumping all hybrids into one "uber-hybrid" class when talking about how upgrades have been applied.<P>To be honest, if I could play a character who had all the spells of a Paladin, a Shadowknight and a Ranger, plus wear plate, plus dual wield, plus track, plus Lay Hands, plus Harm Touch... yeah, I'd do it...<BR>Unfortunately, I haven't figured out how to play three characters in one body yet.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Since i think That Paladin and ShadowKnight Issues are interrelated, i will post some ideas.  Even though i am a shadowknight =)<P>The Problem with ShadowKnights and Paladins arises mostly at our uses in high level ubber mob raids.  What do we do? We are pretty much worthless.  We add no unique, and therefore valuable,  presence to the groups.<P>However, i have a few suggestions, that, along with the new test server improves, would help both Knights out.<P>-  Raise the Bash Skill to at LEAST That of warriors.  We are the only class, at high levels, that uses this skill, in all reality.  It is also sort of "class defining" but we should make it more so.<P>-  Chance to ACTUALLY stun ubber mobs with Sheild Bashes.<P>-  Perhaps a new skill? "Block"  Another chance for us to defect a blow (perhaps onto a nearby warrior? hehe)<P>-  New diciplines For the Bash skill?<P>-  Double attack-Bash?<P>-  Bash criticals?<P>-  Nice, Procing Shields!  With all the new Kunark and Velius wepons and armor, one would hope to see some pretty cool new shields come out of the Knights.  Ones with procs would be wonderful.  <P>-  Speaking of new shields, Ogres and Trolls need GOOD LOOKING ones... we look like we are holding toys when we equip shields.  How about some BIG proportionate black rectangle shields?? Huh? huh?? =)<P>Of all these suggestions, the top TWO i think are ESSENTIAL... the others would certainly make play more enjoyable and make us more valuable on Planes Raids.<P>I am done so you can read the rest of the posts.<P>Morgonth<BR>Troll Knight of Shadows<BR>Rallos Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'll keep it simple: Two variations of an idea for disciplines that could be balanced as needed.<P>Key Point:  They promote the role of a paladin as someone who takes damage for another in an emergency.<P>Level 55 or 60 discipline where you can target another player, and for the next X minutes, if a blow to that player would cause that players HP's to go below zero, the damage is done to the paladin instead.  Reuse time of Y.  X and Y balanced as needed.<P>Alternatively<P>Level 55 or 60 discipline where you can target another player, and for the next X minutes, if a blow to that player would cause that players HP's to go below zero, HP's are immediately drawn out of the paladin to heal that player back to full.  Healing stops when a) target player's full HP total is reached or b) paladin runs out of HP's and dies.  Reuse time of Y.  X and Y balanced as needed.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Grrr, you're gonna hate me for repeatedly posting things, but I seem to click that "reply" button too soon some days...<P>As for an "epic" 1HS/Shield quest, please DO NOT make getting the Fiery Avenger/Fiery Defender a prerequisite! You'd be affecting five people per server if you did that. The stinking Books of Scale are waaaaay too rare for that. Give us a separate epic quest for a sword/sheild combo if we get another one at all....<P>(Okay I PROMISE that this is really everything I've thought of this time....)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Pytheous said: "I would really like the burly troll er I mean Knoll..."  <BR>and "he has no idea how to play a warrior obviously, because they CAN cast" <P>  First of all, this is a pretty flagrant personal attack on me, which is against the message board rules.  Secondly, if you want to talk about invisibility, I will point out that this spell is available on POTIONS which sell for only a few pp.  So, 2 or 3 times a year (off of one of the hardest mobs in Kunark to kill), a piece of warrior armor will drop that has a spell on it that is obtainable via potions from many npc vendors in the game for only a few pp.  (And yes, paladins can use these potions).  I'm sorry, but I don't understand why it is a big balance problem for 2 or 3 warriors on a server each year to have access to a spell that anyone can get in potion form for 20 pp from an npc vendor. <P>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Our spells post 50 are useless.  <BR>  Ok, since they are useless I'm sure you won't mind if warriors get right clickable 90% exp res, root, stun, and superior heal on our cobalt armor, right?  After all, since these spells are useless, paladins should have no objection to this, right?  <P>&gt;&gt;&gt; Try to play a high level pally on a hate or fear raid or learn about warrior armor before you post.   <P>  Well, I *DO* play a high level pally on hate and fear raids, quite frequently.  I have both high level paladin and a high level warrior.  <BR>       </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055875-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055875-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055875-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055875-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055875-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055875&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055875&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
