</FONT><HR>If you don't like Verant and what they have done to alter the class you play, I am honestly baffled as to why you continue to shell out your money every month to them.  Not one person at Verant is holding a gun to your head saying "Your money or your life."  If you feel SO strongly that your class has been nerfed to the point that it is unplayable, then cancel your account and move on to something else in your life.  There is a real world out there, and I am sure you can find something to spend 10 bucks on that doesn't make you lose sleep at night crying over a computer game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

No, not just the cleric class but others as well.<P>Some are just playing the game they feel is currently the best on the market.  Waiting for something new.<P>I know that once I find something better I am gone, never to return to EQ or any other by Sony/VI (whoever they are now).  Key note there is something better, that does not mean when something new comes out (try it, you may not like it).  Of course I will try to drag all my in game friends with me if I do happen to find something better.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>While this post is well written and explained does not make it correct. I have talked to the upper level clerics in my guild about this becuase I was curious and I am not a cleric. They seemed to agree that they do not see that much of a change. That being said if there is such a big difference find another tactic. <P>I read post about FoH quit becuase of this very topic. One them posted on that thread that they were tired of every tatic they used being nerfed.<BR>Well if I were Verant all I could say was sorry for making a game in which you are constantly challenged and made to stay on your toes. Remember back to Diablo and other RPG's once you beat the game that was it. From that point on the game got boring. Why? It was then the samething over and over agian. Now there is a game in which that is not the case but everyone seems to complain or just the people that post. I love this game if there are changes fine I deal with them I think up new strategies around them.<P>Well that is all I have to say. Go ahead and start the flames I can see them coming now.<P>Aranash Anduril<BR>Paladin of the 40th year<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>if you listen to these boards long enough you will find out that every time a cleric casts minor healing naggy kills him 5 zones away :-)<P><BR>seriously, i to was curious and asked my rl friend who playes a 55 dwarf cleric.<P>He did say the change was felt, but he hasnt really been affected by it.  He does do raids and he does do everything the rest of you are doing so dont start with that.<P>Unless EVERY time you get clobered because you cast complete heal then i dont want to hear it.  Others around you are prospering in the same environment as you are.  As a more balanced class you will feel bad that your better stuff is being reworked, but it IS for the good of the game.  Live with it.<P><BR>btw, people keep on saying competition will kill this game.  Well competition is out now, right NOW and it is doing nothing.  Asheron's Call came out after this game, you say its bad, why must the others automaticaly be sent from heaven?<P><BR>odd thoughts you people propogate here</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Damn, have any of you guys ever heard of root?  Get a druid or ranger to root the target just before the healing starts?  So if the uber mob HATES the cleric so much he can't get at him.  My druid root can last a couple of minutes sometimes and I'd be willing to bet with tanks beating on him, his hate list will change drastically.<P>As a matter of fact, snare the target first, then root and cast root as many times as necessary until the target is dead by the hands of the tanks.<P>Maybe this won't work on the high level dragons that are level 60, but my root is hardly ever resisted by even conning mobs or blue mobs.  It just looks like to me that some tactical adjustments need to be made.<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>i wouldnt mind getting paid by Verant to patrol these boards when im bored, but sadly no..<BR> <BR>I post for the same reason you do, to have my message heard.  You are making what i feel is an eronous statement and i am here to refute it with as much right as you had to post.<P>I feel clerics are in error, i have a druid alt to heal anyway  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"><P>it comes down to a matter of maturity as i see it.  Learn its a game, and go on.  By all means, i support those who would make comments about such things.  However when you go into terms and allusions like the 'Holocaust' and 'ethnic cleansing' then i say its time to tone it down a bit and learn to take things in stride.<P>again, like i had said.  Competition will come, but why assume it WILL kill Verant?  At one point, i agree, a better game will emerge.  However it wont be an answer to your prayers, just simple logic.  By having seen all that Everquest is, SOMEONE has to do better.  I think what is important though is that it wont matter how good this game is.  It could have everything you are looking for and will be replaced, unless your Monopoly or Dungeons and Dragons</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Being in an uber guild I dreamed of getting a donals BP and having full donals. Now after the nerf full donals would be nice, but for looks only. the only thing half way decent is the AC but without stats on all but 2 pieces of donals its hard to justify using over either POG or PoH armor. The day I got my full purple was the BEST feeling in the game.

I have enough proof for myself that this is going to work.  I know my words wont persuade you, but i feel someone should speak up when the boards are nothing but doom and gloom with no real basis in how it is.<P>When your argument can only be won by maybe less than a handful mobs in the game, then you have to look at that and see what others around you are trying to tell you.<P>It may be different or boring in your opinion to kill mobs differently, but the way i see it if people are dying with a 90+ rez right next to them then i veiw that as exciting  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Funny thing is...Verant seems to think that all these effects off the Cleric bp's are overpowering when in fact they aren't really. Verant put them in the game in the first place, they should've realized the profound effect it would've caused in the whole EQ community. Take a census on your servers, how many clerics compared to other clerics have these in their possession?<P>Since the beginning, most of these "nerfs" were aimed toward the uber guilds, and time after time, these people were forced to develop new strategies, tactics to overcome the obstacles verant places in everyday, so far, they've been able to but there will be one day when it can't be done...<P>All these Bp's did enabled raids to go a bit smoother, reducing the amount of downtime and or mana recovery, when you nerf these...that usually means more people will be needed for the raids...and we all know what happens when there are too much people...massive LD.  Maybe Verant should've seen this...notice how every server has atleast 1500+ on prime time to above 2500 on many of them.  Now this is beyond what a normal server is supposed to handle...Verant could either fix this problem and reduce the lag when a large group is raiding a one or un-nerf the changes to the cleric bp's...<P>Rhinaz Swiftheart<BR>Outrider of Tunare<BR>Xev</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First of all, get my name right, second of all, these changes do not really affect those below 50.<P>Third, these nerfs were AIMED towards the uber guilds, where they fight mobs that are harder than Naggy/Vox, these have been in EQ since probably before you started, and we have been killing them without these "BPs" and healing aggro that they just put in now..so don't even try to compare.<P>Some of these zones, SoV for instances, have so much lag when you have too many people that it's nearly impossible to play...LD's occur and sometimes massive wipeouts will happen. These items that Verant put in the game enables to make raids go more smoothly, with less downtime and the like, not many people are needed and the lag will be bearable.<P>As someone stated earlier, if you aren't above 50 and have gone on raids against the so called "uber" mobs, then you probably have no clue what's going on...once you have these BP's and know how valuable you are to a team, then you can see what the problem is...<P>Let's say one day, all the uber guilds on all servers leave...what will you guys do? Cheer? okay...then you in turn acquire these items and become the next uber guilds...you'll see the problems...then you'll ***** about it...what happens? The other people below you will do the same as what you did to the "uber" guilds...<P>You can go and try these zones yourselves, these were designed for the uber guilds in mind, yet they are the ones getting punished, where probably 70% of the population of each server wouldn't even try these zones...so please, before you say anything else, atleast know your facts beforehand before saying anything, thanks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Other people who may agree or feel the same way should not post a new thread with a different spin.<P>How do you think things got changed for druids and shamans.  They needed an upgrade.  They came to this message board for months on end.  At first they were flames and class envy posts.  Then they calmed down, seemed to get together (or one guy with a lot of accounts) and started some decently thought out threads.  Where were you then?  They have had their heals upgraded like they asked.  Yes it took months and many threads.<P>If it were up to you they would not have gotten squat.  You may disagree with everyone, but there are issues with the classes (not just clerics). The only way to get it noticed is to start threads.  Even then one is not enough.  People have to get lots of them started and keep them going.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

They know if they nerf and make the game harder people will play more.  Yes a model may be found that doesnt use this, but this way WORKS to the tune of 300k subscribers.<P>Yes it makes your raids eaiser, but not IMPOSSIBLE.  The healing nerf makes your job that much harder but not IMPOSSIBLE.  That is my humble point to make, and you cant argue it no matter because they are killing things in POG and VP right now with the dreaded nerf.<P>Its about perspective.  Its about it being a game.
