</FONT><HR>First I must say I am not against NORENT Items... I think it is a good way to control items, keys, summoned items, etc.. but currently it has a MAJOR Flaw... LinkDeath... and with the server populations staying at 2500+ it is becoming a more common thing.. Nothing is more annoying that summoning Food/water/bandages/weapons, a backpack of Rings then going LD... or Woot, I just got my Shadow Rapier/Najena's key/etc..... <BR>PlayerX has gone LD<P>Anyway here is my proposal<BR>PUT A TIMER ON NO RENT ITEMS... <BR>There is a timer in game for online/offline time.. <BR>Why can this not be applied to NORENT... <BR>Example<BR>Corpse rot says :<BR>Player online = X Hrs before body rotts<BR>Player offline = X*2 hrs before body rotts (notice no numbers.. example only)<P>Proposed NORENT (not just summoned items, but ALL NO RENT ITEMS)<P>Player online = NO TIMER.. cause hey, your still playing... in reality this could be set to 72 hours or something.. if you are logged in for over 72 hours I think you need to see a doctor anyways<P>Player OFFLINE = 10 Minute timer... allows you to go LD and not loose all your keys/food/etc.. <P>You still maintain item control as people can not just pull the plug to logg out so that they dimensional pockets/keys dont go poof... <P>BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, people can go LD, and still get back in without loosing ITEMS/KEY/ *TIME*.. <P>Thanks for your time</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

So there's something there "in the world" for the server to keep track of.<P>If you go linkdead, the no-rent item is no longer in the world.

</FONT><HR>If course it would change the balance.  Minorly for all the classes, but a major balance issue for Mages.  If mages did not have to re-summon all that stuff after a LD, that would decrease Downtime which is a strict violation of "the Vision".  Plus, I believe that Pets have the No Rent tag and we do not want a whole bunch of rogue pets wandering the zones.<P>The true problem is one Verant refuses to take responsability for and that is the Link Deaths.  I will grant that sometimes, it is my ISP, but on a DSL line that is up 24/7, my ISP problems are few and far between.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

True, given their level of competence, they would probably need a patch to fix the problem, then a patch to fix the patch, but they could get it done.<P>To date, Verant has buried this whole issue -- and their inability to come up with an intelligent and workable solution -- with the line that the game is supposed to have some risk and uncertainty to it.  I'm just glad I never had to say that; it's pretty transparent and makes the speaker sound like a ninny or a liar.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A couple of comments...<P>1) From a programming perspective, none of us know what the implications are, so it's really pointless to even debate these issues.  Someone mentioned that each NORENT item would need an ID or something... well I'm sure they already have an ID or else they couldn't be traded... whatever.<P>The point is that we need to rely on Verant to say whether or not this is possible.<P>2)  From a gameplay perspective, I think that this is a great idea.  From what I understand, part of the whole final "Class Balancing" that's going on now is to eliminate needless tasks that cause downtime.  This is a good example.  But it's not critical, so who knows whether they can do it.<P>My guess is that if something like this doesn't take much programming time and doesn't affect balance, then Verant will do it.<P>To the wizard who put the 10 "rods" into a summoned NORENT bag... you deserve it.  I've never put real loot into a NORENT container... especially quest items.  The problem wasn't with the NORENT issue, it was with the wizzie who was stupid enough to take that kind of risk...<P>Pwyll Swiftcaster<BR>31st Mage - Lanys T'vyl</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This idea is not only doable, its easily done, and a great idea.<P>One poster wrote that it would cause lag because info would have to be sent back and forth. I think that poster is under the mistaken idea that the items on his character are stored on his computer. All items are only stored on the VI server. VI tells your system what your character has on it every time you connect.<P>So what makes this so simple to impliment is that when you come online, you select the character you want to play, and the server would check to see if you have any of these TIMED NO RENT items, and if you do, it checks the time limit of the item against the last time you were in the game, and if the time limit has expired, the item is removed from your inventory. If it has not expired, you have the item when you come back into the game.<P>They could still have NO RENT items exactly as they do now. They would just need to modify things that they decide to let us keep (food, water, bandages, cold stones, etc...) to have a timed expiration. Everything would would remain as it is now. Pets would poof as well. (Yes I am a shaman, and I like having my pet around too.)<P>I also agree with the idea that the time needs to be a bit more than 10 mins. 30 mins sounds fair to me. Too many times, there is a ISP problem somewhere that caused the player to go LD, and 10 mins is often not long enough to get back online. However, since we cannot expect VI to keep everything we had that currently gets lost when we go LD, I think 30 mins is fair. If you cant get back on within that timeframe, you would know you were not going to have what you loose immediately now.<P>Please impliment the TIMED NO RENT idea Verant. There is too much downtime now, and this would help reduce it a little bit.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>They have explained before that they cannot add any timestamp anywhere without making mods they don't want to do because they are too extensive.<P>Here is what they could do, however, that would reauire NO changes to any items.<P>1. Change it so NO RENT items do not go away on logout or LD, but instead are processed on log in.<P>2. When you logout or go LD, a timestamp is saved in a table in memory.  This table holds the last 1000 logouts or LDs.<P>3. When you log in, that table is checked.  If you are not there, or the timestamp is more than 20 minutes ago, all your NO RENT items are destoryed.  Otherwise, they are preserved.<P>Note that this requires no changes to the item or player database, nor any storage on disk.  It just requires a cache of the last 1000 logouts or LDs.  This will easily fit in 40 or 50k of memory.<P>Note also that the changes in the server code should be localized to just a trivial change in the logout/LD code, and a slightly more complicated, but still easy, change in the login code.<P>This solves the LD problem at pretty much zero effort and risk for Verant.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This has already been suggested and shot down several times by Verant.  The reasoning they gave was that to add a field to store a timestamp for an item would require a lot more work that it was worth, not to mention managing that timestamp would place an additional load on the servers.  Neither of which they are going to do.  There have been several threads regarding linkdeath and ways to handle it, and Absor has stated that he has that list and they are going to talk about it, but he didn't know when.<BR>I play a mage, and while Linkdeath is annoying, I solved the problem by not summoning items for myself.  I buy my food/water, summon bandages only as needed, never use summoned bags except to give large quantities of summoned items to other players.  Now if I go LD the only thing I lose is my pet.  It bites, its not fair, but until they accept one of our suggestions, or we can find one that will work within the current EQ system, we just have to suffer.<P>For what its worth, the best "general purpose" suggestion that has been put forth that I have seen is this: <P>The system knows when you go LD versus camp - ie it marks you LD, whereas if you camp, it logs you off normally.  If you go LD, add a "spell" effect like a rez effect, only it doesn't do anything negative to you.  A lot of spells have a fixed duration, so the system knows when the buff is "put" on you.  If you log back in in a certain amount of time, the LD effect is still on you, and you keep any no rent items.  If you log back in after the LD effect duration has expired, you lose all no rent items.  If you camp, then you lose all no rent items just like you do now.<P>They haven't shot this one down yet, to my knowledge, and I think it would take a little creative effort on their part, but its doable I believe under the current system.<P>Akherat<BR>Elementalist</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
