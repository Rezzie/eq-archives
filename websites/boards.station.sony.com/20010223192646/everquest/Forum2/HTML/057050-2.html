</FONT><HR>This isn't a huge deal but it's something worth mentioning.  <P>I started working on the Robe of the Lost Circle and quickly discovered that Robe of the Lost Circle is pretty much geared towards humans since for an Iksar to do the quest requires he do everything the humans do and ALSO get very good faction with both human monk guilds (plus Qeynos and Freeport guards of course) which is not an easy thing.  To the best of my knowledge humans are never required to get good faction with the Iksar monk guild.<P>Would it be possible to have an alternate quest for the Robe of the Lost Circle geared towards Iksar?  Perhaps something which uses the shackles instead of headbands and sashes?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm not sure if anyone has posted this or not but I since I haven't seen it in part four or five of the monk talks, I thought I'd bring it back up.  I checked the EQ manual for a description of the monk, the original manual didn't have any description of any class at all(which seems a little strange).  So I checked the Ruins of Kunark manual and it did indeed have a description, here it is:<P>Monk.  The monk is dedicated to honing her body into a pure weapon, shunning most weapons and forms of armor.  She's very religious as well, and the gods are known to bless monks by magically enhancing their attacks.<P> <P>That's directly from the book and the main reason I posted this was so Absor could see a little of what a monk is supposed to be.  It's easy to see from the manual that monks are NOT supposed to use weapons or armor, our bodies are the weapon, not a stick we pick up off the ground.  Anyway, I hope this helps in some small way when deciding what to do with our class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Monks should be a class that can function well without a single piece of equipment.<P>Monks should run faster.  They are pretty slow for a class carrying nothing.<P>The penalty for being overweight should be increased.  More AC (maybe Block and/or Dodge instead) and slow down the Monk (running and attacking) including when wielding.  <P>Monks should not be using weapons.  H-H should be the best weapon in the game for monks.  Monks should be outdamaging fighters by more.  H-H should get a bump.  Critical hit, triple hit, and/or delay drop.  Add procs to Monk only gloves.  From a roleplaying standpoint if only one class get critical hit, it should be a monk.<P>If you are bumping weapons higher, bump H-H or Monk gloves. <P>Feign Death:<BR>If it see you die, you should drop off its list.  Well this can be abused.  Ok, instead drop to the level of only hit the thing once.  Same for Evade.  Now FD pulling still doesn't work.  This will allow you to keep dishing out your higher damage.  This also makes it a little harder to pull MOBs off your casters, but not a primary Monk roll anyway.<P>Adding to functionality to the special attacks would be nice.  Stun would be nice.  Breaking armor (AC drop) would work, but better on a Warrior.  Maybe another special, leg sweep that acts like stun, does small damage and quick reset.<P>Mend having a chance to remove disease and poison at over 200.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>monks fists are a viable wepon at level 50, 14/30(.4667), they are as good as a yak, damage delay ratio wise at level 40(i am goin from memory) but at 50 they are better than most average wepons you run across, exceptions are wu's trance stick-7/18(.3889) 83pt proc(damage bonus helps), a Knuckle Duster-14/28 (.5), and a jade mace 9/18 (.5). i see 50 monks using cane of tranquils all the time, it makes me sigh, 11/15 &lt; 14/30. but anyways, you have to hit 50 before most cheep weapons become useless. and a jade mace, in primary hand is still more powerfull at 60 then your 14/26 fists, because of the damage bonus to your primary hand. it would be great to improve the post 50 and maybe 40+ fists ratio to reflect all of the kunark and velious gear that is available. <P>also when people say the monk epic is to easy, this is because they just see the 4 battles that are not all that hard, they dont see the 50+ hours for camping raster(who btw is on a despawn timer i.e. if raster spawns in guk and is unmolested for 72 minutes he despawns.), the 50+ hours to complete the sash and headband quest, i would say that the head of brother shin and the skull of dareb are almost as rare as raster, they are just tradeable, and drop in a popular zone, so you can buy them.<P>all monk quests require  camps of mobs that are really really rare, try camping the goblin alchemist in gorge of king xorbb, he is ultra rare. In most of these cases the benefit does not exced the effort. take the Collar of Neshika Quest for example, the quest giver has 2 placeholders that give faction for killing and when you do complete the quest(which by the way is in kithcor) you get a 4ac 9sta neck, though nice it weighs 1.5 wt. the treant fists quest requires 4 components, it took me 6 hours to get 2 of them, 6 to get the ribcage, and the last part is about a 15-20+ hour camp, and all of this for .7wt ac8 3dex +5hp gaunts, imho Gem inlaid are much better and the quest is a lot easier. the RoLC quest is the only quest where the reward is worth the camp, and only in part because you have to do it because of your epic. then you get the rowf which is a nice robe, but you lose the stat bonus's of the 1st robe for the effect, good tradeoff, but why lose the stats? also why can humans not do the shackal quests though iksar's can do the sash and headband quest. which reminds me of the reward for the sash and headband quest, gimme a break, what would i ever do this quest for, if i didnt need them for the RoLC quest?<P>damage delt is a bit low post 50. flying kick is nice, but needs a min damage cap, say = to level. thunder kick should be innate like a rogue double backstab(in my eyes backstab and FK are equally defining class abilities). maybe a spell interrupt. another suggestion i found intresting was the offhand damage bonus. this would solve the problem, you could implament an equal off hand bonus (or a bonus all the same) only if you were using fists, that would make fists a much more viable weapon at any level post 20 (i think) and when you use 1hb you lose the bonus. that would make perfect sence anyways, and you wouldnt have go change any items like the moss covered twig. <P>on monk gear, when kunark was implamented monks were the only class to not recieve right click effect armor, or any armor upgrade(aside from fungi tunic) at all. cresent is nice, but should have been quest armor implemented at the time of the temple of solusec ro and all of the other class Only armor(aside from druids), ie crafted, ivy, etc. monks pull a decent ac from the gear provided, (at 50 i have a 857 unbuffed with a 120 or so agi and 220 or so defence). Though i have a decent ac i think shiverback needs to be looked at. i recieved a shiverback jerkin and legs last night, and though the jerlkin has good + stats, it is missing ac. 11ac is not that good when the other classes get 25+. the legs are only good because they have 7 fire resist on them. i was also horrified at how dumb i looked when i was wearing the legs they look like pajamas. the least that can be done is the black pants graphic, like sanark hide legs. the planar armor should have ac more in line with the RoLC, you have to be a higher level to recieve shiverback anyways.<P><BR>Frenzy Style<BR>50 monk<BR>Brell Serilis</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have played many classes, but my monk is only 22nd level.  I do support monks in general.  My main is a rogue and I don't think monks and rogues should compete like cats and dogs for the same spot in the group.  I know as a rogue really my only thing I bring to a group is melee damage.  I do feel monks bring a little more to a group, but I think monks have a tough time to.<P>I would support monks being able to tank better at higher levels.  I'm not sure I would support monks out damage a rogue or even close to a rogue.  I mean if you really look at it rogues got a one trick pony.  But you always need tanks.<P>You see I think 4 classes wizards, mages, rogues, and monks fight over the same spot in the group.  I would rather see one or two of these classes get better at defence or diversity and  maybe have 2 classes that really do the damage out there.<P>But in general I think monks (especially lower level ones) do get the shaft some what.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I know there is a problem when I'm playing my alternate character, a cleric, and we look for group members and I don't want a monk in the group if I can get a warrior or a rogue.  If I have too get a monk because of some pulling issue which usually isn't an issue anymore since Kunark, then so be it.  But you know, I love my monk, he's my main character and out of my Necro/Cleric/Wizard/Paladin/Enchanter/Monk.. he's still the best, but he's just out classed.  <P>Hand too hand....I can't think of what class I outdamage when using my fist.  I turn the damage spam on, I see the difference, and it doesn't look good comparing a 57 monk too a 50 warrior, and it's just embarrassing when I see what I'm doing when a rogues in the group, I can only hope the other group members sitting there medding aren't watching the damage spam, because that just hurts the other monks out there when they can try too avoid getting a monk for someone that's really gonna do the work.  <P>It comes down too I need too get a weapon, well.. there is 1hb like Jade Mace, that's a pretty good one.  Most classes can use it, that's why it's cheap.  Then there are 2hb... like Tranquil Staff... that's a pretty one.  1 class can use it, and if anyone but a monk loots it, the winner makes a monk.  So that's pretty expensive and I can't imagine the odds of getting something like that.  I used one from a friend once for about an hour, after about the first fight, which I fought alone instead of pulling too the group, because the proc went off 2x in a row, and it just stood there, so I kept beating on it and it was 80% dead and I was 80% life.... I felt like a monk again.  Felt like I could get groups with this thing... Felt like crap, because I realized this is what had too be done, I have too come up with 120kpp+ or by a miracle get just this one weapon and all my problems are solved.  <P>It's not right you know, I shouldn't have too camp for my damage.  <P>ps-Thunderkick sucks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>FD should work the same solo or in a group. dieing in a group because FD wont work when group members are hitting on the mob is a bug. if anything the mob should switch to someone else almost imediatly since they are being damaged. and since this happens even when the monk isnt low on hps you cant just dismiss it as frenzy effect.<P>im a lvl 38 monk and i use weapons.... why? because i cant get a group if i dont. Why?<P>im a lvl 38 monk and i look like a newbie. why?<P>what i would like...... a natural level based regen for monks. warriors get most of the healing anyway. and i mean spread out through their entire life and not just post 50.<P>what is all the focus on post 50 stuff? the majority of the monks are no where near 50. pay US some attention.<P>at 35 we get our last skill. now what can we do with all these skill points?<P>disclipines look like they are designed for RARE occuasions. why not make something that we can use in EVERY combat. several times?<P>if our attacks are magical... add some extra visual and auditory effects. flying kick is just a round kick. how about a good THUD effect? tail attack should have a WHUSH-Thud sound. etc...<P>if our attacks are magical.... WHY MUST I HAVE MAGICAL GLOVES?<P>i agree on monks should have faster natural running if they are carying less then the monk limit.lets face it. every class but monks carry a LOT of equipment. they SHOULD be slower.<P>i would like for FD to lower us on the mobs agro list.<P>i would like FD to stop mob spellcasting.<P>when a monk gets down to half HP the monk starts taking masive damage. because our agility gets reduced because we are hurt. our ac drops a lot. why? if monks are masters of their bodys they should be able to block the pain. this alone would help monks survive better.<P>but most important for me.... WHY do i have to camp items? why must a monk get items just to group? monks should be the only class to be able to group at high levels without having UBER items.<P>as an iskar i just spent 25 hours of game play getting my freeport faction up so that the guards dont atack me. i now must spend about 50+ killing green orcs in the commons to get faction with the monk guild in freeport JUST so i can start getting the pre-requisit items needed for my epic. the newbies in the commons dont like it but it is required by verant that i do this. i will tell you right now that it is boring..... VERY boring. i tried to get newbies or anyone else to help me with the rebby faction quest in freeport. even at 2pp per tail i couldnt get anyone to help me. and i needed 160 tails.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>i play the game to have fun but.. im not having fun. camping isnt fun. period. but i cannot get into groups unless i can prove i am worth it... and that means equipment.<P>i like the ideals of the monk. no need equipment, no need money....<P>but it isnt that way now. i would like to be able to drop all my equipment and be able to function... i cant. i cannot kill ANY blue without armor and weapons.

</FONT><HR>Most monks seem to agree that the amount of damage we do doesn't put us where we should be (better than warriors but not as much as rogues).  Alot of monks also seem upset that we can get weapons that are as good or better than our fists.  One way to fix both problems at once is to implement some critical type hit only possible with hand to hand.  It makes a bunch of sense when you think about it.  A monk is basically a great martial artist.  Martial arts teach all sorts of ways of killing, disabling and stunning your opponent quickly and efficiently.  Obviously we should be able to kill an opponent outright, but a chance for a crit with or without a stun only when using hand to hand would do a lot to balance the class and bring it back to what it should be...a person kicking the crap out of stuff with his/her bare hands.<P>Swarol</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Chickenlegs, would your monk happen to be an iksar?  Iksar do carry a 20% penalty, and they no longer share that penalty with the group.<BR>With regards to warriors leveling faster, warriors have an exp bonus.  They had this even before the exp penalties were fixed.  The bonus was left in because it was pretty small (10%, I think), and because had it been removed it would have resulted in accusations of a nerf.  So yes, warriors do level faster than monks, but not because we have a penalty.  It's because they have a bonus.

</FONT><HR>Well I had a great discussion with several Monks and here are our thought after the brainstorming session:<P>- We all agreed that what we had red about Monks the intention first was that a monk is not as equipment dependent as other classes. This has changes A LOT during the development of the game.<BR>Also we should be head to head with rogues as damage dealers (maybe a bit less).<P>Here our conclusions what should be changed:<P>- As Monks are now more euqipment reliable increase the weight limit slightly.<BR>Our suggestion was:<BR>- until lvl 30 leave it as it is now.<BR>- at level 30 increase it to 20 stones<BR>- at level 50 increase it to 25 stones<BR>- at level 55 increase it ti 30 stones<P>- also give Monks a quest they could do with little help (maybe 1 group) past level 30 maybe 40 for a purse that reduces coin weight by 50%<P>As for damage dealing:<P>This is a very hard decission and really we could not come up with a solution that might not overpower us above rogues so I hope you folks from VI can come up with something. But we need to do slightly more damage as we do now so we are still way ahead the warriors.<BR>For example: I was fighting with a warrior same level as me, I used 2 Wu Trance Sticks with FBSS and Warrior had 2 Lamentations with FBSS, we both were buffed with Swift Like The Wind. I didnt do that more damage that I felt I should do.<P>A Monk Motivation Issue:<BR>I was playing a warrior once and my friends and I agreed that critical hits are the butter on your toast as a warrior.<BR>Now giving critical hits to a Monk would overpower we agreed, but what about giving monks a slight chance to do a critical hit with flying kick? It doesnt have to be much of a damage increase it is just so we also get this "WOOT A CRIT" feeling.<P>Flying Kick:<BR>We all agreed there should be a minimum damage on it.<P>Past 50 thoughts:<BR>We were thinking about triple attack and stuff like that, but agreed it would through in to much balance issues. Then a friend came up with an extremely cool idea:<BR>The KATA of the Masters:<BR>Past lvl 50 you have a slight chance (this chance may be minimal) to do a Masters Kata on a successful flying kick. This would result in doing an additional instant amount of blows. Of course how much blows and how high the damage would have to be balanced.

</FONT><HR>Abashi once made the statement that monks didn't "believe" in magic.  If this is the Verant vision then monks should have VERY HIGH RESISTS to magic.   After all... the reason a caster can harm a target is that the target actually BELIEVES that his spell will work.  Monks should have a very high innate magic resistance, as well as poison, disease, cold and heat.  Why?  Because a monk has a mental discipline over his body and can easily resist such things.  <P>About a year or so ago when they adjusted up all the classes resistances, monks got a minor increase in heat resist where many other classes received bumps to ALL or MOST resists.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sigh...  Just to (hopefully) put the matter to rest:<P>Chickenlegs is (can't believe I'm saying this) correct.  Warriors and rogues level faster than monks.

However, THIS IS NOT A PENALTY -- it's a Warrior and Rogue BONUS.

</FONT><HR>Frenzy, you're wrong about monk fists because you're not factoring in the primary hand level based damage bonus.  There's more to damage output than weapon ratio alone - because there is a flat numeric bonus (based on your level) added to the damage of each swing (which does not vary with weapon delay or base damage or damage ratio), faster weapons apply this bonus damage more times.  For instance, at level 50 the damage bonus is 8, so roughly I believe monk hands become 22/30, wu sticks 16/18 - an immense difference - even plain old fighting batons perform significantly better at 16/20.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oh, and Canes of the Tranquil at level 50 are 19/25...  If I see a monk crying because another monk is using them in lieu of his fists, I hope it's because he's mourning the evaporation of the worth of hand-to-hand since kunark, not because he (incorrectly) thinks those fists are really better weapons (19/25 versus 22/30).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>we all know that a faster weapon applies the modifiermore often, but if the ratio is far better it doesent matter the modifier bonus. and by the way the bonus would only add 2.5 or so at level 50 not 8 to the damage.<P>http://monkly-business.com/equipment/index.php<P>at that site there is a link to a spreadsheet that will do the math for you on your damage per second based upon level and weapon ratio. accordingly i was a bit wrong for the PRIMARY hand, they are equal damage delay, but for the off hand it makes no diffrence. and also a KD in the promary hand will ourdamage  a cane of tranquil any day. but lets see, save 2k for some other item, OR use it for a weapon that weighs 2.5 AND is the same ratio? i think not, that would be a waste of time and plat. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>oh and by the way, the damage increase on a 11/25 with an 8 bonus make it roughly 1 - 2 damage more not 8. how do you get 8 from a +8 damage per hit? you have any idea what kinda damage would be done? lets see holdiing your theory true, if every hp of damage took 1 on your weapon's damage, to hit in the 50's you would HAVE TO HAVE A 50 damage weapon. yea, go figure. think about it a 14 damage weapon hits in the 50's and 60's you better go back to the drawing board on your made up damage delay ratios. the cane of tranquil prob gets about 2 more damage and the fists get about 1.5. if you were to figure it out properly. and that damage is added completely diffrently. but it is true that fast weapons are by far better for the primary hand, but the off hand goes by 100% ratio. <P>oh by the way, i posted that about the cane, because i see monk duel wielding them, and the offhand does indeed do more damage, though the primary does the same damage.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057050-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057050.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057050-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057050-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057050&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057050&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
