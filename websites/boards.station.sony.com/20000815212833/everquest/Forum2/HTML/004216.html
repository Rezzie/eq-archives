</FONT><HR>I know the topic of camping has come up time and time again by people wondering why is there just so much of it, so I thought I'd post this, maybe it will kind of illustrate why its so prevalent in the game.<P>Right now, there are two opposing forces in the game:<P>Force A)  Players who want exp and items, and they want them NOW!<P>Force B)  Verant who wants items and exp to enter the game at a certain rate.<P><BR>To illistrate this, lets look at one item in particular that everyone is familiar with:<P>Jboots<P>I don't recall where, but someone familiar with The Vision stated that Jboots should only enter the game like once every 16 hours or so.  I don't recall the exact number, but it was something like that.<P>Used to, this was accomplished by putting the boots on drelzna in Najena, but horror stories of the camping, kill stealing and constant petitions finally compelled Verant to move the Jboots to be a quest item.<P>Despite it being a quest item though, the original delay, of Jboots entering the game every 16 hours or so, was still the goal.<P>Now this is where the laziness factor comes in:<P>Instead of designing a quest that takes players to 8 or 9 different places running various errands, doing various tasks that would add up to 16 to 20 hours of game play time, Verant instead decides to put all of that time into the spawn of a single monster, namely, the Ancient Cyclops.<P>In other words, instead of making an elaborate quest to take up 16 - 20 hours, someone just said, "Yeah, put that guy in the desert and in OOT, and set his timer to be about 16 hours or so, and that'll take care of the time sink".<P>So anyways, its that kind of issue thats really at the heart of camping, and its not likely to go anywhere.  THe best option is to either a) buy the items instead of camp them or b) just don't worry about camping and do other things.<P>Rotgut<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I hate to say it, but I liked the way the mud I used to play on had it.<P>It was illegal to camp an item that was a quest item. You could go there and wait for it and get it yourself, but it was illegal to "Camp out of the game" so that when you logged in, you couldn't get the item right away, especially on a reboot. In EQ's case, it would also be illegal to bind at a rare spawn.<P>Farming was illegal. There wasn't this need to sit and camp an item to get as many as possible to sell them. But, stuff was on a first come first serve basis.<P>There were other strict rules, and although there were many complaints, it actually made the game more enjoyable. I don't remember all of them since it was long ago (and the mud shut down), but the idea of no binding in dungeons seems like a possible solution.<P>--Cy</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Er, Lockjaw, Rotgut, whatever... erm... you made a thread about this a week or so ago.  And like 10 people answered you.<P>Your method doesn't work.  It does not limit the item to 1 every 16 hours.<P>Let's say there's 16 quest items involved that you have to get.  Each one takes an hour.  So it takes one person 16 hours to do this quest.  Great.<P>So Person A goes to get the first component.  An hour later, he gets it, and leaves.  Now person B is right behind him in line, and now he's working on the first component while Person A is off to get the second component.<P>And Person C will be right behind Person B.  And there'll be D, and E, etc.<P>Now, what happens when person A gets his 16th component?  Off he goes, and gets his Jboots.  Meanwhile, Person B just finished getting his 15th component.<P>One hour later, Person B gets his 16th component, and gets his Jboots.<P>One hour later, Person C gets Jboots.<P>Etc. etc. etc.<P>Please address how you would resolve this problem.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I completely agree with this. Another perfect example is the Paw of Oppola. They wanted people to stop camping Princess Mitty in Kerra who dropped 3 of the needed items for the Paw so they moved ALL THREE ITEMS to the fungus mutant in Upper Guk (camp heaven). All this did was move where people were camping, it didn't stop the camping. You don't even want to know how much time it took me to get this thing and my ONLY choice was to camp it. The idea of just running through a dungeon and randomly getting good loot is fine, but it needs to be random. As long as someone knows that a_spawn_00 is going to eventually drop what you need it's going to be camped. <BR>The hardest thing about designing a good RPG is designing good content. Having a single spawn, on a known timer dropping rare items or quest components is a recipe for distaster.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Exactly Qwinn.  The maximum rate at which things can come in game is tied directly to the availability of the rarest component.  A quest with 20 steps that each take an hour, while being a 20 hour quest, lets items into the game at a rate of 1 per hour.  <P>I'm wondering how rare we need to make things to stop camping.  The easiest thing to do would be to make everything random.  Of course there wouldn't be much point to quests then (e.g. "Kill in lower guk until you get a X and bring it to me).<P>-Gordon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hey Abashi,<BR>Why not make some quests that work like that? Instead of having everything directly tied to a single mob, why not make a few quests that are tired to an area? I know that there are some things close to this, for instance in order to get the fiery vambraces, you have to go to SolA. Even though you can wander the whole goblin area and are not tied to a specific location, you ARE tied to a specific mob that you must seek out and slay and hope he has the item.<P>It seems to me that if you made items that, although rare, did drop off more then one mob scattered throughout a large area, it might help to spread the questing population out a little. I'm not saying change every quest to this, but a few would be nice.<P>Thanks,<BR>--Cy</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>  Yeah the quest items should be on random mobs.  Like to complete Quest X, you need to get Item Y, Item Y drops in South Karana, But it doesnt drop of a particular mob.  It drops Randomly off random mobs?  Random/Random, cant lose. That pretty much destroys camping certain stuff..<P>  now obviously this wont work for all quest, like you need the heart of Dvinn, it wont drop off anything else but dvinn.  No way around that.<P>  The camping is WAY out of hand.  You have ppl that will hide or go invis in a spawn spot.  For example:<P>  I was fighting the gnolls in Highpass, not camping the named for the shield or pgt, but just fighting for exp.  But we were looking forward to killing the named for the Drops.  /ran 100 of course.<P> HOURS later he finally spawns and a necro pops out of thin air, Dot, Dot, Dot, Dot. Dead. he takes the loot and runs.  Unacceptable, but i didnt petition, what good would it had done? none.<P> Random/Random is a good idea, should ATLEAST be Tested, and see exactly what happens.. now of course youll get people crying and moaning thats its bullshi* etc.  But the point of doing this is to end the endless camping.. go out, kill, have fun, make friends, hope you come across the item.  But of course if you did implement this idea live, i think ANY items that are random drop/random creatures should be DROPABLE..  why? well for people in the zone that happen upon the quest drop can sell it or give it away.  which would also make a lot more pc/pc interaction.  and thats always good.<P>Just my 2pp<P>Thundaro Hitusohardo<BR>Master Taunter  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><BR>Master Tank  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Abashi,<P>I have never understood why the overwhelming majority of drops in the game AREN'T random??  As long as they were level appropriate, it seems to me that aside from very specific rp related quest items, 99% of the other stuff that people camp could and should be a random drop.  It's one of those things that baffles me about EQ, because it seems like such an easy fix but it's never been done.  If you made loot drop randomly off mobs then not only would camping be GREATLY eliminated but the fun and roleplaying aspect of the game would increase tenfold.  How much more fun is it to kill a creature believing that there is a random chance they might drop something really nice, versus sitting at a spawn waiting 10 hours for a rare mob to pop?  There are so many advantages to random drops (i.e., camping and item farming) that it's hard to believe the game has gone this long without eliminating the static camped spawns.  Everything you say about the Vision involves greater roleplaying, and the mystery of finding items along the way without spoilers, yet the game seems to be designed to reward camping static spawn points for the same items 24/7.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Items that are given via quest enter the game whenever the quest giver is handed the required items.<P>To date the method used to limit supply was described by abashi above: The longest part of the quest determines the rate the items enters the game.<P>There is another way.<P>Say the Jboot quest was changed so that, on average, each of the components (other than the cash) could be gotten within one hour of "camping" the AC or shadow men. So how do you stop one pair from entering the game per hour?<P>Make the quest NPC rare. He's only around once every 16 hours.<P>So, you're thinking, now you have to camp the NPC rather than the items? What does that solve?<P>Modify that situation like this and you get a different scenario: What if the npc's appearance was predictable? What if Hasten told you that he'd appear each day at 12:00 noon?<P>So now you just all gather at 12 and give him the items right? Nope. He despawns after getting the items. One per day. No camping, the supply is limited.<P>People would be more understanding of this situation. They spent all of thier time gathering the components and now just have to check back at the right time every so often. They know that SOMEDAY they'll get the item, its just a matter of catching him first one of these days.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Abashi,<BR>Why do you continue to miss the point that items MUST be camped.  That's what a quest is.  <BR>Person A needs to kill something<BR>Person A goes to the place where the thing is most likely to be<BR>Person A hunts for the thing and kills it when he sees it<P>That's how it goes.  If it is anything other than this it's NOT A QUEST.  It'd dumb luck, pure and simple.  We may as well just be randomly given stuff as we log in.  Do a random 10000000 and if you get a 1 you get a FBR, if you get a 2 you get an Exe Axe, etc.<P>If you want to do away with camping, make the appropriate MOB drop the quest item he carries EVERYTIME but make him spawn at more than 1 location in the zone.  The more possible spawn locations and the more random the interval the better.  That would be far more interesting than camping 1 room on a know 8 hour time slot - &lt;YAWN&gt; boring.<P>Abashi, learn to want to give people what makes the game exciting and start being less interesting in 'punishing' the wayward gamers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Of course there wouldn't be much point to quests then (e.g. "Kill in lower guk until you get a X and bring it to me).<BR>Gordon"<P>I've been saying to make everything random from day one of playing in the beta. The only thing non random should be quest items which should then be TUNED to proliferate about as often as your random item in the game. I don't know anything about how things work, but the glacier bear and wiltin could each take a player camping them up to 27 hours in probabilty to get. That is too long. <P>Remember that the game is called "everquest". This is a false name when a player is high level and finds that every quest REQUIRES huge camping time to complete. The "wander by and get" stance does not work either, since every other person wandering by would beat you to it. <P>Stop making the difficulty of a quest patience based. As I said in another thread, my druid is level 52 and I got exp for both the cyclops AND the ancient cyclops in OOT at the jboots spawn.  <BR>Then I had to go with a friend and get the rapier and things. That is not an easy quest, and you'd be very likely to only complete it when high enough. I'm not saying have the AC always spawned, what I'm saying is that the current up to 24 hours to camp it is ridiculous. The players level alone should be the hard part of the quest, not his patience. If you made such things MORE rare it would only point out your design flaw MORE and quests would depend MORE upon a players patience. <P>What you end up doing with your "make things rarer attitude" is make the power players get EVEN MORE of an upper hand, and make the semi casual player feel EVEN MORE alienated. This eventually makes customers quit. Maybe today you are not concerned about this since when one customer quits another takes his place. In the long run, however, you will be concerned when you have competition ACTIVELY WOOING those customers away. <P>Which is better to admit this needs to be fixed, or to be prideful and be beaten by your pride later?

</FONT><HR>iggy, I don't understand why you think that if items don't drop off the same mob every time it's not a quest and that the whole thing becomes random.  I'll give you a bunch of ways to make drops random that still maintain the quest element:<P>1)  Have a MOB's spawn at different locations in the same zone.  Hence, you CAN'T camp it.  It changes nothing in the rp sense or questing sense.  It just means you can't stand in spot A to get X Item.  What is the problem with that?  Granted, creatures which need to spawn at a very specific story related location (i.e., a house) can't do this.<P>2)  Have rare items drop from a variety of MOB's in the zone instead of being on a specific MOB that only spawns every x hours.  Again, you eliminate camping because you don't know what MOB it's going to be on, but it's still just as much of a quest, if not more.   It's not "random" as you imply, but just splits the probability onto multiple MOB's so you can't focus on one, and easily camp/farm it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

This ridiculous notion of 18 hour drop times is ruining this game and fueling the war between the haves and have-nots to a fevered picth. <P>When aquiring items or components is reduced to blind dumb luck it removes a great deal of the sense of accomplishment from playing the game. Grizzleknot is one of the rarest spawns there is and I bagged him simply because he tripped over me while I was medding in the rain. Did I feel any accomplishment in this? Ha! It would have been far more satisfying to have done a quest. What's puzzling is that Verant seems to think sitting on your a$$ playing with your pecker for 18 hours waiting for some idiot thing to spawn is high adventure.

</FONT><HR>Make items random I'd say. simply because this game has so much of real life like elements to it. You know, how this world has its own economy and things change by the way this game is played, players deal with PEOPLE, not only some computer generated character like other games. By there are fixed spawn and items that are campable. Also a lot of players camp for those items to sell (sure they need to make money too) and usually those are the ones who has nothing to do with quest or can't even use the item. So what do you think, if you come looking for a weapon that you are suppose to get for your quest, you worked hard to lvl up and only to find out some high lvl wizzie or mage sitting there, blasting and killing a mob that you are suppose to kill in order to complete the quest. I don't think quest was initially meant to just obtain the item. It was meant to let you WORK for your item. I wouldn't complain if you run across some mob and end up getting some item that are for some quests of other race/class. I'd say go ahead and sell it because there are someone who is willing to buy it from you, but having not being able to complete quest just because someone wants to sell the item, why not just make items and mobs random? I'm sure a lot of people would disagree with this idea, but in my opinion, whoever think certain mobs should drop this and that at certain spawn pattern are taking things for granted. As you live in a real life, do you expect things to be the way you think it should be? This game, afterall, is not a real life you live in, but since Verant made this game so very life like, I'd say make things life like too. Not all the items, of course, just most of stuff. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Whats wrong with 'killing in Guk until you get an X, then bring it back'? Many games play this way and they work fine. Randomness is more fun and less frustrating than camping. Heck, you'd appreciate the item more I'd think. Not that camping for hours is less appreciative; but if the chance for the item is random on creatures there would be less camping. Maybe some items won't work randomnly, but I'd still like to see this tested at least.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Even just assuming 5000 people, if you have an item that takes 2 days to get, it will take 30 YEARS for everyone to get one.

The NPC knows who first had it.. but is sure that it has been handed off to another for safekeeping.<P>The thing is.. the endless camping for items has to be the number one greatest downfall of EQ.  Why?  Because the GAME is named EverQuest indicating that there is something more than just hack and slash.  The programmers devised a way to keep items entering the game at a certain pace.. but in doing so they have done a GREAT DISSERVICE to the players and the game itself!  Thing is... programmers can evaluate the mechanics, but there should be someone watching over the game from a PLAYER perspective.. for the playability.  There needs to be a meeting of the minds and an adjustment to how quest items are placed in the game.  <P>Slowing drops, as Abashi seems to recommend will only ADD to the tremendous frustration that so many players are already experiencing.  It's NOT going to sell any FUTURE Verant or Sony games to the players in EQ.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>It's extremely refeshing to read that I'm not the only one who damn near spit hazelnut coffee with cream and double sugar all over his monitor when he read Gordo's statement about stopping camping.<P>I have to agree with the initial assessment.  Rare drops should be rare.  But they should be rare off of one of several wandering mobs who spawn randomly, potentially in multiple zones.<P>Then there's the other problem, namely camping for experience.  A bunch of us (9, iirc) were sitting around this weekend, shooting the bull about games in general, and the topic turned to Everquest.  At the end of night nwe'd come to several conclusions.  First, we were all sick of the game after only 3 months.  Second, camping is in fact a problem created by the game itself.<P>In a question about why conning things at higher levels is such a phenomenal waste of time, it was explained that a single monster at higher levels are supposed to be a challenge for a well balanced group of characters at that level.  This is all well and good when you're outside, farming Axes of the Iron Back for the younger tanks in your guild, or chasing sand and hill giants around just because it's fun to watch them die.  But in dungeons, it's a recipe for disaster.<P>One is a challenge, but there are five in a room.  If we rush in and start hacking, it's going to be a boring night of running across the plains of Norrath.  If we pull carefully and get one (or two if we have an enchanter) it'll be a tough fight, but we might win.  If we get three, soemone may die.  If we get more than that, it's time to take the scenic route back to the corpses.<P>You've said that feign pulling doesn't make sense.  Neither does the idea that we have to gang tackle anything that offers any reward for killing it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>As much as i understand the logic of the rate at which items enter the game i can't say current way is a good way to do it.<P>1. As a warrior i can't take on the AC in OOT myself, so i have to bug someone to sit there with me to even have a slightest chance.<BR>2. AC is being camped in Sro by high level people. And many theories state things like, kill all spiders, kill all mummies etc. So quite often this zone is ruined by players looking for AC.<BR>3. Once AC in Sro spawns it's a killfeast.<BR>4. Once again a 24/7 camp.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>There are two types of camping (camping items and pulling to a camp) and both are related. Camping is the SOLE tactic available to groups because of the slow regen rates of hp and mana.<P>It is impossible to "do a dungeon" in EQ because the healers cannot regen mana fast enough while moving to keep the tanks healed. Even with clarity and manasong this is the case. No one regens anything wihtout sitting down, and healers have to med every possible chance to keep everyone alive.<P>That being the case there is only one tactic: camping. Pull a manageable number of mobs to the group to allow the healers to med as much as possible. This condition holds true for the solo classes such as necros as well. <P>Since this is the case, is makes sense to camp a spot with monetary returns as well as exp returns. Bingo, you are camping for items. <P>This is exactly how the game was designed to be played. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>As far as Quest items are concerned, I don't see the problem making the max wait time an hour or at max two per component.<P>"Everyone isn't intitled to all the items" I've seen this used for some of the subjects by Verant and really this should not pertain to quest items.<P>Everyone that gets a quest from an NPC should get that item. If Verant feels that that item is to popular, get rid of that quest and item and make another quest.<P>I think the main problem in this area is Verant not wanting to take the time to constantly upgrade the quests therefore instead of changing quests they make part of the quest Ubber rare. &lt;-- This makes for the camping problem.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I thin everone here is asking for you to do something better than let the spawn rate of one mob dictate the number of items coming into the world. How ironic that one of my RO armor pieces is tied to a mob that may spawn as rare as a dragon. Give me a break, figure it out guys. <P>If I earn my 20 hour Jboots quest, what do you care that 2000 players have them. All of them would take their time to get it, and I bet you many many many players would not do the same quest again, since there would be no economic reason to do it. KILL THE ECONOMY, and you will kill the camping. Items would be earned by playing and not buying. You would fix the whole E-bay crap also.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Zaldra:<P>Actually there is a difference in what I was asking and your comment. Being that I have now done all the lambent and crafted quests, they still fall into a different category then what I was suggesting. Actually, most quests fall into 2 categories if you are required to loot a body:<P>1) Go to a specific zone, kill a unique monster, loot corpse. Examples of this are the Sentry and Undead Cyclops in South Karana.<BR>or<BR>2) Go to a specific zone, kill a "type" of monster to loot an item. You mentioned Darkforge armor quests. You are still required to go to Cazic-Thule, and loot the crusaders. Yes, they spawn in multiple places, but you stil have to look for them.<P>What I was suggesting is that instead of keeping some quest items to a "type" of monster, spread it around a bit. Why not have decayed armor drop off not only the crusaders, but also heralds, fanatics, and others. Keep the monsters close in level, and keep the drops as rare as they are now, but spread it around a bit. You might even have to reduce the drops to compensate for the increased population of mobs carrying it. (I hate to admit that, but it would make sense)<P>Maybe I didn't word it well on my first post, but that is what I was trying to say.<P>--Cy</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004216-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004216-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004216&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004216&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
