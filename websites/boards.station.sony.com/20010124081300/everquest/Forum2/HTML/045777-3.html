</FONT><HR>Heh...Necros are upset, other classes are upset, other classes are upet the Necros are upset...However, I think that maybe we necros would be better off sticking to suggestions on how to make ourselves useful on raids (unless I'm mistaken that IS the point of this thread) and leave the other classes alone. If I worked at Verant, and there were 300 garbage posts in a thread I started to help a class my interest in helping that class would drop like a rock.  Anyway, I guess I'm contributing to the problem now as I am posting about a non-necro in a raid fixing thing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sigh.. I hate seeing trolls ruin the posts on a legitimate issue.  All offensive casters should be able to do damage WITH SPELLS to uber mobs.  Whether that caster be Mage, Wizard, Druid, Necro or even Shaman.  All mellee's can damage an uber mob, why not all offensive casters?<P>If verant is so worried about not making necromancers more powerful in non-uber situations than LIFETAP SHOULD STICK at least part of the time.   In non-uber situations its not resisted now anyway, so its not changing the balance of power.<P>And give mages, druids and shamans a better shot at damaging those mobs too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR><BR>BTW Nice post Sern!<P>(1)  Group DMF<P>I agree with Sern's #5 point regarding group DMF.  This is a nice-to-have but this in no way, shape, or form affects the ability of a necromancer to be useful on raids.  DMF is the only buff a necro really needs to worry about casting and even a single necromancer can easily buff 40 people with DMF for a Trakanon without breaking a sweat.  (Get regrowth, turn on lich, and then start buffing ... it's easy.)  In short, group DMF is not going to solve any necromancer problems.  Furthermore, the necro robe in VP's only redeeming characteristic is that it is free single-target DMF.  The stats on the robe are horrid compared to the relatively-easy-to-get necro velious robe.  If you do add group DMF, please do something with this robe to make it useful.  (I don't have this robe, but the only other necro item in VP is the broken staff so it's pathetic, yeah, but that DMF robe is the best thing in VP for necro-specific items.)  Even disregarding the necro robe VP comment, I'm afraid that Verant will add group DMF and think that somehow they have improved the necro raid situation.  Group DMF would do almost NOTHING for necros in raids.  Sure, if we were a buffing class and had 4 buffs we needed to cast, sure.  But we are not, we just need to DMF.<P>(2)  Pet Resistances<P>Fear is not the only pet resistance problem.  Getting ripped apart by AEs is as much if not a hell of a lot more important.  Most ultraspawns don't even fear.  Why don't you make it so that bardsongs can effect pets?   This would help alleviate pet resistance problems while at the same time not adding any solo and not adding much grouping power.  It also makes a hell of a lot of sense.  Most players are surprised when they first learn that group effects don't effect pets -- it's not intuitive.  Bard speed songs should affect pets too.  You guys DID say you wanted pets to behave more like PCs instead of NPCs...<P>(3)  Improving Mana Dumping Efficiency and Infinite Mana<P>Absor:  I know we're not supposed to talk about this issue, but please read this paragraph.<P>I am not 100% convinced that our best mana conversion efficiency should remain at 37.5% on the grounds that a necromancer to cleric loop should not result in the gain of mana.  The problem is that this argument needs to take the amount of time required to make this happen into account.  It takes a significant amount of time to fully dump my mana bar on a cleric and even more so to convert mana using demilich.  A 60th level necromancer with demilich can still only convert 310 mana per minute.  At 37.5% efficiency, that's currently only 116.5 mana!  One could argue that all casters have infinite mana because they can sit and meditate indefinitely.  I fully agree that 100% efficiency of mana transfer is too powerful, but I still think 37.5% is too low.  Maybe 60%?  or 50%?  &lt;b&gt;Even at 60% efficiency, we're still talking over two minutes to get enough mana for just one complete heal using demilich.&lt;/b&gt;  Only a handful of necromancers can even cast demilich, the rest are stuck with lich and there the numbers are even worse.  Please Absor, please reconsider the stance on this particular issue.<P>(4)  DoT Poofing<P>Our guild also has not seen this problem in the past half year either.  I have never been told to not DoT something in recent memory.  Although I have been encouraged to cast DoTs.  Like Xerexs stated, the real issue with DoTs at raids is that they aren't that effective.  Half our DoTs are automatically 100% resisted by just about all ultraspawns (lifetap DoT, splurt (shamans cast this one anyway with their epic), darkness, and heart flutter line) while of the remaining ones that do have a chance in hell of sticking on a fair number of ultraspawns (disease, poison, fire line) two of those are cast by the shamans that are present.  So this more or less means that if the mob is immune to fire DoTs, necros are SOL and even if not, the necros have to fight over who can cast it.  And even THEN, that's still only one spell (two, if you stack ignite and pyro).  Other damage casters can cast their damage spells multiple times whereas a necro can only cast one spell.  Those fire DoTs take almost 2 minutes to do their damage...<P>(5)  Conjure Corpse<P>This has to be one of the most overrated spells there is.  I almost NEVER need to cast this at raids.  Most of the time where I need to cast this spell is in small grouping situations.  Let's review all the relevant raiding encounters:<P>(a)  Trakanon.  Yes, if your guild is weak enough to get killed by Trakanon then yes, conjure corpse is nice here.<BR>(b)  Plane of Hate.  Monks pull corpses.<BR>(c)  Plane of Fear.  Monks pull.<BR>(d)  Outdoor dragons.  Anyone pulls.<BR>(e)  Venril Sathir.  Anyone pulls.<BR>(f)  Velkator/Djinni.  Camp a cleric at a nearby semisafe spot.<BR>(g)  Vox/Nagafen.  Monks pull and camp a cleric.<BR>(h)  Kael.  Monk pull or camp a cleric.  (Not sure about SS or Thurg as our guild is allied with these, but I'm guessing it's the same as Kael.)<BR>(i)  Sirens.  Maaaaaybe useful here.  Siren's is currently kinda fubar, haven't figured out tactics here.<BR>(j)  Necropolis.  Monk pull or camp a cleric.<BR>(k)  The Hole.  Monk pull or camp a cleric.<BR>(m)  Veeshan's Peak.  Monk pull or camp a cleric.<BR>(n)  Plane of Growth.  Invis non-KOS/monk pull corpses.<BR>(o)  Random Outdoor Epic Mob Fight.  Not needed.<BR>(p)  Sleeper's Tomb, Plane of Mischief, Veeshan's Temple.  Not really sure here, but given the track record I'm sure it's more of the same.<BR>(q)  Plane of Sky.  Okay, conjure corpse is used heavily here.  But in a cheesy, almost exploitish way.<P>I'm not saying I never cast conjure corpse, I'm just saying it's very, very rare.  (I go through maybe 2-3 coffins in an entire week of raiding on average -- not including plane of sky.)<P>The fundamental problem with conjure corpse is that the player needs to be in the same zone with the necromancer.  Achieving this requirement is usually far more tedious than simply pulling it using a monk or camping a lowbie cleric or paladin ahead of the encounter.  (And a lot cheaper.)  If you changed it so that all a necromancer needed was the corpse or player targetted (but not the player in zone) then this spell would be a lot more useful.  To prevent unethical necromancers from doing nasty things with other people's corpses, simply require that a necromancer can only summon someone's corpse if they've been consented using the /consent command.  This would make necromancers a lot more useful on raids by making one of their spells actually worth casting on a semifrequent basis.  This would, however, also have the unwanted side effect of limiting downtime a little so I'm guessing that Verant will not implement this change.  (It would increase cash burn rate though.)  Maybe this idea can be tied into Aradune's downtime thread.  I have not read that huge thread so I am not sure what issues have been covered there.<P>Absor, again, thanks so much for creating this thread and for listening.<P>Azakar<BR>Da`Kor<BR>60th Demilich<BR>Erollisi Marr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The problem is Verant will only fix the raid problem if it doesn't increase our solo power.  Lowering resist of drains wouldn't imrpove soloing ability since most mobs we can solo don't resist our taps.  But if this still seems a problem, why not just improve the post 50 taps?<P>I remember the day was lvl 6 and casted my lvl 1 drain spell on a griffin that a druid was kiting and it landed.  And since damage spells increase in power with level as mobs increase in HPs, I don't think a lvl 6 necro could have soloed a griffin at 4 dmg per cast.  Our drains being resisted less on raids (32k+ HPs mobs) wouldn't be too much of an upset if you ask me.<P>And (I forgot who said it) to the person that said that other classes are unhappy with their post 50 status, that isn't the case here.  ALL other classes stay whatever they are from lvl 1-60.  A cleric is still a cleric at 60, a druid is still a druid at 60.  Yes druids change slight roles in a group but that exists from lvl 1 druids to lvl 60 druids, they become healers instead of kiters.  Well in 30ish or 40ish dungeons, necros still retaint heir power but are no longer fear kiters.  The problem is that post 50, our powers do a complete turnaround and we are no longer necromancers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am a 57 wiz.  I have many necro friends and we've been trying to think of ways to make the necro more useful on Raids.<P>First off though.  The Necro is already a prime class to have on any raid.  We usulaly do not start till we have one.  Why you ask?  CR primarily, and DMF.  Not to memtion the mana transfer to clerics, or Wizards (VS fights) or Enchanters (PoA).  Also, contrary to what I have read, the pets are extremely viable.  Perhaps not on all fights, (again VS comes to mind), but many, the pet, regardless of it's life span, accomplishes two things 1) deals out damange, however insignifigant, and 2) takes focuse, brifely, away from teh other characters.<P>That being said, in my objective view, the necro has quite alot of use on big raids.  But, it's not neccesarily HOW you WANT to be usefull.  Well it's a trade off.  You can solo all the way to 60 with no problem, something a Warrior, for example, cannot do.  Thus, your class is more atune to solo, not grouping.  I've seen many strides made by the necro community and VI to get the necro more group friendly, and I'm always excited to have a necro near by.<P>I think the group DMF and other resists are a great idea.  Really won't affect alot of other classes.  Also group Feigh Death is a nice idea.  It's almost like an in zone evac for necro's...allowing the party ot get out of a hairy situation.<P>If there is to be a 'Lure type' spell for necros..than waht about MAges?  or Enchanters?  Shaman and druid for that matter?  Should all classes be given the same ability?  I think not, it's just not fair to the wizards, nor to the other classes.  <P>What WOULD be interesting though.  Is an unresistable (or less resistable) Terrorizing Scream or something.  With the ability to stun a Uber mob (interrupt cast, and myabe a VERY brief stun).  Necro calling forthe the demonic forces of death to send a shudder through the spine of the mob.  Stun could interrupt, have a long recast time.  But turn the necro into a more viable combat option.  Giving it something unique, and makeing it so it can't be chain cast.<P>IE- you would have to avid a raiding party of 20 necro's just chain stunning.  <P>Idea could work, but would need alot of testing.<P>Ok now let the servers up so I can play the damn game<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok.. interesting thread.<P>I have some ideas<P>1)  Group Mana Drain.  Let the necro cast a group spell that drains mana from the people in the group to mana for the necromancer.  That would give Necro's even more mana to send, heal, etc.  It only works really in groups since they can only tap into groups.  Make three spells one at 39, 49, 59.  At 39, they can drain 1mana for 1mana per tick.  At 49, 2mana for 2mana.  At 59, 3mana for 3mana.  Make the spell last 10 minutes or so... with a 20 minute recast time.  Or give it an instant recast time but consume bone chips and have it work only once with 1 second casting time... similar to cannibalize except its draining mana.<P>2)  Group skeletonal form.  Call it Strength of the dead or something like that.  This would give the people in the group an increased disease resist spell, possibly AC as well... maybe like 5-10 and this spell stacks with cleric/shaman buffs.<BR>Maybe it will decrease int or something but give Alot of disease resistance and possibly give those in the group a life drain proc &lt;similar to werewolf form&gt;.<P>3)  Speak with the dead spell.  This spell will reduce aggro of All undead to dubious for all those affected.  Make it targetted, not group.  Let this spell stack with invis.  This will give necromancers a much desirable need for groups as now zones can be maneuvered successfully reguardless if there is undead and living mobs in the zone.  Fear is a perfect example, the undead there will be dubious and with invis or camo, the only real threats would be living mobs.<P>Just some ideas these are group friendly spells I think, now if they are balancing, no idea... but I think its interesting and fun to have.  Necro's will be put in groups with bards, paladins, sks, and the like so they can transfer their mana to the necromancer and send to cleric/wizard if necessary... possibly chanter if thats needed as well.  I think I would like to see these spells.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Verant favors the quick easy fix. So heres my realistic suggestions based on others ideas. Really just a few small additions/changes to others really good suggestions.<P>I have been on several high level raids. I am not just spouting back all I have read previous.<P>We cant use Ignite/Chill for several reasons in groups. One, Mellee range is lowered to the small skell size and the mob now looks like our pet(very confusing in the heat of battle). Tanks hate this. <P>1) Ignite/Chill bones - Mob turns into skell in proportion to original, but also is glowing red/blue depending on the spell cast. Mellee ranges remained fixed at original distance. Tanks will still hate this spell. /shrug oh well. <P>2) Lifetaps should be less resistable in uber encounters AND Resistance to said taps should go down after each unsuccessfull casting. C'mon throw us a bone. <P>3) Trucidation should indeed be unresistable in all encounters. This is the 'Ultimate' sacrafice one can make to cast a spell. It is an insult to the necro and the person offering the sacrafice that it be checked for resistance. <P>4) Duckstaff - Not the topic but throwing my vote in. I feel the same as most other necros about the staff.<P>I hope you do read my thought because I feel I was betrayed by Verant to some degree when it comes to the final battles. I think its outrageous that we still "have to pay" -absor in such a manner after all the nerfs we have faced. I am an adult who makes my own spending decisions and I want you to know that things like this have discouraged me from purchasing a second EQ account. Althogh I sincerely want to and have the means to do so.<P>Also, I play a necro because in a group people expect you to pay attention all the time and react accordingly. Unfortunatly some of us do have real lives and things like kids, kitchen fires, acts of God that prevent one from playing with complete focus. Therefore I can not group on a regular basis. Please havesome consideration before poo pooing the solo classes regardless of your Vision tm.<P>And yes, I have nothing better to do atm than post here )<P>Xodd(Soul Cadre)<BR>52 Defiler<BR>Torvonnilous<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have a question - hopefully Zzrazt or someone rational can respond.<P>To fulfill your request to tap (for mana battery/lich purposes) and actually do a little damage in the epic encounters, what would you think if resists were lowered ONLY on the leach/bond/vexing series?<P>I'm just curious if that would be deemed adequate or not.  Fixing the regular taps seems a bit overpowering becuase of the non-epic aspects of the game.<P>Im sorry if this comes off as if I have any say so in the matter, thats not how I mean it to sound, but I am genuinely curious what you think of this?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi all,<P>Why not do this?  Seems to me to be a really useful use of hp/mana/pets on a large raid.<P>Allow you to place your pet (who has a significant amount of HP) in a state of obedience, whom you could lifetap for heals while lich is on, or even a special pet which requires almost full mana to summon to make him inefficient to use at any time other than big raids (where efficiency is counted in terms of hours, not minutes).  You wouldn't be using this during soloing (during this state of obedience, the pet can be prevented from aggroing, or moving until he dies of healthtap), or even basic dungeon encounters, where your pet is better used causing mob damage, and lifetaps against mobs actually work.  Your pet will be useful as he won't be feared, causing massive trains, no changes would have to be made to uber mobs to accommodate necros, their role and usefulness as raid support would increase dramatically with a pool of HP available to them, and the RP implications are exquisite.<P>Think about this in the role of an evil necromancer for a moment.  He raises the dead not only to do his bidding, but commands them to obediently sit and die a slow death while he uses their lifeforce in a grander plan to support a larger effort to cause destruction to a creature of epic proportions.  <P>The necromancer is taking total advantage of poor Xabober, using him as a battery of health which he spreads around as he chooses until Xabober is dead.<P>This could easily be worked to prevent abuse in non-raid situations, yet this would simultaneously make the necros usefulness in raids skyrocket, while not changing their basic role.<P>Thanks for the ear<P>Keliash Wisecracker</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just wanted to say I made a few mistakes in my post the most important of which is Abashi said "necros have to pay".<P>Really folks some of your ideas are way out there. While it is good to throw ideas out there try to think about things like - is there a snow-balls chance in heck of Verant making such a drastic change? Unless you like lip service that is.<P>They want some mundane changes so Necros arent even 'perceived' as being given more power. Necros have a bad rep imho from being so powerful pre-nerf. So now, "we have to pay".</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have seen posts on Possession in regards to Necros and assume this is in regards to pets?  Casting Minion of Shadows on myself and backstabbing would be a a nice change ) .  Anyway, my thought here is what about something like a spell called Grip of Death in which the necro casts it on say a tank or maybe cleric or chanter depending upon the raid and risks.  The player cast upon now gets all or some portion of the necros lifeforce (AC/HP/MANA?) The catch being, if the player in the Grip dies, so does the necro !  A necro giving up his AC/Str and maybe HP to a warrior would still allow mana transfer, just no lich since HP are actually 0 but then could have clarity up for mana regen to some extent.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Why is it that a Necros role completly changes for the Epic Encounter?<P>How does  a damage dealing class become cheerleaders and mana batteries on raids?<P>On the Ignite/Chill Bones spell, remove the effect and the debuff. I say remove the debuff because if it lands then the other necros on the raid could still land the spell without having to wait for the debuff to come off. If you dont want us chain casting it just put a refresh time on the spell.<P>After 56 levels you would think a necro would have earned some spells that would make a difference in the Epic Enounters. But then again you would think that half of the level 51 - 60 spells wouldnt be useless either.....Can you say Essence Emerald and Night Only spell?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
