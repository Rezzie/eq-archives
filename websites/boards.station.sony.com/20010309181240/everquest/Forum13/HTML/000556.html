</FONT><HR>You can follow the previous discussion here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum13/HTML/000455.html<P>About these lists:<BR>First and foremost, understand that this is only a list of concerns to be brought to the Live Team. This is not a list of promises, and I'm certainly not telling you that any or all of these items will be changed or implemented.<P>Also, there are three types of items that I don't have listed here. Epic Quests, Magic Resistances in Velious and Mid-level quests. Those three items were mentioned by enough classes that I've pulled them out for separate examination.<P>All items are currently marked with NONE for status. Obviously we've already started working on some items, you've seen the lists from the patch messages on the Test Server. I will be updating the status for items early next week to reflect those potential changes and with any responses from the team. I just wanted to get these lists out to you fresh.<P>I want these lists to be final as you see them now, but I know there will need to be changes made. So this list is not final. But if you want something added to or removed from the list, please be convincing about the change. At this point I don't want to tack on too many more items, since the team is already reviewing the original list.<P>Thanks for the input so far.<P>Alan<P><BR>Monks:<P>ITEM: Unhooking Feet and Fists.<P>DESCRIPTION: In order to increase the monk’s combat ability, we could allow fist and kick attacks to be on separate timers, so that they could use kicks and punches independently.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Chain Attacks.<P>DESCRIPTION: If the monk successfully uses a Flying Kick, then allow that to have a chance to trigger a Dragon Punch (based on Double Attack skill). If the Dragon Punch lands then allow a chance, based on Triple Attack or something like it, that the monk will try an Eagle Strike. Make this a post 50 enhancement. If balanced properly, this could allow for monks to do more damage in a fun way.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Improved off-hand attacks.<P>DESCRIPTION: Another way to improve monk damage would be to make their off-hand as powerful as their primary hand. Of course, doing this would require a re-evaluation of a lot of weapons to make sure that they were not usable by monks if they would be too powerful (those that were made off-hand only so that they wouldn’t be too powerful in the primary hand).<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Monk Hand to Hand.<P>DESCRIPTION: It would be nice to make it so that monk fists were more likely to be their main weapon. Perhaps increasing the damage/delay ratio for monk fists to make them more competitive with weapons at every level, but especially past 50th level. With the better weapons available since the release of Kunark for other fighter types, it might be fair to make monks fist as good as 16/26 at 60th level.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Dodge, Riposte and Block.<P>DESCRIPTION: Currently these skills cap at about 230 for monks. We might want to think about increasing them a bit. Increasing Riposte might be one way of increasing their damage output as well.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Thunderkick and Flying Kick.<P>DESCRIPTION: There should be a minimum amount of damage done by Thunderkick and Flying Kick. Several ideas were suggested, but for Thunderkick, doing 24 points or even less with a 9 minute recycle combat discipline at 52nd level is pretty weak. The minimum damage should probably be close to the monk’s level or level*1.5. Perhaps level/2 for Flying Kick. In fact, it might be a good idea to look at a minimum damage for all monk specials.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Knock Back.<P>DESCRIPTION: Monks really don’t have a way to interrupt spell casters. Perhaps allowing kicks to do a slight bit of knockback just for the ability to stop casters, starting at the appropriate, level might be fair.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>TIME: Old abilities get new life,<P>DESCRIPTION: How about giving some of the old monk attacks new abilities once the monk reaches higher levels. For example, letting kick critical, or letting punches have a chance to stun. Basically, allowing the old skills to be used to achieve special results as needed at the higher levels (this idea should be abandoned if any sort of triple attack is given to monks, since this would probably make it too powerful). The thought is that at, say, 50th level, one of the skills you gain at 5th might get a new bonus, like stun or something. Same damage level, making it only useful for it's special power. A way to give a monk a special skill without linking it to a higher level skill (making that skill too powerful), and giving it the limitation of much reduced damage.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Mid-level weapons.<P>DESCRIPTION: It seems that there are not enough weapons for the mid level monk, especially of the two-handed blunt variety.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Appearances.<P>DESCRIPTION: Monks are one of those classes that tends to look the same throughout its career. It would be nice to give them new looks.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: 55th level discipline.<P>DESCRIPTION: There isn’t one. Perhaps we could add one with a stun component at that level.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Celestial Fist effect stacking.<P>DESCRIPTION: It seems that this effect doesn’t stack with much. Common buffs, like Call of the Earth, enchanter hastes, bards songs, and Speed of the Shissar will prevent the Celestial Fist effect.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: More balanced weight limit increase.<P>DESCRIPTION: How about spreading the weight limit increase more smoothly over the last ten levels. Perhaps 1 lb. for each level over 50 (though that would take it over the current 22 pound limit). Or start it at 52 and run it up one pound per level up to 59 to leave it at the same limit.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Combat Caps.<P>DESCRIPTION: Why do Flying Kick, Eagle Strike, and Dragon Punch all cap at 230 instead of higher?<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Feign Death.<P>DESCRIPTION: Does it make sense that Area of Effect spells or Damage over Time spells would break Feign? It might also be a fair idea to allow a successful feign death to lower the monk on the hate list, even if it’s only by a small fixed amount.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Feign Death Bugs.<P>DESCRIPTION: It seems that sometimes when a monk stands from a feign death he can only move forwards or backward, not side to side. The only way to fix this is to feign death again. Also, feign death does not work if the monk is in an area where they are forced to crouch, such as the area in Sol A near the lava elemental. There is also a claim that feign death is less effective if the monk is under two bubbles of health. That seems like a bug.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Treant Fists.<P>DESCRIPTION: Treant fists are harder to get than Gem Incrusted Gauntlets. It might be a good idea to consider making the Treant Fists a bit better. (more AC, perhaps Serpent Sight...)<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Dodge.<P>DESCRIPTION: Perhaps monks could be allowed to use their dodge ability when the attack comes from behind. This would represent their greater awareness, and might help to make them slightly better tanks in some situations.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Netted Armor in Kunark.<P>DESCRIPTOIN: There isn’t any. Perhaps something of similar nature for use by Iksar monks. The same goes for Woven and Mesh.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Shiverback Armor.<P>DESCRIPTION: They would like us to look at the quality of this equipment when compared to others of its type.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Sash and Belt quest.<P>DESCRIPTION: How about finishing the sash/headband quest up through the black belt level.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Natural Armor Class improvement:<P>DESCRIPTION: Allow monks to become less dependent on their armor by adding a large bonus for monks that had absolutely no armor on. Perhaps a chart like this:<P>Over 14 lbs: current penalty<BR>10-14 lbs: no bonus, no penalty<BR>8-10 lbs: 25 point AC bonus<BR>5-7 lbs: 50 point AC bonus<BR>0-5 lbs: 100 point AC bonus<BR>or something similar.<P>STATUS: None<P>---<P>ITEM: Black Panther Armor.<P>DESCRIPTION: A full set of this armor weighs 14.1 lbs. This is over the weight limit for monks. I can accept that perhaps it was intended that they only wear parts of this armor, but it might also be heavier than intended.<P>STATUS: None<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>BALANCING THE MONK CLASS<BR>I have been reading though a lot of posts and decided to list here probably the most important points and some of my own suggestions for monks. This would make it easier for you and I also feel(as well as many other monks, you can see from reading replys to your monk post) that you are missing some of our points.<BR>POINT I-damage output<BR>I agree with chickenlegs on his damage table idea, but I do have a suggestion of my own. <BR>-perhaps a very easy way to balance would be to give monks a stackable natural haste on weapons as well as fists. If we have a 50 percent stackable natural haste, we will always be doing at least 50 percent more dmg then the warrior as long as the weapons are similar. I also agree that the monk should do at least 50 percent more dmg then the warrior. At this point, we are at least 50 percent weaker then warriors in defense..maybe even weaker...this includes hit points. A 50 percent defense deficiency should warrant a 50 percent offence superiority. (Not to mention that the speed boosts would make us look damn cool! hehe. Off course, short dl/dmg attacks should be reevaluated for their taunts<P>POINT II-fd rediscovered<BR>Now with the higher dmg, we will be getting hit a lot more, to lower ourselves in the hate list, why not just return fd to its original glory? When every monk was proud to have it as their greatest skill. Let FD completely erase the hate list. I believe the reason why this was even changed was because Verant did not want us feign pulling (I may be wrong but I am pretty sure), but didnt Verant recently change the MOBs so that they will walk back in groups? If they didnt they should. Wouldnt this by itself rid us of feign pulling? Returning FD to its original state would satisfy half the monks who post on these boards complaining how there is no way for them to lower aggro. It would also make the game more fun for us monks...who enjoys fding 20 times just to lose aggro on a mob? Or /q and reloging? Or even taking a fd nap while waiting for another group member to rise above us in the hate list? This just plain takes away from the fun of the game, not to mention the fact that without something similar to this, our dmg changes will make no sense,we will be forced to keep our dmg output low anyway just to reduce aggro. <BR>-Also FD is currently horribly bugged, beneath 2 bubs of health, and while party members are attacking a mob, there seems to be almost no capability for a succesful fd. I have also read of other instances of it failing...the code needs to be looked at.<BR>-Please give us a message to let us know that fd has failed. I know it may not seem realistic for us to automatically know if the mob is fooled. But because of us remaining on standing view we can not see the mobs attacking us...so this does lead to a need for a message such as this. Sure we can switch camera views...but it takes too long and it would be easier to just wait until we take that first hit. The XXXX has fallen to the ground message is just not cutting it anymore.<P><BR>POINT III-armor/weapons<BR>Please look at the monk only armor pieces and make them worth getting over all/all armor. Or at least make them equal to them. Allow us a larger selection of weaps/armor, especially in the mid-level range. Also please give us some new looks on our armors, perhaps even something like a ninja suit...just a suggestion.<P>POINT IV-Resistances<BR>Every monk that has gone toe to toe with a caster mob would agree that we are just insects to them, pests that they can easily dispose of. Even low green casters can do extreme amounts of dmg to us. Blue casters can just decimate us. Please look at either adding more resistances to monk armors, or even better, providing the monk with natural resistances. <P><BR>POINT V-Stun attack<BR>Once again our deficiency versus casters needs to be delt with in the form of stuns.  Perhaps flying kick could stun when a high enough level is reached.<P>Well its all i can do for now, please take a look at them...I believe they would make the monk class much more fun and desirable for all.<BR>Thank you and good hunting<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Stunning attack for Monks is needed<P>The warriors get a chance for there regular kick to stun a mob.  I believe this is the same kick they had at level 1.  If this is the case why not let the same level 1 kick that monks have use the same percentage to stun.  Monks will then have to decide to either do a high damage flying kick or the low damage kick but has a small chance to stun.<P><BR>Warriors skill level max for "kick" is 210<BR>Monks skill level max for "kick" is 250<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It seems you've forgotten something in your posts about class changes.  Since most monks are trying to get more damage, I've decided to try to promote the idea of more defense.<P>I believe that monks should get an additional skill once they get to 51+.  For now, I'll call it Sidestep.  Similar to dodge, but at a much higher percentage.  This will enable monks to avoid far more damage than ever before.<P>Here's the good:<BR>Monks won't need to do anymore damage.  As long as we are able to stay in the fight as long as warriors without an "evade" type skill, we will do more damage.  Monk AC and HPs can stay the same, because we won't be getting hit nearly as much.  Also, without the a taunt skill, monks can let the warriors tank, without disrupting the tactics.  Feign Death can remain the same as well.<P>Now the bad:<BR>Monks won't be viable tanks.  Because it's based on a percentage, monks will have a "chance" to sidestep more attacks.  The problem is that it is possible to get a bad roll, and get killed very quickly.  Although the chances are slim, the possibility remains.  Monks also cannot taunt.  Monks have very low magic resistance (unless we buy/camp something) and low HPs.  A NPC caster can still toast us in a hurry.  Monks also have no way to stun a NPC (except with a disciple).<P>How to implement:<BR>I think the best way to implement a chance like this is to give Monks this ability only at reaching 51.  The cap for is ability should only be 100.  Monks will get a cap on the ability every lvl.  51 will cap at 10, 52 will cap at 20, etc.  At lvl 60, monks will be nearly impossible to hit in melee combat (nearly).  This will also give monks a reason to reach lvl 60, because currently, there isn't much to urge someone playing a monk to get to 60.<P>To sum it up...<BR>Increase damage evasion.  That's it.  Simple and Easy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I can see the increase for damage evasion, but this is needed in the post 50 game as well.  I mean heck, us little guys and casual players suffer because we don't have the time to sit day in and day out to camp some ultra rare MoB just to get RotWF or RotLC or even our epic.  I took me over two weeks to get the fist from the sarnak courier for the shackle of rock and only then because someone told me where it was so that I could back track form my campout preparations.  Monks are fun at the first 20 lvls.  After that it slowly turns into more and more of a chore to play one and have fun.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>LordKalron: No, no, and NO!<BR>Monks do NOT need better weapons! We need LESS weapons, and more damage in our fists! Do NOT turn us into warriors! We have a certain monotony to our class, the monk is played the same from 20 to 60. We don't get new spells, we don't seek out the new baton, simply because weapons corrupt our soul, and are in our way when we fight!<P>Instead, focus on us as what we are, in name and spirit: Body fighters. We excel at the bare minimum of equippement! Who here started a monk because of the weapon damage he can do? Certainly not many pre-Kunarkers!<P>I have read every single post here, and even lots of posts in General, and what really displeases me, is to look at how many brothers and sisters, corrupted by weapons, slowly become warriors with little AC.<P>Verant, Abashi, you have different classes and races in the game in order to add variety to the game, and in order to let each player find the class/race combination that best pleases him/her. The monk was supposed to be a bodyfighter, now he isn't, because we supposedly had much better fighting output than other melee types without having to look for the weapons. This is, in my humblest of opinions, pure BS. Did you forget that we are handicapped by our weight limit? Our low AC? Our (post-Kunark) mediocre damage output? Our inability to bind any other place than towns? Our hellish quests? (everyone who have done the RoTlC knows what I'm talking about).<P>AND, there will always be items that we have to camp for / save up money for. FBSS'es, froglok crowns etc. The myth that we have an easier time than warriors because we don't wield weapons has never been anything but a myth. Hell, the shiverback armor alone.. What a measly reward for the work the monk has to do in order to get it!<P>I have said so before, and I'll say it again. To remedy our sad, sad damage output at 50+, please introduce a SPECIALIZE skill, maybe even TWO, so that the monk him/herself can choose whether to go for defensive skills, or offensive ones, AND in addition, make the decision for himself, whether he wants his damage maxed in H2H or wielding a weapon. Either way, a monk that has specialized in H2H should not be doing more damage than his brother with the equal amount of specialization in 1HB, no matter what weapon. If weapons are meant to be more damaging, don't allow them to do more damage than 5% over what the unarmed monk does, everything else being equal of course.<P>As far as FD pulling goes, I believe that we SHOULD have this working as originally intended. If we're not pulling, we're not aiding the party with much. AND, other classes have their ways of pulling single mobs (several techniques for different classes). And by all means, make FD worthwile, not something as useless as disarm.<P>Damage output: <BR>Give us minimum damage on fists and specials, even so if after level 50. Just put it there! Yesterday, I fought pawbuster and had a quad hit for a total of 7 points of damage. Might as well have missed all of them.<P>Flying kick: DONT output "Patife lands a thunderous kick(24)" please. My normal kick does a max of 119 so far. If the Thunderkick isn't OVER what I can acchive with a normal kick, then it isn't a thunderous kick! It looks like the TK is equivalent to a warriors critical hits. Make it equivalent to the crippling blow instead please!<P>Defense:<BR>Since we're not interrupting casters, nor meant to be main tanks, I do believe that the matter of defensive skills should remain unchanged. Just make sure that the classes that can taunt get better at it.<P>DISARM:<BR>Make us disarm more items! Put them magic items in the mob's inventory instead of letting them drop to the ground. What point is having disarm, if we never get to use it, other than in duel, which happens about 1 hour every 4 months?<P>MEND:<BR>When mend caps, would it be possible to alter it so that it does a percentage heal instead of the normal 80+ HP per bandage? We could even save a warrior without spending all our bandages at once<P>WEIGHT:<BR>Well, if you've read all my text above, I won't even go there. I'd be happy to keep the weight penalty if the above changes were implemented. Mind you, they're not THAT drastical!<P>VISION:<BR>Come on, Absor! We've asked for Verant's vision for the monk forever! Please post a reply to this. We are all shooting in the dark with our suggestions, because we don't know how to give feedback on how to adapt the monk to the vision.<P>I, for one, believe that the monk is:<BR>- Master of unarmed combat<BR>- king of melee (from front)<BR>- Best puller in the game (FD)<BR>- Cleric's right hand (bind wound)<BR>- Humble (too many weapon freaks out there)<P><BR>Patife Kaivalya<BR>52d disciple, Mithaniel Marr<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I see some very nice ideas here. The one I would like to see the most is the Unlocking of Hands and Feet! I have taken a martial arts class. I know it is Possible to punch a target then kick it quickly afterwards. Perhaps to do this there could be seperate delay timers for each type of attack. In fact this would Allow the Chain type attacks mentioned above. Also the Iksar ability Tail Rake should not be attached to Feet Nor Hand. As many of you say...the body is a weapon in of it self. So, therby making Tail Rake a free and seprate attack.<P>I know especially with other classes, the Wonderful job Verant has done as far as armor graphics from Velious. I do agree the monk should have several graphic types to choose from by  his armor choice. Example" I saw an Iksar monk wearing Tizmak armor, he looked very very cool, however we monks know that is far to heavy. So please give us a few more choices in our overall appearance.<P>I posted a topic of "Wu's Boots/Sandals" I would like to see a tailor made pair of Magic footwear become available. As the KICK ability does nothing agaist a Wisp, ghoul, Etc. As stated in that message a full set of WU's armor, tailor made of course, would be Very nice. This Wu's armor could be, for example, the same stats as Cured Silk, except should be weightless or no more than .5 for any piece. Plus it should have some sort of stat modifier, example, Wu's bracer could be +2 Dex +1 Str +1 Sta. Nothing Super drastic. This "Wu's Armor" would be a great step beyond cured, before we monks could get some of the better armors avilable. In fact, I wouldn't mind it being No Drop. So it could be a full set of magical armor, that cannot be resold. If it were No Drop then many monks would tailor, as this is about the most leightweight skill to do.<P>Also, don't get put off by the station name, yea my main is SK, but I sure enjoy my monk. I played a Hum Monk to lvl 20, found him boring, so made an Iksar monk, (Iksar Monk is SO FUN!) who is currently level 12, with only 1 day 3 hours played.<P><BR>theres my opionons, suggestions.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Patife,<BR>     I agree whole hardedly!!!  Monks weapons are thier bodys, outright.  I have not been a monk for very long and this is my first character of EQ, but I have done much research during my upbringing as a monk.  My understanding was that when I went up in levels that my working with my hand to hand would be surpassed in superiority and damage.  Is this not so?  Or, is it just not what the true abilities of a fist wielding monk should be?  Also, I still don't understand the meaning of guilds.  Could someone enlighten me?  Perhaps suggest a guild?<P>Pyraties, 7th lvl of the Ashen Order.    </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Great post Patife!<P>I am a Pre-Kunark monk ... and I will NEVER use a weapon other than my body.  Had I wanted weapons, I would have played a Rogue or SK.  If it comes to the point where a monk MUST use a weapon to be affective, I will retire my monk!  I will still play, but I won't play my favorite character!  <P>I think Patife is 100% correct with respect to the load of bull "it not fair that monks always have their best weapons with them".  2 things offset this perk.  The first is the weight limit (which I love).  Monks are supposed to be poor.  I know the people I group with love the fact that I rarely loot!  I take about 5pp per night in money and item wise I only loot what I need for quests.  The second balancing aspect is the hellish quests that we have for items with marginal stats.  Only the epic weapon and robe of LC and robe of WF have stats that make you drool.  If you have ever done even the Treant Fist quest, you know how long monk quests are.  This is fine with me since I always get "the best weapon available to me".  Of course Post-Kunark this is no longer true!  <P>One thing I slightly disagree with Patife about is defense.  I think monks should be VERY hard to hit, but when they are hit they should be hit HARD!  That is why I think our armor has such low AC yet nice bonuses to AGI.  This is to increase the chance of successful blocks, dodges, etc.  In order to continue with this philosophy, it is necessary to greatly increase the effectiveness of these avoidance skills!  I could also see a slight variant of the above philosophy where monks' dodge, block, etc stay as they are but an addition skill be added that reduces the damage monks receive when hit.  The idea behind this is that most blows to monks will be glancing blows since monks "roll with the punch".<P><BR>But again the MOST IMPORTANT THING is the VISION!  Everything we "say" here is meaningless if we don't share the same vision for monks as Verant does (or at least have significant overlap in ideas).  I again ask you, Absor, to please let us know what Verant thinks a monk should be.<P>I am starting to wonder if Verant is listening.  The only response we have gotten is the "generic" response that Absor put on all the other boards.  I think this bodes ill for us.  I think it indicates that Verant believes "monks are working as we think they should".  I hope I am wrong.  I was just wondering if others are feeling the frustration.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think there is a problem with the idea of increasing damage for Monks.  Currently, Warriors find it hard to keep NPC from focusing on Monks.  Now with a damage increase, even if VI fixes taunt, Monks will still have to feign and stop attacking if we got a damage boost.  So where does it stop?  Will you request that all Monk get the ability to pierce and get an evade-type skill as well?  <P>Damage isn't the only thing melee combat.  In martial arts, the ability to not be hit is just as important as the ability to hit.  Defense and Offense go hand-in-hand.  For Monks to be the king of melee combat, Monks need more defense not offense.  We have offense, not like a Rogue, but we have enough offense to attactive a NPC attention in a fight.  Monks need a defensive skill.  Monks need enough defense to stay in the fight as long as a Warrior.<P>Now I don't want to get Warriors in a uproar, but as far as the pure melee classes go, Monks are useless (when you get to 50+).  Monks shouldn't get more AC, magic resistance, HP, taunt or stun... nope, Monks shouldn't get any of that.  <BR>What Monks should get is the ability to avoid melee attacks like no other class can (with block, dodge and riposte).<P>That won't put Warriors out of a job, but it'll make Monks alot more desired in a group.  Currently Monks are only a mana-sponge, and for us to do more damage will only increase that.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A suggestion regarding some of the monk equipment:  The weights are a little unrealistic for monks.  <P>For example:  A greenwood bo staff is wt 10.0  What monk would use this otherwise wonderful weapon, designed for monks I might add, at the sacrifice of 66% of his weight carrying ability?<P>While toting it about in a weight reducing container it's not bad, but once you get it out to use it it's quite ridiculous.<P>Also, the ranges on items such as Shuriken are too limited to be of real use...usually by the time I'm close enough to throw the shuriken, I've already aggroed the mob.  Once again, carrying something longer range (i.e. hammers) brings up the weight problem.<P>Another issue is regarding the skill Instill Doubt:  Apparently instill doubt does not function if any other specials are in use at the time that Instill Doubt is used.<P>For example:  to use instill doubt you have to hit instill doubt and then wait for the entire ID cycle through the final "kick" to finish.  then you can use another skill (Flying kick for instance).  Should you use flying kick (or any other skill) prior to ID finishing it's "kick", you will essentially "interrupt" ID like a spell, and may not even receive the "you aren't scaring anyone" message.<P>Hope this helps!<P>Genthar<BR>44th level monk of E'Ci</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>For all those monks who want to go with fists only....I have a suggestion that could help...<P>Currently, weapons do more dmg then fists because Verant needs a reason for us to even camp them...Who would want to camp a 8/20 fighting baton if your fist was already much more powerful?<P>A solution to this is to create new quests...A master may ask you for a certain item from a certain mob...you will still have to do a camp and if successful, the master will train you and you will increase your fist dmg/delay considerably.  <P>Personally I prefer somekind of test where the master would summon a few of his disciples or tell you of their locations...and you have to defeat them all to become his student..but thats just my thought.<P>This would fix the problem of fists being weaker but make weapons still desirable...and it would follow the tradition of monks being taught by masters.  You could essentially pick the path you will want to take-weapons or fists.  Make them both about the same difficulty.<P>thank you<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think the single biggest change that could be made that would help class "balance" which is really about being able to get a group post 50, would be to add two more slots to groups.  Make it so 8 people can group and get the benefits from grouping.  Right now every 50+ group needs a tank, a cleric, an enchanter and an evac, the other two spots are left to be squabbled over by the other 12 classes in the game although many places require a rogue too.  If it were possible to have 8 player groups, it would be much easier for the classes that don't contribute to those basic group needs to get a spot.<P>The other changes to the monk are still necessary imo, I just thought I'd mention this idea since it would do more for the player than any other balancing issue.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Heres a thought.  How about boosting hand to hand damage and gaining two more damage evasion skills.  After all, we do get hit rather hard when we do get hit, which is more often than not on the things that give us exp.<P>Suggestions for damage evasion skills:<BR>Iron Shirt Qigong: The monk has a chance to eliminate a percentage (20% to 80%) of the damage done to him/her from a hit.<BR>Maka Wara Qigong:  Exactly as block but has an added effect of a chance of doing 50% of a monks hand damage.<P>I practice Yang Chen Fu.  Dim Mak to you who aren't familiar with the "old" term and Death Touch to those who watch too many movies.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif">  There's alot more to it than the infamous "Death Touch" of which there are several.  There's also stunning and cripling attacks as well as the healing aspects...  But I digress.  I would love to see monks gain special effects with their fist attacks even if it means having to quest for the knowledge.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I still don't see why everyone's so het up about weapons. I don't think they should completely outclass fists, but watch a Jackie Chan flick, Crouching Tiger/Hidden Dragon, whatever, and you'll see martial artists using weapons. Nunchaku, staves, swords (tai chi, anyone?)<P>I do favor a damage increase for monks; I see the logical melee damage output progression as follows:<BR>rogues (not backstabbing)<BR>paladins<BR>shadowknights<BR>warriors<BR>rangers<BR>monks<BR>rogues (backstabbing)<BR>I think unhooking strikes and kicks (and chain attacks, as well) is a neat idea, and it would be a moderate damage increase. I'm not sure it would be enough, though. The method I prefer is a small levelbased damage bonus for the offhand, starting at 51. Say, one point per 2 levels, for a total of +5 at 59. Not enough to raise havoc with the offhand and fast weapons (well, not too much havoc) but enough to be noticeable.<P>Defensively, I like the idea of giving the monks an evade-like ability. Basing it off Feign would be logical, but basing it off Sneak could work too. The reason I like evade is that while it's helpful in a group situation, it's not something that's going to make us better at soloing. I think we're good enough at soloing. What we need is a way to stay alive in high-end groups without burning too much cleric mana.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

How about when feigning death the monk is reduced on the hate list over time.<P>So the longer you remain feigning the lower you go on the hate list. I don't know what kind of time/hate reduction would be suitable, although I would guess a fair amount of lying down would be required for a complete hate list removal.<P>Basically the longer your lying on the ground pretending to be dead the more convined you make the mob that you are indeed dead. <P>Just a thought.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Strange how by wielding a baton in each hand I can suddenly hit faster with them.<P>I like the quest idea on improving fist skills.

</FONT><HR>This is an addition to my idea on a new defensive skill post 50.<P>I think that the new defensive skill should only be active if the Monk is using HTH as oppose to using a weapon.  If a weapon is present in any hand slot, the defensive skill will de-activate.  So the idea is, if you want to tank, it's possible to do so at the expense of the damage a weapon can cause.  This will probably cause more monks to want their epics, to maximize their power.<P>Recap...<BR>HTH = Activation of defensive skill (sidestep), but damage decreased.<P>1HB or 2HB = De-activation of defensive skill, but damage increased.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum13&number=13&thisthread=000556&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum13&number=13&thisthread=000556&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
