</FONT><HR><BR>Well, I disagree with a few things you said Gordon. <P>1. It is part of the tuning teams job to make the game more difficult for players.<P>Please don't try to pretend that isn't part of it. It is, and without any level of difficulty for different things, the game wouldn't be fun. <P>What you were attempting to say (I think) is that the team doesn't want to make normal game mechanics that are inconsequential unneccesarily difficult for people.<P>Beyond that I'll point out that your caster class biases show with that particular bad idea. Melee classes are far more dependent on what they can carry and how much they can carry than are caster classes. They're item and equipment based far more than casters are, and the change to the bags would have harmed Melee players and tradesmen disproportionately. I know this instinctivly becasue I play a melee class, you obviously don't.<P>In closing I'll just say that caster bias is a blindness that runs all throughout this game, and you're not alone by any means in it. It's one of the serious downsides to the game, and to game balance overall. This is just the latest example of it. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Thank you for your consideration and thought on this. (No I'm not being sarcastic). I figured I'd wait to see where this went, and you decided that changes to trade containers would be a bad idea, and changes to quest containers should be announced. Thank you.<P>Simple fact:  some of use lots of trade skills, and have lots of containers. Spit, fletching kit, tailor kit,jewelry kit, Tome, research book.  I use all of these with one of my characters.  That's 6 out of 16 general slots, INCLUDING bank and EXCLUDING quest containers. Add a tinkerer bag for a gnome and you almost have your BANK FULL! Logout-destruction...bad idea.<P>Then Linkdeath...ouch. I'd be unhappy if my jewelry kit lost a ruby when the internet hiccuped.

It is very rare that I get the cauldron and have all the items needed right away to make the ronium.<P>Please..  PLEASE, at least if killing items in containers is considered, don't zap components that are used for that combinable item.  I would absolutely screem if my 2 enchanted platinum bars, my granite, my sand of ro, and my soil of underfoot got deleted just because I did not make the ronium before I camped.  That would be VERY cruel.<P>I hardly post at all on this boards, but I think if you made all combinable containers zap items on disco or camp, then you just might hurt a lot of folks, paladins I'm sure.<P>Noonga of Povar.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I don't carry this around with me normally, because I'm a Ranger, and I don't need it.<P>However, when I'm done fletching, I always stick that jewelry in my fletching kit and put it in the bank.

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;I also believe (not confirmed) that the official EQ Guide states that "free bags" can be obtained by speaking to certain NPCs.<P>Yeah, I've heard that as well. I believe that was removed in the second edition.  There's a few things in the first one that I'd rather not be there  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>The 2nd Edition is a very well-done book, with a good deal of input from a blue-ribbon panel of EverQuest players, some of whom post on this board regularly.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Gordon, one thing you overlooked originally is that some people store in quest containers the quest items! E.g., when gathering ice goblin beads in Everfrost, the natural place to store the beads is in the container you were given for the quest. It would seem silly to store them in a regular box, and then have to move them over to the empty quest container to combine them!<P>I never store anything of any real value in a summoned or combinable container due the chance of looting it.  Heck, I'm so paranoid that I turned off fast-item-destroy after I acquired a few good pieces of equipment after nearly dropping one of my items on the "destroy" button when looting.  Perhaps this is a case where personal style made me a little blind to the way that the "rest of the world" does things.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Swapping item reference to a different one can be done - that's how metal enchantment works. <P>Not really. Metal enchantment is done by a spell that uses one component and produces another.  It doesn't effectively change an item from one thing to another.  Still, simulating this process based upon moving items around in inventory is not something that we'd be likely to do in the foreseeable future.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Is there a way to get back the items you accidentally combine? I lost my squad ring due to a lag-induced wrong button press. The squad ring is worth several hundred pp to me, and is a no-drop item. I tried to force LD but that didn't work, anyone have any solution?<P>No, there is no way to get items back after an accidental combine.  As for "lag-induced wrong button press", sluggish mouse movement, which I imagine is what you are describing, is caused by framerate, not internet or server-side latency.  People frequently call sluggish framerate "lag", but lag has always been applied to internet or server-side latency..<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;What you were attempting to say (I think) is that the team doesn't want to make normal game mechanics that are inconsequential unneccesarily difficult for people.<P>Good point.  I certainly meant "difficult" from a frustrating and annoying standpoint.  Tuning the difficulty of an encounter or quest in game for the purpose of adjusting a challenge is another thing.<P>-Gordon<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Way to go Gordon. I think it's punishment enough when you are in a hurry and instead of clicking done you hit combine. As a newbie I discovered a quest in Queynos that gives you a 10 slot box to collect taxes from the vendors. Don't remember the weight besause that was before I cared about such things. Well after the SECOND time deleting everyting in it with the combine button ( I Used it as my primary holder ) I said buhbye to that box.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Gordon:<P>Incredible response to the situation.  I wanted to make some comments 'as a player':<P>1.  I want to be able to successfully use quests and trade skills.  My enchanter has two full bags of spell research 'pages' PLUS an enchanter research book PLUS a bag of gems (for jewelry) PLUS a jewelcraft bag PLUS a tailoring kit.  He also used to have a bag full of tailoring items (patterns and silk mainly), but decided it was too much 'stuff'.<P>2.  Between the 'inventory' and the 'bank' I have 16 container slots total.  The aforementioned enchanter carries a bag of food and water, half a bag of bandages, half a bag of gems (for Rune), half a bag of tiny daggers (yes, I still use the spell in certain circumstances), a bag that tends to fill up of spell research components (plus the two in the bank to work against.<P>3.  As I grow my character, there are lots of 'memoirs' I enjoy keeping.  My rogue on Bristlebane has EVERY magic weapon that she ever swung and drew blood.  She's kind of funny about things like that, but it is part of what makes that CHARACTER different from the rat-pack enchanter.  She also has at least two bags of poison-related 'shtuff' at any time.<P>4.  Quests 'in-progress' require space, too, and usually a full container slot in hand and sometimes one in the bank (not all quests get to be solved linearly by the average player...only uber-guild membership 'guarantees' linear quest solutions.)<P>My point?  Just let players play the game.  Focusing on trivia like this cannot possibly make the game more 'fun'.  If you felt it was important in the original game to limit bags to only one purpose (or more specifically only to one item), then you would have hired additional programmers to make sure that priority made it in the game.  <P>Instead, Verant realized that whether bags could ONLY hold their quest items wasn't any big deal and there were bigger 'rocks' to implement.  <P>Rocks refer to an illustration from Stephen Covey's books:  imagine that you have a jar and a collection of sand, water, gravel, and rocks.  How do you put as much as possible in the jar?  Answer:  Start with the rocks, proceed to gravel, sand, and rocks.  'Settling' allows the smaller items to fill spaces around the bigger items.  Message?  Always go for the 'big rocks' first from a prioritization viewpoint--the things that have the BIGGEST impact.<P>Again, I appreciate the admission that your earlier response was overboard, but it troubles me that Verant often seems more interesting in wielding power over EQ than in making the game environment 'better'.  <P>I would hope the entire team would take the lesson to heart and work HARD to consider whether or not a proposed change is for the betterment of the game or in essence just shows who is in charge of the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hey..<P>Interesting stuff here.  I've talked this over /w my friend, the pros and cons and such.<P>Over all, I think it's kind of unfair.  I mean a backpack costs less than a large sewing kit for example.  So if a person wants to use a more expensive "bag" that has the ability to destroy everything inside IF they click the combine button, then so bet it.<P>However, in terms of "free" bags, I do see your side of the story.  Although how much of a loss is it, only a "handful" of PP "lost" to the game if a person uses "free" bags.  Plus, as stated before, it's a joke if a player can not store items intended for a quest in the container.<BR>As a young necro I did the fire beetle eye quest in Neriak many many times.  Tell me then, how foolish it would be for us NOT to reliably store those eyes in the box.  That is a joke really.<P>Joke I say!  One can't store jewels in a jeweler's kit, etc. !?  Hmm..  <P>But whatever, I think I'm being very biased on the subject.  If you do make this change, at least make it so these "free"/kit containers are not auto filled when you right click an item to loot it from a corpse..  else all these neat things im looting well be lost if I say go LD.  Very not cool.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Bregalad, I read your post just fine.<P>Sorry, I should have commented on this in the earlier post, but what you proposed is actually MORE complex than just making containers nestable.<P>If they can't make the containers nest (which I adimit may very well be extremely difficult in their current system, but all that does is point out an absolutely horribly designed system, which, through inference based on what things they are able to do easily, and which things they say they cannot feasibly do, I actually already know is the case), what makes you believe they can do something more complex (and more convoluted, I might add).<P>Actually, thinking about that convoluted bit, maybe you're right.  If they were going to do anything of the sort, that would be the path they would take, because it would be the worst possible choice.<P>Ah well.  Everybody else in the thread seems to be praising Abashi, so who am I to naysay.<P>Although I do feel compelled to repeat that his comments read as a threat even without taking them "out of context", which obviously has a different meaning to Abashi than it does to me.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I myself have an 8 slot bag, for a rare drop (not REAL rare, but rare enough) In an EXTREMELY laggy zone (Swamp of no hope). I have collected 4 of these things in 2 days (I am a casual gamer) which represents about 5 hours or so worth of work, to complete a quest, which is REQUIRED to complete other quests (geozite tool - required for the warrior pike quests) - Since my idea of Fun - includes doing these quests, I thought it was worth mentioning that a person, doing a quest, might have items in a bag FOR the quest for several sessions. This isnt just an issue for trade folks. (I typically only carry one of my trade containers at a time, so I have room for other stuff.) - I realise, you already said you would not mess with the containers, I just thought I would mention, there are IN CONTEXT reasons not to do it as well.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
