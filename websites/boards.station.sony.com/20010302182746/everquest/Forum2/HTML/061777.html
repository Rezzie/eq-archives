Why should these planes become uber just because a small group of players have finally leveled over 55?  <P>There has to still be viable content for armor/items for the 46 to 51 crowd.

</FONT><HR>"Fear/Hate is much harder than 90% of Growth"<P>Hate is harder than PoG?...... How do you figure.<P>Fear.. Tactics to breaking Fear used to be harder, north camp makes it simple.<P>Growth is "harder" mainly because of the level/difficulty of mobs.. Mobs in fear/hate are much easier than pog mobs.<P>If fear/hate mobs were upgraded to PoG difficulty then lv46-50 people would have no chance at any planes...<P>I don't understand what is "wrong" about leaving a plane alone and NOT upgrading it for the purpose of lower level people being able to do them..<P>One reason you may say that PoG is "easier" is because for level 60 people, PoG is EASIER than PoF is for level 50 people, see my point?<P>Fear/Hate mobs ranged from 48-52 and 55 for gods, when the highest level was 50.<P>PoG mobs range from around, 53 is the lowest, to 60 for 'normal' mobs, then up to like 75 for Tunare or something.<P>The reason people have such an easy time with most of PoG is because they were 60 when it was released.<P>So to say PoG is "easier" than PoF/PoH is wrong I think.<P>Anyways, all I'm trying to say is leave PoF/PoH for the people who are like 46-55 range.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well it depends, if you use the gimp north wall and sw corner in hate they're easier, otherwise west side of PoG is way easier. East side is kinda hard, pathing sucks and stuff can't be mezzed but you have to consider the best armor in the game comes from there. I personally think west side should be buffed and in turn armor drop rates would increase.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

If the necro has more power, then Inny should be worshipping the necro.<P>The dieties themselves should be buffed. However, the rest of the plane should be left alone. Also, since you can now get upgrades when you move out of these two planes and into the others, the items within should no longer be NO DROP, but simply require the owner to be level 46 in order to equip them. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Okay, please get your facts straight before you come in here....let's shoot this down once and for all.<P><BR>1)  The level of the Gods are being upped to 60+ish.  This was stated that it would happen a -long- time ago.  The fact that two well rounded groups of lvl 57+'s can knock down Cazic is a joke.  His loot table is being upped, as well as is his difficulty.  The loot on him ~now~ is being moved to more appropriately leveled mobs.<P>2)  PoG -is- harder then PoH and PoF were at lvl 50ish.  PoS is the only plane that's nigh impossible at the level range that was available when it was first opened. How much harder it is, depends on the crowds you ran with for PoF and PoH, and with the crowds you run with for PoG.<P>3)  The mobs in PoG range from lvl 48 to 70.  The Whorl at the zone in conned even to a lvl 50.<P>4)  For you people saying, "Leave the planes alone!  Leave them for us low level people!"  Say that when you've reached 58 and Hate/Fear is a joke.  You're the same reason we have to rely on twinks to take out Naggy so we can do the Ragefire part of the cleric epic.  Besides, you'll still have 98% of the zone to do, and still can kill stuff to get the previous God-level equipment.

Some of you have developed the idea that the planes are just the beginning of the 50+ game.  They were designed to be the most challenging zones in the game--IMHO they should have been scaled up when Kunark was released (drops included) or at least with the addition of the new Velious planes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think the idea of buffing up PoF or PoH is stupid. Not everyone started when the game came out, a lot of people started a year or less ago after their friends talked them into joining.<BR>A lot of peoples mains are coming into the lower lvl planes now. There is no reason to buff up these places because there are a  lot of lvl 60s around. My best friend started when the game started. I remember watching him fight in runnyeye and being one of the high lvls on the server.<BR>I remember venturing into guk for the first time and being scared ****less because the area was relatively new to everyone. Should we make all zones that once had a mystique about them harder?<BR>At one point every zone was a new scary place and just because there are people who have gotten too powerful for a zone to be a challenge does mean we should make that zone harder.<BR> Heck my first raid was a Blackburrow "raid" with some friends and I was excited about going deep into Blackburrow.<BR>Should we make it so that all cool zones that once were elite places are now buffed because we want them to be a challenge for lvl 60s . No we should not.<BR>Once long long ago a Barbarian warrior wandered down the ramp from halas full of wonder and fought little gnolls  and slowly worked his way to Blackburrow and then got killed by a vengful soloist. Vengeful soloists are now an easy kill we must stop this madness!!!! These vengefuls once laid fear into the hearts of the greatest players on the server  now they are nothing and sometimes killed in one swing this must stop!!! WE must now make vengeful soloists lvl 75s that quad hit for 1200 this will fix the problem and strike fear back into the hearts of those who wander through everfrost without watching carefully for minions of evil.<BR>Ah the SSoY once a trtuely godly weapon droped off ferocious undead frogs is now soloable. Once there were guk raids heck there still are by lower lvl people. Because something is soloable or less difficult then it was before for people who have played longer does not mean we should punish lower lvl chars(Who ever thought you would call a lvl 50 a lower lvl char ugg) for not reaching 60 as fast by making something they have probably been looking forward to killing too hard to kill.<BR>This post is really long winded,but hey I really hate this idea, because it is stupid.<BR>With all the uber guilds on older servers the newer players have to struggle for form mid lvl groups and put to gether raids for stuff like naggy,vox,hate, and fear. There is no need to brinbg the uber guilds that are 30-100 people all lvl 55-60.<BR>I see what these guilds can do all the time.<BR>Uber guilds can take out a big monster in a matter of minutes with 1 or 2 deaths being considered getting owned. The other day my friends guild took out 2 big nasties(gore and wooshi I think) in under an hour. To these guilds adding PoF and Poh in once a week means an extra 1-4 hours out of the day getting phat loot.<BR>To the lower lvl guilds getting a chance to do soemthing they have looked forward to for a long time. It means learning the skills required in an effective raid against a "big nasty". For them its a nights work and a lot of collaboration and fun.<BR>Players who make it to 46 DESERVE to be able to try to kill a god. They have put the effort in and should get the same opportunities that the current lvl 55-60 players had when they were lower in lvl.<BR>I am not saying this for selfish reasons, my mains ability to go to PoF and PoH is unaffected by this change, but many people are jsut moving into this range and many people are hoping to go here some time in the near future. These people DESERVE to fight PoF and PoH as it is now.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>On a more serious note, I really hate the fact that every damn dungeon/Plane contains at least one mob that id pretty much impossible for the people of the appropriate level that normally hunt there to kill. That is BS.<P>No zone should contain any mob that is way beyond the means of the people who hunt it's ability to kill. No other game in the world is that way.<P>All video games seem to have a boss mob, but you kill it with the same character you used to do the whole rest of the game. AD&D always had some uber monster in the depths of the dungeon, but the same adventure party always could kill it (they did not have to round up 24 other AD&D players to come over).<P>I have just never seen Verants logic in putting one really powerful mob in each dungeon (since Kunark) that is geared just to the "uber crowd". Whats up with that, just make zones for those folks (which there already are) and put these mobs there.<P>Sticking a level 60-70 mob in a place hunted by players level 47-53 mostly is just spiteful and sick, what is wrong with letting those players actually accomplish something anyways? It makes people feel bad that they can clear an entire zone except for one mob, and know they have no chance of killing it. Geez, toss these folks a bone, on the shear luck that they may actually run into a god (which is damn rare with 3 month waiting lists to get inmto a plane) let them have a shot at killing him.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Both sides have very good arguments. Let's sum up shall we?<P>In favor of buffing Innoruuk/Cazic:<P>- From a roleplaying sense gods should be nigh-unkillable, con red to 60th level players, and so on.<P>- Gods should have well, "godlike" loot no? A buffed god would have buffed loot. This is good<P>- A little change, done well, can be good.<P>Opposed to buffing Innoruuk/Cazic:<P>- Epic quest items would have to be moved to a more accessible mob, or else the quests would become impossible for many more guilds than they are now or at the very least impact the risk/reward for these epics severely.<P>- These zones were designed for the 46-50 crowd. The 55-60 crowd has pretty much moved on. This is good. Buffing the gods will only encourage the uber guilds to come back to the old planes. This is bad because even if the "uber" guilds and the "casual" guilds don't butt heads, (in Fear for example the uber guilds will have to clear the zone before tackling CT, and clear at least some spawns in Hate) it still forces the casual guilds to walk in the uber guild's shadow, pick up loot from mobs they didn't kill, and basically forfeit the chance to make their own mistakes, learn how to handle the plane themselves, and so on. They basically LOSE THE CHANCE TO BE HEROES AND BECOME WELFARE CHILDREN. This is incredibly bad.<P>- A buffed Innoruuk/Cazic will be utterly unkillable for the typical "correct level" planar crowd. That means you have to put up with their habitual (and in CT's case, WAY too common) death touches with absolutely no recourse until the local uber guild comes and kills them. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>How about we just add a bit of creative story line?  <P>How about this, the actual gods had proxies made to discourage all but the most determined.  To give a taste of what they would have to face in the future were they ever to dare to kill the real gods?  <P>Leave the plains alone.  They're fine the way they are.  Make something up.  A portal that cannot be opened except with a key that is had from each of the proxies, that leads to the realms of the real gods or something?  <P>That would be a lot more reasonable, and it would give those of us who haven't had a chance to take on these plains our opportunity.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
