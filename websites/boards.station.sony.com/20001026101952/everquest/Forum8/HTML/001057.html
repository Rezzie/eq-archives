&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I've read numerous postings on numerous boards on the new racial armor. Being a long time smith I must say that when I saw the new plans for smithing updates I was elated that you guys were finally getting around to putting some really cool stuff into the trade skills. Then I found that all of the really cool higher end stuff was limited by race, and understandably got REALLY upset. Well, I'm still really upset, but maybe not for the same reasons as alot of others. Now keep in mind this is NOT a flame, these are real and I've thought a decent amount about alot of these points. If you disagree then explain intelligently, don't flame. Here are some of my observations and suggestions:<P>***Observations***<P>1) Since the start of the game, trade skills have been the one thing that have been open to all players. Didn't matter what race/class you were, you could put time and effort (and maybe a few practice points) into working on something that the majority of people didn't do. You could excel, regardless of class OR RACE in any chosen trade. *holds up hand* Now I know that some classes had a better time of it with certain trades.. ie. chanters and jewelcraft... however it WAS POSSIBLE to be a highly skilled jeweler.. you just had to have an enchanter friend or some such. I'm not saying that it was EASY to be any class/race/tradeskill combo.. just that it was possible. <P>some also might say.. well what about poison/tinkering/alchemy.. in response I say that those aren't true trade skills. those started out as being class/race specific and have always been accepted as such. As with poison and alchemy, those should be more attributed to class skills (like dual wield w/options or something... or maybe like 'track') than the standard trade skills. Tinkering? hey, those are gnomes.. nuff said ;p<P>In summation: Trade skills have, as of the past, been non race/class specific.<P>2) changing the non race/class based trade skills to a state of being race/class specific mid game is VERY frustrating to say the least. I will admit here.. I am a Wood Elf, and I chose smithing as my primary trade. I did NOT choose smithing because 'wow, I can make colored armor now' I have been a smith for many MANY months. When I first started playing EQ back when it first went commercial one of the first things I did was to start looking into smithing. I really started getting into it around lvl 20 or so when I actually could afford to practice it. Being a primary character at that level I couldn't throw a spare 1k pp at it.. I had to actually budget my money so that I could work at it, raising the skill as I went up in levels and income. I wanted to be able to make that next item, to be able be good at something alot of other people didn't want to take the time or resources to be good at.. it was something that helped define myself regardless of how many mobs I killed or how powerful my guild was.<P>Now.. in the back of my mind I was always hoping that someday that would put in an 'enchant ore' spell that some enchanter might get and maybe I could make a magical weapon.. or that there would be a logical progression and that they might add plate armor that I could craft. It was something that I actually kind of suspected later on in the game.. when there was more time to add such things.. you can imagine how happy I was to hear that there was colored armor on test, then that there was armor you could smith that actually had stat bonuses, etc. etc.<P>THEN!... THEN I find out that it is only if you are of a certain RACE that you can create such high end armor. Yes.. I can make the new plate.. that is GREAT. Don't get me wrong, I love that.. oh and to be able to color it (with help) is awesome as well.. so here I go first night of the patch I work all evening figuring out the plate recipe, running around finding the components till finally I make my first Fine Plate Collar! WOOHOO!<BR>I also find the Freeport Forge during this time, and decide to test this 'racial armor' thing out the next day... surely Verant wouldn't make it impossible for a high caliber smith such as myself to use a forge that I can 1) talk to an npc and find out HOW to use, and 2) get to, open and place items in.... would they?<BR>"you must be of the human race to use this forge".<P>In summation: The precedent for the way trade skills work, how they are viewed, what they are was changed in the wider scope of things... after having been established for well over a year.. which is VERY FRUSTRATING... VERY (the phrase 'words can't describe' comes to mind)<P>3) (trying to keep this one short) This borders on racial bigotry as presented ingame. ok.. maybe that's a bit harsh, however what would happen in real life if I refused to hire someone because of their race? That's what these are.. TRADE SKILLS.. they should NOT be racial. Anyone with enough drive, focus, and interest should be able to learn them. If I can't make a racial armor because that race won't teach it to me, then that incites hatred against that race, that leads to violence. So basically... does this allow me to declare war on other races in game? Guess what happens if I RP that... I get someone killed, then I get banned.<P>yes, this is a bit of a stretch but you have to admit it does have some logical merit. How many wars have been fought in the real world over technology that one race has that another wants?<P>4) If I really want to be able to smith some of the better armors now... basically I have to start a twink and work his smithing up... I know alot of people have a problem with this.. as do I (well not with twinking but starting a char just for his stats to powersmith/tailor/jewel/etc).. is this really how this game is supposed to be played.. is this part of the vision?<P>***Solutions***<P>1) Here's a simple one, allow smiths who have decided to specialize in smithing (ie obtain a skill of over 200) to use the racial forges. Now it COULD be that this is the case. This is a simple solution and may have been implemented.. I haven't achieved 201 yet so I don't know, however I kinda doubt it.<P>1a) you could throw a level minimum in there as well.. this would cut down on lvl 2 master smiths.<P><BR>2) Allow those races that do not have racial armor to do some type of quest gaining 'acknowledgement of their skill in the craft' with one of the races that do have the ability to craft such armor.<P>this leads us to my favorite solution...<P>3) Make the crafting of each racial armor (the use of each races forge) available to all.. HOWEVER make it difficult. (personally I have no problems with the difficulty of getting the components for the dyes, etc. hard is good.. it makes you work for it and gives you a better sense of achievement while weeding out the people that don't have dedication to the craft).<BR>I would suggest making each forge faction dependant as well as having some type of quest as stated in solution #2. Here's my idea:<P>Station a 'forge guard' by each forge who is very sensitive to racial faction. Make him around lvl 60 or so, so that in the first place you wouldn't even approach the forge unless you have ok faction with him (I'd say make him same faction as all the guards people so like to kill  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> but then that's a whole nother discussion)... then make it so that you have to be 'warmly' in his eyes before he lets you open the forge. Also.. once you are warmly, make it so that you can hail him and he will give you some type of quest (smithing oriented) that you must complete before you can use the forge. Now, from experience it is a PAIN to get to warmly from say.. indifferent (I did the squad ring quest in rivervale for some reason when I was lvl 20... I killed SO many goblins took several days)... then if the quest is of a decent level... well.. you get the gist of my idea I'm sure.<P>The thing here is that I believe (and yes that's an opinion) that if I spend a long part of my career working on something, perfecting a skill.. I shouldn't be prohibited from learning and taking that skill to the max that it has been taken to.. that is how progress is made.<BR>So what if I'm a wood elf.. if i want to learn the secrets of dwarven armor, I am going to do my best to ingratiate myself into their culture, get to know them, and I'm sure if I am persistent enough (may take a long time but still) I will eventually be able to learn their skills... if not well then I'm gonna kill every stinkin one of those short little twits I come across  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> j/k<P>**********************<P>couple other things I've seen:<P>'caster classes shouldn't be able to smith' - BS, there is much more to smithing than swinging a 50lb hammer, there are lots of other, smaller things involved.. ask any modern day Blacksmith (yes I know one in rl). smithing is a skill like any other, yes SOME str is required but that can be gained.<P>'well.. you haven't LOST any ability' - true, there is nothing that I can't make now that I couldn't always make before. however, being barred from something in my own trade is (like I said) very frustrating to say the least. It is also hard for someone who hasn't spent hours upon hours upon hours working on it to understand. This is not from the point of view of someone who has thrown a spare 5k at a secondary char 'so I can make my twink some armor'. If you haven't spent the time needed to work your primary char up in one of the major trades (the more difficult ones) for the reasons I stated above.. for the satisfaction you get from finally being able to make that special item with some regularity.. don't even pretend you know the level of frustration this causes.<P>'well it looks like you're just upset about smithing.. every race is going to get some special racial skill' - Ok yes, I will admit I am a bit biased when it comes to smithing.. however I feel the same about ALL the common trade skills. I think that if some human warrior has worked his fletching skill way up, because he had an affinity for the bow, than by all means he should be able to fletch any special arrows.. especially if he chose to specialize in fletching. What you are doing by saying that members of a race are only good at making such-and-such is classification.. that is what the CLASSES are for. these are basic trade skills, they should not be limited in such a manner.<P>*****************<P>to cap it all off.. what I'm trying to get across here is that it may not be easy for races to learn the skills and make the items of other races when it comes to trade skills.. but it SHOULD be POSSIBLE.<P>Brahma Faunafriend<BR>48 Wood Elf Druid <BR>Mithanial Marr<BR>smithing guide at http://www.eqbible.com</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I'm a dark elf necro who has been a master smith for at least a month before the upgrade was even announced. I remembered the day I heard that plate was going in. And then I saw cultural armor. WOOT! I guess I got lucky when I chose my race. But I did also think that it was slightly unfair to the races left out. Why ogres and not trolls? They don't even like each other... And half elves with dark elves? I think not. I can understand erudites, they are weak to begin with, but they are smart. I think a smart race can find a way to make a hammer hit some metal hard. All in all, I like the patch, but I'm not too sure about the cultural armor. I doubt that other races will ever get their own armor, and from one RP point of view, it makes sense. But it would be nice if everything was fair, if not equal.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Let's get to the real meat of the issue.  Most races get cultural smithing, which is very cool!  Wood elves get cultural fletching. :eek  This is unacceptable.  For several reasons <BR>1) In Gordon's words, "Archery will never be a viable means of melee combat."  What does this mean?  It means bows are useless.<BR>2) Let's say you do, for some strange reason, decide to use a bow.  Well you better be a ranger if you want anything better than a longbow.  In effect, this limits your potential market to RANGERS.<BR>3) A ranger without fletching is like a rogue without make poison.  It doesn't happen.<BR>Down to the facts here.  Most other races gets supercool armor.  Verant says tho, look, we know rangers suck so here we'll let your arrows do another 1 point of damage.  High elf chanters?  Well, ya already dominate jewellery but now why don't you sell your cultural armor to the two without, half elves and wood elves?<P>:mad I am very angry about this issue :mad<P>I will fight to get cultural armor added for wood elves.  This is not a dead issue.  Help me fellows, whatever your race.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>True, that's how alot of smiths feel (including me) about being left out of cultural armor.. however my main point here is that there should be racial exclusions in the trade skills (or at least common trade skills) PERIOD. At least not ones that can't be overcome. <P>and it goes the same for fletching... though you're gonna hit 95% of the people that fletch by making the racial fletching for welfs... you're still excluding the 5% of the warriors, etc. out there that might have picked it up and are into it.<P>racial restrictions on common trades skills is just WRONG. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>*sigh*<P>You are mixing two separate issues (1) The smithing expansion to plate armors and (2) the addition of cultural armors.<P>First:  The expansion<P>Every master smith can make and dye plate armor.  This is a significant expansion over what we could do before and provides a viable product for us to sell to mid to high level characters.<P>We can also make (almost) all the types of melee weapons in the game (by type I mean form - hammers, sword types, maces, daggers, etc.)  This is a substantial expansion over the limited four weapon types we could make before.<P>We can now forge components for use by fletchers in addition to the components we made which were useable by tailors.<P>Now, the cultural items:<P>Verant advertised early on that we would be able to make magical arms and armors.  They never came through with it, mostly because of game balance issues.  The cultural arms and armors are an attempt to deliver through on the promise while (1) expanding on the cultural feel of the game and (2) maintaining game balance.<P>The cultural arns armors are a serious pain to make and the magical ones are going to be even more of a pain.  The items are designed to be made only by characters working in conjunction with high level characters using expensive (and sometimes rare) components.  As such will only be able to be made when a server has aged significantly.<P>Finally on the cultural aspect: <P>Please explain to me why a high elf smith should expect to be able to make Dwarven Brellium Plate?  Why should a dwarven smith expect to make elven chain mail?  Why should a dwarven smith expect to be able to make the human cultural armors?  Each character has a racial component which carries implications.  This smithing expansion (and the tailoring expansion which will emphasize Erudites and Halflings) is just a new implication.<P>Yes, the cultural armors are "racially biased" it goes with the very definition.<P>If anything, I applaud Verant for trying to create more depth to the feel of the races in the game - personally I think that it adds to the feel of the RPG milieu they are trying to create.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Brahma_Faunafriend,<P>I got into the discussion of the new racially unbalanced trade skill changes when they were first announced, but dropped out because it seemed that nobody at Verant was listening.<P>I pretty much agree with most of the problems you pointed out.  Where I slightly diverge from you is in the solution. <P>Personally, I like Verant's idea of each race being able to make unique things that no other race can do.  But, unlike Verant, I think that each race should be able to make unique, high-end items in every trade skill, rather than being restricted to just excelling in one or two trade skills.<P>Rather than letting humans do a quest, earn faction, etc. to be able to make high-end dwarven items, I like the idea of letting humans make their own unique, high-end items that neither the dwarves nor any other non-human race can make.<P>So humans, erudites, wood elves, trolls, etc. would each have unique cultural items they could make in blacksmithing, in tailoring, in baking, and in all the other trade skills.<P>Here's my idea of how something like this could be set up:<P>(I'll use fletching as an example, since that is the one trade skill I was heavily involved in until the racial revamp wiped out my character's hopes.)<P><BR>Wood elves are small, fast, and live in the woods: their cultural fletching would produce bows and arrows that have moderately good range and damage, but exceptional rate of fire.<P>Humans aren't as fast, and much of their population (acording to the history in the EQ manual) lives in the plains of Karana.  So their cultural fletching might produce long range weapons with good damage and moderate rates of fire.<P>And, for a final example, Ogres: big, strong, but not very fast or very dextrous.  I could see Ogre fletchers producing very powerful cultural bows that used very heavy arrows to do exceptional damage, but had only average range and a slow rate of fire.<P>Similar ideas could be developed for all races with all trade skills.<P>For example, the Erudites aren't particulary noted for strength, so their advanced cultural blacksmithing might center on producing magical armor and weapons.  Erudite smithing might produces items like a plate helm that would allow the wearer to see perfectly at night, to see invisible creatures, and also to breath underwater.<P><BR>If the idea of each race being restricted to excelling in just a few trade skills had been build into the game from the very beginning, I think that would have been fine: just one more factor in chosing what race and class to play and what (if any) trade skills to get involved in.<P>But trying to add in racial imbalances now, after people have been playing a building up their characters, is a pretty raw deal in my opinion.<P>Many of us have put a lot of time and effort into role-playing our characters as craftsmen, and now Verant is telling us that we're permanently condemmed to being just second raters, because we chose a race/trade combination that they've decided is inferior.<P>So I really do hope Verant will reconsider, and restore the old racial balance in trade skills instead of giving such a rotten deal to so many of the role-players.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Forin_Ironshield---<P>first, thanks for the reply... you make alot of sense. The idea that there are 2 issues here.. one of increased ability as a smith, and the other as cultural armor being something else entirely do make some sense though it doesn't make it any less frustrating.<P>as far as the:<P>"Please explain to me why a high elf smith should expect to be able to make Dwarven Brellium Plate? Why should a dwarven smith expect to make elven chain mail? Why should a dwarven smith expect to be able to make the human cultural armors? Each character has a racial component which carries implications. This smithing expansion (and the tailoring expansion which will emphasize Erudites and Halflings) is just a new implication."<P>thing goes... can you tell me why I SHOULDN'T expect to be able to make something? givin the<BR>interest and the drive needed to learn how? These are, once again, TRADE skills.<BR>I will give you that it might not be as likely for an elf to make dwarven armor.. but<BR>what of a wood elf to make high elf armor? a half elf to make human or elven armor? a dwarf<BR>to make ogre armor? And what IF a wood elf decides to spend many days and nights, years even laboring under the eyes of a fine dwarven smith.... what would stop him from learning their secrets and abilities?<P>oh.. and one last thing..<P>"Verant advertised early on that we would be able to make magical arms and armors. They never came<BR>through with it, mostly because of game balance issues. The cultural arms and armors are an attempt to deliver through on the promise while (1) expanding on the cultural feel of the game and (2) maintaining game balance."<P>so where are the new magical arms and armor I can make (and no, arrow parts don't cut it, I don't care HOW you argue it)? I don't remember any notations on the box that said "oh.. btw, if you ever want to smith any of the really cool armor that we will put in the game at a later date, don't start a wood elf, troll, halfling, etc."<P>DinkumThinkum---<P>good points and very good ideas... you illustrate my point... being someone who would like to take fletching further... and yes... if verant will eventually put something special in for every race and every trade skill.. great! We shall wait and see what happens.<P>personally.. I like the idea of a wood laminate, or maybe mithril imbued wood armor for wood elf plate.. <P>I still think that the racial bias going on with the trade skills is wrong, but somehow doubt anyone at verant will ever agree.. so I'll just have to satisfy my smithing interests with my high elf chanter twink *sigh*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum8&number=8&thisthread=001057&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum8&number=8&thisthread=001057&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
