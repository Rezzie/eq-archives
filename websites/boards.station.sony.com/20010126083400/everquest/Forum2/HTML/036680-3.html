</FONT><HR>I don't care about those 2 issues. I do care about game longevity. I want positive reinforcement, NOT negative. It's the easiest thing in the world to come up negative/destructive methods to solve a problem---very easy. What's difficult is to come up with positive methods. It requires some creavtive action. It requires more in-depth thinking.<P>That's my issue. Stop the negative.

What is the worst that can happen you wander in and get killed by a dragon? Okay, you go back and drag your own corpse. No, you won't aggro everyone in the zone on you, or even anyone nearby if they arn't already aggroed. Read the post. If worse comes to worse, get an invis and drag it to a safe spot. I'm sorry, but this isn't near as bad as you people say it is.

Firstly, it's not a change at all, since it's only for the new content (though I'm not ruling out the use of this concept in other places later on).  I hope you were not looking for more content that requires the exact same tactics as the old content.  That would be a waste of our time and your money.  That's certainly not our intent.  As for it being huge, that's an exaggeration.  It was possible for us to create zones like those you've seen, where everything is willing to attack everyone.  But we wanted to allow for some new types of content, and this is one way to do it without invalidating that content by use of a simple /corpse command.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Exaggeration, yes, True, a bit over the top was my answer, however Let me explain a little in- game math to you.<P>It takes me 4 hours soloing with almost NO downtime, slaughtering Hill giants to make 1k pp, that "Large amount of plat" can be used in less than an hour in a sky plane raid, in coffins alone, Not to mention the cost of the items just to get to the planes.<P>So you spend an absolute ton of time and money and get to go to 3 planes/inner dungeon raids, now your strapped for cash, and are stuck in a vicious cycle.<P>Also, I assume the area's you are talking about will be of the difficulty of the planes at least, so the afformentioned problem still exists.<P>Verant decided to nerf the cash drops all over the game, and cash is ludicrously difficult to get now. Not to even mention the fact that you are expanding the trade skills into something that people may actually want to explore as well, and these are also unreal expensive. 1.5k pp will get you to about skill 40 to 50 in alchemy, not to mention, black smithing and other endevours.<P>My point mainly is, why is the game always about TAKE, TAKE, TAKE, from the ingame players, and when there is something decent available to them, make it ineffective all the time.<P>There comes a point where the only things that are effective anymore are what I would consider to be exploits, and we are forced to do them just because the BS mounds have blocked all other options.<P>If you want a prime example of this, just remember the 250 corpses that used to be outside of Sebilis, and you will see what I mean.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Having an NPC attack anyone who drags a corpse by them is not good AI. <P>This feature isn't really based on faction. It's based on dragging corpses. From what I understand..from what I read of Absor..doesn't matter what killed the person and created the corpse.

</FONT><HR>I am not complaining at all, I was just after more more detail.  Its not too much to ask to have a detailed explanation to a game system 2 years old.<P>And in my Freeport example its a clear case that you can die next to a mob which doesnt like you even if you are tolerated in the city/zone by almost everything.<P>Now what if your a class without invisibilty?  You get someone to move your corpse.  Its not that simple anymore.<P>Absor posted:<P>"Dragging a corpse will not make you more visible. So if the creature sees through invis, it will still see you dragging a corpse. If it does not, dragging a corpse will not increase your visibility to that creature."<P>Okay, this is the way I think invisibility/hiding works with hate lists, if I am correct then this minor change may have a major impact in being able to CR.  Here is the way I believe it to work at present, please correct me if I am wrong:<P>Being invisible/hiden prevents you from becoming visible to a mob and prevents you going on a mobs agro list.  It does not do anything for you if your already on the mobs hate list.<P>If you dont believe me agro a mob and gate away somewhere within the zone and then put invisibilty or hide and go within agro distance of the mob, it will come straight for you.  Going invisible/hiding doesnt remove you from their hate list.<P>I've been invisible and had mobs that have run away (but still on their hate list) come back and attack me even though I was invisible to them.<P>Now if you start to drag someone and you are added to the mobs hate list they will come straight after you, visible or not.  Once you agro a mob it doesnt mater if your invisible or not as far as I am aware.<P>I may not be correct, but from my playing that has been my observation as how it works.  If I agro something nasty I zone out to take me off the hate list since I've been attacked whilst invisible before.  Maybe I just had bad experiences with the old invisibilty bug. *shrug*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>rober135: Why does the game always take take take from the players?<P>NOBODY forces you to buy Velious.  If you don't like it, don't buy it.  Kunark doesn't have the same rules nor does Antonica nor Odus nor Faydwer.  <P>I am getting truly disappointed by the amount of players here that have no idea of what the heck they are talking about.  Get a clue guys before you whine and maybe Verant will listen to you more instead of the "join the bandwagon and bash Verant" sort of thing you're all running here.  Velious CR is different because Verant implemented a faction thing , meaning instead of like VP where EVERYONE is KOS , you have high level uber dungeons where the right players can walk in and take a stroll among the great dragons and chat with them even.  There is a HUGE amount of exploit associated with that and I'd be pissed if Verant DIDN'T implement anything to stop it.<P>For those newbies who doesn't have a clue about high level dungeons - YES you do have to have a necro to summon your corpse and YES a CR at higher levels does take a load of time.  Go to a failed Trak raid or VS raid or VP raid or Fear raid or Hate raid or Sky raid and you WILL know what I am talking about.  This is nothing new, and as Velious is a 35-60 continent it is only LOGICAL that it follows the same rules as high level dungeons instead of being a low level playground like BB where players can go in and uber-camp it like they do lower guk or even sebilis nowadays.<P>I can't believe what most people are saying here.  Why does Verant make the game difficult? Why not make it so every zone is Blackburrow and players can solo every mob in the game including dragons and gods? Well guess what, if they did that 90% of the players would stop playing in a couple of monthes.  There is no value to powerful magical items if you did not work for it.  "Hey look at me, I got these uber armor items that dropped off of moss snakes.  Whooppeee!" Everyone remember Diablo1? The reason why most people quit Diablo1 is because they couldn't stand the cheating and exploiting that was all over the place and the ease of getting uber-dung and the challenge that was no longer there.<P>Yes, Velious is going to be difficult.  Yes it's gonna be annoying and frustrating at times, but in the end, as some guy in Legacy of Steel webpage mentioned: "There are moments in Veeshan's Peak that just makes you want to tear your hair off and quit playing forever, but once you become skilled at the zone, it becomes a playground for dragon hunting".<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I personally don't like this way of handling corpse dragging at all. And I am further disturbed at the hint that the concept may be extended to older zones. It is not uncommon that people die in bad places and require non-KoS  friends to drag their corpse. It happens in very common places like cities and NPC camps all over the world.<P>Getting a corpse summoned happens to be far more difficult than getting a res because of cost and logistics of getting a necro and coffin and all to the right zone. Summoning corpses is and should remain an expensive and diffucult last resort to getting your stuff back. It should not be made a necessity and commonplace event for people of all levels.<P>People are far less willing to help others when there is high risk of death involved. This kind of KoS policy while dragging will definately increase that risk of death for what has traditionally been a safe way for people to help each other out after something has gone bad.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, heres my take on it. <P>VI wants to add another way to lose exp/items. Ok, fine I can understand that. But... It seems like this was a hasty descicion and I certainly feel we will see some changes to this. <P> But that aside, I think that with the corpse dragging deaths as is. The necro summon corpse spell should drop in velious somewhere or be able to be bought and the component price changed. <P> Its just rediculous how hard it is to get the lvl 39 summon corpse spell. 150pp for the component and costs 700 mana is outrageous.  <P>Lets consider the cleric. The cleris is essencially the necromancers counterpart in many ways. <P>Cleric gets Resuscitate at lvl 39 (same lvl as necro summon corpse spell). The clerics spell sommons the players body to his corpse (basically a interzone reverse sommon corpse in addition to 50% exp recovery). The cleric spell requires no component. The clerics spell can be bought at almost any cleric guild for 20pp and only costs 500 mana.<P> To get the summon corpse spell a necro has two options.<P>Option #1 Pay 1k-2kpp to buy it from a player IF you can find someone selling it.<P>Option #2 get a group of lvl 40's to camp a 36hr spawn who MIGHT drop this spell.<P>Please explain how making this spell so hard to get and then creating its usefulness in anyway gives balance to the game?

</FONT><HR>I personally believe this is ridiculous.  I just don't know another word for it.  Hmm - how about unreasonable.  <P>What if a bunch of NPCs that neither or nor my friend are KoS to watch me us die from a DoT spell or something, then my friend drags me to a nearby cleric for a rez - will my friend be aggroed by all those surrounding him? <P>That just doesn't make *ANY* sense.  None.  Unless somehow the residents of Velious see corpse dragging of friends a crime or something.  I think it's a bug - it doesn't work like it's supposed to (according to any reasonable explanation anyone can provide).  I realize I'm probably jumping the gun here - with 1000 other people flaming at the same time, but this concept is POORLY THOUGHT OUT and NEEDS MODIFICATION.  <P>If dragging is a big problem for NPCs (because the faction of the parent player isn't checked - it's just the fact that it's a corpse - which is borderline retarded), wouldn't *REZZING* a corpse be a huge violation of the NPC ethics code?  IE - NPCs should attack someone rezzing a corpse, correct?  What about healing another player?  <P>Why not just make everything in Velious KoS to everyone?  That way, your stupid corpse faction bull-poo system will make sense and nobody will complain.  <P><BR>GM_Flunkie_01 tells you, "We are sorry you have a problem with the new corpse faction problems ... err... I mean feature... Just remember you don't *NEED* to go to Velious.  Nobody put you on the boat and said come here and deal with our new failure at programming... err ... I mean expansion pack.  Thank you for your support.  Bye."<P>/sigh verant</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>They haven't said it would be EVERY zone in Velious. What if it just ends up being the city zones... the dwarf city, the giant city, and the dragon city? If you are not KOS and die there, you don't have any problem with corpse recovery, so getting someone to drag your corpse isn't necessary. If you are KOS there, you have to get your corpse out of a KOS zone, which is no different than most dungeons. The corpse dragging change is just so that people not KOS can't drag it out for you. Most CRs aren't done this way anyway (Most rogues/necros/whoever are KOS by the monsters that killed the original player, at least in most dungeons/planes), so I don't see why people are upset. If the giants were KOS to everyone, and you died halfway through, how would you get your corpse back? All they are doing is fixing an exploit (using a faction mule to retrieve corpses) before it becomes an exploit, which is far better than them letting it get established and THEN fixing it, which they tend to do.<P>tjh<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036680-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036680.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036680-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036680-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=036680&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=036680&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
