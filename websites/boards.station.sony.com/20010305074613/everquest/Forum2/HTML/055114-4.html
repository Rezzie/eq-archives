</FONT><HR>EVADE:  Please fix it so that if it says "You duck out of combat" you actually duck out of combat.<P>HIDE while moving:  I, like many rogues, hit sneak and hide at just about the same time.  Due to latency, I will often see "You must stand perfectly still to hide!"  Even though I have stopped and done the little caster trick of turning a little.  Ideally, make HIDE make you invisible and automatically start sneaking.  Make sneak/hide useable underwater.<P>EVADE:  When I get hit while trying to evade, it will "move" me (knock me back I assume), and I fail (You can't hide while moving!).  This wouldn't be a problem if the internet didn't have lag.  How am I supposed to time evading based on the NPC hitting me, when when I hear/see it hitting me isn't the same time the server sees me getting hit?  Making HIDE an invisible key would probably fix this.<P>ESCAPE:  Please give rogues something to escape with... Instill Doubt is worthless until about 38, and even then it is by far the most worthless of the "escape" abilities (FD, shadow step, fear spell, 10 sec invul).<P>POISONS:  I personally don't like poisons at all (or use them), for many of the reasons listed (price/stack/ad infinitum).  I would rather backstab just do more damage and take away poison.<P>TRACKING:  Please give rogues tracking.  Evil races need trackers.  PvP teams servers need evil trackers.  Open any roleplaying book on rogues and look up the "scout" rogue.  Give us tracking please.<P>Complaints:  Rogues do not come into their own until almost level 40.  If I didn't have an SK and rich enchanter friend giving me all their hand-me-downs and extra money, I would never have made it from levels 10 to 35.  I do not know what the answer is, but please consider doing something to make the lower-mid levels more enjoyable for rogues.  The addition of an escape ability/tracking would probably make rogues much more wanted in teams at the lower levels.  Even practically twinked, I never did as much damage as the warrior/hybrid types until much later in life.  For a while, it even seemed that I was only aggroing more, rather than doing more damage. <P>WISH:  <BR>* Increase the range at which rogues start moving faster while sneaking.<P>* Give rogues a "sprint" ability to run faster for a short period of time.  Give it a bit of a reset time, so that it can be used to flee but is not better than any of the travelling spells (sow/jboots/etc).<P>* If rogues are supposed to be the damagers of the melee world, increase the damage they do earlier in life.  As young ones, we're basically mediocre warriors with wizard hps.<P>* Increase rogue hps.<P><BR>Thanks.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have now ran a rogue to 35th level - and here are my issues / ideas:<P>1. Poison making needs attention. <P>I run a 55th level Shaman and have it made so easy with regards to alchemy it shocked and dismayed me how hard and expensive it is for rogues to make poison. I simply do not understand the disparity - shaman have no pottery requirement - all their componets can be commonly bought and the effects are great and desireable. I can easily make 500pp to1000pp profit in a 4 hour session selling stacked SOW potions. Rogues - as everyone hre knows (1) Must gather dropped componets (2) Make (recently changed) or Buy Vials - AND have skins for lining (simply ridiculous) and wost of all (3) you need a skill to apply them. <BR>I gave up on poisons out of pure frustration. <P>I reccomend the following:<P>1. Make all componets purchasable. <BR>2. Abandon the requirements of vials - if shamen do not need them - why us?<BR>3. Abandon Apply Posion Skill.  - Let us sell them like Shamen can let all classes use them - but give a faction hit for those race/religion classes that disapprove. i.e... the prime healer has taken note of your foul use of poisons..... <BR>4. Let us stack them like shamen can with a toxicology kit of some sort.<P>More ideas...<P>1. How about a discipline for "Assisnation"... a critical blow that does a X variable % of total MOB hit points (20% to 80%) from being assasinated.  yeah, yeah... it will be rare hard to use and not availbale till level 50 - think of it as comsenurate with a harm touch of sorts...<P>2. How about a new skill called "disguise" this would work like a full blown illussion spell but would allow a rogue to select an opponet and activate the skill to make him or herself a duplicate of that mob. i.e... I am in lower guk and sneaking along. I see a froglock ... I select it and hit the disguise skill. As I appear from hiding I look like a froglock. Our faction in disguise would be just to edge of beta-neutral - to allow infilration.  This would make us TRULY scouts. This skill would come in at level 20 or so. <P>3. another skill maybe "running or sprinting"... called "Fast Break". This would be a sort of a short term skill based (SOW) 50% to 75% burst of speed for 10 to 30 seconds to allow us to run away from the bad guys... or the good guys as it goes. <P>Other than that... I like the rogue. <P>Cheers<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bugs:<BR>1) Hide does not overwrite invs/invs versus undead.<P>Effect: Since hide does not overwrite invs spell, when invs where off hide gets broken.<P>2) Sneak/hide speed increases - Between level 50 and 60 we start moving faster while we are sneaking. Unfortunatly these increases are limited to forwards. We still sneak just as fast while backing up. Oversite or intent?<P>3) Hide breaking - there are several instances when hide will break, but the button remains greyed out. Not informing the user that hide has failed. One is when trading with a merchant, the other is when passing an item to an npc. Although most Rogues realize this, they probably learned this through a death or doing research outside the game.<P>4) Instil Doubt - When this skill is used successfully, BS shows as an available skill. Unfortunatly it is not an available skill, and the user needs to make an estimate as to when the skill is truely available.<P>5) Apply poisen - Apply poisen makes a rogue auto sit during the process, however he does not auto stand up after a successfull apply (like bind wounds)<P>6) Sneak/hide on ld, zone, logout. I don't think the stability of VI's internet connection should be a risk factor, for Rogues on CR, it currently is. We don't have an escape skill, when this happens we train or die. As a side benefit if scouting is one of our roles, making sneak/hide last in these situation would certainly help us do our job.<P>7) Poisens - Are they going up against just poisen resistance on NPC's or others. Could you double check?<P>Desired Enhancements:<BR>1) Make sneak hide speed increases start earlier and max sooner. It would not add any unbalancing factors to the game.   <P>2) Throwing - Rogues are given a choice of using bows or throwing weapons. For roleplay reasons many rogues prefer throwing weapons. The range of throwing weapons how ever does not compliment our method of pulling very well. I would like the range of throwing to be modified by the skill of the rogue. With the end result somewhere in the 150 range from a base throwing range weapon of 75. It would make the desision easier. Nothing says stealth like a Gnome wielding a 4 foot tall bow.<BR>3) Dex/AGI - Currently these are listed as primary stats for Rogues in the character creation screen. With the learning curve for Rogues being more based upon Dex, this came a little closer to being true. With the primary role of a rogue being damadge from level 50+, STR and STA are the most important stats. The benefits from agility decrease rapidly over 150 regarding AC. The benefits to our defensive skills from dex/agi are not noticable from parsing log files. The chances of a level 50+ rogue soloing anything blue even with the best items in the game are very slim. If defensive skills were more dependant upon dex, it would have no impact on balance. For tanking our abilities are around an enchanters pet of the same level.<P>4) Escape skill - many Rogues will mention that an escape skill would be nice. Unfortunatly most of these solutions could cause problems like the unintented use of FD. In revisting the last subject again, I think something that would not tip the scale to much would be a slight speed increase based upon level and agility/dex. With maybe the maximum speed increase being less then the difference between lvl 50 sow and jboots. Yet not stacking with Sow.<P>5) Bind wounds - At level 60 Rogues get the same bind skill enhancements of warriors and monks. If we had this skill at level 51 it would not allow us to solo. As we have zero ability to kill blues anyways. It would be a group beneficial skill and a monk beneficial skill. Being able to sneak into a dangerous area and bind wound a monk up enough for them to check agro would speed things up for everyone.<P>6) Stackable poisens - If possible the only advantage this would add to rogues is, space in thier inventory. We can only use one at a time and application causes us to sit and takes 10seconds. I don't see how making them stack would add any new functionality.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>In no particular order, the short-and-sweet version:<P>(1) Click to remove illusions on command (enchanters should like this, too).<P>(2) When looting/trading/etc and Hide is broken, un-gray the button and TELL us.<P>(3) When we get a successful backstab, gray out the Instill Doubt button until we can use it again and when we get a successful Instill Doubt, gray out the backstab button until we can use IT again.<P>(4) Make poison components cheaper/easier to get (I'd like stacking, but realize that's 'impossible'... in any event, poison will likely always be the equivalent of the Mage 'spinning bottle' spell...) <P>(5) Increase range on throwing weapons and elimate "too close to use ranged weapons"<P>(6) Make Sneak/Hide last across zone boundaries, linkdeath and camping.<P>I've read how #6 cannot be done because Sneak/Hide is not a "buff" but a skill.... how hard would it be to MAKE it a buff? JBoots "cast" a buff instantly --- even while moving --- and JBoots effect lasts through zoning, linkdeath and camping. <P>Use whatever code you use for JBoots, except it has the normal recycle time. I saw an orc in Crushbone (Royal Guard, I believe he was) ~cast~ a spell and turn invisible. First time I'd seen a monster do that (dark elf here, don't hunt Crushbone  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> ) but a friend told me that was just the way the game handled NPC rogues 'hiding'. <P>Activating the sneak 'buff' (there would need to be one for each skill) would take no time to 'cast' and could be done on the move --- just like JBoots. If you were ALREADY sneaking, then when you pushed the sneak buff-button you would 'break' sneak (as happens when you press the sneak button while sneaking NOW). Then you could press the sneak buff-button again and 'cast' on yourself again. Clearly, it would be BEST if there were no visible or audible components to this spell (esp so PvP can't hear us going invis)....<P>Hide would be slightly different in that it would require you to not be moving in order to 'cast'.<P>There are some problems with this, of course:<P>(a) cannot 'cast' on boats --- but you can sneak/hide on boats.<P>(b) number of buffs --- could be a problem at higher levels, if you get a ton of buffs put on you.<P>Just grasping at straws, here.... this is the ONE thing that rogues would really appreciate. Almost as much as when you could actually sneak AND hide at the same time! (who remembers having to STOP sneaking and hide quickly before you were seen, then wait for the monster to go away before you started moving again?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> )<P>As for Evade... I'll reserve judgement. I've never had a monster rush halfway across the zone to fight someone, and I've OFTEN had it "succeed" and still get my teeth hammered in...<P>BraxZana D'Vex &lt;Arbiters&gt;<BR>51st Lv Natural Teir'Dal Rake<BR>Eci<P>PS: The ad banner, or something, keeps diverting me to another site WHILE I'm typing this post --- quite irritating to have to go 'back' all the time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>If you're gonna mess with my evade at least make it more reliable. I've got maxed hiding for my lvl, 52, and evade fails quite a bit.... and *sometimes* you're still #1 on the hate list even after a successfuly evade.<P><BR>Poison: Screw poison, this game was designed around us not having it...we cant expect it to be any better in EverQuest and still be balanced....maybe EQ2, but not EQ. It was a good try though.<P>Instill Doubt: Personally, i'd like to see instill doubt be usefull. I've got the skill maxed, and it's useless. Besides the a) distance to target check,  b) skill check, c) kick hitting target check, d) resist check, and e) if it lands, it usually lasts a few seconds. <P>Instill Doubt could be a nice skill if it a) was at least semi-reliable, and b) was like the second version of the screaming terror spell(read: fear and forget/all or nothing effect) so we could use it when our group is in trouble, to get rid of a mob or two *semi-safely* (if we fail instill, it is a taunt and the rogue will get whooped on, but if it works, one less mob to worry about). Would probably need a longer reuse time however.<P>Pick Locks: Works fine<P>Detect/Disarm Traps: ehh.... better than i ever expected it to be so can't complain (they're actually implemented!)<P>Disarm: It's fine...plus it'd be to big a change to EQ to make weapons affect NPC melee dmg (minus pets), and it's fun for duels.<P>Hide: Can't hide underwater unless you are sitting motionless at the floor of the ocean/lake/etc. Doesn't really make sense.... it's the whole "cannot hide while moving" thing... being in water makes it impossible to stop moving unless you're parked treading water on the ground.<P>That's it. If you're messing with evade at all, look at instill doubt. That is probably the one skill with the most potential but currently has the least usefulness.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>What is the point of getting better at sneak and hide when the only difference it makes is whether you fail or not. As it stands now, after you attain master at hide and sneak around 100 or so it never really fails that often anyway. <P>I think its great that you get better at these skills, but the fact that you are better should be reflected in the game. Example: you get better at sneak, so you can sneak faster. <P>Was in sol b for a while last night and hide didn't work there-this must be some kind of mistake or bug that needs to be fixed. I can see perhaps not being able to sneak past a highly intelligent dragon or something, but COME ON, you can't seriously think that a rogue with master ability in hide and sneak can't sneak past a stupid kobold or bat???</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oops accidently hit new topic rather than reply.<P>As a player who left early post-Beta I have to say that Rogues are fine as they are. I don't believe we need any new skills or disciplines or anything like that.<BR>I would like to see 2 small changes made that are more on the role playing aspect of what a rogue is.<P>1) Pickpocket capped at 46 lvl. This cap was pre-kunark and was not looked at after the lvl cap went from 50 to 60. Please increase the cap to 56. Not having a prime role defining Rogue skill (even though its not combat related) available from 46 to lvls 60 seems excessive. <P>The only objections I can see is that mobs post 46 have spells on them and the solution to this would be to make the spell scrolls magical (which kinda makes sense to me anyways)<P>2) Make the all vendor sold throwing weapons stack (ie throwing axes, javelins etc.) The forged throwing axes and javelins where changed so that they stack so the vendors should be too. <P>This would make throwing more appealing to the rogue class rather than archery and break a little bit of the homogenous nature of pullers.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>What is the point of getting better at sneak and hide when the only difference it makes is whether you fail or not. As it stands now, after you attain master at hide and sneak around 100 or so it never really fails that often anyway. <P>I think its great that you get better at these skills, but the fact that you are better should be reflected in the game. Example: you get better at sneak, so you can sneak faster. <P>Was in sol b for a while last night and hide didn't work there-this must be some kind of mistake or bug that needs to be fixed. I can see perhaps not being able to sneak past a highly intelligent dragon or something, but COME ON, you can't seriously think that a rogue with master ability in hide and sneak can't sneak past a stupid kobold or bat???</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

But since we cant pickpocket any mobs 45+, and most of the mobs we fight at lvls 50+ are pracitcally always 45+, we can't raise our pick pocket skill.

</FONT><HR>When sneak/hide was fixed so that it no longer breaks when a spell is cast by a PC or bard on the rogue the last major rogue concern was addressed.  I think rogues sit very well in the range of balance.  There are several classes that are much MORE necessary and needed for a group than a rogue, so they are by no means too powerful.  Rogues still fill in one of the "extra" slots of a group in most situations - the main exception being when lock picking is required.  Granted the high damage output might make them one of the more desired "extras" at times, but this is offset by the lack of defense and utility.<P>Again, rogues are just about perfect now.  They serve a niche function and do it well.  The only things I would like to see are things which do not really change balance regarding other classes at all and are really just convenience factors:<P>1.  Quested soul bound lock picks.<BR>2.  Stacked poison.<BR>3.  Sneak speed increasing at a lower level (maybe starting at skill 150+ and still achieving full speed at level 60).<BR>4.  Sneak/hide becoming persistant when zoning.<BR>5.  Up the range just a little bit for the knives summoned with the mrylokar bracer.<BR>6.  Allow illusions to be removed by clicking.<P>I don't think that any of these suggestions would detract from any other class or make the rogue more desired over other classes in groups in any way whatsoever, but would be of great benefit to rogues for personal use.<P>I would also be 100% satisfied if no changes were made to rogues at all.  We are doing well, and yet we are not overpowered at all.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My Suggestions:<P>Effect for Burning Rapier: I loved doing the quest for this weapon, as it was a "quest" and not a "camp", but where is the "burning" part of the rapier? Could you look into getting it a flame effect or some type of particle effect. How about you make the Rapier a reddish color with a lite particle effect (steam?)<P>Poisons: The better you get at making poisons how about giving the rogue slightly higher poison resist, say 1 point to their PR every 10 points in apply poison? Also how about giving the option to apply poison on ranged weapons? It would make sense from a roleplay point of view for rogue to coat the point of an arrow with poison.<P>Low Level Tracking: I liked this idea and never thought of it myself, often times when I am hunting a specific mob I have to call in a Ranger to lend a hand in finding them. Rogues are assassins aren't they, why can't we track someone down?<P>Disarm: Since the disarm skill doesn't work and is not that useful how about giving it a stun effect as well, If I knock a weapon out of your hand it is going to startle you and may cause you to become disoriented.<P>Gnome Rogues: Can you pleaaaaase take a look at the posibility of Gnome Rogues being able to wear the watchman armor? When I first heard about it I was dying to find out if I could wear it, you can imagine my disapointment when I couldn't. Gnome Rogues have it hard, we should atleast be able to make ourselves some armor from our Gnome heritage.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Other than these suggestions I think the Rogues are balanced.<P>Samick McKenzie<BR>lvl 28 Gnome Rogue<BR>Tinkerer For Hire<BR>Bertoxx</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>First of all, thanks for listening. Here are my suggestions, and believe it or not - I held back  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P><BR>* Stackable poison<P>* Price review on poison<P>* Mortar and pestle to be able to go in a backpack (major coding problem I know)<P>* Change so poison procs on backstab/frontstab instead of first pierce<P>* Sneak/hide status saved just as invis when logging, LD, zoning etc (some more hard programming, I know this wasn't done for game balance reasons)<P>* Hide should untarget player from duelling player<P>* Circlet of shadows enables shadowknights and necromancers to invis while running, remove the "you have to stand still to be able to hide" requirement for rogues?<P>* Rangers can channel through Jolt whereas rogues gets insta-interrupted from a hit (this is bad when it's lagging), remove the "you have to stand still to be able to hide" requirement for rogues?<P>* Sneak speed in reverse, strafing and swimming is unmodified level 51+, is this by design?<P>* Evade success rate dependant on AGI?<P>* Double attack, double backstab and dual wield success rate modified by DEX?<P>* Much, much faster recycle on sense traps (1 second or so)<P>* If "target is out of range" = instant refresh of backstab / kick / flying kick etc<P>* Backstab skill cap the same as flying kick cap for monks<P>* Range increase for monks and rogues with throwing weapons<P>* Deadly strike = Assassination (same rules of course)<P>* Soulbound lockpicks<P>* Compare pure melee ATK rating to a self buffed ranger at 60 (Add natural ATK bonus to pure melees). With 255 strength, a rogue with epic will have 1235 ATK whereas a ranger with epic will have close to 1400 with epics and self buffs. Suggestion: buff natural ATK for pure melee classes by 3 per level<P>* Compare pure melee block/dodge discipline duration to rangers parry discipline. Suggestion: buff pure melee to 20 sec too (shorter recycle time but same duration so pure melees come out on top)<P>* Reset discipline timer upon death (in the same fashion as Lay hands and Harm touch)<P>Tank ability should be:<P>#1 Warrior<BR>#2 Paladin<BR>#3 Sk<BR>#4 (not too far from Sk) Monk<BR>#5 Rogue<BR>#6 Ranger (not too far behind rogues. perhaps rogues have too high defensive capabilities. i don't know - check it. items such as the high ac shoulders from the Hole which rangers but not rogues can wear would have to be reexamined though)<P>Damage dealing from the front should be:<P>#1 Monk<BR>#2 Warrior/Rogue<BR>#3 Ranger (should equal Warrior damage IF they use spells)<BR>#4 Sk<BR>#5 Paladin<P>Damage dealing from behind the mob:<P>#1 Rogue<BR>#2 Monk<BR>#3 Warrior<BR>#4 Ranger<BR>#5 Sk<BR>#6 Paladin<P>Given equal level equipment and the same level of the char - these tables should be true at all times, no fluke rounds should throw a warrior above monks in damage and bad luck on backstabbing shouldn't throw off rogue damage to be lower than a monks from behind. This needs to be tested and rebalanced on green conning creatures as well as red cons with high/low ac. Also, the gap between rogues and monks from behind the mob needs to be greater than the gap between monks and rogues from the front due to the special condition factor (ie to account for caster playing ping pong with critters, when pets have Velketor pressed against the wall, trying to circle Nexona when you are snared by the AE etc).<P>I could discuss all those points in detail and what they mean for game balance and what the changes would mean to game balance and for other classes; just ask =)<P>Lastly:<P>Assassination - thank you very much. I have been level 60 for 4 months and I still laugh when it goes off.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Couple o' things:<P>1) Evade does NOT currently make you "virtually" immune to high level mobs. Hardly. I have been killed by critters that I have successfully evaded. They chased me, as they were not rooted I was not at low health when they went nuts on me. It just happens sometimes. And in a multi-mob situation, when crowd control just isn't up to snuff... rogues EASILY get slaughtered. Evade was the skill that saved the rogue class, but it's not the magical uber-skill some people think it to be. <P>2) Rogues aren't tanks, IMHO. As much as I'd love to see warrior-quality armor, resists, and hitpoints, it's just not appropriate. Rogues are, however, tank-dependent. Make sure we can continue to work WELL with other tanks, and our skills complement theirs.<P>3) I think, post-50, rogues are quite well balanced. Sure, when you look at a fully-hasted rogue with their epic at 60th level during their 10-seconds-of-fame that their discipline gives them, they could look pretty awesome. But rogues have a LOT of weaknesses to balance that out, which people also tend to ignore when they see a couple of really big backstabs in a row. All the usual melee difficulties, plus the rogue-specific ones. Like having pretty much NADA for escape skills. And having such low AC and Hitpoints that we can often go from full health to zero before a cleric can get a CH off. And there's the HUGE fact that rogues are the only melee class (well, maybe bards go here too) that NEED another melee class in order to function normally. Dependency on OTHER melees when you are melee is intriguing, but often frustrating when forming groups.<P>4) Pre-50 is another story. From around level 15 to about level 35 or 40 (I *think* - it's been a long time since my rogue was in that range), untwinked rogues are still a little under-balanced. Not nearly as bad as they used to be, but they still find themselves outdamaged, outclassed, and sometimes out-rogued by other classes. Face it, in areas with very little mix of living vs. undead, there are MANY other classes with better stealth ability than the pokey little rogue. And the fact that people are still afraid of rogues stealing all the loot with pickpocket still hurts the class in a pickup situation. Not every rogue can be twinked and powerleveled by their uber-guild!<P>Anyway, that's my $0.02. The rogue was not my first class, and it's FAR from my only class, but it is my favorite class. It was hard to stick with it back in the early days (my rogue was born just after midnight on April 2, 1999), and I was immensely frustrated (as were most rogues of the time) with the implementation of the class. I think I have enough experience with other classes to say that rogues are finally in the same ballpark as everyone else - so long as all of the other classes stay in their same relative power-levels, rogues fit in nicely. I would not like to see that change.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It's been my recent observation that any class that feels like it isn't likely to get killed, or will survive the longest, generally considers itself balanced.<P>Hence the desire for ports, such a powerful evade, or even increased speed with overland travel.  Rangers, warrior, pallys, all make that type of request.  In different forms, but the same request.<P>I think rogues do obscene amounts of damage, having heard reports of one rogue out damaging an entire group of comparable levels by himself.  I have learned that if you don't want a rogue to ks, make him face the baddie.<P>My major concern is that back stab is too much power with too little risk.  Rangers pay the price of high damage output by getting habitually smeared, and consequently termed mana sinks.<P>I have no problem with evade except it's lack of presence for other high damage, low ac classes.<P>After all, the first thing I would do if I got stabbed in the "back" (or tail, rear side of my blob-like substance, etc.) would be to turn around and squash whatever it was that did that.<P>As a player, when I fight bandits anything that backstabs me goes to the top of my "hate" list instantly.  Evade should help, other wise rogues would be worthless, but not create such a low threat environment for such a high damage dealing class.<P>Z Kai<BR>Bohdan<BR>ArchAngel</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The rogue class is fairly balanced.. would be nice to see a few changes.<P>1) Poison with charges.  Single use is annoying and costly, not to mention takes up too much room.  It's possible to do, just a bit of coding.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"><P>2) Safefall could be more useful if it were increased to 150 or 200.  Not steping on monks toes at all because fall damage (even with safefall) is also based on weight, and rogues generally weight 100-150 with equip while monks are much lower.. just a nice feature.<P>3) Throwing.  One of our so-called class traits, barely useful.  Range is too low, damage is too low (considering most higher damage thrown weapons are not stackable).  As I've seen mentioned before, inhereted rogue range of +50-100.  Also increase damage of crits or make better dmg/delay weapons.  Why can't rogues use shattering hammers from the Hammerfal bracer? *boggle*<P>4) Pick pocket - definitely no use 40+ especially with the lvl 45 cap on mobs except Ragebringer quest.  Perhaps a seperate set of stealable loot?  Heck, the 45 cap should be removed.. the magic item limit is the thing that gets everyone, other than that it's copper picking time.. in other words, do something with it 8)<P>5) Hide/sneak - should pass over zonelines and should stay if you go LD. I never understood why over zonelines never worked.  Also due to the large graphics and groups in Velious LDs aren't uncommon.  I find myself pondering if scouting is worth it because if I go LD I'm dead meat.<P>6) Evade - fair enough.  However, in addition make it possible to evade while moving, and also raise dodge/etc caps to a considerable degree.  Perhaps make a disc called "Stealth fight" which drops you to the bottom of the aggro list and keeps you there for 1 min, 70 min recharge time, lvl 56 (we lack a variety of discs, most are similar rehashed stuff).<P>7) Quest for soulbound lockpicks?

</FONT><HR>1) Change the look on POG armor.<P>PoG armor looks terrible. It's called assassin's armor and it shines brighter than the sun with all it's wierd colours. Hardly fitting for an assassin.<P><BR>2) The poison system sucks <P>Poison. I know it was recently "redone", and while I didn't think it could get any worse, someone at Verant actually succeeded in doing just that.<BR>Poison as it was and is, is totally useless (except for pvp surprise attacks). If you think a little more creatively there are many ways of making poison a useful skill. <BR>For example applying a poison could be a skill (like hide is a skill). Effect of applying could be a weapon getting a small proc for a certain amount of time or until zone. <P> <BR>3) Evade.<P>Looking at the initial post, it seems to me you don't know how evade works.<BR>1- EVEN IF you get a "succesful" evade it can still fail.. (yeah that makes sense doen't it?)<BR>2- Evade does fail quite a lot.<BR>3- If a monster hits you while you are trying to evade it will fail. The evade skill is built upon the hide skill which doesn't allow movement, therefor the knock back effect from hit will ruin your evade attempt. <BR>4- Rogues often move a lot during fights, but if you are not standing PERFECTLY still evade will fail due to same bug as mentioned above.<P>What is there to nerf again? It's already bugged imo.<P><BR>4) sneak/hide should work across zonelines.<P><BR>5) Mrylokar gloves are close to nonexistant. What's up with that?<P><BR>And as follow up. You said yourself you had no time to research rogues. It is my impression from the other class talks that you at times show very little knowledge about classes. I hope you don't try the same here, because you DO NOT know more about rogues than the ones who actually play one.

</FONT><HR>Love my rogue  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Only one thing I would like to see.  I know a lot of people have mentioned the idea of having soul bound lockpicks, but I want to expand on the idea. First off, if soul bound is the way to go then perhaps make tinkered mechanical lockpicks a soul bound item.  This would make them useful because as far as I know the tinkered version of lockpicks is no different then the store bought model, but what I think would be even better as far as plausablity goes is to allow rogues with a lockpick skill above 200 (this would make it a post 50 skill as well) the ability to pick locks without any lockpicks.  So, in effect this would be like saying that a rogue who was very highly skilled at picking locks could do it with things he found lying about.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Number one, instill doubt NEVER goes off, well it does but rarely..very rarely..why is this? <BR>#2 I currently have 250 make poison skill, hey i love the stuff, but it gets realllllly annoying needing to devote 1 full bag(to fit the 4 or 5 diff components of one poison) and then further, that poisons DONT stack, which is a real pain ; ( stackable poisons would allow me to make a ton, then bag em while im at the vendor, please do this? = )<P>#3 PLEASE PLEASE dont touch evade. I hit evade a ton, sometimes i fail, sometimes i dont. Even when i dont, unless the person taunting off me is a sk trying really hard casting many agro spells, or a warrior with epic, or a willsapper, the mob is back on me within 2 secs unfortunately. Please leave evade as is.<P>#4 PLEASE make disarm useful. It currently works on non magic weapons only, making it 100% useless in velious, since every mob there uses magic weapons(velium)<P>thanks for your time = D,<BR>Slott Matchyn<BR>lvl 60 assassin TM ^_^</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I've already seen several other discuss this already but I wish to add my thought on the matter as well. I didn't read everything because there's just to much to do that right now.<P>One, I believe rogues should get the Feign Death ability. Later of course then monks and others. Maybe 35 and cap it low at 150 or 125. We are supposed to be the stealthy decieving class so why can't we decieve our enemies into thinking that we died?<P>Second, I believe we should get crits and deadly strikes on something other then throwing weapons. Either that or implement better throwing weapons and possible make them retrievable if they actually hit the enemy or maybe a few of them off the ground. Not all of them but a few.<P>Third, this is the least important and I don't really care much about it but I saw a few others post it. Tracking. We are considered scouts so we should be able to track our enemies.<P>That's about it so far.

</FONT><HR>Hide/sneak cannot be made to work across zone lines or LD?  It's a friggin program, they can be creative and figure a way out.. just like they did for shaman potions.<P>For instance, when a rogue zones while hiding and sneaking, set his mana to 10 or something.  When the other server inspects the character and sees the mana equals 10 and is a rogue, make the server activate the hide/sneak and set the mana back to 0.  done.  I'm sure there are plenty of empty data fields that they can use.

</FONT><HR>Basically from my experience as a lvl 22 Rogue on Vaz. we are fine and just need a little<BR>tweaking.  Things I would like to see done.<P>1)  Throwing weapons:  As most other posters have complained, there does not seem to<BR>be much reason to use them.  My Barby rogue started using throwing stars on Vaz.  After<BR>realizing how limited they are in range, I made the run to Qeynos, and began fletching. <BR>Even the simplest fletched bows with the simplest arrows have almost double the range of<BR>the stars.  Maybe yall could add throwing darts to fletching or smithing skill.  Make them<BR>long range but low damage for use in pulling.  Could make a whole line of these as skill<BR>increased based around arrow damage.<P>2)  Pickpocket:  please add a message like critical hits that tells your group what you are<BR>pickpocketing.  I think many groups have a problem with this skill because they dont<BR>know how little we usually get from the skill.<P>3)  Evade:  please be very careful and test your "fix" thoroughly.  I have never seen a mob<BR>that I have evaded take off after someone across the zone.  Many times I will evade, miss<BR>a backstab, and have the mob whacking me again even with a warrior taunting.<P>4)  Hide/sneak:  I agree with most of the posters and would like to see this work across<BR>zone lines.<P>5)  Sneak:  How about adding an increase in speed to sneak at lower levels?  Then<BR>sneak/hide speed could be increased from 50-60 (if it all ready is not)<P>6)  Please move the rogue trainer in Fironia Vie, I really dont understand why my poor<BR>Barby rogue should have to go all the way back to the mainland to train my skills.  Maybe<BR>just add a window behind her like the bank has.<P>7)  Add more Spear type rogue usable weapons, My Barby rogue is a big burly guy, He<BR>needs a spear.  By far the best weapons for rogues are daggers.  Maybe just dupe some of<BR>the daggers, give them a Spear/Trident graphic and add them in some zones (leave the<BR>stats and everything else the same as on the daggers)<P>8)  A nice wish list item would be some type of speed enhancing boots, Maybe a new<BR>temple of Ro quest.<P>In closing, I quit playing EQ back in June 2000, officially canceling on August 1, 2000. <BR>The Barbarian rogue is the class I reactivated my account in December to play.  This is by<BR>far the most balanced class in EQ, give a rogue the right set of conditions and he is a<BR>powerhouse, remove those conditions and we are a fourth rate-mana sponge tank.<P>Jeamus Nightbringer<BR>22 season Rogue of Bristlebane<BR>Vaz.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Everyone says Rogue poison isn't stackeble when it is in fact.  If you can't make the poison multible charges, there are ways around it:<P>Combine 10 poisons of the same type in some sort of bag.  The result would be a keg of poison.  It would have 10 charges of summon <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif">oison.  This way you only have to carry 1 bottle that can't be used to apply poison to summon 10 that can.<P>In addition, it would be nice to see religious poisons used.
