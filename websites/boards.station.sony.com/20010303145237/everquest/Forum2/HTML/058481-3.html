</FONT><HR>     When SoV came out the drop rates in PoG were ridiculously high . . and the loot was way too good for the difficulty level of the zone.  However the drop rates have since been adjusted and I swear youll only see one drop in 50 mobs.  <P>I really dont think its that out of whack anymore.<BR>Thats about 7 or 8 pieces if you clear the entire zone,  which can take you a day or so to do.<P>     The only change I think they need to make now is to put the BPs and Legs on the minibosses.  These Items are way too nice to come be coming off the common easy to kill relatively fast spawn trash in PoG.  <P>On another note as a long screwed over Iksar SK . . PoG in the first few weeks was a godsend :P.  I had seen more than one BE breastplate drop that I would have recieved but couldnt wear.<P><BR>     <P>     <BR>     </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Millie:  "Incoherent argument?"  You understood it, therefore it isn't incoherent.  It's a rather elementary deduction from your own comments, which I quoted.  Belligerent?  I'm sorry if calling a spade, a spade (or an elitist, an elitist) is belligerent to you.  I can see how the truth would be insulting to you.<P>Nice attempt at backtracking.  Your post did not say anything about the tougher quest armour.  All you said was that PoG needed to be nerfed.  Try rereading your post.<P>That's funny.  You claim I'm interpreting your post (quoting you doesn't leave room for interpretation), and then you say I'm asserting propositions someone else did.  [Perhaps you could look up the BBS definition of troll.  Clearly not there.]  <P>Interesting world you live in.  "I just think, as does nearly EVERYONE else on this thread, that PoG rewards are out of line with the difficulty of the zone's encounters."  As I said, EVERYONE does not agree with that.  Most have indicated that the quest armours are way too rare and difficult.  That does not equate to PoG being too easy.<P>I'm sure you weren't going to assert I was just being greedy.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif">  I'm sure you've got a bridge in Firiona Vie you'd like to sell me, too.  You've only indicated that anyone that didn't want PoG nerfed were those gimps that can't do anything else, so why would I possibly jump to that conclusion?   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif"><P>This isn't a job, it's a game.  If you are treating it as a job, seek psychological counseling.  The PoG stuff is hardly uberloot.  I agree that the quest stuff ought to be less rare and enhanced from where it currently stands.  I do not believe that PoG ought to be nerfed.<P>The next time you want to launch an elitist diatribe, maybe you ought to use less inflammatory language.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif">  You've admitted to being an elitist, and I've quoted your comments.  I didn't assume anything.  You conveyed everything I've said you have.  No one, not even your FoH brethren, have suggested I was wrong in my analysis.  Others have concurred in it.<P>Perhaps you ought to return to the FohNoos where you can rant against us all gimps without challenge.  It appears to be what you are accustomed to.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Millie:  One more thing.<P>&lt;&lt;"And guess what? Just to cut-off your next brilliant rejoinder , as a Karana worshipping druid, I can't get anything from there."<P>&gt;&gt;I'm glad you anticipated and boldly countered something I was not even contemplating saying. I hope you feel special. Would you like a cookie?<P>Now let's look at your opening statement in your own diatribe:<P>&gt;&gt;FACT: Anyone who wants PoG to remain un-nerfed is someone who's equipped in a piece or more of PoG armor, can't get anything better, and doesn't want its stats to go down.<P><BR>I'm sure even you could see why I made my above caveat.  I guess you weren't contemplating saying it since you already had said it.  If you don't want to be torn apart on this board and remain as inflammatory as you've been, perhaps just a smidgeon of consistency and a remembrance of what you've already posted would benefit you.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Stop talking about Corroded armor and how it compares to PoG drops.  We know it is almost as easy to get each piece.  Still less likely with corroded, plus the fact that you have to get gems means it should be a little better.<P>However, Kael and SS armor is hard has heck to get.  Like, there is 1 piece of SS armor on my server.  Just 1.  0 Kael armor (dunno if anyone has tried).  But it is so damn hard it should reap better rewards then what 6-10 people can get in PoG considering it takes a force of 40+ to succesfully do anything in ToV.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Either decrease the difficulty obtaining them, or increase the drop rate a little for thurg, a lot for kael/ss, increase the quality of kael/ss, and increase the gem drop rate by a lot seem like the right things to do.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>  Right from the start everyone should read the first post then skip all the way down to Strom`s post (Phelan`s post is pretty good to btw).<BR>  <BR>   This whole thread has basicly turned into a call for the Nerfing of the PoG, wich is wrong. It started as a thread about drop rates and they used PoG to compare. <BR>  <BR>   As far as people in the PoG calling people who have never killed Trak or VS "Gimps" I say you are all way to full of your fantasy life on EQ and should step back and take a look at yourselfs.<BR>   <BR>   You are right in one way some people might not ever kill Trak or VS or see VP or ST, but who the **** are you to call them "Gimps" . Some people have things going on in their lifes that dont let them play EQ like a powergamer or be in a "Uber guild" , and Im willing to bet its not due to a Lack of playing ability. You people have chosen to make EQ what it is for you, dont worry about everyone else. This game is not that hard if you have half a brain, and I honestly think that the only thing that puts you apart from A_Newbie_01 is that you Chose to spend countless hours playing EQ to get where you are , and thats it. Not a lack of playing abilty not the curse of the Gimp just Time sitting in front of your computor.<P>  As for the Drops of the quest items increase the drops. Make the really hard Quest lewt worth the effort to get it. Period . Dont nerf the PoG more. <P>  And I also have to agree with the people saying Evil races will be shafted if the PoG does get nerfed More.. When Kunark came out armor items for these race/class combos were put in dungons that screwed their faction, while the Good race/class combos just got to kill away. Most if not all said screw faction because they dont wannna pay 40kpp for legs for their class that drop off VS (wich should be a whole other thread.. increase the spawn rate pls) Evil races should be upset if PoG gets nerfed even more. More upset than the Pallys Rangers and Druids who cant go to PoG, they got it good for along time now let evil have its day. I do believe however Pallys, Rangers and Druids should beable to get comparable armor at some other place in a similar way. its all about Balence and I hope Verant can workt it out.<BR>                     <BR>              Peace Out Nuff said <BR>              Sancho <BR>              Zakon <BR>              Natass <BR>              Emarr...<P>PS.

If your so Uber im sure you will get what you want and people going to PoG or even PoH or PoF should not effect you in the least.

Only way it could effect you non Gimpy players is :<BR>     <BR>     <BR>     1. those people you call "Gimps" are <BR>        in "Your" camp spot in the PoG <BR>     or <BR>     2. those people you call "Gimps" stop buying<BR>        "Your" Pharmed VS and Dragon lewt<P>   half way threw Furors post I thought it was a good post and agreed whole heartedly. The drops on Quest items should be increased and the Ooo so important stats should reflect the Difficulty it took to get it . period. But for the love of God dont go screaming Nerf havent you people learned anything about verant since you started playing this game nerfs effect everyone.<BR>    Oh I did forget, your guild is the most Elite guild in all of Everquest so why would you care about everyone else you can get what you want at the drop of a hat. Im sure your twinks would put alot of us Gimps to shame.<BR>     peace out this thread has made me sick to my stomach, I wonder why I ever came back to everquest with *******s like your elitest crew around. you people are the ones thats ruining everquest. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I find this a bit ironic that the guildleader of the possibly strongest guild on the server Veeshan is having a temper tantrum. You would think that you would be up to the challenge and difficulty of the task. Has the mighty finally found a weak spot within itself? Appears to me if they can't take the quick way out and overwhelm MOBs with the countless numbers of their members. IT IS TOO TOUGH FOR US!!!! I like the way it is set up Verant. It finally gives peeps something to truely work their behinds off for and savor it once they get it. Besides, if the armor is no drop. Fires of  Heaven would just be out farming and selling it anyway. So quit your snivelling Furor and play the game!!!! You won't die of a heart attack if you can't get the armor in a day or a week. It's just funny and very satisfying to see you work for something for once. Instead of dominating everything else you touch and ruin for everyone else.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Throkmorten, the problem isn't "d00d my uberguild can't get nice stuff!" because they CAN get nice stuff... in POG.  He said there's a problem when the nice stuff you can kill, relatively easily, for (the thing you are accusing him of wanting to do) is not as nice as the stuff that is harder to kill for and find on a quest.<P>I'm not a big Fires of Heaven fan, I don't like big guilds out of principle, but you really need to read the post before firing off a flame like that, it makes you look bad.<P>Quests that are more difficult and longer and require drops as rare as the items they are allegedly replacing should result in better gear.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Miir:  It's you who appears not to get it.  Sancho's point, like mine, is that your concerns about the quest armours, does not transfer into a nerfing of PoG.  Some of us casual folks aren't "gimps" like Millie insists, but individual's with limited time due to more important things than this game: family, work, friends, pets, improving your mind, etc.  It's the attitude expressed by her that has so many people annoyed with you folks.<P>It's great that you guys think it's not challenging and tedious to farm PoG, and choose the tedium of farming Temple of Veeshan and elsewhere.  So how does that translate into no one else being allowed to try for some class armour?<P>Again, I agree the quest stuff is too fricking rare.  But that does not mean that PoG ought to be nerfed.  What's wrong with others having a shot at some decent equipment?  How does it possibly effect you?  You folks could be wearing tattered leather and everyone on Veeshan will still bow before you and praise your leetness, so there's no threat to the respect and adulations you'll receive for knowing how to spend 8 hours a day or more playing a game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Currently we have about 50 people that play on a regular basis.<BR>Compare this with other guilds on our server such as Celestial Tomb and Unholy Paradox whos memberships are up to 200.<P>The mobs that drop the quest items are not 'too tough'. It's the fact that the drop rate on the items is ridiculously low.

</FONT><HR>AMEN. I'm currently a guildmaster and not the leader of a HUGE UBER GUILD. Therefore i cannot even think about even doing the thurgdain quests.But if the drop rates were uped by at least 100% i could at least go on a occasional kael, TOV or any raid and get a piece i needed. YES THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED. why cant i go to planes of phat lewts and get myself some armor</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Killing 200 MOBs for one item? I love the idea!!! It keeps the market from getting over flooded and the value up. If it's not no drop that is. And tell my why everyone is so impatient. There is a lifetime ahead of everyone and time is on your side. Enjoy the game. That is what it is really all about. The "nice stuff" comes with time. But then I must realize that some impatient peeps feel they must have it all and have it now. Where would the game be then? Dead. That is what. Everquest would not exist as it would become boring. Some say, "Ok, I've done all I want to do. I'm done. End game." This keeps it interesting and also keeps the game alive for a long time to come. Laugh all you want at my post and ones to come. Does it bother me? Hell no!!! Something that poses a severe challenge should be accepted with open arms, not selfish minds. Verant!! Keep up the super work!!!!! I'm up for any challenge you throw at me!!!! By rights, you should feel the same. But hey. Not everyone can have patience......</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Agreed here Bump these quest drop rates tremendously, and think about making PoG a higher level to enter.  These should be a progression from fear-hate -&gt;sky(which also is weak) -&gt;PoG -&gt;quest armors.  Granted they should be difficult but come on be serious.<P>Also if you are unwilling to change that then move PoM to an easier location and make it simmilar to PoG but again with the higher level cap.  Im tired of losing robes and BP's to twinks.<P>60 Oracle Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>WOW! I agreee with FoH for the first time. :-) One additional comment is that the whole Velious expansions is ridiculously biased twoard the Kael faction. Kael has TONS of quest. The Claws of Veeshan faction has about 3 and they are so hard that noone has ever completed even one of them. I refer to the 3 quests given by the dragon in ToV which require goign into the Halls of Testing and returning FOUR items. Yeah right!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058481-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058481.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058481-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058481-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058481-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058481-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=058481&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=058481&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
