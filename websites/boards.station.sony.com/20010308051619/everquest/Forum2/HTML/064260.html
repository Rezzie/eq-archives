&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>First off, I want to let you know that I am not an uber player, or part of an uber guild.  I play on a mature server (Rodcet Nife) and am in I guess what you would concider a mid-sized guild... big enough to do raids but small enough to know every player's name in the guild list.<P>Also, for the sake of civility, if you want to post something negative here, there are plenty of other threads that are just posts away from being deleted or locked, rant there.  Please keep replys intelegent, and don't post because you don't like one person's view.<P>I am a level 52 cleric, who fought his way up the experience chain the hard way, never power leveled, never having uber gear, ect.  I have not posted in these posts in the past because it was too much negativity to bear, I just did my thing and played the game.  But lately things are getting so skewed, that it is no longer enjoyable for me.<P>This post is for Verent, not as a rant, or to pin the blame on the donkey, just to give you my point of view as to what went wrong and where.  You made mistakes, but you are human, so it's allowed.  Unfortunately, your mistakes effected a large population of customers, and things got blown out of the water.  But hopefully you will learn from your mistakes and will make better games in the future as a result of what you have learned in the Everquest experiment.<P>You made a wonderful game, it was unlike anything that has ever been done before.  And as a first, you wrote the rules as you went, and made some errors, but tried your best to return to the origanal spirit of the game.  You had a Vision(tm) where all players started on a level playing feild, for no other reason than to keep one class from overpopulating the game, and to add flavor to the game by having a variety of viable options open to its players.  And for a long time you had great success.  I admit, there were some things that were just wrong, like the experience penalty for hybreds.  I agreed with it at first, until it became apparent that maybe the penalty was too harsh, making it not enjoyable to play that class.<P>But it seems like lately you have forgotten something significant about the game as it was when it was released.  At first, you could pick a number of variations of class/race/dieties, each with distinct advantages/disadvantages.  Everyone who did some research 3 months after the game was released could pick a class/race/diety knowing full well the disadvantages, but liking the advantages.  I have played a cleric almost exclusively since I started playing a year ago.  I have also played a monk and a druid, but never got them past level 20, I had too much fun with my cleric.  When I made my cleric, I knew that for the most part, it was not the most exciting class to play.  I have been on 7 dragon runs and have yet to see a dragon.  Did I complain? No, because I knew that was gonna happen when I started.  See, for me the excitement or fun was not from 'beating the mob', but from being the one who kept the ball rolling.  It was me that kept the people alive who won or lost the fight.  I loved having to pay close attention to everything that was going on around me, knowing that one mistake could spell doom for the entire group.  It was a position of responsibility and garnered trust from my fellow players.  I was proud of being able to say that I had escaped certain doom on many occations, only to emerge victorious in the end due to a little luck and the ability to think fast on my feet.  I was never bored.  I know that a lot of clerics complained about the med/heal cycle being too repetitive to want to level a cleric to high levels.  I could write a book on why I think they thought that way and how it would have been better if a few things were different, but that is not why I am writing this post.  But my point is, the did not come into the class blind.  I'm sure that more than once, if they bothered to look into it, the would have seen warning signs that the high level game for clerics was med/heal/buff.  But then again if you break it down like that, a warrior does nothing more then attack/taunt/kick.  Do they complain they don't have enough to do?<P>Your present problems started when you forgot that people knew the consequences of choosing certain class/race/diety combonations.  If a certain class has done the same thing since the first day Everquest had been released, how can they come to you 2 years after release and say that they are unhappy with thier current role?  Sure the game has to evolve to remain fresh for its long term player base, but at what cost?  I know that you had certain expectations of class roles when you developed Everquest, but if an oversight of coding mistake happens to make the class behave differently than you had intended, is it really broken?   You have said yourself it was an experement, you didn't really know what to expect.  So how can you turn around 2 years later and say that was not your intention?  It has been that way since it began, and sure, it was not perfect, but it was not so bad that the entire game dynamics as they had evolved should be changed.<BR>What I am trying to say is that there should be a penalty for playing every class.  For me it was not being able to solo effectively, or hit the broad side of a barn with a weapon, and burn huge amounts of mana if I decided to cast a damage spell on a mob.  I knew what the draw backs were, but I also knew the advantages of being a cleric.  I might not be able to solo, but if I tried hard enough, I could always find a group.  You felt the game was too dependant on groups having clerics, but at the same time clerics were dependant on groups.  So it evened out.  But some classes were saying that they were feeling neglected by groups, and could not find a group that wanted them.  But did they have other avenues? Yes.  They could solo.  If they did not want to solo, they could create a new character that was more group friendly.  At one time, I got tired of needing a group to get any amount of experience, so know what I did?  Did I make a big noise that it was unfair? No, I knew going in that clerics were one of the worst classes to solo with.  So I made a druid, who were famous for thier soloing abilities.  But I found that it was not as fun to solo, so I stopped playing the druid, and found new love for my cleric.<P>Being so group dependant with my cleric, I learned how groups work, how dungeons work, how other classes work.  I know every ability and shortcoming of every class/race by fighting by thier side and seeing the effects of these advantages/disadvantages.  Now lets change the game so that a class who has gone 50+ levels by themselves and make them more group friendly.  They might be unaware of the subtleties of each class/race.  No matter what you do, it will not change this fact.  You cannot change a classes role as it was in a game for 2 years overnight.  No matter how much they want to adapt to the change, it will adversely effect all classes.  Which brings us to what is happening now.<P>You had good intentions.  Classes were complaining that they did not have the abilities of other classes, and wanted 'balance'.  I think you got hung up on what balance meant.  To me, in the Everquest world, balance meant that each class had its own pluses and minuses.  But you started to listen to people who focused on what they could not do, and failed to see what they could do.  In order to fully satisfy these people, what you would have to do is convert every class into a generic class, where everyone had exactly the same abilities.  That totally goes against the spirit of the game as it was envisioned in the beginning.<BR>I am going to say some not so nice things about druids.  Now understand I am not saying this is typical of druids, or that all druids are evil, or that I hate/envy druids.  The reason I am using druids to make my point is because of a minority of druids that made a lot of noise and did not understand what thier class was being used for.  There are clerics who are just as bad.  Every class has its members that will never be happy with what they have and as such ruin it for everyone else in the class.  I am using druids because thier complaints are the reason for what the clerical community is suffering right now.  Now, druids were never meant to be primary healers, nor were shamen.  If they were, you would have given them better healing spells.  They were intended to be useful in a pinch.  But they had other roles as well.  Shamen were known for thier great stat buffs and ability to reduce damage output of mobs.  Druids were known for thier great soloing abilities and as secondary buffers/healers.  That is how the classes evolved, and that was the status quo.  If you made a druid a month ago, you would either know right away or soon after starting, that druids were not the preferred healers at higher levels.  It was a fact.  If you did not like it, then don 't play a druid.  Its like going to university to follow a certain carreer, and then realise that that carreer was not what you really wanted to do with your life.  So do you insist that your job description be changed?  You would usually, if you were brave enough, just take up another carreer, of suck it up and stay with the carreer you are not totally satisfied with.<BR>I agree that the penalty for casting a complete heal was too low.  The game should force you to use some stratagy to be able to cast such a powerful spell.  I have seen allusions to the wizard Ice Comet spell, and I am in total agreement.  You should have to think a little before casting the spell, to decide if it is really worth the risk to cast it.  But if you took the IC spell and caused it to cause so much agro that if it was cast, the wizard would probably die, then know what would happen?  The wizard would stop casting the spell and therefor loose its best spell and become obsolete.  The woudl no longer be able to find groups (I know, it is hard for wizards as it is).  But clerics at high levels HAVE to cast complete heal.  When your tank is being whacked for +300 dmg a round, a spell with a 4.5 second cast time that heals 600 hit points does not cut it.  Health points drop much faster than you can return them.  Causing the death of the tank, and therefor the group.  So no matter how much you tweak them, superior heal will never be a spell that will make a druid or shaman a primary healer.  The game was designed around the ability to restore all the hitpoints of the tank.  To change it would mean a retooling of the entire high level game.  I am all for making them more effective healers.  But shamen and druids have abilities that clerics don't have, so if they can be primary healers, where does that leave the cleric?  Useless.  We will become useful only for our ability to restore experience upon death.  But you don't need a group to do that.  Just sit at the entrance of a zone and you will have all the oppertunity you need to cast that spell.  Without a group, you stop getting experience, and stop progression.  So the cleric gets shelved in order to play a class that you can progress with, or quit the game.  And if it was only clerics, I would be dissapointed, but not angry.  We are a minority, and if to appease the masses you need to get rid of a minority, then so be it.  Make druids the prime healers of Everquest and forget that you once had a class of armored healers called clerics.  Make clerics of innoruk drop druid plane armor and everyone will be happy, except for the clerics, but thats ok, sometimes you need to hurt a few people to help a lot of people.<BR>But your actions are not just against clerics.  If you ask any class if they are totally happy with the way thier class is set up, you will always get a no.  People by nature are never satisfied.  If we were, progress would never be made, and we would become stagnant.  And as you add more to one class, you take away from another when you change roles of classes.  Let us have our role in Everquest, it is what we know and what we do best.  It is a shame that players have become dependant on us but they are also depentant on tanks and enchanters.  Are you going to tweak the Necro class so that they can tank or be enchanter clones in order to make them more useful?  Will you make Warriors and Monks able to cast spells so that they can be as versatile as a hybrid?  Will you make hybrids tougher in order to make them equal in fighting abilities to Warriors and Monks?  You must draw a line somewhere.  You must preserve the face of norrath.  The more you try to please everyone, the more you dissapoint everyone.  You have lost sight of the big picture, where everyone has a job and are specialized to do that job.  You will have a population of jacks of all trades and masters of none.<BR>Most people assume that these changes effect only uber guilds or players of the highest levels.  But it doesn't.  Doing things like nerfing the donal's chestplate do effect only a very small portion of players.  Things like the heal/agro change effect everyone, if not immediately then at some point down the road.  Lets face it, someday the majority of players will be able to go on a Trakanon raid.  I remember thinking that I would never be able to go on a Naggy Raid as it was Uber-guild only.  But as they find new challenges, they make way for us lesser folks to take what they left.  To think that you will never hold an epic weapon or slay one of the uber mobs mentioned in other posts is unrealisitic.  And also, this does not only effect uber mob raids.  Our guild was part of a Fear raid last week and it was a total mess, as clerics were dropping like flys, for doing what they were meant to do.  To say to a cleric don't heal is like telling a warrior not to attack.  If we don't do what we are made to do, what do we do?  Might as well save our mana and just rez the fallen heroes after the battle.  Or be a hero ourselves and heal the tank that will last an extra minute because you sacrified your self.<P>To sum up what the topic is about, people are leaving not because they are spoiled, or can't adapt to change, or are just having a hissy fit.  They are leaving because the very basic aspects of the game they enjoyed are being removed.  And clerics are not the only class to feel the bite of class balancing.  But if you took a pole as to what class is getting the shaft in this issue, clerics would win.  We loose all and gain nothing in return.  And when the clerics leave, so do the people who have depended on them.  If they can't go on an adventure where winning is a possibility, then they won't go.<P>I don't know if this will spell the end of Everquest.  I do know that the game has changed more in the past month than ever before, and that is not nessesarily a good thing.  I am sure that a few of you will continue on, playing the game you love.  But a lot will not unless Verant, you change things quickly.  I hope you see what is happening and don't think it is just the usual 'nerf flack' you get every change.  I logged on today, and for the first time ever, I just sat there, trying to decide if I wanted to play.  I told some good friends in my guild that I might not be there much longer.  I am just tired.  I will play my monk and maybe powerlevel a few twinks of friends but my career as a cleric is over I am afraid.  I am sad that I now know that I will never see 60.  I am saddened by the fact that something that I enjoyed is gone.  I knew the day would come when I would hang up Sonard's spell book, but I never thought it would end like this.  Maybe I am over-reacting.  Maybe in 2 weeks Sonard will be back at Seb putting the fear of Tunare into frogloks.  But unless some changes are made, I don't see it happening.  I spent 49 levels finding death at every corner.  I don't want to spend my last 8 levels that way.  For now, I will play my monk and pray for better days. I just hope there will be someone to heal me when I need it.<P>Peace<P>Sonard, Level 52 Cleric<BR>Officer of the wonderful guild Crew<BR>Rodcet Nife<BR>Retired</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

(My wife for one)<P>I too have left Norrath.<BR>But I actually left several weeks ago over other things.  I truely have to wonder though, how they can wait 2 years to decide to change such basic aspects of the game.<P>On the BP nerfs.  They don't bother me near as much as the fact that the people who spent the time to get them are getting done over.  If your going to nerf them, then give these players some real compensation.  Abashi is the one who said in the past that the only real thing of value to take in this game is the players "time".  If that's true, then you owe the players who own the nerfed BP's some kind of real compensation.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Its not the BP nerf alone. It is a culmination of things that bring clerics to finally ask themselves...<P>"Why do I log on every night?"<P>Is it because I want to level? Really? Am I all that anxious for my new spells? Is it because I have a great time? Is it for the FUN? This IS a game isnt it? Its about fun.. or its supposed to be. <P>In truth, for most clerics, it ends up being because fo the chatbox. Its about the fact that so many people 'need' you. They wait for you to log on, etc. But are you the one enjoying yourself? Maybe, maybe not. If not, then your time left in the game is hanging by a thread. <P>Well then... that WAS the situation when I quit my cleric. That was 9 months ago. Since then, there has been a Tidal Wave of Nerf, after Nerf, after Nerf, after Nerf to the already narrow Cleric class. Those people who were hanging by a thin thread already have found that "now" is a good time to throw in the towel. Some trudge on of course, but a good number are calling it quits. Maybe they play a twink, maybe they quit altogether. <P>I have already begun to notice the effect that this is having on the High Level game. There seem to be about "half" as many 55-60 clerics online as there were 2 weeks ago. Perhaps this is a passing phase, perhaps they will all return. But if not, there will be a real outcry, not just by uberguilds like FOH, etc.... but by the entire playerbase... maybe even druids.<P>Players will adapt of course, but in this case, its not a natural adaption. Its a painful one. Noone benefits. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>hey cleric people on a sadder note. You and I both know that if any uber or whatever guilds really need a cleric they will just make a first level character and powerlevel it. Like someone said everyone will adapt but it's not going to be painless. <P>I love clerics and I'm a druid.  Me and a friend grouped together and he was a cleric and me being a druid we decided to kite stuff. it was fun. by the way that is a nasty combo druids and clerics kiting undead hehe   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  but it was fun until he had to quit  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> then I couldnt find another cleric to play with. so I just stop soloing and just grouped whenever I could or just buffed newbies in WC at the druid ring and watch everyone kill the druids there  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">. thats why one of my druids is only 35 after close to 2 years. I dont get into the game much anymore I just have fun and help people whenever I can.<P>Sal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Keeping it positive.<P>I agree- it annoys me a great deal when the rules of the game are changed very late.<P>Picture the Indy 500.  475 laps into the race, they proclaim, the first person who had an accident was the winner and give them the money.<P>Or baseball.  Just before the world series, the proclaim that foul balls count as negative points and rescore every game retroactively.<P>etc. etc.<P>The other problem is that they are having 2500 people on a server.  Sorry but there is -one- frenzied ghoul room.  One Efreeti camp.<P>That content hasn't been increased and in fact, has been nerf relative to the populaton.  Drop rate is the same as it was when there were 1100, 1300, 1500, and 1800 players.  So at 2500, EB's drop under half as often.<P>So the rare treasures of the world are harder and harder to get and more and more intensely camped.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>*sigh*  Yet another cleric that believes druids are behind the cleric nerfs.<P>I'm a druid and I think the nerfs are BAD, as does just about every other druid I've talked to.<P>Nerfing the cleric BPs and increasing aggro on heals is doing NOTHING to help druids.  Who do you think is better equipped to take hits from 50+ mobs: cleric with 950+ AC, or druid with 700+ AC.<P>And if you want to talk about taunt, try snare on for size.  Casting snare gets me summoned several times usually, toss in a single heal or a dot and I can get frenzied on.<P>Since you seem to believe (like many others) that there are no drawbacks to playing a druid, here is a short list:<P>1) Wide array of abilities, yet master of none.  (50+ is all about classes that can do something the best)<P>2) Lowest AC of all priest classes.<P>3) Worst planar armor, hands down.<P>4) 0 unique abilities.<P>5) Most defining abilities are shared or readily available in an item or potion. (sow, port, snare)<P>6) Lowest HPs of all priest classes.<P>7) Extremely costly buffs.  (SLN is 300 mana, 190 more than reso and only benefit is 2 hps regen)<P>8) Long casting time on spells. (SLD/SLN 6 seconds, Starfire 6.1 seconds, Drifting Death 6 seconds)<P>9) Least wis equipment of all Priest classes.<P>10) Only priest class with no mid-lvl quest armor.(one of only 2 classes without mid-lvl quest armor)<P>11) Outnuked by clerics until lvl 49. (with an exception from 39-43)<P>12) Very Limited DD types until 49 (all fire, save one magic nuke)<P>13) Total of 2 stackable dots up to 52 (and immolate just sucks).<P>14) ES armor effects are pretty much worthless (save arms).<P>15) Prejudiced against simply because of class. (Cleric_luclin says to druid group member, 'I don't rez dr00ds').<P>There are *many* drawbacks to playing a druid.<P>Korwin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hello sonard,<P>First I would like to say that you made a very nice post, but offending other classes (like druids) is not fair. As you said you as a Cleric allways find a group, that implies even if no one of you friends was on.<BR>Druids, Shamans and Hybrids needed their friends to get into group. A highlevel raid would not start without one Cleric per group but could start without even one of those classes I mentioned above on the whole raid. This was why all highlevel Dru, Sha, Pal, SK, Ran, Nec (and maybe others?) were complaining. They wanted to be at least an option for the 5th and the 6th space in a group - and if they got one space, they wanted to be able to grant some advantage to a group, they wanted an ability to contribute to the raid, like Clerics are only specialists in healing, warriors are only specialists in tanking, Rogues and Monks are only specialists in damagedealing and Enchanters are only specialists in Crowd Control.<P>Now there were lots of ideas about possible solutions and I will not repeat them here but there has to be another class that can be traded as a viable healer so that a party can start even if no Cleric is around. That would mean that Clerics cannot choose from one of the five groups sitting at a zoneline waiting for on of his kind, but he will still be the best in the healer's business. Expecting 5 players to wait for five hours just because the player of the Cleric still had to work or wanted to finish reading the last chapter of the bible is just not fair.<P>Well, I think giving the healing upgrade to Druids was wrong. It should have been given to Shamans. There are so many skills and abilities that can be enhanced to give viable reasons to invite a class, Master of (a better) Alchemy, Master of Damageshielding, Master of Resistance buffs, Master of Immunity buffs (spells and melee damage), Master of Movement (mobs and players), Master of (a better) Summoning, Master of (a better) Item Enchantment and Illusions - I mean really usefull illusions in highlevel raids, Master of Stunning and Stun-Immunity, Master of Spell Reflection, Master of Downtime-Reduction, and so on.<P>Why has a game to evolve around Healing, Crowd Control, Tanking and Damagedealing if there are so many other skills that would allow so nice tactics? And why are so many high-importance abilities concentraed on so few classes (Clerics heal and HP buff like no one else, Warriors tank and melee better than hybrids).<BR>No, I don't want them to be stripped, I just would say that 2 other healers (Dru, Sha) should be like a 150% Cleric (not like 2 Clerics!), 2 Hybrids should be able to act like a 150% Warrior and 2 Bards should be able to handle the job like a 150% Enchanter. And each of them should have some other skills that make them worth another 25% more so they are like 2 persons after all and not like one and a half, because being just 75% worth of another (specialised) class is not fair neither.<BR>So for example a team of Sha, Dru, Pal, Ran, Bar, Bar should be equal in output like a team of Cle, Cle, War, War, Mon, Enc - because there are 3 Classes that can heal (against 2 in the other group), two classes that can CC (against 1 in the other team), 4 people that can handle a weapon (against 3 in the other team). They should only have to be more skills in playing for they need to coordinate their skills and actions more because their abilities are split up.<P>To close this post, I would like to say that nerfing one or two classes big time while others get slightly enhanced is not the good solution.<BR>The other classes should get enhanced without nerfing others, and I mean enhancements in the above mentioned skills. EQ needs another acceptable healer-class and all other classes equal desireble, at least in certain places or in certain situations.<P>deef1</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well said Brother Sonard!!<P>First off......to some of the preceding posts, please read Sonard's post and understand his post is mostly concerning Clerics and not bashing Druids.  Also we all knew our short comings as our characters grew.  The majority of us took the mature approach and learned to overcome, improvise, and adapt. However, the loud mouth minority just whined; causing some good and bad changes to the game.<P>I can look at this change in Clerics in two ways:<P>1. A major OOOPS!! that needs to be corrected immediately.  So now what?  The tanks have to be more worried about peeling a MoB off a Cleric than thrashing a MoB?  As a Shaman I know the meaning of agro, and have oftenly spoke of changing my surname to Ubersummoned.  But I got used to it becuase I knew a good Cleric (like Sonard) was keeping an eye on me and I never had to worry about dying.  Now, if he ever decided to come back, he would definately be on the buff priority list, and I would have to save some mana to possibly heal him instead of doing my job....Making a MoB the sickest and most miserably feeling creature in Norrath.  This change puts a bigger responsibility on Druids, Shamans, and Necros (Yes Necros), which will pretty much change our roles.  VERANT......GET A CLUE!!!!!!<P>2. (Sad Reality)  Is it possible to figure a way to start incorporating a Stun/Root combination in your symphony of spell casting?  I have a bad feeling that Verant may not make a change anytime soon, and having a lvl 56 Shaman raised the honest way, I can understand how let down you must feel, but maybe finding a solution may get you back online and grouping with your Brothers and Sisters again.  I have been through alot of let downs:  <P>Oh my God! I get a pet!...... Aw Man!  it SUCKS<P>Cool I get a Malosi line spell.......CRAP! it gets resisted half the time.<P>Very nice, I get nice DoTs ..... Oh NO!! I'm agroed so bad the Tanks have a hard time taunting off of me.<P>Awesome, I can slow and cripple ..... refer to the above.<P>I'm sure you all get the picture.  I wouldn't have made it as far as I have with out a Cleric near me the majority of my life, but seems we will share a new commonality ...... the world of the Ubersummoned<P>If ya missed it the 1st time...<P>VERANT......GET A CLUE!!!!!!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I wish I knew what zone you were playing in where 5 groups where waiting for a cleric! I've never seen that myself.  You forget that druids are the most popular class in the game, there must be a reason for that.  Being a jack of all trades isn't a bad thing at all.  There is a lot of diversity there.<P>However, I do not want to engage in a druid vs. cleric battle. I find those things to be rather silly.  It's obvious that the druids/shaman have the ear of verant and the clerics got the shaft. It's the way of the world. The squeky wheel gets the grease seems to apply.<P>Elpanor</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Not saying there wont be anyone, theyre always be ppl playing down the road, but they will always look backon the haydays. Ill use Ultima online for instance i played that game from starting to finish.
