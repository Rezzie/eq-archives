</FONT><HR>I play a level 60 Cleric.<P>I wish people would realize that the *single* reason Verant is castrating the Clerics is to drive them from the game.  No Clerics mean no *big* heals.  No Clerics mean no 96% resurrections.  All this means YOU must play longer to get to levels, and longer to recover your exp and time when you die.<P>That equals extra money in Verant's pocket.<P>Verant: you can protest this all you want, but your actions are telling the real story.<P>I used to get all upset about the way Verant treats us Clerics.  We've watched everything useful to us (hence to the other players) get taken away.<P>I used to write here.  I used to offer very good solutions.  They were ignored.<P>Now, I just log in to EQ and my friends and I talk about Dark Age of Camelot.  We're quite excited.

</FONT><HR>Verant your nerfs are getting ridiclous now.<BR>Why are you making something a one minute casting time.  Who cares about balance I am not even a cleric and this is annoying teh hell out of me.  First it's the DONALS breastplate, then your nerf it even more.  Now your making a celestial item a one minute casting tiem.  Hey admin if you want to cancel my account or give me a warning go right ahead. (Usually they do because people speak out, but that's against the policy?) This must be the dumbest and  inconciderate nerf since Mark of Kharn. Won't you ask everyone what they think? Damn verant you make this game like it's a Job. its suppost to be fun half the tiem  it's not. I AM READY TO QUIT. THE ONLY REASON I DO NOT is BECAUSE of FRIENDS.  LET people have fun.  Here this is what you nerfed with clerics:<BR>1.  Mark Of Kharn actually was fun, but then made it slower casting time, and less heal power. (Great Job with the nerf!)<BR>2.  Donals Breastplate increased from 20, to 30.<BR>3.  Then yet again, now re-cast time of 7.5 minutes. Because of an "effect" on the player.  Another awesome nerf.<BR>4.  Now the Celestial Elixir, One minute casting time, that is the funniest thing I have ever heard.  NOT EVEN dungeon and dragons has that long of casting time.<P>I am not making this complaint just for my health.  I am making this complaint because why are you making this game work.  Make it fun, so many people want to have fun.  I can't anymore with this game, I just can't.  My friends and I are all quitting soon, the game was great when it first came out.  Some pathes were good, until this year. It's just nerf after nerf.  ASk everyone on the message board every cleric (which is there main, and funnest charecter to play as).  What they think about this to work there ass off in a plane, fighting for hours and hours.  Just to get ONE item, and then here that it's going to be nerfed soon.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>hmmmmmm, so many  posts about the game not being <BR>"fun" for high level Clerics anymore, and how wrong that is, but i seem to recognise a lot of these same names that posted against removing the spell book at levels lower than lvl 35, as even though staring at it for 35 levels is "not fun" , you had to do it, so everyone else has to do it too.<P> yet, you want to be taken seriously when you say that the Game now isn't "fun" for Clerics, and want sympathy and support.<P> Not all of you, i understand that, but many of you, left your own selves out on a limb in regards to garnering sympathy and / or support for YOUR problems and concerns, when you belittled or dismissed the concerns of others.<P> Especially those coming from high level players in general, stating no one under level 50 knows anything about the game. Guess what, the overwhelming majority of server populations is well under level 50, so you thereby went out and actively antagonised and alienatted a large porcentage of the player base who, having been treated otherwise, may have rallied to your support.<P> Server populations continue to climb, due to arrival of new players. Wake up and smell the coffee, the only way to survive is to respect all Classes and Levels of Players, and work together. <P> Level Range and / or Class wars and demeaning each other is only serving to divide the player base so badly that no one wants to help or support each other, making a loud enough protest against something like this  impossible.<P> Witness: Recent cleric /Druid Bash Fest<P> divided two classes, benefitted neither.<P><BR> I'm not convinced that some of these hanges were needed, but all of them, this close together, is just hard to believe, all of these have been in the Game for a good while, why now all of a sudden must they ALL go ?<P> i don't have an answer to that, but i do know that fighting amongst ourselves is only making it easier for each Class to get hit with negative impact "updates."<P> in short, we better all hang together, or surely we will all hang seperately.<P>                  naz</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I have never weighed in on a class discussion before, but felt compelled to with this nerf.<P>In case you are reading this thread Gordon, briefly some background on my guild and me.  We are about 100 players on Solusek Ro and I am a 57 Paladin.  We are in no way a guild like FoH or AL.  While we have considerable numbers, we simply do not attack the game the way they do.  So the nerf you have just annouced significantly impacts my guild and, I would surmise, most guilds in this game which will NEVER attain the profiency of FoH or AL.<P>First, I think its a travesty that when evaluating  potential nerfs, you use guilds like FoH as the paradigm (pun intended).  There will only be a handful of guilds across all servers that will ever be able to accomplish what FoH or AL does.  So to address game related issues using these guilds as an example does a terrible disservice to those of us that will never be able to "exploit" the benefits of a certain item.<P>Second, given the nature of most guilds, it takes a tremendous commitment to go to PoG and obtain these BPs for our clerics.  Perhaps the biggest obstacle is the faction issue.  Our guild planned long and hard for our first trip to PoG which only took place two weeks ago.  Before we went, we spent considerable time working on our epics for those that would be adversely impacted by the faction hits that would be taken.  After several months of preparing for PoG, we finally went with MANY of our members deciding to take the negative faction hit to help our fellow guildmates, primarily our clerics.  Why?  Because it was in the best interest of the entire guild to outfit our clerics, particularly those with their epic noodle.  So not only have you nerfed the most essential class in the game, yet again, you have also essentially penalized everyone who made an informed and conscious decision to help a fellow guildmate by absorbing a faction hit that is almost impossible to rehabilitate.  Can you imagine the sacrafice some of our enchanters, rangers, paladins and druids made in foregoing an epic to help our clerics?  And to now remove this item (because no matter what you call it, you have removed it as no  cleric can take the risk of committing to a spell with a 1 minute cast time) you have cost a slew a players a chance at their epic and have destroyed their faction for no reason.  Had this information been known, very few people would have been willing to sacrafice a faction that took 2 years to build up and the ability to pursue their epic weapons.  You cannot make EQ a "group" game and then punish players for acting in such a group-minded, altruistic way.<P>I have been through the nerfs before (DW Helm).  But I have to tell you, no nerf has as much impact as this.  Since the DW Helm was droppable, its only real impact was on server economies as players who purchsed DW Helms spent probably 10 times more than they should have following the nerf.  No big deal.  But this nerf is so much more fundamental and damaging.  You have taken the most essential class and have betrayed them.  You have also betrayed all of us who destroyed factions to secure that item.  And you have betrayed the entire server population if their is a mass exodus of clerics.  It is practically impossible to do anything post level 55 without a cleric, who already have started retiring their accounts as their role has primarily become one of an obedient dog:  heal, sit, heal, sit.  So while guilds such as FoH and After Life have fully explored Sleepers Tomb, PoM, etc., guilds like mine that are just gearing up to do it, have been severely handicapped.<P>Please do not lose sight of why we play--its the fun factor.  There is nothing worse or more demoralizing then taking away from a player and his/her guild a hard earned item.  We all must bear responsibility for our mistakes, in game and in real life.  If you made a design mistake, accept it but don't punish those of us that played and play the game fairly.  Do not punish those by using the uber, uber guilds as the standard.  Do not punish those that have put 2 years into a character and now have been so demoralized they are ready to retire their clerics.  Despite what you profess, there are always options other than the extreme ones.  I do not believe your only choice is to make the item useless.  Since you have created the problem, please do not shift the burden upon a class that has struggled and continues to struggle mightily in what is often a very boring role--step up and assume responsiblity and find an equitable solution.  As is, you have penalized a class that has been punished enough, and in the process, every player across each server.<BR>  <BR>Spioctor Quijano<BR>Paladin of the 57th Season<BR>Holy Warrior for Blood Tide<BR>Soluesk Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I've gone along with the nerfs when they were explained.  <P>But I feel at this point I am less needed, less effective, less able to enjoy my gear that I worked for, less able to look forward to new gear, and less able to look forward to new spells... all because EACH and EVERY time we have been given something that we have enjoyed in any small way it has been beaten down into something unusable.<P>*shrug*  Am I being unreasonable?  <P>When they nerfed Donal's it was said that the intent of the BP was to be used only to save clerics downtime, only to be used after fights or rez's.<P>By that definition the PoG BP is working as intended.   A 1500 point heal over time with a 20 sec cast time.  It doesnt work on players under level 47, or on people that are diseased, or on people that are poisoned, or on Necros while they liche.<P>It changes nothing in the dynamics of the game, EXCEPT now we will have to sit longer in between fights, sit longer after rez's, and not be able to do the rare "joy nuke" because we had a little extra mana.  =(</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Verant has 100% forgotten that the GAME is supposed to be FUN. <P>Way back when, Gordon said this should not be a game of numbers. Well, maybe its not supposed to be, but it is. Its on a computer. Its a computer program. The only way to efficiently write the code was to use numbers and algorithms. However, the trick is supposed to be creating code that when PEOPLE use it, they percieve it as being fun for them.<P>For the most part, that was successful. UNTIL you let whoever of doing all the damn nerfs loose on us. All at once, instead of everyone coming for fun, we actually run the game wondering what is going to be nerfed next. Will it be something I spent months getting? Or something my friend spent months getting? Or is it the item I have already spent months working towards, with tons of help from people I have met online?<P>The difference in the amount of healing between a cleric with C2 using CH very efficiently and a cleric with the latest 4 soon-to-be-also-nerfed BPs is VERY VERY VERY minimal. How is that a problem?<P>What really is sad though is that after all these nerfs, we no longer trust Verant. This is nothing short of incompetence. You run the game. You are SUPPOSED to make it FUN for us.<P>YOU HAVE ****** THAT UP GOOD NOW!<P>Congradulations!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sorry Talius, I have never complained of any nerf before, Paladin or otherwise.  In fact, just to set the record straight, no one in my guild had a Donal's BP at the time of that nerf, so I had no basis to make an informed post, one way or another.  So instead of choosing to flame individuals, why not confine your post to the merits or lack thereof of the nerf?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Your attempt at backing this nerf with numbers about healing 400hp every 6 seconds and a mob not losing more than 300hp in that time does not add up in reality. Take one of your lesser ubers like Velkenor for instance. Even with defensive disc on (ignoring the taunt nerf) Velk will still quad around 500. Roughly 2k damage output assuming he is on the warrior (you remember warriors? the class you crippled last nerf?). This bp only helps the fight, it sure as hell does not make it easy or a sure win situation.<P>Beyond all the numbers, the bottom line is this. You claim to have a vision of balanced "risk vs. reward." We TOOK the RISK. We GAINED the REWARD. YOUR lack of forsight is the problem here. You claimed SoV would have Epic Armor when people asked what was left after the epic weapons. Let the clerics have their breastplate.<P>Ahlyah Jhordain<BR>Lotus Cult</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>here's how you fix the exploit and keep the item as-is.<P>1) make the effect celestial healing.<P>OR<P>2) instead of calling it celestial elixir, make it a new spell.  make this spell STOP if the target is at full HP.  sure, there's still room to exploit this in the same way as before, but it gets harder.<P>OR<P>3) make the effect over 48 seconds, rather than 24.  this makes it effectively less regen/second, and something more realistic to allow.  -- do you sacrifice one cleric to get a 150 point per second regen?  you might consider it an exploit, you might consider it strategy.  sure, maybe a constant 300 point regen is a bit much, but halfing it? that might be an acceptable midrage between overpowered and useless.<P>Seranthic T'sarith &lt;Coven Nex&gt;<BR>52 Vicar<BR>Druzzil Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I can't keep reading this thread, it makes me too mad.<P>First off, the effect does in fact make it so that 300hp per tick can be healed?  Isn't this the same as any DD that can cause x number of damage per tick throughout the battle?  A hand held weapon that does x damage per tick throughout the battle?  Why is it that you are balancing the game by making a cleric's utility less and less.  Why not make some changes to some other classes instead of clerics *if*, and only *if* it becomes apparent that a change needs to be made?<P>Second, Zamus is right, he made a number of positive suggestions about things you can do.  Please take a look at them.  ALL of them were on the Class Envy, err, Class Balance Threads that Absor hosted.  Please take a short break from nerfing clerics.  Put MoK back the way it was.  Don't retune Hate and Fear.  Make our core healing spells purchaseable from vendors (Celestial Heal).  Make our spell lines useful (Lull, Yaulp, Holy Armor, etc).  <P>Third, Abashi, you make several points.  You concede teh BP is now worthless?  You concede that the person that came up with the idea is a high level cleric in an "uberguild"?  You attempt to highjack the thread by talking off topic about heal aggro?  In response, the BP is hard to get.  It cost a lot of people time, faction, items handed down, and surely was a makeup bone for the Donal's nerf.  You need to somehow make it right for those folks.  Why are VI employees in "uberguilds"?  Doesn't that smack to anyone else of skewing the orientation of VI employees in favor of "uberguilds"?  Quite frankly, I vastly prefer the small group setting.  Perhaps an effect that was useful in a small group setting?  This is not the place for a discussion of heal aggro.  Except that it demonstrates your complete agreement with your player base that neither the BPs nor the heal aggro changes were tested at all.<P>Why not?  Really.  Why not?  How hard is it to roll out a 60 cleric and a 60 warrior and try to fight Yelinak?  I would think it would take tops a half an hour.  See how it works.  The effect is not unintended.  The BP worked exactly the way you wanted it to.  A cleric at VI said "here is an idea for a BP effect, clerics will really like it".  And they do.  Or more properly, they did.<P>Tarf</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is how you fix this.<P>Change the spell to something equally usefull, but less exploitable. How about a spell like Hero, which gives the same increase in max hp's, but does not give you the hp's. Hence free casting of a very good hp buff, but no exploitation involved. You could do this same thing with Symbol too. Or here is another idea. Leave the Celestial Elixir as is, but give it a buff icon that lasts a given amount of time and lowers your stamina to 0. That way this could not be cast on a player who is in battle, cause well, with 0 stamina you are pretty much useless. It cannot be overwritten by extinquish fatigue. <P>The point is, there are quite a number of things you could add to the spell to still make it worth having without blatently upsetting people. You should have known EXACTLY what you were going to do with this BP before you announced the nerf. The way you handled thing's just frustrated and angered people. Bad decision on your part<P>Another point is if you do this, you better allow ALL clerics to have their PoG faction reset. That is only fair as many of them destroyed their faction simply to get this item.<P>If you are going to "fix" it, then fix it. Don't just nerf it and say "there done". That is the easy way out.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The point that continues to puzzle me is why it is so difficult for Verant to recognize, in advance, when an item or spell is going to be too powerful.  There are a number of items still in the game, and perhaps a small number of spells, which were immediately recognized by players as being too powerful - unbalancing. I am not going to name them as I don't want to get people started, but there were some instances when numerous players made critical comments immediately on introduction of some items.  <P>To continue to do this type of thing and then nerf items after people have invested a lot of time, and perhaps altered their position in the game (faction, handing down or selling items that they replaced, etc.) is unreasonable.  There simply must be more thought and testing before uber items are introduced in the game.<P>Moreover, as many have noted, it is the high end game that's unbalanced now.  Rather than fix that, Verant's approach appears clearly to be continued introduction of more and more powerful items (which, of course, most players will never get), and continued blurring of class distinctions. The high end game simply needs some serious attenton - and I am not speaking only of the parts that affect the uber guilds.  Yet this seems to be about the only thing that gets no attention, and no comment whatsoever, from Verant.  Why is this? </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This post is long.  I don't for a single moment expect Verant to read it -- but before what I see clearly happening to myself and my guild (which is composed primarily of players levels 55 - 60) finishes happening, I would at least like to think I tried.<P>I don't play a high level cleric.  But I have a lot of friends and guildmates who do.  Um, well, I did.  We've barely seen them for weeks.<P>I did a rough calculation last night, that members of our guild have spent more than 900 person-hours in game over the last month doing NOTHING because we didn't have a single cleric online to let us get going.  Once we get even one cleric online, we start it up with whatever we had planned (ratio one cleric for approx. 35 people at times).  We are more limited in what we can do, we die a ton more that way, and have a lot more downtime, but at least we are "playing the game."<P>We've all watched in amazement as casting one Remedy has resulted in total mob lock on the cleric, no matter what anyone else does, until the cleric is dead.  Over and over.<P>Every time we look to see what, if anything, Verant is doing to fix this situation, the answer is the same.  Either vague generalities about unspecified "changes" in how hate will be accumulated, to fix errors made when they were adjusted a few weeks ago, or announcements like the one with which this thread began.<P>For the first time ever our guild members are talking about leaving EQ and what game we can play next.  There's still a lot of things we want to do in EQ, mind you.  We haven't cleared Veeshan's Peak, we haven't been to Sleeper's Tomb, we haven't killed the DN dragon, Velketor, the Vindicator, or a lot of other Velious mobs.  <P>These things were goals for us.  Things we really wanted to do, together, in game.  Nobody was talking about moving on from EQ prior to Verant's actions over the last month, and we had a lot of fun playing together.  <P>Now a huge percentage of our time in-game is spent using EQ as a giant chat room.  A game which already had far too much downtime as a ratio to time spent playing has seen that downtime grow exponentially because of what Verant has done to clerics.  And those mobs which we had our sights on, well, they haven't changed a bit.<P>By the way, not a single one of us is surprised that you nerfed the cleric's abilities/gear without simultaneously re-tuning the mobs that made you decide clerics were unbalanced in the first place.  It has happened before, a lot, and when an explanation is given it's usually that "spell guy" and "mob guy" were on different teams and didn't know what each other was doing, or something similarly unacceptable as an excuse.<P>The answer for what you perceived as an imbalance in how gear effects were impacting the game (it still amazes me that nobody there noticed this when they were giving Velious mobs 200,000 hps to compensate for the players' abilities) was, rather obviously, not to dink around with the heal effects on these items.  Especially while you simultaneously changed hate accumulation, apparently without testing it or with more "mistakes" in how the numbers are coded.  <P>Clerics do three primary things on raids and in xp groups (though since we are really talking about very high level clerics here, the raid situation is far more common).  They buff, they heal, and they rez when it goes bad.  You permitted them to earn, with a lot of effort, an item with the rez effect, which I still think is a very good one.  It allows for manaless rezzing which, for a wonder in this game, REDUCES downtime rather than increasing it (if you didn't realize this... um... forget I said anything).<P>Other high level cleric items, particularly the breastplates, have been implemented with healing effects on them which, accepting your word for it, have had unintended consequences for game balance.  Rather than this constant dinking around with the heal effects on these items, did you give ANY thought to making the effects on these breastplates manaless high level buffs (like aegolism) instead?  They would still be WELL worth having to the players.  They would (gasp) reduce the downtime of waiting for clerics OOM after buffing to med up before the fights, and increase the fun.<P>As long as you made sure that you actually knew the effects of the spells these items cast (whether they also have a slight heal effect for instance), they wouldn't change the balance of high-level combat encounters.  And a totally geared-out high level cleric (of which each of your servers has MAYBE 10?  Out of about 2500 players per server?) could then use their mana, and only the mana they generate, for their third role, healing.<P>Most of the people in my guild, myself included, generally have cut Verant a LOT of slack on issues which have had some players in an uproar.  What you have done to clerics lately, and their resulting reluctance even to play the darned game, has all of us unhappier than we have ever been in Norrath.  If you want us to leave because you just can't balance the high end game to your own satisfaction, why don't you just say so?  Beating the desire to play out of us one "change/adjustment/re-tuning" at a time is unnecessary and leaving a really BAD impression of your company.<P>Thank you for your attention, anyone who actually read this.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Okay, I'm REALLY F'ing pissed at you guys right now, but I am going to *try* to be civil in this post.<P>Despite your claims that someone in Verant plays "a high level cleric in an uber guild" I simply do not believe it.  The *ONLY* thing this BP did was enable us to actually have a little fun in the game during normal experience grindage.  It kept me from having to sit on my ass all the time and actually be able to stand up and hit with my weapon every once in a while.<P>It was rarely usable during large encounters because the casting time was far to long to be effective.  It did lower downtime somewhat, but not enough to matter considering the cleric that ran around BPing people didn't med back his own mana.<P>In effect, what you have done with this NERF is take away ANY ability of the clerics to have FUN.  Perhaps you consider sitting on your ass and medding until the next heal is needed "fun," but I sure as hell do not.<P>Thank you once again for screwing with the FUN of EQ.  You simply do NOT get it . . .<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Paraphrasing the one cleric from my guild with a PoG BP:<P>'It actually makes cleric'ing somewhat fun.'<P>Leave the clerics alone.  They sit, they med, they heal... they exist to make the game enjoyable to us.  And yet every time an item or spell exists that makes their life easier or more fun, it gets nerfed.<P>Your typical well-balanced party pulls non-stop.  This means that the groups cleric is keeping all people healed, buffed, as well as stunning as necessary.  With just his mana.<P>Now, the BP makes this possible in a few places it wasn't before.  So what?  That's good, it gets a few people out of crowded low blue places and hunting tougher game.  Isn't that what high levels with high level gear are supposed to do?<P>We accept a certain amount of risk.  You nerf us, we go somewhere easier where that risk is still at that same amount.  You enhance us, we go somewhere tougher where the risk is still the same.<P>Yes, this bp lets the cleric be the hero.  This bp lets the cleric keep the tanks alive when the healers are OOM.  So what?<P>It's tactics, you know.  You want us to use them, right?  Let me give you an example of tactics:<P>Guild realizes that Treant in PoG tends to hit that which is closest.  Said Treant hits for triple 700's.  Buffed tanks go in.  Once they are beat down to under 2 bubs of health, they back off and get healed, and, yes, the bp is used for this... a single one.  Tank then re-engages.  And this goes on for 5+ minutes.<P>That's tactics.  That's aggro management.  That's players using their abilities to the fullest.  That's players taking down a mob with less of a need of clerics because they don't need to worry about mana as much.  Now, without the bp, your healers go OOM.  Tanks stay in and die.  And you do combat resses.  That's not tactics.  That gimpiness.<P>I prefer tactics.  Leave the BP alone.  Quit nerfing clerics.  And lay off the BIGNERF downgraded to nerf thing.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Abashi, I'd like to show you why the celestial elexir breastplate can not be abused in situations to make 1 warrior be able to kill any mob.<P>The donals bp, yes it was overpowered deny it all ya'd like but 6 of them chain casting would have a warrior ch'd every 5 secnods with NO mana cost and allow them to go from 1 hp to max hitpoints instantly.<P>Celestial Elexir is a high end regen spell, it lasts for a duration of 24 seconds. Therefore the spell cannot be used to instantly rejuvinate a warriors hitpoints and it is only useful in downtime.<P>I'd like to just say Abashi that you really should look at this before you do it, as there are about 20 clerics I know who plan to quit if this change goes through and it just wrecks the over 1 month of time spent in PoG by some guilds for the SOLE purpose of getting PoG bp's.<P>Bandof Ravenheart<BR>59th Myrmidon of Druzzil Ro<BR>&lt;Seekers&gt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

As far as game elements go, there's not much left.  Downtime prohibits me from doing a lot of the things that I would like to do, and now with the cleric changes, the time justification vs. reward isn't worth it.<P>I read the changes that they're proposing in Test in order to reduce cleric aggro, and I'm a little skeptical. Hopefully, it will pan out for the best, however.<P>I don't play a cleric, but for the hard work that they do, they deserve items like these BPs.  Actually, we all deserve better considering the time investment this game requires to proceed at even a snail's pace.<P>One thing I've learned as a level 53 -- you're really no more powerful than you were at level 1 hitting level 1 mobs. Spells & melee abilities change, but it's roughly the same (what a profound statement that was -- sheesh).<P>Where are the rewards for spending this much time and effort?
