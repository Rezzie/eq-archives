</FONT><HR>I came on shortly after release.  Yes crushbone was where the exremely brave went.  There was no begging.  I was level 6 before I understood what a bind or SOW was.  A Ressurection was never heard of except for landing at your bind point after seeing "LOADING PLEASE WAIT".  Blackburrow, and Paw were hot spots, and the Bloodforge hammer was popular.  My most terrifying journey was a daring run from Freeport to Qeynos.  To this day the sounds around Greater Faydark remind me of those time, except now its spammed with auctions and the constant beggars.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I first played EQ when Phase 4 of beta began.  I played a Troll Warrior on Fennin Ro (still do matter of fact).  Us trolls and ogres had an odd relationship back then as we would run around are little dark valley.  Every so often a group of us would band together and try to break into Upper Guk or Cazic and be beaten back silly.  One day as I was strolling out of Grobb I saw the most pecurliar sight.. a little darkskinned man fishing in the swamp!  Whoa a Dark Elf!  Around level level 8 or 9 a group of us travelled to South Ro and were amazed to be out of the gloomy forest.  <P>"Look at the sky!"  <BR>"I see a desert in the distance past this orc army!"<P>After awhile we got curious and since I was the highest level in our group I volunteered to peak over the hill top into the desert and saw... A SANDGIANT!  <P>"RUN!"<P>A few days after that we got up the courage to run across the desert and made it to Oasis of Marr.  We camped the zone line there for awhile and killed a mummy and got a small wooden shield.  We were so excited until we realised Trolls can't quite use it.  So we travelled back to our swamp.<P>A ogre shaman friend of mine (Ningauble!) and myself later on decided we would try to run as fast as we could and see what we could fine beyond Oasis of Marr.  We managed to avoid all the badguys and made it to North Ro.  When we got to the grass area we had our first encounter with other player races, and them with us!  It was pretty funny.  I remember giving a trinket to some pretty wood elf woman who I still run into from time to time today (hey Anni *wave*)<P>That's just a little of the things I experienced the first few weeks playing, the biggest accomplishment we managed during beta was to take down Lockjaw.  But outside of that those feelings of exploring the 'new' were outstanding and meeting new people it was incredible.<P>Many of those I met in beta I still adventure with.  Some I haven't seen in a long long while but are fondly remembered (Banban, Neras).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I remember those days <P><BR>EQ had horrible connection problems the first 7-10 days and everyone bashed UUnet. I remember like day 3 of release and nobody could get on. There was  200-300 people in general chat all whining and complaining and then Smedley logged into chat and first thing he did was spam "Verant SUX!!!!!!!!!!!" and the whole crowd started laughing. Now they tell you to call a 1-800 number who in turn says its your ISP's fault.<P>Anyone remember 90% of all melee being a ranger or a paladin? Everyone had visions of UO tank mages still I think.<P>There was this legendary sword called Ghoulbane in some far off place called Guk. <P>Lower Guk was a thing of rumor.<P>Unrest on the average night had around 70-80 people in it.<P>Cazic-Thule was where you went to get disconnected. Even in the weee hours of the night there was 100 peeps in the zone all trying to get rubicite armor. Anyone still have screenshots of monks wearing rubicite?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>There were no enchanters in the beginning because nobody understood what crowd control meant. The original bread and butter spell for chanters was Whirl til you Hurl and it was nerfed a few months later.<P>Banded and class specific armor didnt' exist. Tanks went from patchwork to bronze to rubicite and then you were uber. <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Bah, we didn't go from Bronze to Rubicite, there was that whole "store bought Steel Plate" phase too...<P>I remember when Tox Forest was filled with the shouts of Rungupp, berating the Erudites. I remember getting blinded SOOOoooo many times, running into the water and dying. I remember going to Qeynos and amassing a small army of level 10's at the gate to help kill him. We all died a few times but finally killed him... heh, guess that was my first raid  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I remember when people would make the run from Freeport to Qeynos to sell derv rings at inflated prices, since the dervish rings dropped _allllll_ the way on the other side of the world.<P>I remember faction hits in Unrest.<P>I remember being the *only* Erudite in Butcherblock for several weeks, and having people come running to see if I was for real - apparently people didn't think you could make the Erudin/Butcherblock at level 5.<P>I remember when spoiler sites involved a listing of rusty through combine weapons, and a crude map of the West Commons drawn in Windows Paint.<P>I remember people flocking around the first person they saw with a surname, asking him if he was a GM.

</FONT><HR>OMG the good ol days! (After the connection nastiness)<P>Yes Derv rings were THE thing back then, no one had seen much of anything magical. A GLS was something people dreamed about (humans mostly). PBB`s went from 150-400pp a shot, seeing my first druid in wolfform (he was so uber) and FBR`s were considered the magi`s top robe.<P>I remember the announcements of the first people hitting 50 and the planes weren`t ready yet and the GM`s assisting in the defeat of the dragons and SolB was THE spot for the high levels to hunt.<P>I remember playing my human mage on innoruuk and hearing a commotion about some necro named Pjzyn who was blocking the way to Surefall.. And getting killed by her pet even though I had mine out.<P>I was so thrilled the first time I had 1pp in my account and giant snake fangs were the best weapon for mage`s around and being in awe of people killing Elite guards in Black Burrow.

</FONT><HR>Heh, gather 'round the fire boys and let me tell you some stories.  <P>I'm nox.  Personal friend to some guys who met the eq designers at E3 back in 1998.  They put my name on a list of '10 folks we should add to beta', and that's how I got into early beta.<P>The game was pretty weird back then, and a lot of extremely odd things happened.  Let me tell you about some of em.<P>Way back when, there were no robes for casters.  Casters could use rapiers, and they could use bucklers.  They could not use staves.  All the casters in the game ran around with little shields and rapiers, it was very lame.  <P>When they first added faction, sometimes strange things would happen.  Once, all of the wisps became agro to humans.  Qeynos hills was a nightmare of unkillable killer wisps chasing newbies around.<P>Once when they were adjusting factions, they adjusted some too far in qeynos...<BR>They made the evil qeynos guards KOS to every good class/race including the good qeynos guards and the npcs.<BR>When we logged in, there was a crowd of about 30 people watching the evil guards fighting the good guards.  It was a huge riot, the guards running all over shouting, the evil guards casting spells, the other npc's joining in.<BR>The mood was festive, people were drinking ale and laughing at the antics.. and then armageddon ensued.  The evil npc's killed all the good npcs, and turned on the crowd in a vicious killing spree.  <BR>People were scrambling over one another to escape qeynos, there were bodies everywhere.  ANyone bound inside qeynos died instantly as they logged in and the gates were a slaughtering house of people trying to run for the hills with a host of shadowknights slaughtering them in one hit.<BR>As a necro, I was spared but the scene was one of mass carnage and insanity.  There were at one point probably 200 player bodies near the pool and shops in north qeynos.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ah, a memory got jogged. I remember in beta, after Ak'Anon was implemented. The Mines were basically a low-level mini-dungeon inside the city, lots of people would hunt in there. No uber-necro guild trainer NPCs to geek the unwary, no invulnerable skeletons. <P>Funny thing is, when I finally came back to EQ in commercial release, I had my 15-ish (at the time) ranger in Steamfont. Went to the bank, decided to go down and check out the ole hunting spot for nostalgia's sake. Peeked in, saw a skellie, cast Snare. WHAM WHAM WHAM as the necro guild trainer decided he didn't like that one little bit. Fortunately he feared me in a direction where I could find my corpse later.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> That was more of a shocker than finding out Kithicor was no longer a happy little newbie zone at night. At least I heard about that one before I went in.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

(yes, people bought weapons from vendors once...)<P>D'Vinn was the finger of Death (quadding for 44's is bad...)<P>Unrest gave a new meaning to terror... getting rooted in the house sucked... hags could charm... nobody went into the basement and lived...<P>MFH had 2 dozen corpses surrounding the Tree...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I started on release day. i remember quite a few things from those days...<P>--there was no music at first, and when they patched it, I heard beautiful music and scary sounds...it made the world truly come alive.<P>--there was no sun or moon in the sky. Then i saw the first sunset on the dock in ButcherBlock and was awed.<P>--i would boast about my Sense Heading skill and get laughed at because the third coordinate of /loc told you everything (i didn't figure that one out).<P>--i saw a gnome caster in BB as a young Paladin and he buffed me...i thought he was a god or something.<P>--i saw a GM standing in the zone near Kaladim and KNEW he was a god, completely decked out in white or silver armor, and I was awestruck.<P>--i saw the wizard spires in GFay and wondered about the mysteries they might hold...so did everyone else.<P>--i received a quest to acquire bone chips and made that my sworn duty as a Paladin to maintain peace in the lands...and i believed it.<P>--i joined in a battle against a giant skeleton on the Chessboard, and won. My party cheered for what seemed like hours, then we sat around and discussed the "meaning" of this chessboard and how it had come to be, and why...and we really wanted to know.<P>--I journeyed to the Ocean of Tears to deliver a card to some blacksmith to complete his deck...and was proud of my accomplishment.<P>--I never dreamed of Uber equipment or the "end-game", never sought to raid Planes or dragons...though taking down a dragon would have been a tale never forgotten. Instead i dreamed of wandering the lands as a master of blacksmithing, a story-teller in taverns, and a fisherman most of the time. I dreamed of walking everywhere I went, only so that it would take longer and i could enjoy things. I dreamed that one day i would only draw steel when someone was in danger and needed my assistance. I dreamed of a game where i could roleplay...where i could become a strong, powerful knight and paladin who defended the weak and protected the innocent. I was the innocent one at that time, but alas, there was no one to protect me from what this has become.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I started when the game first came out.. I remember when i was a troll warrior and me and my group got outta the swamp to sro.  We spent an hours just exploring the grass part.  Then we came to the desert part and were afraid to walk in the desert because we heard a rumor their was quicksand.  I volunteerd to go first and it took me 2hours to cross it and my heart was pounding.  When i got to oasis and saw crocs and SGs i was so scared but i made it to nro.  Noone had ever seen a troll before and people actually thought i was some monster and tried to attack me damn those were the days.  I still remember my first run from qeynos to freeport with my ranger.  It was such an adventure going through the karana's and highpass.  When it got dark and i couldn't see at all because there used to be a bug where you couldn't change the brightness.  When i got to freeport i talked about my grand adventure with my friends.  <BR>           I remember when you could tell if wisps had lightstones or not on them and  i used to spend days on kerra island hunting wisps and filled countless backpacks full of them then i traveled to the other side of the world and sell them for 10pp a piece for GLS's.  I remember when i had banded and 2combine longswords and people thought i was a god.  People were so much more friendly back then and always helped and the GMs always helped everyone and won't power tripping asses like they are now.  I remember when people said there were pirates and when i took a boat i was all scared and made a group on the boat incase pirates attacked.  My first time in befallen was one of the most fun things.  When i had my monk and grouped in befallen i was really curious and wanted to see what was down the well i  jumped down and got swarmed on.  I lost my corpse but i had a fun time.  I still remmeber my first raid on lockjaw there was an army of level 14s and 15s attacking him lotsa of us died but we finally took him down and my monk got the LJ tunic.  I thought i was a god.  Other good memories i have are when my warrior first got his last name and a gm came and congratulated me and announced it to the whole server or when i first got crafted i got like 500tells that day people telling me congrats and asking how i got it.  Then the big debate on how easy it was for warriors to get uber armor.. That was back when we didn't even have critical hits stuns and half as many hps and all that other stuff warriors got now.  It makes me sad to think how great this game once was and how greed has made a once great game of adventure and roll playing turn into a game about phat lewt uber guilds and who is camping what.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I remember in phase 4 beta, finally buying my first bow(hunting bow) for my level 5 ranger, and the first arrow i fired was at a wolf. Damndest thing to, a guard walked in the path as I saw the arrow go curving toward the wolf and the damn arrow hit the guard and of course, WAM! <P>I remember trying to get to halas from greater faydark because i wanted to see the snow, and finally finding my way up the hill in kithicor to the Highpass hold zone line, where people in wonderful armor were all hudeled around casting powerful magic on each other. I zoned into highpass hold and an orc fanatic came and hit me for around 30, I immediatly ran back out of the zone and ran all the way back to the commons, where I shared my tail of super orcs to the zone.<P>I remember giving a rusty dagger to someone going to get his corpse becasue i thought "He could use it to defend himself if attacked again".<P>I thought my tarnished bastard sword was all powerful.<P>Dvinn was the most feared mob I knew of, and I was actually kinda scared of him.<P>I threw CB belts down because they weighed to much, and were good for nothing.<P>My fondest memory is one im not proud of, when I first hit 15 with my ranger and got camo spell. I had found mistmoore at a much younger age and decided I could go to Mistmoore with camo and explore. So I went there naked, and found a few groups hunting, i would stand around camo, wait for them to kill something, then if no one looted, i would madly start right clicking,<P>You may not loot this corpse at this time<BR>you may not loot this corpse at this time<BR>you may not loot this corpse at this time<P>Until I would loot, I called it grave robbing <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I remember hunting mino's and how people used to tell horror stories of the dreaded mino hero and if anyone even said anything about the mino hero comming we would all run for our lives.  I loved when voice graft used to work on NPCs.  Id have the guards talk to eachother and to people by freeport gates.  All the magic is gone from EQ.  You can still get alittle when a new server comes out and everyone is actually having fun again and not worrying about phat lewt or camping.  I hope the new games that come out are close to as good as EQ was the first 6months of beta/release.  EQ is gonna be a tough game to beat.  Hopefully they will learn from UO/EQ's mistakes and not repeat them.  But when any game gets back they lose sight of their original goals and in the end it is all about money.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I remember sharpening my Rusty 2h with sharpening stones from a far away place called Freeport and spending all my money for some so I could sharpen my weapon.  I remember running from Qeynos to Rivervale to fight in Misty Thicket and a Troll Shaman stopped what she was doing to guild me at lvl 9 thru EK to MT...I remember running like hell when Mooto came after me.  I remember the big hoopla about being able to buy Magical weapons from Gypsies in far off lands and people selling them for 100pp in GF...I remember when D'vinn used to Rule CB...I remember the first time I ran by Kizdean Gix and he feared me and whooped my arse...I remember falling off the boat going from BB to FP and getting killed by a shark and a GM recovering my corpse for me.  I remember when the Coveted Banded and Bi armor starting coming about. Hell I could go on and on...But the one thing that stands out in my mind is:  That Fateful Night on Halloween of the First Undead Invasion....When Warbones Tromped around killing everyone...gangs of people slashing their rustys trying to kill them...we ran for the Surefall ent..completely sure we were safe hiding in the cave...then seeing Varsoon Hits you for 35 points of Damage!!! a few times and DEAD...Loading Please Wait!...HAR...That was the coolest thing ever...Oh and when everyone was running around screaming that Giant Turkeys were invading....that was the first Thanksgiving...hehe...my 2cp..<P>I REALLY USED TO LOVE THIS GAME:<P>Who could forget the feeling of Majesty, wonder, and fear the first time the started up the HP Ramp in EK....and was I going nuts or do I remember things riding the giant spiders in EK?....I was so filled with wonder, I would drool only myself...Im the ultimate RPG fan and only 25 years old...But yet i have played such favorites as Paper D&D and Bard's Tale III on commodore 64...This was and still has the most potential for the greatest game ever...AND WHAT IN THE HELL POSSESSED THEM TO TAKE THE ABILITY of A BUNCH OF LOW LEVELS TO ATTACK A LVL 20 CREATURE and kill it....IT MAKES NO SENSE...only a group or the person with the most dmg would get the exp..WHY do this...That took a great deal out of the game...oh well my 2cp..<P>Magkul Flametwister&lt;Freedom Fighters&gt;<BR>formerly Magklyduhlicios Lookycharms<BR>36 Mage (and many more)<BR>Brell...<P>2 years long and still going strong...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>LOL I remember the total uproar over the introduction of Gynok Moltar in Befallen. He was the uber mob back then, designed to keep people from being safe and resting merrily at the zoneline. It was a major discussion over how Verant just wanted to kill everyone. LOL<P>The various NPCs in Innothule swamp were also another discussion along the same lines.<P>Nobody called anyone a newbie because we were all in a sense, newbies. <P>Kedge Keep existed, but there were no mobs in it at all. <P>Combine Longswords were every Rangers dream weapon.<P>Sand Giants seemed much bigger, and seemed to pop up near you more often.<P>There used to be "safe areas" at zonelines. So you could run from a mob up to the zoneline and stop just before zoning in, the mob would turn and go the other way. <P>Brad stopped by chat quite often.<P>Verant was then known as 989, then Red Eye, then became Verant. <P>I got a rez from a GM because I fell for 10,000 points of damage in OOT and couldnt find my corpse. Couldnt figure out why the sky was under me, and all the graphics seemed to trail if I looked around. heh heh Got the rez, no questions asked.<P>Mistmoore and Unrest were the places to be. A Mistmoore shield was a god item and people would crowd around to see anyone with one. <P>Ahh, the good old days.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>hmm...lemme see, I remember impromptu games of tag in misty thicket &lt;grin&gt;.  A lvl 14 necromancer proclaiming that he could, in fact, become a deputy in rivervale.  I remember when no one knew what harmony or dance of the fireflies did, and dance of the fireflies could be cast any time you wanted.  I remember guiding people from misty to qeynos, people asking where you were when you /shouted for help.  I remember when I fell off the boat in OOT and thought i could zone in one of the little row-boats =P.  I remember when north ro actualy had sand giants in it, and a there was a rumor that rogues could pickpocket alot of money from them if they could just run fast enough to escape.  I remember when there was just one boat running between freeport and BB and ports were just unthinkable because no one had them yet.  I remember hearing about spirit of wolf and wondering what it actualy did.  I remember the days before quad kiting and thinking that kiting would never catch on &lt;sigh&gt;.  I remember when Kizdean Gix was a necromancer and dragoon zytl was a shadowknight.  I remember when there was always 2 giants wandering the desert in west commons and I remember thinking they'd never see me if I was in one of the houses.  I remember selling every scrap of armour on me just so I could buy annother spell. &lt;sigh&gt; those were the days.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First day of EQ live:  Packet loss 10-20%, server down, and complaining on a massive scale in the chat room (actually it was sort of funny to read the various remarks that people made).  Of course, it did get better, but you asked about the early days.

</FONT><HR>Hmm...I started on Bertox the day it opened. I must have messed around with 4 or 5 characters before I started my Barbarian Warrior. I didn't want to be bothered with spells since playing a warrior was "so complicated."<P>Lost her down the tree hole in BB at level 5, with most of a suit of patchwork. I was so mad I didn't play for 2 weeks. Then when I started playing again, I killed spiderlings and white wolves with my BARE HANDS until I had enough money to buy a rusty dagger.<P>I was really amazed at how short humans were the first time I saw them.<P>The first time I saw a gnome, he rp'd the story of his journey to Halas to me while sitting on the counter in the bank. I heard about massive plains, rampaging giant eyes, cyclops...hehe.<P>I lost my most prized possession, a rusty halberd, trying to sharpen it.<P>I was a member of the first guild formed in the Everfrost area and got dozens of tells asking me how I got the words after my name.<P>When the first humans came to Everfrost they were mostly wizards, and we didn't see what possible use they could be because when we yelled at them for a heal they said they couldn't. <P>There were as many Barbarian rogues as there were warriors.<P>When I started my first alternate character, a High Elf mage, there was this oddity where you'd be out in the middle of GFay and the city of Felwithe would just come floating by. Periodically you'd hear shouts about Felwithe flattening people and then they'd realize it didn't do any damage, but boy it was impressive to get an entire city in the face.<P>Okay, I'll stop now.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
