I hate tryin to sell things in Nfp and having a couple of FoH (and maybe one or two other higher levels non FoH) demean and belittle people for the prices they post. You can sell for what you want, FoH doesnt make up the price.

</FONT><HR>Hmm I don't know who in FoH you ran into but seems you have a prob with 1 or 2 people in FoH.  FoH is a guild.  If 1 or 2 people bug you that is no reason to judge the whole guild.  <BR>I personally never hang out in NFP.  I don't sell/buy/trade in game.  If I need something I go try to get in a group and camp it. If I have something I don't need I pass it down to my other characters or to some one who can use it.  Actually I give lots of stuff to my lower lvl characters to give away to lower lvl people I group with.  This week my lvl 10 paladin did the Testimony of Truth quest.  A lvl 9 Shaman and 14 Warrior helped me.  Never met them before but they helped and stayed with me to the end of the quest.  Well I asked them to come to the bank because I wanted to thank them for their help.  The Shaman left with a Ogre War Maul.  The warrior with a Shield of the Slain Unicorn.  Yesterday I was killing Orcs in East commons. A Cleric in group was doing a very nice job and was keeping me alive.  He was in leather armor.  I had a pair of Bronze greeves and Bronze BP that had just passed down to my Paly.  I gave the Cleric them both for a job well done. <BR>I along with many other FoH members do this sort of stuff on a regular bases with our lower lvl characters.  Sadly the few people who have ever had a bad run in with FoH come spewing out. While the tons more who have had good experience's play the game and don't take the time to come here.<BR>FoH doesn't hang out in NFP hollaring **** out.  Maybe you auctioned something and they asked how much and thought your price was riduculas to them and said so.  Don't take things so personel is all I can say.  I have never heard one of our members in NFP shouting out how unfair people prices are. Not saying it didnt happen, but if you think that this is what FoH is then you are very wrong.<P>Stridar Swiftstrike<BR>Fires of Heaven<BR>Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ok quilty by assocation. So for all the nice things I do and all the items I give away my whole guild is quilty of that?<BR>We all take credit for when 1 member cast sow and some buffs on another character?  When one of our lvl 50 clerics gives some guy he has never seen before a full res then all the guild should get the thanks?  Should it not work both ways?  <P>No, when one member is in a bad mood one day and after he logs on and the 50th person gives him a tell asking for his Kick ass weapon he got from a God.  He gives a smart ass remark, which is later put up on a msg board for all to see how awfull FoH members are.  Even though he answered the first 50 and the next 50 tells nice and polite.  Those don't get seen, only that 1 bad responce will.<P>This people don't see or care about.  We are FoH, you all have always heard how bad we are.  You've never expiernced it, but you believe it.  I personally get a tell about every 20 minutes from people I have never seen or heard of.  Asking anything from what am I doing, what am I wearing, what am I killing, what am I killing it with, what would I wear or use at this lvl if I was so and so race/class.  I always answer to the best of my knowledge even if I am about to die getting beat down by 3 imps in solb, cause I know if I don't then I'll see yet another post on how big of a dick some one in FOH was.  <BR>Just yesterday I got a tell from a guy asking if I had Ivy etched leggins on(the Ranger quest armor).  I said yes and he asked if I wanted to sell or trade em.  I told him they were the only pants I had but of course if the trade was something I really needed I might consider trading.  Well he had a lambent Breastplate(Bard quest armor).  I told him sorry I had no bard and I couldn't use it.  He then got mad and said well I could easily sell the BP or trade it for another pair of legs.  Asked why he didn't do that then if it was that easy and he said he didnt have the time.  Then he started cussing me and saying how true it is that all of FoH is full of assholes.  Hmm I missed something. I was supposed to trade something I camped for 3 days  to get while getting no exp the whole time for something I had no use for.  Since I didn't I'm a ass.  <P>This is the sort of stuff we in FoH put up with daily.  This is the sort of people that get pissed and go and post on these boards about how bad we are.  I am a player playing EQ just like you, I do it with some very good players that are also playing EQ just like you and I.  <P>Stridar Swiftstrike<BR>Fires of Heaven<BR>Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>That is a little different.  These are things you SHOULD be doing.  These are things expected by ALL players.  With maybe hte exception of giving things away.<P>If you have SoW and someone needs it, buff them with it.  If someone needs a Res and you are there or willing to help, then Res them.  If someone needs equipment and you have some to spare and are compelled to do so, give it to them.  These are all reasonable things people SHOULD be doing.  Hey, I never killed anyone in real life, does that make me a good guy?  Not necessarily, because this is something that is EXPECTED of me, not to kill someone (IRL).<P>BUT when you do something such as Kill Steal, train people or any other negative act you are accused of doing.  Well this isn't the norm, it is NOT expected behavior NOR is it acceptable.  This is what makes you guilty.  And if you harbor such individuals in your guild, then what does that tell people about the guild?  It tells them that you don't give a flying f**k what people do in your guild.<P>So what, maybe YOU are nice in character and maybe YOU have never done anything wrong.  But perhaps the people you roll with have.  So their negativity will only reflect on you.<P>I have experienced FIRST HAND the favortism the GMs show to you, the kill stealing, the mockery.  This is why I left Veeshan (that and the population issues.).  I still have characters there I play with from time to time.  I still have friends on Veeshan too.  This is why I am posting, I guess to keep up with current events.  Too bad that you guys haven't changed for the better.  Maybe when the "next best game" comes out you will all move on and leave the "core fans" of EverQuest in peace.  So that they can finally start to work together with one another instead of against each other, or should I say, against your guild.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>   I would personally like to stay out of the conflict as best a posible but while I am here I think there should be a reality check by someone who can look at things from an unbiased view. I am new to EQ and am on the lower level of things and of course due to rumors am imtimidated by FOH. I have only had interaction with one of their members and i was buffed. As someone who has never had any prolonged contact with and FOH member I feel that it is not my place to pass judgement on them. I feel that the rest of you should do the same. Unless you have been screwed over consistantly by FOH you do not hold the right to critisize them. Of course people make them out to be jerks because when someone one does something rude it sticks our more than when someone does soemthing nice. That is to say that for one guy being a jerk it will take 10 guys being nice to remove the damge it has done to the reputation of whatever party was involved. So now if FOH has one or two jerks runnign aroudn which I would know nothing about then it will take many more acts of kindness before someone give FOH credit for being nice. I try to look at everyone on an indivisual basis anstead on a colective level. I would suggest everyone trys to do the same, it will make Veesahn and happier and better server. I do expect that those who complain the most are of younger age though and are for the most part imature. I can make this generalization because i am of that age group. SO what I am trying to say is pass jugement on indivisuals not the guild they belong to. Maybe if people are nicer to FOH you may discover that they too can be nice. I personally wouldn't want to be a member of the guild till their reputation has been repaired but in oder for that to happen the people of Veeshan must become less critical, more openminded, and start looking at things as a resonable person. No I am not defending the guild I am just telling you people to start acting like resonable indivisuals, that is all I have to say.<BR>Level 15 Mage, Level 17 Paladin Veeshan<BR>(Nope you aren't gonna get to find out my character name.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The members of FoH that I have met in my travels have been very kind to me. My guess is that while there are a  few "conceited jerks" in FoH, the way someone approaches them is how the reactions is determined. If someone goes up to them begging to be twinked, or asking for the next spawn when they've been waiting a few days for it, they get annoyed. They are people too. FoH is a guild just like all other guilds on Veeshan. It has people who are very kind, as well as jerks that give it a bad name. It probably has alot of people in the middle of these who are typically nice to others, but act out aggressions they have in EQ. I really wish that those who complain about FoH would realize that they have probably acted in the exact same ways that pissed them off. I take all reactions in the game with a grain of salt, only passing judgement on jerks if they are consistantly jerks. I, just like everyone else, can have a bad day and react differently than I normally do. That doesn't make me a jerk, just as people having a bad day, and taking it out on everyone else doesn't make members of FoH jerks. I agree that they are a very organized guild, filled with excellent players, but they are not the most important thing on Norrath, which many players seem to think. FoH is just more players, treat them how you would like to be treated on the server and everyone will have alot more fun.<BR> I am in no way affiliated with the Fires of Heaven guild, and am not a "Beta Player". I hope that these words will not be seen as FoH promotion, but as a truth that exists beyond tags.<BR> Someday those of you who complain now will be in the shoes of FoH. Treat them as you would want to be treated.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I am sure to get flamed for this but who cares. I have met some pretty nice people in FoH. I have onoly heard of the not so nice. I also have met some really nice people across veeshan in alot of guilds. I have also met alot of people who act like jerks no matter what affiliation they have. Come on people its just like RL. Get over it. I have a good analogy and if you say you didnt feel this way then you are full of crap and a liar. eheh My analogy is this....In the 80s..Michael Jackson was a super star. He sold million and millions of records. He had millions and millions of fans. Yet everybody i grew up with or talked to in school or whatever claimed they hated him and he sucked. And i know for a fact too that all those people that bashed michael jackson had his records. eheh Anyways what i am trying to say is that there is a price to pay for popularity. People get so envious and jealous of what other people have achieved so this is the way they have to react. Now look i am only a level 30 cleric, and i would love to be in a foh members shoes too. However, I dont bash them or think they are jerks just cause they are FOH. I dont understand why people have to waste their time with flaming and complaining about them. Put that anger against yourself or whatever into getting yourself that level 50 and those items you want. There are bad people everywhere..that doesnt mean becuase they have the FoH tag over their head they are arseholes.....just friggin deal with it and move on.<P>Kudos to all the good people on Veeshan....whether they are FOH or not.<P><BR>Skunki Goldenheal<BR>Guardians Of Veeshan<BR>30th Cleric of Marr<BR>Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Someone needed to do a quest, and asked very nicley, over the ooc, and even when to them and ask through say.  All the responce he got  was no, and they killed him everytime.  Furthermore they kept taunting him about the spawn.  I am not saying this goes for all FoH, but these guys acted like they were 12 years old, and there mommies never taught them to share.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ok Stridar <P>I do applaud the defense of your guild.  Few of you have any legs to stand on when it comes to this.  I have never personally run across you in game, but my assumptions about FoH come from the following FoH players.<P>Alloria - Has taken kills from me that were worth no experience to herself.  Note that the first one was as she had ported into a zone then proceeded to wrath a griffon twice.<P>Azian - On more than one occasion has killed SGs from groups I was in.  His favorite hangout was Cazic Thule where he was widely known as a Rubicite farmer.<BR>Bartab - See Senir.<BR>Creediki - Again due mostly to his arrogance over the contest of wills not long ago with CT and Lady D over a supposed KS of Naggy.<P>Furor - Arrogance.<BR>Juul - KS'd the Oracle<BR>Kartak - See Furor<BR>Kalaran - See Furor<BR>Nether - Intentionally trained my group out of a room in Guk, supported by Karanis.<BR>Senir - Likely the worst of the bunch.<P>I'd be remiss to not say the following:<BR>Both the Azain and Alloria episodes happend last summer as such I've not had issues with them beyond this time.<P>Genjuro - Has been 1 of 2 people in Fires of Heaven that I have met that has been pleasant.  I regret at this point that I'm unable to remember the second.<P>Ragnarok - Has been both a boon and blessing.  Once taking kills and once helping me with something I couldn't have done on my own.  So I include him among the positives.<P>As such the negative contact with your guild has FAR outweighed the positive conact with your guild.  This is where the majority of the where the perceptions of FoH lie.  Most are based on actual event, couple that with rumor, and the bake in the presence of Arrogance and you have the cake that FoH has baked.<P>Its a cake of your own (FoH's) making, suck it up eat it and move on or change the recipe.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I like FOH! I hear people all the time bash them about exploits, rudeness ect.... I have not encountered a rude FOH player. Even if I did who cares. If another player is rude, big frickin deal! I respect their accomplishments. Everyone can have a bad day and lash out at someone. The problem is people in this game are far too sensitive and always take things the wrong way. <P>When I think of true adventuring, I think of FOH. There is no doubt that they are the dopest guild on our server (not sure about other servers). they are the first to do everything, they pioneer, and pave the way for the rest of you who whine about them. I hope FOH keeps doing what they have, I reading about your adventures!!!!<P>Giny Windsong <BR>46 Paladin<BR>veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I regret at this point that I'm unable to remember the second.<P>Juul - KS'd the Oracle<P>Considering that I, Juul, am Genjuro's RL girlfriend and play the game sitting exactly 1 foot from him, and we very rarely go anywhere without each other, I sense a discrepancy.<P>I do not remember ever KS'ing an Oracle spawn.  I have an Oracle robe, on my newbie, that I got when I was camping jboots in OOT one day, and no one in the zone was high enough to take him down.  As soon as I did, everyone in the zone wanted to /random for the robe, but I can atest that there was NO ONE other than myself on that island.<P>That is the only time I have ever been alone on Oracle Island - *IF* I ever ks'd from you (which I doubt, as I've been involved in killing the oracle maybe 3 times since I started playing back May), then Genjuro would have been there too.  I find it far more likely that I was too busy to res you in Mistmoore while I was in the Plane of Sky, or similar nonesense.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I had to post here, couldnt resist.  My general opinion of FoH is GOOD.  I have only one really big black eye against them.  The first CT naggy run.  FoH showed up and was bashing the hell out of them.  Deagarmo came in and FoH insisted on bashing them again.  I have the logs, I have the screenshots I was there. Other than that I have no beef against FoH.  There are many many nice people in it.  And some that are really arogant stuck up a$$holes that I avoid like the plague.  They are a powerful guild and know how to get things done.  I had a small feeling they dont like to share dragons and planes.  But it looks like they have learned to share.  So my outlook on the guild itself is GOOD.  Just wish FoH would weed out the a$$holes.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Stridar if you have any power in this guild i suggest you read the boards, find out, who is causing problems and get rid of those players or atleast watch them closely. ONE person can ruin a guild's rep(i would know Dalover ruined ours).  And it seems that since soo many people dislike or even hate you all that you made need to watch or "fire" many poeple( or would this make you less powerful) =)...Seriously bud, i know there are soo many people in your guild that you dont have to worry what others say(which is stuck up and "jerkish"), but you gotta change some of you guild ways. its horrid, stand having so many people say all this **** about you and your guild.<P>I know you need items and stuff, but i tihnk id even quit this guild myself if i were you</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum31&number=31&thisthread=000123&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum31&number=31&thisthread=000123&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
