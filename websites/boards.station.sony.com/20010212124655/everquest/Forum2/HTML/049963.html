&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Well let me just start off by saying that I've played this class multiple times past level 55.<P>Once, to level 55, and once, to level 58.<P>Both monks have been in capable raiding guilds, and have seen many great things in being a monk, but often times, feel - why not just roll up a warrior or a rogue?<P>-- Why are monks so imbalanced? --<P>Well lets begin by taking a look at all of the other classes at hand.<P>Rogues - They hands down, do the most damage out of any class in the game.  Circumstantial or not, they sit behind mobs and often get backstabs for over 700+ damage, quite commonly, a double backstab.  Against all of the uberspawns, they have the most dependable form of kicking their aggro - evade.  This skill allows them never to dodge out of combat to lose potential damage, and they stay in battle until the mob is dead, or the warrior dies.  Rogues are now needed to pick locks, sense traps, and make corpse retreival look easy in many zones.  So what else?  Rogues, can debateably tank as well as a monk can, while dishing out two times as much damage in the same period of time.  Their utility? - damage, corpse retreival, picking locks, and sensing traps.<P>Warriors - Well, they've come a long way from pre-kunark days, up until now.  This class is capable of obtaining the most AC out of any class, the most hitpoints, and with their discpline defensive, which allows them to absorb only 75% of the damage taken, for a period of 2-3 minutes.  While this discipline recycles every 10 minutes, warriors are in defensive, say 30% of the time.  This allows them to be the most efficient utilizers of complete heal.  In addition, warriors are also able to withstand the most damage, and still live.  They do not need a means of avoiding aggro, because that is their sole intention - to keep aggro'd on to a mob.  Well, what else do this 1300 AC, 4000 hitpoint meat shields do other than absorb damage?  Lets talk about dealing damage.  A warrior, persay using some average weapons - willsapper, and a scimmy of lifestealing.  If you want logged combat parses, I can show you.  But heres my beef, warriors can do just as much damage, if not more, than a monk.  I know this is intentional to keep the aggro on to a warrior, however, how is this supposed to allow monks to hold thier own as a class?<P>--- Monks, as opposed to rogues and warriors ---<P>Monks were deemed "the masters of melee combat."  As mentioned, I felt this was quite a nice occupation to hold, and that doing some harsh melee damage would make this a viable class to choose.<P>PREKUNARK MONKS<P>We were the coolest class.  Hands down, we did the most melee damage, took damage well, and had our occupations cut out for us.  Hasted, dual wielding whitened treant fists, we were beasts.  We were monsters, and we withought any doubt in anyone's mind, did more damage than a warrior.  Rogues did comparable damage, which is how I felt it always should have been.<P>KUNARK<P>With the implementation of kunark, monks got the shaft as warriors received a higher defense cap (245) and armor that knocked the socks off of anything a monk could wear.  (i.e. cobalt vs.. ?).  Not only did monks get no new pieces of class based armour, but we received only a few pieces of all/all armor that just doesn't exactly cut it in the utility / AC department.  Rogues received mrylokars armor, which allowed them to obtain a higher AC than a monk, and well warriors receiving cobalt made much sense, because they take the damage as opposed to dish it.  How did warriors get so close to monks in damage?<P>Two things : <P>Lamentation<BR>Jade mace<P>With these two items, a warrior's damage output became close, if not equal to a monk's.<P>FEIGN DEATH<P>There was an obvious implementation of a new aggregation for mobs.  Monsters would react differently to feign death, and feign death no longer became a means of killing your aggro mid-combat.<P>When I fought a mob known as treah greenroot, in the plane of growth, I noticed this new aggro implementation ten-fold.  Obviously there is a certain point of aggro in which feign death will become useless.  About two minutes into combat, while the warriors, rogues, and magician pets were still going strong, pounding away, I was frantically trying to get distance from the mob (almost out of view) and trying to feign.  Shortly afterwards, I was summoned, and kapow, hit for two rounds of 700 damage.  My cleric heals me, and I try and feign again.  This only seemingly increases my aggro.<P>Level pulling became the new hype, and monks became useless for splitting mobs in any given situation.  So if feign death becomes completely useless, what are monks, besides tanks that deal as much damage as a warrior, and tank worse than a warrior?<P>Weren't monks supposed to be the masters of dual wield?  So we were given only 7 more points of dual wield skill and equal weapon skill to that of a rogue?<P>VELIOUS<P>There is no stopping anything with this expansion.  While not every piece in the game has been found yet, a good portion of velious has been unveiled.  The loot, was obviously impressive.  Revealing items that outdo the epic items (obviously, thank you for this...) and have statistics that blow them away (gauntlets of dragonslaying vs. celestial fists to name one).  With this expansion out, the arsenal of weapons warriors are allowed to select only allows them to deal MORE damage than a monk (willsapper, for instance).<P>So to sum up all of the points i've made in my post...<P>Rogues - Best damage dealers, tank like monks.<P>Warriors - good damage dealers, tank like tanks.<P>Monks - good damage dealers, tank like rogues.  feign death does not work in many given situations.<P>So while our damage is only better than warriors by a SLIGHT noticeable margin, and while our damage is pathetic in comparison to a rogues...<P>So while our tanking ability is only better than rogues by a SLIGHT noticeable margin, and while our tanking ability is quite pathetic in comparison to a warrior...<P>So while our feign death ability is completely useless, and only good for crawling through a zone and feigning off green mobs, while the warriors just plow through with their massive hitpoints, and rogues just plow through with their sneak / hide ability that runs at regular speed 51+...<P>So while we try and dish out our damage, as the rogues plow away evading and backstabbing their hearts out, and while warriors stand their taking the blows with their defensive discipline and dishing out the damage like champs...<P>the MONK is sitting back, over-aggro'd to hell, trying to feign off the mob and kick him/herself down the aggro list down a few notches, LOSING MANY, MANY rounds of combat (1000's of damage, potentially)...<P>PLEASE tell me there is some sort of fix in the works?<P>For instance :<P>-More hitpoints for monks<BR>-Changing the aggro of mobs, so feign works<BR>-Giving monks an "evade" type of skill<BR>-Possibly raising the 1HB, dual wield, H2H, and innate ATK of monks<BR>-Possibly raising defense for monks past 252 (i know this is a game flaw, and it isn't possible... however, mobs with more than 32,000 hitpoints weren't possible, either... right?)<P>Whatever it is, I really feel, that monks deserve more than to be a class that is :<P>you guessed it...<P>able to tank 10% better than a rogue<BR>able to deal damage 10% better than a tank.<P>We're not just in the middle, we're towards the bottom.<P>PLEASE, consider my pleas, and give this class something to make them once again - the masters of melee combat.<P>Ashek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Can someone please tell me why when we get out damaged out tanked by wars and rogues we have a weight limit too.  I mean this lets me carry nothing, not even good loot of a mob nothing at all.  If your not going to make it our full str, than at least increase it to 20 or so, that would be a little better :P</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Curious about this one too Ashek.  I recently started a monk to have something to play on raids, but now I'm not so sure I made the right choice.  It's been great fun up to 17, but I can't see what I'll add at high level if warriors do the same damage and feign doesn't work.  Rogues have gone from being as blasted as Rangers to the flavor of the day with the release of Velious.  Wonder if it's time to reroll.  I'll be watching the "what do monks want" forum when Absor posts it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>While I don't fully agree with all of ashek's points, I do agree with the rogue damage argument.<P>Monks are supposed to be the masters of melee. However, at the levels where this damage output is really noticeable, rogues easily outdamage monks without much effort. While rogues are entirely equipment dependant, it's not terribly difficult to equip a rogue in such a way as to outdamage an equal leveled, similarly equipped monk.<P>Even with Celestial Fists, monks don't outdamage the rogue with his Ragebringer and whatever he has in his other hand.<P>However, I also don't think that nerfing rogues, or beefing monks is the answer. My thought is that there should be more weapons available in game that are monk useable that would help to increase damage output.<P>Oh, can I have 10p too?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I believe that monks' damage should be nearer to rogues' (as rogues do insane damage and dont get beaten on). And further from warriors (as they can do big damage and tank V well).<P><BR>Monks taunt too much with their attacks.. so simply doing something to increase damage would make them even more of a mana sponge.<P><BR>I think that monks should get: <P>1. A new special attack that has a higher minimum and maximum than Flying Kick. Also this attack could have a slight untaunt (to offset a bit of the monks melee taunt).<P>2. FD should work against Uber mobs<P>_______________________________________________<P>If you disagree..please look at the following points:<P>1.How would the rogues feel if an expansion came out that gave warriors skills and equipment that could very nearly match your own damage output.. whilst they also become noticably better tanks than they already were? That is EXACTLY what happened to monks.<P><BR>2. Everyone has had improved weapons and specials since Kunark. Before then Flying Kick was a nice weapon in the monks arsenal. HOWEVER .. despite the fact that everyone have weapons that CLOSE the gap on monks, they are still stuck with the same OBSOLETE special that they received at level 30 two expansions ago. <P><BR>3. The classes that were considered overpowered prior to Kunark:<P>Necros, Magicians and Monks.. seem to be the ones that Verant are the least willing to support. This is despite the fact that many of the other classes have been buffed up to extrodinary performance since then (esp. pure melee).<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One thing I wish happened in the post-50 game was for all the monk specials to evolve. Instead we got one-shot disciplines. Here's what I would have liked to see:<P>Kick becomes MultiKick - As the name implies, launches a barrage of kicks. Actual number of kicks is random, so it has a chance of being highly damaging or highly pathetic.<P>Round Kick becomes Tornado Kick - An AoE attack that effects all enemies in melee range.<P>Tiger Claw becomes ???? - I dunno, any ideas?<P>Eagle Strike becomes Ashen Hand - Same as discipline, but doesn't do quite as much damage. Has a chance of insta-killing opponents Lv.45 or under.<P>Dragon Punch becomes Silent Fist - Same as discipline, but doesn't do quite as much damage. Has a fairly good chance to stun.<P>Flying Kick becomes Thunderkick - Not the same as the discipline. Minimum damage cap added. Has a chance of inflicting an AC debuff on the target.<P>All evolved specials will have their damage amounts increased accordingly, of course. New animations and maybe even some particle effects are a must. Not only does this give our utility a HUGE boost, it'll increase our coolness factor tenfold.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, I won't mention tanking compared to warriors, but i was in group at lvl 52 with a palidin in sebilis, I wear a lot of hp equipment to compensate for the lack of hp a monk usually has (appx 400 hp worth of hp gear) and the paladin fully buffed had about 400 hp more than me.  In a fight where the paladin was tanking versus me, he would usually get complete healed once, the paladin went afk a few mins and something spawned, so i was tanking the entire fight versus the rogue, and i had to get two complete heals, that said something to me about ability to tank...<P>I've got a level 46 rogue friend, he tells me "i'm going to go solo now" so off he goes to sol b to solo.  His weapons are trak tooth 10/20 and off hand a 10/21 weapon compare that to monk weapons, just given ratio, rogues do as much damage toe to toe as a monk, put them behind something and you have them doing SIGNIFICANTLY more damage.<P>Things I'd like to see, 1 is fists buffed up, in the BoTB monks aren't allowed to use weapons, but somehow we're expected to use weapons in day to day to compete with damage *** is all that?  I played for about a year before kunark came out, i enjoyed playing without weapons and still do, though i do play with weapons some.  2 put the h2h skill equal pre 50 to 1hb, verus the post 50 skill improves like it is now to reach caps.  3 make block more effective for deffense.  4 some sort of evade would certainly be nice, when i'm laying on the ground so the warrior can tank, it sure puts a damper on my damage output, hey look there went 3 rounds where warrior outdamaged me by 100% i bet my melee damage isn't 10% above his anymore. 5, hp buffs would be nice for those times i have to tank, which i used to do pre kunark seemingly fine.  Just a few ideas, I don't know why monks are treated like hybrids without the second class benefits.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have to agree here.  I remember when monks were "the" must have in the harders dungeons (pre kunark) and even without any weapons they could use they were very sought after. <P>Post kunark, new weapons, new armor, for all classes.  New skill caps for all that bring most of the classes up equal to us as monks.  <P>FD is semi nerfed to make splitting harder and like someone said earlier it seems that each new zone makes FD more worthless.  <P>Fact of the matter is, we have moved down on the EQ food chain and speaking from experience, getting into a group of people you don't know post 50 is a joke if you are a monk.  There are to many other ways to single pull or at least controlled pull a room.  <P>I would hope that verant comes to their senses before they close this book but being a monk I have have learned not to hold my breath for such things.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am not nearly as worried about monk damage as I am in the ability of a monk to control agro.  If I do the amount of damage that I was built to do then I get agroed.  Doesn't matter what I do I know that I will get agroed on at some point.  <P>Though I do tank somewhat well I do not tank the best.  The best is very important.  Even with my normal fighting ac of 1000 at lvl 53 I still get pounded on compared to warrior.  If you can't control who is getting beaten on then encouners can become increasingly difficult.  Monks have this problem.<P>For example:<BR>If I get hurt too fast and a healer has to heal me too early it is likely that the healer will get agroed.  Now the healer is getting beat up perhaps even killed.  Now my group is without a healer and the mob goes back on to me, without the healer I get killed.  Now the warrior can resume tanking.  Even with just a back-up healer he finishes it off.  Now the group has an injured warrior, no monk and only a back up healer.  <P>By getting agroed there I got two people killed.  This has set my group back quite a bit.  I can do two things to insure that I don't get this agro.  I can 1)lessen my damage output or 2) attempt to feign and have a mem wipe occur while simultaneously lessening my damage output.<P>1)  Why should I lessen my damage output?  I might as well be a warrior then.  This negates much of the reason for being a monk.<P>2) FD is horrid for getting rid of in battle agro.  Last night I went down to the hole.  We had a few pulls of rock golems.  During the fights I would end up getting agroed on.  I would turn off attack back up and FD.  This rock golem would just keep on attacking me even when I had 80% health left. (I think the supposed frenzy rumors are a bunch of BS)  Now if I pull these guys I can feign them off of me easily.  But no such luck during battle.  Is it due to massive lag?  Perhaps.  But if so then something needs to be changed so that it works even through massive lag.  This shouldn't be too difficult and needs to be done at the very least.<P>So right now I have no valid way to get rid of agro.  This hurts me and my group.  Luckily I am only lvl 53 and can actually tank fairly well at this level. But it is getting progressively worse the higher I level.<P>What needs to be done:<P>FD needs to have an anti-agro component similar to evade for rogues.  ie if you have a successful feign it moves you down the agro list.  This should work wether or not the mob keeps attacking the monk or not. <P>Until this is done monk damage can not safely be increased to where it should be.<P>Our 2HB weapons are right about where they need to be compared to the other 2HB weapons in the game.  It seems that our 1handed weapons are lacking compared to others.  Jade Mace is a very nice weapon for a monk and can be used by many classes.  Our 9/16 epic fists are nice but are matched by 9/161hs weaposn that dropped in VP and 13/20dam weapons in Necropolis.  Yes these weapons are dropped in difficult zones.  Fine.  But there need to be some superior monk weapons that also drop in VP and other difficult zones.  There should be 10/16 or 11/16 or 10/15 etc weapons that are monk specific that drop in these zones.<P>As far as one handed weapons go the best monks can do is 9/16 and 17/28.  These are fairly easy to get.  <P>Rogues can get 9/16 weapons in VP.  they can get 13/20 in Necroplolis.  These are difficult to get but still obtainable.<P>Warriors can get 13/20 dam weapons in Necropolis also.  <P>Monks need some very nice items that are hard to get but that destroy other class weapons in terms of performance.  None, to my knowledge, exist.<P>I don't care if I can never get the 11/15 wooden spoon of UBER spanking, but, DAMN IT, I want to be able to know that it is at least POSSIBLE!  I want to be able to see at least a few of my fellow monks be able to be what they should be.<P>Of course none of that matters as long as we have no way to get rid of agro.  This is very important in the high level game.  If you get agro for even a small time you are liable to be dead before you can even do anything about it.  That is unacceptable to me.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
