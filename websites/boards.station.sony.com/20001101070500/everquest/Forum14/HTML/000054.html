</FONT><HR>I also posted this in the General Discussion Board<P>Well, Kunark is out for quite a while now but something that I haven't noticed untill now makes me very angry. Now that my Guild is close to kill Trakanon in Old Sebilis I'm looking forward to get a Elder Spiritist's Breastplate soon. Like many other people I compared the Stats of the Elder Spiritist's BP and Greaves with the plainarmor. Well, the stats are better, but not that much. After I compared it with a lot of other stuff dropped for Wis-Casters in Kunark I have to say most of the Plainstuff sucks. In addition to this Druids can't wear most of those new items and the few they can wear are worse than the things for Shamans and Clerics. <BR>I also compared the improvement from Vermiculated Armor to Elder Spiritist's Armor with the improvement from other Plain sets to their corresponding Kunark sets:<P>The result is an AC improvement for about 15% (chestpiece) to 20% (legs) for Druid armor but about 30 to 33% AC improvement for all the other classes. In addition the Elder Spiritist's BP and Greaves have the worst Stats of the Wis-Caster Armor (stats without spell effects): <P>Elder Spiritists Breastplate (Druid): AC 17, +9 wis, +6 agil, +80 mana<P>Donals Chestplate of Mourning (Cleric): AC 40, +12 dex, +12 wis, +12 agil, +80 mana. <P>Jaundiced Bone Breastplate (Shaman): AC 35, +10 wis, +10 agil, +20 hp, +80 mana. <BR>..................................................<P>Elder Spiritist's Greaves: AC 10, +6 str, +6 wis, +55 Mana<P>Donal's Legging's of Mourning: AC 26, +30 MANA, +30 HP, +8 STR, +8 STA, +8 WIS, <P>Jaundiced Bone Greaves: AC 24, +8 str, +8 dex, +8 wis, +75 mana. <P>A smaller improvement of Druid-Stuff is in my oppinion an unnoticed weakening of Druids.<P>An angry <P>Haro Doomwolf, Preserver on SolRo<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Aye, tis true our fate in the world.   Simple<BR>fact being there are too many druids in Norrath.  Since the game relies on grouping they must attract players to other classes.  <P>So in short, no druid quests, no druid quest armor and severe limitations on druid equipment, ie. our planar armor and kunark armor.<P><BR>Though I wish greatly to quest for my own equipment instead of paying thousands of pp for a single piece of 30+ equipment, I have had fun helping my friends on all their quest armors and items. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hail a paradox. <P>Its all about trade-offs. Many of the things you DO get are the reason why there are armor limitations for druids. I know of one druid that has 920 ac 201 wisdom and 160 mr ALL AT THE SAME TIME (Self buffed no cleric help).  There are limitations but they arent crippling. <P>Quest Armor is easy--it was meant as a replacement for rubicite druids cant wear rubicite so they dont get quest armor. They should perhaps get  2 or 3 pieces of decent quest armor from the Temple simply because some of the other classes do. <P>Planar armor--the weight is screwey its a given. Its still chain though it isnt meant to make you able to tank effectively. It may not have as high a AC but you are not a plate wearing class never have been, never will be. <P>Kunark casting armor--for every piece with a good castable spell there are 3 useless ones. As far as the stats I cant really comment on Donals vs Elder Spiritist havent sat down and taken a hard look at the numbers. <P>I dont know but Druids have quite a lot going for them I dont see them having an honest to god NEED to have an AC over 1000 on a regular basis. <P>Just my 2c,  Belkram </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I swear to all the gods of Norrath that if Verant nerfs druids any more, I will not only quit the game for good, but I will use my professional leverage to nerf Verant. Stop nerfing! It's bad enough that you nerf classes to compensate for your own design shortcomings and oversight. Maybe if you had spent more time really finessing your work instead of patching and repatching like every other damn game developer out there, then the game would've been truly great, an example of fine craftsmanship. I hate to flame, but enough is enough. And we're tired of Verant employees posting here, saying "70% of our customers are loyal blah blah blah." Guess what? Since it's the "best" online RPG compared to AC or UO, it's more popular, but don't you think you're the "best." Despite all the problems with your gameplay and class-balancing issues, people keep playing because there's not that much choice out there. I'm sick of Verant making druids pay for their popularity. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Druids arent meant to be tanks and arent meant to be "the" healer of the group, they are meant to be support classes, able to deal dots, snare, HELP heal, etc...Stop comparing your class' armor to tank/cleric armor because you arent supposed to play those roles. If you DO wind up playing the main healer, then expect the damage on you, it cant be avoided(well actually it can be avoided, just know when to heal and when not to heal...also remember, the more times you heal in a fight, the higher you go on the aggro list). All in all, druids can be very effective in a group, but in my opinion, were never meant to be in one of the "limelight" roles, hence you dont need the heavier armor.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>What Am I doing Wrong?  <P>Everyone I talk to says that Druids Can't Tank.  I have been very successful as a tank for a group when no Warior or Hybrids were available, Just meant a little longer downtime, and closer cooperation with the casters.<P>Everyone I talk to says Druids Can't be effective Healers.  I've never had a party member die because I couldn't heal him as Group healer in the last 9 months I've played a Druid.  Just takes me a little more mana than a Cleric, and Knowledge of the Strengths and Weaknesses of my Party members.<P>Everyone I talk to says Druids Can't burn like Casters.  I guess I can stop blasting with my Burst of Flame series, and Whirling wind series spells. I guess that timing my casts, as well as giving the tanks a slight head start on damage was all a waste of time.  I guess I was wrong on my assumption that Druids were just slightly less effective Burn Mages, but still useful.<P>Here I was all this time, Controling Pulls with Harmony and Rooting, Buffing Party Members with Damage Shields, Stacking Dots with Necros, and All this other stuff that I thought was helpful, to be told that I was wasting my time.<P>Tracking, SOW, Group Teleports, I always thought that these made helping groups find and finish quests so much easier.  I guess I was wrong.<P>Gee I guess I've been playing my Druid Wrong all this time.  I never realized how much of a weak pathetic class I play.  All this time I thought I was the king of versatility, and instead I find out that my class is useless, and none of the friends I've met online wanted to group with me.<P>Wow, Thanks for the Info.

</FONT><HR>/rude @lenia <BR> Your behavior on Emarr extends to the boards it seems. You werent paying attention to what haro said. Other classes got a 33% increase in AC while druids got stuck with only a 15-20% increase not a difinitive number increase. He was wondering why there was a difference, not that he wanted to tank etc. <P>/cheer @MJL <BR> I've done many things that people say druids cant and shouldnt do as a druid that mjl has. Im the type of druid that kited his first regular cyclops in mid 20s, HG at 32, SG at 34, and IG at 36 and began to melee them while casting when they became mid-low blue, and the one that camped stuff that most people wouldn't attempt to camp without a group or 10 lvls higher solo(as long as it was in open lands other wise the situation is reversed).  Its allowed me to keep my defense and offenses maxed, and has allowed me to be one of the richest in game players i know besides the people that were already lvl 50 when i started.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"> Given druids cant melee high lvl blues for long. Given druids are so versitile and dont specifically rely on any class to stustain themselves in gaining exp(for thoose who know how to play thier class). Druids are left out on alot of things in wich I've accepted and tried to understand.  But haro does have a point ac precentage boost should be similar to the other classes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Umm.. people, actually the answer is quite easy, the classes with the highest ac get the highest percentage increase. You are NOT a plate wearing class like clerics and NOT even chain wearing like shamans so you get the least increase of those, pure casters will get less than you.
