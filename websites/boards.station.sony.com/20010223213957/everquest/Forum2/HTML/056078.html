</FONT><HR>Game balance is the problem, and that is what should be fixed, not the classes.<P>When my 5 friends and I (52-55 Druid, Ranger, Necro, Pally, SK, Druid) can go adventure, have some fun, have a shot at gaining a cool item or two in a dungeon appropriate to our level, Verant will have achieved balance IMHO.<P>I do not want or need my class balanced, because no matter what little bones get tossed our way in the way of "enhancements", my friends and I still have no decent places to adventure. Sure we could hunt the zone in Karnors and Seb, but no matter what we can not go much deeper, and the thought of a Velious dungeon is pretty much out, unless we scrape up another 12 friends to come with us.<P>So how about you just try to balance the game instead of trying to balance the classes Verant?<P>Not everyone wants to participate in a huge raid, and many of us have close groups of friends (4-5 people, not 30) we have made online that we would like to be able to hunt together with on a daily basis. The current implementation of EQ tears friends apart instead of bringing them together, do you not see a problem with that?<P>Think it over a bit...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Good point.  <P>I do think they have some class balance issues.  Melee vs caster for the most part.  (I play a shaman and he is more powerful than my warrior who is seven levels higher)<P>However Velious is far to hard.  Take out some of the loot and make it fun.  I dont want a 30 dollar expansion for the occasional raid into the continent, I wanna adventure in it.<P>Make it so no one class is a requirement or takes two or three poeple to replace it or requires the perfect combination of other classes to make it suceed.  Make it so most combinations will work in non plane and non boss encounters.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am the Ranger in Yzara's friend circle.  Our EQ life basically contains two things: Grind for experience, individually or grouped, or wait for the next big thing, which we schedule at least two weeks ahead of time and have to round up at least two other groups to do it with us.  The big raids are fun, but it doesn't happen every other day, not even once a week.  In fact, we canceled quite a few raids (one to Plane of Sky, one to Chardok, one to Seblis - that was before it got crowded) because not enough people showed up or we didn't have an Enchanter or something like that.  <P>This is really no fun.  Sure, we can always find a spot to just hunt for experience, but what is the whole point of the game?  Is there an end game when we are 60?  None.  Our druid friend has just made 60 (don't ask me how)and she still doesn't have much to do, not by herself or grouping with us.  <P>Reason is simple and everyone can tell you:  Our friend circle does not have the right combination of class.  So, we have 5 or 6 people but we are way too weak in most zones (especially those worth going) because we are not playing the right classes? After 100+ days of play time, you tell me that I play the wrong class?  That is crap.<BR>Yeah you can tell me to make friends with the "right" classes after we realize we need them.  Yes we did.  That is why we could even do raids.  But like I said, that happens at most twice a month.  Is that how you want us to play the game?  Have fun twice a month?<P>I think not.<P>Design something that can provide fun for your typical "unbalanced" group of friends of 6.  <P>Now that will keep me playing.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Forcing players to work together was a good idea.<BR>Forcing them to stay within certain margins when it comes to group/class make up was wrong in my opinion.<P>The game should have been designed in such a way that any combination of 6 players can go do anything. The only thing the players had to do was think of different strategies based on what they group could do.<P>To put it in an extremely simplified analogy, EQ should've played more like "Guantlet". There it didn't matter if all four of you picked the Warrior, you guys could still do the maze.<P>People would spend less time LFG and more time doing stuff.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Yup, I've been saying this for sometime (game isn't fun for a single varied group at high levels).  I think this was starting in kunark and was expanded on in velious.  Why?  Well since levels cap at 60 I think they figured they had to put in lots of 'raid' type zones/mobs so when you have 1500 level 60's on at one time 300 of them actually have something to do that may be a challenge.  For others like me who don't have time for 4 hour raids let alone 12 or 24hr ones it means killing a few wandering mobs in outdoor zones or right at the entrance of a zone and no more.  <P>The game is/was much more fun around level 40 or so.  A 3 to 6 person team could fight decent monsters inside or outside and have some fun for a few hours.  I used to be able to group with two rangers (me a cleric) and kill things for experience and a bit of loot.  Now me and two rangers can only take the bluest of blues in outdoor zones or we get to have one successful fight after which I'm OOM and the rangers can't kill anything till I'm full again.  <P>At 45 I could stun lots of things while the rangers whacked it (brownies for instance).  I could group with most anyone and we could have fun.  But now, at 53 I have trouble finding anything that is stunnable and those that I can stun aggro on me so hard that my few HPs don't keep me alive.  (Its silly for a stupid frog to do so much damage anyway but that's another thing).  The only way to 'win' these days is have a high defense meat shield on the mob, and enchanter/bard mezzing/charming extra(s) and a cleric keeping the meat shield alive plus assorted other groupmembers.  Its very boring.  If you have the 'right' group you can do some AOE killing but why should you need to have exactly the right people to do either of these strategies?  A nice rounded group should still be fun in most of the zones that can give them exp but they are not.  <P>I didn't mind it when druids and shamans could heal almost as good as I could and had other skills.  I was always the healer, could do other things ok (stun/nuke) if needed and had lots of friends to group with.  But now all my old friends are either gone or are always in day-long raids that I can't attend, my stuns are useless and my nukes bounce off of anything close to my level.  The only things I can solo for exp use all my mana (sometimes more than all) and can take 15 minutes with all the rooting and medding plus another 15 minutes of sitting waiting for my mana to come back  (wow a low blue mob every half hour!).  Other folks hunting outside tend to be solo types who don't need a cleric so I have trouble even finding a 2 hour group (I can only play that long)<P>Getting pickup groups for a few hours fun used to be easy, now its difficult.  A single group should be able to do stuff and see things but they can't so folks either play a solo char or are in long raids all night.  No fun unless you play this game for a living.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It is actually somewhat sad, but to me at least, it appears that in order to distract the general playerbase from the real issues at hand, Verant has turned all the classes against each other.<P>So instead of everyone turning to Verant and demanding that the game be fixed, everyone is yelling "Nerf him / enhance me!!" and then settle for the little bones that get thrown to them.<P>All the while Verant is smiling in the background because they now do not have to spend the time and resources to fix the big problem. Nerfing / Enhancing a class is trivial to the task of actually fixing the game.<P>So do you think that all these "Class Discussion" threads of Absors are here to help your class finally get "Balanced"? If you really think that, you are sadly mistaken, they serve only two purposes:<P>1. To make Verant appear as if they actually listen (although they told you what to say and you fell for it) care, and are trying to help you.<P>2. Distract you from the real problem and buy them an infite amount of time.<P>If all goes well with the plan, EQ will have run its course and Verant will never actuially have to fix it. They can just ignore it and try not to make the same mistake in the next game. But then again, so what if they do, they found the perfect way of leading everyone around by the nose and masking the problem anyways *shrug*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Balance doesn't seem to be what they are after, unless you call 'balance' having an even ability to find a group in an uber-mob raid (which includes 80% of post 50 velious).  I think that's all they are doing.  The problem is a game should be fun, not just 'even' and not just 'challenging'.  But no one seems to be in charge of 'fun'.  Clerics are being used as the guide to which shaman/druids are compared for grouping. This means they will not touch clerics no matter how boring they are to play. They will only look at this one view of 'can you group'.  If you say 'my class isn't balanced because its very boring and we never get any new things to do' it is ignored because they don't care if you are having fun, just are you equally groupable.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have to agree with the idea of this post. Game balance is the key, however I think class balance is part of that key. I believe that once the classes are balanced (and that may never actually happen) then you know how to design the mobs based on what the classes can do. Now that you have the mobs balanced with the classes you need to make sure the zone they are in is balanced, and then you can do the item balance.<P>From my point of view you can't do the other balances without having a base to go off of (class balance) Hence I believe that you need to balances the classes, then balance everything else.<P>If you go and balance the classes and stop there you've only balanced 1/4th of the problem and you will have to go back and do it again down the line.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Today I play about 1/5th as often with my friends as I used to one year ago, because the groups we would make just aren't strong enough anymore and we can't putter around with two or three people safely in any of the 50+ dungeons while we wait for our friends to log in and fill the group. The result is night after night of pickup groups, and I have to tell ya, pickup groups are fine now and then, but I don't log in to play with strangers. I want to play with friends.<P>It's the mobflation that's killing options and tearing apart friends and forcing people to turn into tacticians every single day they play.

Things weren't perfect in the pre-Kunark days but I *will* say this. Classes were MUCH more balanced in the old days with respect to what they could contribute to the overall group risk/reward. It wasn't truly balanced, but it was much better then, than it is today. Now that kind of balance is shattered, and honestly, we're never going to see it again.<P>It's tragic.

</FONT><HR>This is an excellent thread.  Many points made are right on the money.<P>Pre ROK almost any type of group configuration could work.  This enabled people to basically play whatever class they would enjoy and be able to group and hunt almost anywhere.<P>This changed dramatically when Kunark came out and new levels were added.  Verant really did poor planning here.  Rather than keep all the clases "close" in skill levels like it was pre ROK, they started to "widen" the differences, hence some classes simply became more "powerful" than others. Also they went for the "dungeon crawl" concept instead of the "camping an area in the dungeon" concept.  As a result many people found they couldn't do this since a) they just didn't have that kind of time commitment and b) it took basically a certain group make-up to do the "crawl" successfully.<P>As it stands now basically a set few classes wind up dominating the high end game, namely the cleric/warrior/rogue/enchanter.  There really isn't much room for substitutions anymore.<P>The class threads really do become silly after awhile.  Most posts simply become "wishlisting".  The only real solution would be to put all the classes back on close parity as it was pre ROK, something Verant won't or is unable to do.<P>SOV really is a flop for me. I've gone there maybe twice since it started.  It is impossible to explore without having an "army" of "specialists".<P>I start to get the impression that when designing changes Verant keeps an eye towards what might make the Uber guilds happy, yet by doing so they wind up hurting THE BULK of their player base.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Ok, so I have pointed out "The Problem", so lets talk about some solutions.<P>Verants main fears:<P>1) If they do not make mobs Uber-Hard, high level people will just farm them.<P>Well, to stop farming, they just need to implement anti-farming measures. Do something like if the mob is green to the person who kills it, its chance of dropping its loot gets reduced 90%. Another solution would be to randomize the spawn points of mobs. If any rare could pop in the place of any spawn, well that would certainly cut down on someones ability to camp.<P>2) If the Uber players get bored and leave they will bad mouth the game and say its lame.<P>Verant has already addressed this problem with zones like Dragon Necropolis, Veeshans Peak and other places. There is no reason that entire continents need to be tuned for these folks, they will go play in the places that challenge them and drop the best loot for them. Sure most of us will never see these zones or the loot (which should all be no drop btw), but the zones we do hunt in will not require equipment of the likes that they have to succeed.<P>3) If the players in general are not challenged, they will get bored and leave.<P>Well, there is a difference between being challenged and having to enter a death trap. Death should be the penalty for doing something dumb, not the norm. With the huge agro in some zones, this is just crazy, there is nothing challenging about this, it about being lucky and memorizing the exact places you can and can not move and having and enchanter with you.<P>A perfect example is the right courtyard in Karnors, stand in the corner there and the whole frigging jail from the basement runs up to greet you. What is the sense in that? How would any mob that is in the dungeon below you even know that you are up there in the courtyard, do they have closed circut surveillience cams or something?<P>Make moving around in these places tricky, difficult even, but not stupid impossible with unreasonable things happening.<P>Other things that can enhance gameplay:<P>1) Do not make getting class gear impossible for the normal Joe.<P>As someone else mentioned in another post, Kunark BP's and Legs seem to be reserved for the uber (equiped) guilds with awesome tactics and limitless numbers of people. This class armour should be available to everyone, let the uber guilds have something better that ONLY drops in the uber places. Feel free to limit the number of drops, put level restrictions on wearing it, whatever, but at least let it be obtainable. After two years of playing this game I think I at least deserve a shot at it.<P>2) Quests (other than the Epic quests) should not require more than a group to obtain a item needed in the quest.<P>Velious armour quests require a minimum of 3 VERY well balanced groups to obtain. This is quest armour, not dropped armour. The very fact that it is a quest item should imply that you need to use your head, not just muscle to complete it.<P>3) Quests should never force you to spend endless hours slaughtering "greenies" and ticking off all the appropriate level people in the zone.<P>Quests should give experience. If the reward is a level 30 item, you should have to deal with level 30 areas to complete it, not level 12 areas. Is there some reason that if you are doing a quest you are not entitled to exp hunt at the same time?<P>4) Quests should appear and disappear and constantly be rotating.<P>A quest mob should not always give out a quest. However, new quests should be developed all the time and implemented, not huge quests, just little fun ones that have some minor (but worthwhile) reward. Maybe something like a stone of greater healing with one charge. By not always being available, or even given by the same mob or even in the same zone, you could control the "farming" of such a item.<P>5) Weapons of equal stats shuld be available in numerous different places.<P>Right now everyone wants a Jade Mace or Lamentation. How come there isn't 5-10 different blades/maces, all with different looks, that have the same stats? If nothing else, this would at least add some serious flavor to the game. There are some cool looking Kunark weapons (Kunzar Ku'juch) that I would love to carry if it had the stats.<P><BR>Well I guess thats enough for now. I hope Verant reads this and finds some of this helpful.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I certainly agree with the title of this post. Even if classes are imbalanced, a skill set of a class is only about 50%-60% of what constitutes a character, the other 40%-50% of a classes abilities is determined by the equipment and weapons they are using.<P>It is pointless to even try to balance a class if the equipment a character is carrying is not appropriate for their level. A teens character using mid-40s or 50s level armour and weapons will have much more of a impact on how the game runs or plays out then any minor tweaking of said characters skill set or abilities.<P>Yes I'm talking about twinking, which for all intent and purposes really means cheating no matter how hard you try to counter-argue the point. Giving or allowing low level characters to obtain high level equipment makes what would otherwise be appropriately difficult encounters be a lot easier then they should be.<P>By no right should a low or mid level character be allowed to make use of items only obtainable by characters that are very high in level. Someone could argue that a weapon drop off a 45+ mob is of not a sufficient standard for a Lvl 45+ character, if that is the case then make the item/weapon drop off a appropriately leveled mob for the level of characters it is truly meant for.<P>From the first day Everquest was introduced, every single item in the game should have had a minimum skill level attributed to it. If for instance you have a 1HB weapon that drops off a Lvl 35+ monster, the weapon would require someone to have a minimum 1HB Weapon skill of 180 before they can even swing it, by simply just having a weapon not proc until a certain level just doesn't go far enough.<P>The more and more I do research on equipment and weapons for my character, the more I have come to realise that Everquest certainly is top heavy in regards to items a average player can look forward to. Nothing even remotely interesting is available from Lvl40- but from Lvl40+ everything starts opening up to a player. Throughout a characters history, they should be able to naturally progress from one good item to the next better one but all only obtainable from their own efforts. Sure you can buy that Lvl50+ mob dropped Sword or armour at Lvl13 but it is useless to you until you reach lvl 50.<P>As it stands, obtainablility of equipment is not evenly distributed through the entire ranges of levels, this grossly out balances the game and only rewards a player once they've spent a couple of months leveling hard to finally reach the level where they can earn good items for themselves.<P>I've already mentioned this exact same argument in another post, a player should feel rewarded for their efforts all throughout their adventuring career, not just at the last 20 to 15 levels they obtain.<P>If twinking was not possible, balancing of the whole of EQ would be a simple matter as everyone would be appropriately equiped for their level and you would not have the cases of players having characters more powerful then what they should be. Verant could easily determine what sort of weapons and equipment a certain level character would probably have and then the monsters would be balanced in difficulty accordingly. The problem at the moment is this is just not possible, the array of equipment available to any level character, regardless whether they should have it or not, is enourmous which is probably why all the creatures in Velious are balanced more towards the the uber equiped characters then your average joe.<P>So the only way balance Everquest and keep it balanced is to introduced minimum skill levels for every item in the game and makes sure they are can be obtain by the approriately leveled character that should be using them, not 20 levels higher then the person who truely should be using the item.<P>Kullnan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Great thread!  I've been pondering the class balance issue myself, and no matter what Verant does there is still going to be the same basic problem.  Post 50 you pretty much have to group with an enchanter, cleric, warrior.  When you spend 8 hours to get one blue bubble of exp, who wants to die without a rez and then spend the next hour begging for one?  Worse still who wants to go deep into the Hole knowing that if a group mate dies, there is no way to bring him back without a cleric present. I know many enchanters who refuse to group without a cleric present because they feel shamans/druids just don't cut it.<P>My husband and I used to play with a friend regularly, we had a shaman, wizard and necro.  We used to have a blast until we reached 52.  At that point we couldn't dungeon crawl effectively without the "required" classes.  So we went and created a bard, enchanter and cleric and started grouping that way.  In one sense it solved our problem, but in another it's distressing.  My shaman is still my favorite class, but she's been basically parked unless a large guild raid comes up.<P>Another problem is SoV, I was really looking forward to having more zones in the 50-60 area.  Unfortunately these zones are more difficult then Kunark 50-60 zones.  You need to have at least 2 groups to do Siren's Grotto, and with the faction issues, it severly limits where you can hunt.  We're not exactly limited in 30-50 zones, so I'm not sure what Verant was thinking when they made SoV.  I find myself getting bored with the game, I still love the basic premise, but there isn't much to look forward to now.<P>One person posted about having rotating quests, or introducing new quests.  I completely agree, it would be intriguing to have a certain quest that only exists for a couple months, and then have something new.  It would bring the focus back to questing, right now the quests are either too difficult or too boring (camping greens).<P>Ah well that's all I can think of right now.<P>Maddy  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree with most of what has been said too.<P>I actually don't intend on taking any characters over 50 simply because I know that after that level the game becomes one of insanely long raid times and intricate tactical thinking to get the right group etc.   That simply doesn't sound like fun to me.  <P>I thought I was alone in this view until I started questionning friends who play EQ and, it seems, more and more say "i'm going to abandon my character at 50 and start something else".  When I hear half the people I know on EQ say that, I begin to wonder what has gone astray in the high end game.<P>I know what I enjoy.  I enjoy grouping without having to worry about what classes i'm grouping with.  I enjoy trade skills, but without having to mindlessly kill MOBs in order to raise my level in order to advance my trade skill.  I'd enjoy puzzle/riddle quests which can be done at any level because they test the player's brain and not simply rely on the player killing X-number of Y-level MOBs for a certain 'piece'.  That isn't a quest, that's a shopping list.<P>Those are things i'd *like* to see.  Don't get me wrong, I do have great fun playing EQ, but that is because i've used my head and tailored my playing around what *is* possible.  I've also dumped the idea of reaching the mythical 'end-game'.  It isn't going to happen for me, so I have to invent my own goals.<P>It would be great if Verant could inject a bit more variety and fun into it.  We're not all interested in 'phat lewt', as people keep saying..some of us want to log on for a few hours with our friends and do something that is fun and challenging.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I like this thread. It seems very accurate and well reasoned. Somewhere above someone mentioned that twinking was hurting the game, and I agree. My highest level character is 29 now, since I can't twink I feel a sense of accomplishment and pride in the items I have quested for. But this has come at a price. I have had to scour spoiler sites for information on these quests and on some of my class skills and abilities, simply because there is no information in the game about these things. I once was contemplating creating a mud of my own, and I realized that people would give items to other people that could unbalance play at lower levels. My solution was that the items of power would cause the user to be awarded experience as though they were of higher level. Because of the fine gradation of levels I was planning this would prevent a newly created character who possessed a sword of nuclear destruction from gaining experience from creatures that they would normally fight. This would force them to fight creatures much more powerful, which would kill the character easily. This could be adapted to EQ in the following manner. If a weapon is meant for a thirth fifth level character then someone using that weapon would not gain experience from a mob of less than thirty levels, plus the corpse would poof instantly. This would clear out alot of twenty something warriors using twin yaks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>/agree<P>I agree with most everything that has been said here.  I have a 46 Warrior on Lanys.  I should be having the time of my life being one of the "uber" classes.  Trouble is, I didn't start my warrior to be uber, I started him because, to me, he was the most fun of all the chars I had made to that point.  <P>Now I have trouble getting mostivated to get a cleric, a chanter, and some nukers, maybe even another warrior together just to go try to get a bit of experience.  Pick up groups become exponentially harder to get into at higher levels.  This added to the fact that one or two greenies in Velious, low greens at that, could take my warrior apart fairly quickly with no support.  Too big of a deathtrap for me.<P>Anyone want to think about the damage an ogre takes bouncing his way through DL to fight at the castle, all in the hope of getting exp?<P>It used to be 6 players could hold almost any spawn in their level range, group make up didn't have the serious impact it does now.  Warrior, SK, Pally - it didn't matter.  Druid, Shaman, heck even sometimes a bard for heals - it didn't matter.  Short one tank, grab a mage or necro.  Now if you aren't a warrior or cleric, you are a liability.  <P>4 warriors and 2 clerics would go a heck of a long way getting items and exp in the end game.  This is not balance, this is mobs being too resistant with too many HP.  Balance the game to the players Verant, because we know you will never balance the players to the game, much less to each other.<P>Did anyone else find it disturbing that Verant pretty much knew what changes they were going to make to the classes, they just wanted some posts to support their changes?  I mean come on, after 1000 posts for each class, the change they want to make is bound to be there.  I've only read the melee threads, I can assure you the warrior thread was not even read.  Nothing constructive and viable (like increased taunt) will make it into the game.  Just the double whammy Verant had planned all along.  Not a hybrid/warrior rant, just an observation that comes perilously close.<P>Ooryl<BR>lanys<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree with this thread as well.  <P>I am very disappointed in the "end game".  I feel like I have nothing to look forward too when I reach 50. I don't really want my epic weapon.  I don't really want my planar armor.  I would like more places to play with a mixed group of friends, places to have adventures that don't take 8-10 hours of continuous play time. I want what I had back at level 20--lots of places to go and get a pick-up group, with adventures that gave me some experience.  How many people level 51 and up can say, hey, where shall we go this evening for about 3 hours, with friends who might be a ranger, or a bard, or a wizard?  I want to have fun playing my class, maybe even using more than one or two of the spells they have given me. I don't need my class changed, just more options to use the spells filling up my spell book (most of which are never memmed).<P>There has been so much written about EQ addiction lately, and I think this is one of the core problems.  You cannot play for two hours when you are level 45+ and do anything except perhaps some quick experience camping, if you can find a group quickly (which usually means you get really lucky), and that is probably from 45-49 basically.  So people who enjoy playing have to commit for hours of time, and end up neglecting families and real life activities because of the basic game design.  A perfect example:  a dragon raid.  You go on the raid, everyone dies for some reason, and then you have a five hour period of time while all the bodies get recovered and rezzed.  So it's 2am instead of 10pm when you log off.<P>I wish I had an answer on how to make the game more accessible to the casual player. Class balance does not seem to be the answer.  <P>EverQuest really is such a fun game to play.  I have devoted many hours of my life to it.  But until we can get over the hump of the only goal seeming to be a group of perfectly balanced people joining up with three (or more)other groups of the same perfect balance to do a difficult and time consuming loot camp, I think the game will slowly lose interest to all but the most devoted players who have the time and inclination to succeed in this virtual environment.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I would like to play devil's (Verant's) advocate here.<P>We want game balance. I agree.<P>But what can be done now?<P>First, balance classes would help. Hard to create new zones for the next expansion that all 14 classes can play in when people are only grouping with 4 or 5 classes (at the highest level).<P>So, ok, let's assume for a minute that within the next month or two enough class balancing will occur to make all classes playable and groupable to 60th level.<P>What then?<P>Maybe reduce the amount of experience required to level above 50 to help motivate us to keep leveling? Yes, it is ridiculous as it stands, but changes are also problematic. Suddenly all 57th level characters become 60th? Or, take away exp they have already earned to keep them 57th? This would be a tough change to implement, and no matter what change Verant makes, a significant portion of the player base will resent it.<P>Is the game still out of whack? If a druid, necro, wiz, mage, sk, ranger can go hunting anywhere a cleric, chanter, shaman, war, monk, rogue could, is it balanced?<P>Maybe, for the most part, it would be.<P>Still, plenty of zones that single groups can't hunt in. So many SoV zones are unplayable to the average casual player.<P>Is there a fix for zones that require multiple groups?<P>No, I don't think so. If one group can hunt for a great game experience, then two groups can massacre everything and farm the loot. Even making everything no-drop, the larger guilds will still need to get equipment on their main characters, or will still bring level 20 twinks along who will loot the no-drops themselves.<P>So there has to be zones that challenge the two or three (or more) group teams, and those zones must have loot that motivates people to find 20-30 friends to raid the zone. Believe it or not, some people do like to play this way.<P>But, these zones should be reasonable in number, and no single group should have to pass through these zones to play in single-group zones (read: Siren's Grotto).<P>What about time sinks? Camps like the Aegis of Life, or Testament of Vanear, Jboots, or Raster? Tons of other examples. All we do is camp greenies for no exp, no challenge, no fun, for hours on end. Can this be fixed?<P>Sure, by removing the quests entirely or by replacing with other quests. The first option is worse than having the quests - it leaves those of us willing to sink the time without an option. The second choice is better, but it would take tons of work, thousands of hours developing and programming and testing these changes.<P>Best gear being only available to people with 12 hours for raids, or with 30 friends all in the level range of 55-60?<P>Yep, this seems unfair to the 98% of us that don't have that advantage. We'll never get the good gear.<P>Is there a solution? <P>Probably not. Those players want to get better gear. Taking the uber gear out of the game is not fair to the players who have struggled hard and played hard to get there. Making it more available just makes it more available to twinks too. Any solution to stop twinking will also destroy the player economy, making it less likely for us casual gamers to get that gear than it already is.<P>Level limits on most items, and making most of them lore and many of them no-drop, would really reduce the uber-camping and the twinking. But at the cost of player economy again. Maybe that cost is worth it. I for one like the idea that when I find something better, I might make some plat selling the gear I am replacing. Or that I might give some of my gear to my 14th level paladin, just because I earned it, and I want to get more use out of it.<P>I could go on much longer than I already have.<P>My point is that there are tons of changes that could improve EQ.<P>Think Verant can make these changes now? Of course not. This would require massive rewrites of huge chunks of code. Rewrites of this nature are never called patches, or upgrades. They are called new versions. Going from 1.05 to 2.0. In other words, let's hope Verant plans this kind of stuff for EQ2, because very little, if any, will be implemented in EQ.<P>I wish EQ could be better. I fully support your desire to see improvements. I think we should continue posting these types of requests.<P>But, realistically, all that will change now is a few bones thrown our way to hold us over until we can start playing EQ2. Nothing else would be cost effective, especially since EQ2 is already in development. Hopefully threads like this one will make EQ2 become the game we all want to play.<P>Morodullin<BR>Devil's Advocate Priest o Brell<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Orodruin,<P>I am going to key in on one thing you said because the ansers to most of the other points you made actually appear in the posts above.<P>"Yep, this seems unfair to the 98% of us that don't have that advantage. We'll never get the good gear."<P>It appears that even you seem to acknowledge that this game has been targeted more and more to the 2% minority. Your post plays devils advocate (which I like to do sometimes as well), but in saying that Verant can not/will not change something that negatively affects 98% of their customers is wrong.<P>No business in the world could succeed if they consentrated all their efforts on 2% of their customers at the expense of the other 98%. Good business dictates that they address and resolve the problems.<P>That said, the general playerbase needs to stop being distracted with all this class balance BS that Verant is tossing out there to keep us from forcing them to fix the real problems. If the game was balanced correctly, chances are the classes would be also. People of certain classes would not feel left out, underpowered, unwanted, yadda, yadda, yadda...<P>Re-tune THE GAME to make it an enjoyable and doable experience for a mixed group of random adventurers, and it does not matter what their skills are, they will make it work. Everyone always wants bigger, better, badder stuff and abilities, but that is only because Verant has created a world that our current abilities are not good enough for.<P>Tuning classes will not change the game, it will not allow 6 random class friends to have fun together once again. It may make some classes more desireable in groups (at the expense of others), but it will not enhance the FUN FACTOR one iota or mean my 5 friends and I can go do a quest in Kael.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056078-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056078-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056078-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056078-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056078-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056078-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056078&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056078&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
