</FONT><HR>Last night on Povar, the GM staff sent a server wide message and began deleting ALL guilds on the server WITHOUT REGARD TO SIZE.<P>Harmonium, one of the larger guilds on Povar was deleted as was Ykz.<P>The guild that I belong to, Quixotic Union of Optimists, was deleted as well. We have approximately 40 active members encompassing over 80 total characters and have existed in Norrath since the first month of the game's release in 1999.<P>While I understand the mistake that was made, I URGE Verant to investigate the way in which the GM responded to our Guildmaster's petition for reinstatement, the language that he used, the hostility that he displayed towards long time paying customers, and his arbitrary demands (such as we need to assemble 20 of our guild members in one zone at midnight to get reinstated).<P>The way that this mistake was handled was atrocious and the behavior of your support staff was completely unprofessional.<P>I am thus asking that our guild be reinstated right away AND that the conduct of the GMs involved be investigated to the fullest extent. Further, I am asking that Verant publicly take action against these GMs if their behavior is, in fact, deemed inappropriate.<P>Thank you<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Last thing I heard was to bring 10 guild members on-line at the same time, petition and the GM will re-guild us.<P>We have, although we lost 2 people because of this, still over the 10 person minimum.

</FONT><HR>Erollisi Marr, Stormriders was also deleted.  We petitioned and were told to re-petition on Sunday as that is when the guild creation moratorium would be lifted.  We coordinated and had 10 Stormriders online on Sunday and petitioned for reinstatement.  <P>The Lead GM, Valtron, said the list showed only 8 members when pulled.  When asked when this list was pulled he said 9/28/00 (Thursday, day of the patch).  We had 12 members (accounts) well before Thursday.  Even though we had 10 logged in and waiting reinstatement, the GM said there was nothing he could do and he could not go against "The List."<P>The latest news is "wait for a patch message for information about recreation."  This will happen anywhere between now and never, me thinks.<P>What makes this even worse was that many of our members are a close knit group of real life friends who've known each other for over 3 years.  We purposefully kept the guild small because of our close ties and did not wish to be a big guild at all, but I assure you we had 12 active accounts.<P>Xarlor<BR>Erollisi Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Abashi, I would like to know why the lists the GMs are using for guild reinstatement are incorrect?  My guildmaster waited 7 hours last night on Erollisi Marr to get our guild reinstated.  We had 10 member accounts before the purge.  Two were added the night before the purge, and I can understand how those might have been slow propogating through your databases.  I can understand it, but it's pretty mickey-mouse to set out deadlines to your customers that your system can't even handle.  But your list said we only had 7.  How is that?  The last new member added, excepting the two above, was a couple of weeks ago.  There are rumors going around that any given account can be counted toward only one guild, and the other 7 characters on that server don't count toward the totals of whatever guilds they belong to.  Could that be true?  Please clear this up, my frustration could be helped a little by some answers.  The server GM wouldn't even talk to us, he wanted to go home.  I do want to say that the guides on Erollisi Marr were great last night, though.<P>Guilden<BR>Tempestatis Lumen (We shall return!)<BR>Erollisi Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
