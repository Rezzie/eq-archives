</FONT><HR>Yep.  Tsorath is right.  I've grouped with him plenty of times in Sebilis myself, he's an awesome Shaman, knows tons about his class, and he also plays it great.<P>Any cannibalize spell (1, 2, 3) will put you higher on the hatelist, it doesn't matter if it sucks more health from you, the mobs don't like it.  I was grouped with a Shaman in Sebilis named Asperanza.  I think she's 60 now, but she was 57 at the time.  We were at bridge 2, and we had a pretty bad pull just before we reached the grup place.  Enchanter's mezzing, Asperanza is slowing, and then we started taking them out one by one.<P>We had a ShadowKnight in there helping us, named Xusilak (one of the best taunters I know), and ShadowKnights are *UBER* at tanking, because they have spells that piss the mobs off the most.<P>After we got down to the last mob, Asperanza started to cannibalize (this was while the frog was still mez'd), and Xusilak started throwing shadow vortexes (to taunt the frog, but not break mez).  I thought Xusilak would have taunted enough, so it wouldn't jump the Enchanter, but when Xusilak broke mez with disease cloud, the frog went straight for Asperanza.  Took a couple vortexes to get it off her.<P>Also, if you think superioer healing is more effecient than complete healing, do the math  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Jaldarith Raynoari<BR>54th Vicar of Hate<BR>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Tsorath,<P>And so we're back to comprehension problems and idiocy. Buy your own dictionary, look up the word "fallacious", it's there. Oh, and make sure to use my spelling rather than your miscopy.<P>You have had far more experience with cann than I will ever have? That's as cogent an argument as stating that you've lived longer than I ever will. (Yes, cogent is a real word as well)<P>Now, let's address your patent (that's a word as well) misunderstanding of what I said. Downtime is important. The less of it the better. I, a cleric, used nothing more than superior heal when camping the mushrooms in Sebilis. With me so far?<P>*Sigh* Forget it, the rest of this argument is so blatantly obvious as to not be worth the effort to type. Turning shaman into walking mana stones DOES make them more efficient than clerics.<P>Not that: More efficient, NOT more efficient healers, although they would be that as well in many circumstances.<P>"Riiiiight and that therefore makes her a better healer then you are?"<BR>Nope. Not better, more efficient. Partial misquotes will not score you points. Less downtime = more efficient.<P>See the equation? (That's a real word too, and I spelled it correctly, your thumbs must be tired by now from leafing through those pages.)<P>Jaldarith,<P>I never suggested that superior (one 'e') healing is more efficient (two 'e's, two 'i's) than complete healing.

</FONT><HR>I finally figured out the purpose of this thread.<P>It has nothing to do with healing, etc.  The people complaining are upset because they can't find a group.  Good friggin ghods!<P>I'm not saying anything specific about people, but, is there a reason you can't get a group?  I mean, c'mon now, seriously, how hard is it for you to find a group?<P>On the server I play on, at prime-time, there are only about 20 clerics on the server.  Notice I said PRIME-TIME here.  Not at some weird hour of the day.<P>Now, when I do a /who all sham or /who all dru, I usually get the "there are too many to list" message.<P>Now, what does this tell us?  That there are too damn many druids & shamans?  Possibly.  It also says that there are not a lot of people who WANT to play a cleric.  And I know, you'll give me the "Well, they might be anon, so you won't see them"  True, but normally, that is because most high lelvel clerics get bugged for: Rezzes, buffs, and heals.  You want to get annoyed, try playing a cleric with lvl 49 rez.  It is absolute hell, let me tell you.  <P>Not just that, but if you are a cleric without a group, and someone sees you there, 9 times out of 10, the person will come up and say 'Heal plz'.  Now, that's not so bad, but usually these people will expect you to be there to heal them, buff them, etc., and then badmouth you if you don't.  This doesn't happen all the time, but I have been the brunt of "You GOTTA do it, man!  You're a cleric for ghods sakes!", and then get "You suck, I'll make sure no one groups with you" if you don't do as they say.<P>As I said, this doesn't happen all the time.  But, if this is all about getting groups, you can do 2 things.  1. Create a cleric character, and powerlevel the hell out of it, or 2. play tyhe character you have, and maybe try a little bit harder to find a group.  Otherwise, maybe it's time for you to find a game that suits what you are looking for, which is obviously a character who can do everything, and needs no help from anyone.<P>Again, just my 2 cp.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I got a cleric and i find the the speed of the spell most important. Remedy is nice 'n fast at 3 seconds. Any other spell is wasted on an enchanter. . they just die a bit too fast.

</FONT><HR>Oh I get to feed the trolls!<P>Crybaby babbled: "I changed my name firstly to inflate your overly-larged ego. It worked. And secondly to show that most clerics are whiners when it comes to their MONOPOLY on healing (that didn't exist Pre 50)."<P>You changed your name as a sign of your immaturity. You can't bring logic to the discussion so you whine and moan like a cat in heat. And please show me proof of my overly-larged ego as you put it. At best you're a simpering moron trying to justify why you're fit to use oxygen. Your greatest contribution to this discussion is to tell us you're about to remove yourself from the gene pool.<P>He also drooled: "Neither do most of the druid/shaman out there of the posts that I have read so where are you spewing this crap from? Please close your leggs."<P>LSB and Rhynne both ask for these things. While LSB is an admitted idiot, Rhynne is quite a logical debator. And where do you get the "close your leggs" thing from? Why exactly are you between my legs you pathetic freak. Talk about someone who can't separate themselves from the issue. You're sick.<P>YOu continued displaying your ignorance with: "My cleric would welcome the help and how would moving Sup Heal (a spell we already get at 53) to 49 and reducing Fizzle on it be taking anything away from you??"<P>Pull up a search of my posts nimrod. Maybe you'll learn something.<P>In you close you sipped up more of the "idiots delight" with: "*want to talk about foolishness and greed? Look in the mirror*"<P>Yes, perhaps you should look in the mirror at the nitwit that talks about someone elses genitalia, spout off about what you haven't even put thought to, and has jerk-kneed posts that would be funny if you didn't take yourself so serious.<P>Tsorath, another jerk-kneed poster said: "Get off your soapbox and read the majority of posts from high level shaman and druids and you will see thats the case."<P>Why don't YOU pull up a search of my posts wiseguy. Perhaps you'll see that I HAVE SAID THE SAME THING. Give them Sup heal at a lower level, reduce the fizzle, with another heal at 55. What pisses me off are those of you that have to use clerics as "the enemy" in your posts. Much like you do.<P>You then ranted: "Wheres your original ideas about the cleric class?"<P>Do a search on may name for yesterday's date. There's an easy going thread with cleric ideas. Noone's serious about it because clerics tend to play with the tools they have at hand. Some of us play "battleclerics" some crowd controllers, some stunners, some nukers, etc. I'm pretty happy with my class. How about you?<P>"All I ever read from you guys is clerics are sooo hard,"<P>You're full of your own hot air. You haven't heard me say that. You're the one that's so hot on using the search engine, put up or shut up.

</FONT><HR>It's not even a cleric issue. Most people talk about "a rezzer". Some of the more sane groups I've been in lately plan a balanced group of 5 and reserve a slot for "a rezzer", almost regardless of level.<P>Heck I was in a frenzy group the other day that was me, a warrior and FOUR clerics. The warrior kept inviting clerics of incremental levels in. Being only level 40 I stopped getting exp when he finally invited the bored level 60 cleric in who wanted something to do between rezzes. But get this. The warrior was level 42... So he wasn't getting exp either.

</FONT><HR>Someone asked me to elaborate so I will.<P>Pre-kunark, Shamans and druids were better primary healers outside of the planes/dragons because Shamans had Togor's + Regen, and Druids had Damage Shield + Regen, and BOTH of them dished out damage fast enough that mobs would die before the superior healing from a cleric would kick in.  Clerics then, as now, were worthless for offensive output.  If you were in Solusek B or Lower Guk you would kill more mobs with a Shaman or druid than you would with a cleric (assuming these mobs could be found.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> )  If you died and got no res, oh well, an hour later you had the xp back anyway.  This was the situation pre-Kunark and it drove a LOT of clerics away from being clerics...many of them play Shamans and Druids now.  I have a Shaman originating from these days too.<P>If Verant moved Superior Heal to level 49 so it wouldn't fizzle so much, then Shamans would get a 1600 hit point heal equivalent against slowable mobs(which is the majority of mobs in the game), Plus they still get nice regen spells.  Like I said originally, when it comes to Shaman healing the biggest problem is yard trash that is un-slowable.<P>I don't speak about post-Kunark Druids as I have no knowledge.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>If you think the Clerics have a monopoly because of healing issues, you're wrong. People gravitate towards high-level "rezzes", not healers. The simple proof of this is the fact that people limit themselves to places where they will /be able/ to get a high-level rez, not neccessarily group with the person going to give it. Getting them into the group is just a bonus because it generally means any rezzes will be free.<P>The trouble is with those infamous words now, "... so we'll be OK if we need rezzes".<P>The people choosing clerics over shaman or druids or paladins, by and large, don't care about the group balance issues - you give more credit than is due in thinking that - they are simply trying to take the best advantage of the risk eliminating option, "the rez".</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Kayfess you may be right but I sure as hell dont think so. <P>When rok came out with mobs who hit much harder than old school mobs verant in their finite wisdom gave dru/shm a better heal. Now when sov comes out and mobs hit even harder then rok mobs plus many are HIGHLY MR and thus takes a long time to slow or are UNSLOWABLE they chose NOT to give dru/shm an upgraded heal. This makes little or no sense. Obviously CH should NEVER have been put in the game cuz verant now has trouble upgrading a clerics heal. Since they cant give "better" heal spells then what clerics already have any improvement to druids/shm is seen by clerics to a nerf to their class since their own healing abilities didnt go up. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Apollohades, after reading cleric related posts the last few weeks it's obvious that clerics in general are the biggest whining cry babies of them all. Why is that you feel there should be a spot in a group designated for you upon logging? Are you angry because you didn't expect to sit on your a$$ medding 90% of the time, that you deserve it because your class is so boring that you can actually watch a movie and talk on the phone at the same time while playing?<P>There is no point arguing with people like you. You are an angry little man and I rather do something else.

</FONT><HR>Verant: Why don't you throw up a poll when you start the game on this subject? That would be the only way to get an even halfway descent response from the player base. The threads on this board are just ridiculously funny, it's the same people posting over and over again with the "I dont like you" ,"Well I dont like you more" and the oh so repetitive *grammar posts*. Let the players as a whole decide, not the few clerics/druids/shammys that even bother to post on this subject anymore.<P>If theres anyway you could direct this poll to only people who have a character over 50 would be even better (and if there is no way you could maybe it would be a good time to create a way, would help with alot of issues if you directed them only to the people who are affected by them) Also a poll when you start the game would allow people to vote in private instead of a tank/chanter/other class being scared his/her normal cleric is going to read his/her post advocating what they feel is a nerf.<P>The poll idea you all have been doing upon startup is a great idea. *Assuming* you're letting the player base as a whole influence you moreso than before, which you should, something you feel works "as intended" may with that optimized group. But we each have our individual friends/situations that sometimes differ from the norm. Should we be extremely limited as to what we can do because of that fact? <P>**Please** let the players have a say in this not just the board junkies. And please dont wait 18 months to make the change  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> <P>And since the original thread is closed ill post this here thanks for the changes to hybrids you made alot of friends very happy today, I'm even going to start a hybrid of my own just gotta decide which spot to clear on my character selection screen =D<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Continuing to try to fire off that verbal diarrhea eh Bein?<P>Well here goes. You spewed:<P>"Apollohades, after reading cleric related posts the last few weeks it's obvious that clerics in general are the biggest whining cry babies of them all."<P>Oh is that why shaman and druids like yourself are complaining that clerics are "taking all the healer spots?" Is that why you're crying like a school girl in the principle's office? Is that why you're ranting and moaning about getting better heals? And you have the nerve to call someone else a whiner? Please read your own posts moron.<P>"Why is that you feel there should be a spot in a group designated for you upon logging?"<P>I never said that, but narrow-minded folks like yourself probably sit around waiting for us clerics to log in, because you're so simplistic to not be able to adjust your play style to do without. Also you may just be as equally uncharismatic in the game as you are here and no cleric wants to touch you since you're obviously incompetent.<P>"Are you angry because you didn't expect to sit on your a$$ medding 90% of the time, that you deserve it because your class is so boring that you can actually watch a movie and talk on the phone at the same time while playing?"<P>Actually I'm having a good time with my cleric. So where are you getting this from? Sounds like something else you're pulling straight out of your arse. Other than your finger that is.<P>"There is no point arguing with people like you."<P>True. To have a battle of wits you must first be armed. I feel it's unfair for me to spank you since I try to be kind to the disadvantaged.<P>"You are an angry little man and I rather do something else. (Like posting annoying one-liners)"<P>Remember, you first flamed me in another thread with one of your pathetic "one liners" and yet you have the gall to call me "an angry little man."<P>You reap what you sow. Don't dally about trying to flame someone then play the "Oh you're just a meanie" card because that doesn't cut it. If you present yourself like an adult, I won't speak to you as though you're a child or crudely as though you're a simpering idiot.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>That's adjusting playstyle.<P>If you're just doing exp, goto a place where you know you won't need a CH. Karnors Ledges and Dogtower don't "mandatorily" need a cleric.<P>(Is that even a word? I'll look it up later.)<P>If you're deadset on loot, look around for a cleric.
