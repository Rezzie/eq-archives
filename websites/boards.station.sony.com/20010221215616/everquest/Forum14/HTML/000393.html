</FONT><HR>About these lists:<P>First and foremost, understand that this is only a list of concerns to be brought to the Live Team.  This is not a list of promises, and I'm certainly not telling you that any or all of these items will be changed or implemented.<P>Also, there are three types of items that I don't have listed here.  Epic Quests, Magic Resistances in Velious and Mid-level quests.  Those three items were mentioned by enough classes that I've pulled them out for separate examination.<P>All items are currently marked with NONE for status.  Obviously we've already started working on some items, you've seen the lists from the patch messages on the Test Server.  I will be updating the status for items early next week to reflect those potential changes and with any responses from the team.  I just wanted to get these lists out to you fresh.<P>I want these lists to be final as you see them now, but I know there will need to be changes made.  So this list is not final.  But if you want something added to or removed from the list, please be convincing about the change.  At this point I don't want to tack on too many more items, since the team is already reviewing the original list.<P>Thanks for the input so far.<P>Alan<P>Druids:<P><BR>ITEM:  Healing.<P>DESCRIPTION:  There is a general consensus that clerics are the only useful healers past 50th level.  Shamans and Druids are supposed to be secondary healers.  But post 50 their spells are too inferior and fizzle too often to be effective as healers at all.  Some suggestions are to move Superior Heal to level 51 (and reduce its fizzle rate) and/or add in a new one at 56th.  Where shamans might be able to use Torpor to fulfill their healing needs, we may need to make a new spell for druids at that level.  We also need to be careful not to make them too good at healing.  That’s the cleric’s turf.  Whatever is done here should also be done with shaman, in some similar fashion (though probably not the same way).<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Charm Animals.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Druids like the idea of being able to charm pets without making them angry.  But this has a ton of gameplay issues attached to it.  Keep in mind that the main drawback to charm is the fact that the animal will be angry at the caster after the spell fades.  Taking that aggro factor out would require some other serious drawbacks or limitations to the spell, even more than the fact that it is limited to animals.  The idea of making them act like enchanter pets might be a worthwhile idea for a limitation (no ability to command the pet).  From one player:  "How about a High level charm animal spell that only works on animals that con kindly or amiable. If the spell works, it says "The wooly mammoth decides to join you", if it fails it says "The wooly mammoth declines your offer".  That would seem to be the spirit of a druid charm animal spell.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  New Druid Rings.<P>DESCRIPTION:  New rings would require redoing whole zones to get graphics in for them.  But some of these ideas might be feasible, especially if we consider a high concentration of trees enough of a nature focus for a druid to travel to.  Perhaps giving druids access to rings in Surefall Glade, Greater Fay (both of which are druid starting cities, and G Fay already has a ring), Warslik Woods, or perhaps Lesser Fay would make travel easier for them.  These locations make a lot of sense from a story integrity standpoint, the issue here is does it make sense from a gameplay viewpoint.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Spirit of Wolf – II.<P>DESCRIPTION:  A faster Spirit of the Wolf.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  New Appearances.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Druids are one of those classes that are often stuck looking like newbies until fairly late in their careers.  Nobody is expecting new armors and textures to be made up right away, but it should be considered when the next set of new textures is made.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Vermiculated Armor.<P>DESCRIPTION:  The claim is that this armor is too heavy for druid specific armor.<P>STATUS:  None<BR> <BR>---<P>ITEM:  Elder Spiritist Boots.<P>DESCRIPTION:  These boots require a component to use their effect.  It's certainly not traditional that items should require a component ( unless it is supposed to be a severely limited item), and it partially negates the utility of the item.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Quad Kiting.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Because this is a balance issue, it should be looked at.  Is this something that characters should be able to do?  The two classes that seem to be able to do this are wizards and druids.  Perhaps the tactic is hard and time consuming and should be left as is.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Emotes for Wolf Form.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It would be very cool if there were some animated emotes for characters in wolf form.  Wag, sit, howl… stuff like that.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  The 55th level pet.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Assuming that this pet is primarily just for looks and has little combat value, perhaps we could reduce the casting cost a bit.  600 mana seems like a lot.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Succor and Egress.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It appears that these spells do not clear aggro properly.  The main problem seems to be with continuing damage effects (like DoTs) that cause the creature to re-aggro on someone after they have escaped across the zone.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Tunare’s Request.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Players seem to think that this spell should also clear the aggro list, and that it does not.  If it does not, then it seems to be a worse spell than the lower level version.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Fizzling Spells.<P>DESCRIPTION:  These are the spells that seem to fizzle too much:  Breath of Ro, Circle of Summer, Circle of Winter and Superior Heal.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Beguile Plants.<P>DESCRIPTION:  In a fashion similar to Defoliate, this spell is highly limited by the small number of creatures that are actually labeled as plants.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Scale of Wolf and Spirit of Scale.<P>DESCRIPTION:  These spells drops pretty easily and very few people ever use it.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Ro’s Fiery Sundering.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Players don't think the scroll for this spell drops frequently enough.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Group Treeform.<P>STATUS:  A group version of the Treeform spell.<P>STATUS:  N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Good idea on making druid pets act like animations.  That would keep the non-aggro idea balanced.<P>Bad idea on the healing - Sup Heal needs to be moved lower to lvl 44 or 49.<P>Nothing at all in here about making druids more group friendly, (except the heal),  just a bunch of cutesie wishlist items.  Are you sure you guys read *all* of the posts from the threads?  Seems to be there were some good ideas to make Druids more group-friendly.<P>If you can make Necros (best solo class) "group-friendly", then it should be a cakewalk for you to do the same with Druids.<P>Oh, and could we please have a decent ICE DD?

</FONT><HR>SoW 2 would be a great idea! The idea that mobs are tuned to SoW may be true, but lots of dungeons and mobs were designed to have the max mana regen be clarity, and now we have clarity 2. If SoW 2 is made available at 52 or 53, where dr00ds don't hunt much in outside zones, the exception being the more advanced outside velious zones where the mobs are so uber that outrunning them wouldn't make much of a difference, I don't think it would impact game balance much.

</FONT><HR>{snip}<P>ITEM: Quad Kiting.<P>DESCRIPTION: Because this is a balance issue, it should be looked at. Is this something that characters should be able to do? The two classes that seem to be able to do this are wizards and druids. Perhaps the tactic is hard and time consuming and should be left as is.<P>{snip}<P>Druids/wizards aren't the only ones that quad kite.  Bards also can..and a few other classes I believe.<P>Sorry, couldn't resist this one...the tactic is hard and time consuming and should be left as is?  Every druid I have 'ever' talked to that was honest, has flat out told me, the ONLY way they ever die is due to lag or LD.  (ok with the recent crappy connections everyone has been having it's more of an issue...but that's another problem entirely)  Any druid with high +wis and a few hours can learn to quad kite till there's no tomorrow.  Doesn't require much talent and the druids I've talked to have said as much.  The downtime is negligible compared to the exp gain.  Yeah they sit there for 10mins regaining mana, less if they have clarity/clarity 2.<P>If it weren't unbalanced, you'd not have druids saying....No, I don't wanna group, I make more exp/cash quad kiting than I ever could grouping.  <P>I'm not advocating a change that will negatively impact druids as a class and for grouping.  I've said for a long time though that 'something' needs fixed when it comes to 'quadding' and soloing.  (and druid isn't the only class mind you that can quad-kite)<P>The one change I thought of that wouldn't overly affect grouping, but would make quad-kiting more difficult is to make regular snare last up to max 2-3mins.  Make ensnare and it's upgrades have a longer 'potential' duration...but a variable duration with a set minimum.  The problem isn't regular snare, but the snare upgrades cuz quad kiting was rarely happening prior to them fixing ensnare durations.<P>Example:<P>Druid casts ensnare.  That ensnare will last a minimum of 3mins, with a max of 10mins (the current duration).  It could wear off any time during that time.  This makes it still useful for a grouping situation, cuz any group will kill the monster long before the snare wears off.  It will make the 'gathering' of 4 monsters together in a tight huddle so the druid can AE them to death more difficult, as an ensnare 'could' wear off at any time after 3mins.<P>Such a change should be implemented for wizard AE snares as well, and other classes that quad kite. (bard comes to mind but seems there was one other that could do it also...tired/dont remember)<P>These changes would make quad kiting, 'possible'...just not as brainless and mindnumbingly easy.<P>Mindreaver *<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>QUAD KITING<P>I am only 32 and I haven't had the pleasure of Quad Kiting, but as I've heard it, it balances out in the fact it drains mana to the very bottom of your mana pool.  It would make sense that some say its unbalancing but I feel that this is not so.  By the time one druid kills 4 blue mobs (while increasing danger factor by the agro ranges), a well oiled group can kill that many red mobs, and already have their rangers out pulling more.  It evens out very well.

</FONT><HR>On the idea of SoW 2. Adding a faster version of SoW will only increase the ability of druids to kite critters, as the scale types already handle all travel specific needs. However a creative way to impliment a useful yet not horribly unbalancing SoW 2 would be to make it Superior Spirit of Wolf, or an indoor version. Most dungeons are comprised of tight tunnels, plenty of doors and buildings and the like. Basically SSoW (Superior Spirit of Wolf) would make druids more group friendly, as the pullers with get beat on that much less whilst pulling to the group. Also, although I know nobody could possibly program a frog to be as smart as a human, so they were given superior abilities to be able to kill better than any PC, it still disheartens me to see a frog be able to cast SoW indoors and not our real druids.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I thought I'd post on the quad kiting issue .. I have a High 55+ wizzie friend who quads on occasion in Skyfire.  <BR>Everyone is looking at nerfing snare.. but failing to see an importantant issue .. Some mobs don't run at sow speed... ANY caster with an AoE spell and jboots can effectively quad kite .. I have no issues with quad kiting .. I'm saying nerfing snares isn't the answer.  Because sow/jboots is a form of snare if you think about it anyway .. It's really too late in the game mechanics to remove quad kiting .. It would involve removing sow... I'm sure druids as well as shamen would have and issue with this. Removel of AoE dd's .. again 3 classes aren't gonna like this much at all.. Or adjusting snare which will have no impact on quad kiting .. The reason a lot of people quad in the first place is just lack of being able to find a pickup group. Kunark is getting flooded more and more with group ... only so many can be in the warlord room in Karnors getting exp, and those same people won't move to velious ... Why ? .. Velious is designed for the uber guild to do .. I've looked at some of the quest from there and very few worthwile quest are doable by 1 person .. or even a small group .. That is the reason a lot of people witht the ablility to quad are doing so .. I don't recall seeing Skyfire on the list of exp zone mod increases.. yet it's where a LOT of people hunt at on my server .. these same people don't do exp in Karnors becaus it requires going too deep in and hence greater risk of dying because safer mobs closer to the zone are green now and don't give exp.  Just more selection of blue cons in areas where quad kiting is possible.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A few missing items:<P>1. Is it true that Shamen can cast Bearform indoors while we cannot cast wolfform indoors? What is the logic for this?<P>2. With all due respect I think the VAST majority of people suggested Superior Heal for 44 or 49 - I saw nowhere was it suggested 51. While I like 51 better than 53 it does nothing for those poor druids on high level raids under 51.<P>3. I think a common suggestion regarding ports was to eliminate the kunark dungeon requirement in addition to adding a port or two to areas seldom used and considered a waste by many. I see no reason now (before when Kunark was new maybe) to make it exceedingly hard to get to zones in Kunark nor do I see a roleplay reason why a certain spell would only work indoors in a certain land and not others.<P>4. Some of the ideas were not explained. For Example... Why do we think Verm is too heavy? Well maybe because it is as heavy or heavier than warrior armor! Think that might help  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>5. Charm Plants? Where? Why? Has anyone even bothered to do the quest to even get this spell?<P>6. Charm Amimals? Do I have to list all the animals that Verant does not think are animals? And limiting the charm only to animals that con friendly to us is a waste as VERY few zones have aniamls that we can charm that will attack for us. These "greens" will not attack higher mobs so what is the point? The roleplay idea does not make sense in regards to why would we have to "charm" our friend in order to help us? What is really sad is that other classes have spells that are useless but few clases have ENTIRE lines of useless spells. Which brings me to:<P>7. Anti-Summoning Nukes.... I saw many mention it but it did not make the list. Any particular reason why our Special Anti-Summoning line of spells does LESS damage and a worse mana ratio than our standard spells? These are specialized spells that can only be used on certain mobs yet the ENTIRE line is next to worthless.<P>8. I have to agree with the other posters... while Superior heal is very nice addition to help us in groups it would be nice if a few of our group spells stacked. I know we mentioned it but it did not make the list. You dont even have to give us new spells... just allow SLN to stack so on raids we can contribute instead of watching the clerics buff as their buffs overwrite SLN.<P>In closing I think that we might need another look as we were the first class looked at in this class talk and I see the subject evolved as it went from class to class. I see lots of "fluff" - well nice fluff LOL but fluff never-the-less that made the list while important stuff did not.<P>I would MUCH rather have SLN stack or get rid of the Dungeon only evacs than have more Wolf animations LOL. I know I mentioned that the real problem with Druids post 50 was that the spells we get, while very good, need to be balanced and have their mana cost as well as the level they are obtained looked into.<P>Thanks for the time and effort to look into our class.<P>and PS... Does Group Invis exist?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ok, I would like to reiterate that there is another option to fixing the charm concerns. Which is COMPLETELY removing the line and inplace make a charm SKILL. This skill could either be like LoH\HT or it could be like Mend. Both have advantages and disadvantages that the Dev Team could pound out.<BR>One of the reasons druids don't like the charm line is that we dont feel animals should aggro on you after charm drops for roleplay reasons. You, Verant, feel it would be a gameplay problem for them not to do so. Additionally, our spells shouldn't be forcing an animal into submission though magic (such as the enchanter would) but "befriending" it. Thus the skill come in. If an animal is befriended it will stay your "pet" (either controlable or not) until either you die\zone or it dies. The "charm" won't wear off therefor you, Verant, do not have to concern yourselves with the balance issues of that, only the reset time on such a skill. Finally this would make druids unique!! I CAN'T stress this enough....it will make us UNIQUE!! Which is something our class desperately needs.<BR>Now, this isn't a flawless idea. There are just as many cons as there are pros. All I ask is that it be added to the list to be brought up and suggested.<BR>thankyou<P>Druids: PLEASE SUPPORT THIS IDEA!!<P>Amarok Windburn<BR>Druid of Tunare<BR>40th season<BR>Heroes of the Avatar<BR>Tallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Drakewyn:  Thanks for the insult. Enjoy that nice email.<P>Anyway, the rain spells aren't too useful. Maybe un-nerf the AE thing and make it an unlimited amount of NPCs. Yeah....<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
