</FONT><HR>Brain Bite quest isnt that difficult, and you dont need to kill the Black Reavers to get the one in CoM. However you need to have at least a Enchanter with Gravity Flux to be able to do it. This part of the quest was actually the most fun IMO.<P>The Skeleton in KC is the Hardest, but its not overly difficult if you talk people into helping you out at the zone in, If you are lucky and someone is camping the Hand Room, and then if you can find a ecsort to the Hand Room, you could have the Human Skeleton pulled to the Hand Room and Charmed, and it will despawn after you turn in the bottle. If your bold and crasy, you can march into the jail after all the mobs have been pulled and hand the bottle to the mob, and if you dont agro him he will not despawn.<P>TT skeleton is very easy to get to, just get a SOW if you dont have Jboots and you are likely able to outrun anything that agros you, short of a named, like Doom that summons and stuns you to death, to top it off the mob is next to the zone wall, it doesnt get any easyier then that.<P>Quest is difficult enough that in the end you have fun once you get it, and the spell isnt totally worthless, like 90 percent of the other spells you have in your book.<P>Think the spell should be left alone.<P>As for the Imbue Fire Opal spell, I could careless, why not just sell the thing in Sol Temple.(hehe, I cant use it, and I dont care.)<P>However, wheres my Cazic Skin, all the rest of this quest I can handle, but that is Golden BS(tm).<P>How about this for Cazic Skin, you have to wait till his corpse rots, and his corpse turns into Cazic Skin, so at least one something, would have to rot on Cazic corpse, be it the Crimson Robe or some crappy Words or Runes.<P>Wrong thread, but a total change to the Mage Quest is in order as well.<P>57 wizard of the nameless<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Bond of Force is the best snare spell a wizard gets, because Atol's currently fizzles to much. Indoors these spells have the added discomfort of snaring yourself in close quarters unless you maintain your MR at 100+.<P>So single target snare spell that lasts at least as long as BoF, would be benefit, as long as the BoF isnt changed, what im saying is that I would like to see Atol's nerfed, before I saw Bonds of Force nerfed.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>....pretty disappointed that he didnt' point out the most important issue.  GROUP!! I'm a 53wiz and I have been in seb more then 10 time,  I only grouped 2 during those 10 time.  Either i park my wiz there for like 2 hours with LFG on.  But still no one will take me in their group.  Ok a couple min later bunch of ppl showed up.  They all formed group and ready to go in and hunt in seb.  But leaving only me sitting at the zone in point still with my lfg sign on =(.  i think is time for me to retire my wiz.  I'm just getting tired of sitting for 2 hours trying to lfg and I'm getting tell from other asking for tp which is really anonying.  Why ask us for tp when u can ask a druid since they have the nices location and more tp then us.  We wiz are nothing but a backup taxi in the game.  And I thought Everquest is a group base game.  But i guess i'm wrong.  <P><BR>PS: i really like the idea of group harvest.  <BR>druid-group sow<BR>cleric-group buff<BR>enchanter-group clarity<BR>shaman- not sure havent' group with them yet at high lvl.<BR>And I heard that necro is gonna get group dmf too.  With group harvest (fixed one) I think lots of people would like us in their group.  However do make the casting time shorter and give atlease 2 bubble of mana.  Cuz with 10min recast and a 10sec stun and only give u less then a bub of mana is sure not worth the slot for this spell.  When the wiz cast this spell only the wiz who will get stunned not the rest.  Come on verant let us contribute some of our power to group.  We don't do jack but wait,nuke,sit,nuke. Med for like 12min with group member asking you are you fm yet?<BR>And what the hell is the blink spell?  That don't do anything to balance our class!!!  you better open up a can of woop ass dictionary and look up the meaning of balance.  I really really dont' understand why you even have this spell in the list.  <P>PS: about the pointy hat u point out in the very beginging.  IS NOT FUNNY!! Cuz in my opinion I just dont' think you take this class balance talk very seriously.  Yeah i know you spend alot of time reading other post.  But please be serious about the class balance talk.  Alot of people have spend alot of time and posted some really good idea and I'm very dissapointed that you didnt' even list them.  Look like we wizard are gonna get screw again.  Probably they just gonna give us a 2% fix.  And thinking that all wizard will be very happy with another useless spell alike shawdown step.   I really wanted to know do you ever play a wizard before?  I dont' think you're gonna like it when you are the first one arrive at a camping spot waiting for group and those who come late still manage to get a group and you see them all buff up and ready to go in battle.  And you and your sorry butt sitting there lonely knowing that YOU ARE A VERY USELESS WHEN IT COME TO GROUP! NOBODY WANT YOU.  And then when they are done they will come back and ask us for a port to the desination they want.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Fade/ Shadowstep/ Yonder - Who cares if they go up or not. Sure it would be nice if they when up, but I have never used them because regardless if I go up or down, no matter what spell you use your likely to end up inches from where you where previously, or if you manage to go a few feet away the mob runs you down before you can react.<P>More importantly, I think that they should remove the caster from the mobs agro list, the chance from it to re-agro would depend on how far away from the mob you traveled. So basically if you keep attacking said critter if you are not KoS you are likely going to be very soon anyway, to the point if it sees you its going to want to come kill you anyway.<P>This sounds very much like what the Bink line of spells might do, so why have both?<P>Speaking of this topic of agro-lists, the enchanter or anyother class Mem-blur spell should not entirely wipe a mobs memory, as this is just a KS spell then. It would be better to have the Mem-blur spell only remove the enchanters current party members, to avoid KS disputes, and still maintain the spells original design.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Al'Kabor line of spells are worthless, even adding another target, and with a stun effect.<P>Adding another target to the spell isnt going to make me use this spell, it costs twice as much as the pillar spells and does the same amount of damage.<P><BR>2 casts "Pillar of Anything" = 6 targets(3 each time)<P>1 cast of "Al'Krapper of Pour'Kabor"= 5 targets(4 currently)<P>Mana cost would be the same, yet I still do less damage total then before.<P>If you add a stun factor to the "Al'Krappers of Pour'Kabor" now you made then even worse then they where before. Stuns add a resist check, and increase Agro if resisted totally or not. Agroing mobs in a AE group is a bad thing, increasing the resist rate is worse.<P>So bottomline on the "Al'Krappers of Pour'Kabor" line, adding a mob and a stun effect, still makes them worthless, becuase they cost WAY TO MUCH MANA.<P>Cut the mana in half or remove the spells(they are a joke to Al'Kabors name sake).<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm just gonna sit back and wait to see what happens on Test before spamming up these threads any further.<P>Have to admit I'm a bit skeptical because the balance problems of the wizard class were just as BLATANT 2 years ago as they are now.  It's hard to imagine that the tuning team would suddenly have an epiphany about the wizard class after such a long time.<P>The real stunner is how they designed Velious.  I cannot imagine anybody, Vision Disciple or not, playing a wizard in Velious and feeling satisfied with the class during the testing phase.  Were the testers perfectly happy doing .00000001% of the damage on every 10th mob pulled?  The same goes for high level Kunark dungeons, on a slightly smaller scale.<P>For that matter, has anybody at Verant started a wizard from scratch recently?  Even with low level damage caps, melee twinks are doing such massive damage they can probably outdamage wizards on full burn.  Only meleers don't have to sit down and med afterward.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Quad Kiting - Absor go give this a try for yourself. Think you will agree its not a balance issue, if you can do it, more power to you, but 90 percent of the population thinks it more trouble then its worth, but it I feel it would be a bigger wrong to take it away from those people who actually like doing it, and we are only talking about 2 classes that can do it.<P>The best indication of this is looking at how many Wizards you see Quad Kiting everything, and how many are LFG in a dungeon. Most wizards soloing are not Quad kiting, due to the hastles.<P>The ability to do it, or not to do it should not be a factor that determines if we perform well against 1 target or 4 targets.<P>Many wizards feel that are ability to Quad kite is the reason we fall so short in terms of actual damage output on one mob, and the resulting downtime that corresponds.<P>I would like to think this would not be the case, but if it is, there need to be significant improvements in the ability for Quad Kiting to be done. Currently this isnt a easy thing to do, and requires quite alot of practice to perfect, and is border-line something that is actually worth the time doing. As getting a group, yeilds as good if not better exp and loot in the end.<P>I would personnally would be willing to give up this ability to Quad kite if it would mean Verant would make a ultimate 4 fold improvement to are Mana Regen rate.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Percentage Damage, is not something I have been a huge fan of, these spells due to there natural high damage rates, would likely yeild high resist rates, uber taunting, and possibly high mana costs, all of which would have to be controlled by some means, typically against these types of creatures, agroing one means certain death to casters, a skill im not fond of, but already quite good at.<P>Perhaps my biggest concern with these types of spells is that they address Velious uber mobs, but do nothing to fix everyday experience grind groups, where I spend 100.00 percent of experience gaining career.<P>If it was a choice between this and faster mana regen, Id take faster mana regen, maybe its just me trying to learn from are necro partners, telling us that instant damage isnt everything.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It seems like this list at least mentions all of the major areas we've been concerned about. <P>My only advice: Whatever you do Verant, please don't nerf the class. Don't remove quad kiting (although I've never done it) and don't remove Invis Undead (which I just paid 1800pp for). I suspect you'll satisfy a much greater number of us by making a few improvements and not nerfing anything rather than making a lot of changes and nerfing our existing abilities.<P>Endaar Flaashpoint<BR>&lt;The Valorous&gt;<BR>51 Wiz, Karana<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Mana regen is would be the best and easiest way to fix the biggest balance problem that there currently is with being a wizard.<P>Spell Efficency is one thing, but if you have the means of regaining the mana you lost at a faster rate you improve the efficency of every spell in your book you can cast, or any spell you might get in the future.<P>Currently a Wizard has a enough mana, and a efficency good enough to solo almost any blue con mob.(with the exception of Velious mobs). The problem is not so much what happens during the battle, though resists and fizzles, can ruin your day, its what happens after the battle. As a wizard your very likely at the end of any battle to have up around 13 minutes of Downtime, when a wizard is in a group, the amount of damage on the mobs doesnt magically get less, nor does the wizards damage output significantly improve even with a enchanter and a bard. Thats the problem, while the other classes are able to fall back on other skills none mana related, wizards are stuck on there butts missing alot of opertunities that they could have been otherwise adding damage, which was there original design, so we where all lead to believe.<P>1. Giving us Clarity II self of group buff isnt going to be a significant change.<P>2. Ramping Harvest up post 50 isnt going to help either.<P>3. Built in Mana song bard "pet" not going to a big enough change either.<P>With the current resist, fizzle, and over-all efficency of the spells we have, left the same as is, for me to personnally feel satisifed with my damage output. I would need a Mana regen rate as follows.<P>2x - 20+<BR>3x - 40+<BR>4x - 60<P>Even though this sounds like alot its not that unrealistic, when you consider, the pet being a continious source of melee damage, basically the most mana efficent DoTs in the game, with the ability to defend their masters and transfer to other targets.<P>Or when you look at the fact that healing spells are to a Melee class the same to a wizard as a complete restoration of a empty Mana bar.<P>Currently the 13 minutes of downtime is killing the wizard class, fixing it as described above doesnt make us solo none stop pulling machines, though in a group, there should be a significant improvement to are Damage output over time.<P>1x = 13 minutes (current)<BR>2x = 6 1/2 minutes of downtime<BR>3x = 4 1/2 minutes of downtime<BR>4x = 3 1/4 minutes of downtime (keep in mind this is at lvl 60, past the exp cruch, when it shouldnt be a bear to play the class, but fun.)<P>Well there are all my thoughts on the current list as it is. Guess Ill stop spamming the board and wait to see whats actually done, just like the rest of us, die hard wizards.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Again, here's a perfect example of wizards being damaged in general because a few wizards can quad kite specific types of mobs.  What about the wizard who uses Bonds of Force to actually help out his teammates?  Tonight, I was doing blue/black/yellow Tizmaks in Velious w/ a team of some higher and one lower:  Wizard 29 (me), Wizard 36 (Guildmate), Shaman 39 (Guildmate), Enchanter 28 (Guildmate.)  <P><BR>We were pulling 5 or 6 or 7 Tizmaks at a time...and when they were coming up to us, I used AE snare....then me and my Wizard companion used AEs to rock them down (course I used Column Lightning...4 mobs max)....and we FRIED trains fast.  VERY fast...we pulled about 7 or 9 once...i was about 50% mana....contributed ALOT to the battle...and just ran around those few that taunted off on me so that I could blast the main section of mobs on my tank w/ AEs.  <P><BR>Ok, you wanted wizards to learn how to use their AEs...i'm getting really good at it.  I just hit 29, so 2day was the first day using Bonds of Force...DON'T remove this spell...it's unique in it's AE purpose and it helps the team immensely.<P><BR>Another example: Later that night, my guildmates mainly disbanded (Ulthoks we were fighting in EW)...and only 4 were left of the group tanks gone.  An Ulthok attacked our shaman....(he was in group w/ the other wizard as we were rdy to TP out 2 different destinations)...and the Enchanter was grouped w/ me.  Then a walrus hit our enchanter....I was able to AE snare the two things when they both taunted to the SHaman (who was low health)...this bought him time to heal...the Wizard evaced (which I woulda done but there was a nice group bug on my Enchanter friend at the moment....I was desperately trying to get him to group up so that we could evac, when the other 2 left, I knew we were screwed)<P><BR>Finally the group bug somehow fixing itself, he ran outta my sight....long story short, I evaced, but the BoF spell bought me enuff time...sure I got hit 39 and 12 dmg and I regained concentration...but w/o that spell, I woulda been hit alot more and definitely not got my concentratoin back...I had 1/3 a bub of health when I materilaized in NK.<P><BR>Bonds of Force are a great thing for a wizard...as i'm just getting to understand...don't take it away because some wizards use it 2 quad kite....this time, make the wizard work then go back and FIX the ability to solo (not thru nerfing of the spells...but some other way that won't cripple the wizard in battles.)<P>Krytal.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>All right, I've read the majority of the original discussion on the general discussion board and most of this one too and I think it's time I put my 2cp in...I've not reached the 'pinnacle' of sorcery yet (I'm level 34 now) so I'm operating on the assumption that wizards need balancing in the pre-50 game as well as post-50. Keep that in mind when reading my post.<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Increased mana regeneration.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>I think that increased mana regen for all casters has potential. As you said in another thread, you would have to change the effectiveness of the Clarity line so it wouldn't be overpowered. You would also have to consider other mana-regen lines such as the necro Lich series, bard songs, and Harvest.  <P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Spell efficiency.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>Honestly, I think that our spell efficiency is about right in most cases. Other classes', namely magicians, aren't (again, IMO). However, the way I'm going with this isn't going to happen...I hope. It would include 'nerfing' other DD classes and no one wants that to happen. I think efficiency could be improved by a slight tweaking in spell stats to improve our mana-to-damage ratio on almost all DD spells and a reasonable reduction in their resistability. I'm defaulting to the 'master seekers of knowledge' rant in saying that we should know how to get our magical powers through a mob's defenses.<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Percentage Damage Spells.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>From what I hear of Velious uber-mobs, these sound great in most respects. There are potential drawbacks though. These spells will have major taunt side effects if not done right, resulting in a dead wizard...dead wizard BAD  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  In order for these spells to be viable, they would have to have a dmg:mana ratio undesirable for normal non-uber, non-velious mobs (in part to discourage using them for soloing), long enough cast time to help make up for the insane damage being dealt, long recast delay to prevent chain-casting, dying, rememming, rinsing, and repeating, and may have to have lower agro potential than normal nukes.<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Level Cap on spells.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>Definetely agree here. I was just today grouped in Oasis fighting spectres when a 16 warrior asked to join us. We didn't have a full group and decided to let him for the heck of it. This warrior was actually getting a decent amount of hits off given the fact that the mobs he was attacking were over twice his level. All casters should stand some chance of hitting a mob 7 levels above them, which is a much more realistic situation. Enough about that since you seem to agree, just had to tell that cute little story.<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Al'Kabor line of spells.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>I used Al'Kabor at low levels to see what they did. I couldn't figure out for the life of me what they had over other AoEs I had in my book. I've never used them again...hint hint  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Flaming Sword of Xuzl.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>1. I've never used anything like this obviously...  2. Why do we have a pet? I don't care how weak it is or how strong it is, I personally think it shouldn't exist.<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Harvest.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>I think this would be a very wise spell to change into a skill similar to Mend for monks. I think we should have to build up our skill in it and have chances of failing. This would also have the benefit of freeing up a slot in our book. The only other spells I can think of that sit in your spell slots not getting cast is Spirit of Cheetah for druids and evacs for both druids and wizards. Both of these are emergency spells. If you want to live, you have them there to use on those (hopefully) rare occasions. Harvest is a utility spell and I really think it should be made into a utility skill. Heck, I even think it would be fair for you to fail at it and lose mana like Mend.  It's a great spell since I just got it, but I know it's going to lose it's luster over time.<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Rain Spells.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>I don't use these. I think it's more of a fact of me not liking the way they work. Hehe, do what you will with these. I agree that pets shouldn't be included, however, and I think you already have that in the works for a fix.<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Atol's Spectral Shackles.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>Dunno, I'm not level 51  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Snare/Enstill.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>I think it's wise to keep snare as-is. I've tried quad-kiting before and it's no piece of cake to do. I haven't gotten it right yet. The snare is almost always resisted by at least one of the mobs you pull so the AoE aspect of it becomes moot. The AoE aspect of it actually helps druids retain their title of snarers. In a dungeon, it's very easy to snare yourself and maybe even unwanted mezzed mobs. You have to be very selective in how you use this spell. It's not just point and shoot like a single snare. If I got a single target snare, I think I'd feel more powerful with it in most situations. <BR>Minimum duration on Enstill? Wow, that'd be nice...I think that would be a good idea. I usually don't use Enstill at all unless I'm in an open area and need to 'park' extra mobs. I always have my level 4 Root handy however...it'd give me a reason to use the upgrade.<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Invisibility to Undead.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>I understand both sides on this one. I personally think that we shouldn't have it, but many others disagree...<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Teleport - West Karana.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>I really REALLY agree that this should be moved. All that this saves is a 20 second run from the North Karana spires to the zone line as has been reiterated by many others...I'll leave the dead horse alone now.<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Teleport - Cazil Thule Gate.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>It definetely is too dangerous. I lost half a level in trying to recover my corpse from an experimental teleport here at around 30. I had heard it was dangerous when you got the spell, but had no idea it was still that dangerous later. Fyi, once invis starts to drop in that maze, you might as well go up and poke the nearest lizard with your dagger...*sigh*<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Fade, shadowstep and yonder.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>I may be ignorant of this fact, but do outdoor zones have a ceiling? If so, could the spell first toss you up to the ceiling of the zone, horizontally in whatever fashion currently exists, and then drop you down to the ground again? Obviously, you couldn't take damage from that drop...  In dungeons, the way it works now is about as good as it gets I think (although who uses this spell in dungeons?).<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Evacs.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>Link-dead characters evacing with my party would be very good. I can't think of any problems (other than coding. is it easy to make LD characters zone?) off the top of my head.<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Evacs and Abscond.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>Dunno, never used the evacs I have in that fashion and don't have Abscond.<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Abscond.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>Fizzles...dunno again. But, sure! Why not?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Concussion spell scroll.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>I'm really looking forward to this spell. I intend to lose a full level in attempting to get it at 39 before I realize I'm an idiot for trying. I'd say keep it as-is, but I'm not really sure...it's easier for rangers to get Jolt I believe (and maybe their upgrade will go live too?)and rogues get evade innately. They can take hits better than us and are the damage-dealers of the melee world (at least that's my known popular belief)Maybe make the quest somewhat easier or raise the level of the spell? Although I don't know what raising the spell level would accomplish...hmm.<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Melee-proof NPCs.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>Now that'd be fun and interesting. Do it, I dare ya!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Diamond Rod.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>Hehe, I'm gonna go look this item up now...ah, ok. No, no items should need a reagent. The magic is stored in the item, isn't it? So it should also posses the powers of the reagent in it in my opinion.<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Imbue Fire Opal Scroll.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>*shrug* Either solution sounds fine with me. I know I wouldn't risk my butt back at 29 (hehe, and you know it was SOO long ago!) for an enchantment spell.<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Eye of Zomm.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>Brace yourself for blatant sarcasm. I'm sorry in advance...PUT THIS ON TOP OF YOUR LIST MAN!!! Ok, I'm done...sorry again. I use this spell for scaring newbies when I'm bored and nothing else. I think it having low swimming is fine for all intents and purposes. You have to pick your times to use it just like all other things, right?<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Damage spell variety.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>A nuke of each resist every level...that's a lot of spells. If you intend to do that much revamping of our spells, more power to you I suppose. I really didn't think you would go so far as to add new spells at each level and I really don't think you should. I think alternating fire, ice, fire, ice every spell rank would be good. Throw in a magic and a 'special' DD every so often and I think you can call it good if you're going to do this...<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Critical Hits with Spells.&gt;&gt;&gt;<P><BR>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Target too low level bug.&gt;&gt;&gt;<P><BR>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Quad Kiting.&gt;&gt;&gt;<P><BR>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Suppression spells.&gt;&gt;&gt;<P><BR>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Blink Spell.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

If you want to live, you have them there to use on those (hopefully) rare occasions. Harvest is a utility spell and I really think it should be made into a utility skill. Heck, I even think it would be fair for you to fail at it and lose mana like Mend.  It's a great spell since I just got it, but I know it's going to lose it's luster over time.<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Rain Spells.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>I don't use these. I think it's more of a fact of me not liking the way they work. Hehe, do what you will with these. I agree that pets shouldn't be included, however, and I think you already have that in the works for a fix.<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Atol's Spectral Shackles.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>Dunno, I'm not level 51  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Snare/Enstill.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>I think it's wise to keep snare as-is. I've tried quad-kiting before and it's no piece of cake to do. I haven't gotten it right yet. The snare is almost always resisted by at least one of the mobs you pull so the AoE aspect of it becomes moot. The AoE aspect of it actually helps druids retain their title of snarers. In a dungeon, it's very easy to snare yourself and maybe even unwanted mezzed mobs. You have to be very selective in how you use this spell. It's not just point and shoot like a single snare. If I got a single target snare, I think I'd feel more powerful with it in most situations. <BR>Minimum duration on Enstill? Wow, that'd be nice...I think that would be a good idea. I usually don't use Enstill at all unless I'm in an open area and need to 'park' extra mobs. I always have my level 4 Root handy however...it'd give me a reason to use the upgrade.<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Invisibility to Undead.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>I understand both sides on this one. I personally think that we shouldn't have it, but many others disagree...<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Teleport - West Karana.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>I really REALLY agree that this should be moved. All that this saves is a 20 second run from the North Karana spires to the zone line as has been reiterated by many others...I'll leave the dead horse alone now.<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Teleport - Cazil Thule Gate.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>It definetely is too dangerous. I lost half a level in trying to recover my corpse from an experimental teleport here at around 30. I had heard it was dangerous when you got the spell, but had no idea it was still that dangerous later. Fyi, once invis starts to drop in that maze, you might as well go up and poke the nearest lizard with your dagger...*sigh*<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Fade, shadowstep and yonder.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>I may be ignorant of this fact, but do outdoor zones have a ceiling? If so, could the spell first toss you up to the ceiling of the zone, horizontally in whatever fashion currently exists, and then drop you down to the ground again? Obviously, you couldn't take damage from that drop...  In dungeons, the way it works now is about as good as it gets I think (although who uses this spell in dungeons?).<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Evacs.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>Link-dead characters evacing with my party would be very good. I can't think of any problems (other than coding. is it easy to make LD characters zone?) off the top of my head.<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Evacs and Abscond.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>Dunno, never used the evacs I have in that fashion and don't have Abscond.<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Abscond.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>Fizzles...dunno again. But, sure! Why not?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Concussion spell scroll.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>I'm really looking forward to this spell. I intend to lose a full level in attempting to get it at 39 before I realize I'm an idiot for trying. I'd say keep it as-is, but I'm not really sure...it's easier for rangers to get Jolt I believe (and maybe their upgrade will go live too?)and rogues get evade innately. They can take hits better than us and are the damage-dealers of the melee world (at least that's my known popular belief)Maybe make the quest somewhat easier or raise the level of the spell? Although I don't know what raising the spell level would accomplish...hmm.<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Melee-proof NPCs.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>Now that'd be fun and interesting. Do it, I dare ya!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Diamond Rod.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>Hehe, I'm gonna go look this item up now...ah, ok. No, no items should need a reagent. The magic is stored in the item, isn't it? So it should also posses the powers of the reagent in it in my opinion.<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Imbue Fire Opal Scroll.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>*shrug* Either solution sounds fine with me. I know I wouldn't risk my butt back at 29 (hehe, and you know it was SOO long ago!) for an enchantment spell.<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Eye of Zomm.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>Brace yourself for blatant sarcasm. I'm sorry in advance...PUT THIS ON TOP OF YOUR LIST MAN!!! Ok, I'm done...sorry again. I use this spell for scaring newbies when I'm bored and nothing else. I think it having low swimming is fine for all intents and purposes. You have to pick your times to use it just like all other things, right?<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Damage spell variety.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>A nuke of each resist every level...that's a lot of spells. If you intend to do that much revamping of our spells, more power to you I suppose. I really didn't think you would go so far as to add new spells at each level and I really don't think you should. I think alternating fire, ice, fire, ice every spell rank would be good. Throw in a magic and a 'special' DD every so often and I think you can call it good if you're going to do this...<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Critical Hits with Spells.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>Definetely! Also along these lines, would it be viable for us to get some sort of message telling when our specialization works? Honestly, I've never ever noticed a specialization taking action...<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Target too low level bug.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>Ok, you got that one down.<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Quad Kiting.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>It is hard and time-consuming. As I said before, I haven't gotten it right yet. I think it should be left as-is personally.<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Suppression spells.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>Interesting, but I don't think it fits in with my personal vision of a wizard. This should be more along the lines of a shaman or enchanter maybe?<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ITEM: Blink Spell.&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>Again, interesting. I think this fits us if it fits anyone.<P>I know I had at least a couple of miscellaneous comments, but I've forgotten them at the moment. If I remember them, I'll post later.

</FONT><HR>I like the vast majority of what I'm hearing, however Jim69 hit the nail on the head about quad-kiting. Bottom line, quad kiting is very tough to learn, but in exachange provides a nice way to gain exp when you can't get a group.<P>It absolutely requires items like Jboots and the flux staff, and even the AE spells that need to be used to pull it off are either mob-droppped or research (for those doing lower level versions of it).<P>I don't think any of us want a single-target snare, well I guess it wouldn't hurt but definitely DON'T change/remove Bonds of Force and Atol's Spectral Shackles... we like em =0 (hell its one of the few things we DO like these days =0)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Also add that tanks get haste items to have them do their damage faster. If you gave a caster a haste item he would just be OOM faster as the casters damage (save for pets and damageshields) is finite and tied to his mana while the melees damage is infinite and only a cheal away from continuity.<BR>They get new weapons every day to do massive damage and haste items to do that damage faster and mroe frequvently. And as you said their old, but still uber, items trickle down the levels and brings the unbalance to low levels. Nowadays casters are outmatched by melee in all levels thanks to twinks and mudflation economies with melee gear.<P>Thats another problem. The efficiensy of healing. Clerics can after lvl 39 fully heal ANY melee tank to full no matter how many HPs he have with 400 mana. This will ultimately make the clerics the only choise for healing and make the tanks damage infinite and a cleric tank combination can beat any foe so the game is balanced uppon that combination.<P>There is no Full mana heal in the game. So there we have a problem. The tanks can do infinite damage while casters can not, mostly thanks to C heal making the situation out of hand. This have already put Casters at a support role. We are contributing through the eventual infinite melee damage we can do (pets and damshields) and by the spells we can cast on the tanks to help keeping them doing their infinite damage.<P>This is where the damage casters gets severely hurt, Wizards the worst as wizards ONLY ability is doing finite magical damage and HAS no other means of contribution in infinite damage like through a pet or damageshields like all other casters have.<P>So wizards have already been rendered useless by this. Some have not yet realised that they can get immensly more exp with a melee group than with having casters in the group but with more game experience they realise it too and thats one less group for a caster and especialy one less for wizards as wizards are totaly useless.<P><BR>THIS is the reason wizards need a COMPLETE revamp as we have no spot in this game.<P>Sorasil Lorewind<BR>lvl60 Sorcerer<BR>Paradigm<BR>Solusek Ro<P>Enathil Dorekan<BR>52 Magician<BR>E. Mar<P> <BR>-Sorasil-<BR>Station Member   posted 02-17-2001 01:13 PM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Forgot to add that Melee tanks are damage TAKERS also something casters are not. So even IF casters could do massive damage like melee casters would die due to inability to take damage.<BR>This have brought the ancient caster/melee system out of play long time ago. It used to be Melee that was TAKING damage and keeping mobs away from the casters that was the DEALERS of damage. In everquest melee tanks do BOTH jobs now rendering casters useless.<BR> <BR>Right now i see the other caster classes demnading a % damage nuke. If they are to get that also they have to sacrifice their pet, damageshields and all groupfriendly spells they have. Its that simple. Because a mage does 0.2 less damage per mana compared to awizard and a druid does 0.1 damage per mana less and that differance is negliable. Then add their pets continious damage and their damageshield damage to this and wizard will look as useless at paper as they are in reality.<P><BR>Sorasil Lorewind<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>For the most part I am excited to see what improvements we get when all is said and done.  I do hope that BOF continues to be an AOE spell.  If you want to give us a single target snare at lower levels great, but don't change BOF.  I don't use BOF for quad kiting (to dangerous for me, and I am a grouper), but I do use if for crowd control when my group does not have an enchanter.  With root, and BOF I can help keep mobs off casters and it lets the group run if we get in over our heads.<P>We need to be able to do a lot of damage, and do it over a long period of time.  That is what we are for.  We are suppose to be straight up magical firepower.  If we are out of mana after every fight, or we hold back so we don't use much mana, the group is not killing as efficiently as they should be, and we are not contributing enough to the group.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

If wizards are specialized in doing damage, then why not give them critical hits with damage spells? The critical could be more damage, a stun, or some other effect.<P>STATUS: None[/quote]<P>Just a slight comment on this one.  I am not sure that we want our "criticals" if given to us, to do extra damage.  Unless that extra damage dosen't add to the creature agro.  Personally for a Wizard I think a Critical should do normal damage but take zero mana, or very little.<P>The second thing is the IU spell we get.  I wouldn't mind hearing a reasoning of why we get it, from verants point of view.  However, peronally I can think of one reason why we get the spell.  As Seakers of knowledge we must be able to venture into areas to do our research.  Its high level, its self only, I don't consider it unbalancing, but if verant were to nix it I wouldn't be upset with them for it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Thanks for your list, Absor.  And double thanks for staying up late to post it.  Despite the many negative comments the list is receiving, I believe all of us wizards appreciate seeing it.<P>A couple of points I would like to add, if I may ...<P>ITEM: Harvest.<P>DESCRIPTION: ... There is a definite bug with the icon timer.  It pops every time I right-click my jboots from a HotBox slot.<P>ITEM: Evac Spells<P>DESCRIPTION: ... Most of us wizards don't use Evac spells as designed; we use them as alternate portal locations.  For example, I use my Evac Ro spell to port groups to SRo all the time for Fear raids.  I have never used Evac Ro as an evac from a dungeon or Planar zone.<P>Hope this helps ...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I wanted to answer to each point, so I made a web page on my site for nicer reading (and to allow my readers easy access to it):<P>http://perso.wanadoo.fr/nicolbolas/changes.html<P>I think that Absor's on the right track on the whole, but most things have a meaningful purpose in this game and he's missing some. I'm curious to see what the outcome of this "big ears" policy will be.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I did a Ctrl-F (find) on that quotation, and found only 1 instance - yours Sinneed. So who said that? Must be someone if it was between " ".<P>I do not think anyone thinks that. I sure as heck don't. One of my sentences came close to saying that, but close only counts in horseshoes and grenades.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> And that was not the intention of my post in the least.<P><BR>Anyways, that is getting off the subject ...in case my original points got flushed down the toilet b/c of the last few posts:<P>=========================<BR>Suggestions for List:<BR>=========================<BR> - Remove Item: Blink <BR> - Remove Item: Bonds of Force - fine as is<P> - Add Item: Look at resist tables for Wizard class, post 35 does not seem to live up to promise.<P> - Add Item: Look into minimum damage for Wizard spells. If this is done than resist tables are probably fine as is.<P> - Add Item: Look into making Lures UNresistable. Their mana/dmg ratio efficiency should be the balancing act, not the resist factor.<P> - Change Item: Cazic-Thule personal gate. Move to higher level, problem solved. In response, moving Common Portal down to level 34 would be nice ...not needed but definately nice.<P><BR>Some of other issues I agree w/ are stated better by others so I will not even attempt it.<P>Thanks for listening,<BR>Shenlung<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 13 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-11.html">11</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-12.html">12</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-13.html">13</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000784&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000784&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
