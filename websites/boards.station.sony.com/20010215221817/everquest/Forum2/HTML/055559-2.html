Stupidity, however, has.<P>In terms of real people sitting at a computer screen playing EQ, no one has ever been killed, by stupidy or otherwise.  Many people have been profaned and offended. <P>Verant is wise enough to understand that. That is why there are rule against profanity and none against stupidity.<P>Poking a Sand Giant at level 10 is stupid.  But it also fun to do once.  So again, some attempt to make another valid action in EQ sound bad with their venomous attitude.

</FONT><HR>Xula,<P>What you suggest is ideal, but impractical.  The essential problem is that some things will look fine when one person looks, then someone else sees it and interprets it differently, and all heck breaks loose.<P>Take, for example, the title of the South Park Movie.  The original title was to be "South Park Goes to Hell."  The MPAA vetoed this.  So they come back with "South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut."  Apparently no one on the MPAA has ever been to a video store that carries pornos, because they saw nothing wrong with it.<P>This I found hilarious.  Then I started to find it nearly disturbing when I discovered that at least two friends of mine, who were not so ingenuous, had not realized the connotation of the title until I pointed it out.<P>It would be entirely possible for someone to choose a name that would seem innocouous enough to the GM who first reviewed it, but then would be seen by a player who "got it", and would find it offensive.  This is the problem of language... it is subject to interpretation.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well Babs to answer your question...<BR>I didn't realize it till after I was already playing for a couple of hours when someone asked me where my last name went.  I then tried to /surname Moorehead to put it back and it was bugged so then I contacted a GM and then asked him to give me the sirname Buffs.

</FONT><HR>The problem, as illustrated, is that GMs are anal retentive; for whatever reason.<P>After an LOA of 3 months from the guide program, I petition for GM in an effort to inquire about how I would start again.  I was then given a verbal thrashing about the rule-book, issued a "verbal" warning, and told to never do such thing again over the petition system.<P>Needless to say I have no urge to join the guide program again.  And in fact, I'm sure this message will be deleted by Verant (if not my account).

</FONT><HR>Above all else I am more disturbed by the inconsistency in the policy.  Starwolfe-DP's log shows him saying a GM gave him the surname.  If this is true, what happened?  Can a GM just go and change what another(Head GM) deemed "OK"?  Something is ok UNLESS someone else doesn't like it?  Today one GM gives you a Surname, and tomorrow you get a warning for it by another GM?  Someone screwed up if you asked me.  Either the first GM didn't know what he was doing or the second one made a bad call.  <P>I also have one question I would like answered by Absor or anyone here. <BR>-Why did that GM NOT allow or facilitate a contact between Starwolfe-DP and the Lead GM who is alleged to have given the OK for the name change?  Or is there a reason for this Lead GM not wanting to speak to him?  If there is going to be such a drastic change to a persons character, don't we at least deserve to get to talk to the LEAD GM for confirmation?  If a GM comes to me and tells me the order came from above, I WANT to talk to whom ever gave the command.  Why should I just be shrugged off?  <P>I believe the GM was just pushing it a tad.  And one more thing, I don't care WHO you are.  If a GM changes your name for whatever reason(or even tells you he will), it is gonna bother you, especially in a situation where GM's already deemed it ok.  Some people here say the GM was "nice" to Starwolfe-DP.  I think he treated Starwolfe-DP pretty bad and he in turn reciprocated.  Who was losing out here?  Not the GM, he was not losing anything here.  When you tell someone you are going to change their name for no apparent reason, that person is not going to be happy about it.  You cant expect huggs and kisses, especially when they have gotten attached to it.  Even more so when it has apparently been aproved by another GM already; if that is indeed the case here.  I believe some of Starwolfe-DP comments were uncalled for, but he also established some good points which where not (apparently) taken into consideration.  In my opinion the situation could have been dealt with better from both parties.  Nonetheless the only person with any real control and resposibility is the GM.  The customer has no other way of comunicating a problem or a complaint if not through the GMs themselves.  Even if Starwolfe-DP is wrong, he still should have been allowed to speak and/or plead his case with the head GM responsible for the name change if he so wished to.  <P>Then again, GMs seem to be surprised when their fame precedes them.  Wether or not your a good GM, the customer does not know.  With so many horror stories running around, you have to expect that you will not be trusted and/or confided in sometimes.  When this is the case, it is up to the GM to gain the player confidence.  This here does not inspire confidence.  Only the GMs can fix the breach between the players and themselves.  GMs must never forget they are representatives of Verant, wether they like it or not. And they should act accordingly.<P>In the end I think Tigergirl was ok name, and I dont think it should matter if it "is" or "is not" phrase.  Ive seen quite a few names on the same line.  I could mention about 10 names off the top of my head that would qualify.  Id give the name back simply because it was a dumb reason to take the name away IMHO.  Else you should go "purging" all the names on all the servers that go along the same lines.  <P>You know there are names more deserving of removal and in a world where you only get one name, it becomes harder and harder to pick out a good and original name that isn't just a generated garble of letters.<P>I understand why the surname could be offensive tho, and should be removed just to avoid problems.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well to Tholarion, I simply say: &lt;wide grin&gt; I've already been considering switching to AC just to wait for DA to come out. This is my first brush with a GM (other than getting a corpse outta lava, and I fell into the ground zoning into Qeynos Hills once) and it left me pretty much sour.<P>My other 2 contacts with GMs on that server were when I had my original name "Tigergirl Weredaisy" changed to "Tigergirl Ebonmist" in light of an informal wedding. Then finally, when my friend left the server .... I had it switched to "Tigergirl Piddlemaker" ... yes, by a head-GM. I petitioned it, he popped over from another server and did the name on the spot. A smile, a /thank and that was the end of it. Now sometime... months down the road a GM decides to randomly pick on me? I find it quite infair.<P>People call the names I choose "stupid" .... stupid by what meaning? It's original. It's mine. It's not the xenocopied: "Lark Wyndrunner" or "Meadowbrow Sowsalot" or "Softpaw Kindheart" type of names that I -SWEAR TO GOD- I see on every freaking server I go to.<P>Stick to role-play names, some of you have said? Uh. Well, I do role-play ... but that's sorta like learning to speak French on Mars considering everyone else tends to look at me like I'm stupid when I start playing with my dagger and talking to my pet before a fight. <P>Then again, why the bloody heck should I worry about role-playing anyway? This is no longer a role-playing game... I sorta discovered that shortly after my 3rd character. It's a means for some people to make money (E-bay) some sexually-frustrated little boys to release tension (d00ds and PvP during "after school" hours)and for alot of folks... a chance to have some 'cyber sex' with a high-elf enchantress.<P>I am not going to role-play unless I am among friends. &lt;shrugs&gt; Yet the GMs often look at people as if they were stupid for NOT role-playing. Yet, how many GM events do -you- see in a month where there's actual conversations, a story-line... not just... "Oh look, purple Hill-Giants are dropping Rubi in South Karana!" ... in teleports the level 45's. <P>I mean really, I do not bother other people. Just leave me the heck alone, I don't think I've ever been petitioned, I certinally have no warnings (although after that night, I'm not even sure anymore).<P>And no, when I mentioned Brell and Vallon's GMs, it was not a threat, it was a comparison. It was me brushing them off. Although, I could have made myself clearer, I feel that I handled the situation about the best as I could considering the fact that he came INTO the conversation telling me -both- of my names broke the policy. Well who the heck does he think he is? Why is it that I can come back to my server after being sick for five months (note, I've been on that server since it started) ... get my name changed to Piddlemaker ... then another couple months later, I have this hit me. <P>It really sort of makes me lean back in my chair and stare at the screen for a while... re-considering the unopened Diablo II box lying somewhere in my brother's room, and dabbing at tears as I read people tearing into -me- personally for choosing a name that I figure, people are going to remember and distingish me by. Where at in this game, of in a normal day... you'll hear the phrase 'i need sow can u sow?!!?@#" among other things should I -have- to role-play? Where should I -have- to choose a role-playing based name?<P>I guess I'm just not the "Netessa Darkcorpseraiser" type of person. Sorry.<P>- Disgruntled.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>   My worry is how many people need to be offended before you have your name removed like that? For example, I could say I find NetProphet offensive because it offends my religious beliefs in the one and only prophet (insert prophet name here). I petition and a GM shows up and says yes, that's a religious reference (since it's capitalized it refers to the true prophet and not just any generic one, and my "religion" only recognizes one anyway so it's heresy) so your name is changed to Bob.  <BR>   Or, I tell the GM I find your name offensive, and while you're talking I kill your spawn ...<BR>   Or I tell the GM I find your name offensive then use it myself...<BR>   BTW I find nothing offensive about Piddlemaker, maybe a switch to Puddlemaker would have worked but when you get jumped by a GM and told "change now or die" creativeness goes out the window.<BR>   I think if the rule is strictly enforced the ability to choose your own name becomes worthless. I still play paper RPGs (I'm 40) and my friends and I enjoy choosing names almost as much as playing the character. If personally chosen names weren't seen as important to the players they wouldn't be an option, so any changes should be done with more care. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Starwolfe, I'm sorry you don't like other people's opinions.  If you didn't want to hear them, this was the wrong place to post.  Theoretically, you could have put this in "customer service / technical help" (where it would have been more appropriate, considering that you apparently WANTED attention from Verant.  You could have even put this in "wishlist" as a request for a better naming policy.<P>Instead, you put it into the board with the highest traffic, apparently hoping that all of the people who miss no opportunity to slam Verant would jump on the bandwagon and possibly "force" the issue.<P>Your claim that a GM approved your name, if true, doesn't mean squat.  It could have been the FIRST GM who made the mistake when he/she approved your name.  How would the next GM know that?  By scanning the logs?  Why should they?  In *their* judgement, your name violated policy.  Now, while I sympathize regarding the loss of your first name (I don't think that was necessarily justified), and that is the worst part since you are PRIMARILY identified by your first name in the game (last names only show when you are standing next to the person, anyway), I don't sympathize at all with the second.  Your intent was to describe a bodily function, one which *will* irritate some people (most of them probably wouldn't /petition, of course) because they don't need to be thinking about that while they are in the game.  You are free to disagree, and you apparently were free, for a time, to have the name (which, as stated by at least one astute poster here, you do not *own* at all).  However, those who are bothered are also free to /petition your name if they choose to.<P>Further, you haven't addressed the idea brought up that you brought further attention on yourself by hunting in an area where there would be no real reason for you (meaning the actual character present) to hunt (i.e. "phat lew" or experience).  You *admitted* that the reason you were there was to twink another character.  While that is allowed by the rules and PnP, again you were likely to annoy people who were present because it was a place where they could do their *current* characters some good.  You may not have cared whether you were annoying other people (maybe you are one of those necromancers who consider it "roleplaying" when they are annoying others), but those who were annoyed did and decided to take some action.<P>I also love your decision in this latest post to insult everyone else who plays the game:<P>"Then again, why the bloody heck should I worry about role-playing anyway? This is no longer a role-playing game... I sorta discovered that shortly after my 3rd character. It's a means for some people to make money (E-bay) some sexually-frustrated little boys to release tension (d00ds and PvP during "after school" hours)and for alot of folks... a chance to have some 'cyber sex' with a high-elf enchantress."<P>Clearly, you know the best ways to win friends and influence people.  This perhaps explains why your first reaction to a GM coming to you is to go into /hostility mode.  "I mean, really, I don't bother people.  Just leave me the heck alone."  You bothered someone, or else a GM would not have shown up and talked to you in the first place (you apparently WERE /petitioned).<P>And you are "dabbing at tears as I read people tearing into -me- personally for choosing a name that I figure, people are going to remember and distingish me by. "???  Wow.  Knee-jerk hostility AND oversensitivity to other people's opinions???  Sounds like therapy is needed ASAP.  I guess it all depends on *how* you want to be remembered.  For me, you will be remembered as someone who can't tolerate anyone disagreeing with you, someone who doesn't care if you offend other people, and someone who thinks that everyone else who plays Everquest are "some sexually-frustrated little boys", people who want to make money (E-bay)" and people who want "a chance to have some 'cyber sex' with a high-elf enchantress."  This is a memory I won't carry with me long, because I don't sit and hold grudges against people whom I don't know, but it IS the memory I will have of you.<P>Good luck with relaxing a little, accepting setbacks and moving on with your life, both on and offline.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Now we're down to the idea that having morals is a *bad* thing?  MacRae, at least part of your point (using moralism in its negative form) might be correct.  It *is* wrong to try to force on others our sense of morality.  Therefore, it is wrong, for example, to harass an individual regarding their choice of name (whatever the basis, harassment is wrong).<P>However, this discussion isn't about players who are committing ANY acts *against* other players.  This is about people who are offended or irritated by a particular name, report it to Verant (GM/guide) and (usually) move on.  Just because you don't think that the name policy should exist in its present form does not make those who object to various names for whatever reasons zealots (I know you didn't use that word, but it seemed to be implied by your constant use of the word "moral" and its derivatives).  In order for them to (in my mind) be considered truly offensive, instead of, or in addition to, reporting the name to the GMs/guides they would have to proceedeto send /tells (/say, /ooc or /shout, whatever) to the person telling them what a horrible person they are, that they should be banned from EQ for being a jerk, calling names, etc.  This kind of activity would be ridiculous moralistic harassment and would be offensive (justifying a warning/suspension/ban whatever against themselves).<P>If the naming policy exists, then players have the right to cite that policy when reporting what they consider an offensive/inappropriate name to the GMs/guides.  Further, they have the right NOT to be hassled about doing so just because something that bothers them doesn't bother YOU.<P>I would welcome, and I doubt Verant would have a problem with, players leaving EQ to go to some other online roleplaying game if the reasons are that they can't have offensive names, can't kill newbies, or just generally contribute to a more hostile enviornment here on this game.  This small percentage of players are the ones who end up costing more money than they are worth, and are the ones who still do find ways to diminish the fun that others are having in the game.<P>Consider this:  A player who takes 15 minutes of one of Verant's GM's time with a name issue has cost +/- $2.00-3.00 to deal with.  Depending on how much they play (i.e. how much bandwidth they use), it is possible that in that 15-minute period they have likely cost Verant the profit from that player's monthly subscription fee; further, they have done so by attempting to violate the policy of the company and their game (not quite the same as someone who honestly experiences a bug and loses an item or zones and immediately falls into a pit of lava, etc.).  That's just the cost to Verant.  Now consider how long someone with a "real" problem (like those already mentioned) is going to have to wait because the GM/guide is being occupied by this *stupid* rulebreaker.<P>Having said all that, I'm sure that you can use the same argument to justify getting rid of the naming policy entirely.  However, the *environment* of this game is what we players pay Verant to maintain for us.  This is manifested in hardware by the servers, routers, Internet connections, etc. that Verant has to maintain to keep the game up.  It is also manifested by the actual software which produces the *experience* that we pay for.  Why should that experience be diluted for those of us who would prefer not to see names like "capnsweaty" or "ouchrugburn" or.........?  Verant has made what I consider to be a gutsy decision to *try* to make the experience as undiluted by the real world as they can (I think we all recognize the RL is always here and some if it will intrude in conversations while in the game) in what ways they can.<P>Could they have made a naming policy that would satisfy you?  Of course they could.  They could have simply banned trademarked/copyrighted names and profanity (misspelled or not), and been done with it.  This would have made the complaints of people like you (MacRae) go away (probably) when they DID enforce this less-strict policy.  However, they believe that the people who are going to stay the longest are, in the main, the type of people who try to immerse themselves as much as possible in the game, and thus have created their naming policy in furtherance of this goal.<P>All of that being said (whew, gotta quit with the long posts), I respect your right to question the policy in this and other fora, as well as your right to hold an opinion which doesn't match others.  However, categorizing people who agree with the policy and those who do things like /petition in favor of it as being moralistic in what seems to be an insulting fashion is NOT the issue.  The issue is the naming policy and how it is implemented.  After all, if the policy were different, the people doing the /petitioning would most likely not question names like "nuttinhoney."  They would know that there is nothing wrong with the name according to policy (or would be told so by a GM/guide) and would move on with their business.  They might still dislike the name for whatever reason (personally, not sure why, but the worlds of earth and Norrath have all kinds), but there would likely be no further discussion about it.<P>Good luck and Brell bless!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The following is copied/pasted from baby-names-meanings.com   Given names refers to first names. The problem I see is that people dont realize that the names we have in real life originated in ways that would violate the EQ naming policy. If such a naming policy existed in real life, most all of us would have to find a new name. If that isnt overly strict, I dont know what is. <P><BR>&lt;&lt;&lt;Most given names have "original" meanings, although modern users are seldom aware of them. Hubert comes from the early Germanic words hugu, "heart," and berhta, "bright"; Jerome is from the Greek Hieronymos, "sacred name"; Sarah is from the Hebrew word for "princess"; and Amy is from Old French amee, "beloved." Because names pass freely from one language to another, variants of the same name frequently exist in a number of languages. John (English), Ian (Scots), Evan (Welsh), Sean (Irish), Hans (German), Jean (French), Juan (Spanish), and Ivan (Russian) all are derivatives of the Hebrew Johanan. Modern names often are derived from sources such as the names of the months (June), precious stones (Ruby), popular contemporary personalities (Franklin Delano, Liza), flowers (Blossom), places (Georgia), or figures in classical legend (Diana, Jason). New names are frequently coined from variant spellings (JoEtta, Beverleigh, Randi). &gt;&gt;&gt;<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

"Unfounded assumption"?  I sat there, thought about WHY they would have the naming policy they do, and came up with what I believed was *reasonable* assumption.  If not, then why do *YOU* think that they banned phrases and such as names?  Because they're the meanies at Verant?  Because they WANT people to be angry at them?  Further, I talked about "immersion" as opposed to "roleplaying" in that assumption.  While talking about a sporting event from RL may not facilitate immersion, talking about someone stealing a pull would not take away from that immersion.  After all, if I were a hunter who was battling a bear in real life (silly to think about, I know), succeeded in fighting it to the point of its exhaustion, was then distracted by another bear somewhere else and had another hunter come along and take the bear with its pelt/skin, meat, etc. I would be *angry*.  This would seem to apply in the fantasy environment provided to us by EQ.<P>Further, why would Verant provide a special "roleplaying server"??  It is billed, at least, as a "roleplaying" game.  Now, whether people are meeting YOUR definition of roleplaying I suppose is debatable.  *I* try to be creative when I'm meeting people, and *I* try to "play" the "role" of my halfling warrior while I'm playing (and I've met plenty of others doing the same).  Do we sometimes drop into slang and talking about RL stuff?  Sure.  That doesn't change the fact that part of the reason we are in EQ is to roleplay.<P>YOUR assumptions include the idea that the people you have played the game with are representative of the whole of the player population.  This seems to be just as fallacious as you felt my assumption was.<P>Now, as to your statement about the "arbitrarily and randomly enforced" policy.  What exactly is arbitrary and random about it?  I understand that there have been *supposed* differences in opinion between GMs about particular names cited on this board (I say *supposed* because, although I have seen the logs from people having names denied, I haven't seen the logs from people having names approved).  In a couple of the cases I've seen, I have gone so far as to say that I, personally, would not have had a problem with some of the names that have apparently been changed.  Of course, that's just my opinion and Verant's opinion is the one that matters in the end.  I have also seen people gripe about the fact that they have seen X name and THAT one wasn't changed.  Of course, they don't seem to mention that they /petitioned the name with a GM on and gotten no response; nor have they said that "I saw X and X was still there two months later, even though I /petitioned."  These comments have come from people who often don't care or don't want to be bothered with /petitioning the offender.  The times I have /petitioned a name (after checking to see that there is at least one guide or GM around for it to be worthwhile), I have usually received a response within about 15 minutes.  The one time I *didn't* get a response, I did a /who all &lt;name&gt; on the person and they were gone (either left or the GM changed their name, making enforcement difficult to verify).<P>A lot of this seems to come down to "What are my rights in Everquest?"  My answer is that those rights are the ones Verant deigns to give you.  "Your in our world now" isn't just hyperbole or marketing; it's the facts.  If there was that huge a problem with the naming policy, it seems we would see more than one or two people every 2-3 weeks griping about it.  But, that's just more "unfounded assumption" on my part, I guess.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I can be swayed with a good argument.<P>But to say that I am misplaced because I am a moralistic person is a bad characterization.  Moralism is needed along with ethics in any society.  It defines what said society finds acceptable. <P>There will always be opposing viewpoints on any moral point.  That's what allows us to hone our moral to fit the present day society.<P>Therefore, to discuss things on a moral basis is a requirement if a society is to evolve.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>SkyFighter,<P>Paying money doesn't exempt people from rules.<P>Take the case of an amusement park.  I can go to Disneyland, pay my $41 to go in.  But if I go through a door that says "Cast Members Only" they *will* kick me out, and they won't be giving me a refund.  If I have an annual passport, it will be taken away (and I might get a partial refund, depending on how nice I am and what kind of passport it is... but my friends didn't in the case I know of).  In either case, it was my responsibility to follow the rules.<P>This is true of all kinds of places where you pay to get in.  Dance clubs, gyms, you name it.  The fact that you pay money does not in any way exempt you from following the rules, nor does it ensure your right to be a pain in the behind when you break them.<P>Try going to a club with a $10 cover charge where the policy is that you have to keep your shirt on.

</FONT><HR>Come on, Kas.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  I am perfectly willing to admit that it would be me, in real life, being offended, irritated and annoyed by someone's name.  I think we all recognize that people who play the game *exist* in real life, and therefore their feelings need to be taken into consideration at ANY time we are playing a game that forces social interaction (for most of us) like EQ.<P>Datathief was trying to indict the naming policy on the bsais that it would be horrible if it existed in real life.  That smelled like a troll to me, and I responded (mainly because once I'm involved in a discussion, I find it hard NOT to respond) as such.  It would be wrong of me to attack and kill someone in real life because they worshipped a "wrong" or "evil" god.  That doesn't mean that I shouldn't do so in Everquest, does it?<P>But you got me.  There ARE things in Everquest which can be related to real life.  Things like being polite, not spewing profanities in public (particularly when children are around) and not harassing others.<P>My contention is, and has been, that when people are allowed to have any name they want, the harassment quotient starts climbing and I am going to be made uncomfortable by some people's names (I can /ignore them so I don't have to read what they say, but when I do a /who or they are right in front of them they become difficult to ignore).<P>Do I agree with ALL of the policy?  Nope.  Do I agree with EVERY application of the policy by GMs?  Nope.  I've said both in the past, in what I hope are clear ways.  Of course, it's not MY policy to determine, it's Verant's.<P>Were I a GM, I probably would not have changed the name Tigergirl (despite the fact that I think it is borderline) but would have changed Piddlemaker (after offering a chance for the player to both argue the case and then think of another name when I said nay).  Another thread was regarding someone named Nuttinhoney.  I probably wouldn't have changed that one either.  If pressed by my supervisor in either case, I would have made my own case that neither name is questionable enough to justify the change, and further would have told him/her that he/she was going to have to change it.  Would this have gotten me fired?  Maybe (though I doubt it, because I'm a pretty good employee to whomever I work for), but it's important to do what you think is right in whatever your doing.  Unfortunately, not a lot of people feel that way about their jobs, and so will do what they're told to do (which is likely not to make any exceptions so as not to appear to be playing favorites).<P>My primary argument is that the naming policy is fundamentally sound, and there are good reasons to have it.  I remember back in the days of local BBS's (I loved the heyday when my city had the highest per-capita number of Commodore 64 bulletin board systems in the country), there were people who simply would not participate in otherwise good message boards simply because their policies regarding profanity, flaming and other questionable material was too loose.  Fortunately, when we used to run these boards we wouldn't charge anything and so were not losing any money based on these kinds of decisions (in some cases, we did lose people who would have been excellent contributors to our various discussions).  If I (or any of the other people running systems) would have been trying to make a profit, these decisions might have hurt me and I likely would have made stricter policies.  You can see similar decisions made in the movie industry when trying to change content in their films to bring a movie from an 'R' rating to a 'PG' or 'PG-13' rating.  There are many people who simply will not go to see an 'R' movie, so when a movie gets that rating those people will automatically not pay money to go see it.<P>Verant is trying to appeal to a broad cross-section of people with their game, and they seem to have succeeded.  They made decisions not to include blood while in battle, visible dismemberments from slashing weapons (yes, there are body parts that can be looted, but the actual dismemberment is not seen), etc.  They did this not because the technology wasn't there to do it (after all even Doom had blood, even if it was heavily pixelized), but because you will sell more games and get more subscribers if you don't have that kind of material.  Would *I* still play the game if it included some of these things?  Sure, because I'm not a person easily turned off by that kind of thing.  Would I still play if there was no naming policy?  Probably, though if it got too bad it could turn me off.  Just like most of you who *don't* like the naming policy are still playing.<P>(I don't know why I'm addicted to these discussions.  They're getting to be like Evercrack itself.)   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Babbster,<P>I believe they hve a naming policy, because they originally believed in the ideal that EQ would be a roleplaying game. I suppose many of us did. It didn't work out that way, just like communism never did. Because people are just people and will never live up to the ideal. Presumably they don't get rid of it because some people haven't acceded to the reality of the sitution, and also because it protects some people's delicate sensibilities.<P>Yes it is billed as a roleplaying game, much as EOB, the gold box games, Diablo, ad infinitum have been. To most people who have never PLAYED a real roleplaying game, the phrase "roleplaying game" means wizards and spells and levels and magic items. Not roleplaying. It's just the way it evolved. I'm not complaining. But it's the way it is.<P>Many roleplayers have asked for a server where they could in fact immerse themselves without distraction from the casual majority. But they don't.<P>My assumption *is* that I have representative experience of players, or else, if I don't, then no one does. I have been playing for as long as EQ has been around. I played UO before that, DSO before that, and Yserbius before that, and NWN before THAT if anyone even remembers NWN. So I can pretty much say that I know what these games are about. And too many non online "CRPG"s to mention.<P>It's not about roleplaying.<P>If you are lucky it is about making new friends and a certain form of compatrism, teamwork, and sharing victory and defeat. But roleplaying is not very much evident. And with rare exception it never was much even in the pnp world.<P>The naming "policy" IS randomly enforced. *I* have friends who have been beat about the head and neck with it. And other friends with more egregious names, never been bothered. This I call arbitrary and random. To you it may be merely anecdotal, but to me it is reality. And from the posts here my experience is not a stitistical spike.<P>As for the rights that "Verant deigns to give" us, just like with any business you deal with, it's a sad reality that frequently you have to make a stink to get what you want. But you CAN get it.<P>Also your analogy of killing someone for evil isn't appropriate. If you would IN GAME (or IC )remonstrate for having a silly name, I don't think anyone would care. Yes, "killing" somoeone for being "evil" (or whatever reason floats your boat) is perfectly valid. But the name policy is an out of game issue.<P>Basically I would find no fundamental fault with ANY naming policy that was fairly and uniformly enforced. Make it as restrictive as you want. I think it is delusional to think that a naming policy will make people behave differently, and more roleplayerlike, but if you think it might work, knock your lights out. But don't target Tigergirl, and then let Shlongusmaximus get by.<P>Netprophet,<P>Ethics are good, and morals may be needed. But moralism I would disagree about. Ethics are about your behavior. Moralism is about your desire to control other people's behavior.<P>Skyfighter,<P>Well put.

</FONT><HR>SkyFighter, I don't know how it is for you, but if I wanted something bad enough to shell out money for it, I do my best to understand what my part of the obligation is so that it's not taken away from me.<P>I do not believe that money should entitle people to treat people however they want to and tromp over others.  I get pissed off when it seems like everyone in a BMW thinks they have a god-given right to be in front of me.  When I've been in customer service, I haven't taken abusive crap from customers with big orders any more than from customers with small orders.  It is *no one's* right to treat other people that way or to break the rules and policies of an arena they share with others, no matter how much money they pay.<P>Besides, I could use your argument against you.  I pay my $9.89 / month.  The GMs should take away any stupid name I get tired of seeing, right?<P>Whose rights are more important, SkyFighter?  Which players?  The one who paid their $9.89 and wants to have a name that violates the stated polciy, or the 10 (if it is only that many... probably more) who would find the name annoying/offensive?<P>I don't care if Tigermaker Piddlegirl paid the GM $100, no one should be harangued like the GM was.  Insulting his manhood... that's what $10 gets you?  The right to do that?  And the worst the GM said was "Slander away."  <P>I know people who you can pay to be abused like that.  It costs way, way more than $9.89, and it's not legal.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"Ethics are good, and morals may be needed. But moralism I would disagree about. Ethics are about your behavior. Moralism is about your desire to control other people's behavior."<P>Macrae, actually your working definition of ethics and morals is not correct.  Ethics are about the right and wrongs within a profession.  Morals are about the right and wrongs within human interaction.<P>Case in point: A doctor has sex with a consenting patient.  Is this unethical?  Is this immoral?  I think it is safe to say the medical profession considers that wrong, therefore yes it is unethical.  The other question is a little more difficult because it depends on the morays of the society they belong to.  In a society that accepts sexual interaction between consenting adults then this act would not be immoral, unethical but not immoral.  In a society, such as some religious ones, that don't condone sexual interaction out of wedlock, then this is an immoral act within that society.  There are no absolutes when it comes to right and wrong.  Within a satanic society it is morally acceptable to kill.  Fortunately, those societies do not prevail upon the greater human race.<P>I do not believe in the context of this thread, ethics have any role.<P>So to call me moralistic, you are saying that I have a strong sense of right or wrong.  But that is not the characteristic you are expressing about me.<P>I think I understand what you are trying to say, which is that the delivery of an opinion can be put such that it appears that that is the only option.  I tend to put my opinions forth assuming that I am right (at the moment).  Who doesn't?  Do you express opinions that you know are wrong?  One only does that when one must be political.  I try not to be political and therefore put my opinions out as I think they are correct.<P>Okay, I will concede that it is more diplomatic if one would preface an opinion wiht: "I could be wrong, but &lt;insert strong opinion&gt;."  If that's your point then I concede to that.  I am not very diplomatic. <P>So, I am sure we are boring the entire thread with our personal interactions so if you don't agree, my friend, we will have to agree to disagree.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Either way, it wasnt a big deal to me but I never did know why it was in violation.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055559-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055559.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055559-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055559-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055559&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055559&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
