I will have little access to the Internet while I'm there, and I don't want to start a thread like this right before I leave. Also, for you Rogues reading, I'm moving you back to Tuesday next week, I won't be in the office on Monday.<BR>Monks are one of those interesting types of warrior that, as a class, we have tried to balance a rather large volume of damage dealing with a lesser type of armor. It's not an easy task to build a fighting class that is 'balanced' with a warrior but doesn't wear armor…<P>So tell me what you think needs to be changed about monks. Keep in mind that I am primarily looking for balance issues, but give me whatever you've got. I am also not looking for suggestions that would dramatically change the class, or that would require an army of people to get into the game. I'm mostly looking for tweaks that would help to balance the class.<P>Thanks.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>Posting up Zad/Bodi's post again cause its what the real dedicated monks need/want.<P>This post has been compiled from a very large thread from Zadkiel Hopeseeker's Monkly-Business website. The majority of this post was originally written by Kaiele Katarn&lt;, of the Innoruuk Server. <P>The main issue that Monks currently face is dealing damage in the end game. Prior to Kunark, and the changes in the melee skill caps, we were ahead of all other classes in dealing melee damage with the exception of a backstabbing rogue (which is as it should be). <P>Since our damage was based on our higher skill caps, and those skill caps were raised for all other melee classes with the Kunark expansion, the gap has closed dramatically. Damage dealing is the only potential a monk adds to a group, especially due to changes in the way the Feign Death skill works, and mobs' reactions to Feign Death. <P>Currently, a monk offers very little to a group due to the changes in damage. A warrior has higher hitpoints, higher AC, and higher magic resistance -- and thanks to the loss of a skill cap advantage for monks and new, extremely high ratio Velious and Kunark weapons for warriors, monks no longer have a clear advantage in dealing damage over a warrior. <P>Because the skill caps cannot be raised for monks to re-establish damage potential from that side due to programming issues, we would like to propose the following changes for the monk class.<P>DAMAGE INCREASE<P>1) Some type of upgrade to damage output.<BR>Rogues are incredibly powerful when they are behind a mob. Warriors are incredible tanks. Monk damage -- either with an "uber" staff or with epic fists -- should be halfway between a rogue's potential when the rogue is behind a mob using a Ragebringer and a warrior who is attacking with his/her best weapons. Keep in mind 10/16 and 13/20 weapons for warriors when rebalancing our damage. There are many ways to tune this damage, but PLEASE do not resort to another UBER-rare staff that will only balance the 1% of the monk population lucky enough to get one of these drops.<P>2) Raise fist damage post-50 for those without epics.<BR>While the delay continues to drop, the damage never increases once a monk hits level 50. Very few monks use fists anymore, but this would make the RP'ers and casual players a tad more viable near the end-game, if they ever get there. <P>3a) Encourage usage and training of lesser monk special attacks.<BR>Either allow us to use one type of strike and one type of kick at the same time by unhooking the special attack re-use timers post-50, or give the possibility of attack "strings". (This is the preferred solution, but would be harder to implement.) If a monk successfully uses Flying Kick on an enemy -- connects for damage -- then give a chance (based on Double Attack skill, preferably) for the monk to automatically use Dragon Punch/Tail Rake. If Dragon Punch/Tail Rake connects for damage, give a slightly lesser chance of doing an Eagle Strike. This is not only an interesting solution, it would make raising all of the monk special attack skills more important. This would be a post-50 enchancement, or when a monk reaches 200 skill in Flying Kick.<P>--- If this is technically not reasonable from a coding standpoint, then a secondary option would be: <P>3b) Minimum damage on Flying Kick.<BR>It won't make a huge difference in our damage output, but it will at least make us FEEL better. There is nothing worse than doing a flying kick for 3 damage as a post-50 monk. Even making this minimum damage cap post-50 only would be an improvement, and would not unbalance the pre-50 game where monks did have an advantage.<P>Damage Increase Suggestions:<P>To recap, a level 50's fist is a 14/30 weapon, which reduces (in delay only) to 14/26 at level 60. One suggestion is to have the damage increase (as it does for the rest of the levels) post 50 as well, so that a Monks fist at 60 is 16/26.<P>One of the best suggestions that has come from the many Monks is to have the main hand damage bonus applied to the off hand.<P>This is becasue Monks are the masters of Duel-Wield. We get it as a level 1 skill, and gain 7 points per level, capping faster and higher than any other class. This indicates a natural affinity for the monk to use his off-hand, a kind of natural/trained ambidexterity.<P>Allowing us to strike just as hard with the off-hand as the primary will solve the damage-dealing problem and bring us up to the correct damage level of being between warriors and rogues.<P>If this change is made, you will need to remove MNK as a class capable of using the moss-covered twig, a weapon changed to be off-hand only because of the large amount of damage it does when a damage bonus is applied.<P>Other suggestions on ways to increase damage include having a minimum damage of level/2 for special attacks such as Flying Kick, or add some kind of level damage bonus to the special attacks, but the off hand damage bonus is the most favoured solution.<P>4) Improve Feign Death.<BR>Leave it as it currently functions in all but two areas -- If the monk is not removed from the mob's haste list and does not get a "has fallen to the ground" message, give the monk an automatic "Evade"-type effect. In other words, allow a monk to sacrifice a couple of combat rounds to lower him- or herself on the hate list. This would DRAMATICALLY increase monk survival rates on uber-mobs, when we're causing intense aggro with epic fists or other high end weapons. It also provides a check to ensure that monk damage is not overly high, if Verant is still worried about that. Finally, since this is linked to a SKILL, it still has a chance to fail, just like a rogue's evade skill. Also, fix the "no failure message, but the mob just keeps beating on me after the eighteenth feign attempt in a row" problem that I and many other monks have encountered in the post-50 world, especially while grouped in Velious.<P>One possible suggestion was to have something like "%T has seen through your ruse" when a Mob attacks after a succesful feign, simalar to the fact that Rogues know when they have sneaked succesfully, and another for resisted Spells not breaking Feign.<P>5) Fix the Celestial Fist effect.<BR>Celestial Tranquility is a great effect on our epic, but it stacks with almost NOTHING. Most monks rarely solo post-50, and most common group buffs will keep the effect from working. (Call of Earth, enchanter haste spells, most bard songs, Speed of the Shissar, etc.) At least alter it so that even if the haste is not usable due to other, better buffs then the additional effects -- the extra +AC and +ATK -- will stack anyway, similar to the way the Robe of the Whistling Fists worked. It's pretty bad when a well-meaning ranger tosses me Call of Earth and costs me 54ATK and 12AC. The ranger buff especially does not make sense because Call of Earth is NOT a Haste Buff, and the Celestial Tranquility Effect will indeed stack with the upgrade, Strength of Earth.<P>Also the Celestial Fists wearers, felt that a graphic for the hands would be better than the hand wraps.<P>6) Increase Warrior, Paladin, and ShadowKnight taunting skills.<BR>Yes, I know this isn't an enhancement to MONKS, but it would DEFINITELY help us out. WE ARE NOT TANKS. Unfortunately, it's very hard to taunt off of us due to our extreme aggro, ESPECIALLY with our low-damage, low-delay epic fists. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE implement this one change if you don't make any other!!<P>7) At least consider spreading the weight limit increase out over the post-50 levels.<BR>Few monks will make 55. Even fewer will make 60. Therefore, weight increases at those two points are not terribly useful. A 2lb increase every other level (i.e., 52, 54, 56, etc) would result in a weight limit of 24 at 60. A 1lb increase every post-50 level would be another way to implement the changes, and would also result in a weight limit of 24 at level 60. If these are "too much" of a weight increase (the current max weight limit at 60 is 22lbs, from four-pound increases at 55 and 60) then skip levels 55 and 60, when we get our passive enhancements of +1 HP per tick while feigned.<P>The following are additional information gathered from other Monks posts, covering Skills, Disciplines, Armour and Quests.<P>SKILLS<P>Mend.<BR>Perhaps Mend at a skill of 201+ can have a small chance of curing disease/poison. The increase chance to cure will rise as the skill goes above 201+.<P>Skill Caps.<BR>Kick caps at 250. So why does Flying kick, eagle strike, and dragon punch all cap at 230?<P>Also, it was recently announced that they upped the caps for the Hand to Hand skill to equal 1hb/2hb, but all that was raised was the 60 cap, the 50 cap is still only 225 compared with 1hb/2hb cap of 240, so the 50 cap needs to be increased to 240 as well.<P>Higher Dodge, Riposte & Block.<BR>This is a concern for high level Monks in regards to the Big Game Hunts. <P>With higher skills in these areas, this would give Monks a unique way to tank better - Plate classes absorb damage with their higher hps, Rogues use stealth (evade) to not get hit, and monks just flat out use speed (block/dodge/riposte) to make the mob miss them. <P>Either increase the 3 skills from there current caps of 225/230 to 252, or have higher percentage chances of working (if that is not taken into consideration with a higher skill)<P>DISCIPLINES<P>Thunderkick<BR>This needs to be worked on, as currently it is being reported that 24 damage comes up the majority of the time. Possible suggestions include it becoming an innate or a timed discipline where every kick within the disciplines duration can be a thunderkick, {b} the minimum damage on TK to be 1 to 1.5 * level, (so a 60th level Monk will not kick for less than 60-90 damage with it), {c} add a short stun to Thunderkick, or {d} make TK a special attack after flying kick, gained at 50+th level or so.<P>These suggestions assume that the damage is not based from the FK damage table, and flying kick is not improved in any of the above afore mentioned ways.<P>We would like all the disciplines to receive an increase in length, and looking at the new hybrid disciplines, no one else has every discipline last for short periods of time.<P>ARMOUR<P>Monk armour needs some natural AC progression. It would be nice to see all cresent pieces (obtainable at around level 30) being 1 point more AC then cured silk (obtained at level 15) shiverback (obtained at 46+) being 1-2 AC greater than cresent, and Velious quest armour (obtained at level 50+) being 1-2 greater than shiverback. Each piece should have a higher AC than the same piece of the previous type. <P>Also, why does our equipment seem to have less (overall) in stats, resists, and clickable effects then other melee classes?<P>Leggings<BR>Cured - AC5<BR>Crescent - AC3 +stats +svs<BR>Shiver - AC5 +stats +svs<BR>Velious - AC6 +stats + svs +hp +Effect<BR>Black Panther - AC8 +stats<BR>Other - Gators AC 7 +stats, +hp<P>Arms<BR>Cured - AC4<BR>Crescent - AC3 +stats +hp <BR>Shiver - AC5 +stats<BR>Velious - AC7 +stats, svs, hps <BR>Black Panther - AC7 +stats, svs<BR>Other - Azures AC 12<P>Bracer<BR>Cured AC3<BR>Crescent - NONE<BR>Shiver - AC4 +stats, +svs <BR>Velious - AC6 +stats, +svs, +effect <BR>Black Panther AC6 +stats, +hp <BR>Other - Vox AC 7<P>Gloves<BR>Cured - AC4<BR>Crescent - AC3 +stats +svs<BR>Shiver - AC5 +stats, +effect, +svs<BR>Velious - AC10 +svs, +stats, +hps<BR>Black Panther - AC7 +stats <BR>Other - Treants AC 8 <P>This table refers to a selection of our armour, and the other column is what a normal 35th to 40th level Human Monk currently wears. As noted, these MONK ONLY pieces do not have any kind of progression AC wise, which ultimately is one of the main things ppl look for. <P>As shown, Crescent has a lower AC than Cured, Blank Panther armour, which is Tailored (admittedly at high skill) is mostly better than Velious armour. <P>If Shiverback AC was raised to the AC level of the Black Panther armour, and the Velious armour AC rasied to that beyond Black Panther, I think that the vast majority of Monks would be very pleased. You will NOT increase a Monks AC, only make Monks want to wear their own armour.<P>To clarify, NOT ONE MONK is asking for more AC on pieces than we are already wearing, simply the AC of Monk only armour to be brought in line. If Velious sleeves had an AC of 10, they would be worn by many Monks over the Azure Sleeves they have worn for the past 30+ levels.<P>MONK QUESTS<P>Treant Fists.<BR>Make them have a slight effect (whether attack raised by 1 to 10, a small self only heal or even an effect like summoning bandages), or alter the stats enough to make the Monks of that level want to do the (35hr average long) quest, rather than the all to easy Gem Inlaid Guantlets, which provides a very simalar quest result in a fraction of the time.<P>The Collar of Neshika.<BR>The Collar itself is to heavy, and the weight needs to be greatly reduced from 1.5, perhaps down to 0.2, and adding one AC, would make the quest worth completing (and wearing over a Undead Collar)<P>Iksar Quests<BR>I belive their final quest (whistling Fist?) is still unfinished, and needs to be looked into.<P>This post does not cover everything, and as mentioned is compiled from many to help you decide what we think is required. Monks upto level 50, we believe are balanced, and it really is the end game (50 to 60th) that things need to be addressed.<P>---<P>Posted on behalf of the monk community at www.monkly-business.com<P>Zadkiel Hopeseeker<P>reposted by<BR>Azith Evertoon<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I totally agree that monks need to be dealing more dmg.  As for as what I read that is what the monks are supposed to be, dmg dealers.  We don't get near the best ac... we have no spells... and our skills don't near make up for the lack of spells.  (good gosh u have seen the list of spells the casters get... including the rangers-shammys-druids)  <P>I also think back to why I decided to start a monk in the first place.  I didn't want to be just a warrior with the name of a monk.  In other words I didn't want to be searching throughout the game looking for the next big weapon or armor to make my self better.  I wanted my monk character to perfect his body as a weapon.  And as a newbie I thought this was possible... but as I get ever closer to uberdom with my monk.  I have come to realize that monks on this game are simply warriors with another name... with the ability to FD.  Come on, fix it so I can do dmg with my fists and feet..<P>This would be an easy code fix too... simply raise the hand to hand max for monks...<P>On a side note... I think Verrant would do better making each class it's own... Instead of focusing on makimg them balanced.  Balanced implies equal.  Equalness isn't need to make players want to choose classes...

</FONT><HR>Verant has graced monks with some terrific monk-only 2HB weapons.  Thank you.<P>But why, at upper levels, do we share 1HB weapons with other classes?  And why are warriors, in particular, getting superior 1H weapons?  Monks are supposed to outdamage warriors.  We get this advantage as a damage dealing class because of our low Hitpoints, and restricted armor selection.  But how are we supposed to outdamage a warrior who has better 1H weapons?<P>Warriors are supposed to have the best variety of weapons, not necessarily the best weapons.  The damage dealers (monks and rogues) actually are the ones who need the best possible weapons in a class.<P>It's a funny thing - one of the problems with the monk class is not a problem with the class at all - it is a problem with the equipment being made available to classes like the warrior.  Please review the balance of the melee classes in the context of weapons, and please make some better 1H weapons available to the monk class.  Oh, and if you really want to do something cool?  Continue the terrific idea you started with our CF - modify the attributes of our hands, rather than providing weapons.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Several suggestions some of which have already been discussed..<P>-Triple attack... how ever slight the chance the warriors triple goes off, this should have been a monk/ranger skill..<P>-Flying Kick + Stun OR at least knockback/interruption effect...<P>-Flying Kick + Min damage = LVL or lvl/2<P>-Eagle strike etc... Unhooking the punches vs kicks, make both able to attack on separate timers... possibly give the stun effect to the lesser damage attacks, to give tactical decisions for the situation...<P>-Reposte... Monks should be master of reposte, could also be used in lieu of triple attack, with maxed reposte a monk should be able to easily turn his/her opponents attacks on themselves thus increasing damage output and taunt, and minimizing any need for defence/AC upgrades...<P>-Disarm... Make disarm work on magic weapons by putting them on the mobs inventory, make disarmed mobs somewhat less offensive...<P>-Feign Death... Not sure what to do here, I love FD as both a defensive and offensive skill, either way your still at risk... just make it work somewhat consisently...<P>-Always duel wield/attack... If monks do need a damage boost, this is another alternative..<P>-Armor... Shiverback needs to have higher AC... really...  Pantherskin is lookin nice, but the weight on some of the pieces is too high, even high level monks would be leery of wearing this instead of using the weight for other purposes...<P>-I go for the theory that monks should AVOID most attacks, but be hit HARD, WHEN they are hit.. that means higher caps on block/dodge etc.. maybe add another defensive skill if you wish to keep them capped lower...<P>I think the overall monks are a great class, some things have watered down over time, and items added that go contrary to what a monk should be doing... a lean mean fighting machine that needs little in the way of items and equipment.. but it's too late to take back now.. how about some more stuff that can increase ATK or h2h and not help blunt ?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Monks are masters of hand to hand combat, and while traditionally trained in most weapon types, the training was designed not to learn how to use these weapons, but how to defend against them better. Monks are also well versed in dealing with multiple attackers, though admittedly avoidance is the preferred option. Evasion and smart tactics are just as important as a well placed blow.<P>1. I beleive monks deserve to have a chance for critical hits while using the hand to hand skill or their special attacks. This is to simulate their intimate knowledge of anatomy.<P>2. Monks should get riposte much earlier than any other class, and have the highest cap, to reflect their ability to take on multiple opponents.<P>3. Monks need another defensive skill, to simulate their innate ability to "roll with the blows".. possibly something called acrobatics.<P>Monks should be monks, not a weak version of warriors. While these above changes will not totally fix this, it will help, in my opinion.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I want to reemphasize the importance of fighting bare-handed to many of us.  The item dependence introduced with Kunark really has been a detriment to our class, one of the major reasons many of us chose to be monks was that freedom from need of item, and the whole idea of a character who WAS a weapon unto himself, rather than having to rely on sticks and batons to do his fighting.<P>I suggest an increase in hand to hand damage beyond 50. While delay thankfully continues to decrease, our maximum damage per hit is frozen at 50.  It's been said before, but perhaps increasing base damage to 15 at 53, 16 at 58, and 17 at 60.  Perhaps critical hits bare handed as well (seems to fit given that warriors get em with their broad spectrum of weapons, rogues with thrown, and effectively with piercing via backstab, and rangers with bow).<P>Additionally, in order to keep our interest in weapons, as something to add to our abilities rather than be necessities, consider bolstering the limited list of monk only weapons with creative procs.  Something to let us tailor our attacks to our foes, different procs to deal with different resist weaknesses, or special attacks/defenses.  Something to give us an incentive to use weapons, but not depend on them to be competitive with warriors.<P>I guess what I really want more than anything is to maintain my distinction from warriors.  And not in a negative/detrimental way (we already have that "distinction" with our vastly lesser HP, which makes us weaker tanks all around, and VASTLY VASTLY weaker in the face of casting mobs).  *shrugs*  Prior to Kunark, we had many distinctions..  Damage was one, attack style (unarmed) prior to kunark, and likewise, prior to kunark, defensive (skills/natural avoidance ability versus thick lairs of armor and HP).  Now monks damage output is extremely close to warriors, our "attack" style is like theirs (armed, and sadly enough, with the same weapons at the pinnacle, epic excluded.. jade maces =\), and our defensive distinction is essentially that we are at best equal (defensive skills), but more often worse (AC/HP).<P>Monks were an interesting/unique class.. restore our distinction please.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oh.. and I also support Bodi's suggestions, one caught my eye and worried me a bit though.  I strongly agree that the special attacks should ALL be useful throughout a monk's career, and I really like the idea of chaining them in combination - however, how this is implemented is very important to consider.<P>If it means having to slam an individual hotkey for each of them, it could get ugly, very ugly.  The current setup of gnashing one hotkey over and over and over and over is sort of skinner box type stuff, irritating and cramp inducing.. having to chain multiple keys (more than we're already doing with our other abilities) could get maddening.  Combining all the attacks on a single hotkey via a social would hardly solve the problem given the delay differences between refresh for attacks.  <P>I would suggest integrating these special attacks into our autoattack routine, not necessarily at the level we get them, nor at the level we get the next upgrade, but perhaps a few levels after that.  Hell, it'd look great visually, a martial artist throwing in all his tricks throughout the fight rather than the punch/punch/punch/punch...specialattack/punch/... now. <P>I'm sure there are other good alternatives as well =), that's just what comes to my limited mind.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

One that I think would be a big plus would be a damage bonus to our Flying Kick (2handed bonus) along with a chance of knock back. This would increase monk damage by about 5% as well as add the possibility of spell interuption.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've only played a monk to mid 30's so I may not have a whole lot of insight to the post 50 monk lifestyle but there are a few things I'd like to mention.  <P>First of all I've notice how similar monks and rangers are.  On all the threads I've seen both classes complaining that they need more defensive skills, whether it be higher caps or more skills to help out.  Personally I think monks' defense is fine.  After playing many different games with monks they all play the same role:  damage dealers.  In all those games the monk was terrible at taking damage but was great at dealing it, so please stop asking for more defense, it takes away from monks really need.  FD is your damage reduction.<P>Personally I'm offended that warriors got triple attack and monks didn't, who was the genious that decided warriors should attack more often and faster than a monk?  That makes no sense at all.  But really monks need to get triple attack, and need to get it before 60.  One big improvement would be have all of a monks special attacks cap at the maximum.  I don't see why a monk, who is the only class to get these attacks, wouldn't be the master at using them.  <P>I like the idea of having hand to hand be able to crit, you ever get hit by a martial artist?  They know where and how hard to hit any place on the body, it hurts.  <P>I could full of it on all of these thoughts, like I said I only played one up to mid 30's so be nice with your flames.  I want to stress again that monks and rangers are too similar when it comes to damage dealing and damage taking.  Both classes seem to say the same things at higher levels.  <P>My 2cp...please be gentle  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Some thoughts:<P>1)  Raise our H2H skill cap.  Yah, I know it's already high, but there's no reason it shouldn't be higher.  I really think that by level 45+, no monks should be wanting to use a weapon, unless it's something gotten from a dragon/god, or has a proc effect.  And even those weapons shouldn't be outdamaging, they should just add effects or stats.<P>2)  From what I can tell, all the other races seem to have an effective way of dealing with there inadequacies.  For instance.. The mages, who can't take damage or melee at all, have pets that do it for them.  The monk's greatest inadequacy is that it gets beat to death quite quickly.  I don't think the ratio of damage that we do to the damage we take is balanced.  While an argument that feign death keeps us from dying alot, the game isn't about keeping myself from dying.  It's about beating up monsters, hording equipment, and arguing about loot(lol).  If I have to feign in a fight cause I'm getting the tar beat of me, I'm not really helping anyone but myself, am I.<P>3) Increase a warriors Taunting abilities.  See #2.<P>4) More items for our level 19-30 brothers.  Having a Monk that's not twinked at these levels means you can't keep up with the group.  And by twinked I mean fighting batons.  I understand that your vision of Monks are light armor, but there's a different between light armor and uber rare armor.  Make the medeocre armor that we do get more available to the masses.<P>5) How about some proc's? Can you make weapons that are gloves that look at your fist damage, use your fist damage, and maybe do a proc every once in a while?  How about rings that have a proc then maybe?  Wonder twin powers, activate!  Form of, a monkey!<P>6) Monks should really get triple attack.  I also think that our punch skills (eagle strike and tiger claw) should not grey out our kicks when used, and vice versa.  <P>This one is a biggy, and I think every monk would agree.<P>************************************************<BR>7) Create a good monk guildmaster on kurnak. <BR>As a human monk, every time i've gotten a skill<BR>I've had to run all the way back to freeport (from kurnak which is where I spent most of my time now days).  Poor Iskar monk's only have 1 place to train... That's one of the downfalls of being Iskar though, and regen and nightvision and better stats offbalace that.  A temple outside of Firona V seems like a good idea to me.<BR>***********************************************<P>8) Change the Feign Death nerf from level 35 to level 45 or even 50.<P>and last..<P>9) If you can manage to stay under 15 pounds, i think we should get a natural running speed boost.  Can't tell me that a Monk wearing 14 pounds worth of equipment can't out run an Troll wearing 70 pounds worth of armor and carrying 80 pounds worth of itmes in there packs.  It would also facilitate with our job, which seems to be pulling mobs.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Tourmaline, if you think Raster is a bad camp.. you had better not try for the Treant Fists.  For this relatively unimpressive piece of leather armor, you will  find that you spend well over 100+ hours just camping the gorge Alchemist.  <P>Camps for monk quests have always been longer than most other rare spawns.. and unfortunately, monks have to camp more than the average number of rares for their quests.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ok having read the posts.... studied the discussions 2 things standout to me i am a lvl 38 monk and yes i love playing my monk, but certain disparities seem to be becoming more appparent as i progress lvls. the issue of ac vs dam vs weapons. monk specific weapons and armor available and what is require to get, by the time i attain a lvl sufficient to get these rare drop items the items are rarely up to the requirements needed to face the mobs that one has currently to as a result of this for example when i finally was able to acquire fighting batons i am better off just using straight fists ..... the problem w/ this is that it encourages twinking and so we see consistently lvl 10 monks running around w/ knuckle dusters something i can only dream and drool over ..... a similar problem exists w/ armor in reviewing the new velious armors most of the stuff ive managed to find stats on would be great .... for me at lvl 38 ... but for post 50?? i have stuff that ive wheeled and dealed for thats better, and the quests, unless you have alot of high lvl friends to give you support i cant even really reasonably start till lvl 42. my point is that by the time one is able to attain these items they are already out classed by the mobs we have to face alot of great suggestions have been made thru these posts for the post 50 game .... but please dont loose sight of the fact that since RoK and SoV that even the pre 50 game is hurting due to weight limitations available ac and weapons vs mob/lvl.<P>another thing i would like to question here its been asked (and you even started a thread on it) why do monks feel they are getting the shaft ... we even challanged you in asking what is verants vision for our class, and apparently even verant doesnt know, as so clearly illustrated by the prize items for last weekends convention, once again monks have been overlooked, the blade of gathering monks cant use because its a slashing weapon obviously, and the staff monks have just been completely excluded for use, not that any self respecting monk would be caught dead w/ one its too slow and the stats are completely useless for a monk...... hello?? anybody out there?? does anybody care??</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi again  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Just now to show my experience on "taunt" purpose :<BR>I've look at many of the post here and i was REALLY surprised !

That's all don't take my post in consideration 'cause it seems that i'm the only monk who "can't" taunt but it was just to make u aware of my personnal relationship with monster  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Btw just to make u not to forgot it : increase shiverback AC to become wearable !  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>Harigayti Disciple on Karana</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>looks like everything that needs to be said has been said...<P>problem is ABSOR hasnt really commented on the MAJOR ISSUE... damage output... with any knowledgeable answer... hopefully he has researched the dilemma and come to the same conclusion that 2000+ posters here have been saying all along...<P>monks need to do more damage, a SIGNIFICANT amount more damage<P>will this make the class more solo-able?... YES<BR>will this make the class overpowerful?... NO<P>please consider these things from a GROUPING PERSPECTIVE:<P>1- monks cannot taunt, therefore we will NEVER be main tanks due to the fact that casters and healers need a main taunter to survive multi-monster encounters<P>2- 9dmg 18dly weapons are common NOW... compare that to our EPIC FISTS 9dmg 16dly and you will see that our damage output is minimal compared to a similar level warrior... AND THAT IS WITH OUR EPIC WEAPON!... even if you are not a ratio-person a small child can see that 2dly does not give a measurable difference in damage... considering that warriors will have 50+ strength more which yields higher attack = more damage per attack... the difference is made up in many ways (i didnt even mention triple attack at lvl 60, or critical crippling blows, or enraged or beserker at low health... well now i just did ;-))<P>3- high end 13dmg 20dly weapons are now starting to show themselves... if you have any vision of the future... 6 months from now 60% of the warriors will have 13dmg 20dly weapons... sure monks can also use 13dmg 20dly weapons as well... but basically we will have the SAME RATIO WEAPONS... how the heck are we supposed to do more damage?<P>4- ABASHI has broken the classes down into 2 groups... MAIN TANK (warrior, paladin, sk) and SUPPORT TANK/DAMAGE DEALER (warrior, ranger, rogue, monk)... now consider the SUPPORT TANK classes in a grouping situation as the 2nd tank.... monks offer damage, rangers offer nearly the same damage as a monk + spells, warriors do the same damage as a monk and can TANK much better, rogues do 2x more damage than a monk from behind... can u see how each class offers MORE in the SUPPORT ROLE than a monk offers to a group?<P>its so painfully obvious i want to scream it in your ear man, but i guess i wont get an answer until you ask the TESTERS if monks were 'supposed' to do the most melee damage... please do that ASAP<P>then maybe we can continue on a more informed path of discussion<P>if for any reason you think that monks DO NOT need a damage upgrade... please explain in nauseating detail why and how we fit into a grouping situation at all levels</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
