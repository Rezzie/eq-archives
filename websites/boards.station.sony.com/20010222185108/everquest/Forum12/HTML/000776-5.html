Anyway, could anyone clarify on this (from the Necro thread):<P>"Fearless pets and or fear resist spell. This was given to mages. Umm shouldn't this be given to necro to improve their function in a group. Make it so they could cast on mages pets. Give mages the ability to summon weapons tor ways to make pets more effective. <P>Mages will always have the most functionality with their pets. But you’ll note that giving this spell to Necromancers is on my list."<P>Uhm. What exactly was givin to us? Did I miss something here? Fear resist spell? *looks confused*<P>You mages should all read the necro's thread, it's pretty funny =) It makes me all feel like playing my necro more then my mage. Hurm. I wonder why.<P>Give us our indentity!<P>Prophylon.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It sort of seems that nobody is actually listening to us.<P>Of the items on the "list" the main point we were making was NEVER addressed.<P>WE ARE USELESS TO A GROUP AFTER 50 EXCEPT FOR THE 6th MAN EP BONUS IF NOBODY ELSE IS AVAILABLE!<P>We cry for new summonings, we cry for SOMETHING, and what does he add from his list from before?  Fixing 2 of our already possesed (and mostly useless) summonings, and a reminder that we probly aren't gonna get any new summoned weapons.<P>So our pets will remain weaker than they were.  We will remain unable to nuke.  So hmm... need any bandages?<P>We ask for our pets to be affected like a group member.  We wanted some sort of mana regen (which other int casters get).  We wanted pets do deal some damage if we couldn't.  These weren't even ACKNOWLEDGED.<P>I guess what verant wants to say is "screw magicians".  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alan,<BR>This is the post you want to read<P>I'm sorry if I tend to disagree with you on this. The magician class needs as much if not more than any of the hybrid calsses that are getting a lot of attention. You think the majority of the issues are trivial. Well let me list the issues that are not trivial, and are indeed broken<P>I will write this keeping in mind the issues you are and are not aware of, and have prior knowledge of. I will also try not repeat the issues already addresses (lev 60 aegis of ro, lev 54 pet spell drops, etc)<P>I will refrain from naming Mage Epic a “class balance” issue, consistent with your other posts<P>EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ISSUES<P>1. Lev 52 and 58 Fire pets<P>Problem :<BR>I want you to understand the issue. These pets are supposed to be wiz casters. Currently they use wiz lev 16/20 spells. Which are very mediocre nukes, which get resistsed (since the pet levels are much lower than PC or mob levels during fights) and they dont even chain cast these mediocre nukes, they move in to melee. And they melee for only 28 dmg when comparable pets (earth, air, water) hit for 56-60. All in all it's damage output is pitiful, PLUS it has the least hitpoint. <P>Solution:<BR>Now that you understand the problem, I propose that you either raise the lev of spells cast by the pet to the wiz 24/29 spells and stop making it melee but just chain cast from a distance (it's a wiz after all), or remove the whole wiz concept, and give us the old fire pet back which casts a huge DS on itself and melees for as much damage as others despite it's low hp. <P>2. lev 44 and 55 DoTs<P>Problem :<BR>We dont hate the fact we got a DoT like you said. It's fine. It adds a little diversity. But it's useless right now. e.g. the 55 DoT compared to 57 DD. the DoT takes longer to cast, takes 30 sec to complete it's effect, has stacking issues, has a worse ratio that the instant hit DD, gets resisted more, has an all-or-nothing type effect, etc etc. <P>Solution:<BR>I think all classes with DoTs have to deal with stacking issues, the fact that the monster may move and reduce ratio and all-or-nothing type effect. That's the nature of DoTs. But other classes get excellent damage ratios. e.g. even the Enchanter Torment of Argil lev 56 DoT does 560 dmg for 150 mana with 2.5 sec cast time and debuffs int and wis and drains mana!!!! The damage ratio alone is superior to our lev 55 DoT does 800 dmg for 265 man for 7 sec cast time!! how pitiful. Why would I use this over my lev 57 DD, which does 825 dmg for 275 mana with 6 sec cast time and hits instantly!! Lets not even compare to the far superior dru/nec/shaman dots. We're not even better than Enc DoTs !! Please make this DoT do nearer to 1100 dmg or move mana cost down to 200 ish AND make cast time 3 sec or something to make it useful. It's worthless right now.<P>3. Mage DD mana ratios and resists<P>Problem:<BR>The mage DD and Bolts in the post 50 period received extremely pitiful upgrades. This was done to remove the magician from being second behind the Wizard in nuking power to third behind wizard and druids. Druids received far superior upgrades to their DDs. Did you ever wonder why no druid ever complains about their DD ratios. Plus Necro (lifetap) and Wiz ( Lures ) get far better opportunity to inflict damage in Epic encounter while all mage nukes are resisted. Don’t tell me that the mages do damage via their pets, so do the necros. <P>Solution:<BR>Please review the mage dmg/mana ratios for 50+ spells. Esp our bolts, which have an inherent flaw which makes them difficult to use (line of sight, z-axis variation) on top of which they don’t even have better ratio that the Druid DDs. I think the ideal solution would be to give the mages a crappy version of a Lure type spell at lev 59/60. Something with a poor mana ratio like 600 dmg for 300 mana or something, compare that with the Wizards Lure of Ice which is 825 dmg for 320 mana. There must be SOME appropriately nerfed version of a wizard lure spell that would be balanced in not pissing of the wizards, giving mage Epic encounter options, and basically adding to our arsenal in a balanced manner. Hence we might have poorer ratios than Druid DDs (and they get better heals now too) but we have added variety in our nukes. Believe me, some crappy version of a lure would make all parties happy. Just have to find the right ratio.<P>4. Anti – Summoned DD<P>Problem:<BR>Magicians receive a line of DD spells which we can use against summoned creatures only. Currently there are extremely few summoned-only mobs out there, as opposed to the hordes and hordes of undead creatures out there. It’s hard enough to find a mob to use it on, but then it has a dmg/mana ratio which is WORSE than our regular DDs which we can use on all mobs. Compare lev 56 Exile Summoned DD ( summoned creatures only ) 725 dmg 250 mana to lev 57 Shock of Swords (can use on all mobs) 825 dmg, 275 mana. Why would I ever use the summoned-only DD when my regular DD is better !! <P>Soultion:<BR>Please raise the dmg/mana ratios of the summoned-only DDs. Raise the lev 56 Exile Summoned’s dmg to like 900 for 250 mana to make it more balanced. Also add the “summoned” tag to more creatures if possible. <P>5. Rain Spells<P>Problem:<BR>You know all about it. The resist rates are ridiculous (try casting it) and it hits our pet. <P>Solution:<BR>Remove pet as being counted. This does not make them unbalanced. Keep in mind that we cant use these spells 90% of the time since it’s an AoE and will break mezzes. It’s very situational. Plus resist rates are incredibly high, please look into them, they need to be somewhat lowered.<P>IMPORTANT ISSUES<P>6. Lev 56 Dyzil’s Deafening Decoy<P>Problem:<BR>You know it. The pet is useless because the taunt is non-existant. There is no reason to use it.<P>Solution:<BR>I like your suggestions. Make the AoE Taunt REALLY grab everyone’s attention. Reduce casting time. <P>7. Lev 55 Rage of Zomm<P>Problem:<BR>I couldn’t care less what the pet looks like. I wouldn’t waste your time with such trivial issues. Right now the pet has 100 HP. Yes only 100 HP. You need to select a mob to cast the pet, since it will only attack that mob, and suicide after the mob is dead. Obviously the pet was never supposed to tank, but right now it will sometimes kill itself on the mob’s Damage Shield or will die on 1 riposte. Plus this pet has a 8 sec cast time, which you cast *during* battle, not before like the other pets. This cast time is a major hindrance. The pet is going to suicide after the mob dies anyway, why not give it a 2 sec cast time. Plus why does it have a 2 min re-cast. Is a 100 HP pet really that over-powering ??<P>Solution:<BR>Give the pet atleast 300 HP so it wont die on a single riposte. It still cant tank, 300 HP will get wiped out in one round of a mob’s damage. Plus give it a 2 sec cast time, and rather remove or significantly lower the unnecessary re-cast time. The pet has extremely limited uses as of now.<P>8. Pet mana costs<P>Problem:<BR>Mages used to be the masters of summoning cheap pets. All our pets were 200 mana from lev 20-50. This was out trademark as the other pet casting classes had increased costs. Post 50 our pets costs were increased to 400 mana while our pets were given minimal improvements. e.g. Take the max dmg by the best possible Air pet summoned at various levels. Lev 29 Air pet (28 max dmg), 34 air pet (34 dmg), 39 air pet (40 dmg), 44 air pet (48 dmg), 49 air pet (56 dmg), 53 air pet (56 dmg – Yes , same !!), 59 air pet (58 dmg). The pre-50 pets were 200 mana and gained new abilities every few rounds (dodge, kick, bash, parry, dual weild, regen etc) , post 50 went to 300 and 400 mana and gained no new abilities. <P>Solution:<BR>Either reduce costs on post 50 pets to 200 mana again., or give them better max dmg (I doubt this is acceptable) or , more appropriately, give them more skills. Give the Voceration pets lev 51-54 the riposte skill as well, and increase bash/kick skill caps. And give the Greater Voceration pets 57-60 either triple attack, or critical hits, or even higher skill caps on dodge, parry, kick, bash etc. Hence you would only minimally increase their power, but would justify the increased mana costs and the negligible increase in damage output <P>9. Pet Utility spells<P>Problem:<BR>Brainstorming better ways to make pets useful, and to really hone the idea that mages derive their power through their pets.<P>Solution:<BR>The valiant companion spell is an excellent addition. Making pets immune to fear is a wonderful idea and will increase our usefulness on Epic encounters. Would a pet-immune-charm spell also be considered. On the same lines. Also I like the idea of summoning my own pet back if not agroed, thanks. The new Expedience spell introduced on Test at lev 29 makes our lev 58 Velocity obsolete. How about a new spell at lev 58 which essentially acts like a war/rog/mon discipline. Giving us the ability to increase our pets damage potential (most of the damage done is melee dmg except for the broken fire pets) with some spell which last e.g. 3 min depending on the strength of the spell and has a 15 min re-cast time. This obviously has a downside since it will grey-out one of our slots for a long period to just use the spell, and then pets will after all be pets. They cant be used in all situations. Possible spells can be doubling all dmg, giving crit/crips, riposte attacks (useful for decoy pet when fixed) etc etc. Something useful at lev 58+ mages for special situations<P>10. Pet Heals<P>Problem:<BR>We get pet heal spells at lev 8 and 20 and then the line disappears. We can make a new pet for 200 mana. Why not give us better heals for our pets ? Why was this line abandoned ??<P>Solution:<BR>Let us CH our pets for the same cost of a new pet, you can even take the component. This has the upside that if we spent hours and hours summoning and re-summoning till we get our best pet out we don’t lose it. Also we don’t need to buff it all over again. <P>RELATIVELY MINOR ISSUES<P>11. Robe of Conjuration<P>Problem, Solution:<BR>As you know the robe has our lev 49 DS. Plus it has a huge casting time. The “mana-free” spell costs only 120 mana. Even the 56 DS costs only 155 mana. The necro robe has a 700 mana costing spell and the casting time doesn’t matter since the spell is cast during CR and hence downtime is irrelevant. It speeds CR since the necro doesn’t need to med. I think the best equivalent would be the lev 55 Call of the Hero. It will save us from the 500 mana cost and the casting time wouldn’t matter when the spell is cast outside of fights. But as of now the lev 49 DS effect is messed up since I can med up the 120 mana in the 30 sec cast time. So the whole point of mana free is irrelevant. <P>12. Phantom Armor<P>Problem:<BR>Two problems with this. Both simple and you are aware of them. Costs 4 cat’s eyes. Need a new component. And cleric can over-write with higher AC spell, but we want our HP regen. We cant even click off the cleric buff.<P>Solution:<BR>You know what to do =) Fix it<P>13. Pouch of Quellious<P>Problem:<BR>We get summoned throwing shuriken that only Monks and Rogues can use, not even us. Ok. !! So monks and rogues will come to mages and ask for it right ? no !! Monks now get armor that summons our LEV 55 pouch of quellious. This isn’t a spell that we can cast on 13 classes and 1 class got the ability to exclude us. But only 2 classes can use this, and monks get a armor to make it now !! <P>Solution:<BR>Make our version of shurikens better, so monks still come to us, or give monks our lev 20 throwing daggers spell, or less reluctantly, our lev 53 Bandoleer of Luclin, a lower version of our lev 55 Pouch of Quellious. <P>14. Improved Invisibity<P>Mages earned the right for this as much as any other caster.<P>That is all I can think about for now. There are probably other valid issues but I cant remember. I am not going to waste your time by asking for defensive spells (root, snare, fear), mana regen spells or other such outlandish suggestions. Most of these issues listed above are suggestions on corrections on abilities we already have. The only new spell ideas I think would be balancing are some pet buff at lev 58 + (suggested above) improved invis, maybe an upgrade to our lev 52 fire based DD (not mentioned above) , and maybe letting us manipulate (charm, fear, root, mez) summoned only creatures. There are few of them out there to make this work if balanced.<P>I hope you found my rather long post still concise, and enlightening you to the VITAL issues, hopefully from a perspective you had not received before. <P>If you can just answer to these points, I doubt any magician would feel their issues weren’t heard, regardless of whether you respond favorably or not. <P>Thanks for listening<P>Best regards<P>Desi Dhamaka of Omega<BR>59 magician of Quellious<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok - not sure this is the correct place to post this as it is not a "balance" issue, but more of a minor change that would make some mages happy.<P>Currently, the Epic pet has a pet name like any other pet.  I like that the pet is larger than other pets, but I think it would be nice if the Master of Elements had Master in his name.<P>Keep the pet name, just put Master in front, so instead of Gobener, you would have Master Gobener.  Could also do "Elemental Master Gobener" or "Gobener the Master of Elements." This would increase the prestige of the epic weapon/epic pet.  I know this wont matter to very many people, but it would mean a lot for those who went through the work of getting their epic.<P>Gypsum Bladesong<BR>Ranger of the 54th Season</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor-<BR>Your list is, well, lacking.<BR>The statement was that CotH allows players to bypass content they were never meant to bypass.  Then why in the heck did we get this spell in the first place?? This spell works only within the same zone, everyone knows that.  So when I'm in the crypt in Sebilis, and in a full group, and the tank has to go - now, provided there is another tank LFG in zone, we can send a gating caster back up to the top of the zone to invite the tank, and then I could call them both down.  Now this tank has (gasp) bypassed all this content he was never meant to bypass.  Since the person that went to invite him already fought their way down, they are just avoiding having to disband, find a new group, and fight their way down again to get back to their original group.  My point is this.  CotH isn't bypassing content, since the mage still has to get there - when you are talking about the zones 55+ players fight in, mages have zero chance of getting anywhere solo, so full groups are going down...CotH is used to replace players that have to leave. So, I'd like to suggest a compromise.  I don't think you'd be receptive to moving CotH down to 51, so how about introducing a 51 spell that doesn't affect hate lists that allows mages to summon a groupmember, but that person has something similar to a rez effect on them after being summoned?  Or perhaps allowing the mage to summon a group member they can target (by that I mean see - a shorter ranged version of CotH)  this type of spell would be far more useful than you might first think, and it would add at least some value to 51-54 mages.<P>Pet Graphics - I could really care less about what my pet looks like.  There are far more important issues that need to be looked at than what my earth pet looks like, or what its name is.<P>I noticed that pets casting dispels wasn't on your list.  Was there a reason, or am I supposed to never use fire pets or the epic pet when grouped with shamans, chanters and necros post 50?<P>Recently a player posted a summary of 4 hours of play on a raid in CoM, and the warrior did 30% more damage than any other class, and nearly double what a mage and his pet did.  I would be happy to produce more logs like this - to put it succinctly - I have to chain cast DD spells in order to have any measurable effect on most of the 45+ kunark mobs (forget Velious, there is no way even chain nuking I could do enough damage to make my class as useful as another tank instead of me) - keep in mind this includes the damage output of my pet.<P>On the list of zones that need better pathing - you need to include all dungeons.  I can't think of one where pathing is not a problem.  Pathing in Gorge King Xorbb is also totally horrid.<P>On the pets and AoE fear - the listed levels of these spells still means mages would be unable to use their pets on vox and nagafen.  Of course, they are still on test, so I'm sure thats subject to change/review.<P>What happened to mages being able to charm summoned creatures?  I can't see a reason why, unless you don't want mages to use their pets versus creatures that charm, either - which brings up another list of "big mobs" that mages are unwelcome because their pets can be charmed, and we can't charm them back.<P>I'm not going to talk about spell drops - I'd go off on a rant.<P>If Verant implemented everything on your list, it would still to very little to help the post 50 situation.  My guild has about 70 players.  I am the only mage post 50.  We had 1 leave to join an Uber guild, and 2 quit their mage.  There isn't anything on the proposed list to stop the trend of post 50 mages quitting to play a different class.  I go to the hole, and I see people taking druids over mages..druids are BETTER against summoned creatures than mages, and have a greater utility value.  Come to think of it, I can't think of a class that wouldn't provide a better overall value to a group.  Please, I'd like some logic that justifies this.<P>If not a thing was touched except the Linkdeath issue  for pre 50, there would be nothing at all wrong with mages balance.  Post 50, we simply do not do enough damage, pets included, to make us as/more desirable than just adding another melee class.  Our only redeeming feature post 50 is CotH.  Our item summons, including our most powerful summons, are obviously not considered class defining, or they wouldn't have been put on other classes' armor.  Correct me if I'm wrong here, but mages are pretty much all about damage.  Our primary purpose in life is to put out damage.  And yet a decently equipped warrior of the same level can do more damage than a mage, their best damage shield, and the pet combined.  So now we are a supplemental class.  I used to think that would be okay, until I saw our utility spells going to items, including our most powerful item summons.  It just isn't working.<P>Granted, I have heard other players saying "well I was with 2 mages, a ranger, a druid and an enchanter, and we did great in (insert zone name here).  The thing is, these groups are the type that sit in one place (usually in an outdoor zone) and pull the mobs to them.  They are not fighting their way into or out of places like Sebilis.  Are mages then ideal for the "EverCamp" style of play, not suited for adventurous travel?<P>Absor, I have a little exercise for you to hopefully better illustrate what the problem is for high level mages:<P>Take a group of the 3 core classes for high level game- warrior, cleric, enchanter.  Now, pick any other 3 classes and add them to that group.  Now, if you chose a mage, can you actually justify that choice over ANY other class?  The idea of class balance in my opinion is the strengths and weaknesses of any one class are no greater or worse than any other class.  If you did everything on your list, mages would still not be balanced in the post 50 game.<P>The list you provided isn't really a list of 'balance' issues so much as it is a list of fixes.  Even if they are fixed, it doesn't to a thing for balance.<P>Akherat Nahk'Silvermoon  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>About Pet control.<BR>Problem is that that are so low lvl and will have much bigger aggro range then pc have. We are fighting in raid and more mobs join the fight then almost always they jump on the pet. And the pet will shift taget. What can you do when that happen. /pet back off only work if someone stuns the mobbs. Or /pet get lost to kill the pet.<BR>Nothing else you can do.<BR>Pepole that tell you they have no problem with pet controll have never been at high lvl raid that involve more then one group. Becoure there don't know what they are talking about.<P>Solution<BR>Make pet at same lvl or have same aggro range as the caster. If you diden't aggro range are linear scale higher the lvl lower the range.<P><BR>Pathing problems.<BR>Thing to do. Make a limit how far the pet can go from caster before it kill him self.<BR>It's almost the same in ALL dungons. You move and tell pet guard me or follow me and u turn left and it's goes right on a detur around and pulls all the mobbs in the area. <P>Solution<BR>If it get follow me command the it shall follow. If it can't follow or come out of command range then it shall kill it self. To far from master can't follow. Not go all the way around.<P><BR>No defenfens spells.<BR>Ok I can buy that that we don't have any defences spells at all. But don't say our pet are defences spells. Do to pathing we can't move with pet's up.<BR>And Pet take 10 sec to take up.<BR>But that is no my point the point is we are offence class. So let us be that after the lvl 50 also.<BR>Mage are fine up to lvl 50.<BR>But after lvl 50 we don't get much upgrade at all.<BR>Pet at 49 and pet 50+ are almost the same. <BR>Pet spells are almost resisted every time and dmg output are the same. <BR>Our nuke do to low dmg and are resisted to much.<BR>A druid and necro out dmg us with out any problems.<BR>So if we don't have any defence skills so please let us have some offence power after lvl 50.<BR>Mage are made to do damage. And have to depend on others for defence.<BR>Please look at any server and do /who all magician 55 60.<BR>And you will see how few that plays mage after lvl 55 not many.  <P>Last Summons.<BR>Please give us useful summon they are no rent anyway and almost all our useful summons have been give away on items so we need new one to make mage useful again.<P>//Spellus Castus lvl 54 mage Innoruuk.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan Wrote:<BR>&gt;You’re kidding, right? It’s turned off there because of the way the zone works.&lt;<P>Actually turning on CotH in Sky would only be a Convience item, rather than a game play issue.  It would deal as saving time for the players and nothing more.  Another suggestion would be to modify CotH in sky to use a different component.  One that can only be purchased from island one.  Sky pearls that cost 150p each.  Mind you Alan that these are only suggestions.  I think sky is a wonderful zone, but doesn't get much attention other than epic's because it is so tedious and time consuming.  Turning CotH on in sky would make it a more used zone.  Just my thoughts.  Just make sure to take a look at the pathing there.  In my almost three years as a mage I havn't seen such bad pathing anywhere.  Hate is wonderful compared.  <P>Description: Elemental Maelstrom, Wrath of the Elements.<P>I also saw a post about our recent DOTs that we recieved.  I don't feel like searching for the post so I'll post a similar way of what was said.  The DOT was explained this way: <P>I blast you with the power of Water (DD), I hold you with the power of earth (root?,snare?), I knock you back with the power of Air (knockback), and I burn you with the power of Fire (DOT).  It explains why it is also a magic based DOT, because it uses all of the elements.<P>If this was why we got a dot, I think it's an absolutly fabulous idea.  It explains the mana/damage ratio, and short duration; however if that is the case it's not working correctly.  The Water and Fire aspects are working, but Earth and Air isn't.  Please check into this if you could =-D<P>And also, I know you had it on the list one time or another, please add voice graft to all pet using classes.<P><BR>Thanks for your time<P>Agla Magus Sator<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>   "What ever happened to the statement made about mage pets getting new 'dirty' fighting styles? As far as I know it never happened, but necro pets were shortly after seen to backstab for the first time..."<P>   Mage 50+ water pets backstab.  Of course, you have to arrange a situation where they can get behind the target.  That means circle kiting if you're solo; you'll never see a backstab in a "normal" standup mage-like fight, because the pet will be tanking in front.  It's easier for a necro, because they can fear kite, automatically putting their pet behind for the duration.  In a group, you can back off your pet, physically drag it behind the mob, then tell it to attack.  The pet is not smart enough to do that itself to take advantage of its backstab ability.<P>   Was the air pet supposed to be a monk, and get various kicks and things?  I don't quite recall, and I lack enthusiam to go look it up at the moment.  The 52 and 58 wizard (fire) pets are notorious, and their fighting ability certainly qualifies as a dirty trick on someone's part  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  And earth remains a warrior.  They get the various "dirty fighting" styles of their base class, which only really means "dirty" for the rogue (water) pet.  The phrase largely a bit of poetic marketing license, but there are differences in the post-50 pets.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Only two points:<P>-Lvl 52 fire pet:I dont know if the pet is less useful than any lvl 29 pet.However,it is definately less useful than the lvl 49 air/water/fire pets.There is simply no reason to use the fire pet.The 49 summons do more damage,tank much better if the necessity arises and their innate spells are more useful than the lvl 52s spells.<BR>Once you reach lvl 53,you will never again summon the fire pet,simply because its outdamaged and outtanked by the 53 air.There is no use for the pet,in no situation.Because it has NO strong points.<BR>Its about the same for the 58 fire pet,outdamage and outtanked by the 51,53 and 54 Vocerations.<P>-The lvl 54 water pet:Unlike other classes 54 spells,it is EXTREMELY rare.I am 54 and have most of the magician spells,including the lvl 60 water pet.I have spent months in Skyfire and never seen the spell.Other people report it drops of the named ones in SF,like Black Scar,Fairy of Dismay etc.<BR>This does not seem correct.It should drop like all other classes 54 spells with the same chance to get dropped.Right now the spell is far too rare.Please look into what drops this spell.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>With each additional response from Absor about the Magician Class, I move closer and closer to the delete and cancel button. It's apparent his original statement regarding 'balance' is still uppermost in his mind. This, in defiance of all we have said.<P>What we have here is a double standard. There are different rules applied to the other pure caster classes and even to other pet using classes. We're told we can't have more elemental DD spells because that's a bonus for playing a Wizard. Hmmm. Well now. Why are other classes given our summoning spells? Isn't this a bonus for playing the Mage and enduring the myriad penalties we get? Or, if not---what is?<P>That's a double standard or, pardon me, a bunch of bull.<P>Why can Necros cast spells turning themselves into skeletons. Isn't this part of the bonus for playing an Enchanter? Why can't Mages become elementals, then?<P>Why can Enchanters turn themselves into elementals (and thereby gain their abilities)? Elemental abilities are another bonus for playing a Magician. Why are they given out to another class in defiance of your statement, Absor?<P>Escape/Travel magick. Isn't this the domain of the Wizard and the Druid? Why, then, does the Necromancer get magick similar if not better? Yet, it has been given to the Necromancer--a pet using class--and we are told Mages don't get this because we have pets. What's your explanation for this blatant contradiciton of your statements?<P>My point is summarized with these questions:<P>What is the bonus Magicians get for their class to balance the myriad penalties? What's the upside to the downside? Why do you apply one rationale to Magicians, and another to every other casting class? And, why do you expect us to continue to endure it?<P>I tell you frankly that I will not continue to endure it. You've given me no reason to trust your judgement (and I am speaking to the LT here, Absor--not you specifically). The rationale you guys use to justify the penalties for Magicians doesn't 'hold water' as the saying goes. The post 50 spells (where I get to summon cake or beer or whatever other junk) was really the last straw when I first heard of them. But the final straw is the bunk responses we're getting to the class balance issues. So, fine. Do nothing then. Continue to ignore us and continue to believe we're too stupid to realize you have no intention of fixing any of the flaws with this class. *shrug* The competition is coming and I'll be going.<P>Alc</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Looked in the spdat and noticed something about our dots: they have knockback as the only magician spells. Since I don't have these (not a good sentence when asking for something) I can't tell whether this is knockback one per tick or just when it lands. If it's just once then I don't see the point and if even it really is per tick then I wonder why since mobs don't seem to have issues with walking and casting. Maybe changing it to a 0 sec. stun (spell interrupt) would at least give us one spell to interrupt casters since the only other we have is air pet. Of course landing a 5stun spell might cause all sort of fun aggro trouble but as the ratio stands (and with stacking issues) these spells don't deserve the spellgem.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What is bothering me the most about the Magician class right now is an item.  There is a Plane of Growth item for monks with infinite charges of Pouch of Quellios.  <P>First of all, no class should ever get another classes post 50 spells.  Especially if they are part of the defining aspect of that class (Magicians - summoning).  <P>Second, it's pathetic that giving a non casting class access to a level 55 spell means so little.  The spell is so weak that there really is no harm in giving it away, and it doesn't break the game by any means.<P>Gee, thanks.  I'm glad I'm playing a class with spells that are THAT weak.

</FONT><HR>Absor what about increased mana regen either for all casters post 50 or in the form of mana regen gear.<P>Also the pet no attack should let us add a 3 second time period where the pet wont fight back.<P>Its impossible to back of a pet of 45+ mobs without it being hit back and going ack into battle.<P>Also it would be nice if we get some new 1hs and 1hb weapons for our pets and ourselves.  The 1hs should have some 30-40dmg procs 1 sword for ice, fire, magic would rock.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Maybe build /pet follow me into /pet as you were and don't dare say you can do that with socials since I've tried and half the time follow doesn't execute or isn't heard by the pet and you have to have a considerable /pause between the two commands for it to even work half the time.<P>And reduce aggro for pets overall or make them follow player levels instead of monster levels so that they aren't attacked by stuff that doesn't dare touch me. It doesn't make sense anyway: monster will attack my pet but not me because it is low-level and after attacking my pet they will try to get to me because they know that I'm the pets controller. What happens to change their minds? Do the mobs think "Gee, I really don't like that guy but now that he has a pet I'll whoop his ass."? Sorry for the ranting but stupid things make me angry (lame sentence but I just deleted a lot of four letter words that didn't help).<P><BR>Oh and less robes more leather chestpieces post 50 so that at least the female mages can get in a group.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor i think you completely missed the point. <P>I see two things that mages (at high levels) have real problems with. We're damage dealers and nothing else, it's all we do and we're not even good at it.<P>1 - our nuking gets resisted too much, our nukes do not keep up post 50 in either damage or efficiency, therefore we cannot do much damage via nukes<P>2 - our pets are completely unuseable in far too many situations, with our gimped nukes and our pet up we can do alright, but there are way too many situations where we must rely solely on our gimped nukes.<P>you've shown no interest in doing anything to improve these 2 areas. the only possible exception is your soft commitment to fix every pathing bug (ya right, rofl)<P>many of the things you've posted are ridiculous<P>on pets: "There would be no danger to using them" <P>who said there has to be a danger, they are the majority of our class. I compare this to putting a proc of train (a spell that adds you name to the hatelist of the 8 nearest mobs) on every rogue weapon. <P>/ooc rogue lfg please, pretty please, aw c'mon<P>"your pets work pretty well as a method of escape."<P>it's a 10 second cast i doubt it, and it runs so slow i can't use one when traveling, my sow stays when i zone but my pet dies and loses sow if i even bother to get him one<P>"I hear from another one that says that they have enough control already, and that this can be done by a vigilant magician without such a command"<P>actually there are situations where it's impossible, particularly due to the fact you can only issue one commad to a pet every three seconds and pet back off does not stop them from casting spells they've already started. if you issue your pet back off command after a pet has started casting the pet will get hit back and will then start fighting again. you can then issue the pet back off again 3 seconds later but the cycle may continue if you're not lucky. <P>"Well, that 29 was the number you folks gave me. I’ll make it 49th"<P>i beleive the 39 fire pet will beat it in a duel, anyhow this is something you could have figured out in 5 minutes of testing sometime in the last 6 months since you started your infamous "list"<P>on the pet taking exp issue "Again, no. I guess I’ll add it, but I certainly wouldn’t expect it to change."<P>however in your own producer letter you stated:<P>"Class-based penalties are not appropriate. Classes are roughly equivalent in power throughout the level ranges, and the versatility does not make up for that penalty. In fact, the majority of changes made to classes in the name of balance in the last year were based on the assumption that, at the high end, each class should still be roughly as needed and balanced as any other."<P>you say they're not apropriate but you're firm on keeping it??? /boggle<P>on the plane of aky and CotH: "You’re kidding, right? It’s turned off there because of the way the zone works."<P>what? you mean the pain in the ass necro/cleric/duel tactic is the way you'd like to see this zone done? ever wonder why nobody goes there? give your head a shake<P>How the hell can there not even be a status on the 54 water pet problem, we were told it would be fixed many many months ago and here we are without even a status on the problem?<P>and pet names, pet graphics, pet summoning text... who cares? i thought this exercise was to balance the class not direct attention away to frivilous concerns?<P>summoned levitation rings, some people posted they would like an upgrade with more charges, or a longer lasting lev. instead you post a bug where the number of charges in incorrect. that's simply a bug, fix it and leave it out of the balance discussion. <P>shard of the core moved to range slot - it's already there you missed the whole point again<P>new procing weapons - "no action is expected on this item." of course not you only mentioned this to calm people down after another of many nerfs, it was nothing more than a spin tactic from the beginning<P>now you missed a lot of important things too. like the fact that the mage staffs you get off gods and top level encounters. could you make them 1hb and put some stats on it? is it too much to ask that when you get one of these incredibly difficult to aquire staffs that they be good enough that you'd actually equip them?<P>what about new summons? or do summons only belong on melee equipment?<P>what about mana regen? everyone else gets some form of it. maybe give us mana regen that only works if we don't have a pet up, therefore we can be moderately useful in situations that prohibit pets (again there's lots of these situations)<P>in summary:<P>the biggest problem with mages is the number of situations in which we can't use a pet. either change something to make our pets useable in all situations, or change something to make us useful without the pets. mages with their pet up are close enough to balanced, mages without their pet up are nowhere near balanced.<P>my one suggestion for this is to put pets on beta neutral faction so if they run off they don't get attacked, they just find their way back eventually</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
