</FONT><HR>Hrmm let's see:<P>I was in a group the other night with a 60 halfling<BR>warrior. We each had the same buffs on. I am a 55 shadowknight.<BR>My stats with the buffs: 2906hp 1001 ac.<BR>his stats with the buffs:4500hp 1200 ac.<BR>Yup, he has 5 levels on me but I hardly think I will get 1000hp<BR>in my next few levels. It's a difference of more than a <BR>couple ac and a few hp. Throw in signifigantly higher riposte,<BR>parry, dodge etc.. and of course a warrior is a MUCH better<BR>tank. All this change will do is make me survive perhaps a <BR>few seconds longer in a fight with aggro on me. I still won't <BR>avoid as many hits, my melee damage will still be laughable compared<BR>to a pure melee. Why on earth would you choose a hybrid over a warrior<BR>as the tank in a place like Sebilis? As an SK I do much better as a<BR>secondary tank. I can pull and I can taunt a mob off a caster fast.<BR>A hybrid is also good at breaking mez without chanter getting hit.<BR>Those are the things I have to offer to a group. I still won't be an<BR>effective main tank, I still won't do good damage output. But perhaps<BR>I will survive long enough on the commander to receive that complete<BR>heal. <P>I agree warrior taunt should be upgraded somehow. They are the best tanks,<BR>without question. Make taunt effective, raise the hard cap somehow or<BR>artifically raise it.

</FONT><HR>I dont ever want to hear one peep out of warriors. They went from a fairly weak and hardly played class to the most uber class in EQ. Tanks are cornerstone of all the damage dealt on 55+ mobs. They are so uber infact that if you look at all of the 55+ active players you will find an abundance of them now. <P>Example in pog last night. 5 warriors 1 paladins 2 SKs 2 rogues 3 clerics 1 chanter 1 bard 1 wiz. Mage robe and arms rotted and nec pants. This is an avarage night. Back in the day it was 1-2 warriors 1 melee hybr. 2 clerics 3 mages/necro 4 wizies 3 chanters.<P>People are quiting the casting classes to play melees, hell even i would like to play a 55+ melee because they ROCK.. so i dont want to hear any griping from the most buffed class in EQ over the last 2 xpacs. =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One absolute about any fight, the longer it goes on the more likely things are to go south and end in disaster. Face it, the changes to SK's and Pallys are not going to speed up battle, just let them hang in better than they do now. Rangers may do more damage (which they should) but with no better defense, they are going to require a Clerics almost constant attention to keep them alive in a big fight. All of this means a Warrior is still the best choice because he'll deal out max damage and require min healing. Give the poor hybrids a break. They had every reason to believe they should be superior to a warrior of similar level (why else pay the exp penalty) and the proposed changes being tried on Test just give them a little payback for all that extra work (of course any hybrids that went from 1 to 60 since the penalty was removed don't count [grin]).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Okies, <BR>First, let me state, I am a caster.  Yes, I have fighters, levels 1, 3 and 14 so this is primarily from a observers point of view.  <P>There is one thing that most hybrids I've seen can do better than any warrior.  What is it?   TAUNT!  Rangers are a great example. . . they die quick. . . why? Cause a tank can't out taunt.  Regardless of HOW the ranger taunts, a tank can't outtaunt it.  Tanks are great if they are taking the damage but if they can't keep monsters off the hybrids well . . . then their extra AC, HPs and such aren't really that great are they?  <BR>I must admit.  I love having a hybrid in my group.  It insures that I don't get hit too badly.  (I play an enchanter.)  Why? I cast a spell then the hybrid throws in a spell.  Combine the spell with the fact that a hybrid can taunt and do some really nice damage well . . . it can out taunt me (unless I were really trying to out taunt and then I doubt anyone could outtaunt me LoL).  Yes, warriors are great.  But I like having a tank that can go invis (undead or not), that can keep mobs taunted off of me, and that can dish out a lot of damage.  The fact that rangers and pallies can heal themselves is a great bonus if the cleric is LoM.  Shadow knights get too many and they can FD which is great because monks have to be invis'd to go searching for pulls unseen.  <BR>My comments are not for or against the changes really.  I just think warriors have some valid points.  I think that warriors should get something to fix that taunt though.  <P>BTW, I assume some of you are going to reply that a hybrid wouldn't try to cast or anything to taunt in a group with a warrior.  I beg to differ with any who would say this.  If the cleric or the enchanter are getting beat on, would you not jump in and do some taunting to save them?  After all, these are two classes who keep people alive (esp if you're a tank, 5 mobs, no evac if the enchanter goes down the tanks can only run out while the casters gate). <P>Anyways, just thought I'd pitch in my two cents. <BR>*drops her two copper pennies in the "Melee'rs-R-Us" piggy bank and scampers back to the enchanter boards"<P>-Obzidian Valdroth-</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Shadu1,<P>No offense bud, but your falling into the same 'well what about me' syndrome as everyone else, and not considering everyone as a whole.<P>Picture it, you go on a raid against Trakanon, along with you come warriors, rangers, sk's, bards, and rogues.  Now with the way you want it, you'll be dealing less damage, just because you don't want to feel 'obsolete'.  Now imagine during your trak raid that you all get ganked, with trak at about 15%.  Could that extra 15% damage been dealt if the hybrids along with you had had higher defense caps so they wouldn't die quite so quickly, or higher offensive caps to deal damage faster?  Less mana used for healing, and more damage dealt ... but no, this isn't a team effort, it's more about what warriors want, rather than the team as a whole ... just live with it bud.  SK's and Pally's won't outdamage you ever, and their the only ones close to being able to tank like you.  Bards just want higher defense so they don't die so fast, we have AC halfway between that of your average enchanter and a decently equipped warrior, and hitpoints roughly on par with a ranger, with defense skills (before the updates on test) roughly equal to that of a ranger.  And rangers, well, they'll die fast, the poor guys, because their already a high damage dealing class, and can't take the hits you can.<P>It would require 1 paladin or shadow knight and 1 ranger to equal a warrior (roughly speaking) for damage dealt and taken, provided the pally/sk can keep the enemies attention while the ranger deals that damage.  (except the hitpoints, but the ranger will go down rather fast once the pally is out of the equation).<P>-Desbarolis -- 47th bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Warrior.<P>Imagine taking on Trakanon when you are lvl 50.  Imagine yourself at about 2/3 health when you did it.  Now imagine that no matter what you do, with each swing Trakanon pays attention entirely on you and none of the high level people with you can get him off you.  Now imagine you were doing this all in the absolutely best armor you could get, banded with a few crafted pieces.  Now imagine you actually could cast a spell on him for 100pts of damage which will be sure he wants you dead.  And finally, your group tells you to be sure to snare him before you die.<P>Welcome, you now have a ranger.  And, just for all this, you have SoW to let you run back to your corpse.  By the way, the guy next to you suffered none of this and just paid a few pp to get SoW.<P>Now imagine you had to do this for an entire year, while people joked about your existence as completely pitiful and shunned you 3 out of the  nights you got to play.<P>Please keep this in mind as it was every day of our gaming life for over a year.  Please look at the items you have to do what you do, melee, and realize that no other class gets to see a fraction of their capability for nearly their entire existence.<P>I hear warriors competing on how well they tank Trakanon or Wuoshi, and then read a letter like this, about you losing your edge, and I have to wonder.<P>Hopefully you will read this and wonder too.<P>Anemone<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hail and well met...<P>I wish to comment on the D&D 3rd edition rules concerning Wizards and Sorcerers wearing armor.  First and foremost they can wear certain types of armor, leather studded leather, scale, and chain, but at a cost.  They better the armor they wear, the chance of failure to cast a spell increases.  For instance, Mr wizard wants better protection and buys some Padded armor(Cloth basically) he takes a 5% chance of spell failure.  So every time he casts a spell he has the chance of failure.  Every piece of armor he can wear will have drawbacks...Wizard wants to wear plate...fine but with a 50+% chance of failure.  I doubt he'll be wearing it long.<P>Just a tip from your Uncle Dunkhan.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>For the lvl 55 SK who quoted hps:<P>Do you remember what buffs you had?  The difference you quote seems highly unlikely to me.<P>I play a lvl 59 DE warrior, without about 2800 hps equipped and unbuffed.  I don't know how well equipped your halfling warrior friend was, but I hit my 2800 using epic, +65 hp rings, Beserker's bp, etc.  I imagine your halfling friend has around 2800 unbuffed also, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and say 3k.<P>So we have lvl 60 halfling warrior:  3k hps<BR>You said fully buffed he had 4500.<BR>That means he'd have 1500 hps in buffs<P>You said you had the same buffs, and only had 2800 hps.<P>2800 - 1500 in buffs = 1300<P>So unbuffed, yet equipped you're a lvl 55 SK with only 1300 hps?

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Please correct me if I'm wrong...  It sounds like what you are proposing to do is to balance hybrids with the current state of the classes and then to improve the classes that we are based on to compensate them.  Won't this put things back out of balance?<P>AS AN EXAMPLE...<BR>I think only thing that us hybrids want is to be wanted.  What does raising our defense cap do if you also raise the ability of the warrior to taunt?  I think the number one reason for a hybrid to be put in a group is our taunting ability.  Our new defense cap won't even be used, since the warrior will still be prefered in a group and now he'll be prefered for our specialty too (if one of the changes to warriors in taunting, which it sounds like it is).<P>I really don't mean this to be flamish, but if warriors can out tank, taunt and damage us what will we be wanted for?  I've heard plenty of warriors claim that LoH is a reason to have us in a group.  So, I'm only supposed to be useful once every 72 minutes?  Or what about my healing skills?  It takes me a whole bar of mana to heal two bubbles of a level 45 warrior.  All of my buffs are over written by clerics, shamen AND druids.<P>Where can a hybrid be useful if you buff warriors again?  I must admit, I want to be choosen over a warrior for a group position SOMETIMES.  Why should a warrior ALWAYS be the prefered/needed class in every situation?  Why should I always be asked if I have a warrior in the group when I try to recruit members for a pickup group and if I don't no one will join me?<P>I don't want to be more "uber" than a warrior.  I just want to be on equal footing.  I want to walk into a zone and do my shout out that I'm LFG at the same time as similar level warrior and have the group CONSIDER inviting me.<P>I guess this is just my plea give us a reason to be in a group and then to not take it away by giving just another new reason for players to ignore hybrids.<P>NOTE TO WARRIORS<BR>I love warriors.  Some of my best friends are warriors.  My brother is a level 42 warrior.  I don't want any power or abilities taken away from warriors.  I don't want to be "better" than a warrior.  I just want to be better than a warrior in SOME situations, just like a warrior should be better than a paladin in SOME situations.  The way that it stands, the warrior is a better choice in MOST if not ALL situations.  The raise in the defense cap will just make our taunting abilities useful to a group.  Giving a warrior the ability to out taunt a paladin will just take that away again.<P>It hardly seems fair that my brother who is 5 levels lower than me can out damage me, has more ac and hp than me and is chosen in a group before me.  Yes, my buffs pur me above him, but in a group I or a cleric/druid/shaman cast those same or better buffs on him.<P>I had an interesting conversation with my brother the other morning (we commute together).  He told me that he had never been in a group that said that they needed a warrior before they could hunt in a particular zone.  I told him "of course, YOU were the warrior."  <P>I, respectfully, think that warriors have no idea how needed a warrior is in a group.  It's like killing a mob when your group is medding.  You think you soloed the mob and go back to kill it someday without a group, only to get your butt kicked.  We've all been there.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>ONE LAST NOTE...<BR>Paladins would be more useful if we had more AC/HP buffs that stacked with cleric, druid and shaman buffs.  We should also get the entire yaulp line.  It only makes sense...<P>Logancreed Fides<BR>47 Paladin<BR>Officer, the Thunderwalkers<BR>Morell-Thule<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor -<P>To be clearer, my comment was a result of the changes _and_ of the comments you made in the warrior thread. The most recurring comment there was that taunt's ineffectiveness post-50 was putting warriors in a position where they were unable to do the tanking for which they were designed. The only related comment you made was in reference to the AE taunt someone requested. That gives the impression that our concern was dismissed (may not be the reality, but dealing with the public, I'm sure you're aware of how important perception can be).<P>I didn't expect these were the "final changes". I still am concerned that it seems that with all the other complaints, flames, off-the-wall requests, etc. it seems like the real issues are being lost in the shuffle.<P>Context: I'm a mature, professional male (36 years old). I happen to agree with you that I don't feel warriors need major changes. I'm not even particularly concerned about the hybrid changes, which benefit them and don't really harm anyone else. After 22 months playing EQ, I try to present a more or less objective opinion.  <P>It might have been better to ask the questions: "In what circumstances is class X ineffective/less effective and why? In what circumstances is class X too effective and why?"<P>Asking instead what we need to be "balanced" is like going to the car dealer who advertises a fixed price and then asks you to pick the features you want. Everyone is going to check off all the nice stuff  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">.<P>Going with the alternative approach, we can quickly hit a few points.<BR>- Rangers: Nice offense, but hard to deal damage when you're dead. With no evasion and with a lot of good, low-delay weapons, many rangers taunt themselves to death and their spells only exacerbate the problem. There's a reason a bunch of us have a collection of screenshots of a dead Jaraxel (ranger friend) and while it started out as a joke, it's pretty frustrating for other rangers (at least two of whom I know feel at a loss to figure out how to deal their damage and not die in the process -- both are pre-55 so no Jolt is available).<BR>- SKs/Paladins: in high-end encounters, due to the lack of the Defensive discipline and the insane mob damage, can't play the role of "tank", but instead are relegated to secondary roles.<BR>- Warriors: have trouble keeping mobs on them so they can fulfill their role of damage sponge.<P>I do appreciate that you're looking to try to find and fix the imbalances, but at the moment, there's a lot of concern that you don't see the problems amid the forest of whines/feature requests/etc.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

At 49 - 53 we are pretty much in our prime.. MANY of the changes i'm seeing will do nothing but unbalance shadowknights in experience oriented groups at high levels.  We already bring wanted skills to the table in these groups and some of these changes would make us much more desirable than warriors.. On the other hand, they do NOTHING to restore balance in the area of primary concern.. our current 3 second operational lifespan in top level raid situations.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My view of warriors and hybrids:<P>All this talk seems to center on a warrior and a Palangerknight (I love making up new words) competing for a spot in a group.  I look at it differently.  In most high level groups you really need two melee classes.  I'm a warrior, my hunting partner is a cleric and when I group for experience the group is not planned by class, it evolves with what friends are online, what friends are busy, etc.  There are a few exceptions for certain zones, such as Howling Stones where an evaccer and a chanter is required, or a rogue to open doors, but for the most part we have fun with whoever we end up with.<P>This makes for some interesting groups and adds challenge to otherwise boring xp hunts.  Ever stopped a Chardok train of 7 with only necro mezzes and Paly parking for crowd control?  Man, that was fun.  My group last night was warrior, cleric, monk, shaman, shaman, shaman.  It just happened.  We changed some tactics, talked it out, and the hunt went very very well.  I'm never going to tell a Palangerknight not to join us because we were hoping for a Warrior.  Well, maybe if I didn't like the guy and wanted to piss him off, but that's not the point  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  What I'm getting at is simple.  The funnest xp groups I've been in have not been traditionally balanced groups.  Had a group of low 40's once kill the Ishva: Warrior, wizard, necro, necro, necro, necro.  It was hysterical, but we did the job.  If you're always looking out for the 'perfectly balanced' group then you're wasting time you could be using to have fun.  And balanced groups are so boring!  Pull, kill, pull, kill, rinse repeat.  99.999999999 percent of most peoples' combat time is spent in xp groups.  Why get into a grind?  Not only do unbalanced groups make for fun hunts, but they make you think.  They make you learn new tactics, and more importantly they force you to discuss and learn more about other classes.  Or your own classes, even.  One shaman in a group knows his role.  Add a second shaman and both of them get to learn new tactics and how to work together to help the group.  In the hunt I mentioned above, the shamans were parking attendants, and damn good ones.  I could pull four sarnaks, and have no worries about our ability to win the fight.  With no mezzes or charms.  Everybody had fun.<P>Palangerknights have a very undefined, yet resourceful role in the groups I'm used to, and it really comes into play when we have multiple mobs.  <P>Paladins make the best parking attendants I've ever seen.   Why?  Because they can take some hits while doing so.  They can take their time, park the mob right where it needs to be, and come back to the main fight.  They also rock hardcore interrupting mob Gates.  Could have used their stuns last night...  They can patch heal a bit too, especially the cleric if she's under attack. <P>Shadowknights get a lot of respect from me.  I can't outtaunt them, really.  In my mind, they shine best when the group gets ambushed.  I stay on the main target, as the main tank, and the SK is quick to pull the new mob off the cleric or caster, and solo tank it while we kill the first mob.  Yes, he tanks very very well.  This is especially seen in PoG, where many mobs are unmezzable.  On our raids there, I'm main assist and our favorite SK is main split.  When we get two unmezzable mobs, me and the whole guild work on one, while the sk singlehandedly holds the other until we've killed the first.  (Ok, often times a dern rogue backstabs the hell out of his mob while he's tanking it, silly ksing rogues!)  This system works very very well.  In PoG, the extra mobs always make a beeline for the clerics.  A warrior just can't taunt them off as fast as a shadowknight can.  In regular xp groups, the sk does a similar job.  Melees with me (and yes, he does good dmg) and taunts extras off casters.  We could have used some of his darkness snares last night too...<P>Rangers:  Ok, Rangers need work, I'll admit.  In xp groups, they're very well suited, acting similar to the shadowknights with their snares and taunts.  But I have even more trouble taunting off them then I do the sk.  Has a lot to do with warrior vs ranger epic weapons, but that's a different thread altogether.  I love having a ranger pull, I think that is their strong point.  Sure, I have more hps and AC, I can take more hits on the way in, but what's the point when a ranger can snare pull and not take a hit at all?  This does cause a taunting problem, but it's a matter of talking the ranger into not attacking the mob in camp until I'll pulled it off him.  Tracking is huge in quest related groups, also, I don't think anyone can deny that.  But Rangers do have issues on large raids, I'm not sure what the solution is, really.  <P>The more I think about the test changes, the less they bother me.  I don't understand the bard's defense though, but I'm not going to go there right now.  As long as there is a clear distinction between who is the main tank, and who is a secondary tank plus utility, then I'm happy.  This test upgrade closes the gap some, but not enough to significantly change the status.  And if you're grouped with Palangerknights, it benefits you as well.  I'm just hoping some of the warrior concerns get addressed as well.<P>Wow, this post got long.

</FONT><HR>Pure Evil,<BR>     We do pay for our spells.  I can't take a hit to, quite literally, save my life as a level 55 Ranger.  My Paladin and SKs friends do pretty pitiful melee damage.<BR>     If you do not think that damage output is important then you have obviously never played the high level game.  Alot of mobs are incredibly magic resistant.  Wizards are pretty much the only ones who land nukes (even they have problems at times on some mobs) and so you need to have high damage tanks landing hits and doing damage.<BR>     A Ranger doing equal or more damage than a warrior through melee ability is never going to be able to hold off a mob as long as a warrior can because of the hitpoint, AC, and defensive skills differences.  Paladins and SKs are never going to be desired as a damage dealer against the high level mobs.<BR>     Warriors have both sides going for them.

</FONT><HR>Ok I'm a little confused. Rangers dish out tons of dmg cause of duel wield/double attack and wear chain based armor.  So why are they duel wielding the fastest weapons possible in certain situations.  Wouldn't a 2hander or more dmg slower delay one handers benefit you and the group better?  You have the same make up as a rogue pretty much in terms of gear and duel wield/double attack so why not use less taunt factor weapons.  Just like when warriors ask the rogues to not use their proc weapons in the off hand couldn't rangers do the same?  Not sure if this helps but i think it will keep rangers alive longer and rangers will still be able to dish out dmg enough to be a factor....sure they don't get evade but with well timed taunts from warriors rangers can lose agro...as for the hybrid issue in general i was kinda annoyed at first but then realized this will help them and still leave warriors as great tanks...now the only thing to address is some fix on taunt...i'm only 43 but still have hard times taunting off rogues/monks...could be my gear vs. theirs but i hate watching the rogue get pummeled while i press taunt 3-6 times with no effect =(<P>Laitha 51 druid of Rallos Zek<BR>Hyoree 43 warrior of Tholuxe Paells</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Coffinn-you just hit a nail on the head as far as SK's go.<BR> <BR>We're incredible taunters,and can take hits for a while distracting a mob. That's SK crowd control-keeping a mob from being so singleminded it drops the main tank. Or keeping secondary adds off the wrong targets.<BR> <BR>What we'd like to do is continue to do so 54+. With weaker defensive skills and no discipline that allows us to survive distracting said ubermobs,we have a raid lifespan of about three seconds. We don't need uberoffense to do it,obviously-though being a shield class(and we are) having bash up to full would be a blessing for most SK's. That way,we can do our job without stomping all over the warriors to do so,and can team up with a ranger to compensate if there's no warrior around.<BR> <BR>It's all about making more group options viable,especially at the highest levels.<P> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>If anyone is still reading this, I'd like to create a thought on the taunting ability of all classes.  I currently play a Warrior on Vazaelle and I can't think of how many times an SK out-taunts me while fighting side to side each other in our group.  Now, to make things balancing, here is a suggestion.  Warriors and Rangers share the same offensive power, but rangers get their line of spells.  SK's and Paladins share the same defensive power of Warriors, but each have their own unique abilities and spells.  Warriors, Sk's, and Paladins share the same taunt ability, but what really should be the case is that a Warrior should be able to taunt better due to their maximum offensive AND defensive capabilities.  Also due to the fact that Warriors do not get any line of spell craft as the other classes, I see reason to believe that their taunt ability should be more effective then that of the other classes.  In other words, if a Warrior and SK are both taunting/fighting a monster, the monster should always be on the Warrior due to the better taunting.  This will not only maximize the Warrior ability, but maximize the effectiveness for every battle within the group.  Its very inaffective when the SK is taking all the damage done by the monster because his/her taunt is doing better, along with the damage they are doing, while the Warrior has a lot better hp/armor for tanking the monster.  This could affect the amount of healing the Cleric will be doing and overall affect the entire group.  Tell me what you think.<P>Draetor Azmodin<BR>Celestial Alliance<BR>Vazaelle</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Jyoo,<BR>    Yes, your idea would lower taunt somewhat.  But tell me what value a character is when his spells go relatively unused, his hitpoints are low, and he doesn't do much damage.  Damage is our selling point.

Is it balanced that at lvl 60 a PLATE wearing class has LOWER AC than a chain wearing rogue or a Leather wearing MOnk?<P>Lower AC means you get hit more, the high AC armour helps mitigate damage but if your base AC is lower you will get hit everytime.<P>a lvl 60 SK is currently about as good as a lvl 52 warrior for tanking.  Take a lvl 52 warrior into a zone where you normally go as a lvl 60 and watch the tank get torn to shreads.<P>Yeah yeah non balanced groups are fun yada yada,<P>this has nothing to do with the chain classes having better AC than plate classes.<P>Its not our fault that Defense is infinitely more important than AC on armour items.<P>Its an anti twink code they started with so even a twinnked out lvl 10 will still only tank like a lvl 10 and get chewed up by higher lvl mobs.<P><BR>DEFENSE is all you need to know about AC and tanking, the items will come, but when your defense is capped, it doesnt matter if you have a 300AC item, you still get hit all the time by higher lvl mobs.<P>Post lvl 56 SKs and paladins can no longer function like they used to .  Root parking, back up tank, taunter supreme, snare stun, its all a waste post 56 since the mobs are unstunable and tear through the defenses of a paladin/SK like they were a shaman not  a KNight</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I play a druid so I dont have a bias towards either the hybrids or warriors.  And from taking a point of view based on fighting with both class types and from knowing all about each class because I played both types up to level 19 and 21 and have done extensive research on sites like alazham and casters realm to name a few.  ok,  if I played a warrior I would be outraged.  All the changes you have made seem fair except towards hybrids.  How can you possibly compare 300-400 extra hit points to the ability of a paladin.. superiour heal!, resurection!, buffs! there really is no comparison hybrids already have a major edge over warriors.  Look at shadowknights they can EASILY make up for the loss of offense skill with their dots and pet.   From a purely balance perspective I truely feel that paladins should no longer be 80% cleric 80% tank (they have best abilities of both classes) and shadowknights should not be 70% necro 80% tank (they get the most powerful spells of a necro).  I think the hybrids need to be looked over again and their casting abilities reduced greatly they were suppose to be better tanks then casters and with such amazing spells they can play the role of a weaker cleric and a equal tank (with defense increased and their buffs).  <P>solution : raise defense like planned and remove spells like superiour heal and cascading darkness.  Put them more in line with the rangers type spells that although are powerful are not nearly as powerful as having superiour heal and resurection.<P>If you read my huge on-going sentance thanks.  If your a warrior then I truely feel for you and hope verant fixes you up.<P>Oh, and hurry up the superior heal fix for druids.. im 49 and it takes forever to group and I am forced to solo all the time.  I NEED superior heal at 51 I am so bored of soloing and not making new friends.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>  Warrs should let hybrids have the improvements without complaint, but get more of the spells everyone seems to think they all have on items.  Some lower and mid level warrior only weapons that proc snare and stun and still do decent damage would be a good start, as would some reasonably priced or easy to get healing items.<P>  Warriors with the very best gear are GREAT, but they are VERY equipment dependent.  It would be nice if they could duplicate most of the spells and effects of hybrids at their level through equipment.  If hybrids can fight about as well as warrs can, ALL warriors should get roughly the same abilities through equipment.  Seems only fair.<P>  So how about selling items at the guild that have right clickable effects and proc spells about equal to spells hybrids would get at the same level?  Choosing which pieces of armour to wear would be like filling your spell slots.  The better gear would still be quested for, like the best spells/gear for hybrids, but the basic stuff could be sold at the guild.<P>  It still leaves warrs more item dependent, and corpse retrieval would still be a pain, but it would balance out warrs and hybrids at the mid and low levels.  Boost hybrid battle skills, boost warrior casting abilities! 8)<P>  I started a new thread on this, so tell me what you think!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just a couple of things...<P>To Coffin:<BR>You just proved my point.  I can't believe you posted that you never have to find a warrior for your groups.  YOU ARE A WARRIOR, HENCE THERE IS ALWAYS A WARRIOR IN YOUR GROUP!  Warriors have no idea how necessary a warrior is to a group.  Add that to the fact that you KNOW that warrior is neccessary to a group and you think that is ok.  Then add that to the fact that you think that it is also ok that the three hybrid classes should have to fight for that one secondary tank spot.  AND YOU SEE NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS?  <P>/sarcasm on<BR>I understand your point about the four classes (warrior and Palangerknight) having to compete for one spot in a group.  Of course Warriors shouldn't have to compete for a spot!  As long a Coffin is a warrior, let's make it so he doesn't have to go LFG for any length of time.  To help Coffin find a group, let's make the Palangerknight have to LFG for hours trying to compete for that nonexistant SECONDARY tank spot.<BR>/sarcasm off<P>And that brings up another good point about the way warriors think.  Most that are posting here seriously think that "hybrid" is a class.  How can you say that I as a Paladin wont have a penalty for my spells if they increase my defense (not all defensive skills like some have posted)?  MY PENALTY IS THE CRAPPY DAMAGE I DO!!!  How hard is that to see?  The same can be said for SKs and rangers (using offense instead of defense).  <P>You want me to be 75% a warrior and 25% a cleric?  Fine, I glad to see that we agree.  Raise my skills so that I am.  I do a third of the damage a warrior can do and, with the new def cap, I'll be at 75% of the defense (because I still won't be as good at dodge, parry and reposte).  So if a warrior was 50% offense and 50% defence, I'd be roughly 17% offense and 34% defence.  I'm 51% a warrior and 25% a cleric (yeah right), so I, as a paladin, should only be 76% of a whole class?  Hardly seems fair...<P>To Arterius24:<BR>Of course we can out taunt you, we have spells.  Why should a warrior without spells be able to out taunt a hybrid with spells?  Not being able to taunt is the penalty a warrior pays for being the best at taking damage and among best at dealing it (melee wise).  Shoe on the other foot?  How does it feel?<P>Just to reiterate my point, all classes should be wanted in some situations.  As it stands now, some classes are either not wanted or less wanted.  That's not balance.  It's not balance to have two classes have a monopoly on two of the six group slots.  Hybrids need to bring something to the group WITHOUT causing a hardship on the group, or the pros should AT LEAST out weight the cons.  A raise in one skill, defense, isn't going to drastically change things.  It will help a little, but isn't going to be the thing that dethrowns the mighty warrior.<P>It was narrow sighted of Verant to give the exact same skills to hybrids as the parent classes had.  All we are is watered down versions of those classes.  We should be unique (just like cleric and warriors are).  Warriors are right.  With our buffs, we will have more AC than a warrior.  Although that changes when you add the cleric that you NEED into the group.  Then our buffs are useless.  <P>Keep our defense skill the same and give us buffs that stack with clerics.  Warriors wouldn't complain because they'd benefit from our buffs too and would still have their ego fed from having more AC.<P>Logan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>For starters, Logan, my name is Coffinn, not Coffin.  Coffin is a necro on my server and a helluva guy, even when I /auc 'WTT cof for Hiero cloak' in Gfay, then log :0P<P>And yes, for my groups, a warrior IS REQUIRED.  That's because I am a warrior, duh.  But I do NOT believe a warrior is required for every group.  I'm talking hunting for xp here: Chardok, HS, Seb, etc.  Why the hell can't you use any melee class to tank?  I see it all the time.  Every group is different.  I have NEVER seen anyone say in guildchat: "We need a warrior or we can't go to HS!"<P>I thought my post addressed competing for spots rather well, but I guess not.  My point was, that in my experiencs, there's not much competing for a group spot based on class.  You put words in my mouth and said I think Palangerknights should compete for a spot next to a warrior.  Well nowhere did I say or imply that.  I very distinctly said that my groups are a mix of whoever's there.  I've hunted many times with a cleric, paly, 2 sks and a necro.  Why no ranger in that group?  I dunno, maybe we were already full when he logged on.<P>Anyway, sorry I can't oblige your honor and not have a warrior in my group.  I AM a warrior.  you'll have to wait until I level my SK or Rogue up a bit more.<P>Wow, just when I think I make a good post without offending anyone.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First, sorry about the name Coffinn.  Feel free to call me Logann.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>You didn't offend me, it's just that I'm tired of seeing the same argument over and over.  My brother (who's a warrior) and I debate this all the way home from work everyday (and since we commute home in Northern California, that's no small amount of time  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ).<P>A warrior needs to bring something to a group and he does.  A paladin also needs to bring something to a group, but the things that he brings are already covered by two NEEDED classes.<P>I hear people shouting that they need a tank for their group all the time.  I respond but get told they want a "real" tank, a warrior.<P>I hear people in guildchat asking if a warrior is on and willing to group.  I've started pickup groups and had clerics tell me that they wouldn't group unless there was a warrior in the group to protect them.  No warrior = No cleric = No group.  Maybe being a paladin has made me sensitive to these things.  Maybe you don't hear this kind of stuff because it doesn't affect you.<P>Personally, I will always have a spot on a raid.  My guild always tries to include everyone.  I have a great guild, not made up of uber players but UBER people.  The only problem is that I have nothing to do once I get to the raid.  As a matter of fact, it's a running joke in my guild that the paladins in the guild constantly fall asleep (which I'm guilty of).  I was CoH'd around Chardok all night one time.  There was nothing for me to do, so I got bored.  <P>I've been told that I'm a fine paladin.  I try to keep HP topped off.  I risk my HP and XP trying to park mobs so our casters don't get killed.  I've even been called to pull, even though we had a warrior or a monk in a group.  Problem is that I'm seeing this start to dwindle down.<P>When other players had a image of a useless paladin in their heads, I'd prove them wrong.  I loved it and I made lots of friends.  It's getting more difficult to do as time goes on.  Warriors, clerics and all the other classes are exponentially becoming more useful than me, not because of my skill at playing, but the skills and spells that Verant gave me.<P>I have an idea.  Let's get the warriors and paladins together and petition Verant to do something that will help both classes work together.  Two words...

</FONT><HR>A desperate plea from a warrior:<P>As a warrior I am totally reliant upon a group. At lvl 51 a lvl 40 mob wipes the floor with me so fast its embarassing, and I have pretty good equipment. In combat we have no option but to stand and trade blows until either we or the mob dies. If we are in trouble we can't root/snare/feign death and escape, we have to flee for our lives and if we are not SOWed or at a zone line we die everytime. When travelling through a dangerous zone we can't hide, invis or sow, if something attacks us we die. I am not complaining that we cannot solo for xp, that is something I could only dream of, and I am not asking for that ability. I'm saying that we cannot even go explore a zone or get an item that we need on our own.<P>My point is we NEED a group for everything, if we can't get one we can't do anything, even go farm some green mobs to pass the time. So, I would like to suggest that since the warrior is one of the only classes that is TOTALLY reliant on a group for everything, please do not change the balance to make us less wanted. Right now we are wanted in dungeon groups, and not particulary desirable outdoors. Please increase hybrid offence all you like, but DO NOT INCREASE THEIR DEFENCE. The only reason we get groups in dungeons where pets can be a hindrance is because we can take damage better than other classes. We cant heal/snare/root or do anything else benefitial to a group except take damage. And then group must have a good healer to keep us alive.<P>It can take far too much time to find a group, and if I cant find one I have no choice but to log. I can't even go buff some newbies to pass the time. So please, don't do anything that would make us less desirable (relatively) in a group.<P>If I had a suggestion it would be to increase our HP and defence relative to other classes and take away the eye candy like critical hits etc. Triple attack is so often cited as such a great by other classes, but we dont get it until lvl 60 and it is NOT a skill just a very rare random chance. Feel free to remove it I doubt you would hear any complaints.<P>If you think this would unbalance the game then please allow us at least a tiny bit of versatility. How about letting us bind woulds to 70% at lvl 51 instead of at lvl 60? That surely is not too much to ask? Do you think then we would run off and solo like crazy? No, it still would take about 30 bandages to bind up and would certainly not be an option we'd take over a group with a healer.<P>Please please read and consider what I have written.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Vint-you have not a clue.<BR> <BR>Really. At the levels you played hybrids to,the differences are relatively small,yet noticeable. Warriors out-damage me per hit,but not hugely(I'm packing a Stalag terror spear at 27th),but I can taunt at will with DOT/HT stuff.<BR> <BR>As you go higher,the AC/HP-the "tanking" capacity of meleers-gap spreads further and further apart,until post 50 it starts to get critical. Monsters at that level shred hybrids that try and tank. Rangers become liabilites with ubertaunt combat styles and no defense. Lower HP/AC means the SK and paladin(who get the same buffs as the warrior in the party,trust me on this) get shredded faster AND do less damage. It's a double whammy that gets hybrids shafted on both ends.<BR> <BR>Taken to the extreme,which is the top-tier stuff of "uber" fame,it means SK's and paladins are NOT wanted in the fight. Each one is one more strain on the zone's capacity to handle the multiple groups there pumping out incredibly obscene firepower. Each one is one less cleric or effective tank to maintain the combat.<BR> <BR>We become a liability to the very parties we join doing so. And we know it. And it really,really sucks.<BR> <BR>If we could even do PART of the job of a warrior,we'd have some reason to be there as tanks. We can't at the top,and it's a strain post-50 even though we can. We have a negative impact once we can't do our job like we should,and that's wrong.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi I am Terroram and I curretnly play a level 32 warrior on the Quellious server and I find that a warrior can easily outdamage hybrids, rogues, and if properly equipped monks... I really think that no matter what happens people will stick with the Warrior and Monk as the group tanks I see that the changes in the hybrid classes a benefit to groups. For example yesterday in Lower Guk I was grouped with an ogre SK who was 5 levels higher than me and during fights we would both really take an equal amount of damage but my HP would hardly move and his would go down to half health. With this extra HP and AC I think that youll see more fearless groups ready to take on anything and dungeons will be popular again, I think this is great my favorite part of the game is when at level 32 I can go down to a dungeon clear a camp and get some awesome exp while hanging out with high levels... anyway lets get back on subject I think that this just shows that Warriors are needed I find that when I shout in FM or Lguk that I am a warrior I get plenty of tells asking to help a group out although I may be the first one to die in the group but so what! Thats what tanks like warriors are for thats why we have high health and high ac and the changes to hybrids mean more fun more raids LESS DYING! As a litle Coldain in Thurgadin says "I just want to slay some dragons save a princess or two, nothing crazy like calculate out what are the best weapons to use and debate about things on public forums..." Ok enough with my hobo style rant to summarize what I just said Warriors are AWESOME changes are GOOD... HAVE FUN!!!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/054905-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/054905.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/054905-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=054905&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=054905&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
