This would be especially good in light of some of the LAME pathing in some dungeons.<P>An improved flare spell that throws out a number of them in diff directions simultaneously.<P>Succor Hero, sends member of the party to zone "safe spot".<P>On a side note how about makeing banish summoned work like the lure line of wizz spells and make them hard to resist and upping the mana to damage ratio a bit.  As it is they are pointless to mem.  They get resisted just as often as a regular DD and the damage ratio on them is in line with the regular dd spell.  Why should I waste one of my precious mem slots with this crap spell?<P>Summon poison, make it take some cheap re-agent and make it something not too strong.  Just nice to have for rogue when he forgets his own or runs out.<P>Make the Ele armor line of spells usable on other players.  It would be nice to have just ONE buff to hand out.  To keep it in line make it so it does not stack with the druid spells.<P>A lower level group DS, maybe at 39 or so.<P>Summon Fishing pole, no rent.

</FONT><HR>Oh...I hope you read my reply Absor...<P>A bubble.<P>It would be a low mana cost, conjuration based spell.  While it is in use, the mage would not be able to have a pet out, and no more than 1 Bubble at a time.<P>The Bubble would be like a Mesmerize spell, having a moderate duration and low mana cost.  If the monster gets hit, it breaks and is once again agro.  Since it counts as a pet, the mage would not be able to have more than one at a time, making the uses of this spell limited...but woudl also give another option for moderate crowd control...just an idea.<P>  It would encourage mages to explore without pets and use different spells; Rage of Zomm, Eye of Zomm/Talon.<P>I believe mages should get more spells that count as a 'pet' so they can go around without one and still be able to do things.<P>                   ******<P>A different idea...mages should get racial pets.  I don't wanna take much more of your time so would make this short.<P>High elves might get Faeries with paladin like abilities (hopefully you could code it so they would buff and heal the mage too...would be nice).<P>Gnomes a type of clockwork with some enchanter abilities...<P>Dark elves could have orcs which would be shamans.<P>Erudites could get snakes, perhaps being druids...<P>I wanted to be brief, so please don't just disregard my ideas...good luck in finding new spells!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Its very clear that many wish to have a summoned armor, or and many non perishable items. I agree about the armor idea, in the sence that it isnt to overdone. If we mage were able to summon armor it musont be to powerful for the classes would be unbalanced. This goes for any class. Now the non perishable (after log or LD) items were implimented for a similar reason. If items were didnt disappear after log, of any sort, this might encourage the constant use of them. Newbies would not adventure or quest for better items. Just a thought.<P>Thanks, <BR>Lulianiel 22 magician<BR>The Elven Aliance <BR>xegony<P>ps, the elven alliance is looking for new qualified members. Im one in part of rebuilding the guild.

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Hey i've read most of these post and can honestly tell you that most of the replies here are BS...  I like the idea of summoning armor even though it would not be feasable or likely to happen...You really should look into giving us better weapons to summon though...of all the weapons that mages summon only the staves and daggers are usable by mages and no one uses them..the only summoned items ppl want are arrows, mod rods, swords for pets, heat/cold/water stones..I also think that there should be a no rent no drop lore item that can give us mana...mod rods just will not do=(  wizards get harvest, necro's get call of bones...what do we get a crappy mod rod..hell you could put double the time with it than what wizards get for theirs but we need something to equalize us with the other caster classes..well thats it for now...if i get anything else i'll post it<P><BR>p.s.  as for my station name a friend changed it and i have no clue how to change it back =(</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>   Okay, I finally read all the posts, and I like some of the stuff I'm seeing, but a lot is just unrealistic garbage.<P>   One point I like is that us Mages dont really have an exclusive class defining ability, except "We can summon a lot of garbage." Other classes are slowly tapping into out summoning skills, why not let us tap a bit into theirs? Nothing earth shattering like free clarity sticks or something...<P>  To start changing our summons, I'd remove nearly all of our current summoned weapons. We cant even use most of them, and no one else wants to either! Replace them with mage usable weapons at lower levels, and then weapons more geared for pets at later levels.<BR>   For procs on weapons, we need more diversity. With the fix of Sword of Runes, our arsenal was hurt, bit reasonably so. This is one of the spells we should definately keep, because it does have a use. But, we also need at least 1 weapon each with a magic based proc, and a fire based proc. Mages are all about elementals, fire, and magic - this wouldnt be a stretch at all.<P>   For general purpose summonings, I'd like to see summon food/water work like summon bandages as others have mentioned. As an upgrade, let us summon different types of food every 10-15 levels. That black bread makes me nauseous.<BR>   Summon Ale would be a nice lower level skill, but I'm happy where it is. If it is added as a lower level summon, I'd also like to see other drinks like champagne and wine. Mages like to drink occasionally, but they're not too fond of ale. Especially us high elves.<BR>   An upgrade to Coldstones would be nice, as others have mentioned. Ultravision and See Invis together would be a nice upgrade.<P>   Summoned armor would be very nice, but I wouldnt want a whole set of armor like others have suggested. My spellbook is cluttered enough! Give me summonable robes, with random color and style. I know the random color and style bit probably wouldnt get in, but I had to suggest it.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Add duplicates to the Phantom line that created real wearable chest armor, with the hp regen effect built in. Make sure the effect doesnt stack with the Phantom line though.<P>   Fun stuff! Bristlebanes Bundle is my favorite spell so far! I spent 30 minutes yesterday getting the whole north wall of Karnor's drunk and dizzy.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> More little games like the Spinning Bottle would be nice at lower levels. Dont make us wait until 52nd level to have fun!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>   A few people have mentioned things along the lines of 'pulling a rabbit out of a hat', and I think thats a great idea - but hard to implement. Best alternative I can think of would be the ability to summon a mob like the monster summoning lines do, but make it not be a pet. Have it create a totally independant mob, with 1 hp and 0 damage potential. Unless you can get rabbits in the global file, then I want to make little rabbits hop all over.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>   Stuff thats not really what you meant by summoning spells... Summon Mob would be great, but I'm not sure if I'd want it. As a mage at higher levels, the last thing you want is to be sitting right next to whatever you're fighting. Could also be abused. You want a Sand Giant at the docks in Oasis? Well, okay! ::bzzt:: I also wouldn't want to be spammed with all the pulling mages yelling "You will not evade me a_wurm_03!" I think a better spell would be Summon *to* Mob. This would teleport you to the targetted mob. This could be our 'SoW', as well as a pulling aide. There would have to be a maximum but generous range on the target, but it could work and be useful, provided the casting time and cost was relatively low.<BR>   Summon Pet would also be a great addition, and I cant really think of any bad sides of this one. It'd make pulling easier in cases where its easier to have your pet follow you into the field. Pet get stuck on some crazy mob? Summon him back, little bugger!<BR>   Summon Muck/Entanglement/something... Acts as snare on a mob, with different spell sparklies and emotes. Yes, this steals snaring from other classes, but that goes into the tapping into other classes ablities I wrote about way up at the top. Is it that much of a stretch to think a mage could summon a glob of mud to slow down a running critter? We wouldnt be swiping any other classes 'class defining ability', all sorts of classes can snare. Only problem would be that mages would now have a controlable way to slow down a mob, which we've never really had before. There'd be kiting mages everywhere, and I'm not sure I'd want that.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Okay, I have more ideas, but this post is too long, so I'll leave with 1 more......<BR>   Summon Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth. Come on, this thing drops 2-3 times a year! At least the other items for our epic quest have a chance of dropping more than once a week. Not that I'll ever finish it, but if this was changed I'd have a tiny chance.<P>That it, thanks for reading all my bunk.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Nalinie<BR>54th Mage on Veeshan<BR>Head Disciplinarian of Guardian Council</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As a reasonably low-level magician, I would LOVE to be able to look forward to be able to summon some armor that, I, as a Magician could wear. Especially being on Rallos-Zek, robes don't last long, so It would be friggin' amazing to be able to impress your friends, and look like a Paladin or SK, even though you are wielding a Stien of Moggok and a Shovel. Something like: Summon Chain Armor. It would basically act as a robe saying that it covers the whole model's body, but It provides some what minimal ac, but is also light, and may even have an effect. I don't know, nothing too powerfull... Shield of Fire? 2 charges? But any way...

Just make sure that anything you got in that bags stays after LD (even summoned stuff) and let it turn to 100lbs after reconnect.

</FONT><HR>I think one thing that alot haven't mentioned is something for our pets. Instead of just summoning more items, why don't we make mages THE summoner of pets. We should be able to cast spells on our pets and pets only that buff them, like burnout, except cleric type spells. I know this may seem like too much, but say at like 34 we got a spell that added, I don't know, 30Ac or something reasonable. And then at level 39 we got a spell that would add like 125hp or something. And I think we should be able to have some shammy buffs as well. The Burnout line adds strength, so like at 24 a stamina buff, or say at 29 an agility buff or something to show those necros that we truly are the masters of pets, b/c right now, our pets and theirs are rather close in what they can do, but these spells would make us masters of the elements. I think this is much better than wasting a new spell on a staff that casts see invis or something dumb that we already have. Its not that hard to see invis group, takes about 20 seconds, but this would be worht it. I'm open to feedback if you guys have any ideas on whats good or bad about this idea.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wow, I can't believe this thread actually has come up...  I'd like to see:<P>1.  Some sort of summon mob.  Of course, you couldn't just highlight a mob from far away and summon it to you (well, you could, but that would be just a tad bit unbalancing).  I'd like to see some sort of spell which lets you summon a mob that is already aggro'd on you.  This would have several uses, such as summoning a mob that for some strange reason has disappeared or fell into a pit of some sort (while your group was fighting it) in a dungeon.<P>2.  Summon pet.  I know we can summon pets out of malachite (lol), but this would summon your pet back to you if it got lost.  Such a spell would have to be low mana though, since we can already go  invis and just summon another pet.  The purpose of this spell would be to save mana (and malachite if you're cheap :P).<P>3.  Summoning armor   would be interesting, but I do believe it should be a low lvl spell (good luck soloin' your way back to your corpse in the hole or solb, or any other of the higher lvl dungeons).  If it is a high lvl spell, I do think the armor should be no drop, and it should be sufficient to provide us with enough attributes to group up and work our way back to the corpse.<P>4.  Summon a no rent item which gives permanent enduring breath.  This would be an upgrade to summon waterstone, and since we already have an item that does this with ultravision, I don't see why this one should not exist.<P>5.  Since magicians are the only pure casters who do not have a spell which helps, in some way, regain mana faster (mod rods do not do this, they require mana and then just give it back), there should be some kind of item which would do this for us.  Nothing that gives clarity or anything like that (although it would be nice :P), but something that perhaps takes your pet's HP slowly and slowly adds on to mana regeneration?<P>6.  Oh, almost forgot.  Summon Gfay.  If we can't port to different parts of the world, lets summon the different parts of the world to us!  lol, I just had to   throw this in :P.<P>Sslan, 51 mag on TZ</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I had lots of ideas when first seeing this thread, but a lot of it has already been said, Seeing as how I want my say though, I'll just reiterate the ideas of others that I agree with.  <P>Rod of Binding: I fail to see what is unbalancing about this idea.  A No Rent/Lore item that has one charge of bind affinity with the same location restrictions as normal melee binding.  The whole reason we've been given for there not being NPC's in town that will bind Melee's is because it would do away with class interdependence.  Well, this item would still make them dependant on Casters, except now they would be able to /tell a_Level_??_Mage Can you summon me a Rod of Binding? BEFORE embarking on their trip instead of having to /shout Can somebody bind me please? when they get there.<P>Call of the Traveller (CoH across zones): Makes Mages even more attractive to groups...  Makes an interesting sort of travel spell for Mages too.  Something that doesn't benefit us directly but allows us to help others.<P>CoH-style Summon Pet: Please?  We can summon our groupmates to us, but can't summon the creature that we brought to this plane with our own magic?<P>Charm Summoned: This just makes too much sense, really.  Same with Fear Summoned.  It's situational, but then that's what we're all about isn't it?<P>Summoned Spear for either Primary or Secondary hand: I just want to see my pet dual-weilding spears.<P>Upgrades to our pet healing spells: The last one we get is at level 20?  Doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  I agree with the person who said that Renew Conjuring and Renew Voceration need to be in.<P>Big Pet Heal: One of the things I'd like to see is a spell that would restore something like 50% of your pet's health, but stun you for 10 seconds like the Wizard's Harvest spell.  One of those save your butt kinda things...<P>Let us use our summoned water in trade skills...  I mean, is it really all that unbalancing?  At least it would give us a slight edge.  It would be really nice if we could summon something else that would be useful in tradeskills, but that's probably not going to happen.<P>Being able to change money would be nice, being able to summon a coin-weight-reducing item would be even better.<P>The idea that I like the most would have to be the solution to summoned bags poofing on LD.  Making them change into 50 or 100 wt bags when you log back in is PERFECT.  You still have to summon new bags (unless you enjoy carrying around a 100wt 4-slot bag), but at least the stuff that you had in them isn't gone.  As it stands, the summoned bags are VERY underused.  I've lost enough good items (including a full set of cured silk that I was very proud of myself for tailoring) to make me VERY wary of putting anything but other summoned items in them.<P>Ah, and one thing that I just saw in the last post...  a spell to leech HP off of our pet and give us mana would be PERFECT.  Sure we'd get mana regen, but at a pretty high price.  That and the fact that we'd pretty much have to be in a group so that the hp drain didn't mean a quick death for our pet (and thus: for us), and we all know that grouping is a Good Thing (tm).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The comodities that people ask for in game all have to do with a common theme.  Sow, clarity, teleports, rezzes.  All have one thing in common: time, and how to save it.  Time is the most valuable comodity in the game.  In order to be more group friendly, mages will need to summon things that make the most of peoples time!<BR>Unless VI can come up with a whole new series of spell that will be in demand, mages can only work on tangents of other class spells.  So without further adue:<P><BR>1)Improved mod rod.  More charges.  I am tired of casting and handing over and clicking trade repeatedly to recharge my cleric.  (currently necros and chanters are masters of mana, would it kill to make one more caster more group friendly?) level 55<P>2) Shrink rod.  (shamen are too rare, ogres are plentiful) level 44-49<P>3) Weapons that proc useful magics.(snare, stun,  fireDD, iceDD, good AE spells -- not 30ae dmg)<P>4) self gate rod, tradable. (level 58-59, similar to wizard translocation)<P>5) purse of 100% coin weight reduction, weighs 2.0<P>6) Inter-zone summons, limited to continent perhaps, or to 2 zones over.<P>7) Leeching hp from pet for mana. *****most desirable imo*****<P><BR>Please see Desi's post on Mage Talk.

</FONT><HR>Okay, I just finished reading all the posts on the string.<P>I have to say, much of it is unrealistic.<P>Starting with the ATM\Merchant - MAYBE have summon bank, at 60, however, no merchant.  I could see access to the bank though, and only allow it personal access.<P>Summon armour - I like this, and I agree with it, however, my suggestion is to have the stats raise on it as your level increases, that way you only have to use one item slot, and it still works per level.<P>Summon pet weapons - agreed, weapons for only pets, decent weapons.  I mean, burnout is nice, and the heals are okay at our levels, but why not pet only weapons and armour?  If my pet is supposed to be a tank, let's make him a tank.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I like the weight reducing items, and so would a lot of people.  Obviously they have to be lore, and ridiculously high in both level and mana, but they'd be quite useful.  No one wants to use bags, as was said before, because lost connections are an increasing problem.<P>Summon pet is a long overdue spell.<P>As a magician, your life goes along these lines....your nukes are nerfed, you can only heal your pet, and your fighting ability relies upon something that you don't know the statistics for, so you can't reliably read the capabilities of it.  A dodgy life at best.  I gained about 5 levels travelling back and forth from as far west as Odus, to as far east as Felwithe, because I refused to go to Kunark.  In that time, I rarely managed to join any groups, because no one wants a mage, and I have to say I've seen more of the world than most do in their careers.  Which is impressive for someone with no SoW.  <P>The only way I've found to actually get in a group, is to start your own.  I've gotten good at that.<P>Finally, I'd like to address the topic of summoning anything rentable, and only to say that anything rentable should be nodrop.  It would be too powerful to be able to summon anything that is worth anything at a store, or can be dropped.  So I feel it's necessary in this case.<P>I've got a few other points to address, but being a novice magician, I'll leave it as I have said.  This is my first character of any time, and I've been playing for about two months.  In that time, I just made 24 last night.<P>I apologize for going off the topic in this post, but I wanted to make sure people knew where I was coming from, and my points were clear.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This goes in more of a "fun" catagory, or maybe it would be too powerful to even consider. But how about a "summon beast", "call of the monster" type spell that would work very similar to the regular pet summons. The spell would look at all mobs available in the current zone, and if any are in the appropriate level range for this pet summon spell you would get a duplicate of this mob with all its normal abilities(probably going to have make some exceptions here), but of course it's melee abilities/max damage would be the same of the typical pet of that level. Also the mana pool in case of getting a casting mob would have to be drastically reduced. If no mob is in the zone of the appropriate level you get a message such as, "your call/summons goes unanswered." Basically I see this as mostly cosmetic and fun, but workable till before about the 40's. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>X-Raptor-x, Heh that is exactly what I was thinking about at first, but then I realized it would mean really limiting the spell (and you would see everyone running around with the most infamous things, "Hail a newbie01, say hello to my pet Dvinn!"), to balance it, say you wanted a sand giant pet for instance, the spell would have to be at earliest one of the level 39 series. Keeping with how the regular summon pet series works, the way I described it you still have that random level result, ie, level 4 spell: level 3 to 5 pet, level 24 spell: level 20 to 24 pet, etc.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This may sound like a stupid list, but here are my opinions: <P>Mages should, as masters of pets, get to summon more than one pet.  Say about 1 additional pet at lvl 15, 2 at lvl 30, etc(only 4 pets at lvl 60).  Certainly this could be overbalancing, but mages only get spells that are meant to be fun, and have no combat value at later levels.  We have nowhere near the DD potential of a wizzard, dot's of a necro, buffs and heals of the shamans, druids, and clerics,  while our pets don't do nearly as much damage as melee classes.  Our pets are the only thing we have that is keeping us around, so we should be incredibly good with pets.  <P>the summon bindstone/gatestone ideas are great<P>More summon types, such as summon demon/angel, summon dragon, or summon (some monster that drains mana & interrupts casting very often)  all of these would neccessarily be of extremely high level.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I believe Mages the master of summoning should have the ability to summon no drop no rent boots of running like Jboots and also have the ability to summon gate or portal rings that are no drop no rent items with a single charge. That would make wizards and druids mad but hey you did allow Shadow Knights to use the summon corpse spell once highly reserved for the necromancer.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1. Glasses or a monocle that allow you to see how much damage your pets castings are doing.  <P>2. A rod that you can give your pet to increase its magic restitance.  Make this spell available only on  blue servers to limit the PVP impact.<P>3. A more group friendly pet at higher lvls(50+).  This pet would have only 600 or so hitpoints.  The pet would hit for roughly 25-30% more than a comparable summon (say 54 water).  This pet would be useless in soloing yet a great boon for grouping.<P>4.  More summons along the line of shard of the core.  A summoned shield with a unique look to it would be nice. ( AC 12 +10 to all resists) NO DROP.<P>5.  A higher lvl summoning of mod rod (say 55) that would allow 2-3 charges of modulate.<P>6.  A 50+ summon ring that allows permanent levitate.  Have this take components( cats eye agate 4 of them). <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One summon (mentioned before):<BR>Summon Bind Rod: No Rent Lore Magic &lt;not no drop&gt;<BR>one charge of Bind Self (new self only bind spell).  <P>This way the meleer will still have to find a real person if they need a bind, however if no one in the zone is binding they can search for a mage of appropriate level to summon them a Bind rod which they can take back to a spot to bind themselves.  This creates *more* interaction than the current system of sitting in a zone shouting for a bind until someone takes pitty on you.  Instead you would wander in search of a mage to summon you a bind rod.  The mage wouldn't have to leave his group to escort you to the bind spot and thus would probably be more amiable to provide this service.<P>Make the spell about lvl 20 so that the mages who have it might still be close to the newbie bindable zones.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Lets see you fix the sword of runes first of all. Then lets summon some staffs. Right click, 1-?? charges. Multi-fireballs fly out. Doesn't have to do too much damage but would look cool. Then lets summon a ridable animal of some sort. I wanna ride a monkapotamous. The thing that was at lewis's work on the drew carry show. Then lets summon a bind ring to give out to people so they arnt SCREWED everywhere they go to have to egt a bind. Then lets summon a magical item for each inventory armor slot. Let's replace the old elementals with spirits or demons. I would also like to see some summoned stuff with their very own animation. Summon staff of runes should show a staff with glowing etched runes on the side. Lets get some 1HBs for us mages and some procing weopons. I also would like to see us with more powerful expel summon spells. No reason druids should be stronger there than the master summoner. Also pop in a vulcan cannon you can give to the earth pet. I wanna see us gnome mages tinker some kinda weopon. Guns should replace the poor mans bow. I wanna see devastation. How about some summon multiple pets too. You get a extra one each level down. You level 20 you get 2 16's as pets. You level 20 you get 3 12's as pets. You level 20 you get 4 8's as pets. And so on.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

After half an hour they poof.  Give about a minute of warning, so it shouldn't affect LD.
