</FONT><HR>Absor wrote:<P>"Well, a better analogy would be:<P>Assume that there is only one car model that can drive over 90 miles an hour. This car is indeed very expensive and hard to get. Let's say that the speed limit is 90 miles an hour. Then someone realizes, perhaps way too late, that driving that fast is dangerous, not only to the driver but to society as a whole. Are you suggesting that the speed limit should not be lowered, just because a few people own a car that can surpass that speed limit?"<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;This analogy isn't correct either.  In your analogy, my item can still do what it could before the change.  It hasn't been nerfed.  I can still go 90mph... it's just that now if I get caught doing it, I'll get a speeding ticket.  But my item has the *same* performance I *paid* for.<P>"We think that leaving this item in the game as it is will harm the entire game. Therefore we are changing it."<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;You missed my point entirely.  My question to you is, okay, if you nerf Donals BP, how will people be compensated for the reduction in performance of this item?<P>You said you didn't understand why if the change only affected 0.05% of the people, why it was such a big deal.  And you still failed to acknowledge my explaination.  Here it is again, not only for the Donal's nerf, but EVERY TIME you nerf an item in the game:<P>1. Player spends X amount of quantifiable effort/time/plat to obtain item Y.  Item Y has stats and effects equal to a quantifiable amount Z.<P>2. If a player spends X effort/time/plat to obtain item Y that can do Z, it can be said that Z is worth X.<P>3. Verant comes in and nerfs item Y by a set amount N.  Now item Y has stats and effects equal to Z-N<P>4. Stats and effects equal to Z-N is worth an amount that is less than X.<P>5. Players are not compensated for this difference in X when you nerf item Y.  This is a loss they take because Verant did no testing or lacked foresight before adding item Y with stats/effects Z into the game.  THIS IS WHY PEOPLE FEAR EVERY PATCH MESSAGE!  For them, there is NO way to reclaim that lost X.<P>Example:<BR>You, Absor, save up enough platinum to buy a Sword of the Uber from someone for 300,000pp.  I think we can all agree that obtaining 300,000pp would take a lot of time and effort, and is a MAJOR investment.  But that's okay, because the Sword of the Uber is a one-handed slash weapon that does 20 damage with a delay of 23.  It also procs the effect Ice Comet and has 40 AC, +10 to all saves, and +5 to all attributes.  It's pretty darn sweet, and in your mind, well worth the 300,000pp you just shelled out.<P>The next day, in the patch message, Verant says that the Sword of the Uber is unbalancing and must be nerfed.  Now it has a damage of 10, a delay of 27, procs the effect Flame Lick, has no AC, a few +3 saves, and only a +5 STR attribute modifier.  Is this weapon still worth the 300,000pp you paid for it yesterday?  I don't know about you, but I wouldn't pay more than 2500pp for this sword.  So good luck recovering that 300,000pp you spent for what just became a mediocre sword.  Sucks, doesn't it?  If you said you'd take the loss and not complain, you'd by lying through your teeth.<P>Do you understand this now?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>In addition to my above post, since X time/effort/plat can pretty much be directly translated into time (it takes time to obtain plat, it takes time to get the level and gear necessary to take down the mob or complete the quest that yields item Y), when you nerf item Y, you are taking time away from us.<P>Valuable time, I might add.  Time that we are paying $10 a month to spend playing your game.<P>If we spend three months getting enough plat to buy item Y, and you nerf it to the point where it now only takes one month getting enough plat to buy item Y with reduced performance Z-N, then you just practically stole $20 (two months worth of playing the game to obtain that platinum) from us.<P>Please refute this logic, because after thinking through this, I just made myself sick to my stomach thinking how much real-life money all these nerfs indirectly cost us.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There lies your problem Absor, is the Manastone overpowering?  Yes, even in its current form, a part of the game is EASY with people who know how to exploit the manastone (note NOT illeagally) <P>When people were being denied plane raids because of this one item you deemed it "overpowering" and changed it to not work in RoK, Planes, SoV(Has anyone tested this?)but that leaves alot of the "old" world vunerable.<P>You should have just made the mana/hp ratio so bad as to make it only useable as a last resort tactic for mana &lt;shrug&gt;<P>NOW we come to the Donal's BP.<P>&lt;shakes his finger at Verant&gt;<P>Now you think this solution will change anything?  It wont, here is why.  Even with the 30 second cast time, on mobs where a fighter/cleric combo (only them) cant kill in 30 secs they most certainly can do with the cleric regaining mana fast enough to CH with mana regen.<P>Thus the BP is worthless.<P>Now on mobs that can kill the warrior (im talking 60th level fully buffed 5k+hps) in 30 secs the BP is ALSO WORTHLESS.  So now other tactics are needed.  You see your "team" really needs to go on a raid where the mob in question is killing people WITHOUT incredable AE's just meleeing them into the ground and you will see CH is not an option unless its the mana kind.  The 30 sec. nerf already made this item so that it was EASY for a warrior/cleric combo to kill the MoB's that they could already kill WITH mana.  Nerfing it more is not needed, trust me.  This BP with the 30 sec nerf is USELESS on the big raids.<P>I know this post is fruitless but if your trying to make it so that this BP is not abused then do this instead.<P>Make it so that only ONE BP can heal one PC at a time.<P>Sound confusing?<P>Use your option of the 7.5 min "effect" once casted on only that person can be Donald CH by the same BP.  So now you "Bind" the BP to the person it heals for 7.5 mins.<P>THAT is a real nerf, but still gives the effectiveness to one person AND removes what you probably are thinking of.<P>Multiple clerics with Donalds(my pet name for Donals BP) BP healing one tank and killing the big mobs.<P>My solution fixes that problem and dosent really 'nerf' the item just makes it so you cant heal the entire zone for a LONG time.<P>Think about it, use some creative grey matter, think it out.<P>I would like to point out something else.<P>You (Verant) made a mistake by allowing this item into the game in the first place, you have done so with many items.  Why not hone your item creation process?  Why make the players 'suffer' an unwanted nerf.<P>Do a pole.<P>Whether for good or bad, do you like it when Verant has to 'Nerf' (ie Change) an item for ANY reason?<P>I bet you get 90%+ of NO. <P>Think about what you are doing to the game every time you nerf something.  I think it hurts you more than helps you even if the change is for the better because it tells people you didnt get it right, so your trying to save face.<P>I dont think that is the case I understand the problems with programming big application(s) such as these, especially with dynamic properties such as EQ.  However I do believe that, once all variables are known (and you should know all the var's involved) that adding content (items and quests) should never need to be 'nerfed' that is where testing comes in.  <P>Wow getting longer that I wanted so Ill stop here. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oh, and before it comes down:<P>Yeah, I had the Scimitar of the Mistwalker nerfed on me, too.  And it had the same potential to make or break raids that the Cleric BP does.  <P>Now, if the pre-nerf SotM were still in place, and a couple of rangers with these could make the difference on these mobs (and it could have - especially with the new werewolf buff to add 100 to dex - only requirement being that the mob not cast AoE's) - would you be screaming that this was a patently unfair nerf?<P>They explained how the item could be abused.  They explained that no single item should be that powerful.  And I had to agree.  It -sucked-, it was THE item I wanted above all others (believe me), but I absolutely could not find fault with their logic, nor was I going to put my own "status" above the health of the game.  So I didn't complain, or whine.<P>Call me jealous all you want, but game balance is FAR more important a consideration to me.  And I -took- it when the uberitem nerf came at my class, and I didn't whine, so don't you -dare- call me any kind of a hypocrite.<P>Qwinn Windfletcher<BR>51st Ranger<BR>Tunare Server<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I must respectfully disagree with the majority of the posters on this thread.  I understand the frustration of having worked hard for something only to have it taken away.  However, I feel that the reward is in the process of getting the item, not necessarily the item itself.  If you feel you have to work and put yourself through a bunch a pain to get something, all you are doing is setting yourself up for more pain.  If you enjoy the process of getting the item, then what the item is doesn't really matter so much.  If you find the process of getting the item so painful as to feel you need to be compensated, perhaps you don't really enjoy playing Everquest.<P>I have a friend who plays the game much more than I.  He is very "item focused".  By that I mean almost all his energy is spent trying to get the next better item than what he has.  Whenever I talk to him, he is frustrated, angry and upset at how difficult it is for him to achieve his goal.  Sometimes I catch him just after he gets something he wants.  Then he is estatic, almost intolerably so.  He want's to let everyone know what a great player he is for finally getting whatever it is he got.  However, the euphoria doesn't last long.  Pretty soon he's off chasing the next item and into depression again.  I don't play with him much anymore.<P>I am more "challenge focused" than my friend.  I prefer to seek out new things to try and new places to go.  Most of the time it gets me killed.  My equipment at my level makes some people laugh.  I don't really care.  I have a great time playing EQ.  No matter where I am, I can find something challenging to do.  The only time I lose is if I complete the challenge too easily.  When that happens, I log off and work on my juggling or something. ;-)<P>I don't know if I'm playing the same game as my friend sometimes.  I often ask him, "what will you do when you have all the items you could ever want?".  "Start a twink." is his usual reply.  I don't know what he'll do when he has 8 level 60 characters on our server.  Probably go do it again on another server.  Is that all there is to EQ?  Try to make the most powerful character so you can show everyone else you are better than they are?  It seems like only the person at the top would be winning the game then.  And only as long as they can hold off the next in line.  I don't want to play that game.<P>All I'm trying to say is that the real reward is know you took down Trakanon.  No amount of nerfing can take that from you.  You rose up and met one of the greatest challenges in the game.  If the change to Donal's breastplate means that some mobs are difficult or impossible, then all the more satisfaction you would get from being able to defeat them.<P>I realize that most people play the game for the tangible rewards.  I just want to offer another viewpoint.  Kudos to Verant for being willing to take control of their game and make it what they want it.  I would not play a game that has no challenge.<P>Cheers,<BR>Phread28</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The currently proposed solution is just overboard.  It requires a LOT of special case coding.  You can't seriously expect a cleric to count for 7.5 minutes until this buff wears off on someone so he can cast a BP again.<P>Two very simple options.<P>1.  Change the effect to a large fixed amount heal (like an upgraded divine light) and adjust the casting time.  <P>2.  Change the effect to an upgraded Celestial Elixer-like spell.  This has the added benefit of preventing clerics from stacking BP heals on a single person.<P>Keep it simple.  There's no need for this strange kludge solution you have proposed.  If either of the two above solutions don't turn out right, adjust the healing and casting time.  Rinse and repeat until you get it right.<P>The cleric class is asking you not to go overboard on this.  Take a deep breath, step back, and make some rational changes.  Don't turn this into another Mark of Karn where you implement some strange solution that turns out to be utterly useless.  Just because the item was very good before does not mean you have to totally destroy it now.<P>You cannot set a goal for people such as this item and then tear it into shreds once it's achieved.  Adjust as far as you need to to preserve your game balance, but go any further than that and you are arbitrarily destroying the thousands of man-hours in effort that your player have put into obtaining it.

</FONT><HR>I really feel sorry for Verant on this one. Some item in game can make a cleric and a warrior basically kill almost any mob in game (few exceptions) by themselves, which to me would call for an item correction. I mean there is no way to call this 'nerf' a 'nerf'.<P>The more people cry wolf for such an obvious mistake it takes dozens and dozens of valid complaints and makes people's cries for those complaints go unheard.<P>If people will complain about an item that does a complete heal and recharges every 30 seconds and think it shouldn't be changed then I don't know what they wouldn't complain about. If I had this item I would say to myself, 'this is too good to be true', and I'm sure the clerics that have it and the people they group with said the same thing. So now Verant is going to fix it and some of those same people are complaining that the item shouldn't be changed...<P>I feel bad for Verant for taking any heat on this item change or feeling they needed to even get into this much detail of the items changing. I hear, cleric can do full heal on a player every 30 seconds, meaning as long as the warrior isn't fighting something that can kill him under 30 seconds then they will never die...that's all I needed to nod my head and think, well, that makes sense :)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

This had been brought up by others saying this BP was too powerful, and Abashi made a post justifying this item as its so difficult, and so rare to get, very few exist [like less than 10] per server, therefore doesnt imbalance anything.  Well, it got nerfed anyway, and now you are nerfing it again.<P>This is sad.  On ALL servers combined there are likely less than (or barely over) 100 total of these breastplates.  Now, taking this "So overpowering" item into consideration, look at this item:<P>Chestplate of Stability<BR>MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM  NO DROP<BR>AC: 42<BR>Effect: Celestial Elixir<BR>+7 STA, +13 WIS, +5 INT, +50 HP, +60 Mana, +2 FR, +3 DR, +3 CR, +7 MR, +2 PR<BR>WT: 8.0<P>There are PLENTY more of these per server than Donals BP.  WHY DID YOU MAKE THE ABOVE BREASTPLATE IF THE DONALS WAS TOO OVERPOWERING?!?!  Verant, I just don't understand your logic sometimes.  Please help me understand - Seriously, I want to know.  CH is a level 39 spell, and CE is a level 59 spell.  This spell regens 1,550 HP over 24 seconds.  Certainly not as powerful as complete healing, but with at least 5 to 10 times the numbers of stability BPs out there as opposed to donals BPs, it imbalances the game more.<P>Again, Verant, PLEASE explain to me the reason for this.

I have nothing to do with this directly since I don't play clerics, but I happen to agree that it is overpowered, and should be (ahem) nerfed.  However, since there will now be a severe delay in recast time on the same individual, maybe the casting time can be brought back down so that it makes more sense to cast it in battle, and not just as a downtime reducer.  How is that for some sort of compromise (and I also do not know of anyone personally who has this breastplate on Tarew Marr, although I hear there are three from my discussions on it in Hate the other night).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor is correct in that the BP should NOT be the sole reason that someone would create a cleric.  However, who can argue that ANY of the similar BPs are not HIGHLY sought after?  They are extremely nice items by design.  I agree that the Donal's BP has a lot of potential to be exploited, and has been in the past.  I think, however, that 7.5 minutes PER TARGET is FAR more than an inconvenience, it simply kills the item's effectiveness.  When you are fighting, you WANT the best tank to be taking the hits.  The mob doesn't go "oh look, he got CHed I think I'll go after someone else now to help the cleric out" =)  If you want to make some kind of recast time, make it REASONABLE.  I think that a BETTER solution would be to put a smaller heal on the BP.

If a warrior needs another complete heal before the 7.5 minutes is up, maybe the cleric should (*gasp*) actually use MANA to do it!<P>And of course most everybody has ignored the fact that Verant is, because of this change, also redesigning the handful of encounters that were developed wiht the original item stats in mind.<P>Overall, it would be much worse for the game if a single piece of armor became THE item to get, and allowed a group to take on nearly any MOB without fear.

The BP basicly allows one to play in "god mode" to almost any mob.  Not to mention that this item replicates a Paladins "special ability" to a level near unimaginable.<P>Paladins can Lay Hands (for LESS than a complete heal) every 72 minutes.<P>Clerics can *cast* Complete heal several times on one load of mana, which replenishs anywhere from 10 to 20 times during those 72 minutes.<P>Granted, Lay Hands is instant casting, and Complete Heal is 10 seconds, and the BP is 30 seconds - frankly, that doesnt make it any better.<P>I for one am glad that the item is being nerfed, and *STILL* find it absurdly powerful at 7.5 min recast per target.  Three full groups, fully healed in 9 minutes time for zero mana.<P>Cry me a river.

</FONT><HR><BR>*I posted this on one of the other threads but posting it here because it's looking like the other thread may go unread.*<BR>                            <BR>    I think this nerf is really a mistake. First off the donals bp is very rare and very hard to obtain. This nerf is gonna make other bps available to the cleric much better, and these bps are also much easier to get. I mean seriously there are bps out there with more than 40 ac and more wis that are hell of alot easier to get than killing a lvl 65 poison dragon (pretty rare on him too). I really wonder if anyone making these changes have even faced Trakanon. I know there are a couple bps out there that one or two tough groups of 6 could get that would be a better item now than the donals bp after this nerf. That pretty much blows out of the water the idea of risk vs reward.<P>   The new effect on the bp is really a joke. I mean how many times do you think a cleric is gonna cast a 30 second casting time ch on a wiz, chanter, ... ect ect ect? Before you answer remember that the cleric cannot move or cast any other spell during this period. He's a sitting duck and all the group members are in jeapordy. It's either that or sit around for 2 minutes waiting for the bp to heal everyone up. The bp is really gonna only be used once every 7.5 min now. This is totally destroying the item, and the time and effort used to obtain it.<P>    There should be some more creativity used in designing npc encounters. Wow i bet i could design some good monsters by their criteria. Ok he's gonna have 12398598 hp hit for 1478 and ch every 30 seconds! Bam! I'll call him "SuperVelka-snodojo"! It really would be nice to see some randomness in the encounter, or maybe something unique to the AI on these encounters rather than just beefing up hp, melee damage, ect. I think it would rock to run into a tough npc and find out that he ae roots everyone, shadow steps, and blows up the group with nukes. This kind of encounter would be a real challenge. Imagine how a ranger would be kicking tail in this kind of encounter with trueshot! It would be a great alternative to wow he hits for 850 and has a crap load of hp. By adding versatality to these encounters would make it so maybe the classes would be a bit more balanced. Relying on hp and damage output is only one way to make tough mobs, and if all these encounters are so-based it limits the usefullness of some classes. Maybe if we rethink how the unber npcs should be designed we wouldn't have to worry about one item with a complete heal effect or class balance because all encounters wouldn't be a matter of hp and who can take big melee damage!<P>    Last thing, I really don't feel that if some ppl do use their brain in this game that we should punish them. Just because these "Uber" mobs die doesn't mean that one group is overpowered, one item is unbalanced, ect and start waving the nerf stick. It seems like that is done in most cases. I guess it's the easy way out (if all else fails wave the nerf stick!!). Maybe we just need to rethink how to design these encounters.<P>           Thx I do hope you read this,<BR>                    Abinadab<P>  Just a couple of other ideas I've heard ppl talk about-<BR>    In the spawn tables along with having the placeholders ect able to spawn, have the npc to spawn same name same graphic ect but different stats. Have it have a different amount of hp, different spells available to be cast, in some circumstances even a different class all together. This would make some of these encounters more of a surprise and more difficult to prepare for.<P>    If you are worried about a warrior and a cleric out killing turtles and poorly designed npcs that should be out of their reach, do change the npc. If they can kill the npc, then it's an overall sign the npc is underpowered (no this doesn't mean to jack up his hp or make him hit harder). Maybe give the npc just one poison dot spell or something that will do enough damage to kill before the 30 seconds are up. There are probably a handfull of mobs that fall under this category and every time they spawn it's a friggin drama. Like 50 ppl all pop into the zone and everyone is trying to ks it.-Another sign it's underpowered.<P>   Also pls don't post on this thread if you haven't ever used or grouped with someone with this bp. You really have no idea what you are talking about.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Thanks </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think part of the argument that is being missed is this:<P>Rarity has ZERO impact on balance.  ZERO.  ZILCH.  NADA.<P>For one, as Absor pointed out, the longer this game goes the more of everything there is.  This stuff NEVER gets destroyed.  There will eventually be a significant number of these on the servers.  There were already a fair number of CoF's around even before they put them on Ragefire, etc., and who ever thought there'd be a good number of -those-?<P>Two - from what I hear, every single Donal's BP on Rallos Zek, eight of them I believe, are controlled by one guild.  *chuckle*.  I'm sure there's no balance issue there, uh huh.<P>Three - the point of Two is just as applicable to PvE servers.  A guild that controls the majority of these BP's on any server will have a complete and utter STRANGEHOLD on the top mobs of this server, and permanently.   <P>In some ways, the fact that it's rare makes it a WORSE balance issue.  If it were dirt common, well, everyone could use it, and it wouldn't be so illegitimate to base the strength of mobs around this item.  The rarer it is, the more unfair it is to bar anyone but those few with this one single item from gaining access to all the mobs it is required for, and the awesome loot that they drop.<P>Getting a Donal's BP right now basically ensures that you will not get JUST that one uberitem, but also every OTHER uberitem that follows.  I know that you would all like a single-item path to absolute leetness and dominance over your server... but you can't really call that -balanced-, can ya?<P>Qwinn Windfletcher<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>a_yew_tree00,<P>I dont think its necessarily an issue of clerics "complaining" (though some are), I think its more just people upset working so hard to get a Donals BP, and now have to switch to another one.  I'm a cleric (but dont have this BP).  I would be WAY more upset at the fact of the work put into attaining this piece rather than whats happening to it now.  The only thing this nerf prevents is all the other classes abilities to survive after the clerics go oom on an epic encounter (Which usually happens).  Kinda gives you something to think about doesnt it?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Qwinn I don't think anyone is debating that BP needs to be adjusted.  All the posts from guilds who have killed Yelinak, Velketor, Dain, etc. have focused on the other changes that must be made to change the BP.<P>People need to put more effort in worrying about the mobs being looked at and forget about the BP.  They are going to change the BP no matter what.  The mobs getting reduced from quad 800's is a MAYBE at this point.<P>So again the issue is great the bp gets removed.  What are you going to do about all the mob's that were designed based upon this BP.  Because the entire upper end of SOV is based on this BP and tanks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Greetings,<P>My problem with the situation is IF it was such a problem is why did they wait 6 month to fix it. When over 6 months ago when the item was first discovered people already started complaining about it being too powerfull.<P>Seriously, it doesn't take Einstein to figure out how powerfull this item was. It actually shows a total lack of vision. Hell, i still remember reading from Gordon way back when that this item wasn't overpowered and it would stay as is. Too bad boards does not go that far back i would really loved to find that post. <P>Anyways, i don't think anything Verant can do can make up for all the time players that have aquired spent acquiring this item. Too bad the only respecfull thing to do would be to leave the items as is for those that currently owns one and make the new one that drop the new version. But what can you expect, they can't fix bugs that been in the game for over a year, or quest they temporaly nerfed and promised a solution that would be more challenging and would give as much xp (Tonic for Groflah).<P>All i ask, for the love of god before you add new content, add new items or fix class balance. To please fix all the current bugs/problem with the game. Or you'll find yourself in a bad position when other games comes along, you'll go from 300k subscriber to 10k in no time at all.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
