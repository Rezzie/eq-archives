You didn't ask us for our thoughts about the change, you asked for opinions about some trivial portion of it. Yes, trivial, because I won't even bother using the effect on my BP once this change happens, so I COULD CARE LESS IF IT OVERWRITES A FRIGGIN BUFF.

I did not start this thread to gather opinions about this change (with the minor exception of the one question I did ask).  And I did not present my post as such.  I made the post because we think it is important to tell our customers when we are going to make changes that might cause a lot of concern.<P>This is not a half-assed change.  It's the right change.  I'm sorry if the change upsets you, I really am.  But it needs to be done.<P>&gt;"Once again, I ask: FIND A NEW EFFECT FOR THE BP. You CANNOT make CH work on it so that it will be useful--you know, like something I'd want to actually click now and then, as opposed to the rest of my set of Donal's armor--and still preserve your [skewed] sense of balance (balance, like how 6 newbs who can't even do Plane of Fear let alone Trakanon can go to PoG and get a better BP than Donal's?)."&lt;<P>There is no way that I can think of to answer your concern.  There is no effect that we could put on the breastplate that would make it just as nice as it was before.  If it did, it would be just as broken.  I think we have a pretty good sense of balance, but I have no idea how to convince you of that.<P>Alan<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>i thought this was pretty creative with maybe an adjustment to regent used to reflect the effect as they see fit. by far the most creative in that they can limit the effects as much as they want while letting a cleric be more vesatile.. an deciding on the gem would require more stagy and planning (fun) for the cleric. <P>Major kudos to the original poster  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Lonzrick<BR>    Station Member <BR>   posted 01-30-2001 07:59 AM            <P>Of course, they're going to kill the BP anyway. Look at the "options" they gave us when they killed Mark of Karn. They announced they were going to do option A...then polled us as to whether we preferred A or a "newly thoughtof" B. When the majority of the people responded with "Neither A nor B," then went on to provide an even bettersolution.....Verant shoved A at us any.<P>So the CHeal aspect has been taken away.<BR>The monsters should be re-evaluated to compensate for the destruction of the only tool that made it possible to defeat them. However, they won't be re-evaluated. Much like all the other "bad for the player" issues, it will be ignored then forgotten when they perform their next "mega-nerf" on some other item. The monsters will never see a proper balancing.<P>Donal's Breastplate is no longer on my list. I will not be attending Trakannon raids with my guild. I used to go in hopes of acquiring one (even though, after 15 raids, I've still not seen one drop -manarobes nearly every time however- and I've never *SEEN* one worn by another player) Still, I'll not be going, and I suspect a lot of my fellow Clerics will do the same. I hope so. For those of you cheering "nerf Donal's!" ...I hope your clerics stop going. I hope hundreds of Trak raids *don't* happen because there is no Cleric support.<P>However, Verant, there is a way to fix this, turn Donal's into a once-again desired item, make it interesting without being overpowering. Of course, you'd have to use your imaginations a bit...pull your heads out of whatever they're stuck in...and give us something worthwhile, even (gasp) useful.<BR>-----------------------------------------<BR>Change Donal's Breastplate in this manner:<P>It becomes a one-slot container. This container can hold ONE gemstone. The right-click effect would change depending on what gem we put in it.<P>--)&gt; Cat's Eye, Jasper, Peridot - Would result in a Group Symbol of the proper spell.<P>--)&gt; Ruby - Would result in a Complete Heal with no ridiculous 7.5 minute anti-buff. (since Rubies are expensive anyway.)<P>--)&gt; Pearl - Would result in a Complete Heal with the ridiculous 7.5 minute anti-buff<P>--)&gt; Sapphire - Would give us a self-only Clarity II<P>--)&gt; Diamond - Would give us a "res special", and debuff the target. (The idea that by using a crazy expensive component, we could resurrect someone, remove the Res-effects, and Complete Heal them.)<P>--)&gt; Some of the lower cost gems could teleport us to the various Temples. Onyx to Neriak. Bloodstone to<BR>Freeport, etc.<P>--)&gt; Another gem might give us invisibility.<P>----------------------------------------------<P>Something like that would provide us a Breastplate that we would "want" to go after, that would provide a number of lesser useful effects, would add more money-sink possibilities to what you already have in place, would maintain your charade that the totally free CH is unbalancing, and by giving us something unique would somewhat make upfor the way you're currently slapping us around.<P>Lonzrick L'Amore<BR>Xev<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There would be no perceived problem had Verant decided to add a little originality and uniqueness to the Uber encounters of velious. For some odd reason they seem to all be stuck on mass HP mobs that hit for a ton and all need the same basic strategy(mass tanks mass clerics all other clases not required or needed). Why werent these mobs in velious unique enough where vastly different strategys are required? Venril Sathir is a perfect example of a mob that requires a totally unique strategy where clerics are all but useless(If clerics need to heal for this mob, your doing something wrong). If you charge Venril with a basic dragon type attack that is used for Trakanon, you will get obliterated in less than a minute due to his proc lifetap ability stopped only by Chanter Runes. Why wasnt this done to Velious mobs?<P>Examples:<BR>Why couldnt you have changed Yelinak to have a massive DOT that is Only dispelled by Regen(making Druids Ranger Shaman an invaluble tool for this encounter)? <P>Why couldnt you have made Velkator completly immune to melee attacks and Only suceptable to magic based attacks such as weapon procs and nukes? <P>Why is there SO little variety in encounters that the exact same strat(maybe very minor tweaks)is needed? You made the Donals needed thoughout velious and now your making the players pay the price...<P><BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just one question from me. Can clerics still cast heals while it is working? Because if we can still cast our own CH's or Sup heals while it is working, that is not bad. Only suggestion I have is to make the Effect a regen of a complete heal. Not complete heals every 2 minutes...but something like the best regen in the game for that 7.5 minutes. But that will also blow out any previous regen buffs. And keep the 30 sec cast time, because then we could use it before a battle. Something like Healing of the Faithful....or one other idea. Make Donal's BP Diety specific. A Tunare cleric shouldn't be able to use it to heal a CT follower anyways? Wasn't cleric abilities always based on their diety?!?!<BR>Just my opinion<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Im just curious. If you are going to limit it to such a degree, couldnt you put the casting time back to where it was and at least allow them to have a fairly fast heal?<P>I mean reguardless of how fast it casts, they cant do it again for 10 minutes, which is really not too great for your prized item. But bringing the casting time down to where it was before would at least be a little better, and not really unbalancing as they have a long recast delay built in.<P>-L</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I have a level 57 cleric. With the ONLY Donal's BP on the Vallon Zek server.<P>And let me start with saying this, yes I felt the CH with only 20 seconds casting time was a bit to powerful...A BIT. I felt this because I could cast it on one person over and over...<P>I thought of ways to fix this and what you have done thus far is not a fix.<P>I will give a way to fix this at the end, for now I will give my arguement on why what you have done in an attempt to fix the BP is wrong.<P>The BP is junk now. Using it's effect will kill my other group members. Before you say "I disagree", please do not until you have played a cleric and tried to the use that 30 second CH on a group member, and still keep the other group members alive.<P>Not to mention that the stats on the Donal's BP are not much better than the PoH BP (only the AC is better IMO), and the Donal's BP does not even compare to the Chestplate of Stability from the POG, which there are at least 10 of these on Vallon Zek, while I still have the only Donal's BP.<P>Donal's BP <BR>WT 10, 40 AC, +80 Mana,<BR>+12 AGI, +12 DEX, +12 WIS,<BR>EFF: Complete Heal<P>Ethereal Mist<BR>7.5 WT, 28AC, +25 Mana, <BR>+25 HP, +15 STA, +15 WIS<P>Chestplate of Sability<BR>WT 8.0, AC 42, +7 STA, <BR>+13 WIS, +5 INT, +50 HIT<BR>+60 MANA, +2 Fire, +3 Dis,<BR>+3 Cold, +7 Magic, +2 Pois<BR>Effect: Celestial Elixir<P><BR>This is what I see. I really detest soloing in EQ. I am on a PvP server, and I still detest solo pvp, I like to PvP in groups (and I have a level 60 rogue as well, I do not do that much pvp with my cleric =). <P>I love the "vision" of EQ being a group game.Where items are and spells are meant for groups, rather than solo encounters.<P>The Donals BP with a 20 second casting time, was still usable in large groups/raids, and still fit that "vision" of a group game. With 30 second casting time, the use of my Donal's BP in large groups is not really possible and the Donal's BP looses it's "vision" of being used in groups, and becomes an item meant for use in small groups. With two or three people.<P>As it is now, with the 30 second recast time on the Donal's BP, the cleric is only capable of healing one person efficiantly. I can not DARE go into a spell with a 30 second casting time, while I have other members in my group to heal and watch over. If I start into that spell with a 30 second casting time on it, durring a big raid, 99% of the time, my enchanter, rogue, wizard is going to die. <P>You are turning the Donal's BP into an item that is not wanted or used during raids. Never seems to fail, I use my BP, and then I have to use my Sprinkler to res a few people.<P>What I prepose is this, make it so the BP can only be cast on one person every 10 mins or so. I'm not sure how to code this, but set it up like you have Disarm. Where it says, "You are unable to disarm this person at this time". Have it say, "You are unable to heal this person at this time".<P>I suppose you could add a buff to the Donal's BP, that does nothing but ensure that the Donal's healing can not be used on that target again for a set period of time.<P>Make the effect so that it can NOT be removed. Like res effects are. While that buff/effect is up on a target, the Donal's BP CH can not be used on that target again for the set duration.<P>I feel that 5 mins would be a good amount of time for the buff to last.<P>Once you have done this, then reduce the casting time of the Donal's BP back down to the 20 seconds (which is TWICE the casting time of the normal CHing spell). <P>This way, I can use my Donal's BP to CH the tank in my group, then still have time to heal my enchanter that is getting beat on by 4 different mobs with a remedy, and then still use my Donal's BP's CH on the rogue in my group that doesn't know what evade means. Or, I can cast CH (spell) on the tank in my group if he needs it again.<P>As it is, 30 second casting time has made the Donal's BP a "nongroup" item on big raids. Fix it so that I can not use it on the same person over and over, but can use it on different group members in my group if needs be.<P>This will make it so I can actually use the Donal's BP on members of my group and still keep the other members in my group alive by reducing the casting time back down to 20 seconds.<P>Drizzlin the Silent &lt;Silent Souls&gt;<BR>The Assassin of Vallon Zek<P>also have a 57 cleric =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor:<BR>Please consider more options then just nerfing it into utter usefullness. How about putting the same effect as the POG bp with a faster casting time (since it is FAR harder to get). Or scaling the casting time on cheal back to 15 or 20 seconds and -then- adding this buff idea. <P>If you could look past the obvious *uber* guild hater post you would know that some people have worked months and months to get this item. Right now I am wearing a status symbol that I worked hard on getting with: levels, deaths from learning how to kill trak and patience for one of these to drop. After this nerf I will be wearing a bp inferior to one that I have seen people 10 level lower then I get from one week of PoG farming.

</FONT><HR>&lt;Quote from Absor:&gt;<P>And I ask you to step back and really examine the effect that an item like this can have on the entire game. Look at it and try to understand how it would completely change the entire game, and not for the better.<P>&lt;End Absor Quote&gt;<P>I respectfully disagree 100%.  How can you claim that an item, as rare as this one, could ruin the entire game?  What's wrong with having a few ultra-powerful items?  If you want to truly change the game for the better, work around this situation.  Don't punish the clerics that have invested so much time into getting it.  You have already acknowledged that the creation of this item was probably a mistake, yet it somehow made its way into production.  If this were such a glaring error, then why did it take you 6 months to make a final decision.  If I recall, this was already nerfed once.<P>Additionally, if you want to change the game for the better, move outside of the item-box for a little while.  Give EQ a true sense of freshness.  Kunark and Velious are great eye-candy, but for me, they haven't been anything more than copied mobs with higher stats. <P>For example, one of my biggest criticisms of the game is the dullness of the storyline.  I recall in my DM'ing days, one of the best tools I had at my disposal was my ability to tell a story.  EQ at best, has a fragmented story that no one I know seems to understand.  Without going into too much detail here, I will say that your competition has excelled in this area.<P>Let me respond to another issue:<P>&lt;Begin Absor Quote&gt;<BR>I certainly understand your philosophy about only adding and never taking away. And it's the most pleasant route to take. But that route can only lead to disaster. If we never 'nerf' anything, then we have to spend every moment trying to push everything up to meet the standard of the best. If we make one tiny mistake and overpower one item, then we have to spend months (and I do mean months) boosting everything up to meet it. A few years from now we'd probably just have to start people a 50th level with planer gear so that they wouldn't be underpowered…<P>&lt;End Absor Quote&gt;<P>It would seem that we both agree on the "Not Taking Away" issue.  I challenge you therefore to consider working on the environment, rather than taking away from it.  If you do make an "oops", then tune the mobs to react to it.  Work it into the storyline somehow.  Perhaps Donal was an evil arch-enemy of the giants, so whenever this BP is used on any of the giant-bosses, they become buddy-buddies with the cleric.  Considering all you've done so far, would concepts like this be that difficult to implement?   <P>Hopefully, whatever track you take, you will reimburse these clerics that have worked so hard to get this item in some form or fashion.  Considering how many real-life hours this game takes to get anywhere at the higher levels, the current situation just isn't right.<P>For two years I have seen a "Test Server" on my server list.  I don't want to assume anything, but I would imagine that your QA Dept. has folks testing every aspect of the game (as much as possible) on this server.  I would also expect you to create level 60 characters and give them the really sharp stuff, just so they can see these things coming before they hit the Live servers in an expansion.  <P>But if you aren't doing that, then why not?  You would save many a player a lot of grief.<P>Absor, I think you should consider some of these issues.  We could engage in a timeless debate about what is the best road to take and what is good/bad for the game.  However, as a 2-year vet., I'm reaching the end of my road.  The game is very linear in terms of play, and regardless of which class you are, nothing really seems to change, with the exception of a few keystrokes.  <P>This idea is the "end-game"; when the actual gameplay requires very little coherent thought and the substance just isn't there.<P>In closing, I would like to thank you for your response.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Time to get the tractors out and hit PoG and look like every other 50+ cleric on the server.<P>You just dont get it. 30 sec cast time that can be interupted is allready a huge risk. I have to make the choice to risk other party members while healing one. 7.5 min recast on a player time LOL. WHATEVER.<P>Isn't this supposed to be a GAME and are not games supposed to be fun. Why don't you try to put some new fun aspects in it instead of spending your time nerfing HARD EARNED RARE ITEMS. GOD I wish i didnt have 100+ Days of my life invested in a hobby that others can waltz in and change negatively for me. <P>Please stop and try using your time and resources in a way that makes us want to stick around for Star Wars and EQ2. With your history in customer satisfaction I will not be giving you any more revenue for future games. My Household has 3 accts. That will start to add up as people get more frustrated.<P>I havent used this item for twinking, I dont exclusively heal with this item. When I am oom or people just got resed its an item to resort to using. FYI Verant on some large mob encounters I dont even wear it cause I need ressist gear on or I know that in the 30 sec cast time it has on it I will just get intrerupted so why bother. Only dragon I currently wear the BP for is Yelinak cause of the mana drain breath, and let me tell you the zone is laggy enough with 35 killing him and you want us to bring in more clerics? Cause we sure wont have the mana with 6 to 8 to kill him. and the extra clerics we do bring will probably go LD along with some melee. (I have a P700 with 128 megs of Ram on a 768k DSL line so dont try to tell me its my Computer/Connection thats the problem. I am well above your games system/connection requirements)<P>With a 20 second cast time this item was increadible. You nerfed it to 30 sec, we adjusted and I use it far less now. You put this nerf in and i will RARELY use it, just like the rest of the useless effects on my suit of Donals Armour.<P>Guess we should have taken "Your in Our World Now" as a Warning.<P>Varya Valorvixen<BR>56 Templar<BR>Fires of Heaven<BR>Veeshan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The seven and half minute reload time seems a bit steep, but is a good idea in fixing it. But my question is - Why not make it a two minute buff duration or two and a half minute duration? Then your calculating if a monster kill a tank in two and half minutes instead of 30 seconds. Granted I'm not sure which monsters are causing this lack of damage output.. but on major spawns I think in two in a half minutes, one tank would be on the ground. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The problem is that complete heal taunts as much as doing 1pt of damage to the monster.<P>Here's an idea. Why not create a new spell for the bp that does exactly the same effect as complete heal, EXCEPT has an insane taunt value. Simply make it a spell like Divine Healing (+5000 hp's, 30 sec casting time) This will keep the bp's use for non-combat situations but make combat situations risky (you'd be guaranteed a summon by the monster when cast.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I admit I rarely post here, but this is such an ecompassing change that I feel compelled.<P>I play a level 58 rogue on Mithaniel Marr, the home of Afterlife. I, while not being in AL, am in the other power guild on the server. Yes we have Donal BPs and we use them - so I come to you with experience, not rambling ons.<P>You said something to the effect of and in reponse to this:<P>"A DM wouldnt punish players for outsmarting him..."<P>"We're not... etc etc"<P>How can we interpret it as such Absor?  Its not like we found a bug or game exploit, we found a way to creatively use HARD to get items in tactics previously unforseen and it seems like we are being punished for it. This may affect only .05% of the game population, but this is also the die hard EQ players, like myself, who invested alot of time into the game to obtain these items and experience the encounters where they are needed. You are alienating your core EQ players here, the guys who play the most, have several accounts and such. Yes we're eccentric, yes maybe a little odd sometimes - but we enjoy the game... and now, it seems you are taking away from us, the die hards.<P>You said that items become more and more common as the game ages... Well how many casters do you see walking around with Torbin Eyepatches and White DragonScale Cloaks? It's been 2+ years and still these remain fairly rare on most servers, and these are off easily killable dragons for the most part.<P>Now let's take Trakanon. A dragon FAR superior and harder to get to than Nagafen and Vox and compare probabaly his rarest loot drop. This item will never be commonplace. Its been about a year since Kunark came out, and still only .05% of the population has one. In two years, maybe as many as 2-5% of the population may have one. Perhaps more, but then again in that timeframe EQ will be an aging game... <P>It's not only that which makes us think that you are punishing us for using tactics and items in creative ways - it's your timing. This comes right or soon after the conquering of the Velious uber mobs and Zones (ST). It just seems suspicious to alot of the higher end players, honestly is does. It seems that right after we tactically conquered these mobs/zones that you think that we're doing in a way you did not intend and therefore slap us down for it =(<P>I'm not trying to take on an atangonistic tone here, but you are putting yourselves in an advesarial position by saying "This will be nerfed, no input from you the players - it's gonna happen so deal" in essence.<P>You say that no single item(s) should be used to change the output of a fight or encounter, but it's not just the Donal BP if you want to make that comparison. What about the Weapons and Armor and Spells needed to fight these things, should they be nerfed simply because they also are must have items/spells?<P>I'm not sure this post garners a reply, as it simply reitterates what we players have said hundreds of times in just the last 2 days in desperation. But I hope you understand that I feel the way this item is being changed is poor at best and uncalled for at the worst. Please evaluate the Velious encounters in parallel with the Donal Change and don't be hasty with this change. Listen to we, the playerbase when we say things and explain them to you from our perspective. We've been right in the past and shown what we're talking about.<P>Satalia Chai<BR>58 Blackguard<BR>Forsaken Realm<BR>Mithaniel Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Verant, are you listening?<P>As clerics, we don't want this new effect you're proposing on the bp. If I'm not a total gimp, there's no way I'm going to cast cheal on more than 2 people in my group during downtime. <P>I don't know about your groups, but our time between pulls is a lot less than 7.5 minutes. We can squeeze 2 or 3 pulls into 7.5 minutes, and take out 6-10 mobs. One cheal every 2 or 3 pulls, at best.<P>I'm never likely to cast cheal on a chanter, even a freakish one with 4000 hps, not even during downtime (especially not at 30 seconds). I can't afford to leave my chanter at less than 75% health in a fight, so I'm not waiting until after the battle to heal him. I'm almost guaranteed not to cast it on a druid, shaman, wiz, mage, necro or bard, ever. <P>Your post-nerf BP is going to save me about 250 mana every 7.5 minutes. (I can med ~150 mana in the 3 ticks I'm not casting the regular 10 second cheal).<P>These reasons, quite honestly, are enough to make the bp garbage. If this effect was on an item that didn't have nice stats, it would be bank bait. How many clerics carry that gheal staff around for downtime healing? The new Donal's BP is about as useful.<P>Please, if you have any consideration for us clerics, replace the effect with something nice but not unbalanced. <P>Put heroic bond on the bp. Sure, we can use it as a heal, but the long cast time and low amount of hps returned isn't going to let us use it as anything but an emergency combat heal. It'll be a nice downtime heal, and it's a spell we cast all the time. This would take the sting out of you nerfing us every second patch. <P>Take away unbalanced stuff from clerics, fine, I can't argue with that, but please give us something back, something that increases the enjoyment of our class. <P>Aiien.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;This is not a half-assed change. It's the right <BR>&gt;change. I'm sorry if the change upsets you, I <BR>&gt;really am. But it needs to be done.<P>Even if I agreed with the idea that the Donal's BP needs nerfing, I still say they manner in which you are changing it is half-assed.  You did the same thing to MoK, turning it from a spell which I memmed constantly to a spell which is now on page 50 of my spell book.  You seem to punish the people who got some benefit out of these spells and items by rendering them far beyond useless as if that somehow undoes the benefits which we gained while they were powerful.  How about a middle ground here for one?<P><BR>&gt;There is no way that I can think of to answer <BR>&gt;your concern. There is no effect that we could <BR>&gt;put on the breastplate that would make it just as <BR>&gt;nice as it was before. If it did, it would be <BR>&gt;just as broken. I think we have a pretty good <BR>&gt;sense of balance, but I have no idea how to <BR>&gt;convince you of that.<P>No effect?  You must be joking.  You mean to tell me that the only thing you can come up with for this item is to continually nerf it until no one uses it?  I guess that solves the problem from your standpoint, but you'll have to forgive me if I couldn't care less if the "right" solution for you isn't the easy one.  I gave you a perfectly good suggestion, Invisibility.  If it's not broken for WARRIORS to cast this spell, then it certainly wouldn't be broken for clerics.  Other people have suggested Divine Light, if you must keep the "healing" motif on it...provided the casting time isn't ridiculous, that would be ok too, I guess.<P>As for your sense of balance, give me a break.  You just introduced a zone (PoG) where people who can't even break Fear successfully can go to get BPs which are superior in EVERY way [except looks...at least there's one penalty for getting the gimp armor--you get to look like one too, unless you happen to be a DE female] to the ones we get off Trakanon.  Last time I checked, 1 group of people didn't do so well against Trak.<P>That barely scratches the surface of the imbalances in the game.  Risk vs. Reward is screwed up in almost every single zone.<P>But you don't want to hear that... you want to "fix" the easy stuff.  Change the Donal's BP, which would take years to have any significant impact on the game... take the easy route, as usual.<P>--Xy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've actually retired from EQ for a month now, but this issue brought me back, long enough to make this post.<P>I've had a Donal's BP since well before the first nerf, and I have to admit it was overpowered.  However, seeing as a nerf is inevitable, here's a thought on the way it should be nerfed.<P>Back in Fall 2000 when I was level 57, a level 57 monk and I duo'd the efreeti in Sol B.  That's right, DUO.  Certain mobs, like imps in Sol B and most things in Karnor's Castle, are designed to be very easily tauntable as long as people are standing up.  Sit down, however, and they turn on you in a heartbeat.<P>What Donal's BP did for me when I was duo'ing in Sol B and Karnor's is remove the need for me to sit.  I used no mana (and if I did use mana in Sol B I could manastone/click BP it back) and as a result the monk could tank 3 or 4 imps (or dogs/skele's in Karnor's) indefinitely.<P>Now, let me make one thing clear.  The monk and I weren't huddled in the efreeti room camping the efreeti for boots and not pulling spawns (like many raids of 2 or 3 groups do when they go up there).  We pulled ALL (read: every last one of) the imps.  Imagine, 2 people getting duo exp for ~18 spawns every 27-30 minutes.<P>We did this whenever the efreeti was left uncamped for a period of 2 weeks.  We yielded the efreeti spawn itself whenever another group wanted to camp it, and would simply kill all the other imp spawns in the area.  Net result, 3 levels in 2 real weeks (and this includes not starting til 7-8PM each day due to work).<P>Was the BP overpowered then?  Sure it was.  In fact, as we were duoing the efreeti we had conversations with GM's and guides discussing the very problem at hand as they came to watch us.<P>Keep in mind however, the system we had worked would only work in a few zones.  The imps in Sol B and spawns in Karnor's were easy enough to taunt that they could tank 3 or 4 and the mobs would not switch to me while I chain clicked the complete heal.<P>Attempting the same thing in Chardok, The Hole, and other dungeons resulted in the monk and I promptly getting getting our rear ends beaten into the ground as mobs would switch and interrupt the BP effect repeatedly.<P>Extending it to 30 seconds made things like duo'ing the efreeti risky, and in a way fixed the overpowering that Verant was afraid of.  But, since the BP is usable from level 46 onwards, there are many situations at the lower end (and many big mobs at the higher end) where it needed to be addressed.<P>I'm sure we were not the only people using the BP to its full potential.  We may not even have been the ones to first catch the eye of the GM's.  I'm sure there had to be much more than 2 people duoing the efreeti for the nerf to be this drastic.  The point is, the overpowering nature of the BP when seen first hand is obvious.<P>Now, Absor, as far as fixing the BP is concerned.  The compromise, in my view, could go something like this.<P>The BP, before this nerf, was hands down the best item for a cleric (as far as we know, in any case).  It drops off of Trakanon.  Therefore, it has a right to hold such a place.  So, in order to maintain as much as a game balance as possible, the replacement effect needs to keep the BP in the same place on the totem pole, so to speak.  It's unfair to clerics who have Donal's BP who decided not to pursue the new Velious BP's to be suddenly penalized into not having a good BP.<P>Nerfing it to 7.5 minutes is unreasonably long.  Even if you only use it as a downtime reducer between fights, many fights only last a signifigiantly shorter amount of time.<P>At the very least, the buff icon should fade in 5 minutes.  You can debate the pro's and con's of 5 minutes versus 7.5 all you want, but the truth is until the change goes live you can't tell if 7.5 or 5 minutes is balanced or not.  Therefore, why not give the players a break.  If for some odd and unexplained reason 5 minutes is so short it is abused again (although I don't see how), pushing it back to 7.5 could be considered.  <P>You're already ripping the guts out of this item, at least cut us a break in this aspect.<P>Secondly, the BP's effect should in some way be good in such a way that clerics will desire it even if it can only be cast on a person once every 5 minutes.<P>Already, the design of the nerf includes a little of this.  The buff icon will benefit the castee in some way.<P>Let's be honest here, currently, that effect is a cantrip.  For all intents and purposes, it's useless.<P>Now, as I asked myself if there really was a useful buff that was in line with a cleric's abilities.  If it could be made so that the added buff effect worked in harmony with the existing BP effect of complete heal, so much the better.<P>The result of my pondering is this idea:  Have the BP buff icon overwrite res effects.  Yes, I know res effects are there for a reason.  There's a reason warriors cannot cast invis as well.  However, high end items are supposed to remove some of these encumberances.  Cobalt legs give the warriors the ability to cast invis, why not give Cleric BP's the ability to remove res effects?  At least with the Cleric BP the effect would be in line with the class.<P>What is the net result?  The BP is used as a downtime reducer.  The fact that it removes res effects in addition to this allows it to keep it's place as a Good(tm) item.  Therefore, it makes the item good enough where it retains it can at least (arguably) retain its place on the totem pole without being overwhelmingly overpowered.<P>Miriana<BR>Level 60 Cleric/Retired<BR>Legions of Darkness<BR>Innoruuk Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Make it group CH with a 90 sec  cast time. This would make it exactly what was "intended" for the item from what I understand of Alan and Brads post. <P>Would heal the whole party in 90 sec mana free. With the praposed BUFF meathod it would take 180 sec, and they could not use it for another 5.5 min, average fight where this in imbalanced lasts 2 min, so you have to go though 3 fights before you can save time again.<P>Also if this buff is Undispellable Players would use it as a meathod to make it so mob's cant dispell the good buffs on them. so this would cause problems with the same encounters you are trying to fix.<P>Another Idea that came to me last night was change the effect, to Aegolism with no component...with a 45 sec cast time.  This may be another Idea, since this would not save down time directly, but would save prep time by saving the cleric mana, and it isnt a bad heal if they already have the buff on.. it is no CH as it would take 3 casts to get a war to full HP from 1 bub and with the 45 sec cast time he would be dead before this..might wana test this out a bit, but I cant see how this can be a problem. course I am 1 person not 300,000  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Rather than nerf it out of use, make it a situational version of the CH spell.<P>Such as a version that does not work in dungeons.<P>Or does not work at night.<P>Or does not work in the planes.<P>So it retains its use in certain situations. Define those situations away from the mobs you see this as unbalancing.<P>Or simply change the future drops of the item to another effect and stop dropping the current version.  Thus addressing the rare items to common items over time.<P>How about celestial healing with a decent cast time like 8 to 10 seconds.  This has so many restrictions (diseases, poisons, stacking issues, etc) that it should be practical.<P>Fyrestaff</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It will be much better for everyone.

</FONT><HR>I think the majority of high lvl players will agree on this point verant. You seem to think that there is only 5 or so mobs in the game that were designed to be fought and killed using the BP. Only 5?<P>i am sure this is why we do not believe you when you say you do play the game at the high lvl. or that when you guys test this on your own server with everyone connected direct to the server that most bg guild have a lag limit on how many they bring to an encounter. Or that those 5 or so mobs are actually 50 plus. But that doesnt mean anything to you because you do not get what we are trying to say.<P>And as Elderan has pointed out, this wont stop them, slow them abit yes but they will ditch this game when something else comes out and all you have done is hurt the remaining server base in the long run. But thats ok, short sightedness is a core problem in your testing/developement department verant.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I can't convince you not to change this item. You have made up your minds, and sated there is no turning back. But I too, want to emphasize that there are still many bugs in game that you guys for some reason just won't fix. Things that affect our gameplay, but may not affect game balance, so VI does not pay attention to our cries for repair. Remember that list of bugs that you guys asked for 5 months ago? To date, I have yet to see muhc of that worked on. The group bug still exists, 2 years after the game was created. Enchanters still are not creating magical armor and weapons, two years after the package insert on the class stated that was one of our main functions. One and a half years after the spells to create the mana vials was put in game, the first spell only can be used to make Wu's guants, and the second has no use at all. I invaded a brownie camp in lesser fay at great personal risk, to be able to help a tailor make Wu's gaunts <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">. The list of bugs in game can be long, but thats not the point. Refer to the list that you asked us players for, and I won't need to repeat them. My point is, when its in your best interests, you are quick to change. When its in ours, you drag your feet. Thats reality whether you wish to see it or not. <P>Your testing department has been seriously broken for months. Bug reports are never acted upon. Feedbac to bug reports is never given. Reports from test that show new changes introduce bugs are allowed to go live and then we have to endure it til the next "sceduled" patch (reference the bard selos bug that eleimated the drum enhancing effect last month). I don't know if its a lack of manpower, leadership, or both, but something needs to be changed so that problems are identified before a change goes live, or for the rare tiems that is is allowed to go live, they are fixed immediately.<P>Just my 2cp worth, Alan. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My concern and I think I hear is echoed some here is the *way* that these changes come about.  I find it incredible that you casually dismiss the amount of time it took for you to decide that this effect was so overwhelmingly unbalancing. And I still have doubts about your reasoning for it.  I haven't seen swarms of cleric/warrior duos "soloing" spawns and refusing to group with others.  I would like an example of something that has specifically been witnessed by your testers that makes this item such a danger to the game.

If your going to change our bp, then never ever EVER *UNDER ANY EVENT!* make any item that casts stuff for free. According to your terms they are all broken.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor:<P>As a player of the high end game and quite familiar with the uses of the Donal's Breastplate of Mourning in it's current state, I will go out on a limb and challenge the decision to nerf this item outright.<P>1. There are mobs and situations designed with this item specifically in mind as a primary healing device.  Lord Yelinak, Velketor, King Tormax, Tunare, and presumably Fizzlethorpe to name the least.  These are also encounters that require more clerics than melee and casters because of the almost ludicrous nature of these mobs AE effects and their ability to slaughter large numbers of players in an incredibly short period of time.<P>King Tormax, for example, both Flurries and Enrages, but he is coded to so that his melee attacks are an AE Effect.  Without an exceptionally large number of clerics he can kill an UNLIMITED number of player characters well before the time is up on the Breastplate's effect.  Secondly, the Breastplate is useless in this circumstance because he WILL kill any melee class in less than 30 seconds, regardless of level, race, class and equipment.<P>2. The exceptionally long casting time on the object is a hindrance enough for using it.  For the cleric to derive any benefit from this item, as it, there must be a secondary healer in the group to offset the damage caused to anyone but the recipient of the Breastplate's C-Heal.  Right Clicking on the breast plate Locks the Cleric into doing NOTHING for 30 seconds except waiting for the effect to end.  Should the spell effect be interrupted (and it can be), then the Cleric still has a slight chance of having to wait for the effect's casting duration to end before taking any action.<P>3. The proposed change that you have listed is both impractical and will functionally render the item useless.  And when I say useless, I mean totally useless in ALL circumstances.  The majority of tanks have 15 buffs at all times up during raid situations, meaning Celestial Healing and the proposed effect on the Donal's Breastplate DO NOT take effect.  This limiting factor in the use of the Chestplate of Stability will destroy any use for the Donal's Breastplate.  For example, as a Ranger in my regular group, I have the following buffs up at all time:<P>1 Heroic Bond,2 Bulwark of Faith,3 Symbol of Mazrim,4 Bramblecoat,5 Call of Earth,6 Talisman of Kragg,7 Visions of Grandeur,8 Clarity 2,9 Maniacal Strength,10 Delirious Nimble,11 Riotous Health,12 Dexterity,13 Group Resist Magic,14 Strength of Nature and 15 Acumen.<P>Granted you have added buffs such as Aegeolism which frees a buff slot, but that buff slot is immediately filled with a Standard Regenerative Effect.  The stacking issues on Focus of the Spirit and Avatar prevent both from getting much use.  Nevertheless, regardless of what buff combination comes across, your average tank, who benefits the most from the Breastplate's effect, always has 15 buffs up.<P>This means that the new BP effect cannot and will not be used unless buffs are consciously left out of the fold.<P>4. The breastplate is not nearly as unbalancing as you think.  A single Cleric and a Single Warrior will never be able to kill any mob in the game that actually requires the effect of this BP.  They will never be able to challenge more than one Casting Mob at once, and in the majority of situations, a high level casting mob of the experience gain type or an unslowed melee experience mob will outstrip any given Cleric/Warrior pairs ability to effectively and efficiently gain experience, as well as the Breastplate's Ability to heal.  In fact, regardless of class, most warriors won't live 30 seconds versus an unslowed mob at the level most clerics acquire this breastplate.  And since the pair has no method of crowd control, the high aggro factor on the breastplate would get the cleric killed before the warrior could effectively taunt.<P>I am sorry Absor, but your arguments are weak and ill founded in this case and I suggest you leave the breastplate as is.  Verant has tooled the high end game around it in Velious.  Almost every named mob I can think of in the high level dungeons and encounters requires clerics using this breastplate for any chance of success.  So unless you wish to retool an entire expansion and consequently the similarly powered right click items that are dropping off Velketor and Tormax, you should leave the cleric Breastplate alone.  This nerf is UNJUSTIFIED.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor said "I am sorry if this change makes you unhappy about that decision. But the main thing to realize is that no one item should be the sole reason for the existence of any character."<P>I agree.  However, if this is really your position, please review the cleric class AS A WHOLE, and consider why a cleric battles through the first 39 levels to get a group competing against 2 other more versatile (and useful) classes who are just about as good at the job.  The SOLE reason is complete heal, because (at least in the eyes of other classes, and despite it being a situational spell), this is when clerics become "essential" instead of a "poor" druid/shamen.  Believe me, I could do without my buffs (hell I lose money every time I group, even if I am reimbursed), other classes can give near or better buffs (and face it, they will be the same classes that we will need anyway).<P>So, Absor, I challenge you, tell me that one item (complete heal) is not the SOLE reason for creating a cleric in eq.  Please, don't mention rez, its nice, but its only nice because thats the only other thing we have, and because this game punishes death so harshly.  Its actually nice for clerics because it is pretty much the only way to MAKE UP THE LOSS for symbol when grouping.  I hate to charge for rez, and mostly I dont, I rely on what people offer, and I CANNOT afford not to accept.<P>To be frank, I believe Verant rues the day they added CH.  You could have just added a great healing spell, it certainly reduces your choices when it comes to upgrades.  But its all too late for THAT change, because now we have whole continents tuned for it.<P>I'll tell you a not so secret, my first main char of any note was a necro.  I quit the necro and the game because I found the nerfing too much, the stuff to look forward to was reduced, and my playing style was changed every other patch.  I picked cleric in part because it was clearly a class that could not be nerfed, oh how wrong I was.<P>Donals BP?  HAHAHA!  I never expect to get that, I'm sure I never will.  However, if you nerf it, you take away a GOAL, you take away the chance.<BR>For what?  10 people on a server (just how long has that thing been dropping) get to lord it.  Well guess what?  When we level a char to the highest of the high, we want to lord it, isnt that the point?  Sheesh, get to level 60 to be honoured by getting waxed by a green!?<P>If you have a probelem with it, I suggest you limit the LEVEL of char you can cast on, just like you did with the post 50 spells.<P>51 Vicar<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Let me throw some oil on this fire...<P>Delete the BP from the game.<P>Award the clerics that have it some nice BP with great AC and +100 mana + personal regen + some resists (dont forget a little + wisdom like +15).<P>An all around great BP -- not overly unbalancing -- maybe grants another CompleteHeal cast during a battle where the cleric starts at Full mana -- increases ac+resists and minimizes the already non-existant need to heal clerics between battles.<P>Yea you all dropped Trak --- yea the Donals is great but a BP like above would be great too -- (as long as it looks cool).  looking at Donals as a way to deal with SOV lunacy is just wrong -- the BP is just way overpowered -- clerics like wizards are mana restricted in what they can do  -- it sucks but it is life.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First off I find it humorous that so many people who have never been to Veeshan's peak never attempted Velkator, Tormax, Dain, Yelinak, Vindicator and the few other insane mobs seem to think that they have so much knowledge on the subject because some person may or may been able to level a character to 60 faster than another class. For those people I can say get a clue. Let's be honest Trakanon is giant wuss. He at one time was difficult like the first 5 attempts. It took 27 people tonight with one death caused by someone not noticing they were dotted. So he can probably be killed by 18 people. The Bp plays no role in this encounter. The fight is over is less than 45 seconds.  However this isn't the case with these other mobs. I haven't attempted Dain or Yelinak but I've been in efforts on all the rest.<BR>So for Qwinnof Tunare and all the other miscreants  who seethe with their juvenille vittrols as a result of envy please just shut it. I don't want to hear your sob stories about how you were cheated out of a hangman's noose because your cleric couldn't breastplate cheal or how xyz happened and you would have made it if your cleric had a Donal's breastplate. The value of your input is negligible. This has to do with perhaps 100 players out 2500 on a server if that.<P>Making cheal only castable on a player once in 7.5 <BR>minutes is complete foolishiness. Why bother what's the point in even dropping them. You've decided to unravel the fundamentals of the game. Is a warrior not supposed to tank anymore? The usage of the bp was an auxilary heal for when you cleric ran out of mana. No cleric would be caught dead casting this heal against any uber mobs or a series or hard hitting mobs. The cast time is way too long. Your claim about 30 seconds and clerics/warriors is absurd and flawed. If a warrior can stand up to a mob for 30 seconds with out a healer the mob is dead the warrior and cleric have fled or the warrior or cleric are dead. Guess what if i'm a lvl 55+ warrior with say 4500 hps when buffed and I'm tanking a krup knight who doubles for 150 I think the cleric will use a normal cheal before the bp. 30 seconds is way too long to count on before the the heal hits. Even if that works you're leaving no margin for error. Interrupts, extra mobs, lag spikes and so forth. The bp heal is a like an emergency heal it is way too risky to rely on as a normal heal because it is so slow and due to the likelyhood of interrupt. <P>AS for uber mobs the overower claim is even more absurd because every uber mob I have ever faced has some sort of AE or flurry or rampage. All of  these have great chances of interrupting a caster. Not to mention the mobs ability to summon which can further impede a 30 second cheal. <P>The only time this would be overly effective are fight which last longer than say 5 minutes i.e the brownie something or other in PoG which take 35-45 min to kill.<P>However this doesn't meant that there aren't rewards to using the bp in both epic and non-epic fights. They do help before during and after the fights. Their impact is vital but not pronounced.<P>I won't delve into specifics simply I don't want to divulge the guild tactics regarding spefic velious mobs but I will vehemtly underscore the fact that Bp's are not used as primary healers but rather auxiliary heals. <P>For Absor feel free to check out a raid and you will see what the primary uses for Donal's are a) cutting down buffing time and b) tactical approaches to velious uber mobs</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053097-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053097.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053097-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053097-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053097-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053097-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053097&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053097&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
