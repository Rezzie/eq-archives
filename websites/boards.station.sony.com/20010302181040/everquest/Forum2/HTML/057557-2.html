</FONT><HR>My son received this game for Christmas.  I thought it looked interesting so I asked him to let me play.  NO mom you can't, you are not allowed to share.  /BOGGLE<P>What?  Why not?  You are using my internet account to play.  You are using my phone account to play.  You watch T.V. via my cable account.  You get the picture right?<P>But mom, this is different.  What are you talking about son?  We bought the game why can't I play too?  I then remind him I let him play my PS2 games.  Because mom the EULA says.  EULA?  Ok I admit I point and click and that's my limit with computers.  And of course he is playing so I have no idea what he is talking about, and his father the computer geek isn't home. <P>So I e-mailed the powers that be...and find out I can't play!  ERRR.  I still do not understand this, I can have 8 characters on a zillion servers, but only 1 person can play all those characters?<P>So I spend the next couple of days "sharing" with my son, no he wouldn't let me actually play, or even make a character.  I got to do all the researching on the internet, and the typing of /ooc /group /loc etc. so he could fight, walk, etc.  <P>I couldn't stand it anymore!  I went out and bought myself another copy.  Then my husband couldn't stand it anymore and went out and bought ANOTHER copy!<P>Now we have 3 accounts on the network.  But I still wish we didn't have to.  <P>I would prefer a simplier way to allow members to share an account.  I would think individual passwords for the characters would be a better way to allow sharing of accounts.  They could charge a "family plan" price that would allow x numbers of users per account with individual charater passwords. That would help with "I let my brother use my account and he sold/destroyed/lost whatever and I want it back!" or whatever problems they have run into with "shared" accounts.<P>Just my thoughts anyway.....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

You think Best Buy is going to stop carrying Interplay games because Outpost.com sells them too over the internet? Or because you can pre-order them (I pre-ordered BG2 direct from Interplay)? That is ridiculous. If it sells, your supply chain will sell it, period. Simple supply/demand.<P>Besides, we aren't asking for ALL sales to occur on the internet, we are asking to be able to have a "family plan". A reward to loyal customers with more than one player in the house. Retailer X still gets that first box sale.<P>Oh, that and we are asking for a response from Absor on a reasonable, intelligent post. *gasp* </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have heard somewhere that there are now 350,000 accounts in EQ.  Lets to the math...<P>First, lets be conservative and reduce that number to 250,000.  Let's also assume that the company makes $10 per package sold.  So right there, $2.5 million dollars to cover the cost of development.  <P>Now, consider the $10 per month they get from the 250,000.  That's $2.5 million dollars A MONTH or $30 million a year to run the operation.<P>Either there is some serious money being made or some middlemen are raking it in.<P>I would have to say, if the number of active accounts is true, EQ has got to be doing okay for Verant and Sony.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Buy another copy of the game and have the character moved to that account.  It's been done in the past, especially for parents sharing the account with their kids.

</FONT><HR>I am one of 7 children...(the oldest at age 26).<P>The 5 boys all play EQ.<P>I have 2 accounts for myself (I don't live at my dad's)<BR>My twin brother has an account(he doesn't live at my dads)<BR>I bought an account for the other 3 brothers to try....they liked it. They had one machine so 1 account was perfect and brothers and sisters seemed to be within EULA so long as they were sharing a machine.<P>Now Me and the twin got a 2nd machine going for them and a 2nd account. But noone will play on it because they all have 50+ on the other account.<P>Our problem is not the willingness to have a box per machine, or to even an account per person at this point...it;s the fact they don't want to start over so in other words verant is ENCOURAGING us to NOT buy another copy.<P>I mean I'd gladly pay for a 3rd copy now and be perfectly legit by any standard (I beleive brothers in the same house is legit, but this would be even more so.) The only problem is if I buy the 3rd account it will be as unused as the 2nd account and they will still all fight over the 1st account.<P>I understand it's because of eBay...but it's causing some legit problems.<P>As for twinking and PL....<BR>How would allowing you to pay for a full acct to spin off a character encourage twinking a new character up over buying a whole new account? It's the SAME RESULT. I don't see your argument.<P>Our discussion is moving 2 pre-established characters or increasing the cost so we can play both and have it be in-line with buying from scratch.<P>I don't care if they charge me $50 activation of a second access point and $10/mo mantenance and insist it all be on the same bill.<P>Thier current stance leans me towards cancelling account #2. If they change thier stance I'll buy account #3. Thus giving them $50 +$20 a month more over thier current stance.<P>Oh BTW we got 5 accounts and 5 people play..it's just I have 2 accts and my little brothers refuse to use one. I'd say it's legal, it's just sucking big time because we can't play TOGETHER.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The expansions SHOULD be free, since they are just extensions of the regular game, and there should be a single player mode since you are requireing that someone with a credit card only can play the normal game. You can't even play the first "free" month w/o a CC card. The monthly fees cover server upgrades and whatnot, including game development. Make this game free and you get LOTS of new customers paying for a service, more revenue stemmed from less greed. <P><BR>Ich, I ramble and become less...something or another...when I don't...hmm.....zzzzzz</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Of course you can be banned for admitting this. Hey, they can ban you for anything really. Its an at-will agreement. Generally speaking banning customers is bad for business. But maybe if Verant understands the "why" of this supposed violation, they can see past their legalese and set up some customer friendly, revenue enhancing policies.<P>Come on, we are appealing to your greed here Verant, truly you can recognize this! You have no magic resistance to the greed spell!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well Ive been reading the above concerns/problems/frustrations. You must consider this. Say they made it so 2 or more people could play on the same account. People could very easy call up a friend tell them the account info and both people one being a paying customer and the other not playing EQ .<P>This IMO is one of verants concerns. Hehe im sure this same scenario is being played out on many other online games. Ya gotta look at the whole picture not just what is convenient to your situation.<P> Because when you look at the big picture, there are a number of things that have to be put into consideration. Its easyer to control and moderate accounts that have 1 user/account. Say your roomate/brother/significant other/ whatever decides they want to break some rule and get the account banned, now your going to be in a bind cause now ur banned cause of somthing somone else on you account did. And there would be no way for u to get unbanned because for all they know u could be the same person making up some story that "no it wasnt me it was my (whoever)"...lol . <P>OK ive said enuf :P<P>Ganelin Lamagra<BR>The Seventh Hammer Server<BR>51 Heretic & Loyal Minion of Bertoxxulous</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Gebriel,<P>You bring up some good points. The first point can be controlled by using IP addresses to a degree. Or it could be controlled with an unlocking key that would be downloaded. Lots of ways to technologically control this.<P>Your second point could be controlled as well very easily. Family accounts would have a master account. Subsidiary account bannings would be referred to the master account. If abuse continues, then the master account gets banned.<P>Easily handled with a little creativity  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057557-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057557.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057557&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057557&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
