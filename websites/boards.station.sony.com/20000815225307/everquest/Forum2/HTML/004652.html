</FONT><HR>So two of my guildmates are working the aviak two-spawn in Lake Rathetear, with the situation well in hand. Along comes a guy and asks "let me have one of these spawns...i deserve it."<P>In guildchat, my fellows ask what to do...i promptly ask them "who was there first"...they replied that they were (of course <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">..i told them "if you feel like being generous, give him a spawn, if ya dont, dont sweat it, its two of you and two aviaks....you own the site"<P>Weeeeeelllll....<P>Next day one of my fellows sends me a tell. Seems the othe guy not only got one of his guildmates involved (this is a totally diferent topic, and btw, who cares about higher levs KSing for thier guildies? <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> but got 2 GM's involved. Thats right, a full blown conflagaration over 2 freaking aviaks.<P>Long story short: my fellows were told to share the spawn, that camping the two birds was not abiding by the play nice policies.<P>LOLOL....play nice? Communism isnt my idea of play nice. I cant wait for a large guild to camp some high level area only to be forced into playing nice and letting an even larger or more powerful guild "share the spawn"....<P>Most players walk into a spawn and see its camped, ask how long the camper or group is going to be there, or ask to get on a list. To tell a group you DESERVE their camp is ludicrous, and to have a policy enforcing that insanity is, well....i dont think there is a word for it.<P>When will the never-ending duplicity of VI's policy changes cease and desist?<P>BTW, this maybe shoulda been on the rants board, but perhaps GW will come down and answer this mere mortal....why why why do you create rules that are detrimental to the players? Play nice started off as a way to prevent KSing and verbal abuse. Play nice should not be exploited as a means of allowing everyone the same chance at a spot in line for toilet paper...err...getting xp. The report command is functional (verbal abusers) and the petition command is in place for KSing...we're supposed to have gotten larger GM staffing...what gives? Take this communistic "play nice" thing out please. I'd hate to see Uber Guild #1 piss off Uber Guild #2 by demanding a shot at some Uber Mob i have yet to solo  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Sincerely,<BR>Gerzan Llewllyn<BR>Master of the 42nd Whole Note<BR>Bertoxxulous<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well when I play one of my twinks and its crowded I ask if I can share. Many times they will group with me or say "I will just take 2 or 3 more and its yours" which I reply "ok thanx" sit there and chat with friends or somethin. <BR>On the occasion someone says flat out NO, I just tell them what I think of thier greedy, childish asses and move on (I once invoked PvP but I dont want it done to me so I dont anymore)<BR>In short, Its really not worth the trouble and you should just split the spawn, but if some tard tries to make you give up something and they are being dichs, then I am not against making life difficult for them. <BR>This doesnt happen at high levels often as reputation means a whole lot on top of the fact that you know most people around you by then also.<P>Andaericus<BR>55 Luminary<BR>Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Unfortunately the play nice "share" rules designed to fix rare spawn camps have become a means by which people drive others off from exp (non-uberloot) camps.<P>Here's the concept:  A group is camping something that's about right in challenge/exp for their group.  Someone comes along & insists to share.  Exp is cut in half.  Everyone gets bored.  Original group leaves and invaders get the whole camp to themselves now.<P>I refuse to do this sort of thing personally, if someone is at the camp when I get there, I ask if they want help, how long they will be, and then go somewhere else if I'm not prepared to wait or not interested in joining.  <P>And things like the Priest of Najena...55 minute spawn with a 95% placeholder...who do you think is willing to "share" that?  1 kill an hour?  It's obviously not a "farmed" item because it is lore no-drop.  But people keep showing up and expecting to share the chance of getting the key, even though some poor schmuck has been at it for 24 hours straight trying to get the damn thing (yes, that was me  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> )<P>Vivid Dreamings, 32nd Enchantress Hand of Mana Officer, Craftsmistress and Linguist on Nameless<BR>Tylendell Ashkevron, 31st Druid<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I simply asked a question...why the condition exists and a need for play nice policies are in effect when we in fact have means at our disposal which eliminate the need for it. However, if i were to make an assessment of players like you...well, then i'd be just like ya now wouldn't I  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>&gt;&gt;It was this attitude that was destroying parts of the game and play nice has rectified it by forcing greedy powercampers to allow other players a shot. <P>So greedy powercamperguild vs greedy powercamperguild cant exist? Its not theoretical? Theoretically, it does exist with the play nice rules. Without the play nice rules, it would not exist, and we would have the 24-7 camper situation you mentioned. Only, we have it anyway, because as one poster put it most simply ask if the spawn is camped and leave if it is. Fair? No. Right? Yes. <P>If newcomer to the spot wants to KS the spot, or train the spot, or verbally abuse the spot, the person at the spot originally has the option to use the 2 tools we have in place to stop the activites.<P>BTW, i did mention that i talked with a GM the next day about it and got a clarification?

</FONT><HR>PnP policy is abused more then it helps. I personally don't use them to give me an advantage, and I don't shove my way into a spawn. I think that's just really low. These are people who are too friggin lazy to go somewhere else, and have nothing better to do with their time then harass other players.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/mad.gif"><P>Here is how I handle a situation where someone has a spawn and I also want it. This happened this part weekend.<P>I zone into unrest and there areo nly about 6 people there. I ask if anyone is camping the ghost, since I just wanted 2 jagged bands then I was outta there. I get a reply saying he's camped. So, I send a tell to this player, asking if he would mind if I join his group. I explain that all I wanted was 2 rings, and boots were his if they dropped. He offered to sell me 2 rings instead. I told him I really wasn't interested in buying the rings, but I didn't mind joining him if he was ok with that. He said for me to just have the spawn. I asked if he was sure, and he said, "Yeah, I'll just camp the hallway instead." I told him that once I was done, he can have it back and thanked him. He simply said, "whatever." I told him I wasn't chasing him off, and he didn't have to do this. He didn't seem to care much for my offerings. Well, first ghost that pops has the boots. My lucky day!<P>What did I do? I sent him a tell, asking him to come over to me. When he showed up, I gave him the boots. I didn't have to do that, but I respected the fact that he was there first, and had been there a while. He gave me the camp since he didn't want to be threatened into being forced to give it cause of PnP. He was VERY happy and QUITE suprised at the fact I gave him the boots. He gave me the 2 rings I was there for, and we both left happy. We also talked for a while afterwords. Everyone got what they wanted.<P>I'd rather do things in a civil manner, and polite instead of using some quick fix policy to get my way.<P>--Cy</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The problem I have with this issue of PnP is with very, very long camps for specific items. Take the AC in OOT, you could be at that for 10 hours, some guy shows up and wants to alternate kills. You say no and he petitions, a GM shows up and enforces it.

</FONT><HR>Cyranith (and to those who say PNP wouldn't be needed with people like him/her):  While what you did was extremely nice and highly commendable, I fail to see that it has anything to do with the PnP.  The person wasn't trying to hold on to the spawn.  THAT person played nice.  You did too, but that was really pretty much unnecessary, it was after the fact.<P>Look.  I have waited for DAYS to get a shot at fangs in Mistmoore.  During those DAYS, they were camped by level 50 wizards and necros.  Every 10 hours or so, I'd see them start to auction again (trading butler fang for xxx).  It was impossible to get in there.  It was being overwhelmingly farmed.  Oh, by the way, one of them was a known ebayer too - guess she was trying to trade for more items to sell on Ebay.  That was backed up by the fact that these people all disappeared the day the new anti-Ebay EULA went into effect.<P>That was my one use of the PnP, and it was absolutely, completely justified.  To blacklist anyone who has been known to use PnP is to basically say that camp farming does not exist and there is no good use for it.  IMO, that is simply way wrong.<P>Qwinn Windfletcher<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Look, before PnP, EQ had gotten to the point where people began to think that once they got to a spawn first they "owned it".  I think much of that attitude still permeates today, which is why Verant had to issue the PnP policies.  Back in the good old days (over a year ago) people would allow anyone who walked up to a spawn to rotate in.  There was generally no need for GM's to moderate anything.  Unfortunately this system slowly deteriorated with the farming, uberguilds, twinkers, and powerlevelers to the point where people thought they owned camps.  In fact, you could have logged in to Lake Rathe and seen a dozen ooc shouts saying:  "Is xyz camped", "Yes, xyz is camped."  Which was basically totally bs, and meant, yeah, it's our camp, go away.  So Verant finally responded with PnP rules, which have come way too late to change the attitudes of the thousands of powercampers on the servers who think that first come means forever served.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>PnP is for the weak, rude, and impatient.  Anyone who thinks it was necessary was a newbie who didn't know anything about the game at the time it was implemented.  anyone who thinks EQ is any better now because of PnP was a newbie when it was implemented.  PnP has done nothing but waste gm time, and make people bitter towards eachother.  It has driven the server communities apart in a way.  Why?  Think of it this way (and before you say, "but you don't OWN the spawn," read it fully, because it's relevant).  <P>Say you have a box of milk duds.  Got the milk duds?  good.  okay.  Now pretend you're walking along and you see little Danny. Little Danny has no milk duds, so you have the choice to either share with him, or not to share with him.  If you share with him, it's out of your own good will, and you will not resent him for it.  However, if he asks you for your milk duds, and you say, "no," then you obviously don't want to share your milk duds with li'l Danny.  So, most likely, you don't share with him...but what if Danny keeps on whining, and makes a lotta noise? Now you may have a problem.  So of course he sees your mom and goes crying to her saying that you won't share.  And of course your mom makes you share your milk duds, but instead of doing it out of kindness and willingness to share, you are forced to do it.  Who are you gonna resent?  That's right, you will resent mom, and Danny.  You'll get over mom, and won't worry about her in a few minutes, but you'll think Danny is a twerp for a long time.<P>Now I know you don't own a spawn, but think of it this way please:  If you force something on someone instead of being the bigger person and dropping it, they will resent you, and probably won't help you in the future if you ever need it.  If that's not enough, it makes you look whiney and childish.  It's not that hard to just let someone have a spawn and wait your turn.  We have to wait our turns all our lives in many things.  Whether you're on the bench in baseball and hoping that the coach will let you bat, or on the soccer team, wishing you were on the field, you won't get anywhere by whining and having mommy and daddy look over you (unless mommy and daddy are rich...sport politics suck). <P>This is the same idea...the gm's are your mom's and dad's, and the person enforcing PnP is little Danny.  It matters not if you own a spawn, but if you're there first, and have broken the spawn, people should be grown up enough to leave well enough alone and not make themselves look like jackasses.  Of course, if they do whine and call gm's, they also make a potentially good time for someone else and turn it to crap.<P>But then again, if you wanna share, by all means share...but you shouldn't have to feel like it's your duty to share everything.<P>If someone ever asks me to share a spot, I do...but I don't expect everyone else to follow my lead, nor will I try to force them to.<P>I hope people can see that the person who needs the most growing up is the one who tries to enforce this policy<P>bye bye</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I'm not a newbie, or a child, and I can tell you that the whole attitude of "this is my camp, go away" had gotten RIDICULOUS before pnp was implemented.  People just took over in a way that forced Verant to implement some kind of policy, however inadequate to deal with it.  I had long arguments with people prior to pnp who honestly felt that if they had a camp staked it it was THEIRS, and they didn't have to share it.  Well, Verant pretty much backed up my side of the argument with a big I DON'T THINK SO to all the powercampers.  You don't own anything in this game, especially spawn sites.  If you can't find a way to rotate people in immediately then you don't need to play a multiplayer game.  There shouldn't have to be any begging, or bickering over camps.  If someone shows up they have just as much right to get into the rotation as the people sitting there.

</FONT><HR>No, PnP doesn't make people upset, Jerks make people upset. Yes, people are using the PnP to squeeze into broken camps. But, the PnP rules were really needed for some very crowded servers.<P>There is no doubt that some people are being jerks about it, but people grabbing spawns and monopolizing them have caused it. It is us the players that are responsible for the PnP. We caused the situation, we complained about the situation, and this is the only situation that we (sorta) will tolerate.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I want to point out was the common occurences that PNP allows, that simply is abusing the policy to your advantage.  Here is what happened to one of my groups this last weekend.<P>My guild decides that we want to Hunt the Froglok King in Liveside, LGUK.  WE're preparing for a naggy raid, and need some more crowns.<P>We have a full group of level 40-51.  We have no cleric, so if one of us dies, they have to make their way back to the King "the hard way".<P>Ok..After a very rigorous struggle, involving 2 deaths, backtracking back through the minotaur mess to retrive them, and trying to keep the King/Gargoyle/Water Ele and adajacent rooms broke to allow free travel, we finally get all 6 guys in the king room, with the room well broken.<P>About this time, two level 52 casters, one a mage, the other a necro, come into the room.  They EACH demand a fair turn at the King Spawn.  We tell them that when we're finished, they are welcome to it.  Of course, the DEMAND that they each get their share.  This would leave my full group of 6, with one in 3 King spawns.  I told them, "no way".  So guess what, they invoke PNP, call a GM who was there in minutes, and the GM forces my full group to share with EACH of them.  Wonderful, so my full group gets 1 in 3 king spawns, and they get one each.  What a load.<P>Ok.  We have to do it.  So my group takes it's spawn when it comes, and then proceeds to take the Boks and other spawns in the room also.  The next spawns is the Necro's.  Well, the King pops and we back off.  So the necro is fighting the King with his pet, and woah, here comes the Tactician.  The Tactician attacks the Necro and my group just watches.  Afterall, my group has to handle these multiple spawns, so should the necro when it's his turn I guess.  Well, the Mage jumps in to help the necro, but the necro takes some quick damage, and dies.<P>I get all sorts of profanity and rude comments from the Necro for allowing him to lose XP and not helping him.  Next thing I know, here's the GM.  The GM tells my group now that we MUST leave, since we didn't help the Necro and he lost XP.<P>In other words, the Necro and Mage could NOT break the spawn, they couldn't even hold it singlely.  They just wanted to reap the rewards of a broken spawn, and when we didn't help them, we were ORDERED to leave the spawn by the GM.<P>You ask me if PNP is broke.  Yes, there is no doubt in my that it is.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>LOL, funny. if you said that because of the camp is only a 2 spawn camp that the guy shouldnt "deserve" it, then you should ask your guildmate to share it coz "it is only a 2 spawn camp" no big deal.<P>why didnt you do so and still complain about it? if you think this shouldnt get 2 GM to involve, then at the first part, you should let your guildmate share first.<P>share!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004652-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004652-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004652-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004652&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004652&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
