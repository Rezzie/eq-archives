</FONT><HR>This blows I have been playing on the Erollosi Marr Sever since January. My friend had started playing last June. Way back in September my friend bought his Langseax of the Wolves for 900pp, I bought my in early March for about 650pp. Some people are now selling them for like 350pp and its all because of TWINKS!!!! I hate Twinks I go around thinking I am all bad because I am a level 25 Warrior with my Hardcore armor and weapons. Then I see this little punk 13 Warrior packing like full Crafted and a Mith 2hander. I mean come yeah i can see like some FS, some Bronze, maybe like a SBH, and stuff like that but when you see people twinking like that it kinda of ruins the game for you. The other day my friend had to duel this level 30 Druid and him being a level 30 Warrior we though this would be cool. Of course when we saw her she was twinked to high hell. Then since my friend packs Executioner's Axe they started calling him and twink and he isn't what so ever. Anyways back on with the duel.....He whooped the Druids ass because she wouldnt fight him because he resisted everythingshe casted. She ran around the zone for a frickin hour. Anyways how are people who have a mid level or even a high level character supposed to make money if people just keep twinking. It brings down the amount of people who want to buy it and then people who are trying to sell just lower their price to sell it. I dont sell Bronze i get from Unrest any more i just sell it to a merchant. Well anyways if your a twink you suck and if your not your cool.

</FONT><HR>yo yo, hatebreedian, your awesome bro.  Anyways, yeah i whooped that 30 druid!  haha she only had me down a bub i resister snare at LEAST 7 times and she just kept runnin around East commons for an hour callin me a cheater and twink and everything else, but she just couldnt deal with the fact that a warrior could be so powerful, she was talkin crap about em before the fight, THATS why i challenged her.  and i whooped her all along the commons zone.  and the day before that i whooped a 29 mage WITH pet, pet did total of like 10 damage, i just TORE the mage apart with my claws and BBK and kicking, he barely got a spell off, and he would try to root me (which i resisted) but one time i pretended i was rooted so he started casting, i busted out my exe axe run over to him while hes casting and double hit for 61 then 51, the kid dropped like a rock. he then said he would zone and i said ok since he was cool so i just killed hit pet real quick before he zoned with like 20hp left.  oh yeah, its great bein a warrior. oh and about twinking, it sucks dont do it, it takes the fun out of the game for YOU, you dont get teh satisfaction of earning something on your own.  well yeah so dont do it. <BR>peace<P>Timchoffet Darkinn<BR>30 half elf warrior<BR>erollisi marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

If your a twink you should delete that character because i hate seeing little lvl 5 in full crafted and having an exe axe.  it takes the fun out of the game and also doesnt give the satisfaction of earning anything with that char.

</FONT><HR>Plane Gear could have been passed one of two ways, but both are now fixed. One: Kill character, delete, make new with same name, and loot that corpse. Or Two, something bout it being in a bag and it was tradeable? Rumor I heard, they fixed it now though. And as for the whole being pissed at tweaks? Pretend it is real, all of Norrath is a real world. No levels, just abilities and learned skills. You see someone who looks about the same skill as you wearing full plate, and you have this cheap old banded? You started with nothing. He came from a rich House, with spoiling parents. Or the Guild he is in saw his potential, and gave him gifts to aid in it. So just use imagination and shuddap about tweaks. Besides, they most likely earned all that equip on another character, and thus did work up from the bottom, and want an easy ride the second time round. Can you blame them? I am gonna tweak myself a second character when i get fifty. As for the player economy, it is supposed to be that way. A new server's prices are incredible! I have seen a BBC for 500 pp, and then on Bristlebane for 25! As more players earn the items, and more players go into the level that gets nifty stuff, it becomes more common, thus less expensive. So just shuddap about this nonsense and complain about something that is a REAL problem. Like melee classes inability to solo greens at 50 (PS. I am not a tweak, do not even accept AWESOME stuff from my guilds as I stand on the principal of earning all I wear.)<P>        <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif"> Peace  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>What on earth does twinking have to do with corruption?<P>Corruption is like preferential treatment of some players by GM's or the unauthorized granting of items by GM's, improperly executed exp resses by guids etc.<P>Twinking is someone who busted ass with another character giving himself an easier time in playing another character because they want variety and want to have fun.  <P>The ONLY problem with twinks and powerlevelling is that they can be very inconsiderate of people starting out from the bottom up with nothing and kill a disproportionate amount of exp bearing creatures.  This is balanced out some by the fact that they rarely if ever loot those creatures and a newbie can loot those bodies.  Same goes for guard killing.  You may die because someone killed the guards, but then again, you probably have a FS weapon or two because someone killed the guards.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I played on Emarr from the day it opened until November and LoW's never went for more than 800 when I was on and were down to about 400 when I left.  Don't know why you would pay 900PP for something worth less than 400PP.  <P>Regardless consider the average level 45+ player.  They are in a reasonable size guild and one day they all get together and go do the King room in Lower Guk to get crowns for dragon runs (+20 resist fire/cold).  Since everyone in the guild who can use one has a Mithril 2-hander already when those drop (about a 50/50 crown/2hander ratio) they random them.  The warriors can't even take part since the Mith is lore.  So in a 10 hour camping session all 6 of the 10 people there that didn't already have Mith's get one.  <P>So what are these 6 people supposed to do with them since they are all casters?  They can trade for stuff, but they already have everything they need more or less.  After looking around for something to do with it they finally decide to give it to either a friend, their wife/GF, or their own twink.  No matter what they do with it suddenly a level 15 character has an ultra-nice 2hander.  Given that the thing had NO chance of making it's way to you why do you care?<P>What I really don't understand is how anyone can be upset that prices fluctuate.  I bought some stock when the market was high in May of last year.  Since then the stock had dropped to about 60% of its value at that time.  Do I Bi+ch & Moan because someone else is now buying that stock for less than I did?  Nope.. I just suck it up and deal with it.  <P>Twinking and money sinks are the only thing saving the economy.  If they Froglock king were camped 24/7 for crowns/miths about 10 miths would drop per day.  If these all entered the economy directly instead of going to twinks and guildmates then within 2 months every regularly played warrior/SK/PAL on the server would have one and your LoW would be worth about 5PP because nobody would be interested in owning one at all.  <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>guess what? SSoY used to go for about 15k on xegony, but now that everyone has one, and dragon/planar gear is getting more familiar (plus the ssoy is still camped) the price has fallen to about half of what it was. this is from flooding the market, not twinking, the paw gloves were going for 2k plat when the new paw was opened, but now they auction for about 200 pp. this is not because of twinking, this is because of flooding the market. <P>you look at someone and think about how awful it is that they can have all this neat stuff, well guess what they camped for it, they earned it, you didn't. pay the price or whine. so anyway, twinks are a newbies best friend. who loots when a twink is in the group? cirtainly not the twink, he could care less about 1gp or 7sp. I group with twinks constantly and have a full set of crafted, a bladed claw and a bbk, and 450pp in the bank at 25, traded and worked for it all myself. Please don't assume that because you are lasy people should give things to you, or that you deserve as much as everyone else.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>This is basic economics. Supply and demand.<P>Demand price fluctuates because supply fluctuates.<P>Still with me?<P>As a server gets older, more items of a given type are looted and sent into the general trade arena. Even if half of those are never traded again, that's still ALOT of items.<P>Now. Are you telling me that you (Hatebreedian) have NO intention of EVER camping an item purely for the purpose of selling it, and thereby driving the price down yourself? That you will NEVER random for an item you cannot use yourself?<P>If you say yes, you are flat out lying. Because you offered to sell me a dragoon dirk about two weeks ago. <P>Prices will change, almost always going down, like your LoW. As you rise in level, what you think is valuable becomes garbage. What you think is hot sh*t today is a hohum twink item tomorrow.<P>According to your rant, we should neither twink with these items, nor sell them. Sure thing, bubba. Long as you practice what you preach.<P>The benefit to you:<P>More items means lower prices. Your equipment will be cheaper because of it. As a warrior, your equipment is vital.
