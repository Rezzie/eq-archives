</FONT><HR>just a quick note...<BR>how many of you paladins out there have been noticing degradation in their melee ability past 51st level ?<BR>i am currently 53rd level on 7th hammer, trying to fight mobs (with a group) over in velious.<BR>now i have watched my damage output and combat ability for a few days now, and this is what i have come up with..<BR>(i'm no number cruncher so bear with me)<P>i keep on hand 3 weapons, my darkmetal holy water sprinkler, my GhoulBane, and SoulFire.<BR>with flowing black silk sash<BR>skills<BR>strength 147<BR>dexterity 117 <BR>Stamina 110<BR>(209) for 2h slash<BR>(207) for 1h blunt<BR>(204) for 1h slash<BR>(approximations)<BR>i find... with my soulfire, i miss approxiamtely 35% of the time during a fight.. averaging 40pts a hit, max 107(watched this many mnay a times)<BR>with my sprinkler, i miss approximately 25% of the time, and average 50 pts a hit, max 85<BR>ghoulbane, miss about the same as my soulfire<BR>hit for 45-50 pts average, max 72.<BR>now i know we paladins cannot solo even a low blue mob for XP, i find it even hard to solo a green mob, (eg: zol ghoul knight in lower guk, green and cannot solo them)<BR>we paladins are lacking in combat skills, we are mainly tanks, yet we do not hit as much, do not absorb damage as much, and i have found finding groups 50+ is not as easy as it was back in the 35th level days. no one needs paladins in their groups at 50+, monks, warriors, druids, they have it all now. at least one thing that changed was our melee ability AFTER casting a spell, we do not have that delay anymore.. so its 'almost' better to cast spells DURING a fight. but, with the spells we paladins have, we wont be casting spells during a fight anyways, we are mainly tanks. with poor healing abilities for after battles, greater healing was great back in the day, but now with everyone getti higher levels, more hitpoints, more hitpoint buffs, our healing ability is useless now, and to wait until 57 for superior healing ? well by the time we get superior healing at that level, it wont matter, the amount of hitpoints to heal at those levels isnt going to be anymore worth it than what greater healing is now.<BR>i have over 2200 hitpoints with self buffs as it is.. greater healing will heal about HALF a bubble of life with greater healing. we cant even heal ourselves during combat. we have choices yes... root the mob, back off and either RUN away, or heal and continue the fight, but to heal someone with full self buffs, and then continue into a battle... we would be out of mana after the first time we backed off.<P>suggestions....<BR>1) make our paladin melee skills a bit higher for 50+ characters<BR>being only a single weapon class (one weapon at a time) we will still never surpass a monk or a warrior in melee)<P>2) give us our next healing spell (superior healing) at level 54, and then another healing spell at 58 or 59 (not complete heal, thats for clerics) to compensate for everyones extra hitpoints at such higher levels<P>3) taunting, still doesnt work well, even with the extra skill, i sometimes go 4-6 refreshes of my taunt button before a mob will turn on me, and then turn for only 0.5 of a second, not even enough for the mob to take a strike at me<P>these will not help for a solo situation, but will greatly improve the 'group' situation and helpfull abilities that a paladin 'could' bring<P>paladin the main tank in your wizard party ? dont even think about it<BR>paladin main healer in a  group situation ? not a chance<BR>even 2 paladins in a group as only healers ? no way<BR>3 man group no cleric, paladin main healer ? rethink your group...<BR>4 man group with paladin and maybe a druid for healers ? possibly, but no chance<BR>i see people wanting 2 druids in their groups for healers over paladins<BR>i see people put druids in their groups INSTEAD of paladins for healing abilities<BR>i see paladins being left out of groups in place for warriors and monks and rogues BEFORE a paladin.<P>well.. now that hybrid experience penalties have been removed... more people are allowing hybrids back into their groups<BR>(though friends will always group you)<P>i always figured that if i needed MORE xp to level.. wouldnt i be MORE experienced for battles ? over other classes ?<P>shouldnt paladins be JUST as battle ready and seasoned for coming battles as a warrior class ?<BR>and since paladins are so holy, and are healers in their hearts.... shouldnt we be able to field bandage more than say.... an enchanter ?<P>one thing that has bothered me since the start of everquest is the design of freeport.<BR>hasnt anyone ever wondered why paladins that are KOS to the freeport militia MUST sly and sneak their way through the tunnels to enter and leave freeport ? anyone that has has to kill Sir Lucan D'Lere knows this. that isnt the paladin way..<BR>and does anyone ever wonder how the present paladins of freeport ever get around ? (story line here ?) i mean.. doesnt those paladins ever take the boat ? or leave town ? why is BOTH east AND west freeport full of freeport militia ? and only the paladins in north freeport ? shouldnt there be a change every now and then ? amybe the paladins of freeport may take over east freeport one time.. or take over west freeport some time..<BR>come on verant.. all you have to do is change the NPC's to paladins... then change them back maybe in a month or so... keep it changing. make a quest about it... invade freeport, like you once did with SplitPaw.<P>ok.. getting off topic...<BR>anyways.. those points above i think should be addressed, if i missed something in my reasoning, please feel free to point them out.<BR>never can hurt to have constructive critisism.<P><BR>Rubble RockBreaker<BR>53rd paladin, Forged Souls<BR>7th hammer<P>solo ? get me a druid and i will !</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ok my main is a paladin only level thirty right now but heres my tweo cents one pallys have classically been better then regular warriors in all rpgs yes we had to get more exp to level but that was the price for having the extra abilitys but here we get the shaft we cant solo anything pretty much after 29 yes i managed to solo up till then but even then it was undead in ill omen with my ghoulbane and still having to root which doesnt hold at all and heal then re root a couple times and finish healing and then fight and hope you dont die cause you ran out of mana rooting and healing i do not understand why we do not get as many hp as warriors when we should we are primarly warriors with a slight ability to cast i mean clerics get almost as much hps as us ands all the heals plus theyu can use almost the same things as us we can use slashing they cant wow im impressed one thing they cant do and i can understand us not using piercing because of us being so holy but why can we still train in guild on it if we cant use it???<BR> lots more to say but i think pallys as a class get the shaft the majority of the time we get our spells roughly twenty levels behind clerics and only every 8 levels or so do we get new ones i can understand the 8 level thing makes since but come on why cant we  use spells that clerics get twenty or more levels before us i can see nine since we wait to get spells nine levels but not twenty <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm not planning to give up my paladin after 51 long lvls. Rubble, I solute you man, everything you said is true, and everything you suggested would be exteremly useful for us.. But I'd like to add something, our resistances = crap.<BR>this has been said on tons of posts but I just gotta say this again, our melee abilities = crap.<BR>I find it really hard soloing greens, sometimes even impossible, let's not talk bout low blues..<BR>SOLO UNDEADS? my ass solo undeads, the only undeads we can solo are the undeads that don't give us exp anymore. if our melee abilities won't do it.. SPELLS? our mana is too low to nuke like an actual magic user that casts to kill.<P>STUNS ARE NICE. you say? clerics and wizzies get stuns too, so what?!<BR>Our buffs are useless in a group at 50+ with a cleric in the group. healers? nope.<P>warriors, rogues, monks, 10 lvls under me at 51 can outdmg me, no, it's not that I'm using a crappy weapon, lemme tell ya this, even if I was using a fiery avenger and a warrior with a pair lamentations would outdmg me. our 49 divine might (quest spell) sucks, if you check out the other hybirds' 49 quest spells, rangers 204 pts of dmg fire based DD, 2 seconds casting time, SK's, 60% snare with 300 pts of dmg over 90 seconds. we get a freakin' proc 65 pts of dmg to our weapon, which prolly also gets resisted like a b*tch. I can't really tell, cause I haven't finished the quest yet =P<P>OUR EPIC SUCKS PEOPLE! I would be better off with one of the ranger 1handers.<P>we are greatly lacking on weapons selection since we can't use piercing, and our 2H piecers suck, cept for the lance which is rare like a FBSS dropping 5 times a day.<P>another thing that would be nice is giving us some of the clerical DD's, no arguement there, for any the other classes reading these posts, check this out, we are outdmgd by any of the other melee classes, including BARDS! and we don't get any actual DD's. I haven't seen even one pally with our lvl 50 spell, flame of light, the fire based DD, the drop rate of it is prolly as bad as the chance of getting 10 FBSSs' in one day.. heh<P>Ro armor quests are too damn hard compared to the others.. bloodforge, ivy etched, crafted, etc..<P>our resistances are too damn low, our spells post 50 suck, and we get our stuns and soothe line of spells resisted too much.<P>ENOUGH HAS BEEN SAID.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Alright...  I play a Paladin on the Xegony server, and I want to make a few comments on the posts I've just read.<P>1) Guilds and "not inviting hybrids."  This is just plain stupid... not to mention rude.  Any guild who's primary thought on who to invite is "how will this guy help us kill Trak/Inny/Whatever" is NOT a guild I want anything to do with.  The guild I am in (with all of my characters) does not have this attitude.  We help each other and help others.  We have fun, socialize and enjoy the game.  That's what I believe a guild should be about... not about who can kill Trak the fastest.<P>2) Soloing.  Paladins (and SKs), I have found the ultimate weapon for soloing in the 25-35 range... the Two Handed Practice Sword.  Yeah, a 6pt damage shield may not seem like much... but when you've got it, it helps like crazy.  From level 26 to 30 I was soloing Goblin Warlords and Sarnak Recruits in LoIO... and when the skellys showed up I could often chain-solo for a bit.  Yeah, I had some down-time... yeah, I had to do the Root/Back-off/Heal routine sometimes... yeah, I was in serious trouble if two or three mobs started hitting me at once... yeah, it was tough at times finding things to fight... (the competition is fierce; and without SoW to move around quick, finding a mob that isn't taken can be hard.)  But I did it.  Whip out the 2h-practice, beat on the mob until it procs, change up to sword & shield or DW Harpoon & spear (the best weapon for working on peircing for a Pally, btw) and go to work.  You get the practice on all your melee skills, plus you're doing what you've always heard about... Soloing.<BR>Oh, and at level 30 I can... and have... soloed hillocks & tumps at the giant fort in FM.  Only just hit level 32, so I may go after a Brae soon.<P>3) Balance.  If Verant wants to call Hybrids like SKs and Paladins the "defensive tanks", then our ability to take hits should be higher than a Warriors.  Our taunting ability should be the same (or just slightly less), while our resistances and AC should be dramatically higher.  Personally, I think Paladins (and yeah, SKs) should be nearly immune to spells cast by mobs that are more than a couple levels lower than they are... and very resistant to spells from the rest.  I think that Dragon-Fear should be substantially less effective against "the defensive tanks" than against other classes.  Let the Rogues, Warriors and Monks do all the damage.  I want to be the one who everyone says "Did you see how that Paladin just kept pounding away on that dragon?  It seemed like the dragonbreath didn't hardly slow him down!"<P>Obviously, this is a pipe-dream...  But, it wouldn't be hard to put in.  Simply increase the defensive abilities of Paladins and SKs to the 252 mark... raise the AC of mid/high level hybrid armour and double the "taunt factor" of any taunts done by a hybrid.  Heck... triple the taunt factor against Undead.  They should hate us even more!<P>Who cares if others do more damage... I want to be the one who is ALMOST (Not totally, mind you) required to let them do all that damage.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>you know what Drakewyn, I truly like that way of thinking, it's another way to help us go on the big raids or get a group faster and you know, like, not think twice on whether taking the awesome monk that deals so much damage it's unbelievable or take the pally that can stun, and maybe heal abit or whatever it is we contribute to groups right now, and I mean the higher lvls (51-60) groups that just can't handle crap without a cleric since everything has so much HP that it just sucks.<P>but anyway.. even if we do get those awesome deffensive skills like you said, higher AC, higher resistances, etc. well, that doesn't mean we have to suffer so badly with our oh-so-pathetic offensive skills, and don't tell me it's not like that, cause every class has got to do some soloing at some point, whether for loot or for fast exp. But this is just pathetic, lemme give you an example, yesterday me and a shaman friend decided to go kill the whimpy giants of frontier mts for fun, so having a shaman with me, I whipped out my nasthar (which I like cause it's fast, especially with FBSS) and got a nice haste buff from my friend. while he was sitting and medding outside I went in and started clearing, I was hitting so fast, (atleast I was tempting to hit) tiny hint there in the brackets if you haven't figgured out. Although I had some good very nice fast powerful hits, I constantly kept missing on giants that have been green for several lvls. THAT'S NOT RIGHT PEOPLE! that shouldn't happen! we are generally not balanced with the other classes when it coems to EVERYTHING! and yes, I'm also talking bout SK's, their larger selection of weapons, their, I believe I can say, MORE USEFUL SPELLS.. I read an SK's reply on one of the boards, and well, he said something bout his spells being useless with a necro in the group. now tell me, what are the chances of having a necro in the group? and what are the chances of having a cleric in the group? <BR>we all know that pro 50 groups can't handle anything without a cleric, but it's not like every group has to have a necro or it's hopeless, cleric on the other hand, makes that statement true. <P>Generally that's as much as I can come up with now that I haven't posted on my earlier posts. <P>51 Cavalier of Rodcet Nife.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Great post here.  All hybrids need improved as well as all melee classes.  We just cant compete with caster.  I think that a Paladin should be the night with the 1hs and a sheild at the front of the line, taking all the damage.  Mobs should hate us more than anything else.  Not because we outdamage others, but because we are the Holy Warriors on the battle field that anything evil should want to take out first.  The Paladin should relish in standing in the middle of the front lines slugging it out with the mobs.  But at higher lvl's and smaller groups, we are asked at times to be clerics and med and heal.  This should never happen to Paladin.  We should not outdamage a warrior.  We should, however, out taunt anything, the mobs should just naturally hate us, and be able to take more damage than any other class.  Ex; The galant Paladin stands and fights a loosing cause so that his comrades can make a safe retreat.  Instead of, Paladin having to pull back first, or comrades begin to pull out and mob leaves the Paladin all alone to chase the Paladins comrades.  Just my 2cp.<P>Thx for reading</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok im gong to post a couple more thoughts... so bear with me! <P>1. Everyone agrees paladins as a rule are one of the hardest classes to play. Not for the reasons they should be harder then most classes though! We are supposed to be the Divine Warriors in the game chosen buy our gods for such and given special abilitys because of this. Give us some usefull spells why not a dd like even if its a once a day dd like lay hands assuming we would have to rest and call on the favor of our god to regain this ability and no this should not be able to be resisted and should go up in damage as we level showing the favour our god has towards us being a loyal servant of them and yes we should have alot higher resistance to at least disease and posion then other classes to be consistent with all other rpgs and the paladin seen in them<P><BR>2. Yes our ac and defensive capabilitys need to be raised drastically after all we are all about defense <P>3. yes a warrior should out damage us but not because our damage is bad but because they have the ability to use two one hand slashing swords at once therfore increasing there hit rate on any given mob but we also should be better then anyone at one hand slash and using a shield <P>4. And lastley as a rule paladins have always had equivelent hps to warriors of the same level in all other rpgs they use the same hit dice as a warrior we need to be able to live up to our image as the ultimate defensive tank hp is part of it paladins should be the last one standing even after casting lay hands to save a commardes life there by saving the group let the warriors do the damage and bee the fercious fighters there suppossed to be but let us be the person that gaurds the group from death the one that sacrifces themselves to save the rest if you have a paladin class it should be that a paladin class not woops im sorry guys im outy of mana and im constantly missing oh and by the way my taunt doiesnt work so yall are going to die even if i cast lay hands to save one of yall. We should be the ones saying back up heal up a bit i can hold it off so yall can either a get away or b heal up and help finish it off.....<P>fyi to verant i have been playing paladins in rpgs for close to twenty years i would hope i know how to play them by now and no we shouldnt be a fire based dd it should be a god based dd after all we are holy warriors not a half caster as everyone seems to think in truth pallys are not hybrids but a class of there very own and there in lies the problem</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ok this will fix paladins(SK same changes but #2 reversed)so groups will want them two things:<P>1. Defense, all hybrids give up melee to cast spells. OK this i can handle but make it half melee given up,(i.e. rangers give up defense and palys give up offense.) So with this make our ac and maybe HP same as warriors and up our defensive skill caps. This might make us better pincushions than warriors but will never make them obsolete like they make us currently. Make a new skill like parry but for shields, then our no duel wield will be balanced.<P>2. new ability or new spell: AoE protection vs evil. AoE attk debuff for evil mobs, i think this should be passive and always active (holy aura) but if that sounds too much like a bard skill then make it a spell. Or if you REALLY haveto then pro vs undead but this again will disenfanchise paly's on most raids.<P>Summary : basicly Vi keeps us crappy tanks because they don't want to make warriors obsolete, but i think we should be GREAT tanks on the pincushion side and just not able to deal out the damage, youll still need warriors becuase they dont need mana to do real damage and youll always run into high ressist mobs. So VI if you see this think about paladins being equal (or better)to warriors in the defensive side of tanking we wont make them obsolete as we are made now.<P>The new basic group layout if this happens:<P>puller/tank: pal/war/sk/mnk<BR>melee'er 1: war<BR>melee'er 2: war/rngr/mnk/rog<BR>crd cont: nchntr<BR>healer: DUH but shmn/drd too (i guess)<BR>nuker : mage/wiz</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok...I think I can agree with pretty much everything I've read so far.<BR>Seems like everything is harder for a Pally and the rewards just don't always seem worth it.<BR>WE used to have "THE Fiery Avenger"   Bar none -- Best weapon in the game. Then everyone got one. Sure, we get 2 now, but still...we lost one more little thing that gave us uniqueness and actually made a group want you around.<P><BR>Why is Ro SO much harder to get than every other class armor and not that much better. Heck, I'd take an Ivy Etched Tunic over a Ro BP any day. Is 1ac THAT much better?  NO...<P>I TOTALLY agree that Pallys need some sort of DD spell. Give us SOME sort of lower end Cleric DD at least. I totally respect the fact that AT LEAST we get greater healing long before rangers...but WHY are our spells SO poor in contrast to SK spells...i mean PETS...what tank needs a pet?  Give me a break.<P>Well...I'm most likely reposting the same old same old...<P>But look at it this way VI...my first character was a Pally...i stuck with him through trying 4-5 different classes.<P>He is 28 now...has been for about 5 months.<P>My druid will be on the planes next week...<P>When did playing the pally stop being NEARLY as much fun...<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Not only the damage, also the spell.<BR>Ranger new spell is HP and ATK buff<BR>SK new spell is summon corpse<BR>but Paladin new spell just a resist disease.  What's it use for?

</FONT><HR>As a level 54 Paladin on the 7th Hammer, the one thing I notice is our lack of weapons that can be obtained through non-questing. Look at the Loot tables for KC as an example. Paladins come up way short compared with all the other Tank classes. Since I'm not a member of a large Guild that can assist in obtaining the "Best" Paladin weapons (i.e.  FA, FD, Zephyrwind....) and play alot of the time on off hours, I only wish we had similiar drops off similiar MOB's as the other Tank classes.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/eek.gif"> tired of using my Mith 2-hander.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif"><P>-54th Cavalier, The 7th Hammer.    </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I feel the same pain as you all on some of the same topics discussed here but I just found this info on castersrealm that should make you feel a lot better.<BR>4) Paladins: <P>a) Add Endure Magic spell at level 30 <P>b) Add Resist Magic at 55 <P>c) Move Guard spell from 49 to 39 <P>d) Move Armor of Faith from 53 to 49 <P>e) New level 53 paladin spell, Divine Glory, clone of divine strength but 100 hp instead of 200 <P>f) New level 59 spell, Celestial Cleansing 110 hp healdot per tick, for 4 ticks. 1.5 second casting time. Recast time 30 secs. <P>g) Defense skill cap made exactly same as warriors<P>I think the most important one here is the Defense cap. Keep in mind that this has just been brought to the test servers. No word on going live yet but we will all just have to sit back and wait to see what happens.<P>Lets be positive, I think Verant has been doing some nice things to improve our class along with other Hybrids(Long Wait though).<P>Btw the 1hp is called Harpoon of the Depths not Deepwater Harpoon.

</FONT><HR>While I do agree that paladins suck at dealing damage we are far from being a suck charecter.  It is possible to solo even past 50 against low blues with use of rooting and healing.  Especially if you have the rubber ducky hat.  Our buffs arn't all that bad.  Still get a lot of use out of symbol of pinz.  After a fight healing should be a paladins responsibility.  And we can outtaunt just about any class if we blow our mana into the mob.  The only thing I find lacking is when fighting with multiple groups.  I just can't do enough damage on the mob to help out with the group getting experience.  Even wielding the semiepic weapon Nature's Defender.  <P>Dew<P>*by the way why did elves, a race of skill and speed get a weapon that is slow and hard hitting?*  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
