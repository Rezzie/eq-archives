When is Verant going to fix this dang bug? <P>Unfortunately, the issue that allows this to occur is buried very deeply into EQ's core.  The only way that we could stop it would be to move the corpse to a nearby point upon death, but that could get unpredictable.  In short, it would be fair to say that we have no short-term plans to address this issue further, and that any GM or Guide can assist you with the recovery of a corpse that is stuck in a wall.  Another option available to you is the /corpse command which you can try when right next to the wall where you died.  Nine times out of 10, that command will get your corpse out.<P>-Gordon<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Petition a GM when a corpse is stuck?   LOL !!<P>We were transferring our stuff off of two characters and moving our characters to Halas when one of us got killed.  We were new and didn't know of any time limitations. We had 2 CIMS, 1 set of banded in inventory and 1 set of banded on, jewelry, etc.  When we got back to where the attack took place, behind a wall, we could not get the body. We petitioned.  And never ever got a response.  <P>We checked to see if there were GM's logged on. Yep. One.  On a server of 2000+. He or she logged off long before we did.  Needless to say, we wrote it off to experience.<P>And one more time (of many) to learn that GM's will never respond.  I leave them alone and hope to god they leave me alone. They are worthless.  Never once have they ever responded to any corpse retrieval problems or harrassment issues.<P>I am very unimpressed with GM's.  I am very unimpressed with the nerfing that goes on. My god, if you don't have the game right, then why was it out for sale?  Bugs are common in software, but to never fix one?  oh wait, that's MS Windows.. you learned well!<P>Sure, I could just quit the game, but why should I? The game is good for the most part. The GM's suck and the nerfing sux. OK, so does the lag and downtime... but to think that a GM will fix things much less respond?<P>How about when we petitioned last night when a guy was calling us dirty names.  A GM finally responded to one member of our group who was in the middle of a battle and because she didn't answer the GM fast enough, the system said the GM wasn't on but was.<P>No one else in our group that had petitioned on this issue was ever spoken to.  <P>Try this.  Many companies do it.  Log on with an character no one knows and try to get help for these issues and see what kind of treatment your customers are getting.  Get a stuck corpse.  Or ask for help on harrassment.  (I hate that I have to play a male character like I did on battle.net to keep the HNG's from harrassing me -- many female gamers go thru this and it sux and I had thought your company would have a better environment for that.)<P>Why is it that the GM's can get our corpse and we can't? Why can't code be written that would emulate that part of their power for certain preexisting conditions? IF you can't fix the bug, at least change the decay rate for any character that is equipped, regardless of level.  What if a GM that might actually respond is busy or not around til the following day? There are some serious flaws in the corpse issue that need addressing.  Granted, those with God power and lvl 50 don't have those problems but us lil young characters do.<P>ok, I'm done ranting and raving.  <P>/petition Have a nice day. =)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I've been caught by this corpse in the wall bug far too many times.  And no, the corpse command hasn't helped.  GM's typically take at least an hour or more to get back to you.  I understand that they are busy, but it's still very frustrating to experience this bug over and over.  ..and I can't imagine how much GM time is spent dealing with this issue.  I have a simple solution that Verant could easily implement.  Increase the range of the corpse command.  My problem has been that my body has been too far into the wall.  With an increased range, I probably could pull my own body out of the wall.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I have also heard of a bug related to this that happened to a guildmate of mine.  He had died in lguk.  He had given consent to a good friend who drug the corpse to near the zone.  As the friend went to zone he saw the corpse being drug back down by someone we assume was invis.  Unfortunately he had already zoned.  When he went back in the corpse was no where to be found.  The guy who had originally died could never find his corpse.  He ended up petioning, and got a response from a guide a bit later.  They finally found the corpse but it was invisible.  When he was able to loot it, everything was gone except a bag with a no drop item in it.  Everything was gone.  Generally you would assume the person with consent to have taken the items, but this a very good friend of ours.  The guide went on to say that she would file a report on it, but that a GM would not be on that night. (Which brings me to ask, Why is a GM not on during prime times??? Are they not paid to be there???)  The guide also said that it is unlikely that a reimbursement would be given.  Why??? This is obviously a bug.  You should have logs that show that a specific player looted particular items from another players corpse. I have heard of this happening several times in guk.. I also have seen where Mennix has reimbursed these people.  There is obviously a bug with the consent code or somehow related to a corpse.  I have heard these stories for several weeks, but have yet to see people complain other than shouts or word of mouth within the game.  I don't know how many actually go to these message boards to complain.  But it should really be investigated.<P>Thanks!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Had a similar problem in the NW corner of the spider room. died twice there. Both times, my corpse fell through the wall. The first time round, when I got back there, I couldn't see my corpse. A /corpse would reveal nothing and had to /petition (which was very promptly responded to). <P>The second time, again /corpse did nothing. gave consent to a party member, but likewise, /corpse did nothing. Being a SK, he then did a Locate corpse fist, which instead of targetting me, targeted my corpse itself.

</FONT><HR>Abashi, you may not be aware of the nature of some of the 'corpse in wall' bugs.  L Guk has a particularly nasty one where, if you die while swimming from the corridor to zone to (or from) the bedroom, your corpse will virtaully ALWAYS end up inside a wall, far from where you died.  This has happened to me and several friends every time we died swimming in that area (usually attempting to escape a GIBS train).  I have verified using locate corpse that the body actually seems to be far from the water, possibly up beyond the dead side zone line.  These cases always require intervention by a guide.<P>Dying close to a wall and falling through it has never been a big deal for me, since when I start getting low I pay very close attention to where I am =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

He lost the money, and all jewerly and weapons, etc.. he had on him. Luckily, he had alot of friends that pulled together to get him back on his feet.

</FONT><HR>I can add veification that these bugs exist.  I once got killed in Steamfont right near the entrance to LFay.  I know exactly where my corpse was, but after hunting that whole area for about 30 minutes I couldn't find it.  After panic set in I finally thought of using /corpse.  Stood right where I knew I had died and summoned by corpse and it appeared.  SO sometimes there is a bug that leaves your corpse invisible.

</FONT><HR>The deal with not being able to see your body after you die is common, in or out of a wall.  When others can see it and you cant, you simply have to camp and log back on.  Your body will be visable to you again.  If you consent another to loot your corpse for you, they will not be able to loot any no drop items, or loot any bags with a no item in it.  Hope this helps someone in the future.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Quote - "In short, it would be fair to say that we have no short-term plans to address this issue further, and that any GM or Guide can assist you with the recovery of a corpse that is stuck in a wall. "<P>What if no guides or gm's are available?  This is a very frequent occurance where no one is online or available.<P>Makes me wish Asheron's Call was a better game.  Competition is very important, and would result in a better game in the end, and better customer service.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=020667&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=020667&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
