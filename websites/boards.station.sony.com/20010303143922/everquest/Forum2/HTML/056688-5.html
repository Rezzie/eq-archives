</FONT><HR>Map of ToV to PoM: http://www.swtoys.net/tovmap.gif<P>Original map from: http://eq.stratics.com/crmaps/maps.shtml<P>Spawn dots are not that accurate (Very inaccurate. Don't try sneaking based on this information), but they give a slight idea of what to expect. I managed to get there alone, as a human warrior. It is no longer possible after Terris went down, so I'd expect traffic to PoM will slow down on all servers again. <P>I never went left at Aaryonar, perhaps there are less spawns taking that route. From what I saw, it would be nearly impossible to sneak back. Even if it were possible, there were hardly any safe spots for a mage. There was one safe spot shortly past PoM, but I didn't stay long enough to guarantee no roamers path back there.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alright iron, here's answers to your questions, and please, call me sep =)<P>Your point about giving the cards to all the npc's is very valid, i can see how that would make sense, hadnt thought of it that way.<P>To give the strings we just did it in the 5-8 seconds that he was up... This also really is unrealistic to ask of the zone and i doubt it has any meaning.<P>About the doors, the doors that cant be opened, such as the north and north west doors have nothing behind them, you can tell by sitting in front of them. The door behind the 2 skunk guards is the same door thats behind you when you walk into the main hall.<P>As to how many times it took, we made it one time, then due to a bug had to do it again, make sure not to camp in the corners when at pom, so we had to do it again, basicly it involves lots and lots of feigning, waiting 10 seconds, running a few feet, doing it again, while dragging the corpse. The Monk usually dies alot so its just waiting for it.<P>The 2 pictures, one is in Bristlebanes bedroom (room with the chessboard) and the other is a room which is before you reach the 2 balconies, its the room before the left balcony and the only room you should see if coming from BB's bedroom.<BR>We tried clicking them simultainious and nothing happened.<P>We tried asking about kings court and trying to find a place to play it, that didnt work.<P>We had a rogue run around talking in Thieves Cant, that didnt work.<P>Maybe doesnt work on the sphinx<P>CoV faction plays such a minor part in getting to pom its not worth ruining another faction for.<P>Puppets spawn behind the curtain and spawn only around 8:30, one after the other, then when bristlebane shows up and says nothing here they depop.<P>Bristlebane hits for 80ish and has alot more then 500k, about a million unless he just has a high regen.<P>The zone gives minimal exp, i solo'd 86 and my exp didnt move.<P>Theres nothing on the ground thats missed unless its in the maze or it spawns only at random times of the day, or its really bloody hard to see.<P>The quest for the horn and the tunarian court is broken, prince just eats it.<P>Currently drawing a map, its kinda scratchy but it'll give you a good idea.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>I find this very odd<P>&gt;&gt;Also I didnt count the number 5 as an NPC, cause I dont think he exists .. when he hits you his actuall damage seems to add to 5 .. ie. hits you for 1 and then 4, then 2 and 3, then 5 and no second attack. He also does not seem to b targetable, per sae .. again others may have differing opionions on this .. <P><BR>What if you kill the npcs in the order of the<BR>hits, ie   kill 1, 4, 2, 3 (maybe this causes<BR>5 to spawn) then kill 5.<P>For verant to code a creature you can't target<BR>that hits like that has to be a key.<P>just my 2cents<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Kzar_thol:<P>god damn ur good, i would have never thought of that killing those mobs in order of the way that guy hits. I wish i could get to PoM just to try it. thats a really awesome idea. one thing they should do is let that guy go through a couple of rounds of melee, so if lets say he hits for 3,1,2,4,5 they should let him go through a few times to see if the pattern repeats exactly or if its just random</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

the server rebooted today. As I said, when I first entered the main room (Treasure Chest, Zero One Two Three), there were only those five mobs. I came back down... 2 hours later maybe? When I came back down, there were halflings in front of ALL of the pictures of Bristlebane in the main room. I figured I just didn't notice all of these halflings the first time. Looking over screenshots, I have a nice screenshot to backup my recollection.<P>Empty room (2/23/01 2:30 PM): http://www.swtoys.net/pom/Emptyroom.jpg<P>Assorted Halflings (2/23/01 4:53 PM):<BR>http://www.swtoys.net/pom/Krupple.jpg<BR>http://www.swtoys.net/pom/Dupple.jpg<BR>http://www.swtoys.net/pom/Nupple.jpg<BR>http://www.swtoys.net/pom/Plupple.jpg<BR>http://www.swtoys.net/pom/Kitch.jpg<P>There were others, just didn't bother to get a shot of them. That was... Friday afternoon, the last time the server had gone down was Wednesday. It came up around 10:30 am eastern Wednesday morning, so these things spawned around 54 hours after the servers came up or two hours after a couple of people ran around the castle. Is there any clue what triggers these things?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I can see how easily people can post novels of information on this zone. Being a melee and unable to leave certainly is giving me the first break I've had in a couple of years.<P>Running around the zone a bit more, I still come back to the numbers. Something just bothers me when a yellow to 59 NPC only hits for a couple of points... It just sticks out as if VI wants these NPCs to be slaughtered often. 22 and 86 are in remote places. Yet they apparently have no meaning in any existant card games, or someone would have recognized them by now.<P>There *must* be a purpose for five. I don't think we should over look it. VI could have named the thing Scooby Doo for all they cared, yet this trap (Similar in actions to traps in Necropolis. See invis, can't target, cannot hit on riposte) was named Five. If these numbers do have something to do with a card game, I would assume fives are wild or something along those lines. Five is the "wild" one in the bunch, aggro and unable to be killed.<P>Also note 86 is in the sideways room. Could mean something that would make Eighty-Six a different number, half value (43? 68? 98?) or something else. More than likely 86 is just plain 86.<P>At the moment, unless you have any luck getting a response from Ferjeneror, I would lean towards the numbers. Stallions might be related to PoG, but I incredibly doubt they are the key to PoM quests.<P>Then there is still one area that I have seen no one at all venture into... No screenshots that I recall from this area. If people have found this and I'm an absolute moron for not finding a way back here in 70 hours, disregard this please.<P>Imagine you are going down the hallway where you can enter Pinky, Apes and Sphinx's rooms. Go through Pinky's room to get past the invisible wall, then make a right. You want to look for the door all the way back from the entrance to that hallway. Just before you come to it are two doors across from each other. Go up a bit, dead end with a dead door. However, that door IS a real door, we/I am just baffled as to how to open it.<P>Another exit from this mysterious (?) area is if, as you come out of the secret hallway near Pinky, you go straight. Go forward until you come to the "This way" arrow, then make a right and just keep going. You'll pass through a fake wall. You enter a library, and the only way out is the way you came in. Had a mage summon eye opposite the fake entrance of the library. It turned out to be a one-sided fake wall (From the library we cannot go past it), and the eye saw what appeared to be a very large area that, as far as I know, is unexplored.<P>I'm curious if anyone has found the way back here yet, because if they have not, this could be the missing block we are looking for. According to the mage, there is a VERY massive area back here. 5+ rooms. Before I go on about the possibilities this area holds, I'll wait to see confirmation of this area being unknown.<P>Right now I'd start to doubt Ferjeneror and look more towards the numbers, the area mentioned above (If it has not been explored, which I sincerely doubt given the amount of time people have spent in this zone) and NPCs on a faction. Donk certainly leaps to mind, being an ogre certainly stands out in pom. Ferjeneror just looks like it's turning out to be a dead end.<P>And Fire_Star, you don't even deserve a response. Realize people are spending their lives in this zone, unable to group with friends, advance in the game in terms of experience or loot, or do anything else. Then perhaps you will have some respect for what these people are doing.<P>Off to sleep, going to try and start working on a compilation of spawns, hails and port points with maps this week. Perhaps sitting back and looking at the big picture laid out in a simple fashion will show something otherwise missed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The chessboard also has alot of trap floors in it .. so I should map those anyways.

</FONT><HR>First of all i'd like to point out that i have never been to the PoM, and anything i say is based solely on reading this thread. but...<P>"Also in the version (of King's Court)I learned, the Kings went into the corners, the QUEENS went in the top and bottom, and the JACKS went into the sides."<P>Now if there's 4 corners, a top, bottom and two sides, that adds up to 8 different locations. Maybe its just a coincidence but there are also 8 halflings i believe. Could these be related somehow?<P>One other thing i noticed was concerning the mobs 22 and 86. I'm sure everyone has played this game before.... When you add 2 + 2 (22) you get 4, when you add 8 + 6 (16) you get 14. 1 + 4 = 5. Thus giving mobs numbered 0, 1,2,3,'4' and '5'. But then i spose there are two which become associated with the number 5. Just a though though i doubt anything relevant will come of these observations.<P>It should be remembered that if the npc's in the zone are given numbers, and not meaningless "a_mob_00" names then these numbers must be of some relevence. <P>Someone posted that in reality mobs 0,1,2,3,5,8, and 9 had been found. Maybe it would make sense to try and locate numbers 4,6,7 and 10 - these being the numbers found in a deck of cards, with perhaps the 0 representing the Ace.<P>All i can think of for now. Good luck.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Or something even more illogical, die to the NPCs in a certain order?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><BR>2)Is there anything that resembles a puppet-master near the puppet spawn point? I remember reading abt. a rare puppet string dropping by the CT puppet?<BR>3)Charm and give cards to the numbers?<BR>4)How many versions of King's Court exsists? Which is most commonly played by Americans?<BR>5)Known numbers that exists are 0,1,2,3,5(trap like thing),8,9,22 and 86? No other numbers can be confirmed to exists? What's their spawn time? Maybe killing them to add their numbers up? Perhaps 0,1,2,3 represents +,-,* and /? You need to some how use 8,9,22 and 86 to form a certain number? <BR>6)Do you have a full map of POM? Maybe having a plan view of the zone might yield something?<BR>7)Teleportation device? Maybe they are used for players to quickly gather at one certain spot when you manage to trigger something? Maybe some thing DO spawns when you turn in the cards but they despawn in less that 5-10 seconds that you never thought they exists?<BR>8)Talke to Fenj in 'kewl dood' speech?<BR>I hope I have said something no one has said before.

"/say Look ... %T ... %S is a %R". This could possible identify queens, bishops, rooks, etc. Placement of NPCs would be important as well.<P>If this pans out, maybe placing the Cards on the appropriate spaces in the chess board will cause the pieces to move.<P>A shot in the dark.<P>Good luck !!<P>Gooda<BR>LVL51 Rake<BR>Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Since we had handed in all cards to all npc's b4 and no one kept any we at the time decided that NO npc was looking for ANY card, because they would have eaten the card they were looking for, our Enc froze the rest of the room as it came out ... but alas she is gone 8-( Im not sure anyone, on any server is still up there with enough cards and the ability to pull that room without dieing 8-(<P>We tried some cool d00d speach ... but if you have specific phases you would like me to try .. just post them ...
