&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Please read this post through, as I think I have some valuable points to make...<P>I am an atheist, and as such find all religions as something that bothers me and even objectionable at times. Why would the Jewish kid and myself have to say prayers before class everyday, as some want. I am not trying to flame anyone here, but my point being is that others are always trying to pass off things onto me because of their faith. For example, people want to ban abortions(not trying to start a war here, just a point). You want to argue that it's killing a person, fine I agree with you along with that fact that it's an easy way for people who don't care and don't want the responsibilty of having a child. However, as soon as you bring your religion or God into the matter, I'll make it my person crusade(no pun) to make sure abortions stay legal, just for that reason alone.<P>Likewise, why are there four letter dirty words that can't be said? Because some churches find them objectional! When did they decide this, because I sure wasn't at that meeting. I mean the f-word has the same meaning as other words that relate to the act of sex, and you can say those anywhere you want. That's why when I feel the need to say the f-word, I shout out "sex" instead. And then when someone asks me why I am saying "sex", I tell them because I can't say the f-word. It usually gets at least a chuckle, except for the few who become upset that I just said the f-word.<P>My overall point being, is that we are rapidly becoming a world in which everything we are going to do, say, represent, etc is going to offend someone around us AT ALL TIMES. Doesn't anyone find it funny that some of the best nudist beaches in Europe, and also a place where a lot of European porno movies are made come from Italy? Heck, didn't they have a politician voted into office that once was a porn star or something? Yeah, Italy, the home of the Vatican, no? People have to learn just to ignore these things, instead of complaining and putting others down, which if you really study your scriptures says that you're not supposed to suppress or put others down, but help them and correct their ways! Why do you think these people that are put down come back even stronger into the faces of those who put them down? <P>Also, parents should explain these things to their children instead of sheltering them as soon as something bad is exposed to them. Sit down and do some parenting instead! For God's (Yes, I say this sometimes.) sake, it's a normal thing in many countries for everyone at dinner, including the children to have wine while eating. Here in the U.S. the parents would be charged with child abuse, and accused of promoting acholism to children. Elsewhere, where parents actually take the time to explain things, it's just a normal everyday thing.<P>So to all of you who find things that people do and say in life and in this game objectionable, get over it. I am saying that I want everyone to go around shouting penis or something, no! You're paying $10 a month and as such should not have to be bombarded with people running around cursing all the time. However, if someone was to do so, ask him to stop. If he gets biligerent, petition him and the GM should tell him to stop. If he still doesn't stop, suspend him for a few, but nothing else. <P>Remember, those who are banned are just that, they alone are banned with that name and credit card. I have quite a few siblings who would probably let me use their Credit Cards to get an account at diferent adrresses, who have no interest in PC games, as other probably do to. These people will find other ways if they want to get back into the game. So, instead of making these people incensed, and leaving open the possibility that'll they'll back even more obnxious, let's try to show them how to act, and also hopefully show the rest of us in the process that some of the things that these people are doing is just harmless pranks that usually just need to be ignored and laughed at...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wow, how amazing that the word Penis is soooo bad.<BR>Like I said in my earlier post my 3 yr old son uses the word penis because I taught him that he has a penis and nothing else, and my 12 yr old daughter learns harsher words for it at school, but she knows the proper term and believe me the boys at her school use harsher terms than penis. My daughter has watched me play this game and she has seen words typed in game that are pretty harsh and she shrugs it off, I teach my children right from wrong and teach them reality, I mean look in magazines there are pictures for ads of what have you and you can see two men kissing or two women kissing and yes I teach my daughter what its about, why, because its life, reality, and believe me there are harsher things walkin down your street then what you find in this game.<BR>Banning someone for using the word penis is silly IMHO, have a talk with the person sure, but banning is just plain silly.<BR>Sorry for rambling but geez.<BR>Im due to have a baby in the next week or so, god forbid I get banned from a public place for breastfeeding my baby, hehehe ooooooo try it. And yes I fully plan to have my 12 yr old daughter be there for the whole thing, and there is nothing wrong with that even though my baby may have a penis.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am pretty sure this was not the scenario<P>/shout PENIS!!!<BR>Some guide tells you:  Shouldnt have done that, now you are banned.<P>This person most likely had many previous abuses.  Most likely this person was generating many petitions from many different players.  I tend to think that this banning was justified unless someone has some more details.<P>I say 'bad' words all the time.  I even say them in front of my kids some times when I slip up.  I do my best to keep them to myself in the work place and I NEVER say them if I am in the company of strangers.  This is a courtesy thing not a moral purist thing.  When someone shouts PENIS to the zone it is for shock value and in my mind shows a distinct lack of respect.  Whenever I see something like this I usually /report and then I /ignore.  I have a policy of never responding in any way to anyone who has ever been on my ignore list (I keep a list of those I take off /ignore).  This may not seem like much but I have watched several people die at my feet because I would not heal them and I would expect plenty of others have missed out on free buffs or maybe a res.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Just because there is a certain association with sexualtity this should have not resulted in a ban.. What if someone had a foot fetish or something and he shouted "Foot" or "I love feet" then they could find it offensive...

Also the lastest version will be out real soon and the game will be incredible. Their gaming system is loved by many more people than this system. I have never heard anyone post anything bad about the Wizardry system. Oh and Tiltowait was clearly the best spell ever in ANY game.

</FONT><HR>Pretty silly to bann someone for just shouting a word. A suspension or warning I could see, but banning? Possibly something else was done or said with no logs you can not be sure.<P>For all the people out there who say that kids play this game. And the ban was called for. When are you going to gripe at the big VI itself. Take a look in dreadlands they have MoB's named Petrefier and Stongazer ****atrice. On my account I have something called  /filter guess what happens when a group member calls out what is incoming with one of these. Yes it filters that part of the name. <P>So if you agree with this ban you better start petitioning your group members when they call out "Incoming Stonegazer ****atrice". Which would be the most stupid thing you could do. Just as this banning was.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Spiderhack says "Did your parents have any children that lived"?  <P> You have flamed me.  If you are not mature enough to disagree with someone without insulting them, then you don't belong on these boards, IMHO. <P> In your post, you use the word 'penis' several times.  Later in your post, you post a sentence that many people would consider obscene.  By your own logic, you should now be banned, because you have not only used the terrible, horrible word 'penis', but you also use a much more vulgar term later on, and children read this message board.  <P>"But it is not fine for someone to run around in a zone in a game where children play using the word PENIS in a completely different context." <P>And what, exactly, was the context in which this word was used?  Were you there?  I doubt it.  The fact is that you don't know the context in which the word was used, because we aren't given this information in the original post.  <P> Spiderhack, if you had bothered to read my entire post you would have seen that I actually said that, depending on exactly what happened, the ban might have been legitimate (because, AGAIN, we don't really know exactly what was said and in what context).  <P>  Finally, I have to wonder why Spiderhack thinks it is such a terrible crime to use a legitimate medical term for a normal body part, and yet he seems to think that racism, bigotry, and insulting our brothers and sisters in other countries is just okelly dokelly.  <BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Up until I moved a couple years ago, I still had a couple folders full of maps I had carefully drawn on quadrille paper for those games... In fact, my mom and I used to play those games together, and a couple years ago I saw the whole Wizardry set (I think volumes 1-8) on CD and got it for her, and she got a real kick out of playing them again.  I sat down and made some characters and was startled to realize that I still, to this day, remember just about every nook and cranny of the first couple of levels.<P>Technology has far outpaced that simple style of game, but Wizardry will always be a revered classic in my mind.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Who cares about prostitution, that's NOT the issue here.  What is comes down to is someone decided to be a complete idiot, and was removed from the game.  Now, to suspend the person is the normal way to handle this in the short term(you KNOW what's considered acceptable and what isn't).  If the person had a history of such stupid and disruptive behavior, then yes, being banned is called for, and expected.  This banning isn't for a STUPID reason, it's for the person BEING stupid.   While I'm not in favor of bannings for trivial things, if you do something that has even the smallest chance of getting you suspended, you should think before doing it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
