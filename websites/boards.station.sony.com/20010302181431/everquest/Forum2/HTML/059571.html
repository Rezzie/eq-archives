</FONT><HR>I can only assume that while the patch process is being administered to all of these servers... the Verant people are now looking at all these threads.<P>I am betting that they are SHOCKED at all the uproar being raised here. <P>This patch did so many good things to so many different classes.  Why such an uproar?<P>....<P>It's simple.<P>Hidden among all these beneficial "adjustments" was what I believe to be the single biggest gamechanging "fix" ever to hit the world of EQ. <P>The hatelist. Particularly the hatelist as it regards healing. By doing such a "fix" this far into the game, you really must have but your testers on fast forward. How do you create a world and tune it over 2 years to certain "constants", only to decide to drastically change one of those constants so far after everything has been tuned?<P>Clerics will have to now re-learn their healing skills, which is to say thier class. They have all new aggro management to deal with now, and timing will be competely thrown off.<P>An awesome cleric yesterday  may very well be a terrible cleric today. No matter how much sugar you pour on that, it still does not become a palatable change. <P>A nerf to clerics is a nerf to everyone. It seems that rather than make the cleric class more enticing to play, verant chose instead to spread all of the cleric's skills to the rest of the classes, thereby blurring the lines that seperate the cleric from his peers. Unfortunately, its the cleric who gets blurred, while the other classes get sharpened. Resses, Heals, buffs have all been slowly given to the other classes, and cleric items and abilities of interest have pretty much all been nerfed or in some cases multi-nerfed. <P>Clerics are currently coddled and pampered by the large guilds because they are becoming rarer and rarer at the real high lvls. Guildleaders CRINGE when they see this patch because they dread the aftereffects of losing yet some more veteran clerics.<P>Well... keep following this path and you might as well call clerics "dodo birds".</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I seriously doubt they are shocked.  This is exactly what was to be expected.<P>You have two classes that were in very high demand in the game, Warriors and Clerics, get nerfed and see upgrades in others around them.<P>Perhaps some people here don't understand the concept of balance, but it includes both giving and taking away.<P>I can understand the complaints from the Warriors and Clerics, because noone wants to have their power removed.

</FONT><HR>If this be true (that the Cleric Class is now blurred....and abilities spread to many others) welcome to the lot of the Mage. Magician magick has been treated in this fashion for a long time now. <P>Take, for instance, the fact that one of our lvl 55 spells is embedded in a monk item--allowing them to use it free of charge at will while most Mages don't even have the spell, themselves.<P>Many of our lower level summonings have been treated similarly, embedded into armor for others to use. This, of course, means the role of the Magician is just more obviously defined: unnecessary, unwanted.<P>What we have here is someone on the Live Team who is up against a wall--obviously. They simply cannot affect the radical fixes to the game balance that we want. It's all well and good to suspect that they CAN and WON'T---it plays to our egos and justifies the US vs THEM syndrome. They can't do it.<P>This doesn't mean I'm letting them off the hook by any means. The reasons they cannot affect more radical and positive game balance fixes is their own fault. They designed the game: therefore, they have no valid excuse.<P>But, I tell you, I could accept this if they would simply come out and explain in exact language the theme and role of every class in the game. Come clean, as the saying goes. To do this, however, means they will have put themselves at risk of violation. It means they would be held to the explanation and if required to violate it, we could (and would) take them to task for it. So, I don't look for it happening.<P><BR>Alc</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

We only had two high level dungeons (Guk and SolB)  When Verant created RoK they upped the level cap because we wanted something more.<P>WHen they upped the level cap, that's probably all they did, it's an entirely different game from gameplay point of view.  True this is a rocky portion of the phase 2 beta of RoK and phase 1 beta of SoV.<P>Though with this I do believe that Mark of Karn should be restored to what it was.  Who cares if paladins, shadow knights and bards don't get healed as much because they cannot do as much melee damage as rogues, monks, warriors or rangers.  There's a reason for it.  A spell that was designed to heal as you did damage should help those that do the melee damage the most.  *shrug* probably doesn't make sense.<P>Just so you know, I started off as a druid (now 53) Created a bard (53) and have a cleric (58)  Yes I will be playing all of them as I have been.

</FONT><HR>Clerics are finally going to get to learn what all other healers in the game have had to learn early on. And that is that healing while fighting certain mobs will cause that mob to agro you in some cases. It will take them awhile to get used to this. But it has been very frustrating to Shaman and Druids that they could cast a little Greater Heal on someone and get agro'd, yet at the same time, a cleric could stand there chain casting Complete Heals and nothing ever even looked at him.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=059571&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=059571&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
