</FONT><HR>I know that you said the list is likely closed, but I had an interesting thought the other night and I figured that I would spout out the idea since I think it adds some 'flavor' to the Ranger class. <P>A Ranger in an outdoor zone is at his or her best scouting the landscape for a safe spot to land their group, and tracking their quarry through the most daunting foliage. We are pullers, trackers, and often the battle scout for our groups. Well here's an interesting idea which lands on current skill sets:<P>In OUTDOOR zones only - allow Rangers of sufficient level a better tool for scouting those dangerous areas. We get sneak, we get hide, it would be an interesting twist for Rangers to almost become Rogue like while in the forest. Even capable of sneaking into that camp of Undead to retrieve a fallen comrade, or to report back for a well mounted offensive.<P>I do not believe that this makes Camo useless, as I see Camo to be more of a travel spell that can also be used on others. An outdoor Sneak/Hide ability would make Rangers even more complex in the outdoor world and further embed the idea that Rangers are most at home....outdoors.<P>Probably got this thought out too late, but I had to get it off my brain.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Jarmak Foulsbane <BR>57th Ranger of Xegony<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Rangers:<BR>ITEM:  Defense Skill Cap.<BR>DESCRIPTION:  It seems fair to move the ranger defense skill cap up to match the knights' offense skill cap.<BR>STATUS:  None<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Dodge and Riposte Skill Caps.<BR>DESCRIPTION:  If it seems that rangers still need a bit more defense at the upper levels, raising the Dodge skill cap would seem the most logical way to give them better damage avoidance.  If we want to give them more offense and more defense, then raising the Riposte cap would make sense.<BR>STATUS:  None<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Archery.<BR>DESCRIPTION:  The concern is that this combat skill is not effective enough, primarily because of what seems like a bug.  Archery seems to have a lot trouble with z-axis issues that cause the ranger to miss far more often than he probably should.  Also, why not push the ranger skill cap on archery up some, actually allowing them to be better than warriors at firing their bows?<BR>STATUS:  None<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Tracking.<BR>DESCRIPTION:  Obviously people are anxious to get the changes that have been suggested, like scrolling and sorting.<BR>STATUS:  None<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Trueshot Discipline.<BR>DESCRIPTION:  Rangers are of the impression that this discipline is not tuned up properly yet. They would like to see it do more damage and/or hit more often.  The problem with targeting here might be closely related to the situation when this discipline is used, combats where a lot of characters are trying to take swings at one enemy, not leaving any lines of sight for the ranger.  Perhaps this discipline could allow this ranger to ignore the normal issues with intervening PCs and NPCs.  Also, the discipline could be tweaked up a bit just by giving it some sort of minimum damage, perhaps a portion of the base damage of the bow used.<BR>STATUS:  None<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  More Hit Points.<BR>DESCRIPTION:  Rangers would like more hit points.<BR>STATUS:  None<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Jolt.<BR>DESCRIPTION:  Players would like to see this spell lowered in level (49th perhaps) and have another, more effective version added in its old spot.<BR>STATUS:  None<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Spell Stacking Issues.<BR>RESPONSE: This is something I was wondering about for when I am able to get the spells, I understand that these are specialty spells, that in itself should indicate that they aren't in-line with other spell lines, and such should stack, and not be overridden.<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Casting on Lower Level Characters.<BR>RESPONSE: I haven't heard of this being a problem with any of the rangers in my guild, I personally haven't gotten to the level to experience this.<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Thorny Vine Armor.<BR>RESPONSE: This would be nice, but nothing of a concern to me. If I can't get the armor one day, I very well could another.<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  See Invisible.<BR>RESPONSE: This I had questioned for some time. In order for me to work around this oversight, I've had to always make sure, while my group was camo'd that I'd remain visible… At least that way they could keep an eye on me, and the mobs that were chasing me. We should be given something to fix the oversight.<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Kylong Breastplate.<BR>RESPONSE: Not really an issue to me, so we don't get one breastplate, there are many others out there much more desireable, example is Tolan's Breastplate.<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Hide and Sneak.<BR>RESPONSE: I think these are fine as is. Why? As a ranger, we don't really know when we are hidden, unless someone there can tell us we are (no message saying it was successful, like the rogue has, and we shouldn't get a message).  We have a way to become invis in any case , Camo and sup camo.  Hiding, has no reason to be raised. Sneak, what does sneak do for us? If we're hidden, and we sneak, we become visible, if we're camo'd , we have no need to sneak. Only reason to sneak is to be able to sell to certain merchants. In that effect, it's current cap is fine, no reason to raise it.<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Raincaller.<BR>RESPONSE: This bow needs to be readressed. Maybe even removing the effect and making it a proc instead. I read the post about 5 months ago where Abashi said the ability to make bows proc was now available. The damage/delay. I'd rather be able to keep the same damage and see a 7 point reduction in the delay.<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  DoTs.<BR>RESPONSE: This I was told was a bug. That the higher level DoT shouldn't be overridden by a lower level , and should override the lower level. Never seen a message saying this was finally fixed though, it should be.<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Forage.<BR>RESPONSE:  I have an idea of what could be done here, a submenu on forage. Instead of just having forage, why not Forage Food, Forage Water, Forage . This way regular forage is still around, however, you would now have the ability to look specifically for food or water. I know if I was foraging for water, I sure the hell wouldn't be digging for grubs.<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Jagedpine Cloak Quest.<BR>RESPONSE: Always wondered about this, just wrote it off as another broken quest. Maybe all the quests should be reviewed to make sure they are all properly working and that there are no-more incomplete/broken quests about.<P><BR>Jarethe Ki<BR>44th Ranger<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Rangers:<BR>ITEM:  Defense Skill Cap.<BR>RESPONSE: I really don't mind my current cap, if you are going to raise it, please don't over do it. maybe 10 points? 15 max.<BR>---<BR>ITEM:  Dodge and Riposte Skill Caps.<BR>RESPONSE: This is something I would SO like to see.

</FONT><HR>Well thanks Absor I started a Rogue.. Rogue can use the bow and higher offensive and better defense AC/stats etc. all better than Rangers. BTW Evade actually works. Only thing I miss is the taunt ability (I would miss track if it actually worked), guess I can use Backstab when possible. Why is it in the Vision to make rangers sooo wimpy? Our dodge parry reposte should be the highest in the game. Out HP should match or better than monks. Our AC should equal Rogues.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Great list Absor, however a few items were left out or were rather vague.<P>1) Rangers lack both a once a day ability & a parent class signiture spell. would be nice to get at least one of these. I would say that tracking & archery make up for the lack of a once a day ability but alas archery is useless, tracking alone don't cut it.<P>2) Your list entry on archery only points out one of the many problems with archery & fletching for that matter. The current archery problems are:<BR>   a) x-axis & line of sight issues<BR>   b) excessive misses & shots that fail to do anything at all.<BR>   c) Damage is crap, it's no where near worth using archery over melee.<BR>   d) damage is very inconsistant and a good 40% of the time an arrow actually hits(Woot) the damage is close to the bare minimum. You shot did double damage! xxxx is hit by non melee damage of 2! /yawn<BR>   e) The 'double damage' is useless as 90% of the time both in groups & soloing a mob is either rooted or snared, not to mention this being totally artificial & tacky.<P>3) Upgrade to feet like cat. This spell's low duration is annoying & it's effect is not that great at high level.<P>On the subject of archery damage & usefulness of flecthing i would like to propose the following. Make maximum damage Bow damage x arrow damage with perhaps some caps based on skill. This would certainly make archery damage worthwhile and encourage people to actualy make those expensive arrows. At first appearance this would seem to excessive but taking a closer look it isn't too powerful at all.<P>Bow                Max damage    Average damage<BR>Windsaber  13/22 -     104             52<BR>Trueshot   20/41       160             80<BR>Underfoot  33/60       264            132<P>Wurmslayer 25/40       150             75<P>In the case of wurmslayer, it's a single weapon in ONE hand with a 50-60% chance of double attack.<BR>Also note that the archery damages listed above are based on using maximum damage arrows that cost 5pp per 10 to make. Using the average damage of summoned arrows you can halve all those damages. And before someone rushes to point out the 'free damage' defense i would like to mention 2 items: jundiced bone bracers (free 250+ dd) and the druid arms that have free 280 dot. These don't require the user to train TWO skills and constantly spend time and money making ammo.<BR>Both archery and fletching are useless, please fix!<P>Arrolas Lendel<BR>57 Outrider<BR>Torv<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Jarvathe what you dont realize about hide and sneak is this...........<P>Hide is an instant cast invisibility, there are numerous times (particularly at higher levels) when you dont have time to cast invis, but you can hide, sit down, and camp, wait for the train to pass, and camp back in.<P>Sneak allows you to get past mobs that see invis, and is useful in many more situations than you mention here. CR in dangers places for example.<P><BR>Rangers have a lot of skills no one thinks to use (hide, harmony) that are VERY useful in certain situations, dont say the improvements are warrented or needed until you have thought things thru.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Please add to your list to consider Absor...<P><BR>1) Fix forage. If im sitting and hit the forage button, I get a "you can't do this now" and then the forage button greys out for 5 mins. Really anoying. <P><BR>2) Can the team come up with better Tolan's armor spells. The only good spell is the Helm. The rest are pretty much completly and utterly useless to a lvl 50+ ranger. Even the BP needs to be fixed. Rangers claim that they can use it as a get out of jail free, but i carry a 5 stack of shaman teleport potion at all times. This BP needs something that we can use just as often as other classes use it. Like a group Chloroplast. I bet you can look at the server logs and see how often this gets used compared to other classes. Almost never. <P>3) Can you add ranger fizzling to our list. I can't tell you the waste of time i have from fizzling spells.. then having to sit and regen all that mana from the fizzle. DOWN TIME CITY.<P>4) Could we also get a self abscond type spell. Like the druids have, but self only. The reason i suggest this is:<BR>  a) Druids have it.<BR>  b) We dont deserve a GATE, but some type of life saving spell. Like LOH, or Divine Aura, or Feign provides. All this would do is move us temporarily away from danger. Could even make ours outdoor only. Please add to list as a suggestion. Even as a role play rangers could summon natures assistance to avoid death.<BR>  c) Not unbalancing, as it is self only, doesnt do damage, nor does it allow ranger to kill more mobs.<BR> <P>Thanks<P>mec<P>Lvl 58 ranger<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"ps- Don't see why they don't make the bonuses stats give you increase with levels, since that would in no way help twinkies (the main reason they nerfed stats)."<P>Hmm, like the way the WIS-to-mana conversion works.  Very nice idea - might actually make all those +stat items useful after a while.<P>Other comment - Glimpse is not useless.  I've used it a lot to check out a camp before starting to pull it.  Now, Lull Animal...*that's* a worthless spell.<P>On forage:  at 45th, with a maxed forage skill, "junk" isn't an issue...I keep two full stacks each of food and water, and have no problems keeping them full or refilling them after handing them off to other players.<P>On the person who wanted more buff slots - I finally started running into this..."No!  No clarity - I don't have any room left!"  Especially since Celestial Healing (my friend's favourite heal) uses up a buff slot...and so does Invigor...<P>"I can pull - Anyone can pull"<BR>Not true...there is a lot of skill to pulling.   Rangers get several major advantages to pulling - outdoors, we get Harmony; we get snare (much better to pull when your not getting smacked over the head all the way back), and we get track.<P>"Am I the only person with maxed skill for my lvl (165) who finds camo to be total junk. I can honestly say that on average, Camo lasts less than a minute for me every time."<P>To be quite honest - no, I don't find that.  Any invis spell is random duration, but on average my Camo lasts pretty well, and that's with a skill somewhere in the 130's, last I checked.<P>On finding groups:  Some days are better than others.  Some days I can walk into DL, shout for a group, and get multiple tells in about five minutes.  Some days I can sit there for two hours and get nothing.<P>"But coming from outside the class looking in Rangers really don't offer much to a group."<P>Judging from the rest of your post, I think you've just never met a really well-played ranger.  I admit I'm not over 50 yet, so I can't say too much about that, but...<P>At 45th, a ranger can be primary tank.  Consider this group:  ranger, druid, cleric, wizard, 2 shaman.  In a dungeon, no less - we did this in the Hole.  No chanter, and the ranger tanking (mostly).  We held our camp spot with no deaths and one evac for about 6 hours or so (the one evac being on our first try to break the spawn...once we figured out how the spot worked it went fine).  We've done the same group replacing one of the shaman with a chanter or second ranger all over the world in all kinds of zones very effectively, although it probably helps that we play together a lot.<P>"As far as a secondary melee I'd still rather see a monk &lt;great for pulling&gt;"<P>Properly played, so are rangers, although I'll agree that there are some pulls only a monk can pull off - I can't wait to get mine to 17th and FD.<P>"or a Rogue"<P>Can't really argue with that...I play one of those too, and love her.  Although I really miss spellcasting.<P>"Also the panic animal line would be nice."<P>I think this has gone in on test, if I remember right.  Agree - would be nice.<P>"I'm also still not sure what's up with Ranger healing...your stuck with what light heal until 39<BR> then you only get healing?"<P>I mostly use my heals to top off group members and as a mana transfer for shaman.  Although I've been in a couple groups with no real healer and had to keep people alive with them...definitely not recommended, but it can work.<P>"oh..and btw I really hope druids get scrolling and filterable tracking...was playing around with it on test...nice stuff. =P"<P>Call me greedy, but I'd rather keep this one ranger-only.<P>"ITEM: Hide and Sneak.<BR>RESPONSE: I think these are fine as is."<BR>Agreed - only time I ever use sneak is when I really need that indifferent faction, and the only time I use hide is when I'm so oom I can't camo and need to med.<P>"Rangers have a lot of skills no one thinks to use (hide, harmony) that are VERY useful in certain situations,"<P>Agreed - I NEVER see anyone discussing harmony (one of the best spells in the game, right after snare  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">), or Bind Sight, both of which I use frequently.<P>"Could we also get a self abscond type spell. Like the druids have, but self only."<P>Nifty - I like this one too.  I'd definitely like to see some kind of "get out of death" ability; it's certainly something we're lacking.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Mennion,<P>I've thought these through. I honestly don't see Hide and sneak as needing a change or to be buffed at all, Those are a rogues signature, for one.<P>I'm not a rogue, I'm not a woodland rogue. I'm a ranger.<P>Hiding, although it's nice, isn't as dependable as camo. If you hide and camp, you come back into the came visible, That is if you really DID hide to begine with, No-one, other then a rogue, knows for certain when they hide, if they really are hidden. That I believe should stay that way also. It's a no mana invisibility spell, yes, but it's not something we need improved. It's fine as it is.<P>Sneak, another rogue signature. However, this doesn't allow you to sneak past mobs that see invisible, try it out in the giant city on the two bridge guardians. camo, and sneak, they'll see you and attack. What allows you to get past see invis, when camo's is the drop in aggro range, and some actually good programing concerning camo vs see invis. This is the same for rogues who use hide and sneak, see invisible mobs still attack. Honestly, there is no real reason, other then trying to ubber ourselves, for us rangers to get a boost in this either.<P>The only real important things, and these have been fought, endlessly by many of the frequent board-posters, Sunmoon the most vocal of all us rangers, is the following:<P>Fix the archery:  to where we don't have the phantom/missing arrows (no message saying we hit or missed, but the arrow no longer in inventory) and an arrow missing.<P>Fix our defense: Maybe 15 (max) points to defense, but we should be able to dodge as good or better then plate classes. Although we shouldn't be able to riposte or disarm even near a monk or rogue ability.<BR>Our AC is fine, we are a chain class, not a plate class.<BR>Our health is fine, we aren't to be muscle bound barbaric warriors, we are the finesse of fighters, we should be avoiding the attacks at us, not withstanding them.<P>Fix the Raincaller: This should be revamped so we don't have to continually do the quest. It should be a proc, not a right click. Shouldn't be based on charges either.<P>Fix Tracking: We are, and should be the masters of tracking. I understand Druids having this ability, to the limited degree they do, but I can't understand why Bards were given it, or why it's being considered currently, for rogues. If you want to give them a tracking ability, it should be Players only tracking, no NPC. that would fit "Stalking" as the rogue class ability<P>Work some with the balancing of us in the effect of warrior/druid mix. too many of our spells come too late to be of real value at the level we get them. Atleast, they are looking to readdress them, a few of them anyway.<P>The only other issue, they have already fixed, the dreaded exp penalty, which I am estactic that finally, after all the e-mails and postings, that those of us sticking to our views inthe face of everyone saying give up, got it removed and corrected to how it should be.<P>Jarethe Ki<BR>44th Ranger<BR>Rodcet Nife<P>Every ranger should be using harmony for outdoor pull control.

But I think, giving us something a little more group friendly, such as a group spell Druids have, may help improve a Ranger's group friendliness.

</FONT><HR>No offense to Darg, but all sorts of Mage summonings have already been stolen by items usable by other classes.  Since Mages can't, in many cases, use these summoned items themselves (such as Quiver of Marr or Pouch of Quellious) the ONLY purpose of these spells are to give out to other classes.  If the other classes can summon them without us, as Monks can allready summon the Pouch of Quellious, it makes some of our highest level spells moot.<P>I would strongly urge Verant to NOT give away any more high level Mage summoning spells, and I hope Mages will be given a few more unique summoning spells to make up for this problem (and item inflation generally.)<P>Not that I don't want you guys to have these things, I just want grouping with a Mage to be an advantage.  I happilly provide arrows for any group members that ask, and when I get high enough, I will happilly provide the improved ones too.<P>Shaper, 20 Mage of Veeshan<P>&gt;How about makinc a small change to Raincaller,<BR>&gt;Wither in supliment to the existing right click<BR>&gt;event, or as a replacement.<P>&gt;Summon Quiver of Marr, Once per 72 mins, or even<BR>&gt;144 mins, Add the nodrop tag to the quiver and<BR>&gt;arrows summoned this way.<P>&gt;This would have the effect of making Archaery<BR>&gt;viable to the post 40 rangers, whialst not<BR>&gt;completely eliminating Fletching as a means of<BR>&gt;obtaining arrows..

</FONT><HR>I think I speak for a lot of rangers when I say, we should have the ability to get animal friends.  If anyone on the EQ design team ever played a ranger in 3rd Edition D&D, or even a druid at that, they'll know that at level 4 rangers have the ability to get animal friends.  These animals follow the ranger or druid around, being a companion and friend to their character.  They aren't used much for attacking because they aren't the most powerful creatures.  But the ability to have an animal pet is very fun and interesting.  I think that you could easily give this ability to rangers in EQ.  It shouldn't be overpowering, but it allows high level rangers to make low level (1-20) animals their pets.  The charm spell lasts until the ranger zones, follows the ranger around, and makes the ranger happy.  I think this is the perfect sort of thing to satisfy a lot of our requests for something which will make us unique, as well as giving us something that we can use to add a little bit of flavor to the class.  I was a little bit surprised when this wasn't put in on your list of balance issues, because there were a number of posts requesting some sort of animal charming ability in the original post where you asked for ideas.  And panic animal is bad, we don't need something that will make animals be afraid of us.  They're supposed to trust us and be our friends because we're protecting their homes.  But thats just my opinion and a lot of people probably disagree.<P>Gaerith Hawkrising<BR>Ranger of Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Two more things on Rangers:<P>1.) The post I made earily about defensive skills for all melee classes was intended for the post-50 game. Overall the skill caps in the pre-50 game are fine, and well balanced. It is just post-50 where the Rangers get screwed, as well as the other Hybirds, when the other melee classes skills start increasing, but ours don't.<P>2.) Why do the other Hybirds(Paladin and Shadow Knight) get 24hours game time (72min real time) skills but Rangers DON'T?!? After looking into it more, all the melee classes get a defining skill that makes there class unique except for Rangers and Bards. When I say unique I mean a skill or ability that NO OTHER class has. Here is a quick run down of those skills.<P>Warrior- Critial Hits, Cripiling Blows, and Berserker Fenzy<BR>Monks- Feign Death, Improved Kicks, and Improved Hand to Hand<BR>Rogues- Backstab and Evade<BR>Paladins- Lay On Hands<BR>Shadow Knights- Harm Touch<BR>Rangers- NOTHING<BR>Bards- NOTHING<P>To me this doesn't make any sense, thus I have thought up an idea that for a Ranger Only skill that could be used once every 24hours game time (72min real time).<P>Name: Nature Shield<BR>Effect: Shields Target with a Rune type buff that lasts until the Target zones, or the shield is used up.<BR>-Size of the shield would depend on the level of the Target with the max level being the level of the Ranger using the skill. Then this level would be multiplied by a factor to get the size of the shield. This factor would be determined by the table below.<P>-Table for the size of the damage absorption shield:<BR>Targets Level -- Mult Factor -- Shield Size Range<BR>-- 01 to 20 ---- x10 ---- 10hp to 200hp<BR>-- 21 to 40 ---- x15 ---- 315hp to 600hp<BR>-- 41 to 50 ---- x20 ---- 820hp to 1000hp<BR>-- 51 to 60 ---- x25 ---- 1275hp to 1500hp<P>Example:<BR>-If a lvl 30 Ranger would use this skill on himself a damage absorbtion shield of 450hp (mult. factor of lvlx15) would encase the Ranger, and would last until used up or the Ranger zones.<BR>-If the same lvl 30 Ranger would use this skill on a lvl 20 Druid then the size of the shield would only be 200hp, because the Druids lvl is lower. (This is to prevent Power Leveling using this skill)<BR>-If the same lvl 30 Ranger would use this skill on a character of a higher level then himself. The size of the shield would only be 450hp.<P>-This skill would stack with the Enchanter Rune line of spells.<P>As for Bards I think a Area Effect Mez skill that could be used once every 24hour game time (72min real time) would be appropriate. The level of the Bard would determine the length of the Mez.<P>Just some more thoughts.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Talone Trailblaze<BR>Level 48 Ranger<BR>Divinus Veritas<BR>Drinal Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I will repost below but will summarize the changes as yet unlisted.  The ones listed seem good, esp the defense 230, and dodge/parry increase.  The offense as on test, seems to go well with this, while keeping our AC still well below what warriors can accomplish.<P>However, we deserve group gate and evac.  I say group because of the reasoning that goes with it.  You have granted Feign death and summon corpse to SK, which in light of their incredible armor and very good hp, is a very impressive combination.  I have watched them with their FA in action and they are a force to be feared.<P>You granted the Paladin a resurrection, which though less than the level 56 version, restores an impressive amount of exp, allowing them to self restore or to cast it upon any they so choose.  Truly resurrections are amongst the most sought after abilities in the game, and to couple that with a defensive ability that is and should be very stunning, and several very powerful magic weapons, gives them abilities that make them a force in the game.  The convenience of being able to resurrect themselves far exceeds any other hybrids abilities.  They have very good hitpoints and do quite well in a fight.<P>Granting rangers group gate in addition to the proposed offensive and defensive, hp, skill and spell abilities is entirely in line with the quality and usefulness of the other hybrids.  It will provide some of the convenience and group saving ability of a paladin, some of the escape ability of the SK FD, and I strongly believe a great deal of relief to the ranger class in general, that they are special and that they have a set of skills that gives them a special place in the world.  The effect on the combat and experience gaining systems would truly be minimal.  The effect on morale, would be incredible.<P>I realize I risk your wrath in mentioning this topic, when you have denied it as an option.  But I plead with you one final time, because it is something that is very important.  It would really make us complete and I urge you to consider it.<P>I'll skip my reprise of the earlier post.  I truly hope you give this one your consideration.<P>Thank you, all these posts and working with 300,000 players who all have ideas is not easy.  The effort is appreciated.<P>Thank you,<BR>Anemone<P>*work to make Norath a world people want to come to...*<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hail,<P>I'll keep this simple and to the point. Ranger's are masters of the bow. This fact was stated by Verant but, in every Movie, book, RPG, and electronic RPG. Verant has missed this point by a mile. I understand that balance is a big issue but, another class name should have been used other than Ranger then. I chalange the powers that be at Verant to play any of their competitors games that have a Ranger class and look at the archery abilty there. You can blow the dust off of an AD&D module and the Ranger is the master of the bow.<P>In every RPG the first class I play is a Ranger and Verant has managed for the first time in my RPG career to make a Ranger undesirable in this skill.<P>I dont mean to rant and rave but, for the love of Tunar, cant you see this is what is right for the class.<P>Well thats my 2cp<BR>Quillan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I missed the earlier opportunities to post but would like to add my two coppers since this thread still seems to be taking input.<P>I have a 25th level Ranger and while I enjoy playing the class I too believe there are issues that need to be addressed to make the class more in line with it's intended role.<P>*  ARCHERY - Definately needs "improved".  Ranges don't have the AC or HP of a Warrior but we do have the ability to stand back and inflict damage like a caster.  This helps to offest the fact were not a full melee class, but we need to be able to contribute MORE to the damage pool with a bow than we are now.  Personally, I don't want lower firing delay times unless the expensive arrows can be recovered after the fight (yeah, right)- faster shooting only means I empty the quiver sooner.  <P>Give us the ability to STUN with an arrow (is that what the ****atrice point is SUPPOSED to do?), have it tip coated with POISON by Rogues to act as a DoT or allow us to FIRE "enchanted" flaming arrows (with cool particle effects).<P>As our skill increases we should be able to hit for critical damage more often or shoot between fighting mobs and PCs like a true Robin Hood or William Tell.  We should be able to shoot up or down the Z-axis at any time (presently this appears to be a programming constraint not class based)<P>Sure, we can kite with a bow but the difference is that arrows run out and mana recharges over time. This means we could lose money kiting if we have to shoot 100 arrows to kill a mob.  And why oh why does a master archer miss at point blank range... six times in a row when the mob is rooted?  At the very least allow a minimum damage based on range.<P>If the idea is to shoot two arrows at once as I've heard, then they need checked separately for a hit or miss.  Firing two arrows and having BOTH miss ALL the time is well.. improbable.<P>* BIND - Yes, Rangers should have an outdoor only bind. It makes sense and has nothing to do with class balance.  (While were at it warrior types should be able to bind in cities as binding has absolutely nothing to do with gameplay).  It's a mechanic of the system.. where do you want to return when you die?<P>* PORT - I don't see it as a NEED but it would be nice to have.  I like the idea someone mentioned of self porting to the four basic rings. If nothing else, lowering the level of SoW or providing a lower level self-only SoW would certainly help. Really, I don't mind running outdoors.. I'm a Ranger... but, I hate to spend an hour of game play running from one end of the world to the other.  Enchanters can trade Breeze for a SoW no problem, but low level Rangers have to PAY for or BEG to get one.<P>* TRACK - I hear there are improvements coming.. great.  I hope one is the ability to see what mob is closer to you instead of which one has been around longer.  It's VERY frustrating to track a mob that is halfway across the zone as you pass two or three that were closer.  As far as other classes having Track.. Muwahahaha.. nerf em.  Rangers are trackers, thats one of our "primary" skills.  When I hook up with a group that has a Druid doing the tracking I know something is  wrong. <P>*  DEFENSE - It would make sense to have the DODGE skill raised as one of our primary stats is DEXTERITY and we wear lighter armor.  So we SHOULD be more nimble than a plate packin warrior (why do you think they are called tanks  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> but not much as a Monk.<P>*  HIDE and SNEAK - definately improve outdoors. We, like our parent class, are one with the forest.  We should be able to find better cover out there don't you think?<P>These are my suggestions and some are re-statements or clarifications of others posts.  Bravo. The way I see it if a LOT of paying customers restate issues over and over that means a LOT of paying customers want them.  If "the company" doesn't "please" it's paying customers then it's only a matter of time before the company loses them to a competitor that does.  Don't take it personally.. it's business basics.<P>Yared (stilllookingforthatperfectlastname)<BR>25th Ranger of Tunare<BR>Officer of the Gryphon Alliance on the 7th Hammer<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>late in the discussion,please read tho.<BR>  first suggestion fix archery,not just the above angle bastiche problem,grr!but the damage 3 arrows with 20 damage bow with 205 skill in archery doing 1 damage,WTH?! how is it possible that i could do 1 damage with 23 base damage weapons to a lvl 10 bunny,this is one item that you should be very adamate about,archery should do damge as 2hs weps,a 23 43 2hs sword would do a minimum damage,why not apply that to bows?in my opinion,that lvl 10 bunny with 40 hp,should be dead in one shot,why? cause i am like 40 lvls above it,and my archery is 205,meaning i should be able to shoot quite a few mobs in the heart,head,eye,lungs very easily causing them to die.<BR>and what is this aggro thing with doing no dmage,yet the mob turns on you and comes right for ya,it's archery,you know,distance sharpshooting,for all the mob knew,it came from the gods.<BR> second and last is my suggestion on defense,leave  it alone,BUT add one quarter point for each ac point to our ac,if it's 1.5 now,increase to 1.75 mulitplier,that in itself will give us more ac,yet not change our defensive skills at all,i would be happy with that and i think that it would not screw with your idea of the rangers being the offensive tanks,we still would have less ac than tanks,less defensive skills than tanks nad rogues and such,but would have higher ac than rogues and chain wearing classes.rogues are leather based class,monks are cloth,rangers are chain,warrior are plate,paladin(which is cavalier or knight in old times) is a plate class without the same multiplier as warriors.that is the reasoning behind rogues with more defensive skills,warrior with more defensive skills,and paly with more ac.please note this down for discussion,one quarter point mulitplier added to our current multiplier,would add maybe 30 ac in my case,making me non buffed at,i think,900 ac,or just a few points below,self buffed would put me at around 950ac,which would be same ac as a non buffed paly warrior with about same gear non buffed.<P><BR>eslef 55 mage(post ranger rage)<BR>belgadon 46 druid(post post ragner,mage rage)<BR>makril 52 ranger (always mentally dysfunctional,cause i got used to dying ,"how many times was that today?"vanje says to me.)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>How many times does it have to be said? <P>FIX ARCHERY!  All bow-using classes should be able to shoot from anywhere above or below the mob.  (Spells can be cast on mobs above and below you so don't say it's not possible.)  All bow-using classes should have a minimum damage applied, such as with a 2hs weapon.  RANGERS, however, should get an additional damage bonus based on either their skill in Archery and/or player level and/or a "once a day" skill (such as Lay on Hands/Harm Touch).  What good is it to spend (several) platinum per arrow (yes one arrow) when a whole stack of them *might* do as much damage as ONE round of melee combat. *boggle*<P>The Ranger's lack of defense/hit points can be negated if the ranger can *effectively* (with the damages listed above) shoot arrows into a target during the first half of a battle or until such time as the real meat shields have built up enough hate.  Then, at half-life the ranger can engage in close quarter melee combat to lend their speed damage to finish the mob off.  With this tactic, the ranger won't have to worry so much about their defense, but can STILL contribute to the welfare of the group via archery, which would be the FIRST time that would ever be possible.<P>The tracking changes on Test are awesome! Please keep the /tracksort and /trackfilter unique to our class.  As a 49th lvl ranger on Test, I have experienced first-hand the GREAT way in which distance sorting can help, especially for pulling in an outdoor environment.<P>The new Tracking changes are nice, and come close to being "class-defining".  We're still missing one component of our "class definition" though, and that would be ENHANCED archery, such as I suggested above.<P>Aradril, 49 Ranger on Test</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I worked like mad in my younger days to max taunt, only to find out later on that in a group (if a group wants a ranger) I have been told not to use it. We become sink holes for heals. Clerics can not keep up with us.

My only real concern is that of the archery and tracking problems<P>1 rangers are to be considered the robin hood's of EQ right??? Okay if robin hood could split an arrow in two then why can we hit a 1-2 foot wide mob from 100 feet away, archery definitly needs to be tuned up as we have no difineing quality as rangers.. more dmg or high accuracy. At almost 2 pp a shot and you miss like 1 out of three times it gets expensive. Also for a 2pp one use arrow it should do more dmg. I understand that archery is being looked at but that is my 2 cp on archery.<P>2 Tracking  our tracking is getting better with the new changes imposed in the newest patch but we still need more..I dont know how this can be changed but we are woodsmen and woodsladies (hehe) and the outside zones are where we should shine..<P>Anyways the new changes are great and we are well on our way to being equal with the other hybirds now<P>Joba Torelox<BR>Clan Nameless<BR>Ranger of the 34 Season<BR>Tallon - Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

It will do you a world of good.<P>Verant does care, Why? Simple. They know if they don't start paying more attention to their customers, their customers will soon migrate to otehr games that are coming out. Which means they won't be getting your /our money. That is the reason you are seeing these class discussion boards, after 2 years of being active, that's why you are seeing changes occur to attempt to please the customers that play the game, but still retain balance. <P>Personally, all you accomplished is to show that some people are too immature to be left alone, no matter their age. So instead of flaming the boards in your junvenile pre-pubescent manor. Why do you go back to the tv and watch Barney, and leave the discussion to us adults, who understand what's being said in these threads. <P>Jarethe Ki<BR>44th Ranger<BR>Rodcet Nife<P>* Seen the patch message.

The amount of suggestions in the Ranger talk that were flat out ignored is staggering. <P>And to top it off giving Rouges tracking somehow made it on to their list. In a way that just shows how blinded Verant is to actual class balance, but it is also a benefit. Once they add tracking to Rouges there will be absolutely no reason to play a Ranger, so we can all delete our Rangers and start new woodelf Rouge characters. We will be better off just roleplaying Rangers than wasting our time with a class that Verant obviously has no clue how to fix.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>BlueJay is right,<P> If Verant gives Rogues tracking, then Rangers should just delete themselves and make woodelf rogues.<BR>Rogues have better ac and health, damage and offense, defense and avoidance, no spells, but no need for them, they can use all weapons just as good or better then rangers including the bow.<BR>They have everything a lot similar, only thing is they can't forage as good or track, if they are given tracking, who really cares about forage?<P>With backstab, tracking, hide/sneak, jboots, spells on armor and equip, exp bonus, higher AC, Health, Duelwield, double attack, ability to change race with masks, poison, better offense/defense, ability to "invis" in doors and out at early levels, faster leveling, ... ****, why play a ranger anymore then?<P>Play a rogue acting like a ranger.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>just a quick comment.<P>One of the stated ranger defining skills is tracking.   Two other classes already have it .<P>I cant believe they are considering giving it to any other classes too.<P>If rogues get track I will believe NO REASON GIVEN for not giving at least the low level self only ports to rangers.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>     I think it would be keeping with the role of a Ranger if we got more of the Animal line of spells. For Example more in the Fear Animals line, Invis to Animals, Sense Animals and at higher levels befriend animal line. It seems we get a few of these like Calm animal and now Panic Animal but never get any contiuation on this line. I would not expect to get all the best spells in this line but would like to see a progression in this line similar to our Skin or coat line. This seems to be keeping with the role of Rangers as masters of the outdoors and protectors of nature. I relize some of these do not really balance the class but will add to roleplaying of a Ranger. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000668-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000668.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000668-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000668-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000668-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000668&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000668&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
