</FONT><HR>quote:<BR>The ONLY reason not to allow melee's to bind themselves in towns is so casters can keep bleeding us.<BR>end quote<P>You're right.  I confess.  I want you to bleed out, and then get a transfusion of someone elses blood so you can bleed some more.<P>Get hold of yourself, guy.  More then half of the people in this thread supporting melees getting NPCs to bind them are casters.<P>What most of us do Not support is giving the mundane fighters the ability to do it themselves.  Why?  You're a fighter.  We are casters.  We cast spells, fighters get massive amounts of HPs, the abilities to wear armor we can only dream about, and various other advantages.<P>I've made it a point to temper my resentment of all the would be King Arthurs out there that made Merlin get nerfed because he was too powerful compared to their head bashing skills.  Your increasing hostility toward casters in general makes me wonder why I so much want melee types to get the benefit of NPC binding.<P>Then I remember that you're only one person, and *too many* suffer because others can't take time out from their group or their kiting to bind them.<P>NPCs to bind in the cities, and lets hope Verant puts in some convienient bind points where the casters won't mind taking a moment to do it without having to cross three zones. For the other ones, that is.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Verants refusal to consider the addition of bind vendors in certain cities reflects poorly upon the design skills of the EQ team. The only motivation I can think of is to keep players playing longer.  Any other excuse is just that:  an excuse.  Class interdependancy?  Yeah - right!<P>Recent changes have shown that Verant is willing to actually listen to it's players on non-trivial issues, which is a nice change.  Maybe they could take a minute to re-evaluate this with the players enjoyment in mind.<P>It is not like a handful of bind vendors are going to ruin the game.  Why would ANYONE be opposed to Ogguk getting a bind vendor?  Or Erudin?  How many opposed have a melee character? What else could they be afraid of?  LESS downtime perhaps?  how dumb is that?<P>-tera<P>btw - FIX RALLOS!

</FONT><HR>Sorshasu,<P>Travel benefits both high and low level characters.  At lower level, death is more common.<P>Lets take an my Ogre.  At level 4, I decided to make myself some patchwork armor.  There aren't any bears around Oggok and Ogres need ruined bear skins.  Considering my options, I decided I would travel to the newbie log in Neriak.  Best option, considering I could arrive safely.<P>So I travelled.<BR>From Oggok to Feerrott<BR>From Feerrott to Innothule<BR>From Innothule to South Ro<BR>From South Ro to Oasis<BR>From Oasis to North Ro<BR>From North Ro to East Commons<BR>From East Commons to Nektulos<BR>From Nektulos to Neriak<P>Finally, I could get a bind without worrying about the dangers that might happen upon me.<P>Not good.  I could have had an 8 zone corpse recovery run, with no guarantee I would make it the second time.<P>No travel, no armor.<P>I got my armor and headed back (to train).  When I got to Oggok, there was no one in sight that would bind, and my bind point was 8 zones away.  It took me an hour to get a bind and during that time, there were at least 10 people of over 40th level who could bind.  Guess they had bad faction with the only places I could get bound within 4 zones any direction.<P>Or they were busy with Important things people do at 40th level.<P>I have made this journey many times at later levels, only to die a couple of times due to uncontrollable circumstances (like Sand Giant getting trained on me from behind).  When that happened, I had the inconvenient 5 zone walk back to my corpse.<P>Fact: There aren't enough bind points.<BR>Fact: People aren't always available or willing to bind at existing bind points.<P>I don't hunt in the Karanas because they are too far to run from Qeynos, Highpass, or the Arena if a griffon sneaks up on you in Combat.  If I could bind closer, I would.<P>I rarely hunt lizards in Feerrott because its so difficult to get a bind in my hometown.  If I could bind closer, I would. <P>Guk, Innothule, and South Ro are out as well.  They look like fine places to hunt up to 20.<P>I hunted in steamfont with an Ogre for a bit, but closest bindpoint is Greater Feydark.  Its not worth it.<P>I might hunt in Unrest, but I know the closest bind point is Greater Feydark. (Kaladim is further and KOS to evil races).<P>The current system is limiting.  It could and should be improved.  <P>1) The number of places that non casters can be bound should dramatically increase.<BR>2) There needs to be another mechanism besides player dependency to bind in unfrequented places; otherwise, they will remain unfrequented.<P>You are free to decide not to change your bind place; however, I contend that if you were a caster, your decision would be considered foolish.  You will die sometime in the future, and when you do, you will have inconvenienced yourself.  Since you are not a caster, it is not a foolish decision, but a foolish circumstance that you must make that decision.<P>Finally, there must be a balance between needless death and being so careful as to never die.  One who dies occasionally might actually gain in experience and wealth faster than one who does not die at all.<P>There are achievements to be had by those who take some manner of risk.  For example, I have enjoyed participating in the following.<P>1) Hunting Orcs in Highpass at level 14.<BR>2) Pulling from the first level of unrest at levels 16-19 efficiently.  Camping the hand, ghost, etc. in the low 20's.<BR>3) Camping Guardroom in Highhold at level 19.<BR>4) Attaining Rune of Ivy from Castle Mistmoore as level 24 ranger. (No, I didn't buy all my Ivy Etched Armor).<BR>5) Attaining Heart of Fire from Solusek A at level 26.<P>etc.<P>I enjoy the challenge.  Without the challenge I won't enjoy the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>BlueJay said:<BR>"The only reason a caster type would complain about melee types having some kind of bind ability is simple pettiness. Class envy is the most inane attribute I have seen displayed by EQ players. Why would any player care if some other class got an abililty that simple made it more enjoyable to play the game?"<P>Greed also comes to mind, or to a lesser extent a simple lack of understanding on the part of younger casters who have not played melees as well, that those fighters they rely on for a little change to make ends meet really do need it more badly than they do. Some also are frustrated that their classes are less usefull later on, and look for any leverage to get their own problems fixed. This appears as class envey, but that really isn't the root of the problem. Some, of course, are trolls  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P> Quandary said:<BR>"To expend your fantasy/reality sense argument, then reincarnation makes no sense. A lot less sense then binding to a plce does since the purpose of the bind is that you'll reincarnate at that point."<P>There is quite a lot of  'willing suspension of disbelief' in EQ (and any video game, of course) over the differences from a standard fantasy genre setting. It is nice, however, to keep these to a minumum. We ignore the fact that we respawn from an RP prespective (well, not everyone does, but I have yet to hear someone give an RP explanation of players respawning that is as palatable as ignoring it - all the attempts I have heard have reeked of cheese) and we tolerate respawn for the sake of playability. There is no such gain from having the 'set respawn location' be implemented by a spell as opposed to a button on the options/general menu or a transaction with an innkeeper NPC.<P>...and:<BR>"What fantasy genre have you ever read or watched when the dead come back to life minus only some experience and the items that weren't in the back?"<P>As many as I've read where people die to random lag and link-death. <P>...and:<BR>"So to eliminate that which make no sense by your argument, we need to also implement final death. Thus binding becomes moot." <P>It would be more realistic, by far, although we're a long way off in both game design and net infrastructure from making it as playable. I prefer to see as few elements as possible that make 'no sense' implimented.<P>..and:<BR>"NPC binders can (or should be able to) do the job. Anything more then that just comes down to what has long been the bane of RPGs: People that insist on playing fighter classes, then piss and moan about the casting classes."<P>And in future RPGs to come, players will insist on playing every variation, and insist that they all be viable, preferably close to equally so. Rightly so, to my thinking.<P>...and:<BR>" Casters have had their spells SO watered down over the years to come into balance with the fighters, that tricks like bind and levetate are the only reasons left to play them."<P>Likewise, people will insist on playing caster classes, and piss and moan that most of them are not as desired in the endgame as a melee or cleric. Both flaws should be fixed, and we should all risk being labelled 'whiners' to achieve this end. <P>"Take the NPC binders and let it be. Casters have already lost enough to make fighters feel better."<P>Give them to me, and I will be happy to :P<P>And please, they have lost nothing 'to make fighters feel better' they have lost some relative strength to make a more balanced game. It is entirely possible that they have lost too much (at least at the top end), and if so that should also be corrected, although when it does it will not be the fighters losing strength 'to make the casters feel better' either.<BR> <BR>Sorshasu<BR>"I have a FAR better suggestion then giving melees self bind (or any form thereof). Learn to die less. "<P>Even those who die very little often bind for every major relocation. If you can't get a res, whatever downtime is required  to get a bind (even when it reaches entirely unreasonable levels) is worth covering the risk of taking a boat ride or two to get back to your corpse.<P>Tarnak said:<BR>"Beware, if you ask for being able to get bound by a NPC in town, casters will demand something in exchange, they view their ability to bind themself as something that count in the balance of classes."<P>Give them whatever INTERdependance related thing it is they depend on melee characters they have no intention of grouping with for. Or, on a more serious note, drop the insane resistances that are no longer needed on 'boss mobs' with well over 32k hp to compensate.<P>Morathii said:<BR>"No, I do not believe melee's should be able to bind. No, I do not see NPC binders as a solution as this detracts from player "interdependancy.""<P>You misspelled 'dependancy' :P<P>Morathii continued:<BR>"However, one solution I see as viable is "bind potions" from shaman. This would create a new market for alchemists, other than the standard SoW/Shrink potion market. The potions should allow melee types to bind anywhere they can currently be bound, just as if a caster had bound them. Thoughts? Flames?"<P>At a reasonable brewing price, this would be entirely acceptable.<P>Methusela222 said:<BR>"Also, Verant could make standing stones in game bindable area with-in a limited radius about the stone/sign post - with a few of them self binding? or all of them caster assisted binds?."<P>This, also,  might be enough. <P>While I would personally prefer no silly begging for a 'set respawn point' spell, the real point here is to eliminate unreasonably long searches for a bind.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Buchenko-SV replied:<P>quote:<BR>There is quite a lot of 'willing suspension of disbelief' in EQ.....<BR>end quote<P>Of course there is, which is why I addressed your "what we see in the fantasy worlds" issue in the first place.<P>quote:<BR>There is no such gain from having the 'set respawn location' be implemented by a spell .....<BR>end quote<P>By your own perceptions, of course.  This selective implementation of what deserves our suspension of disbelief and what doesn't is obviously, to -my- perceptions, self serving.  You lose 10 debate points for trying to compare the "reality" and "sense" behind game rules to fantasy novels, then revoking that "sense" when it suits your purpose.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Overall, and not by you, the selective application of what is reality (in the fantasy worlds) is one of the worst things that games suffer from.<P>Designers decide that bows with unlimited arrows aren't realistic, for example, so you have to buy or make the arrows to use the bow.  But they don't care that arrows which vanish into thin air, rather then sticking in the target or laying on the ground for the archer to pick up again, isn't realistic either.  Again, selective implementation of subjective reality, and it doesn't work.<P>Various games have had their own idea of how to handle the bind point concept.  Asheron's Call has bind portals which anyone can use.  Meridian 59 sent everyone to an underworld upon death, then players had to try getting out through a doorway that ported to different places in their world via a random cycle of changing locations.  EQ has bind points.<P>An argument that one way of setting a home point for reincarnation is more "realistic" then another is silly.  All you can argue is which one you find to be more desirable, and face the fact that when others disagree with you, their perception is as "realistic" as your own.<P>quote:<BR>.....in future RPGs to come, players will insist on playing every variation [of character], and insist that they all be viable, preferably close to equally so.<BR>end quote<P>I prefer, in my "reality", the logical fact that casters are, by their very nature, more powerful then similar level non casters or partial casters. <P>King Arthur was the finest fighter, magical sword in hand, in the land.  Merlin could turn him to dust in an instant.  This is back to your fantasy reality concept.  Games that attempt to balance classes by cutting back on the power of spells while at the same time having them eat up mana so that in the end both the fighter and caster do about the same amount of damage are far from consistent with the fantasy reality that you brought to the table.<P>quote:<BR>It is entirely possible that they [casters] have<BR>lost too much (at least at the top end), and if so that should also be corrected...<BR>end quote<P>Should be, yes, but it won't be corrected in this game.  Perhaps one of the future ones will have the courage to deal with it in a fantasy reality manner, but this one chose average damage over an average fight at equal levels.  <P>This is an evil we put up with due to their also unreal concept of the level gap experience penalty in groups.  In other games, usually the older ones, casters were naturally much more powerful then fighters, but fighters leveled at two to three times the rate of casters.  <P>Two characters both created at the same time, one fighter one caster, would come into balance by the fighter making level 12 while the caster, who had much more to learn, only made it to level 4 or 5.<P>That's a debate for another thread though.<P>I still say we need NPC binders in the cities, and more bind points for fighters.  I'll add, again, the need for some true neutral cities or towns where any race or class is equally welcome and can bind without fear of guards.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>All quotes from Quandary:<BR>"Overall, and not by you, the selective application of what is reality (in the fantasy worlds) is one of the worst things that games suffer from."<P>But it remains the only option, given that VI, and its future competitors, must design and run these games with limited resources. I would hope that they do care that vanishing arrows are not realistic,  but merely choose to assign fixing it a low priority. Of course, once they finish fixing binding  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> it would be nice to work on recoverable arrows as well. Although a sound business strategy might require the EQ2 team be the ones to do so. And like them, we must make our value judgements about what is worth implementing (or arguing for.)<P>"An argument that one way of setting a home point for reincarnation is more "realistic" then another is silly. All you can argue is which one you find to be more desirable, and face the fact that when others disagree with you, their perception is as "realistic" as your own."<P>Given that the activity is entirely a game mechanic, the only answer I really like is for it to be a command with no game 'justification' at all. I'ld rather see it as a button on one of the option menues. Or as a /command in the EQ interface, where it will compare with things like /who, /lootnodrop and /tell &lt;guy 2 continents away&gt; for 'realism' level, rather than teleporting and hurling balls of fire, which I can actually picture characters doing in a fantasy setting. The Asheron's Call method has a gameplay  advantage in that it does not hose one type of character, but I don't recall ever reading a novel where anyone went looking for a bind stone either, so it doesn't really add much  'realism' to me. At least the innkeeper thing would provide renting a room as some vague metaphor for binding. <P>And yes, of course, I will continue to argue for what I find more desirable to no end :-P<P>"King Arthur was the finest fighter, magical sword in hand, in the land. Merlin could turn him to dust in an instant. This is back to your fantasy reality concept. Games that attempt to balance classes by cutting back on the power of spells while at the same time having them eat up mana so that in the end both the fighter and caster do about the same amount of damage are far from consistent with the fantasy reality that you brought to the table."<P>And yet Arthur is the hero. So while Merlin should be far more powerfull, the person playing Arthur should not percieve that he is in Merlin's shadow ... how do you support this in a game?<P>"I still say we need NPC binders in the cities, and more bind points for fighters. I'll add, again, the need for some true neutral cities or towns where any race or class is equally welcome and can bind without fear of guards."<P>Perhaps Moss Eisley will do it. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

So while Merlin should be far more powerfull, the person playing Arthur should not percieve that he is in Merlin's shadow ... how do you support this in a game?<BR>end quote<P>Arthur understood and accepted his role, the role which Merlin actually gave him.  Of course, in a game, people wouldn't accept it.<P>I like the style of letting magic users be as powerful as they should be, but making them need double (or more if needs be) the experience to level that a fighter needs.  This would also use a system where any level can group with any other level and still get a proper amount of experience for their particiation.  <P>Not my idea.  D&D began this style of play, and it was great.  Just because my friends got to level 9 (very high) didn't mean that I couldn't roll a level 1 and join up with them.  <P>D&D also used a system where the number of spells that could be cast per game day was limited, but that wouldn't work in this type of game where fighting is all you really do (it drove me crazy in Bauldar's Gate).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048402-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048402.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/048402-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=048402&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=048402&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
