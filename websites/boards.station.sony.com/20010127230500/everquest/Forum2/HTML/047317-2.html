</FONT><HR>I once was charmed by an enchanter of my own guild and he was rather nasty out of the blue. Fortunately it was in Arena and I did not loose exp. I was THAT mad, especially as I made it out of the charm and closely ripped him to shreads with my bladed thulian claws (he 5 levels higher than me). As he escaped with a blind/invis combination with about 30hp left I was really pissed.<P>Anyway - it was a duel and I cannot blame him for using charm as spell. That is fair. When experience loss happens - VERANT are the ones to blame. Not the enchanter. It is bad style of a GM to blame a player for using his spells. I did not know you do NOT loose experience in a duel. <P>There is no manual page that sais: DONT send a PC against a NPC with the charm spell. There are no nice-play rules in my EQ or the manual. That is a bug and Verant has to fix it. Fixing players for using their spells is stupid.<P>greetings<BR>   Kiky (Morell Thule)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>LittleDog i see the rules, and they are the same rules that the 5 GM's tried to use on me.<BR>but <BR>1. Povar is not a PvP server. the rules you listed where that of the PvP server. it doesn't seem to me that they have specific rules set aside for a single duel on none PvP.<P>"You may not intentionally cause experience loss to another player, such as by "training" them."<BR>(didn't train on them)<P>Training is defined as pulling an NPC along behind you and attempting to get it to attack another player who does not desire that engagement.<BR>( this is different then making a PC attack an NPC)<P>The intentional training of NPCs will result in immediate disciplinary action when witnessed by an EQCS<P>"1.2 Special Rules Regarding PvP Servers <P>Causing Experience Loss<P>"Intentionally causing experience-loss to other players in the PvP environment is illegal in all cases and will result in a warning when witnessed by an EQCSR. This includes things such as intentionally training NPCs, and purposefully allowing an NPC to get the final blow in combat."<P>2. i hate to say this, but yet again these are Pvp server rules and sorry cause of Verent an EQCSR must actually view this for it to be filed as charge, which is kinda crappy i think. but no where does it say that charming an PC in a duel and using them as a pet is illegal. i mean i could have swam her to the bottom of lake Rathe and said /pet guard here.  it's plain and simple don't mess with an enchanter or anyone in a duel that can cast spells that will cause you to die. hell thats why i never bother with necros with my ranger. Darnkess,fear, pet kickin my butt doesn't seem very fair, and getting killed by the pet and losing exp.. not fair either. if anyone with half a brain that plays this game knows what the person they are dueling is capable, and i even stated that was how she would die... <BR>i don't know where else to take this, and its not taking the easy way out, or cheating. <BR>but what is this really about. winning the duel or losing the exp?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yes, those are rules specific to the PvP servers.<P>However, Verant HAS applied these same rules to NON-PvP servers while in PvP situations (ie, a duel).<P>You didn't get pinned for it this time.<P>But if you do it again, don't complain if they end up warning/suspending/banning you.<P>Then again, they may do nothing at all.<P>Anyway, I agree with Kiky.  It's not your fault for utilizing your spells, it's Verant's fault for shoddy coding.<P>Just consider this fair warning -- now you KNOW it's a bannable offense.  Charm in duels at your own risk.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok let's revisit the rules once more. Rule number 8 there is for everyone not just pvp servers. The phrase at the end of the rule there, "such as by training", does not mean the same thing as, for example, "only in the specific friggin case of friggin training and friggin nothing else you friggin beanhead". Think about it. I think this is key to understanding the rule.<P>The pvp rule I added there was just "fyi" which is short for "for your information", not to make a point.

</FONT><HR>I don't think the 'chanter was in the wrong for one reason and one reason only: He didn't INTENTIONALLY cause exp loss because he "didn't think about it" at the time and felt badly enough about it after that he offered to help the warrior get her exp back. I can see that happening, sort of like a few nights ago when two guildmates were duelling for fun and the ranger went LD right at the end so he lost exp when the shammy's DoTs killed him. (This was between two high-levels, so the exp loss really hurt.) Incidentally, the DoT/exp loss bug was mostly fixed a long time ago, this is (from what I have read in blue-name posts) the only situation in which it SHOULD happen any more. This sort of thing should make the victor feel terrible, especially if the duel is for fun.<P>For those of you who say "screw 'em, they should know better when going up against a 'chanter and I laugh heartily when I make 'em lose exp", you make me ill. I don't even duel people with my shammy, the remote chance that I could cause exp loss with my best lines of offense just makes me too nervous. This is a game, and you people violate the spirit of gaming when your fun takes precedence over someone else's. There are plenty of options when someone ticks you off in-game short of maliciously causing exp loss, and yes it IS bannable, re-read the PnP. Somebody already pointed out that they use training as an example, not the only incidence of intentional exp loss that counts.<P>I'm guessing that the reason they didn't take action on this guy is that a) the victim didn't complain, and b) he seems like he honestly didn't think about the exp loss when he did this and felt badly about it afterward. A borderline case, but without the victim petitioning, not much they could do.<P>I do agree with one thing stated here: The observer who petitioned is a weener. Mind your own business, only petition if you are affected or the victim asks for your support. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>whatever any of you nonenchanter crybabies say, this guy was 100% in the right by using this tactic. obviously if it were not a legal method of dueling then verant would have disabled the ability to charm in a duel outside the arena where there are no npcs to worry about. <BR>anyone stating otherwise surely does not play an enchanter and is therefore visibly jealous that we are able to resort to such powerful tactics.<BR>pure envy is what i see here. my suggestion is that if you have such a problem with this scenerio then dont duel with an enchanter.<BR>type /d and all rules are off, inless you both agree otherwise before hand. there are freindly duels and there are duels such as this one that took place in which the enchanter used his tools effectively and dispatched this fool rather ingeniously.<BR>now why dont you all be quiet about it before those jerks at verant decide to nerf our charm and we are then totally defenceless.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Drak, one thing I've learned over the decades is that the louder a dog barks, the less likely he is to have the nerve to fight.<BR> <BR>People, of course, aren't as nice as dogs.  Where a small dog can always escape injury by surrendering to the big dog, a human bully shows his opponents no quarter.  It makes the weaker humans feel stronger than they really are to keep beating on the unconscious opponent.<BR> <BR>A truly strong and brave human being might fight, for fun, profit, or honor, but they will never strike a helpless opponent.<BR> <BR>This has nothing to do with the rules of a game, it has to do with the fundamental concept of honor.  I lose my temper, I do bad things sometimes, but I do not revel in these slides from grace, I am ashamed of them.  I certainly don't brag about those basest of the things that I have done, and I do not admire my own weaknesses and call them strength.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What a great tactic.  There is of course a possibility of losing exp when dueling, gm's and blue names here have said so.  I see no way that this is a violation of the PNP.  Asking someone not to use every ability/spell/strategy at their disposal is rediculous.  As a necro I will not duel if the person says no DoTs.  And I wouldn't expect a paly to not use LoH, or a Sk not to harm touch.  And I deffinatly would not expect a chanter not to charm my butt if we dueled.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>What I find more amusing..even though it wasn't the warrior that died, is that it was a lvl 18 char that got exp loss and the bystanders were complaining.  <P>The bottom line is you lost basically no experience at all compared to higher level.  So bad to the point its laughable.<P>a_newbie_shouts "paying 100p for lvl 9 full rez"<P>On the other point,<P>When your in a duel, NO holds barred.  You should be prepared for anything.  Cheese or not, I win, you lose is what matters.  Don't like it?  Don't duel.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>well it happened again.(EQCSR's say i do it again and i'm Baned from the game) i don't know what it is with me and idots. another twinked out newbie wearing all Guardian armor... i have never even seen that stuff before comes up and starts harrasing my group and when i look at his inventory he freaks and challenges me to a duel.<BR>CHALLENGES ME mind you. this time i am in South Karana at the bird city. so i accept, thinking this should be fun. <BR>of course tash/mez/charm = helpless annoying warrior who things he's hot S**t.<BR>first i have him fight a cent. archer when he kills and me and my group get exp for...<BR>then the undead cyclops comes walking by, so i sick fido on him. of course undead is probably 30+ and he is probably about 20. twink or no twink he is crushed. and my group is happy he is dead and no longer harrasing us.<BR>of course he petitions and the GM's come again warning me this is the second time in like 3 days now. again she cites PvP server rules, and all this crap about intentional exp lose, and how she's gonna boot me. so i continue to talk to the EQCSR which stands for ever quest C*ck Sucking Retart. because how can you impliment a pvp rule in a duel to a person who knowingly challenged and accepted knowing i was an enchanter...<BR>if you harrass people you get what you deserve.<BR>i don't to call a gm and petition them, cause they don't do jack. but i need to get these marks taken off. for those of you who agree what kinda of action do you think i should take in my defense? i want to petition that they formulate some sort of change, may it be everyone loses exp for duels, or what have you. plain and simple this is not pvp he challenged me to a duel so all bets are off, and anything goes. maybe verant needs to look into making sure if and when you are charmed in a duel you cannot lose exp...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sounds good, but no.  If there was no XP loss for a charmed player in a duel who was attacking an NPC, then that would open an exploit that would allow a group with an Enchanter to use a /duel between the Enchanter and another group member to make the charmed PC into a higher-level pet than would normally be possible for that caster, at no cost to anyone from the group.<BR> <BR>An encounter with this exploit could go something like this:<BR>1.  Enchanter /duels Tank, charms Tank and sends Tank against Uber_Mob_00 (which is eight levels higher than the group members).<BR>2.  Uber_Mob_00 manages to slay the charmed Tank at a cost of one-third of its own hitpoints.<BR>3.  The rest of the group jumps Uber_Mob_00 and just barely manages to slay it.<BR> <BR>Now, this group could in no way have taken Uber-Mob_00 without using this tactic unless the Tank was XP-killed by the mob.  Even so it might not be possible, because a charmed Tank fights better than an uncharmed Tank, having the NPC AI driving them.<BR> <BR>Another, more extreme version of this scenario would be a group with 5 tanks and one Enchanter.  The Enchanter simply /duels each tank in turn, charming him and sending him to fight alone against the mob.  As soon as one tank dies, another is ready to take his place.  This wouldn't get the group much XP, but it could surely be used to farm loot that was normally out of reach of the group.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

How about dueling an enchanter who you know will charm you just to get him banned since he already has two warnings on his account? <BR>Or maybe hacking his account and deleting his character? HAHA!

</FONT><HR>My God, some of you guys are ignorant. <P>Have you ever duelled much? Have you played on a PvP server? <P>Didn't think so. <P>A duel is a fight that is governed by strict rules. That is the very nature of a duel. To say that anything goes, is just an amazing show of ignorance. <P>In a duel, or outside (in a PvP environment) you must not cause exp loss. This is a golden rule. You cannot cause exp loss in a duel, or outside a duel. This rule exists always, everywhere, no exceptions. <P>It is not acceptable for an enchanter to charm you and send you after an NPC that will surely kill the charmed PC. If you were certain you could avoid exp loss, you could send the charmed PC after an NPC that he could beat, and thus lower your opponent's health -- but that'd still be borderline (and cheesy to say the least). It is not ok for a monk or a necro or sk to drag an ubermob over, and FD. yes, FD is an inherant ability, but the main issue is -- it'd cause exp loss. <P>If the only thing the enchanter could think of, to win the duel, was to charm, then he's a pretty clueless player anyways, but well -- we could tell that up front. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>/em boggle<P>Powerslave, let me get this straight, you win a duel using a tactic that was fishy enough to bring FIVE GM's to look at it, yet you manage to skate out of it....<P>Then three days later, you DO IT AGAIN? Why on earth did you think that would be any less looked at? Are you unable to assign consequences to your actions?
