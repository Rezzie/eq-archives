</FONT><HR>As things stand now, paladins r the laughing stock of EQ. As they lv they become the most obselete class in the game. sure u see lots of low lved paladins around but how many of them actually get to 60. and those that do, ask them how useful the feel. We r a joke to the whole community.<P>Almost every class in the game has carved out a niche for themselves in the grand scheme of things. Warriors deal insane amts of dmg and have the highest AC thus tanks the best. they get the best selection of weps and gear in the game. Monks deal super amts of dmg and r the best pullers in the game with FD being an impt part of it. Rouges backstab for super amts of dmg and their hide/sneak and pick lock skills r invaluable. warriors and rouges get in the new gear effects or spells they never had b4 making them much much more versitlie ie invis for warrs... all the other classes do a certain job well, yeah even if it means CoH, mod rod, dispell sticks etc for mages or songs that boost resists and mana song mez song for bards. soooo what do paladins fit in all this...<P>our spells r almost completely useless. past 50 u not going to be doing much without a cleric, even more so in big raids, so our buff line of spells become obselete, cept at lv 60 when i get that 200 hp buff. we do even go anywhere near the amt of dmg delt by warrs or rangers, heck we deal the least amt of dmg cept maybe bards. our heals... hmmm superior heal at 57, at 57 superior heal not going to cut it much when mobs do dmg by the hundreds a pop, besides we have very limited mana. that new dd we have gets resisted so much and the super long recast delay makes it a joke. our AC not that good and we cant tank that well. Our 'ubber' fiery defender isnt really that great compaired to all the rest of the others. the new nature's defender wep looks pretty nice but only tunare diety usable. LoH not even a CH and usable every 60 mins. the new discs we get, ummm 72 mins to wait for reuse? sigh. besides all other melee classes gets it. there's more but just dont have the heart to continue. so where does all this leave us? well at the bottom of the pile, and i mean way way bottom six feet under. u pally's who dont agree try and join some big guild, they'll laugh at u and some of them have a lv 61 requirement for paladins to join ie never. the only reason u get to go do stuff with guild is becuase they like u as a player and a friend NOT that ur usefull because ur not unless u at 60 want to be the one that camps out for emergency rez incase during a raid things go wrong.<P>after all this why u ask do i still play my paladin? well its because i'm stubbon and hope one day verant will fix the class and also because of the friends i made in the game yada yada. So Verant pls if u read this, dont neff the other classes because they r doing a great job, just fix this one. mind u i'm not asking to become the best melee in the game or the best tank cuz doing that the warriors r just going to complain again and the cycle goes on. give us our own line of spells and make them usefull, or consider the numerous suggestions that this board has posted on paladins. why not greatly increase our resistance to magic poison disease etc so much that we have that advantage over others when raiding or something. nuff said.<P>54 paladin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>In some cases, yes, we get the shaft.  Lay on Hands is definately our most useful skill (a whole heal?  I'll take that..), and we don't do insane amounts of damage like warriors, and we don't get the big clerical spells.  However, I play a paladin more because they're (WARNING!  NOSTALGIC MUMBLINGS AHEAD!) crusaders of good and right, and we get to slay evil for no other reason than it is.  Besides, we do make good support warriors.  We're not meant to do all the healing or all the fighting, we just do a little of both.  I'm sticking with my paladin, but I do have a monk on another server (more because I have a friend on that server than anything else)&gt;<P>Dalantia<BR>Paladin of Erollisi Marr, 9th rank</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well we do rock in duels  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Only one I ever lost was to a chanter 10 levels higher then me.  But we do need some revision.  For example, we are three quarters tank and one quarter cleric.  Then you take a ranger who is three quarters tank and 1 quarter druid.  No the conflict comes in.  The ranger, even though as much tank as us, gets the ability to dual wield and kick, and I'm not sure if their skills level gets capped but I don't think it does.  We need this as well, we are just as much tank as them.  And so what if they don't get any plate mail, they have some nice spells.  They blow our spells outta the water.  Which brings me to my next problem.  How many of you are sick of being even less useful when a cleric is in the group?  I know I am.  Our spells are completely useless at high levels because you don't go anywhere unless you have a cleric with you.  So we need a few more class specific spells please.

</FONT><HR>Think the weakness in the paladin class has anything to do with starting stats? we are one of the few classes that have 4 statistics that are imperitive to the class. with hardly any bonus points to divy between them. Mkaing us basically super mediocre, unless you want to specialize a trait (str. stam. etc) to the exclusion tot he others. sure you can get stat increasing items later in the game. or sooner if your a twink, but the over all result is a weaker class than most of the others.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I don't think many ppl roloplay nowadays, but even if you do, don't choose a paladin, u will be deeply disappointed coz the paladin in this game is not what u would expect, why? altho u have high charisma(usually) , u are not wanted in grps~ sucks eh?<BR>And u gotta know that , the SO-CALL warrior (which symbolize str and wilderness as the drawing on the cover suggest) have higher AC than u~ =) right, higher AC~ and according to the game setting u will always play with a cleric at a later level so don't think u can buff or heal alot, (well, u low mana resource adds in to it also). Pick a druid, best class for roleplay in my opinion.<P>2) I am here for FUN!<BR>  Fun? ..........ok, read the other posts so u know u won't want to be a paladin too~ =)<P>heh</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>HAHAH!! i was just thinking...imagine in this big battle and 1 of each class squares up with some monster, so the paladin in his full suit of shiny magical armor with his gelaming shield and his sword, or his flaming 2 handed giant sword of holy something-ma-jig, gets to work on the mob. well he's hacking and slashing and rooting and healing himself, and casting all his holy spells, along side him meanwhile... this huge warrior in some crazy mismatched, greasy armor welding 2 swords goes nuts and chops the mob into soup in no time, picks up his tankard of beer (excuse me ale) and goes to rest under a tree... a monk with a the skill in combat as only one that has trained for life in the martial arts calmly starts bashing and kicking the mob to death, then goes under his favourtie tree and meditates on a flower... a rogue suddenly appears from nowhere behind 1 mob and backstabs it using his 2 daggers dripping with poison and kills the mob instantly, then vanishes again... and as the day wears on, one by one the other classes finish up on their mobs and goes to rest, but this brave holy knight is still there (along with his shadowknight counterpart) hacking and slashing and casting at the mob. soon the SK finishes up on the mob with the help of a friendly pet skelton. the day wears on... the rest of the classes starts to wander off going home, before leaving a kind cleric tosses some heals to the brave paladin who as u can guess is there hacking and slashing and casting away. soon night falls and only the paladin is left on the battle field. but he is brave and holy and he knows his god will protect him. Lo, just as he is about to die, LoH!!! and off he goes again hacking and slashing, no more casting because he ran out of mana a long time ago. well to end the story he off-course died a very horrible death.<P>errr wait that was kinda long .... oh well. Look VI will never give us paladins duel wield so stop dreaming, we will never do close to as much damage as warrior, or the rest of the melee classes will go beserk again. they may improve our tanking ability ie ability to take dmg. i hope they will improve our spells by giving us our own spells and not cleric spells that are 20-30 lvs out of date. and for those paladins who r, like me still waiting for some day when they do get to work on us, please dont be fooled by them saying ok lets do something for the paladins... then gives us some small improvement eg our new dd which gets resisted so much its sad with our limited mana, and has a long recast delay, and then says ok your calss is fixed and balanced. then for a few weeks some paladins go YES!! WE R FINALLY BALANCED!! then go back to bitter depression later.<P>later and those paladins out there?? where r u guys? post some funny stuff so the rest of us can laugh about it. havent seen a paladin post for quite awile, does that mean that only i am not satisfied with our class or are you guys totaly burned out. oh well later</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As a level 52 Paladin on the 7th Hammer I have been a party to the fact that it is hard to get a group in the higher level dungeons at times. Several times I have waited hours to get into, or form my own  group. I feel if we as a class could dish out more damage we would be invited more often. The one thing that I see is our lack of weapon choices. If we want to do serious damage to the mob we don't need any of those low delay/ damage weapons (i.e. SSoY,Blackjack...). This limits us to a very few one-hand slash/blunt weapons. And unless you are rich and can afford to buy one, or get extremely lucky and win a roll to get one, we are left unable to do any significant damage. This leaves us unable to damage or taunt the mob to any great degree. We can try to "chain-stun" the mob, but this rarely makes the mob take notice of us, and is resisted about 25% of the time. So bad are our Stun Spells that a level 25, or so Shadowed Man resisted my level 52 stun, "Force". I suppose I better get back on-line and try to find a group. Maybe I will get lucky and find one within an hour or two. <P>-Opius Divine, 52nd Cavalier-The 7th Hammer. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>hey hey peace and cool down :-)<BR>no we should not condem the other classes, may they be rangers, SKs or others. i agree all hybrids need work, and that they r far from balanced.  all three classes, paladins, SKs and rangers are at the bottom of the pile just that paladins are way way under. and no, none of the classes should be nerffed, that isnt the answer. yes rangers should have their tracking ability improved, but the biggest improvement i think should be on their archery skill, which is kinda obselete at the moment.  one always imagines a ranger as during a battle to be off to one side while the tanks engage, shooting arrows at incredible speed and accuracy and power at the monsters. perhaphs if they gave rangers ability to shoot more arrows as they lv like double attack with crits or something. or the ability to cast spells which either create or imbube certain effects on their arrows... oh well what do i know about rangers :-) but the main point is that we shouldnt be say oh but this class does this and start that compairing thing going. nuff said.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ok you guys are a awsome class and you are saying you need new spells, skills, stats, and equipment well take a look at a ranger, they dont get nearly as good of equip or spells are you guys, they dont do nearly as much dammage as you guys can, and they dont get a ranger only ability like paladins do.  I also am hearing alot of moaning about lay hands, what other class can heal themselfs full life with no cast time.........none instead of looking at it like only one heal, look at it like 2 life bars, that puts your hp higher then warriors.  On pvp paladins out do warriors and rogues easy rogues need to get behind you to really do some dammage, and warriors well they cant go up against anything.  And you guys are whining about your epic quest item being too weak, well one of your epic quest items are too weak but you can get soulfire way before anyone can get there ragebringer or other class item, look at druids for enstance, they got ripped, 90 percent of the druids dont use 1hs.  Paladins got it good and the only thing you got to complain about is other classes being better, you need to nerf the necros.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Modine, I solute you man! I truly feel bad to say this, but WE SUCK, and as much as WE SUCK, I'm not gonna give up my paladin after 51 lvls. I really wish we'd get fixed already though, and yeah, to all you rangers reading this board, you can rock us when it comes to outdmging, and offense spells. I haven't even seen one pally with our new lvl 50 flame of light spell, ok, so god damnit Verant, either make it a spell that we can buy at vendors, or make it drop more! long recast delay, but our first actual DD, that's a start I guess.. <P>As a roleplayer, I know that kicking is not an honorable thing to do, and that is why we pallies don't get it, and NO, we don't need anymore deffense stuff, our offense on the other hand, well, let's just put it this way.. we can be outdmgd by monks rogues and maybe even warriors 10 lvls under us!! I've seen it before, I've experienced it personally...<P>our soloing ability compared to the other classes is quite crappy too. soloing undeads? you say.. NO, get that out of your heads, we may get all those undead DD's, but put it this way, if you want to even try and solo the lowest lvl form of undead in like, karnors or something, a pally 50-55 prolly can't do it. our melee abillities won't be able to do it, and the spells, well, we don't have that much mana..<P>at lvl 51 I can barely solo green drovlarg ragers near the karnors zone, what I mean by barely is being oom and at like, 200 hp left after the fight is over. and you know what, I've seen a ranger my lvl soloing a high blue rager easily  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> what the hell do you think of that?? huh. yes, rangers may have lower ac, but the more dmg they make, the mob dies faster, less dmg to the duel wielder. <P>another issue I just have to bring up is that our lvl 49 quest spell sucks, YES, IT SUCKS PEOPLE!<BR>oh, and while we're at it, our epic sucks too!!!! <BR>when we had FA and there were no epics it was all good, I mean, it's not like it was easy to get the FA, so, it was pretty cool, no one complained, and dropped sword were also almost the same, eg: BladeStorm, Katana of Steel Sleet 30 45, and a 972 AoE effect, 972 hp effect!!! also, Monsoon, Sword of the Swiftwind, 30 45 10 str 9 dex and haste 36% effect. ALSO, for the SK's, so that no one says that SK's being our evil brothers don't have an eqivalent weapon.. Soul Leech ladies and gentlemen, which is 30 45 and the effect used to do around 382 points of dmg, but they nerfed it to 90 or something. anyway, you get my point, that's all. <P>FIX US DAMNIT!!<P>51 Cavalier of Rodcet Nife.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'd like to add some other things that I kinda left out. something that would be nice to add to pallies, perhaps most likely the clerical DD's, I'm not saying we should get Wrath, which does 198 points of dmg at lvl 39 or something, but maybe Smite would be nice, just about as good as careless lightning or whatever it is that rangers get at 39. <BR>Another very important fact that I forgot to add, is that, the effects on DeepWater suck..<BR>Check it out peeps, ranger arms have a mana-free DoT. our arms have Soothe, c'mon guys, I don't think I used soothe more than twice since I got it at, not sure even what lvl it was even.. anyway, that's why we have enchanters in groups =P anyway, check out the cobalt legs, invis, what do we have? just another AC buff. BP, oh, this is a good one, we get to cast symbol of pinzarn thru it, but you know what? we need the god damn gems to do it, I mean, for god's sake, atleast don't make us have the gems to use it! while rangers can port to Gfay with their tolan's BP, and clerics get a mana-free complete heal.<P>All I have to say is........

</FONT><HR>Actually i dont think paladins should solo, they r suppose to be group friendly (ducks). yeah some of the effects on our dw and new quest armor r really really sad. i was playing around with it the other day and guess what, some bats and fire beetles resisted the soothe effect from dw arms. tried it out lots on low blue mobs in various places and i must say the effect gets resisted like more than 3/4 of the time, ie almost always. the gauntlets r borderline ok with the effect cancel magic but useful perhaphs for an initial pull, because after that, the mob usually gets slowed etc by the group so cancel magic is a no no. dw BP .... the need for reagents makes it useless. the thing is most our spells and armor effects r completely useless for our lv. imagine a trak or VP raid (or if that's to rare a raid for some then an exp group in say charsis or serb), if i suddenly asked if anyone wanted say symbol of pinzan or daring etc u would probably hear the howls of laughter from my guild in greater fay. heck, trak would probably be laughing so hard that he wouldnt have time to attack so even i could solo him.... hmmm that's a thought. at lv 55 on a raid i'm going to be wanting aegolism and other high end buffs, even for exp groups of 1, there will most definately be a cleric present, and thus everyone would definately be wanting at least hero, marzin, or naltron to survive our encounters.. not my spells. greater heals at these instances... u got to be joking. but our dw legs and gauntlets r not so bad though and helm does have some uses in very rare instances (ducks again).<P>On to the serious stuff. What do the paladins out there really think (and i mean serious suggestions and not comments like 'yeah paladins should get a 50 mana rend spell) of the improvements they should make to our class, with spells etc. non-paladins please, before u comment on some of the suggestions, remember this are paladin suggestions, u have ur own threads for ur own class suggestions and in no way r we suggesting that we want to see ur class nerffed, because i feel that all hybrids need work.<P>well here's mine:<P>1) like i said b4, atm warrs deal the most dmg and tank the best for melee class. rougs and mks all have their uses and deal very good dmg. why not make paladins and SKs THE best tanking class in the game ie highest AC and stuff? our dmg output would still be one of the lowest, just that we can 'tank' the best. (pls not suggesting we nerff warrs and such, just improve us).<P>2) perhaphs increase our resistance to magic, fire poison etc VERY high, in a stepwise lv way, such that at for example high lvs we r able to resist spells and poison, fear effects better than all other classes. and no i'm not talking about a 5 point inate increase in our poison resist is called balancing us.<P>3) give us spells that at our lvs, esp at high lvs, that will be useful. i'm not talking about clerical DDs and stuff, but buffs that will stack with clerical ones, the lv 59-60 200 hp buff is a good start, but at lv 60....<P>a) soothe line of spells sould have their resistance lowered to make them useful.<P>b) buffs need to be reassesed for their usefullness. making buffs that do stack would be a very good idea imo.<P>c) why do we not get improved invis to undead?<P>d) stun line of spell needs resistance lowered a bit, due to the fact that we r getting 10-20 lvs lower clerical ones.<P>that's all i got so far. what do u paladins out there think? later</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I like the thought of giving us some buffs that stack with clerical buffs, that would be a good start, and as you said Modine, that 200 hp buff at lvl 60, lvl 60! heh.. you know what I think by the way it was said.<P>anyway, I don't agree with Modine that we shouldn't get any clerical DD's and such. AGAIN, not trying to get any of the other classes nerffed, but check this out, take a look at rangers, they get some of the druidish DD's right? now, they may say, "well, you get Gheal" yep, although I love being a tank that can heal for 300 at lvl 39 =P not like we got that much mana, I mean, when we get it at 39 it takes a bub and a half to 2 bubs of mana to cast.. and when you fizzle, WHOA. anyway, when you get to post 50, and I mean anytime before 57 when we get superior heal instead of like when you get it at 39 and you can heal a whole bub of hp, at 50+ with Gheal you can barely heal half a bub even with just your own buffs.<P>now, so as a response to rangers bout the whole Gheal thing, DD's!! and duel wield!!<P>we need the clerical DD's. it shouldn't make the other classes go beserk because any of them can outdmg us and I've already gave my opinion bout the healing crap thing. Now, bout SK's.. invis AND invis to undead, that's the first thought that comes to my mind as to why they shouldn't get mad if we get something new. another thing is their 49 quest spell, a 60% snare, that does 300 pts of dmg over 90 seconds. What do we get?! an effect added to our weapon.. not only it's just 65 pts of dmg, but I'm also pretty sure it get's resisted alot, I'm still working on the quest. does it get resisted? I'm pretty damn sure it does. Rangers get a 204 pts of dmg fire based DD that takes 2 seconds to cast. I'm not sure bout the casting dly, but it's a pretty damn nice spel anyway. <P>nuff said, peace.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>  Well, now Im depressed.  I had the idea that I was going to play a Paladin (as I do in all other role players) long before I even got the game in December.  I have taken him to lvl 16.  Now Im seriously considering retiring him.<P>  I recall when I first started playing my Paly.  When other players would ask "what class?", I proudly replied Paladin.  Usually with tear in my eye *sniff*.  Well, most people who would even choose a Paladin, as do people who play other classes, do so because the very essence of the glorious knight reflects themselves.  Truth, honor, dignity, allegiance to their god, faithfullness, justice, and so much more.<P>So I say, we are even more disgusted than most because in giving our beloved Paladins the shaft, our very way of life is being called inferior.  So sadly, I must go start my new character. probably a no class, musclehead, low IQ, drunken Warrior.  Hey, at least I wont spend 6 months investing my life roleplaying a character that reflects my values only to find utter rejection at the end. <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OK these are my ideas for paladins, to make us wanted in groups and in raids at later levels.<P>1. Better AC and defensive skill caps: OK rangers and rouges are better at offense (i.e. way more damage) so we should get defense bonus and be better at defense than these and even possibly the warrior class. Now warriors will still have more hp's than us so I dont think this will take away their tanking job.<P>2. An AoE 'Protection From Evil': I think this would make paladins VERY useful against evil npc's and plane raids. I dont have a formula worked out but an atk rating debuff for all evil mobs within the radius around the paladin. if your worried about this sounding too much like a bard type ability make it a spell (either way it'll be useful).<P>Summary:<BR>Hybrids give up melle for spells, ok i understand and suport this. However I feel hybrids should only give up half of the melee side for the spells that aren't that useful anyways. (i.e. rangers give up defensive side for their spells while keeping offensive equal or very close to the warriors, while Paladins give up offensive side for spells and keep defensive equal or VERY close to that of the warriors.) I think this WILL make wariors slightly less needed but wont make them useless like they make usa paladins now.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

VI did their so called upgrade to Paladins lol, lowered the exp we took from others but why? does that make us more acceptable to groups? why not reinstate that cause lord knows i sit around for hours to find a group so the exp we take from others sort of helps cause we can go hours even days without finding a group.....and why not give us paladins something that makes groups want us for example Chanters (mes,clarity,speed) Clerics (Buff,heal) Warriors Monks Rogues (as everyone knows deals an insane amount of damage and that means they are awesome at meleeing) and bards need work but they make a whole group better with their songs, I really think Mages and Necros have it made......I really think SKs Pallys (Rangers do the same amount of damage as other duel weilders just have to be backed by a by an alert healer)but these classes and druids are becoming obsolete i think also even though they can heal really well they still need improvements something unique that makes a group say oooh get him he can &lt;Place special/unique ability here&gt; like the chanter as I said before Mes, aug, clarity and cleric heals and buffs make us WANTED i dont know about you guys but the only time I impress someone is when I got to Kelethin or Felwithe and buff a newbie (true newbie) but even still you always see newbies asking for breeze clarity sow and what not and dont tell me its how you play your class cause when I get in groups I park if i have too stun taunt get mobs off of casters heal on downtime whatever the group needs but that doesnt mean they will take me or any other hybrid over a warrior Rogue or Monk<P>Laedain 52 paladin<BR>Tribunal <BR>Soon to be retired <BR>Paladin=Endangered species</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>In response to the kicking situation:<P> Pally can't kick because our armor is so freaking heavy that we can't lift our legs. Specially lower pallys round level 15-25 who wear bronze armor. That s*it is as heavy as hell! When I was on level 20 I thought my armor was gonna rust up and second! (We're lucky it doesn't  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/eek.gif"> )<BR>  And besides, kicking is for guys that put everything they've got into fighting like warriors and monks.

</FONT><HR>some more thoughts on paladin improvements<P>1)LoH should be changed to heal fully (ie CH) or to have the 60 min timer decreased at higher lvs<P>2)if we are suppose to be 'defensive tanks' accoding to the vision, then make us defensive tanks... increase our ac and defensive caps to equal or above that of warriors.<P>3) the 72 min reuse timer for our disaplines r awefully long, pls bring them to par with the other melee classes<P>4)why not give us natural crits to undead? without duel wield our dmg output would still be way below others.<P>5) if so then why not change santification (our crit vs undead disc) into something much more useful for us for example like upon use of disc we have a chance to STUN our target, and the stun would even include normally un-stunnable mobs like trak and others.<P>like someone said in another post, please dont think of us as 'hybrids' but rather paladins, SKs and rangers as classes unto their own. also please dont say that 'well the reason u do not get better is because u get spells'... well paladin spells at high levels r virtually useless, and totally useless for ubber mob encounters, we cannot heal well ( due to spells and limited mana), our buffs will NOT be used, the mobs r un-stunnable, lull does not work, root... i hope u see and understand.<P>6) oh yes pls add more undead ubber mobs as well.<P>that's it for now again. peace</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>Well someone started talking about rolpelaying up there somewhere and so I thought Id add a bit more to the complaints...<P>So how many people here chose to play a paladin for roleplay reason (raises hand)? I love the idea of a holy warrior dressed in a full set of shining armor, wielding a 1h and a shield, always ready to sacrifice himself in the name of good. Well, I started my paladin and I must say I lived it. I walked around doing as much good as possible healing strangers on the road, buffing people with my divine buffs etc... After a while playing I saw a person in a full set of our holy armor, the armor of Ro. All shiny and just like I always wanted my paladin to look. He told me to venture into Lavastorm and to the temple of Solusek Ro and talk to a pladin there so I vent... I got there and I had a bad feeling about it all the way... The temple oozes of evil, lava everywhere, imp guardians who looks like small devils with wings... /shrug... I actually dropped the idea of getting that armor right there. Now 25lvls later I have begun my quest for it since it is the only paladin only quest armor I will be able to get post lvl 50. But when I started the quest AGAIN I was chocked..  Not only is Solusek Ro (Semi evil) the one it is named after but you have to do horrible things to get it. You have to kill Fairies (!!!) Very honorable, especially since they are very indiffernt or even amiably to you from the start. After that you have to hack the poor gnomes clockwork robots to pieces just to get another ingredient. I would also get very pissed if someone would do that to my creations, hence we lower our faction with the gnomes.<BR>I dont want to do either but what are my choices ? Should I practise my smithing instead ?<P>Second of all...  How many in here would like to have the Epic weapon (raises hand). The Epic weapon in my eyes is the supreme goal in EQ that we all fight for and are all very proud of. Well... Let me tell you...  Every Paladin that you see with its Epic weapon is a fallen paladin. A person with so little morals in his heart that he strikes down a creature who wont attack until provoked and a FELLOW PALADIN at that just to get his weapon. Now who thinks that that is a very paladin thing to do ?  I dont...  But we ALL have to do it unless we dont want our Epics. Yes, I am talking about the Shin Lord in UGuk. He IS a paladin and he WONT attack until you start hacking up his people. And yes, we DO need the Ghoulbane to get our Epic weapon. hmmm  Why cant I see the logic in this ?  Verant has doomed all the paladins in EQ to be dishonorable and dont give me that "You have a choice" bs cause we dont. Let me QUEST for the GB and get it HANDED to me from the Shin Lord or whatever. Let me BUY melatite from the Gnomes and let me quest for or buy Fairy dust from the Fairies. And please, why did you come up with a holy armor named after Solusek Ro to start with ???? Whats wrong with the Armor of Marr ?<P>Someone will probably think, well dont kill the fairies, the clockworks or the Shin Lord...  You can BUY the stuff from other PCs that way you dont have to loose faction. Well, good idea (not). If I want to roleplay a throuh out good charachter would I want to incourage people to slay my friends ?  I wouldnt think so...<P>Anyway...  After reading all the threads in here Im about to start crying (so Im a sensitive paladin  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">.  You cannot roleplay as a Paladin and we suck in groups... hmmm  doesnt leave much room for playing a pally does it ?<P>And to add a bit about the Warrior/paladin thing...  WHY should warriors have more AC than Paladins ?  When I think of a mideival warrior I think of a tough as hell grunt with chain armor and maybe a BP. But when I think of a Paladin I think of a person in Full armor.<BR>My solution is :<P>Give the warriors ALOT more hp so that they can take alot more dmg cause that is what they should be good at. Tough hardened warriors who wont stop because of some measly fleshwound.<BR>Paladins on the other hand. We should be HARD to hit to start with since we do have large armours. Not have even close to as much HPs as a warrior but the AC should make up for it. The defense cap should be the same for warriors and Paladins.<P>That would leave a tough as hell warrior that do take alot of hits and suffer alot of HPs but with massive amounts of HPs and a crazy dmg output they could do it.<P>A paladin that takes little dmg but we dont deal enough to become a serious threat to the mobs anyway.<P><BR>And people !!!  NOWAY I would want my paladin to get DD spells that is not directed towards the undead...  We are there to protect the living and not kill them !!!<P><BR>Just my 2cp<P>/Talarion<P>What is all this about our Holy Swords, Holy Armors etc... I dont get it. To get our Epic weapon (well that is one of the goals of the game right ?) we need to:<P>-Kill a paladin who wouldnt attack us before we <BR>started killing his brethren (The Shin Lord)<BR>-Kill Fairies whom I wouldnt want to kill besides <BR>that I have to if I want to recieve my semi evil <BR>holy armor (Armor of Ro, as in Solusek Ro).<BR>-Kill Clockworks and get BAD faction with the <BR>Gnomes whom I dont know why we should have to <BR>get bad faction with !? They dont seem that <BR>evil to me...<P>There are probably more things like this that I am missing but those are a few and the things I am REALLY disturbed by. I have heard rumors saying that Verant is giving us the "choice" to kill the Shin Lord and get the Ghoulbane and the Choice not to get the Armor of Ro because of its evil nature and the fact that you have to do evil things to get hold of it. But seriously, what choices do we have? Sure I can practise my smithing skill and make myself a plate armor instead of Ro, Np. But not killing the Shin Lord ? So if I want to be a holy warrior then I am not allowed to get my Epic Weapon ? Wow, that is heck of a hard choice. Hell yeah Im gonna kill that sucker and steal his sword. So will probably most of my brothers but where does that leave us ?<P>There is NOT A SINGLE HONORABLE paladin in EQ because of this.<P>By saying that we have a choice to do the Epic quest or not, well that is really not fair. Make us QUEST for the GB instead and let the Shin Lord give it to us in reward for some great task. Sure, leave the opportunity to kill him but that atleast gives us a CHOICE. And the Armor of Ro... sigh... I dont know who came up with the idea of giving the paladins a semi evil holy armor but hey, that is a beautiful idea. Wouldnt it have been better to make it the Armor of Marr ? Wow, the armor of Marr would actually be an armor that we could all wear with pride. Solusek "if you want something you take it by force" Ro bah...<P>Well... I think I made my point... and I am probably posting this in the wrong section but hey ! Be nice this is my first post.<P>/Talarion, wannabe honorable paladin of Mithaniell Marr<P><BR>P.s. If paladins keep doing things which are bad then we are supposed to loose our powers. Hence, loose faction with a good race or person then "No more support and divine powers for you young man !" until you build up your faction again. d.s<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As much as i probably would not like to admit it, we paladins ...we suck. The hybrids themselves all could use a little help ,but by far paladins are the worst. At first its fun cuz you get a little heal and a little buff and the Wars, monks so forth are not uber yet. After a while, especially 40+ you realize that we dont cut it. I can't really think of the ways to fix us ,but i definitely see whats wrong.<P>1. We cant melee, at all. Monks,rogues, rangers etc. all do waaay more damage than we can.<BR>2. We can't tank. We dont have many HPs and low AC. Even some monks and rogues and rangers etc. have as much or more AC than myself.<BR>3.Why make us part cleric at all if all our spells are completely obsolete by the time we receive them? My pally is level 51 and i still have great healing? OK maybe this would be nice for downtime in soloin but can we solo? NO! Buffs are also obsolete, could be ok if we could solo ,but of course we cant.<BR>4. Paladins good against undead? um no. my DD currently is like 180 dmg or osmething, complete sH*t (forgot since i havent used it in so long).<BR>5. In addition to the heals and buffs, almost all our spells are obsolete. We also dont have much mana (i can only cast greater healing so many times).<BR>6. BOTTOM LINE: if paladins are part warrior and part cleric why cant we sub for either one efficiently in a group? We have nothing to offer a group and its truly sad.<P>Oh,and has anyone seen the current test server experiments? Those spell lvl switches and so forth? That made me laugh so hard when i first saw it. The only useful change was the def skill cap switch to warriors. Lets face it, they are not likely to fix us at all. They will probably continue to give us meaningless updates that embarass us. The only reason i keep playing my pally is because im stubborn, i suppose.<P>51st Cavalier<BR>Vallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hehe, this brings back memories. Let us comapre soem stuff:<P>Okay, in the pen and paper rpg world, many people love playing the paladin. Why? Cause in games like dungeons and dragons, they acuatlly are really cool to play, with special divine imunities and a telepathic link with a mount, decent clerical spell casting abilites and almsot as good as a warrior aka fighter, in combat.<P>In everquest, expecting the same thing, my first character was a pally. He turned out to be a loboamized, usless character who I promptly deleted and made a druid. Now, why would there be such a radical difference in these games, despite the obvious, when everquest was trying so hard to emulate dungeons and dragons?
