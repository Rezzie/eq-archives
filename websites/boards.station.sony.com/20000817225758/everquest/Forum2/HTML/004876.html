</FONT><HR>Gordon: In a post about you testing monks and warriors at Level 60 to see how  they stacked up against each other you said:<BR>Results: The monk outdamaged the warrior given appropriate equipment in every case. (The only time the warrior outdamaged the monk was when the warrior had his best weapon, and the monk his worst (bare knuck). ) <BR>In parentheses are what im outlining as "important"<BR>Then a paragraph later you stated:<BR>Matching up weapon-type for weapon type, the monks worst set (bare knuck) versus the warriors worst (dual ssoy's), the monk outdamaged the warrior by nearly 25%. Best versus best, the monks outdamaged by just over 25%. The lowest difference obtained for appropriate equipment was still a 20% surplus to monks. (The worst armed monk versus the best armed warrior still favored the monk by 10%.) <BR>How can the warrior out damage the monk when you say the test still favored the monk by 10%? Now..im not saying you didnt perform these tests but this "confusion" doesnt account well with it. Is Gordon trapped in a web of lies? Did he really test it? Or is he just not typing intelligently.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I disagree Gaus.  It's silly to call someone a liar without any evidence and based on a clear failure to comprehend what was stated.  No need to feign offense, for there is no evidence that he wasn't actually offended.<P>Someone started a thread about me last week claiming that I was flaming people.  I was offended for it was in error, and challenged the accuser to demonstrate when I flamed anyone.  The best part about it was when the guy posted a bunch of threads I'd posted in, I and about a dozen others pointed out that there wasn't a single "flame" contained therein, just criticism of the content of the thread.  That guy hasn't been seen since, and he used to post a few times a day.<P>One can be offended and demand proof of the allegation.  They aren't mutually exclusive.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Were Abashi , in his own spin doctor kind of way, admitted the wording of his statement was understandably misunderstood. <P>Oh oh and you ... LOL  Were even YOU, looking at the exact same wording, claimed Abashi "may have simply been in error". <P>Oh and then you go on to offer other explanations for what may have happened ! Of course if your explanations were correct then Abashi lied when he implied "he" did the tests .  Oh but you explain again how "that" wouldn't really be a lie at all. (do you feel like one of those moths knocking yourself out on the lightbulb ? your posts make you resemble one) ... <P>So before Abashi cleared the misunderstanding up it was a Lie from Mojobojo's point of view and clearly confused the hell out of you (I can not believe how desperately you went grubbing for excuses to defend him only to find out - HE REALLY DIDN'T LIE ! AHAHAHA) ..  THEN *Laughing so hard it hurts!* Abashi comes along and explains himself a ***little**** better, EVERYONE now understands but YOU suddenly decide it was a "***CLEAR**** failure to comprehend" ... Holy flip flop Batman what a ****ing joke ! <P>And Now ( I'M LAUGHING SOOOO HARD )  you suddenly knew it all along (I mean you did right ? since it was a CLEAR failure to COMPREHEND  I can not believe YOU , being as smart as you are (CAN'T STOP LAUGHING) would miss something that was so  CLEAR ! *Roaring with laughter* <P>( Must, stop, laugh, ing) * wipes the tears from his eyes* Ok, Ok, OK  so NOW ! And this is were it gets really funny... YOu are attempting to make it look like the original poster misunderstanding the exact same thing you misunderstood was somehow stupid for him and yet fail to see how you impale yourself on the same spear ! *Can't , stop, laugh, ing* <P>But does it end there ?

</FONT><HR>Gaus:  Uh, Abashi didn't say that his comment was understandably misunderstood.  He said he actually emphasized the points that needed emphasizing.  He said he understood that the confusion was accidental - not that it was understandable or "his fault".  <P>And your flame on Phelan was pretty pathetic.  Perhaps Phelan42 was defending Abashi cause - he trusts him?  Because he can think of several scenarios, and the one he finds least likely is that Abashi "got caught in his web of lies"?  I see you defend ANYONE who flames Verant REGARDLESS of their tactics (see the F U Verant thread - where you lightly slapped the wrist of the guy who was actively trying to be as offensive as possible) and completely attempt to shred ANYONE who defends Verant in ANY way.  You DON'T attempt to discuss intelligently and without flame, you defend or flame purely based on if it's pro or anti-Verant. <P>If a Verant Flamer does it... "well bud, that's not socially acceptable".  Can you imagine if that same person had been flaming those that flame Verant?  How different would your tune have been?<P>Hypocrite.<P>Qwinn Windfletcher</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>"It was blatantly blind determination to prove something regardless of how much you had to twist things."<P>Really?  And since your entire argument rests on the fact that Abashi's statement was "easily misunderstood" (I didn't misunderstand it at all - I don't think FISTS constitute "armed"), don't you think you're spinning a bit there yourself?<P>Remove the log in thine own eye...<P>Qwinn Windfletcher</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Gordon wrote: "The worst ***armed monk*** versus the best ***armed warrior*** still favored the monk by 10%"<P>I agree, Gordon, what you wrote was perfectly clear, it just doesn't reflect the reality of combat in Norrath. Its a test done in a vacuum.<P>Also, Monks shouldn't have to use weapons to maintain their edge. They should be +10% on the best armed Warrior while bare handed since they cannot hang in a "real world" battle as long as a Warrior. The only reason you have to give them weapons to maintain superiority over ultra-armed Warriors is because the game engine is flawed. Because no Monk would use a weapon unless forced to. The Discipline of the Empty Hand means bare fisted, not a pair of knuckle busters.<P>The vision of Monks at the end of beta has been drastically altered with the introduction of ultra-weapons for Monks. Before, a Monk could hold her own after a death because she wasn't dependant on equipment. I don't like the change in philosophy at all, and feel its one more demonstration of how Verant has lost control of the design, and design integrity itself. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>EQGirl:<P>That's quite a jump from 'outdamaged by 10%' to being 'unable to hold her own'.<P>Honestly, do you people read what you're writing?<P>Ponder for a second just how small 10% is.  A dime on the dollar.  But then, I suppose you expect that nothing in the universe should hit as hard as a level 60 monk.<P>Ah well... monks bluffed, Abashi called them on it.  The rest of this thread is just backpedaling.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>QwinnOfTunare: Uh you seem to have jumped right past " in his own spin doctor kind of way " . You see, you just don't understand "spin doctor" yet.<P>And it is against the Vision(tm) to admit fault for anything you can blame on the players. ( I remember a CS statement made a while back were Abashi made good use of the word "infers".) perhaps I should have said Abashi "inferred" . I'm afraid I assumed the inference was at least as obvious as the inference concerning the new CS statement a while back.<P>---------<BR>"And your flame on Phelan was pretty pathetic. "<BR>---------<BR>Flame ?  Maybe, kind'a sort'a.  Pathetic ?  SAYS WHO !?!?!   *chuckle* I'm  Hurt ..  Not .<P>I just refused to take him seriously and rightfully so.<P><BR>---------<BR>Perhaps Phelan42 was defending Abashi cause - he trusts him?<BR>---------<BR>Yes, blindly, did I not say as much ? Did my post show up in a Chinese font on your computer ? <P>----------------- <BR>Because he can think of several scenarios, and the one he finds least likely is that Abashi "got caught in his web of lies"? <BR>-----------------<BR>Did the whole post show up in a Chinese font on your screen or is this some sort of "selective  comprehension"  ?<P>And besides, are you telling me  it's bad if Abashi is called  a liar by a , a, What ? A Anti-Varent person ? But it's just peachy if a Pro-Abashi  suggests he is a  liar Caught in a  "web" of lies ?  A 'web' of lies ? Are you trying to tell me Phelan42 was suggesting (as a last resort , least likely and all that)  that Abashi was possibly  a compulsive liar with a whole web of lies  as apposed to the vile Abashi Basher's belief that Abashi told "A" lie ?  That is silly.<P>--------------<BR>I see you defend ANYONE who flames Verant REGARDLESS of their tactics<BR>--------------<BR>BS.<P><BR>-------------<BR> (see the F U Verant thread - where you lightly slapped the wrist of the guy who was actively trying to be as offensive as possible)<BR>-------------<BR>Yeah so ? your point is ? I slapped the wrist of a Varent Basher , oh but of course I'm a suspected Varent basher myself so I must somehow do more to prove myself to you ? dream on.<P><BR>-------------<BR> and completely attempt to shred ANYONE who defends Verant in ANY way. You DON'T attempt to discuss intelligently and without flame, you defend or flame purely based on if it's pro or anti-Verant. <BR>--------------<BR>Untrue. I discuss intelligently when confronted with intelligence. When confronted with uh, not intelligent,  posts I respond, , differently.<P>And sometimes when I'm not sure (as in your case) I respond with a little of both.<P>I realize there are over zealous anti-varents and over serious pro-varents. I 'usually' leave them both alone. In this I did NOT request Phelan42's attention nor his opinion but he did request mine.<P>Don't hit me with blatantly blind, drivel ridden , twisted beyond recognition , bias BS and you will find a  kinder, gentler Gaus.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004876&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004876&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
