</FONT><HR>I want to preface this by saying that i am a lvl 45 bard on Tallon zek, so aquiring a great majority of these armor pieces is a long way off, if not entirely out of my reach.<BR>What bothers me about these effects is not so much that they are not as effective or useful as i would have hoped, plenty of other class's kunark armor has effects that are not as great or useful as they would have liked.<P>What bothers me about the spell effects put on SS is that it shows a total lack of knowledge about the functionality of the bard class. Looking at the effects, there is nothing else that we bards can feel but insulted. <P>There is a difference between having spell effects that are underpowered("i have to do WHAT to be able to summon food??"), and having spell effects that demonstrate blatent disreguard and ignorance of an entire class.<P>First the effects:<P>boots: summon water<BR>greaves: summon food<BR>bracer: shield of flame(~8 point damage shield)<BR>gloves: enduring breath(water breathing)<BR>vambraces: invigor(stamina regen)<BR>breastplate: invigorate(100 point heal)<BR>helm: eye of zomm(stop laughing)<P>There are two facts to keep in mind here:<P>Fact 1: Bards sing constantly. This is because they must do so in order for their songs to continue to have effect. If you see a bard not singing, they are a)meming a song, or b)linkdead.<P>Fact 2: In order to use the effects on Singing Steel armor, a bard must stop singing.<P>With these two facts in mind, let's evaluate the spell effects.<P>gloves: Not a bad piece of armor. Nevermind the fact that i can only think of twice that i have ever had EB casted on me(both KK raids), and that we have a song that already does this. This is one of two armor pieces that gets a thumbs up, because it gives something that a bard might want to use sometime.<P>bracer: The other non-useless piece of armor. Being able to flame shield everyone in the group if there's not a mage handy is a good thing. No doubt our best spell effect. Of course, when the best kunark spell effect you have is the 8 point damage shield on your bracer, well......the problem should be evident.<P>Enough props, on to the bashing:<P>boots and greaves: Summoning food and water is nice, but giving them as spell effects on the uberarmor of a class that gets forage is just insulting.<P>eye of zomm: This would be an insult to just about any class you gave it to. Giving it to a class that can bind sight, as well as invis, sneak, and track is just ludicrous. <P>These two pieces are insults to be sure, but i can see how someone MIGHT be able to make a case for them...doubt it though. The final two pieces are the worst, and best demonstrate the ignorance of the bard class.<P>vambraces: sure, stamina regen is nice, but consider: Since level THREE, we've had a song that does a BETTER job of this, with LESS casting time, to the WHOLE group. The argument that this saves us from memming that song is invalid as well. I can mem and sing jig faster than the item's casting time, as well as the fact that i can always find a slot for jig if the tanks are needing it.<P>breastplate: A 100 point heal sounds useful, until you consider the casting time. Even if we suspend belief enough so that we could concieve of a bard obtaining this item at the minimum lvl of 45 to use it, we see that she will have no use for it. Twisting hymn of restoration and psalm of shielding at 45 with a lowly mandolin, a bard will be able to heal every member of her party faster than she could heal even 1 person with the breastplate. Not to mention the little bit of mana she will be able to throw in as well. At lvl 47, with niv's/hymn/psalm, and at 55(a more reasonable level for obtaining this item) with cantana of replenishment, the breastplate gets completely blown away.<P>Is Verant THAT unfamiliar with the abilities and song lineup of bards that it thought these effects would be useful?<P>Or did they want to insult an already much-maligned class?<P>Or is there a change in the works for SS armor?<P>-Deiko<BR>bard of the 9th page, 5th song<BR>&lt;Lineage&gt;<BR>Tallon Zek<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Dranthor, you do have to admit that the Eye of Zomm is pretty funny, though.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> That is just as bad as the FD spell on Shadowknight armor and the Snare spell on Ranger armor. <P>Wallster, while agree with you on the usefulness, or lack there of, with the spell on the Singing Steel armor, what Dranthor was attempting to say was that this is not a bard only problem. That in fact, it is a hybrid problem. Why give invigor to a bard who has a song that does it better and for more people? Why give Snare to a ranger when his level 9 snare spell casts 2 times faster and his level 51 spell casts 2 times faster, last 3 times as long, and resist about half as much? Who knows the thinking behind these questions?<P>On a side not though, the spell on the bracers (shield of flame) would not be that bad of a spell especially if it stacked with other stuff you have. Do bards have a damage shield? Not that I can remember, so this spell would not be that bad. Plus, any kind of heal on an items is good. Invigorate is not that bad of a spell, especially in a downtime reducer type of heal.<P>-Wadin Pureheart of Quellious<BR>Ranger, 52 summers<BR>Bootleggers Guild Master<BR>Possessor of the mighty ranger only snare gloves.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR> 1. Bards DO get damage shield songs. Those dmg shield songs are multi-purpose, in that they also raise resistances. <P> 2. Bard songs/buffs/healing only effect group members, so possibly VI had the idea that bards should be able to assist non-group members (thinking multi-group raids here). BUT, 100 hps? That's less than one hit by the time you can get the singing steel. (off the topic: I was hoping the Singing Short Sword would allow the bard's songs to effect non-group members inside the normal song AoE, and be equipable at the same time as an instrument... guess not)<P>  When you think "Bard" think multi-purpose. Think support. Think mana-free. Think mana battery. Copying the abilities of other classes is fine (virtually every bard song mimics some other class ability/spell... healing, snare, slow, haste, dmg shield, invis, clarity, levitate, water breathing, dots, dd, etc, etc, etc), but summoning food and water is useless, as is anything that interrupts the bard's singing/playing. <BR>  Singing steel is nice AC. That's about it. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Grildag, you still did not answer the question. Is the Damage Shield stackable. If it is stackable to your Damage Shield songs, then the spell on the bracers is a good spell. It is an additions to the amount of damage you Damage Shield can do.<P>Secondly, I would like to remind you that 100 hit point is one point greater then the heal that rangers get and is supposed to be useful. You get a 100 hit point heal that is manaless and can give you 100 points quicker then your regen song. I say again, that this spell is very useful in post combat heal situations for reducing downtime. <P>-Wadin Pureheart of Quellious<BR>Ranger, 52 summers<BR>Bootleggers Guild Master<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Talanic,<P>On the heal, that is where I have to disagree with you some. Sure you can heal with your regen song, and most likely heal a lot. But correct me if I am wrong, is it not possible to do both at the same time. What I mean is, does using the BP heal cause you to stop singing? If not, then they are very useful when used together. I have died more often because I was hurt and oom from a pervious battle and was not prepared for an unforseen attack then I have died in another method. The soon a character can recover from a battle the safer he and his group are. I believe that BP could allow you to achieve this better then if you did not have the heal there.<P>-Wadin Pureheart of Quellious<BR>Ranger, 52 summers<BR>Bootleggers Guild Master<P>PS&gt; I am not really denigning the possibility that the BP spell has not use. I do not know the specific details about the BP. So I am just asking questions about the details hoping to be further enlighten.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Actually, I'm hoping someone from Verant does read these posts. Maybe they will see that we do understand our class, and we are willing to look for a silver lining.<P>Talanic is completely correct about the healing. There is no comparison between song healing and SS healing, especially when you factor in the most important aspect of down-time, mana regeneration (and don't think about being solo, bard efficiency is insane in groups).<P>The key to this discussion of SS armor was in Wallster's original post: "Fact 2: In order to use the effects on Singing Steel armor, a bard must stop singing." Thus, the bard is crippled.<P>If you haven't played a bard (I agree with Talanic again, as I suspect many VI designers have not played a bard), then we probably can't describe to you how utterly "wrong" this armor is - with the notable exception of AC, which is quite nice. A good bard twists constantly, including during downtime. Adding keystrokes for minor effects is irrational. Anyone who has played a bard knows exactly what I mean. <P>Back to Wallster's original question. Is this an intentional insult or merely a lack of knowledge? I think SS armor is the result of a lack of knowledge. The Singing Shortsword (result of bard FA-type/particle weapon quest) shows the same ignorance.<P>The one good thing about ignorance is that it can be corrected. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000243&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000243&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
