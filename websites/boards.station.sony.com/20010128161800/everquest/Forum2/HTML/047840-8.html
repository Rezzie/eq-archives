</FONT><HR>Well Verant you have gone and done it!<P>You have announced the Death of Everquest!<P>By implementing these changes you will make the game easier to level. In doing so you will also make it so people loose interest faster.  Sure at first everyone will love the changes but when they get there character up to level 60 then what? Create a new character, which you will be able to level to 60 in a fraction of the time it used to.  People will get bord real quick of that.  As your current player base drops off because of lack of interest you will not be able to refresh it quick enough. Hence Everquest will die.<P>My only question is why? Are you planing to release another version of Everquest? Maybe EQ 2 is close to being released and you want to bring this game to a close so you can <BR>   A) Get us to buy a new game<BR>   B) Charge us more for the new game<P>I know that I for one will be leaving everquest after my present characters have reached 60 (or maybe before)  As it will be pointless to create another character after that!  <P>Congradulations on the Death of an Empire!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>hehe 60 won't be that easy bro, just ask a rogue how long it took to get 60.<P>Death of EQ?  Not likely.<P>Great changes to the EXP.  Playing a monk, I will like the fact that my 20% extra is gone, especially once all the balancing fixes for the classes are complete.  No sense having a class-based penelty when all classes will be balanced in upper levels.<P>Also, I am glad that groups will no longer suffer other people's EXP penalties.  That never made sense anyway, and I am glad it will be gone.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I only have one question per se ... on this particular statement:<P>Quote:<BR>Now you'll notice that we are dividing up experience based upon the level makeup of the group. For instance, if a level 20 and a level 21 group together, the level 21 will get more experience per kill. That is however only fair since the level 21 does actually contribute more value to the group. Unquote:<P>But is this based on an OFFENSIVE figure, or a TOTAL figure. Because I could be a 20 Warrior and a 21 Bard, and the 20 Warrior would do more damage than the Bard, with a song, unless it had the Horn skill (un-nerf'd) top'd and using DDD, for example, when it might get closer to the reality.<P>These ideas are great, and I can finally say ... thanks, this Bard may return to work and drop the Shadow Knight ... but in some ways, this still would punish some if their "damage" is not measured on anything else but Offensive output. Considering that this game, in Kunark and Vellious specially, has become a tank's delight, even with these penalties adjusted some, I still see that I could not get as much as a Bard as the Warrior can of like level.<P>Can we factor in the DEFENSIVE abilities? So a Shaman, or someone that does Debuff's can acutally gain for their "improvement" in the battle. I just feel really sad, when reading information that "Dr00ds" ___k" and "Bards are worthless", and many other comments ... I love grouping with "Dr00ds" and have had good luck with them, but they do get resisted way too often, from 40 on ... (not in Butcherblock - that's for sure!) as do the Bards.<P>I would not have minded the "penalties", although I appreciate the adjustments. I would imagine that to me, the more visible penalty is the number of songs that are broken, and do not work. Why not, for example, place a level restriction on Lullaby ... like 23 (whatever). Why not place a level restriction on X and Y ... instead of adding the secondary resistances and such that pretty much disable the songs?<P>My thought is, and I can relate to this since I am no young ganimede out there, that things change. The ideas that you had a year and a half ago, prior to Kunark, no longer apply and some details need to be adjusted for the good of the dis-satisfaction that runs amuck in your boards. In past days, when we looked at one phone call in the radio station I was close to, we called that "100 listeners" (and joked about "losteners, too! - don't get me wrong!), and that means that we had to be a little more carefull with the disatisfaction ... and that attitude took us all to #1, and kept us there! Still there 25 years later, which tells you something.<P>I don't know that EQ can last that long, and I think that you and I both would probably love to see you get gray hairs and beards with it. Unlikely, but we can dream, right? But I do feel that one of the major things that could be addressed is just such a thing and a balance that is not an "imaginary" sheet, but a reality that is clear in the class/player distribution.<P>You know what I find weird? Ask FoH, and all other Uber Guilds ... which class they would start for a secondary, and almost all of them will choose a "tank", or a "wank" ... and rarely will they choose the classes that add to the DEFENSE, or other aspects of the game ... and I find this sad. There should be an ABSOLUTE need for a Bard, a Cleric, Enchanter, Shaman, and Druid ... and there should be (this ought to be fun) a Dragon, that can only be killed, IF ALL CLASSES are in the room (we don't tell this to anyone of course! FoH would be the last one to find out how to bust that one -- LOL (don't know, just kidding) ... just so all classes are needed, in the fight, and to acquire some major loot.<P>You have a great game. Just make ALL your classes important and valuable and it will be a very difficult game to leave. You still have the best Bard, although I am still officially "On Strike" with Union 629 (you know the bunch) -- but for me, it has been mostly because earlier on, it was fun, and we could use the songs. Now it is not, and things can only be done if you have some equipment.<P>And for once ... notice the reaction to your reasonable effort at being honest. Plz let this be a clue to how you should be in Customer Service ... and then let's go to 400k!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

While i am only lvl 14, i have watched human warrior frinds with WAY less kills in BB than me level faster, i have been playing sooo many extra hours trying to stay caught up, now i will be on equal footing at last!<P> and as far as those catacombs under Qeynos, color me out of Black Burrow and in the Catacombs first thing Wednesday evening after i get off work. he he  TRAIN TO ZONE he he man i could just kiss you guys.......<P>                Nazgaroth<BR>                Ranger of the 14th Season<BR>                Drinal Realm<BR>                &lt;Blade and Might&gt;<P>"hey big man, lemme hold a dollar"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Other than that a group or two at the entrance.

</FONT><HR>I am all for the changes and am glad to see the game isn't set in stone and that drastic changes can still happen.<P>I do hope that these changes are not the "solution" to all of the problems and that you are still indeed looking into some problems which still exist in the areas of balancing risk vs reward.<P>Two problems:<BR>1.  Lesser used dungeons.  Although a better reward for some dungeons sounds great in theory, I still hope you are going to revisit some of the dungeons in terms of loot/items and spawns.<BR>-Examples, paw, befallen and najena.<BR>Paw:  I personally won't ever go back to paw due to the fact one enchanter gnoll killed my full party of 6 because of charm.  Nobody even saw him coming due to the fact he was casting at extreme range (around the corner somewhere) and was an accidental pull.  I have a real problem with this dungeon having monsters which can charm half a party hidden behind a wall.  And for the most part this is what keeps all parties which gain exp in this dungeon restricted to areas before the double doors.  If you have been there you know what I mean.<BR>Befallen and Najena.  Soul bound keys.  Orc camps fulfill the need for a group but don't require hours of camping for keys.  And dying behind a locked door, specially one a rogue can't unlock, is a huge penalty.  And neither of these dungeons offers substantial reward to players in their apropriate range.<P>2.  Class balance.  I hope that you don't consider all matters regarding classes closed.  There are definetely some issues regarding class which should still be examined.  I am only refering to same class, different race combinations.<P>Examples:<BR>Dark elf rogue vs any other type of rogue.  This is due to the fact dark elves rogues have lower melee stats.<BR>Iksar Warrior vs any other type of warrior.  Lack of midlevel armor capable of keeping iksar AC comparable to other warriors.  I understand highest level armor is available to them, that isn't the point.<BR>Human druids vs other types.<BR>Human casters vs other types.<P>Basically I am looking back to what you did with erudites and how you gave them "quests" for higher level items which made up for some drawback of the class.  Lack of quests for all levels applies to all classes however.<P>My final comment is this.  Please revisit stats with the same vigor you have shown the experience penalty.  A huge aspect of the game, mainly stats being useful, is underutilized and I would love to see it worked out in more detail.<P>My example:  Casters collect Int/Wis gear because it drastically changes the size of their mana pool.  However strength doesn't drastically change the damage output of a melee class.  I'm suggesting you be creative here.  Here are a few suggestions.<P>Strength effects the minimum damage a character can do with any given hit (maximum remains).  Things to remember, make it a sliding scale that takes into account strength/delay/damage.<P>Dexterity effects off hand damage, Proc rates and 2nd hit (from double attack).<P>Agility effects parry, dodge, riposte and additionally once a certain level is reached a player can decide to lower melee damage in favor of "deflecting" incoming damage.  Thus allowing tanks to tank longer.<P>Stamina drastically effects hp gain.  On the order of 10-15 hp per stamina point above 100 at level 60.<P>This is a fairly drastic change and would defintely take more thinking then what I have put down in this simple post.  But my idea is that players can customize what they want their class to do.  This would also make buffs by shaman or other casters much more important at higher levels (and lower).  To the point where players may actually consider buying potions/buffs the same way they buy sow.<P>This game leaves a lot to be desired in terms of allowing a player to customize their character more.<P>Examples for trade skills.<BR>1.  Allow tailoring to change the "skin" of cloth (robes), leather.  You collect a dye potion and change any robe (players can pick the robe with the stats they want) and change it to whatever skin they want.  You would need to pick "common" skins (like solid colors), and "rare" skins so people aren't running around with the SMR look on their gossimer robe.  This would allow guilds to colorize, players to choose their appearance and give you a whole sleu of additional items to place in the game.  Remember though, this trade skill should have 0% chance of taking away the item (though you can lose the dye).  Think more in terms of "player satisfaction" since this doesn't add any stats to the game.<P>Blacksmithing should be able to do the same.  Why restrict dyes to fine steel plate when they could color any armor they want.  And additional find high level mobs with dyes to make other skins.<P>The bottom line is don't stop working towards your vision.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>In general I would applaud the changes VI is making.  However I was curious as to how this "fixes" overcrowding??  Sure.... now my twink knows what and where to hunt but who really cares about that when LOWER GUK, SEBILIS and KARNORS look more like a New York Subway at rush hour and CITY OF MIST, CHARDOK and HOLE look like a ghost town?<P>The 45plus community is literally pigeon-holed into the main dungeons (LG, Karnors and Sebilis).  Why do people concentrate in these main 3... um loot silly, plain and simple.  The other less utilized dungeons (Chardok and CoM) have mediocre/weak loot but the PATHING is so attrocious as to scare even the bravest of pullers (Hole is actually pretty good in this respect. The Hole has its own set of problems... why would a tank want to get a pickup group in the HOLE?!?! When its time to leave he would have to be ported out thanks to the one way ledge (there are resourseful ways of "beating" that, thx /duel with caster casting Gflux).  Hmmm... and exactly how does the druid/wiz get back in the group if there is no Mage with COH or a wiz to toss the tank to his bind point which I HIGHLY doubt he would enjoy?  I guess the point is, why deal with all the extra hassle?<P>You have certainly made a step in the right direction regarding experience and how it is distributed but this isnt going to fix the overcrowding in the 45plus community.  Fix pathing and adjust the loot tables in the underutilized dungeons a bit (not godly but equal).

</FONT><HR>Dark_Tyger,<P>Unfortunately you are wrong.<BR>For example:<P>A human Cleric kills mob 01 and gains 100 XP and needs 1000 XP to level.  Therefore he needs to kill 10 mobs.<P>A human paladin kills the same mob and gains 140 XP and needs 1400 XP to level.  Therefore also needing 10 kills.<P>A human warrior kills  the same mob and gets 100 XP (NOT 90 XP) and needs 900 XP to level.  Therefore he needs just 9 kills.<P><BR>What SHOULD BE so that all are equal and no one can cry nerf:<P>Cleric kills and gets 100*1.0/.9 = 111 XP.  Needs 9 kills to level<BR>Paladin gets 100*1.4/.9 = 156 XP.  Needs 9 kills to level<BR>Warrior gets 100*0.9/.9 = 100 XP.  Needs 9 kills to level<P>Simple.  Easy. Quick. <P>AND FAIR!<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;So now people who used to have large exp penalites to offset their general usefulness in a group will in fact be leveling FASTER than Monks? I was somewhat happy while reading the post til I got to this... just another great reason to be an Iksar Monk instead of a human I guess. /rantoff<P>No, Ogre's will be leveling faster than Human Monks USED TO.  Human Monks will be leveling faster, too.<P>Great changes, thanks Verant.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
