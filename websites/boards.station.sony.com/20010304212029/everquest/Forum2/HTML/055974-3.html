</FONT><HR>Ok here goes.....<BR>I really do not want Angel form to be travel only, as a cleric it sucks to be in LFG mode for an hour and then have to log.  Keeping in line with the other priest class the druid, who gets an attack bonus, haste, sow, and I think some other things (all the Druids reading this please correct me if I am wrong); Clerics with Angel Form should get:  Lev, Holy Speed, Standing Med, and an ATK bonus so we can actually hit something.  We are a plate wearing class who cannot fight anything melee.  We get one of the best epic weapons in the game.... but we can't hit the broad side of a planet.  I pay $10 dollars a month to PLAY EQ, not MED EQ.  Why should a cleric be the only class who can't go solo when he can't find a group??<P>Sorry reading this board has made me forget that I am a cleric.  I shouldn't whine...

</FONT><HR>Dont know if this has been posted or not, but there is a lot of controversy about healing abilities atm.<P>One thing that is inefficient is complete heal.  It heals 10k hps.  The most any player can hope to have (warriors) is around 5k.  The cap is there to keep mobs with 32k+ from starting fresh 5 or 6 times.<P>New Spell:  Complete Heal over time.  Return 1k hps per tick for 10 ticks (1 minute).  Have a long recast delay (30-60 seconds).  Make it level 60. Leave the mana cost and casting time same as complete heal since it is the same thing, just drawn out.  It would be a buff, so its not like 3 clerics can cast it on someone at the same time.  Don't let it stack it other heal over time (celestial healing etc) but still stack with regular regen spells.<P>Means when the cleric is lagging, the tank may still live on mobs that hit for 500+.  Means the cleric can do other things like stun/melee on non uber encounters.  <P>This is still the same amount of healing as complete heal, just allows the players to take full advantage of the benefits of complete heal, and puts any doubts of clerics healing abilities out.<P>Malase<BR>55 shaman</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Norrathian Dictionary Reference for Cleric:<P>Main Entry: Cleric<BR>Pronunciation: Cl'air'ik<BR>Function: noun<BR>Etymology: Middle Norrathian cleric, from Old Norrathian kler'ik, ultimately from Late Antonican presbyter -- more at PRESBYTER<BR>: one authorized to perform the sacred rites of a religion especially as a mediatory agent between inhabitants of Norrath and their God(s); specifically : an Antonican, Dwarven, Elven, Gnomish or Erudite clergyman ranking below a bishop and above a deacon (note, we do not recognize as clerics, the practitioners of dark healing arts that are part of the fell races - kobolds, orcs, etc)<BR>;healer, protector of the faithful<BR>;dispenser of divine wrath<P>Ok, so my argument starts with the premise that Clerics are healers/buffers, and that their secondary function is dealing with infidels (as compared to their faith) by bringing down their God's divine wrath.  By comparison, Paladins are more the justicars of their faith, generally roaming the countryside and using their God-given prowess as a fighter to deal with brigands and the like - they receive some divine powers to support them in their quests, but their primary ability lay in their martial skills.  A paladin is expected to be more martial in bearing, and able to deal with more "wordly" issues, whereas Clerics first function in life is definately as a healer, but when circumstances warrant, they should be able to deal with more "other-worldly" adversaries (undead, arcane) with the powers their God has granted them.<P>Taking this to the game setting, we see that Clerics currently are the foremost healers in the world.  Shaman and Druids are no where near as functional in that regard.  On the other hand, Clerics have no reasonable expectation of being able to solo effectively - not that they should necessarily - but when you start talking about granting better healing powers to these other classes, you definately need to take this into account.<P>As it stands right now, the MAIN reason you take clerics on UBER raids is to ressurrect people.  Healing is certainly nice, but in general the cleric is there to res.  Reducing downtime CAN be accomplished through healing, but it can also be accomplished with enchanters mezzing, shamans slowing, using pets to tank, etc - and with Druids and Shaman you get healing as well.  So if you look at it in that light, a cleric is already somewhat redundant in a party setting, again, mainly brought along to perform res.  The res ability is more in demand for when you are in a zone that there is no easy way out of (Veeshan's Peak, etc), but also for going deep into zones that you don't want to have to fight your way back into.  You will see on many raids Clerics are told to camp (Fear, Hate, etc) when things go bad, so they can come back after everything has settled to res people back in.  Giving summon corpse to necros and SK has somewhat mitigated this dependency, as well as giving paladins the ability to perform res.<P>Based on all of this, I would like to suggest the following:<P>1. Clerics should be given some more effective damage-wise 1-shot nukes - ie they should have a nuke as powerful as, or more powerful than, ice comet but the recast time should only allow its use 1 in a game day.  Probably the magic type could be different based on the God they follow (thus gving some reason to follow different Gods) so that some clerics might be cold-based, some fire, some poison, etc.  This would be considered their "Divine Wrath" type spell that they could receive a version of at 51, (maybe another at 55) and 60 that would require a quest through their temple to receive.  Also make it so I cannot use this nuke on creatures of my God.<P>2. On a similar thought to the first item, make it so I can not cast damage spells on creatures that worship my God.... hmm... not sure what the implementation of this one would cause, it is just a thought.<P>3. Invis - common request, maybe at 34th or 39th you can give Clerics self-only invis (and see invis) so they can get around to perform their res function a little easier.  You already give necros DMF at 44th which as a spell, has little to do with their class (not that that is justification for this, just precedent) - it seems emminently reasonable to give Clerics invis at higher level, and probably not much of an imbalance issue.<P>3. Possibly make a temple quest spell available in the mid levels to give the cleric some form of short burst mana regen ability.  Call it Divine Meditation - the Cleric is stunned for 30 seconds (they are meditating) and gets back maybe 30 percent of their mana from the spell, recast every 10 minutes.<P>4. Concerning Stuns - make the stun component less resistable, but allow the damage to be resisted independently - just don't stop the stun if the damage is resisted.  I would just like my stuns to work, but the only one that does consistently is the level 5 stun... seems kind of strange in the grand scheme of things that my higher level stuns are less effective....  In any case, this is one of the Clerics secondary functions - seems funny to give me 4 levels of a stun spell only to make them almost useless post 50.<P>5. It seems Clerics should be MORE effective verus undead, but there is really nothing in the game that makes that true.  All other classes that currently are better in martial and damage dealing abilities are better than Clerics at dealing with undead.  Cleric's pre-50 undead spell costs a little less than Reckoning and does less damage - its main claim to fame being almost instant recast, but then we hardly get to use them because we are (pre-50) there to heal most of the time (assuming giving better heals to Shaman/Druids would allow Clerics more lattitude to nuke).  Seems like our undead damage could be upped considerably, as there are few post 50 undead that we have to deal with on a regular basis.  If Clerics are master undead nukers, they should receive an Ice Comet level undead nuke at 44th or 49th that is only usable on undead.  Maybe as a reason to even have undead nukes, you make it so that nukes not specifically tailored to undead only do 75% of their normal damage.  Again, that would make it more desirable to have a cleric in a group earlier on when dealing with undead, and you aren't totally wanting a cleric just to res.  Give the undead nukes normal cast recycle times.<P>I think if you looked at implementing some, or all, of these ideas it would help give Clerics a more effective purpose to being in the game other than just primary res and healing/buffing.  I think these ideas would also be good as offsets if you intend to give better heals to Shaman and Druids.  At least if you give Shamans and Druids better heals, Clerics might actually be able to be a bit more offensive in groups than they currently are - I don't think anything I suggested here would be unbalancing, especially with the low number of undead encounters at UBER level - kinda nil at this point.  Also, I think these changes would help with the boredom most clerics are seeing at higher levels and definately in post-50 play.<P>CONCERNING MATERIAL COMPONENTS:<P>1. Any spell that requires a material component to cost should have a very long duration.  Lev = bat wing; End breath = fish scales; Symbols = cat's eye, jasper, peridot; etc.  Currently the duration of most of these spells is VERY short compared to the fact you need a material component.  Then at 44th level you give Necro's DMF that lasts forever and gives lev/breath/poison resist/see invis with NO material component.  Even the mana cost isn't that significant.  Any spell with a material component should last at least an hour most likely.  Look at pets - they have some of the cheapest casting components around, yet they last forever unless they are killed or you zone - although the Cleric pet spell is just DUMB  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> (see, enchanters don't have the worst pet in the game anymore).<P>-OR-<P>2. Material components should be CHEAP.  Peridots should cost maybe 1pp to 2pp each at most and price others accordingly and then leave the spell durations alone.<P>BUFFS/CURES:<P>As it is for a Cleric, the AC buffs cost a large amount of mana for the benefit received, so the long duration is based on mana instead of a component.  The HP/AC buffs are cheaper, and some have good duration, that is fine since the principle buff a Cleric can give is HP.<P>It does make some kind of sense that as a Cleric I would be able to abolish poison AND disease... <P>Regen seems best left to Druids and Shaman - they are the nature guys  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>PETS?:<P>Speaking of the Cleric pet spell - can we like, get rid of it or something?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  The idea was kinda cute, but I can't even parade it around as a parlor trick - it just pops.  If you could give it a few more hps that would be great, you could make it material component based - I need a certain type of hammer to summon it, but then make it so it doesn't pop immediately, or, if I can retarget a bad guy within 10 seconds it can fight that creature....?  I dunno, my first thought is just get rid of it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>My 20cp</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Thank you for the oppurtunity for me to tell the developers what I think should be changed about clerics. I enjoy playing my 38 cleric, however there are some things that I think should be changed.<P>First of all, charisma based spells.<BR>    I don't think this is just a rumor, but I have no factual evidence to support that charisma affects spells. If it does, then dwarves and halflings will not be as good of a race choice as High Elves. I do understand that High Elves have low Strength to offset this, however this can be easily overcome. There are very lightweight robes that High Elf clerics can wear, and dwarves and halflings can't. Also, since they start out with such high wisdom to begin with, they can put their points into strength. It was never stated that clerics would rely on charisma for so many spells, and is unfair to find out this far into the game that it does. For RP reasons, clerics should have high charisma. The definition of charisma is the ability to attract followers. Hmm, sounds like a priest to me. Heh, how many merchants would really stiff a priest?<P>Resists<BR>     This may be do to my previous point about having low charisma. However, my non-healing spells are resisted almost to the point of being useless (lull series actually is). Was this intended? When you are relieing on a stun to interupt a caster, and your clerics stun is resisted more often then not. You won't rely on that cleric. I think that interupting fits in line with the clerics job of protecting the group. And it diversifies us beyond the med/heal routine.<P>Peridots<BR>     I can not cast the new symbol spell yet. However, from grouping with higher level clerics, it seems like twinks can afford to cast these and thus are more usefull to a group.<P>Bandaging<BR>     Many others have expressed many good ideas and reasons on why bandaging should be a productive tool for us to use, and I agree. Medding while bandaging seems like a good idea.<P>AoE Healing<BR>     The heal just doesn't do enough to be efficient except in uncommon situations. Make it heal about %50 more.<P>Invisibility<BR>     I can not afford to keep purchasing invis potions. While I applaud others achievements in being able to twink their cleric, I don't think the rich should be able to travel and get to their groups more efficiently then the people who can't/chose not to twink their cleric. This is similar to JBoots in that members of uber guilds get jboots through multi questing, while everyone else gets left in the dust. A self invisibility would fit in nicely.<P>Travel<BR>     Clerics can't travel well. I rely on my group desirebility to get people to invis and sow me. I believe we should get some type of enhancement here, be it self invis, port to deity, live man gloating etc.. I can't elaborate on why without comparing my skills with that of other classes in light of the proposed future changes. I made up my mind to not dilute my message with any class envy. Race envy yes, but not class envy.<P>Ressurections<BR>     I would not object to getting a better res at level 39. The one I will get restores too little exp, so most people just log their alts on for it. With the age of my server, alt clerics are widely available. Would you rather see someone log on their camped alt high level cleric to res a group or someone playing their mid level cleric as their main do that res? MAybe make the 39th one restore 75%. Most groups would accept my res instead of waiting for their friend's alt to log on, and will still give me something to look forward to 49. With the availibility of high level resses, the 39th one just isn't good enough.<P>Flying<BR>    When clerics are levitated, give them the swimming animation.<P>While considering these changes, please don't base your decision off of the high level uber equiped clerics. Not every cleric is twinked, and those who aren't should not be overly substandard.<P><BR> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>i dont see the shaman/druid heals being a problem really.  because, they dont want to play the cleric. it is too boring for them.  i have died in a group before with a druid and asked him "why didnt you heal me?". his reply was i didnt have it memed.   i dont think the healing being better will change their attitude towards the boring task of being the healer.  where this does come into effect is in their soloing.  they were good at it before now they are insane.   well if i could solo 2 before now i can solo 3 or 4.  when i get beat up to badly the healing isnt going to waste all my mana.<BR>this also comes into effect pvp.  i play on the RZ server.  this is where you get a real sence of what classes are better than others.  most pk's are druids, and they are very successful.  but now with better healing they will be near impossible to beat.  not that a cleric ever could beat one, but now even the other classes will have a hard time.<BR>i am all for the other classes getting better healing, in fact make it so good that the cleric doesnt always have to be the main healer.  but give us some major enhancements in return.  many wonderful ideas have allready been put out there.  we havnt heard any responses that sound like we are getting anything at all, and definatly nothing major if they do decide we get anything</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Guys lets not forget the lower lvl's too! <P>Compared to the Druids and Shamans... Clerics are broken from lvl 14-up.  Let's try to get an Undead-only Snare around lvl 19, Self-only ports back to our home temple only around lvl 29, maybe the Anglic Form around lvl 39, ect....<P>We need to also see cleric's take back the role of Undead Hunters.  At lvl 25 I have major problems trying to hunt single blue undeads, BLUES!  No other class that I can think of has problems hunting blues, fully healed and med to full!!!!<P>my 2000cp worth ( because I feel that strongly about it )<P>PS: If clerics are so balanced, why are there so few Clerics and so many Druids?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>In many ways I think the cleric is balanced. I have PVP'd enough and grouped enough to know everyone has limitations, frustrations and useless spell lines.<P>I am going to address an avenue prolly no-one will aggree with but for me it would make the class more viable in my mind. Also this post jumps all over the place so stayed FOCUSED!<P>Clerics are healers and a tough SOB universaly. In most games they are allowed to wear armor and almost be in the front line of battle. Their strenhghs are healing, combat and and weaker emphasis on offensive power. I know most clerics see no need or do not melee but as a cleric they should be able to take more hits, and deal more hits then any of thier casting breatheren &lt;as thye do,, however&gt; /I dont even like to call them casters,, Clerics are battle casters of thier god. <P>Melee must be more viable for Clerics ,, to some extent. Many times I have been grouped with nothing but casters, Whose the tank? Me obviously,.<P>Possible Melee enhancing additions<P>Give Clerics an inate resistanse of 5 or 10 % to Poison and Disease &lt;obvious to me&gt;<P>Give CLeric Bash or Kick or some form of 2nd attack line ,but make it weaker than Paladin and SK's&gt; &lt;Been holding a shield so Damn long and I dont even know how to knock someon off the head with it?&gt;<P>Since it is reasonable that clerics only get 1h and 2h bash give clerics a self only Attack buff or two &lt; "Holy Might" cast upon weopon that add's +2 damage for a set duration,, or a Speed buff?&gt;<P>Less resists on Nukes and more stick with root?<P>Just tweaking some Off and Def statistics would make a cleric able to fend off greens and possibly solo some low LVL Blues past lvl 25ish, as well as tank when neccesary for the robe wearing classes. I know as a cleric I would feel a little less naked. As of now I can heal, nuke my mana away, take a few hits and run like hell from blues. Soon it became really hard to Solo blues after 20 and if  my nukes got resisted or halved, my roots stopped sticking and my mana was going down faster than the mobs HTP. <P>It's not only action time that clerics can be balanced it's the in between time and odd times that we are useless. I am quite happy in groups as we are now healing, getting a few wacks in and keeping the party and people alive. I have accepted my role in groups and my abilities in PVP.  I want more fun/balance outside of this time. I want to be a CLERIC not a HEALING BATTERY 24/7. I want to when solo or running with a robe wearer to get in some mobs faces bash/stun , heal, root at reasonable levels. I am a CLERIC! At no time would I ever kid myself that I should be meleeing instead of medding my heal in a group if I had this extra flexibility.<P><BR>Question...Why do spells become less reliable as you go higher even whem the mob's are still lower than you? Should there be some sort of balance that remains? <P>Heal, tank, utility spells, offensive casting, thats what a cleric's balance should look like.<P><BR>Then a cleric will be just like a Paladin with better heals you say? Paladin's need some damn help I think, don't diss what a cleric should be because the Paladin is hurting. Paladin's are nice but ***** foot Melee and Casting to much, Paladin's themselves need to either be better <BR>melee wise or have more OFFENSIVE god given spells &lt;Cleric Nukes :P and not to much later.&gt;<P><BR>&lt;Give Paladins alot of my offensive Casting power keep his healing weak and increase my Melee/defensive power. Paladins ARE the Holy MIGHT of thier God, Paladins are !!!Melee,OFFENSIVE CASTING, HEALING,utility spells!!!&gt; &gt;<P>As for the other hybrids I dont think there as bad off as the Paladin and because Paladins directly connect to cleric I only mentioned that class.<P><BR>I like my group role,allow me to have more melee flexibility outside generic groups.<P>Ehrose-</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This whole class Discussion has brought up a question.<P>Twice now (once from Abashi and once from Absor) I have read "Clerics get a healing bonus".  If this is so I have not seen it.  I am going to test and see if a 29 shaman casting GH heals the same HP as a 29 cleric casting GH.  50% of the time below level 34 we have the same heal spell ability as druid and shaman.  If we get a bonus what is it?<P>I am curious now and I am going to test but I am sorry if it is 10% better heal for same mana does verant honestly feel that offsets the limitations and weaknesses enforced on the cleric class?<P>I love my cleric and I am determined to force this through.  I started this character knowing my guild would need clerics.  I am one of two Clerical Mains.  We have alot of people that have made clerical alts and are trying like mad to power level them to 39.  Most of them are making high teens or 20 and hitting a wall.  By 25 they are wondering why and complaining about the boredom and difficulty in finding a group in their level range for good xp.<P>  Not counting ports in spell totals the only class with fewer spells is Wizzies they have 135 spells (plus 12 ports 7 evacs and 1 imbue)  Clerics have 146 spells plus the imbues which each cleric can cast one of.  That means clerics have 20 fewer spells than the next class.  20 Spells that is 5 lines of spells at the normal 4 spells per line type basis.  Could some of those be filled in to add some depth and ability to clerics?<P>People say we are the master of undead but in truth our undead abilities only occaisionaly exceed the abilities of others vs anything.  Our undead DD line is directly mirrored by Druid Summoned only DD line spell for spell, level for level.  Does that make druids "master of summoned creature bashing"? (note not a druid flame just sort of comical since I know no one thinks like this.)<P>Many will say clerics are fine.  I personally believe that clerics have been so narrowly defined and implemented that it has created a balance issue.<P>Tfodthog Tmfof<BR>26 Cleric of Brell</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>well it all depends on what Absor comes up with.<P>If we get nothing time to be a paly or druid.<P>What class to play, stay true to your roots and be a paly or have a bit of fun and be a Druid.<P>If I could just have a bit more fun and be able to travel without gritting my teeth. The ability to to do something in 3 hours without a group( no, I am feed up with swimming in circles or casting my lvl 1 heal spell to get my specialisation up).<P>Does not sound too much to stay a cleric....<P>I don't care that the people I grouped with when I was lvl 20 are now 10 to 15 lvls higher than I am now. It just that when you had a list of friends you use to be able to send tells to get in a grp, are now out of reach. So you alwas have to build up a new circle of people(and that takes time).<P>I am lvl 31 cleric and looking forward to this great experience of post 50 gaming. But I don't think it will be with a cleric, it is hard work if you only ever play in 3 hour chunks. <P>I have no alternate, I have only ever played a cleric, but I have a feeling it is about to change.<P>The question is will Absor save this cleric and keep him playing???</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I posted up an idea about mana-regeneration earlier. It should be self-only, and since we have already got spells requiring a component, I don't feel troubled when these mana-regeneration spells cost a component to cast. This will make sure (depending the price of the component) it is only used in situations when quick mana recovery is of the essence.<P>Furthermore, higher defense skills are paramount. We take a lot of beating when the MOBs agro on us, and we don't have the AC-bonus that the fighter classes get (and I think this includes the Ranger). Furthermore, our offensive capabilities are fine I guess ... they should not be improved.<P>Yes, we can use shields, but not bash. Give us bash, I'd say. I don't need double attack or parry.<P>Lower fizzle rate on ALL 50+ spells - not only Cleric spells - and have MOBs also fizzle them from time to time. Also, decrease magical resist on most MOBs, or make spells harder to resist. Ever since Velious came out, caster classes have become second-grade to melee classes in those high-end encounters.<P>Give us Group buffs, next to the single ones. We are the backbone of the group, but we seriously lack in group buff spells.<P>Gate to Home Temple ... I'm willing to quest for it!!<P>Give us the ability to solo ON OCCASION, when we FEEL like it. Most other classes can, Clerics have serious problems here. The text for most green-conning mobs should read "looks like it would wipe the floor with you!" at 50+, instead of you having the upper hand. This solo-ability comes automatically when numerous of the above abilities have been included.<P>Switch Undead-only DD with general DD spells, and make them somewhat more powerful.<P>Unlike others, I don't mind seeing spells that indirectly hamper an Undead in its abilities (debuffs, snare, etc...). Introduce more Undead creatures, especially at the higher levels! If I understand correctly, Velious has NO undead Mobs!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I see little point in continuing to post cleric suggestions to this board.  It is pretty obvious that Verant has turned a deaf ear to clerics concerns.  Since Kunark was released, every change made affecting clerics has been negative.  Verant either reduces our abilities to the point of near uselessness or they give it to another class further reducing our effectiveness.<P>While it is nice to try and keep a positive attitude in life, there comes a time when all of us must accept reality.  For me the reality is that the cleric class is too specialized now.  This was acceptable when we were rewarded for that specialization because we enjoyed a unique niche in EQ.  Verant has continually erroded that niche to the point where the only thing clerics have going for them is Complete Healing useful only when healing players with more than 2000 HPs (realistically they need over 3000 for a margin of error and lag), and getting experience rezzes earlier than Paladins and Necros.  <P>Lately a level 39 rez and even a 49 rez are not desireable.  Ironically, clerics are one of the few classes that compete against themselves.  If a player can get a 56 rez, they will decline a 49 rez.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>There are two big pictures to consider here.<P>The first is balancing group desirability and soloability.<P>We are the masters of group desirability. Even the healing changes to shamans and druids won't change this. It will mean that sometimes we will go LFG for longer because some of the groups in the zone already took a druid or shaman rather that wait for us to wander in. So be it. <P>We all know that we can't solo to save our lives. Killing 3 very light blues per hour, if we're lucky, running from them because the make a couple resists and we can't finish the fight when we're unlucky, is no way to solo for advancement in the game.<P>The issues we need to focus on, then, are issues that make us stronger when not grouped.<P>Of course, Verant has already stated that this is a grouping game and they will be reluctant to consider any enhancements to a classes solo viability, so we're probably SOL on asking for soloing enhancements, but that is where we need them<P>Some things that help us when not in groups:<P>Better spells vs. undead, particularly our undead DD line. Did you realize that at 49th level, wizards can do 2x as much damage to undead as clerics of the same level with fewer resists? Undead DoTs would help, too. And not that crappy SoV 39th spell that nobody can find and those who are lucky enough to find it, usually well into their mid-40s, don't use it because Banish Undead is far, far superior in damage output and mana efficiency.<P>This might help in groups in, say, Lguk. But even there, I am often busy enough healing that I won't be nuking the undead often enough to matter. Except when I am stuck lfg and decide to solo a few blues while waiting for a group.<P>Traveling spells will help us find groups, get to groups, and possibly help us solo. It would be nice, after burning a sand giant to the ground, to be able to throw a normal invis while I med. If nothing else, it will keep the stupid pumas from aggroing on me.<P>Ports to our home temple, or even better, to any temple (once we earn the faction and do the quest to obtain the spell) would be very nice. I don't expect to get it, primarily because I think there is some voice at Verant who has convincingly put forth the suggestion that having the classes most group-required be the least mobile is balancing. And in a weird kind of way, that is true. If everyone wants a cleric, but it will take an hour for the only ones LFG to get here, then we might as well ask a druid who can be here in 5 minutes.  But it still would be nice to get a temple-port bone thrown our way.<P>Asking for mana regen is nice. Very nice. I do believe that since every other caster class has some way to regain some mana that it is time to add some balance to clerics and give is this ability too. And for the most part, this doesn't enhance our grouping game nearly as much as our soloing game. In a Lguk example, this might mean killing 15 ghouls instead of 14. No big deal. Soloing, it might mean going from 3 blues an hour to 5 or 6. A big improvement.<P> Whoever suggested a Peridot for it is sadly wrong. Burning a peridot for a Harvest-like spell is not soloable, it is only going to be used in groups. When I'm OOM and willing to burn 12 plat to get enough mana to save my tank, I'll use it. When I have finished burning down a mob that drops 2-6 plat, I won't burn 12 plat so I can kill one more of them a little sooner.<P>No, if we get a Clarity-clone, maybe a peridot is justified. But we won't. If we get a Harvest-clone, no reagent worth more than a plat or two is justified, and even that is unnecessarily detrimental. <P>Skill caps. Primarily Defense, Dodge, 1HB, 2HB, and Bash. All of these could be looked at and improved. Again, these skills will benefit us more in soloing than they will in grouping. Grouping will still be med/heal, but soling we take more of a beating more often and requires some defense skills more often. Soloing we are more likely to want to stun a caster with bash, or melee his last sliver of HP with our weapon skills. Adding a little Parry or Double Attack is a good idea, too.<P> Again, the reasoning for this is simple. We wear the best class of armor (plate-class), we carry shields our entire life (except most clerics switch to paws/books/homework/etc. because our shield is usually worthless), and we wield a weapon that, in the real history of Earth, was a favorite of knights and soldiers because it was so lethal to heavily armored opponents.  All  this points to being a factor in a battle. Maybe not a big factor, but it does indicate that we should be some kind of factor in a battle.  If we were a robe-wearing, staff-carrying old bearded feeble priest, then I wouldn't expect to be a factor in a battle. <P>I would never suggest we should infringe on real tanks in battle. Just that we should be able to have a little impact (no blunt weapon pun intended).<P>The second big picture is low levels vs. high levels.<P>Clearly, in the high level game, we are extremely desired. In the low-mid level game, we are often second-class citizens. Particularly at levels 19-24 and at levels 29-34.<P>In lower levels, we compete with shamans and druids who have similar, and for 15 levels identical, healing abilities. Yet those two classes have all their other useful utility spells.<P>Most class-talk threads, ours included, have focused on the high-level game. But I think clerics, of all classes, have the hardest time before reaching the high-levels. We just don't offer enough to groups, until 39th level, to really be in demand yet.<P>The solution here is harder to reach. We can't ask for higher skill caps (though our Dodge cap is so awkwardly low that raising it would help us in the mid-levels). We can't ask for pets, or more healing spells, or better undead nukes (at these levels our undead nukes are just fine.). So how can we fix the low-mid levels?<P>Well, adding Bash and Double attack might be a bit of a start. Letting us join the tanks in the front line and make a difference would really improve our desirability in groups of this level.<P>Another big, big help would be to move our healing spells around so that there is no level, not one, where a druid or shaman is casting the same healing spell we are. Well, maybe all three of us get the same healing spell to start the game, but after that, we should always upgrade one grade of healing spell ahead of druids and shamans. That would make us more desirable for healing to offset being less desirable for utility.<P>Another thing might be to tweak our entire line of AC buffs, starting with Holy Armor and ending with Bulwark of Faith. Holy armor adds the same AC as a banded bracer. Big deal. It helps, sure, but not enough. I never heard anyone saying "hey, can I get that extra 6 ac now, I really need it."  This line of spells needs to be reevaluated and enhanced to where other group members are asking for the spells. Especially in low levels. Perhaps a 50% jump to every spell in this line, maybe a bit less of a jump in the higher levels where tanks are asking for them. I don't even care if the mana cost is increased accordingly. The tanks aren't looking at mana cost, they are looking at how much their AC jumps after we cast it.<P>I don't have many suggestions for our low-level through mid-level game. Making us fight a little better, making our AC buff more desirable, and moving healing spells around a bit so our heal is preferable to any druid or shaman of the same level would probably be enough.<P>I welcome any other thoughts.<P>Oh, and please. We don't need better Bind Wounds. Sure, from a role-playing perspective, this skill belongs to us healer types. But I can sit and med, without clarity, then cast a healing spell, all in less time and for less money than I could bind wounds. So unless clerics receive some kind of 3x modifier to how effective the results of binding wounds are, as in one successful bind wounds heals 3x as much HP as other classes, then I would never use this skill. And neither would any other cleric, probably.<P>Also, Turn Undead? Are you kidding? I can see it now. Cleric in Frenzy room in Lguk. Puller brings too many ghoulies, so cleric saves the day by turning undead. Result? Entire groups are wiped out at Lord, Ass/Sup, Frenzy, etc. as the entire dungeon is trained by 30 or 40 enraged ghoulies. Even the group with the foolish cleric will get wiped out. No thanks.<P>If by Turn Undead you basically apply a fixed-duration root and a fixed-duration snare so the mob turns its back and stands there, not attacking, then maybe it's viable. Especially if it is short duration but attacking/nuking the turned undead doesn't break it. That's probably a bit much, though. Unless there is a very long reset timer on the ability, like there is on Lay on Hands.<P>Wow, this post is long enough. Sorry to ramble.<P>Morodullin<BR>Rambling Priest o Brell<BR>(repost from another thread)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I know that they feel that it's a balance issue with Druids and Shaman needing to have their healing power increased. What I don't understand is why. From the way I see it Druids and Shaman are like real like gereral doctors that people go to on any issue. They know a little about everything but if you really need help they point you to a specialist that being the Cleric. <P><BR>From what I as a Cleric can do and what a Druid and Shaman can do are not even close to being the same. The Druid and Shaman buffs cost nothing but mana to cast while we need to spend money on components.  How is that balanced out can someone tell me that? We as Cleric know how to heal and buff yet we have to pay when classes that can also heal don't??? Is there a problem here?? I believe so. Another thing we aren't even able to destroy undead. In ever DND game or book Clerics have been able to destroy mass undead we can only take on one at a time. Is that fair also Druids can group kite and I've seen this done Shaman get a pet to help them along I ask WHY?? <P>   It's been said that we are needed for high level raids.  Now I don't about most of you but the only real raid a Cleric has to be on is a plane raid all other raids they can called to  rez any dead. There is a 3 hr time limit after death.  I know most raid take hrs but as everyone that's been on a raid know they are there for something they really want the exp lost is worth it if they get that item they can alway get exp back. I've been on raid with 30+ people and I was the only cleric and when everyone died I was there for over an  hour and a half rezzing. While those that I rezzed left and started playing again getting that 10% back while I was still rezzing. Is that fair and how is that balanced out with the other classes?? How many  Clerics have spent time rezzing when they could be doing something else. Look at what we do not  what you think we do. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have a few suggestions that coincide with these:<P>1)Invis is a MUST but only after you can revive or xp rez so add it at 29 or 39 maybe?<P>2)Our DA and DB spells prevent damage, but often I get hit and stunned and cannot run away. Agro should switch off me and mobs shouldnt be able to stun while this is going on (So either I can run or sit and med quick to help party - this is only cast when almost all OOM anyway.) This is DIVINE remember? If these spells are made targetable then recast should be increased. This is kinda like Paly LH in a way (My thinking at least.) Maybe the spells should be aquired at later levels if this is thought of as too pwerful. Remember though - you cannot attack while invun!<P>3)We gotta have bash. Duel weild is out of question, but bash we must have. Clerics use shields more than any other class I bet. No dmg needed for bash just stun and low cap on skill of 50 perhaps.<P>4)Targetable Halo and Yaulp - these are useless to me because I dont need em for myself really. Yaulp is short lived spell as it is really.<P>5)Reduce mana for armor type spells or increase AC and duration.<P>6)I dont really see a good use for any of the area effect spells. We dont do enough damage to anything we can get xp off of by the time we get these spells. Perhaps give them sooner? Most clerics would really think twice before causing a group of anything to attack them (even if it is green). Perhaps replace these with group buffs instead?<P>7)I can solo a blue if Im FM and use all my mana on it to blast it. I dont see a way to fix that unless we do more dmg or get mana back faster (or use less mana for attk spells). It would be nice to stand my ground against greens that I get no xp off of just so I dont have to zone everytime im jumped without backup (while traveling). They still hit us way too much for us not to be getting xp off of them if we win.<P>8)Temple Gate - AWESOME IDEA. Perhaps a totem/spiritual item should be consumed to do this. Make a lore item that is dietys symbol and is consumed to cast this spell. Hell even make it expensive. This item should be bought at the temple though for repeat returns. If cleric forgets it it can only be found at hes temple so he must return to get one. SHould be mana expensive as well. Only aquired at like level 29 or above.<P>9)Sacrifice Self - Tp party to temple leaving cleric behind. Would also use the symbol mentioned above. Kinda like an evac but screws the cleric somewhat to keep things balanced. Would require crapload of mana to cast too. 39 or above spell.<P>10)Clerics dont do that much damage melee really. I think we should get a spell that causes our attacks to do percent of damage we deal to convert it to hp for us or better yet MANA. I hit for like 16 dmg now at 33 and have over 1200 mana so this would not drastically increase the amount of mana I recoup.<P>11)Holy Prayer - Meditation at some point should actually be more beneficial to a cleric and increase mana faster. Start discipline or spell at 29 perhaps?<P>12)Holy Water - Thrown at undead should hurt them. Range slot item. Clerics should be able to make this at their temples. Cleric only item?<P>13)Potions of healing! Cure poison! Cure disease! We should be able to make these at our temples. They should be weaker versions of our spells and not go any higher than greater healing. <P>14)Holy Deliverance - Speed spell that breaks when we attack. kinda like scale I think. But would need levitate built in. Short duration spell perhaps? Last as long as Yaulp type spells perhaps and self only.<P>15)I would like something like spirit pouch. I have high wis and very little str so after I pick up one weapon of loot Im ENC. I think some sort of summonable bag would be nice even though I go LD alot... Clerics need the loot to afford the regs! Perhaps a nodrop instead of  norent would be nicer so we couldnt hand them out to our friends.<P>16)Summoned weapon doesnt do much dmg - crank this puppy up! Maybe make it part of the item in #10 so that this weapon MUST be used to get the mana when doing melee.<P>17)Anything that does something bad to undead should be ours and it should hurt more when we do it. My diety said so!<P>18)I want a wisdom buff!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Clerics need to be able to recoup mana or use less on whats there now. We cannot survive melee. It is unsafe whenever we travel alone. We must travel to nasty places to revive people alot. We dont see our home temple after first few levels much anymore (Im homesick!) I doubt any of these changes will make the cleric all-powerful. We are still going to need groups. Thes changes would make the cleric a more tolerable character to play. <P>Severene Majere<BR>&lt;Coven of the Black Thorn&gt;<BR>33 Cleric<BR>E Marr Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Clerics are imbalanced in a negative way from levels 19 to 33 compared to the other healing professions.  Regarding sheer healing ability, shaman clearly and definitively are the Masters of Healing during that phase.<P>At 24th level, shaman acquire Regeneration which heals 410 points and costs 100 mana.  At 24th level, clerics acquire Greater Heal which heals 288 points and costs 150 mana.  So, for 50% more mana costs, clerics gloriously get to heal 132 points less!<P>The difference becomes even more disproportionate as both classes approach 33rd level.  At 33rd, a shaman's regeneration heals 545 points, approaching double the amount of a cleric's Greater Heal of 306.<P>With the constant med-med-med routine clerics are forced to endure after a battle, which adds to the boredom factor of the entire class, please address this healing imbalance that the mid-level cleric encounters every day.<P>Thank you.<P>Riffi Gemstone<BR>gnomish vicar<BR>Bertoxxulous server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Destroyers of the undead rather than caretakers. Religion playing a big part of what a cleric can do. Maybe clerics that follow mithril marr get better attacks and bashes and such. Something that gives uniqueness not only to clerics but to your religion as well. May take a bit of coding tho so not sure if this is possible. Maybe Everquest 2 they will finally place gods as more important character creation. Ever thought about questing to change your faith?

</FONT><HR><BR>This may be late. I was waiting for this chance and fear it may have passed me by. But if by any chance Absor gets around to this, here it is.<P>Clerics need slightly stronger melee, it is understood that they arent melee's but they should atleast be able to go toe to toe with a melee, definitely not win. They do need to be able to do more then get laughed at however. I propose raising the melee skills to 5x level plus 5. as all standard skills and adding in the bash skill. many clerics carry shields but cant use the damn things.<BR>I like the previously mentioned angel form. it is entertaining.<BR>Consideration is needed for the evil clerics. I am evil, and to get my quest armor I need to do good. And to get my planes armor I need to kill priests of Innoruuk. Problem being, i lose faction with Innoruuk. How does this encourage roleplaying? Could we add a quest that will make planes armor questable for only dark clerics?<BR>Also, we are severely underpowered, we cant deal enough DD to kill most classes in pvp and our melee skills are not good enough to cover the difference.<BR>Could we decrease casting time on some of our spells at higher levels? It makes them nearly impossible to cast with any type of interuption.<BR>I like the idea of religion specific spells, by making the spell diety specific...give the cleric the abilty to charm undead and possibly some underpowered DoTs to the appropriate ethos. Give greater healing to those of healing gods. Better buffs to those of Mith Marr. so on and so forth. This is a very fun concept.<BR>And my final suggestion, resistances. I have more trouble than its worth with everything and everybody(pvp) resisting my spells. They are all magic based and it gets extremely annoying.<BR>Thank you, 60 High Priest, Tallon Zek<BR>much of this info is given from experience as a cleric over the past year.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Spell Suggestion:<BR>A spell it would be nice to see clerics get, that would be completely in their line of purpose, that is sorely needed, would be a quick-casting spell that cures dots without having to dispell your positive buffs.  A single target adn group version of the spell woudl be a lovely addition.<P>Finn, 60 High Priest</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor I know that you are basically done, but if you haven't seen this elsewhere:<P><BR>Prayer Spell (Mana Regen) (Suggested Level 34/39)<P>Cost : 100 mana<BR>Duration : 60 minutes or till clicked off<P>Effects:<BR>1) Silence (cannot cast spells)<BR>2) Mana Regen (+5)<P><BR>--------------------------------------<P>Casting time and refresh are negligable. Numbers can be moved around. What this spell DOES:<P>This spell will only be useful if you can regen for 20 ticks without having to cast a spell. Otherwise it would be useless. The effect would have to be click-off easily, and the point is that it would provide a mana regen that came at cost.<P>Perhaps upping the cost to 300 (60 ticks) or something higher.<P>Summary:<BR>Cleric blows mana casting.<BR>Cleric cannot cast spells while under the effect.<BR>The spell is not viable unless it has at least payed for itself.<BR>Thus the cleric must med for at LEAST xxx ticks where xxx = spell cost / boost.<P>- Gaeb<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055974-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055974.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055974-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055974-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055974-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055974&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055974&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
