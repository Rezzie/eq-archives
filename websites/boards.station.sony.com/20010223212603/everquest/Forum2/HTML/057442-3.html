</FONT><HR>Sharrowe, good to see you again.  I -AM- having fun, unlike some of the absolutely amusing pissers and moaners here.<P><BR>I couldn't care less about level 60, I am not likely to ever see it, and even if I do, I am fighting the same monsters now as I will at 60 so it means bugger all to me. Skyshrine is an example used by me because it's one of the zones that casters like to cry about, and one I've been hunting heavily in the last week or so. <P>I've hunted in every zone in the game outside of Chardok, Howling Stones, Veeshan's Peak, and velious zones past Siren's Ghetto, though Western Wastes will happen this weekend, I also hunt with guildies of all classes ranging from 45 to 60 so I do have SOMTHING of a clue about what works and what dosent.<P>People, get some perspective. it's supposed to be a FUN game. if you're not having fun, quit.<P>And I'm flattered that you think my quiet voice of reason is going to drown out all your whinging. I doubt it will.  if upgrades happen, great. but if they don't, no big. I'll still be having fun.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Very good post Vendrix, I agree completely. Only melee classes can look forward to becoming more powerful after 60. Once casters hit 60 and get their spells, thats it.. Whats there to look forward to, a little extra mana? Most people are lucky to dump all their mana before die, therefore, is a little extra mana really usefull? Hardly.<P>I would love to see items that actually increased spell ability, casting times, etc. -Excellent- ideas. I don't think anyone can disagree with this based on melee's already get these. Haste, hp regen, etc.<P>How about giving casters something to look forward to besides spells that anyone can buy?<P>Tuan<BR>High Priest<BR>Midnight Sojourn<BR>Erollisi Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is a really good posting.  The original one.  Not the people who are level 45 and still "love this game" and "don't understand the whining."  <P>EVERYONE who is playing this "game" wants to play it for "fun."  What is "fun" at level 45 is DIFFERENT from what is "fun" at level 60.  "Fun" in a game like this means making a contribution to the goals and fight in progress.  People who aren't level 60 and therefore can't understand that, but who nevertheless feel entitled to spout off and pee all over a posting like Vendrix's, drive me nuts. <P>At level 60, doing high-end encounters in this game, some classes are NOT having fun!!!  Necros are NOT having fun at that level.  Enchanters (at least any who aren't the primary 1-2 on a raid) have NOTHING to contribute to such an encounter.  They aren't having "fun" because they no longer can contribute to the goal and get that feeling of accomplishment.<P>The useful life of the game EQ would be extended by some serious attention to issues such as this.  When the level 60's have to log off and play their level 45's in order to have any "fun" in this game, I hear the bell tolling.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Melee classes get % increases eh? Well, then casters should get items that haste either their casting time, or increase mana by a percentage.  Or maybe items that cut down the % or fizzles or the % of being interrupted.  don't expect to see this ingame though, as verant hates anything that is halfway reasonable/intelligent.  remember, it's THEIR world, and we're just the brainless peeons who pay their salaries.  As you might be able to tell, I'm going to switch games as soon as a true competitor to EQ comes out.  And if there's any justice in this world, we'll all get to sit back and laugh our butts off when VI goes under from lack of revenue.<P>Eco the Cynic</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ecofreak, I'm feeling exactly the same way.  I play a wizard, the ultimate in classes that get screwed by Verant every time a new item gets added to the game.  Look at the post 50 spells, they just don't scale.  Verant has designed the caster classes in a way that shames their whole company.<P>Where would Oracle be if their products couldn't work better as you throw better hardware at it?  Where would the high end computer manufacturers be if they didn't design things with upgrades in mind?  The idea, if you design a system in a way to allow it to be upgraded easily, people will buy it.  If you can't add additional CPUs, hard drives, memory, and so on, not only do you force people to buy a whole new product every time they want to get something better, but you may need to redesign the computer every time you get a wealthy customer who would be willing to pay the money for something faster.  What did these companies do right?  They make a design which scales up as the need increases, without major design changes.<P>Casters don't scale up.  Stat improvements, and items don't improve the caster classes.  Melees scale up very well, throw more good items, and watch them pump out damage at a higher and higher rate.  Solution would be to fix this, and make spells improve by 50 to 100 damage per level, not 5 to 10 damage per level.  This is common sense, even Ice Comet scales by 10 points, but it caps only one level after you get it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>That's always been a question of mine too, Casters get zip in the way of improving their spell abilities speed and quantative landings even in the face of magic resistances that are inordinately insane. <P>Melees get disciplines, why don't casters? <P>Discipline 1: Focus Cants - 10% SpellCasting time reduction for 10 mins refreshes in 30 mins after it expires.<P>Discipline 2: Focus of Thought - 10% Spellcasting mana reduction, stacks with focus cant, 10 mins, refreshes in 30 after it expires<P>Discipline 3: Focus of the Soul - 15% Spellcasting time reduction and mana reduction, non stacking, 5 mins, refreshes in 60 minutes<P>Discipline 4: Focus of the Element - all elemental based (fire/ice/rain) spells have 100% chance of doing 100% damage for 5 mins, spellcasting time increased by 1/5th. refreshes in 45mins. non stacking<P>Discipline 5: Focus: Alteration<BR>Discipline 6: Focus: Divination<BR>Discipline 7: Focus: Abjuration<BR>Discipline 8: Focus: Conjuration<BR>all the preceeding four are only activatible one at a time, tied together like bash/Kick is for warriors, each provides an appropriate casting time/mana reduction for the different schools. Caster moves 30% slower, hp lowered by 50, AC lowered by 25. <P>Discipline 9: Foci of the Flow - Self only activatable Mana regen, twice Clarity II, length: 10 mins, stackable with Clarity II, Manasongs, and the Tenth Discipline. User's movement rate is halved. AC goes down by 50, HP down by 200. <P>Discipline 10: Mastery of the Arcane 3 mins, all spells do instant cast, full damage, 100% magic resistant mobs are hit for half.<P>I know these sound unrealistic (and maybe they are) but there's gotta be some way to scale the power of a post 50 caster... the power curve is kind of skewed considering the items availble for melee.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I get that Verant wants to make certain encounters much harder than others, and require a large "epic" fight.  The problem is the way that verant is going about this:  They give mobs tons of HP's and make them immune to spells so only tanks and clerics really participate in the battle....hmmm how is that fun?  Would it be so overbalencing to have an uber mob that druids, necros and mages could cast on?  I mean when these mobs have over 32000HP (in velious) its still going to be a difficult battle even with necros casting their meesly 300dmg deflux spell...How would it be overbalencing to allow casting classes to contribute their minuscule damage to mobs that have so many hit points?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'll start by saying I quit a month ago, but interested in the possible changes.  I was a level 59.9 magician and had been logging fights from level 53 on.<P>At level 53, I knew our nukes blew chunks in the over all damage scheme, but at least my pet was doing a lot of damage, but level 55, a mage could no longer out damage a rogue, it was about even.  On raids, well, we just couldn't do ****, never have actually.  By level 59, ever pure melee and ranger out damages the "Damage kings".<P>I remember taking logs in HS where resist are almost non existant, I logged our rogue, wizard and myself.  Well, the rogue did over 5 times the damage the wizard did (figuring no resists, which I think was close to the case), the mage did about 2/3 the damage of the rogue, after figuring in every possible damage done (DS, spell casts with no resists, DD, and burnt wood staff).<P>At level 60, even warriors double our output, and we are the supposid melee kings?  Damn, we can't even do faster damage when we full blown nuke half the time (50/50 chance).  A wizard, the "masters of fast damage" are not faster damage dealers than rogues or monks when resists are minimal.  Most epic encounters, they are never faster than any melee type.<P>So, what are casters, water boys, taxies?  Drug pushers.  I'd like to know.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'd alos add one more comment.  Prior to Kunark, when melee's "had it so bad."  How many melee'ers attended raids.  Even then melee's were the overwhelming force, since then, melee's have become hugely more important to the point that casters are either left out, or just put in a group to themself without healers or any way to keep them alive, with the idea of, if they die, the lag frees up.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I haven't been sitting at 60 for months because even though I spend enough time online each day and do enough things to be considered a power'gamer', I'm not a power'leveler'. I do other things with my time, too. And lately I've just seen no need to continue leveling. Why bother? What upgrades do I get?

</FONT><HR>I remember from a MUD I used to play (arctic), there was a spell called Stoneskin that would turn a melee hit for ANY damage down to just 1 point of damage.  There were mobs that were "autostoneskin", so no melee could ever deal enough damage to kill it.  That made damage done by casters to be very important.<P>Arctic also had "Mirror" mobs.  This effect made it so that when a mob was attacked by a spell, the spell would "bounce" off him and attack the caster instead, thus making casters nuke themselves.<P>Both were used to make fights harder and more interesting.  Rather than just adding mobs that quadruple hit for X hundred and have X thousand hit points, perhaps Verant should think up some ideas like these to make the fights funner while inviting people to actually make a strategy beyond "send the sheep until he dies".<P>Rare dropping spells in VP and ST: Good idea.  I don't think I will ever get one of those spells, as I have never been to either zone and I doubt I will for a long long time.<P>Wizard % damage spells: No.  Fix the problem at the root.<P>Casting times: The idea to have items that speed up casting times is a good one.<P>Skills: Items can cast spells, but no items give the ability to do a skill, or even are +skill.  You would figure that a really good rapier would make a person better at parrying, or that a compass would help one's sense heading.<P>Casters against big dragons: Whatever, they suck.  Should they suck?  Perhaps for a few of them, yes.  But likewise, for a few of them, melee should be inaffective.  Otherwise, you are favoring the melee classes.<P>Oh yeah, sup Vendrix.<P>-Hekler, Head Bathroom Cleaner and Gardener of the Tarsis Shriners<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Guaranteed to take down whatever you are fighting without wasting space.<P>Why do I say this?  Clerics heal, monks pull, rogues do damage and CR, warriors do warrior stuff.  Enchie casts haste, and occasionally tash the mob so that the hitters procs will land.   Besides the hitters can debuff/dot/nuke with procs and they are more likely to land than the spell from a caster.<P>Why do I not mention any other class?  Becuase their effectiveness is little or non-existant.  <P>Wizards - Lure spells, probably land, on many mobs if they dump they can do a significant amount of damage (not on uber mobs though).  If you really want you can toss one in for ports and some fast damage every 10th mob.<P>Mages - Well they can count as a level 46 warrior, but if the mob casts fear, don't bother.<P>Druids - grab em for a port, toss em like a used napkin<P>Shaman - make pretty numbers in the stat column, have stackable hp buffs, cant land a spell on anything unless level 60, then they malo so the warriors procs will go off.<P>Necro - Looking for work at duracell.  Lifetaps dont hit on 1/2 the stuff, don't bother casting anything else.<P>Any questions?<P>The basic fact is that with vellious mobs resistances were set too high.  With the exception of wizards (most of the time) and clerics, the rest of us do not have an active role during a lot of the encounters (not just epic, try thurgadin, icewell keep, velkators, Sirens Grotto isn't impossible but darn close, lots of stuff in Sky Shrine etc).  <P>For the necro who was talking about SkySrhine so much, think about the fact that you need a tash to be able to land a lifetap.  Lifetap resists just slightly lower than lures.  Where does that leave everyone who doesn't get lifetaps or lures?  Have you tried casting lifetaps in Icewell Keep (dorfs not the bottom) or on Kobolds in Velketors, or on dragons?  If not then try visiting more than one zone before you throw out all encompassing examples. <P>As a shaman why should I have to ask the warrior to equip his weapon with a slow proc to slow the mob after its been tashed because I cannot land a spell on it (yet the proc will stick!!!!!!)?  Something is inherrantly wrong with even saying that.<P>Its not just that our damage vs mob hps has been reduced, its that we CANNOT LAND ANY SPELLS AT ALL.  I am sick of playing an active role every 45 minutes (when buffs wear off) and cheering from the sidelines the rest of the time hoping for phat lewtz that will uhhh give me enough mana to cast another level 1 spell.<P>Realistically every caster class needs either an unresistable or lure resist spell along the lines of their bread and butter spells.<P>Shaman - slow<BR>Enchie - Mez<BR>Necro - Lifetap<BR>Mage - uhhmmm something that doesnt step on wizzies toes<BR>Druid - Snare<BR>Wizzies - have lures<BR>Clerics - have heals, but an unresistable stun would work.<P>Realistically, that is what is really needed to balance out the classes more.  They aren't going to rework all of the vellious zones now, its too late for that.

</FONT><HR>If I may offer my opinions on this, these are a few of the things I think casters need to be worthwhile in the newer areas of the game.<P>Items effects:<P>Items that increase your mana pool by a percentage of your current max. Maybe 5 percent for a lower level item, and as much as 40-50% as a rare drop off of a super-uber-boss-mob_01.<P>Items that increase your maximum damage on DoTs and DD by a certain percentage.<P>Items that increase the percentage of hitpoints restored by a curing spell.<P>Items that decrease mana cost for ALL spells by a certain percentage.<P>Items that decrease the aggro effect of spells and magic damage by a certain percentage.<P><BR>Spell stuff:<P>Spells that are inherently resisted less.<P>Spells that do more damage. ESPECIALLY for wizards. "Masters of magical damage" should not out-damage other nukers by a mere 20 points.<P>Spells that do a percentage of an NPC's total hp. Note, not a percentage of their CURRENT hp, but their total. To be balanced, these types of spells should have long recast times and an additional effect on the mob so they cannot be used by several casters at once.<P><BR>Some more mana efficient spells and some more items that grant STACKABLE mana regen effects would be good, too.<P>I doubt all (or any, for that matter) of these things will every happen, but they would really help out the poor casters who can't do squat to these uber mobs. I am sick and tired of seeing the monopoly Warriors, Rogues and Monks have on dealing damage to mobs in Velius.

</FONT><HR>I can appreciate the loss of caster power in Velious and Kunark when compared to melee classes. To some extent, I agree with the change -- I just don't believe that every epic encounter should be resolved using the same formula -- which they certainly are right now.<P>I'd like to see some additional high cost one use caster items that magnify spell effects in a manner similar to focus items with pet spells, or possibly bard items with bard songs.<P>Examples:<BR>A necro spell with a reagent cost of multiple essence emeralds and a coffin.  Have the spell duplicate Splurt or another high-end necro damage spell, except make it irresistable.<P>Another possibility, a necromancer death-curse which kills the necromancer and horribly wounds or debuffs the target.  Give this a long casting time, or remove experience from the corpse to prevent abuse.<P>An enchanter spell with a reagent of a platinum diamond ring that irresistably reduces an NPC's magic resistance so that one in ten spells will actually land.<P>A wizard spell that sacrifices a Staff of Temperate Flux to debuff fire and cold resists in a similar fashion.<P>I'm not sure what to offer for magicians except maybe a mega pet buff that kills the pet when it wears off.<P>Healing classes obviously also have to be able to do more than simply buff and heal. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>/agree Vendrix<P>I'm a piddling 54th level Enchanter, but I'm in a powerful guild (7th Island of Sky powerful  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ) and have friends in the two VP / Sleepers guilds on E-Marr, and trust these high 50s / 60th level people, casters are next to useless in the end game.<P>Wizards: Lure? BFD! As mny pointed out, who cares if they can do 4k or even 6k of damage? The mobs have 200k plus HP.<P>Mages: Would you take a 50th level warrior with decent weapons but no armour, no brain and no assist key to fight an epic mob? No, I didn't think so. There goes the mage pet.<P>Necros have been nerfed beyond all recognition, Shazanti said it best, they basically get to give mana to clerics, and do the CR or corpse summoning.<P>Enchanters: The "uber" int caster, right? You know what enchanters do on big raids? We haste the tanks (or click the staff) clarity the casters (only the clerics and necros and buffing classes are useful, but we still C2 the rest  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> ) and then... we try to eat the Death Touches so a useful class doesn't get killed. Enchanters are very useful for xp groups, because we increase the mana a cleric has, and increase the damage a melee does. For a raid, you need maybe two enchies, one if they have the epic. You remeber all that mezzing we did? It goes away on raids. The first resistance that goes up on mobs is magic, all our spells are magic based, high level mobs are just flagged as immune to mez, which takes away all our fun. Thankfully, I can still go to HS, OS or Chardok and have some fun xping, but the end game for enchies is this: you're the only enchie on the raid. Haste the melees, clarity the casters, hit /follow, go read a book with a 20 minute timer set. Enchies can do nothing to "end-game" mobs.<P>Druids: at least they get a pet now, so they can pretend to be helping.<P>Shamans: see driuds. And their buff timer is set at about an hour, rather than 20 mins like the enchie.<P>Clerics: absolute must have. The Donals BP was the one item that came close to giving them a real upgrade post-50... so it got nerfed. Oh, and the epic saves a lot of time on ressing.<P>It really boils down to the gear. Dragon haste = 36% more damage. Kunark weapons = 30% more damage. SoV weapons = 50% more damge. Kunark and SoV have nothing in them that even give me a 5% upgrade to my effectiveness, other than the epic. And the epic itself, just means you need one less enchie along on the raid, the effect itself is barely better the 53 / 56 haste spells, the real bonus is mana free, and fast casting.<P>Anyway, I'm off to complete my epic and have fun xping while I still can. Hopefully my warrior twink will be high enough to raid by the time I get to the end game, and I'll have something to do.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Good post...I am glad as a mage I still add something to these encounters (at least on fearless mobs), but sitting around making mod rods for the wizards to squander away more mana on failed lures is truly frustrating.

</FONT><HR>Well, if you actually had fun playing EQ as anything except for rogues, warriors and clerics, you would be violating The Vision (tm) and your sentence would be a dose of downtime.<P>The Vision (tm) dictates that groups disband when the cleric goes to bed. Either that or they must sit at the zone line for at LEAST 3 hours looking for another.<P>The Vision (tm) also states that casters such as Druids, Necromancers and Wizards may only have fun for the first 50 levels, after that The Vision (tm) decrees that these classes must be useless. <P>The Vision (tm) also says that if you are a Paladin, SK or Ranger, you must heed to the Warrior monopoly post 50, and start a new class.<P>The Vision (tm) says that every ISP in America sucks, The Vision's (tm) flawless network is never at fault for connection problems. <P>The Vision (tm) decrees that all monopoly classes will be well taken care of. Complaints will result in massive flames on the EQ message board.<P>There, you all know about The Vision (tm). </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>For the longest time I thought it was just me, then I realize...no in fact the item drops in Kunark (and I've not seen much of Velious yet to make an informed statement) are mostly all melee based.<P>After spending a week + of hazard duty deep inside city of mist with my enchanter and getting NOTHING to show for it.  Every item we got was melee, and of course went to those that could use it.<P>When all you see month after month is 'god' melee type items drop, and casters get items with reclaim energy and the like...well it's depressing.<P>The point of the original poster is right on the head.  Caster -vs- melee balance is screwed up post 50, and in Kunark and Velious both from what I can see.<P>Absor ought to be doing some serious reading of this thread and approaching the dev team and others to come up with some solutions, but I honestly don't expect it to happen.<P>Thus...I made my warrior twink.  <P>I'll have to figure out when the next EQ like game comes out, that provides some competition whether I'll stay with EQ or hang it up.<P>As things are now, it's pretty messed up.<P>Mindreaver *</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>/rebump<P>In case you missed me I'm back. Again, I'm saying the same thing Ven is saying, I AM USELESS AT LEVEL 60. Tanks can hit any uber mob in the game, what can I do? Buff them! That's all I can do. Again, it's broken Verant, fix it. Why can't casters damage uber mobs or even any mobs that are blue at this level? Why can a wizzy, the master of nuking, only do 1200 damage max if a spell sticks at this level when the mobs have 400000 hp? (That's not an exaggeration) Tanks get 90% of all the loot in the game and casters get +int and +wis items, yet any player with half a brain (and access to the hundreds of spoiler sites) has 200 or more by level 30??</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057442-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057442.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057442-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057442-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057442-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057442-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057442&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057442&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
