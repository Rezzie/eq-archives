</FONT><HR>I see Bodhi saying alot about post 50 monks.<P>Post 50 monks are the ones that are finally capable of becoming usefull in groups again.  They have the posibility of getting the weapons which will put them back on top for damage.  Granted, these weapons take 10 to 50 hours of camping, but they can at least do the camp.<P>Pre 50, monks have NO CHANCE of competing with warriors, shadowknights, rangers, and paladins who are all wielding very very common very very good weapons due to twinking or simple avliability (wurmslayer and velious weapons come to mind).<P>The average monk should be able to outdamage the average warriro significantly.  Yet, the average warrior can get a wurmslayer at level 40 easily without twinking (1k per scale on a pvp server is very little money), and the average monk can get possibly a pair of 11/24 or 12/24 weapons by level 40 (3k to 6k on TZ depending).  There is a HUGE out damaging problem with the warrior weapons (wurmslayer vastly outdamages trance and tranquil stick--names might be very wrong).<P>To fix this problem, I think the answer is found in the upping of natural HTH damage, OR in upping the number of hits a monk makes.  Alternately, this means letting us use more than one special attack.  And this all needs to be implamented around level 40 at the latest!  NOT at level 50.  The monk class needs to be fixed throughout the range of levels (starting at 20 to 25 I would say).<P>Monks simply do not deal damage like they should (as compared to warriors/rangers/shadowknights/paladins) with the unballanced weapons for other melees which are VERY common and VERY cheep.<P>Sure a staff that is 39/40 (or thereabouts) would be incredible for a warrior.  But for a monk these type of weaposn should be COMMON PLACE.  The necessary difference in function was not taken into account when introducing these weapons (which I consider a coverup for a mistake anyway).  The uber weapons need to be ballanced so that if a monk should be doing 20 percent more damage than a warrior, we will commonly find weapons that will deliver that percentage.<P>So, what I am saying is that monks need help for damage throughout levels.  I am consistantly outdamaged by SKs and Paladins (I am wielding an adamantite staff, fighting baton and sap of piety right now) simply because they have weapons which outclass mine, and are vastly more accessable--particularly when I cant cary any ammount of loot (items or money) without loosing alot of AC.<P>Pers</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I only have a low level Monk, but there is one thing that has always bothered me.  The new attacks that Monks get periodically just seem to be upgrades to the last skill.  I suggest instead making each skill viable.  Make some faster, and some stun but do little damage or rechage slowly.  Maybe some could proc a spell at higher levels, or knock opponents back.<P>I think that these skills should either be a matter of personal choice, or be situational.  This would allow for greater tactics or personalizations ("my monk loves round kick" "well, mine likes dragon punch")<P>Just my 2cp</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1. I don't know about you all, but doesn't it seem weird that the Iksar shackle quests are really good, and the human monk headband and sashes really suck, I would like to see a change there! maybe by finishing the damn thing!<P>2. I would like a random thunderkick to happen, just like the warrior critical hit, that would be cool to me, as a discipline, its useless, but as a random thrown in attack, it looks better. honestly all the disciplines suck. I would much rather have just innerfire, stonestance and um that's about it! hehe<P>3. At the monk Botb tourney it was pretty sad seeing all the monks look almost exacltly alike. Ugh, lame! Give us something to look forward too, I don't want to go out of this world the way I came in, LOOKING LIKE A Newbie!<P>4. Stack our fists with Shissar, sorry makes no sense that all the other epics stacks but ours doesn't.<P>5. Let Feign Death work when the big stupid giant keeps enraging on me for quads and I Feign six times only to die, with out 1 failure message. What's the deal with that?!<P>6. An increase to damage would be nice I think, as well a little ac and hp boost. I just think it fits, I like to tank, but not with the little amount of hps I have in comparison to other classes <P>Master Kaladiel Skywallker<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>To summarize for me:<P>1.  It's the understanding of most people posting here that monks should do more damage then any melee class but rogues.  In exchange they cannot take damage as well as any melee class but rogues.  If our understanding is faulty please enlighten us.  <P>Please give damage output a serious investigation and adjust as necessary.  If, after an investigation, it appears monks need to do more damage at some levels then of course a way has to be decided how to do it.  In my mind, HOW additional damage would be done is secondary although something which adds flavor to the class is always preferable.<P>2.  Please decide what feign death is supposed to do. Then make sure it does whatever that may be at all levels.<P>3.  I've always considered monks to be minimalists with regard to equipment, so I would like it if H2H is always a reasonable option, perhaps by raising H2H damage at some levels to be comparable to weapons obtainable at those levels.  <P>4.  I'm aware that I cannot come close to outdamaging a warrior twink.  However, I don't really see what can be done about it other then not allowing twinking (great in theory, don't know how to impliment).  Perhaps make it so a monk twink can out damage a warrior twink?  Perhaps that's possible although the whole subject seems pretty bizarre.  In practice I usually just avoid long term relationships with bad twinks -- I may group with them when I need a group but I won't join a guild that does lots of twinking and powerleveling (it ruins the game in my mind).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Fighting casters and melee mobs:<P><BR>Warriors have the HPs, Resists (innate and by item) and stun/bash make them ideal to take on casters. (They are also very nearly as good as a monk damagewise against any mob)<P>Monks should be better than warriors against pure melee mobs to balance this. <P>Monks avoison skills are great..but what people who say "monks tank too well" don't realise is that a monk cannot tank a caster mob (as their avoison skills mean nothing verses spells). This includes fighting nearly any high level mob with a proc or AoE ability too.<P><BR>Suggestions:<P>Add a way that monks can stand up to casters (increasing resists per level or a spell dodging ability).<P>Make monks preferrable when you are going to fight mostly casters or mostly melees. Currently warriors are always preferable.<P>Give a monk the ability to do more damage so they take the mobs down quicker.

</FONT><HR>Regarding the changes of the epic quest. I have concerns with the changes proposed to a subquest of the epic. The Robe of the Lost Circle quest.<P>I believe if all of the changes are implemented it would GREATLY unbalance the game and have unintended consequences. Specifically if 2 of the things are BOTH implemented.<P>1) Remove the Robes off Brothers Q/Z <BR>2) Making the Headbands/Shashes NO DROP.<P>This would result in REQUIRING Iksar to raise faction in both Qeynos and Freeport. If Iksar did this (raise faciton), it would remove the faction penalty suffered by the Iksar. Therefore the Iksar would be just be as the humans only with better stats. Which would unbalance the game (IMHO). <P>Once this is done the demand for Raster (Ultra-rare spawn) would then go up as the Iksar MUST camp the spawn to complete the quest. I believe the camp for the spawn is typically around 80-100 hours.<P>I personally think that the robes should remain on Brother Q/Z and the Headbands/Shashes be made NO DROP. 3 reasons.<P>1) Keep the demand for Raster at its current level.<P>During the epic quest the upgrade to the RoTLC (Robe of the Whistling Fist) is turned in. Monks typically redo the RoTLC quest after their epic in order to get another Robe of the Whistling Fist.  If they can no longer skip the Raster camp, by killing Brother Q/Z, then demand for Raster will then go up. So you have level 50+ Monks competing for an ultra-rare spawn with level 40+ Monks. In a zone that for most people camping it gives NO experience.<P>2) There is a CHOICE in completeing the quest.<P>For either Human or Iksar (that has done the faction work) they have a choice of either camping 80-100 hours in an zone that will probably NOT give them experiance OR get 2 uber groups together to kill an NPC. <P>3) Killing Brother Q/Z is a feat in itself.<P>Brother Q/Z are NOT easy to kill. From what I have heard it takes 2 (two-not 1, but 2) full groups of 50+ (some say 55+) to take down either NPC. Even then a group is likely to lose one or more. So for those who wish to avoid a long camp, they must gather up 2 groups of 50+ players and THEN find and kill either of the NPCs (both are rare spawns).<P>PLEASE give this some consideration when making your changes.<P>Note:<BR>Yes I have a vested interest in this. I am a casual gamer and I play an Iksar Monk. I will not be able to complete the Raster camp for the RoTLC. So it would be nice to have an avenue availible for me (and I realize that casual gamers are the red-headed step-children of EQ).<P>Thanks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hand to Hand vs One Hand Blunt<P>Im currently lvl 55 Monk, I use either fists or a 2 hand wep(not important which). I unloaded my One hand Blunt weps at lvl 52. So since then I have not used that skill more than a couple of fights.  <BR>Why is my attack still rated 20 points higher when I use 1hb as opposed to my fists?<P>I thought a change was announced before to make Hand to Hand skill = to One hand Blunt. Hand to Hand is not going up to the lvl One hand blunt was at 3 levels ago. One of the levels included in this is a Super Hell level 54, so I have definately fought enough with it for this skill to be higher.<P>Monk only Armor VS All/All<BR>Your argument for not upping Monk only AC pieces is something along the lines of overpowering us defensively. Well guess what? I wear all the All/All pieces and get the AC anyway so whats the point? The only Monk only piece I wear is my robe I had to quest for. I am lvl 55.

</FONT><HR>Regarding the Epic and the ROLC, if you change the quest to remove the robes off of qwinn and zephyl, i would hope that you edit the epic quest to give us back our robe. this robe takes forever toget and aside from the fungi tunic, it is the best robe in the game, i woud hate to have to camp raster again, this time without exp just to get the robe back. i would also rather have the rolc after finishing my epic because it has better stats than the rowf, i dont need the effect anymore. but to camp raster again to get it would be way to much work.<P>OH and on a side note, monks are great but start losing a little at 51, compared to other classes. i wouldlike to see a knockback on kick, and maybe make a successful feign drop you on the hate list when you pop back up. and a minimum damage on flying kick.<P>if you increase our damage output without a "evade" like ability we will just die a lot more. i outtaunt my whole group most of the time anyways, esp. when i am pulling. i can basically forget living through an uber mob, once the first few taunters go down guess who is lunch, and that seems to be true for all monks i know, not that it is bad but more damage faster would just kill us faster, i like the idea of adding a knockback to a old special attack, but you should also add a "evade" type(though not as good) skill to one of the others also, only work on contact kinda like Instill Doubt.<P>Frenzy Style<BR>Brell Serilis<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have a few suggestions to make regarding my class:<P>1. Monk Armor<BR>I think it would be nice to see some sort of logical progression in Monk Armor, that it should follow a natural order from  cloth/raw silk, cured silk, Crescent, etc... up to planer armor like Silvermoon/Shiver.  It does kind of bother me to know that my shiver legs have less AC than a lot of good monk non-planar armor so I had to ask myself what would make me want to wear planar armor? After all it is a badge of honor to me being the souvenier of my first plane raid.  But rather than cause a balance problem with adjusting the AC, why not just make it look different? perhaps change it's looks to that of the new black panther armor, after all it did come from the dark plane of fear.  It would certainly make me want to wear shiver over something else with better AC.<BR>   <BR>2. Critical hits on throwing.  Rogues already get crits on throwing in addition to Deadly strike.  I personaly think they should stay master of that domain.<P>3. Changes to epic/robe of lost circle.<BR>A lot of monks on my server have decided to abandon camping Raster (arguably one of the longest quest camps there is in the game) in favor of the faster way of gathering enough people to whack Quinn and/or Zeph for his robe.  Currently there is no way to differentiate between those who spent the time camping the mobs and questing for the robe vs. those who skipped the quest and merely got together severeal friends to kill the mob for it.  Obviously questing for the robe is the harder way to do it and the least preferred of the two ways, yet the reward is the same.  If you make the quest doable only the "hard" way, you should reward those who invest more time into it with a "better" item or even the same item with a different look to it (see #1).<P>4. Regarding the Treant fists.<BR>I guess it's not really a balance issue, but it would be nice to see the reward vs. the time spent on it increased a bit.<P>Overall though I would say our class is fairly well balanced.  At level 49 I find I do formidible damage in a group.  My defense/ac/hp is not the greatest, however I find that I hardly ever tank in a group anymore.  <P>Thanks for your time.<P>--Tigerfist--<BR>49 Monk<BR>Prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here is my list of personal thoughts on some of the problems I have run into being a monk.<P>QUESTS- The sash and headband quests are ok for a newbie, but I never did them because it's a lot of running around for little reward. I don't know any monk over lvl 20 that is wearing the sash or headbands. People only do them now for the robe of lost circle. The TREANT FISTS quest is insane. I spent over a week in 10 hour instalments waiting for the gorge goblin to spawn and only finally got him at level 45. Then I find out they aren't even as good as gem inlaid gaunts which is an easy quest, or can be bought for cheap. ROBE OF LOST CIRCLE see TREANT FISTS. Now just add in the fact that if you don't do this quest, no epic in the future for you. Almost every class gets a set of quested armor. Crafted for WAR, Lambet for BRD, Totemic for SHM, Ro for PAL, Ivy for rangers,and so on for rogues, shadownights, clerics etc. Monks get headbands and sashes. That's just sad.<P>FD- This has to be changed into a memory wipe effect. What is the point of having this skill at lvl 45 if when you get up, everything you agroed, even if you can't see it anymore comes back to get you? I can live with it failing, and I can live with timing it with casters so it doesn't fail, but what good is it to try to single pull, if you end up with everything anyway? I spent and hour FD in lower guk frenzy room because no matter how far away the mobs got, the moment I stood up they came running. One time I got so far away that it took over 5 minutes for the train to get to me after I stood up. It's sad when a group votes for a pally to pull over a monk.<P>FACTION- PoG is great, just don't kill anything, or heal anyone in your group while they fight. Why? Druids everywhere will see you as KoS. Where did they put the best monk armor? PoG. When I saw the stats on the armor I was excited to get level 46 so I could head up there and finally get something usefull. the problem is, no one wants to go there and ruin thier faction. The items are of course no drop. What you end up with is a plain full of monks, most of them dead, and everyone looking for the same items. Hard to get a rez if clerics are afraid to venture up there. Is it worth losing all your gear due to decay?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have been reading a lot of these posts and it boils down to a lot of folks wanting there monks to do a lot of different things.<P>I want my monk to do one thing.  Be a monk, just as it is described.  The perineal eastern Martial Artist.<P>So what is the traditional martial artist like, read the "Bubashi" or "Karate-do nyoman" or "This is Karate".  Simply put traditional Martial Arts or Bujutsu or Budo "depending on how you study" mostly revolves around unarmed combat.  You start adding weapons and now you are studing warrior type skills.<P>Personally in the real Art forms I have studied I have learned to punch, kick and simple movements first (monk 1-20), more complex attacks and defenses with punchs,kicks and locks, blocks and throws(jujutsu or judo like not throwing something) being so much more powerful that a good martial artist can break a rock with bare hands (monk 20-40) to advanced learning.  Looking into how to foil a opponent through their own movements, be it human or animal, striking and killing with one or a short series of blows, locking down a opponent so that they cannot move at all.  Learning how fragile the body is and how easy it is to destroy it with the right movement (monk 41-60)<P>So how does this reflect in the game.<P>1.  A critical strike with bare hands, learned at a high level 35 perhaps.  Cannot be trained only raised through practice.<P>2.  The ability to throw and lock opponents down, once again learned at a high level perhaps 30 this time.<P>With the addition of simple "Vision" type abilities you would see the monk transformed into the fighting machine that he is.<P>Remember that the Warrior is learning tactics to destroy over the large scale and learns to absorb the punishment to achieve that goal.  In other words a warrior is more concerned with destroying a whole encampment of baddies.<P>The monk is concerned with learning to destroy one thing very quickly using that creatures abilities against itself.  <P>For instance Mas Oyama hand chopped the horns off of 50+ bulls in his life, 20th century 50s to 80s.  How did he do it, he used the bulls charge to place it in a position he could deal that particular blow.<P>Finger wigglers mez and stick baddies to the ground through magic.  A Monk should do so because he understands the inanate weaknesses of the baddie.  Is not the idea of a Monk throwing a Dragon to the ground and holding him there laughable.  Yes, until you realize that the dragon does have a high head and neck, lousy trangulation points and thus you have a weakness.<BR>Don't even get me started on giants LOL<P>Personally I have been shut down in real life when a pressure strikes succeeds.  Warriors know how to get through armor, its weak spots.  Monk learn bodies weak spots and then exploit them.<P>Major change yes.<P>Needed change don't know you tell me<P>Budoka<BR>13th LVL Monk<BR>Drinal<BR>If budo is a path and I walk that path it does not mean that there are not other paths to walk or that I am on the right or wrong path.<P>Yudansha<BR>Kyokushinkia-Kan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Problem 1:<P>Monks get aggroed too much while fighting.<BR>A FD or dead monk cannot do damage to a mob.. why get a monk instead of a warrior?<P><BR>Solution 1:<P>Give monks the ability to untaunt.. e.g. If they FD in a fight and stay down for one second they get the message "The dust settles around Kuniosans corpse". When the monk stands up they are now wiped from the mobs hate list. Give this to monks at 50-55.<P><BR>Problem 2:<P>FD does not work if a mob is frenzied on you ..or just a very high level. Monks can tank incedental hits..but will often get chewed up and spit out in uber encounters.<P>Solution 2:<P>FD should stop mob frenzy in the same manner that a player actually dying really does.No more of this "the monster passed an intelligence check " rubbish. For a monk FD failing in a  fight despite succeeding the skill check is as ridiculous as having CH fail every time for a cleric. <P><BR>Problem 3:<P>Monks do not bring significantly (or even noticbly) more damage to a group situation than a warrior. 2 warriors is ALWAYS preferable to 1 Warrior and 1 Monk,<P>Solution 3:<P>Up monks damage to lie between a warrior and rogue (using both common and highest end items as a measure).<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>the description of monks listed in the everquest manual monk are supose to out damage all other melee classes. up to lvl 50 it seems to be the case. but after 50 monks dont keep up with the other melee classes. seems like warriors were increased in power too much and now the damage to tank ability is off. i would like to see the difference in the ratio of damage delivered and damage taken between lvl 50 warriors and monks and lvl 60 warriors and monks. what are the facts? im talking about real game data. any volunteers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>DnT. You are wrong. It is that simple.  I have played both flavors of monks, and unless you fight in a maner so unconventional that I have not been exposed to it, here is how the soloing experience goes. <P>Yes, if siting down is the ONLY way that we healed hp's you would be 100% correct.<P>It is not. Usually I mend ( probably 35% of the points healed in my life are healed by mend, then about 30% are healed by fellow group members( you do group, don't you?), and about 25% ( are healed by bind wounds(  when I am soloing), with the last 10% healed by sitting/standing regen.) so an iskar who works like I do would have about 5% less downtime than a human.  I dont feel that this is a huge advantage.<P>YMMV, but I find it hard to imagine that it will vary much from my observed mileage.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bah, come on guys, we're destroying our own post (i.e. what the hell would any monk want criticals on throwing weapons when we throw one weapon per pull, thats just crazy).<P>We DON'T need AC, we DON'T need more HPs (this is the role of the warrior), what we need is a damage dealing capability that is balance with warriors i.e. warriors good toe-to-toe damage/exception staying power, monks exception toe-to-toe damage/reasonable staying power. If we get this then at least the strain on the healers won't be as bad due to the mobs going down quicker.<P>And no, I don't advacate being on par with rogues in their optimum position, as behind a mob a rogue should do more damage bar none. But we need to be placed ahead of all others in direct toe-to-toe damage (Verant have stated time and time again the monks are supposed to be the kings of toe-to-toe damage) yet due to the raising of the skills to within par of the monk skills and readily available high damage weapons, monks AT THEIR BEST are barely doing 10% more damage that their counterparts.<P>I couldn't care less if Feign Death remained the same as it is (levels of practice have gotten me use to its problems, as long as it doesn't get nerfed again) as long as we are put back on our mantle of best toe-to-toe damage dealers. <P>The Celestial Tranquility effect on the monk epic definitely needs to be stackable with enchanter haste. This weapon is supposed to be EPIC yet its lack of stackability with anything makes it far from so (i.e. how often do monks solo?).<P>As stated time and time again in these posts, Flying Kick and its associated discipline Thunderous Kick needs a major revamp. I like some of the ideas that came out from the Monky Business/Bodi/Zadkiel post. I can see the minimum damage as being the easiest to implement, and if its enough of an increase it may even fix the damage dealing problem (though it would have to be a major increase).<P>The other option (i.e. the flurry of blows one) is a nice idea as well, but I would say it would be placed on the to-much-f&%$ing-work pile. Though it would add allot of diversity to the class and would be a possible way of increasing damage for the monk.<P>If we are placed on top in terms of melee damage we shoudn't need a stun effect on our normal special attacks i.e. this is an ability of large races and warriors, we shouldn't be trying to take another of their abilities, we have enough of our own. If we keep asking for things like this other classes are gonna start asking for FD and mend etc...<P>We need to keep to the basics in our requests, remember Absor hasn't done any investigation into the class issues and is relying on us to educate him....if we keep asking for lots of little things the important issues (which most monks have agreed on - damage dealing, flying kick) will get blurred in with the others and likely forgotten. We'll end up getting something silly like the criticals on shurikens etc... and Verant will say 'there ya go, we gave you something, now you're balanced'.<P>If we rally behind the important issues then at least we'll have a chance they'll be noticed.<P>BUMP on the Zadkiel/Bodi/Monky Business post ;P</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok just my two cp. I believe the general nature of a monk should swing towards the offensive side. an enhancement in upper level dammage output, min dammage increese on a special attack or discaplin would be very nice. Alot of the little naggy stuff like crits on throwing, are kind of stupid. I would be willing to take a hit on either available ac, or magic resistance, or something else if it ment i could deal more dammage and work more efficiantly in a group. The only other issue would be feigh death. in its current form, it seems to fail when it would be honestly used to escape death. The way higher mobs react to someone standing up is pretty bad. Not for the monk standing up, because he can just lay back down and be safe. Its the poor small group of halflings that get taken out because of it that realy sux. I am very happy with my monk. and enjoy playing it more than any other class. Pleas lets stick to the basics, enhance the main issues, balance accordingly, and let the crys for human regen ultra vision, and ninja star crits go silently into the night.<BR>-dyscopope<BR>fennin ro<BR>cof</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The EQ manual states "The Monk is dedicated to honing her body into a pure weapon, shunning most weapons and forms of armor."  I've also heard it said (though I have no official hard copy) that monks are supposed to out-damage any other meele class in a 'toe-to-toe fight.'<BR>Now, I'm a lvl 30 Iksar monk, totally untwinked.  Which means that I'm wandering around dressed mainly in cured silk and smacking things with my fists.  I've never really used anything besides my fists, and I enjoy it.  I enjoy being almost as dangerous naked as fully-equipped.  I enjoy having built-in weapons.  But at no point in my 30-lvl career can I remember having mobs consistenly pissed at me rather than the warrior, and (not surprisingly) I cannot remember a time that I have ever out-damaged most warriors I was with. <BR>Something doesn't add up here.  My fists are fine weapons, and I'm proud of them, but they don't outdamage the weapons of your average warrior these days.  I suppose (if I could somehow scrape together a ludicrous amount of cash) I could get some Knuckle Dusters or even Fighting Batons that MIGHT even things out, or even propell me to the damage forefront, but then I really wouldn't be "honing [my] body into a pure weapon, shunning most WEAPONS..." I'd just be a lightly armored, under hitpoint-powered warrior, with a nasty (non-stunning!) kick...that can't triple attack.  And in that case, why bother with monks at all?<BR>Please, up our damage output somehow, in particular, our hand to hand dmg output.  I think I speak for a lot of monks when I say that I'd rather rely on my fists over weapons, but in todays EQ world, fists just don't cut it.<BR>Thanks for listening.<P>Oust Ralia<BR>Mithanniel Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well the only changes I would make to the monks are these.  I think monk fists should be the fastest things in the game.  This would encourage monks to use their hand rather than weapons.  You would not need to increase damage ratios because faster attacks mean more damage.  Increase monk foot speed too.  We are restricted to 14.0 weight, with that little we should be running much faster, not to mention the intense physical training that monks go through.
