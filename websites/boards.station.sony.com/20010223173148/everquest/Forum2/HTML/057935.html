</FONT><HR>...as related to animal faction since someone brought this subject up on another thread:<P>Definition of druid according to Official strategy guide: <P>"The druid is the original earth-child. You just haven't seen a tree hugged until you discuss deforestation with a druid. They get their power from directly tapping into nature, so they have views on its sanctity. They are so in tune with nature that most animals won't attack a druid unless the druid attacks first."<P>Ok...now force a druid to play like a druid as per definition.<P>1. Most animals will not attack unless provoked, therefore an attack on ANY non-hostile animal<BR>leads to bad faction with ALL other animals.<P>2. For the druids who ignore their call to nature and continue to destroy their faction, link animal faction directly to all the NPC druids who are placed at the stone ring portal sites.<P>3. Druid guilds will not sell nor train druids that have left the way of nature.<P>How to restore faction? Go hunt monsters that defile nature. When you kill an orc, it should reflect that:<P>Your Faction with CrushboneOrcs went down.<BR>Your Faction with AnimalKind went up.<P>This will inject some more difficulty and roleplaying into the druid class which will be felt among those starting out. Perhaps then we won't have so many druids out there when it's not such an easy and carefree road to travel. There will be trade-offs to playing the class.<P>Acid</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Druids that play their roles as *protectors* of nature won't have to worry about their ports becoming dangerous. I'd think most people who play druids not for the SOW, port, solo ability, will have no problem avoiding animal genocide. Druids that stray from nature suffer the porting problem. That's the price they pay.<P>Those who get ported will not be attacked by the NPC druids. Plus the druid can still port invisible. There IS a way around the problem, it's just that he must deal with the slight inconvenience of being KOS by his own kin.<P>Acid</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I can't believe anyone would take this seriously.  A significant number of our spells were designed with animals in mind, and to rip those spells away from us would significantly lower our (useful) spell pool.  Also, faction implies an intelligence at work.  You kill a member of the group, then the rest of the group hears about it and downgrades their opinion of you.  There is no society of lions and tigers and bears (oh, my!) to remember foul deeds.  Our druidly ways make us seem natural for the animals, except for those freaky animals in Velious and cats for some reason.  And why are the cougars near the tower of frozen shadows merely dubious to me, when on the old world any cat of the right level will try to eat me for dinner?  Can't figure that one out...<P>You are correct though, in that we probably wouldn't see any new druids coming along with that sort of penalty in place.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
