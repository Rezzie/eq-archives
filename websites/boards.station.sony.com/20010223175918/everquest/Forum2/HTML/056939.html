</FONT><HR>Ok, I think that pretty much every third message I read here lately brings up the druids ability to quad kite.<P>So, what I want to know is how many druids does everyone see doing this?<P>My take on the matter, being a druid, is that very few druids actually have the skill to do it. That, coupled with the fact that finding 4 mobs that move the same speed to pull in almost any zone is a nightmare. So personally, I just do not even see it happening alot, but it gets brought up all the time here a a major flame against druids.<P>Something else most people do not seem to get is that quad kiting only works in a few zones at select levels and requires you to have a maximum mana pool to boot since you have to use very inefficient AE spells to pull it off.<P>Anyways, I used to do it all the time in OT, but in all the levels I hunted there, I was the only one that I ever saw doing it. I have been to TD ans BW as well, and once again, at least on my server, I was the only one doing it.<P>So are all the other servers different, are DL, OT, BW and TD full of druids running around with 4 mobs each in tow all the time? Is that what the uproar is all about?<P>Ok, show of hands, and no liars please, how many people have actually even seen a druid quad kite, and how many see it all the time?<P>Quad kiting is a highly dangerous and very tricky skill. Based on the fact that pretty much everyone agrees that most druids suck at playing (I agree with this too), I just do not see this as a problem.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Quad-kiting is extremely dangerous.  For a Druid, it is also hard on the mana, but not so much for a wizard.<P>Still, the most efficient solo machine I have seen was a necromancer just killing things 1 by 1.  This is because quad-kiting requires prep time where the kiter has to snare and round up all the mobs into a nice clump.  Then, he has to kite them and nuke, re-rounding up when mobs happen to teleport.  Finally, the kiter gets to sit and regen a full bar of mana.<P>A necromancers kills and just keeps on killing.  The lich-lifetap combo keeps mana coming quick, and the necro doesn't need to "round up" the mobs or anything.<P>Mind you, I am not saying the necros are overpowered.  I am simply saying that quad-kiting is not as wonderful as some people make it out to be.  It is very tedious, and not the most efficient xp process either.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Seriously, quad kiting isn't hard. It's just hard to find a good place to do it other than TD for wizards. Druids have it a bit easier since they can do it at earlier levels in BB for instance.<P>Sucks when you go LD though. You used to keep running if you did, but these days you stop and end up dead every time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have been recently soloing in TDeep (spirocs) and quad kiting druids are a common sight. Sometimes there has been 2 or 3 of them about systematically 'ethically cleansing' the aviary of all the birds.<P>For a soloing shadowknight this can be very discouraging. Some of my fights go badly with spells resisting/interrupting/fizzling/lasting nano-seconds so I often have downtime of 20 minutes or more whilst I bandage and heal/med up, longer if I have had to FD.<P>When I finally have FM/health I prepare myself for the next fight and then go off to find a likely victim. However if there is a quad-kiting druid present then finding a free bird is sometimes nigh on impossible with the aviary stripped clean of spawns. Sometimes another 5 minutes passes whilst I wait for a bird to pop. If I have HT up then I can take a Proven (if not I cannot risk the pull), otherwise its a Watcher, or a Lightfoot? if I'm lucky and get a green that gives me experience.<P>I don't mind druids quad-kiting in zones that have a lot of mobs to go around. But I dislike the fact that they do it at TDeep spirocs with limited spawns and lots of PC competition.<P>Cheers,<BR>Tryst, Reaver(ess)<BR>Luclin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One of my old guildies was a 40 something druid. One of her favorite things to do in Overthere was to snag about 8 blue con cacti and snare them all, some she would DOT. When she had as many as she wanted following her, then she would hit them all at once with her area spell (lightning or something) as many times as she could. Then she would bring the lot back to our group to finish them off. All of the cacti would be down to about 1/4 - 1/3 health.<P>If she could get 8 cacti below half herself, I have no doubt she could probably kill 4 now and again solo.<P>Can't think of ever actually seeing a druid finish 4 personally, but have certainly seen them finish 2 pretty easily.<P>Regards<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I couldn't get a re and had to stomach 7 hours of lost xp. On top of it all, he didn't even sound all that sorry. And he logged off very fast, like a coward.<P>Here's some advice to quad kiting wannabes.<P>DONT GET OTHERS KILLED.<P>There is absolutely nothing worse in this game than dying, and it's all the more frustrating when it's NOT YOUR FAULT.<P>GRRR</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A great group quad kite is in skyfire, get a druid and a pair of wizards and you can get killer exp there. TD is great for the raptors, there is usully not much competition for them, but it truely is a wiz only place, druids just do not have the dmg to do it as well as wizards, they can get groups, hell they can do 75% of every caster classes abilites anyway. Also with the aoe snare wiz use it makes it much easier to get them together. However pre 51 as a wiz it is almsot (if not totally) impossible to quad kite becuase of the horrible mana efficency, single nuking 2-3 spawns you are kiting at the same time is usully more mana efficent until piller of ice.<P>-Xilet 52 wiz bertoxx<BR>-Yes we are verants chew toy  ready thread #10 of wiz posts, with about 4 blue comments for 10 threads</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There aren't many places that you can quadkite efficiently.  There must be non-aggro stuff, and plenty of a single mob type.  Multiple types of mobs just don't work.  TD is popular for this reason.  Eastern Wastes and Ulthorks, OT cacti, and one other place, which I can't remember right now.  It's not all purpose.  It's not terribly efficient.  It is terribly boring.  Lag, wanderers and resists can get you killed.<P>And it's called quad kiting for a reason.  More than 4 and the AE don't work.  I don't know what you guys are trying to do claiming 8 or more, but that's a load of rubbish.  Maybe the druid can kill the first four in that bunch, but he'll be oom then, and will have to bail.  Of course, he'd be a complete moron (and then dead) if he'd bothered to snare all 8 anyway.<P>Yes, occasionally someone goofs and trains ya.  However, whether it is a quadkiter or some other idiot, is irrelevant.  It is rather narrow minded to only mention quadkiters training rather than every other class or group that has done so.  Whether it is by quad or overpull, the result is still the same.  It is unfair to only blame quadkiters for this, when it happens everywhere by anyone.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>["Anyways, I used to do it all the time in OT"<BR>So you did it all the time?]<P>Yes, in the times and places that it was efficient/convienient for me, I did. This worked well for me for many reasons:<P>1. I have a 3 year old daughter that I love to play with regardless of whether I am playing EQ  at the time.<P>2. My playtimes were pretty short sometimes (can only play for short stints instead of long sessions) and it maximized my abilities (single kiting is a HUGE mana waste for a druid, single kite = 85% mana used up, quad kite= 100% mana used up.)<P>3. It requires skill and daring, something that a single kite never took.<P>And to all you folks that posted above about druids kiting more than 4 mobs at once... You must be refering to pre-nerf times (about a year ago) when everyone griped and and had the max number of mobs a AE would effect lowered to 4.<P>Thats what happened the last time everyone ranted about druids iting powers, keep it up and everyones AE's are going to end up as single mob spells.<P>Of course Verants other solution could be to make any more than 2 mobs just wander off. That code is already in place (maximum train code) and would just have to be lowered. This would be awesome if they did it, it would make pulling in dungeons a breeze. Even if they made it a druid only nerf, Druids would instanly become the prefered pulling class in all dungeons, so you better be careful what you wish for.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Hehehe<P>And to the guy who got trained by a druid once. Umm, how many times have you been trained by a monk, sk or any othger class for that matter? Pulls gone bad happen in just about every zone I can think of to one extent or another (Karnors/Mistmoore being the worst). I would have to interperate your post as really meaning, you were upset you got trained in a zone in which normally the train factor is quite low, but this too has happened to most of us.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have played around with quad-kiting, and I'm not sure its much more efficient than root n rot, which is the preferred druid tactic at the moment.<P>If any of my 4 mobs resist ae during the kite, I often find myself running out of mana, and medding in short bursts, only to get up and run farther away.  I have had many kites of low blues last over 10 minutes, as evidenced by ensnare wearing off, in which case, even more mana is required to re-ensnare, and thus more medding on the run.<P>If the kite takes 10 plus minutes, and I have 10 plus minutes of med time after each kite, thats over 20 minutes to kill 4 mobs and med back the mana.  I assure you I can root n rot 4 mobs and med back the mana in 20 minutes, especially since I am always medding back mana using the root and rot method.<P>I guess this is like basketball a bit...<P>A quiet lay-up scores the same 2 points, but the slam dunk draws all the attention, and is a lil bit more fun...<P>As for people being trained by quadders:  Its unfortunate, but obviously you've been trained by non-quadders many, many more times than by quadders.

</FONT><HR>One thing about the root/dot method of getting exp. While true that you can most lilkely kill the same amount of mobs in the same timeframe, I have noticed a measurable difference in the amount of exp you will get.<P>It appears to me that dots act much like pets, where if a dot does more than X (50%?) amount of damage to the mob, the dot take 1/2 the exp away, just like pets do.<P>When I came up with this theory I tested it extensively by killing numerous (to average out level differences) of the same mobs, and to my surprise, exp gain was WAY faster using nukes vs. dots.<P>I have nothing to back this up other than my own experience, but you may want to try it out yourself and see what happens. It will be alot easier to see now I bet since they implemented the "Blue Exp Bar".</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The dot nerf for one, if a Shammy dots a mob in a regular dungeon fight and that mob moves towards him "Poof", there goes 33% of the damage! How about root/nuke, way to powerful way back when, now root (everyones) breaks in no time flat, and the list goes on...<P><BR>[Um, he was talking about being trained by a quad kiting druid.

Go to Karnors, if training is a reason to hate a class, you guys are gonna dispise monks. Anyways, I would hazard a guess that druids most likely account for the fewest times he has ever been trained (unless of course he makes a habit of medding in kite runs). <P>My point is, saying a quad kiting druid trained me is ludicrist, everyone trains everyone all the time. I am sure in OOT he was trained by the group next/behind him more times than druids even, that was always my experience there at least.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Correct me if I'm wrong but the dot nerf only goes in effect after a certain amount of time that a mob is moving. Example: The dot does full damage the first 5-10 secs(not sure exact time) that the mob is moving, so that pulling with dots are not affected. However after that 10 seconds is up and the mob is still moving, then the dot loses its effect. So the remedy to this is root the mob once in a while to reset the timer and for the dot to do full damage, or go in melee range(suicidal as it is).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I would hazard a guess that this nerf is new news to many players at this point as well as they were not around when it happened and it does npt ccome up often anymore. Its just one more nerf to deal with in the big scheme of things.<P>I am curious on one thing though, did the AE mezz get affected by the 4 mob limit as well when the AE nerf was put into place? I never bothered to ask a chanter about this.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>" ...i see druids kiting 8 or 9 mobs"  NOT!<P>Quad kiting is called that for a reason, most you can do is 4 mobs. The ae spells you use when Quad (4) kiting all have maximum targets of 4.<P>Druids and wizards quad kite about the same. Druids may be a tad bit safer since their snares last ALOT longer and they can heal themselves if needed. Wizard ae nukes are generally higher so they have to cast less of them. Overall both classes are about equal. Course you always see way more druids doing this because there are about 3 times as many druids on a given sever as there are wizards.<P>Mysthyl<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>From level 39 to 45 (current) every where I've hunted I've personally seen druids quad kiting.  I.e. Dwarves in Butcherblock, various mobs in OT, and spirocs in TD.<P>Personally, I don't like seeing quad kiters...I can't stand watching a class lower in level than me kill 4 mobs at once when I expend great effort to put down one mob at a time as a magician.<P>Then again, I realize it's pure jealousy and class envy.  If I could quad kite, you bet your arse I would.  So more power to them, quad kite away!  If I want to quad kite "that" bad, i'll start up a druid.<P>But to answer the original topic starter - I've been hunting in specific high-exp yield / high spawn rate areas, which happen to also be outdoor zones very popular for leveling fast...so I'm in the areas that quad kiting can be done.  So I see it on a daily basis.<P>Again, quad kite away.  Maybe I'll do it someday...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
