</FONT><HR>Id just like to say that i dont think this nerf was actually directed at clerics. i think it was supposed to make us happier now that we get to watch druids and shaman die for healing. i really think the true intent of this is to encourage a group to have 2 healers that can ping-pong a mob back and forth as it aggros each healer. i think they are trying to bring us and our druid and shaman pals closer  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> so instead of jugling a mob with DD spells, just do it with heals now. at least we get a little more fun to do in battle now<P>Kappaphi Doomprophet<BR>35 Cleric of Rodect Nife<BR>Sayryn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I play a 36 (sometimes 35, but yesterday I stayed 36 long enough to claim the title now) Dwarven Cleric - and I have to say that I have not noticed any difference to the game. I am hunting in Velious at the Ry'Gorr Fort, and the orcs aggro me the same as before. I use Greater Heal instead of Superior - to detract from the aggro, and shorter casting time. I still get fizzles and the oh so annoying "interrupts" - something I can understand if a mob is pummeling you, but not when you are standing there doing nothing but casting a spell. And you have to wait for the end of the spell to click to see that it was interuppted. Casting a SH on a warrior who is down 3 bubs of hits, only to see him go down one more while you cast SH, only to have it interuppt and then you fizzle twice trying to get it off again. I hate it when anyone in my party dies, so I'll have to stick with GH till 39 then I'll start using SH....oh well....<P>And we need a self Invis. please! If we are gonna run all over the place to rez people, then we need a way to do it. Call it "averted eyes" or "celestial blanketing" or something - but to risk running halfway across a zone with crappy self defense and offense (esp at 35 and up where a same level green can eat you without blinking nevermind a 3 second death from a blue - and its happend to me, I know!)- No wonder high level clerics almost never answer rez calls. <P>As a thought, has anyone ever done a /who cleric &lt;level&gt; and then compared the number of players of clerics vs the other classes?<P>Just some thoughts,<BR>Axemaster Stuntycleric (Champions of Thanatos) Karana Server<P>and a BIG P.S. - I have heard that ROOT uses Charisma as a deciding factor in its lasting time?? If this is true, then its broken. I am a dwarven cleric, yes? My God is dwarven. My spells are granted by my god. Why does my god view me with the same Charisma rating as other races???? Dwarves start with around 45 Cha. As a cleric I am not going to load up on Cha enhancing items. So my root doesnt stick for more than around 3 seconds for most of the time. 1 in 10 times it will hold for the listed duration of the spell (in the EQ hints book) but mostly its less effect than a Stun. So please do something about that. Otherwise your game becomes just "pick the race with the most beneficial abilities" - celestial powers should not be based on what other people view me as, it should be how the gods look on me.<BR>Ok enough ranting</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;It's already hard enough to taunt something off of enchanters with a warrior. Rangers can take the mobs attention much better than a warrior, even with the ranger not taunting, and the warrior using some of the best weapons in the game.&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>Last year on a kaesora raid I tagged along with a group of 50 war, 52 necro, 39 druid, 49 druid, and me a lowly 30 ranger. We were in the librarian room camping while the necro would use his pet to pull to us during downtime. Needless to say the druids were spending much of their mana trying to keep me alive because SOMEHOW I would aggro more than the warrior 20 levels over me! I wasn't taunting and he was. That's just sad. <P>So the taunt problem was around before this latest patch although it may have had salt poured on the wound. Then again maybe it's not a problem...rangers are supposed to piss off the mobs. Look at it this way, maybe the hybrids actually have more use at high levels now as opposed to groups always opting for warriors. Now maybe they'll look for a warrior AND a hybrid.<P>a retired ranger</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Actually.  this is all the Rangers & Druids fault.<P>Think about it.  Rangers whine that they can't get groups.  Verant "fixes" Cleric agro so now you MUST have a ranger in the group to pull critter off Cleric.  Druids complain they can't get groups and want better healing.  Verant gives them better healing and then changes the agro so now you MUST have a druid ( ok, or Shammy ) to act as second healer for the cleric.<P>In one fell swoop Verant has silenced the Ranger / Druid "I can't get a group" whines.<P>Of course now you MUST have a warrior, MUST have a cleric, MUST have a chanter, MUST have a ranger, MUST have a druid / shammy, MUST have monk ( FD pulling ). hmm.  thats 6 MUSTS.  Max group size is 6.  Oh well, screw you paly, sk, mage, wizzy, bard, rogue, we can't fit you into our group......<P>Kind of pathetic when you think about it.  As much as they protest when people doubt there "experience" playing they really don't seem to have a clue.  <P>Verants entire defense for this untested, unasked for disaster is "well, just try it, we're sure you'll learn to work around it, after a few hundred deaths and you lose 6 levels and pay us another $30 for the privledge of re-earning them in twice the time due to harder rules"  I still say if they are going to throw a change out of this potential magnitude UNTESTED they should remove xp loss for 48-96 hours from the game so we can BETA test it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'd like to know where on earth the idea that healing should taunt more came from at all.. And why it wasn't tested thoroughly on test port, but then maybe it was and you didn't listen to the worries there, have heard quite a few stories of people playing there reporting bugs then seeing them come in next patch anyway.. This is a biggy though and not a bug, why not get some of your people and test it yourself first? That's what's really needed on these things and it saves an awful lot of trouble for you just testing it a couple of days.<P>Another side of it is that you seem to have tried to make crowd control difficult in velious, then you've turned around and made it so that it's going to basically be a joke trying to do multiples without crowd control.. Or you trying to get tanks to all go to seperate mobs on multiple pulls now? So groups have to be made up of three people who can actually tank and taunt, and three healers going oom each fight as each tank has to basically solo each of their mobs. Is the vision a complete lack of people being able to be efficient and use tactics? Would certainly work well for you if people actually stuck around for it.. Going to take quite some time for people to get to 60 to get tired of the game if everyone goes oom each fight and can only do low blues at high level like this. Can't see this working though guys.<P>Here's my suggestion.. Fix it once and in one go, bug test it properly before you implement it and get plenty of feedback from testers then just leave it alone, people will settle into their role or if they don't like their class role they'll play another one. Listen to the people who play each class closely and with a very open mind while you're doing it, they're the ones with the experience in game and they're your best bet at getting it right. And whatever you do, stop trying to use the main servers as a beta test for things, it drives everyone nuts and quite simply isn't fair on the players.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I honestly don't understand why people are so worked up about this "shadowing" thing.  How is it an invasion of privacy? All they are doing is standing around and watching you swing a weapon or cast a spell.  If someone was watching you rake leaves in your front yard to see if they could improve their technique, would it be an invasion of privacy?  Moreover, it's a public domain so they have the right to watch you.  And if they are doing it to improve gameplay and evaluate their decisions why are you complaining?  You complain about the change and then complain when they say they are watching to see how it works.  Obviously they don't have the manpower to test every single situation, so they devise alternatives, one of which is watching other players.  What's wrong with that?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060996-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060996.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=060996&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=060996&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
