</FONT><HR>If Foh in oblivion Verant &gt; FOH &gt; EQ.  Ergo, Verant = EQ &gt; FOH.<P>No one is irreplacable.<P>It's a game. <P>If you want any real worth go out and do charity work, get involved in politics, raise a family and get them in good colleges while not losing your ability to be kind to others.<P>Everything you do is dust in the wind in the real world- even more so in EQ.  In 2 years, people will be doing all the big stuff and no one will even remember FOH if you leave.<P>I honestly can't see any way that your leaving hurts the other 2450 ppl on your server.  And disregarding all the other uber crap at least it reduces the surplus population by 50.  And within a month, your numbers will be replaced and the server will be back to 2500.<P>EQ is the best game out there.  Verant has done some reprehensible things changing rules after folks commit lots of time to them.  As a referee myself tho, I can understand why they have to do some of this.  If donal's bp is required to do much of the new content and 3% of the players have them, then more of their customers are going to be unhappy with the game.  For a long time they catered to the ubers, imho.  But perhaps they woke up and said, "Good god- these guys consume tons of bandwidth, pump lots of treasure into the economy, and even drive some other customers away.  Why are we catering to these guys?"<P>Personally-- until a new game comes out, I'd bet 10 bucks you guys will be playing in 4 weeks.<P>You leave the game and realize just how much it was important to you and they'll partially unnerf clerics and you'll come right back.<P>This is why I'm really looking forward to shadowbane etc.  You'll leave for at least a few months and then maybe the rest of us get to play EQ.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>But FoH DOES own Eq. Kil had it right. They beat the game, defeating mobs Verant thought impossible to beat (Inte anyone?), and zones they were not meant to challenge for many months (ST) and so verant struck out by nerfing every single thing they do. It's not just FoH that is upset; it's the vast majority of 50+ players either ubers or not.<P>There are a lot of guilds like mine out there - big enough that we destroy VS and trak with ease, but not good enough to do Velk or the SoV epic encounters. We're the guilds that are 2, 4, or 6 months behind them. But where there are only a handful of true uber guilds, there are dozens of guilds like mine. 2, 3, 4, 5 even on some servers. And every server has our guilds. And we're looking at FoH, AL, Da'Kor, and LoS, and thinking... "if they can't do it, how can we?"<P>These are the guilds that have ALWAYS found a way to beat the odds, and do the things in this game that were considered impossible, and there are a lot of players who wish they could be like them. Is there a single server that has not seen Nagafen or Vox die? What about Trakanon or Venril Sathir? If people didn't want to be like FoH, they wouldn't kill these mobs. They'd be content to kill 27 kinds of bat, and 2 dozens kinds of rat. They'd be happy camping their safe spawns in outdoor zones, 30 feet from the boundary, paying druids to sow them in case they have to run for it. But some people want more. They get to high levels, and realize they are less powerful than when they started the game, relative to their environment. So they form large guilds, to do things that can't be done solo, or in a group of six, or 12, or 20. They conquer the planes, they kill the dragons, they slay the gods. It happens sooner or later on every server, even the PvP servers.<P>When guilds like FoH pack it in, it starts a ripple effect that slowly spreads throughout the rest of the EQ universe. It's a sign that what we all wanted can't be found in this game, and it's time to look elsewhere. And it's not just the top 1%. Sooner or later, you'll all either quit, or break 50 and start looking for something more interesting than the bats in sol b.<P>shazariahl, 57 wizard of 7th hammer.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>hahahahaha...<P>FoH Member&gt;&gt;&gt; I started this game to play with my boy friend and join him in FoH. After playing for 6 months. I am now in foh and have been for about two months. My character is a Dark Elf Female warrior level 59.<P>- hahah Silver Spooned if ive ever seen one, gee no wonder you dont find the game fun anymore, i wish i got silverspooned and pampered like you.<P><BR>FoH Member&gt;&gt;&gt; You can say that this game does not matter at higher levels because I will never be a higher level. Well you can't stop leveling till you hit 60 so more then likely someday you will be 60 or at least past 50. Lets hope you can get past 50.<P>- "lets hope you can get past 50" just because you were brought up with a silverspoon and had an "all access pass" to PhatLewts, doesnt mean other people cant level.<P>FoH Member&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyways my point is every stratgey we do is always fixed in the next patch so we can not do that stratgey again by verant. It gets old and fustraing. I am sure you will see lots of guilds going next patch and it does not surprise me. I know i will be gone<P>- GREAT! leave, no one would really give a crap anyway, all your "kind" with your egos need to be checked, cause you know you are "uber" in a videogame! that will get those real life jobs a flowin!<P>FoH Member&gt;&gt;&gt; For those of you that say good bye well. Like the guy who made the thread there will be no more people to test the game. At least not the good players.<P>- hahah, "at least not the good players" thats funny, just because your in an "uber guild" does not make you that good or that all your kind are the best of the best, if you or any uberguild people leave that will make everyones lives alittle better<P>note: i played on veeshan once for 6 hours, i got sick and tired of all those damned serverwide messages saying when one of FoH's members took a crap or whatever, no wonder everyone has heard about FoH, because they gotta listen to all the crap you do like once every 30 minutes, keep feeding those egos</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Funny how jealousy affects some people. Every single malicious post directed at FOH, was really unnecessary. They're leaving, wish them well. <P>Foh had a huge impact on this game. No doubt about it. Will somebody take their place? Definately. Maybe even (gasp) you. <P>They were full time players, so what? All the people telling them to get a life, secretly wanted to be like them; play full time, without a seeming care in the world. Why else, would a happy person, supposedly happy with their job, be upset about somebody that probably has no girlfriend, and never leaves the house?<P>If you're happier than them, why do you need to insult them? Simple, because only unhappy people belittle the accomplishments of others.<P>What Foh accomplished in this game (EQ) is nothing short of amazing. Yes, for the uninformed, many items and encounters in this game was changed, because of FOH. Will we miss them? Probably not. Guilds will come and go. There are tons of guilds looking to take FOH's place. And, believe it or not, Verant will design the game according to their abilities. <P>The problem is, something much deeper than you would think. See, in Verants quest for ultimate balance, we're ALL beta testors, thus, all expendable. What they're telling you is they have no loyalty whatsoever to how long you've played this game. They don't care if you quit or not, because, most people don't delete a character that they've played for 2+ years. They either give it to a friend, or sell it. Either way, the account will continue to be paid for.<P>Oh, and add all the new players, and accounts that never stop getting paid for, and you see EQ's customer base actually getting larger. you may see the day that EQ has 2 million subscribers, but only 20,000 actual players. The same new players that are insulting the veteran players now, will be in the exact same position 2 years hence. <P>Don't worry about FOH quitting, worry about yourself.<P>Throes<BR>Phantasmist<BR>The Harmonium<BR>Xev</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ROFL.  Trileya, you are a classic example of what I was talking about in a different thread.  You HONESTLY believe that the EQ world revolves around you and your uber friends.  Let me reiterate.  It most assuredly DOES NOT.  NO ONE CARES ABOUT Tigole leaving.  No one cares about Furor and his egotistical tripe.  No one, that is, outside of the uber circle.  You are irrelevant to me, as is whether you leave or stay.  That goes double for all the clerics, every single bloody one of them, who have quit over the aggro nerf.  <P>You people don't matter.  Your departure signals neither a renaissance or a death knell.  It signals nothing at all other than maybe you'll finally get a life.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If FoH has beaten the game then maybe they should move on. Maybe EQ could create the uber plane where they can all go and have a nice big graphical chat room. Then the rest of the game could be designed and play-balanced for the rest of us. I have no urge to play EQ more than 10 hours a week at most - it is a fun game though. Now that the people who were playing it every hour possible have one it (congrats there) may they move on and let the others have a crack at it. <P>If this is the end then it is the end for those who have played this game into the ground, not for me. Relax and enjoy yourselves. Maybe they can add your characters as the Guild NPC trainers or something so we will know who you were. <P>I would personally love to see them close down the servers for a month, revamp content and quests and start anew. Being level 15 with a minatuar axe and leather armour might not be so bad as a refresher.<P>If you really think that FoH has beaten EQ then save your $10 and celebrate your victory in Mirc. What is painful is that the victory is hollow - the game for 2 years seemed to be open ended but it is not - there is a cap. <P>As far as does FoH and their ilk hurt the game question, the only major problem I see is the awkward attempts at balancing a game amongst those who play 5, 10 , 20 , 40 and 80 hours a week. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1) Uber guilds do not make up 5 - 10 % of the EQ population. They make up 0.1 % of the EQ population. If they leave there will be almost ZERO impact on the game.<P>2) I loved your comment about the effect on the economy. It couldn't be more wrong if you tried. Uber guilds never put ANY items into the economy. In fact they server to reduce the items in the economy by hoarding all the god items for their twinked characters. They destroy all items of inferior quality. They NEVER sell anything.<P>3) Your comment about uber guilds discovering problems with game mechanics is even more hilarious. What they do is cheat by exploiting. Then the rest of us pay becasue Verant has to get out the nerf stick to keep them from cheating. They are not finding bugs; they are taking advantage of loopholes in the rules.<P>4) There are 330,000 subscribers to this game. How can Furor leaving have ANY IMPACT on the game?

I ended up playing on a Server where only one of those friends plays and I didn't join a Guild until I was around Level 20.  In nine months of playing, I have a Level 36 Cleric, a Level 35 Paladin and a Level 21 Warrior.<P>By the descriptions given by FoH members, the predominent encounters they do REQUIRE uber-equipment.  Therefore, any FoH member who goes on these encounters HAS uber-equipment.  Therefore Lidlia HAS uber-equipment.<BR>As Lidlia was NOT there when FoH first started, nor was she there when FoH had pretty-much outgrown 90% of the Kunark encounters, it is a logical assumption that she was GIVEN at least some of her gear.<BR>It is further a logical assumption that she was given guild assistance (read: powerleveled) throughout a large portion of her career.<P>Pestilnse vs. Lidlia, point #1 - Reasonable viewpoint from Pestilnse, if slightly insulting.<P><BR>Pestilnse wrote: "FoH Member&gt;&gt;&gt; You can say that this game does not matter at higher levels because I will never be a higher level. Well you can't stop leveling till you hit 60 so more then likely someday you will be 60 or at least past 50. Lets hope you can get past 50.<P>- "lets hope you can get past 50" just because you were brought up with a silverspoon and had an "all access pass" to PhatLewts, doesnt mean other people cant level."<P>Lidlia's comment WAS insulting, however the reply does not strike at the core of her comment.  My characters have not gained levels as fast as the other members of my Guild.  Why?  Because I do Quests.  Because I Explore.  Because I spend HUGE amounts of time helping others.  I'd like to think that THIS was the core of Verant's "Vision", not the endless chasing of Levels and Loot.<P>Pestilnse vs. Lidlia, point #2 - I think they both missed the idea of real enjoyment in the game.<P><BR>Pestilnse wrote: "FoH Member&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyways my point is every stratgey we do is always fixed in the next patch so we can not do that stratgey again by verant.

I know i will be gone<P>- GREAT! leave, no one would really give a crap anyway, all your "kind" with your egos need to be checked, cause you know you are "uber" in a videogame! that will get those real life jobs a flowin!"<P>I agree with Lidlia's main comment... but look at it this way.  Do you REALLY want a game where you KNOW that EVERY TIME you walk into Veeshan's Peak that you and your friends will do "thus-and-so" and win?  EVERY TIME?  I agree that at some point the "challenge" becomes rediculous and the nerfs become insane... but do you REALLY want the PacMan-like "follow this exact pattern through the maze and you'll clear it automatically"?  In that same vein, I quit hunting Goblins in Highkeep because they got BORING!  Once you know the spawn rate and the general pathing, you CAN'T be beaten unless someone trains you!<P>Pestilnse vs. Lidlia, point #2 - Pestilnse loses points for not seeing the point, Lidlia loses points for not seeing the potential.<P><BR>Pestilnse wrote: "FoH Member&gt;&gt;&gt; For those of you that say good bye well.

This comment implies that ANYONE not in an Uber-Guild is NOT a good player.<BR>Thank you very much.<BR>Surprisingly enough... after never having read someone else's tactics, and never having seen a raid on Lucan in person, I was able to draft a complete tactical attack plan that not only enabled us to kill Lucan, but to kill a large number of guards too.  The only loss was a person who didn't follow the plan.  Oh, and the only person who was above Level 50 was a Cleric who was the RL mother of the Paladin we were setting this up for.<BR>Do you REALLY believe that only the people in Uber-Guilds are good players?<BR>If that's your opinion, then let me get the door for you... I don't want you slowing down to open it yourself.<P>Pestilnse vs. Lidlia, point #3 - Pestilnse wins, clearly.<P><BR>One last thing... Throes wrote: "Every single malicious post directed at FOH, was really unnecessary. They're leaving, wish them well."<BR>In response, I say:  Anyone's "holier-than-thou" posts and statements are ABSOLUTELY unnecessary and DESERVING of being shot down.<P>If you're the best, then prove it by doing things... and above all, never say "I'm the best."

</FONT><HR>***<BR>So lets say the bulk of the "Uber Guilds leave" now we have a game that will take longer for problems and mechanics to be solved.<BR>***<BR>Actually I think this is false. What really would happen is that Verant would have longer to take a look at the problems and mechanics. By the ubers running in and trying to kill things pretty much as fast as Verant can create them, is puts Verant in a bad spot. It puts them in the position of having to rush to change/fix something instead of being able to address each proplem in a methodical professional manner. Thus the numerous "knee jerk" type fixes you see implemented.<P><BR>***<BR>The people us newer players look up to will be few and far between, yes even though you might not like a guild the fact they can kill a rare dragon etc is something to be in awe of. <BR>***<BR>If anyone is in "awe" of a toon, they need to seriously take an introspective look at themselves. Its a game, to idolize another player is silly, they are nobody special, in most cases they are a slightly overweight, pimply faced teenager with serious problems in the socials skills area. Take a look around in real life, you will find much better people to look up to if you need a role model.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

That means you must have had a rusty weapon until at least level 5, kept in raw silk or worse until level 8, didnt have a meaningful piece of jewelry until at least level 12, never uber-buffed by a guild member before the age of 8.  THATS earning everything yourself.  Honestly, I would find it hard to believe your hubby and his friends would allow you to go through that frustration.  If so, kudos to you.<P>In agreement with others before me, I also find it sad that people are in awe and wonderment of thee so called "uber-players".  The only thing making them uber is the ability to spend countless hours on end in one sitting.  Frankly, if given a one on one duel, with the exact weapon, armor, jewelry, age, and so forth, I'll place my bet on someone who has not had the benefits of being in one of these so-called "uber guilds".  They've been through many more hardships, have literally clawed their way to their level, instead of being spoon fed with a little help from their friends.  My guess is they have encountered more difficult, almost impossible odds to get where they are.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I'll be honest, some guy I never met once shouted "Anyone want the Klij plans?" in FV.  I happened to be there and shouted back "I would, I could use them for my Ro Armour quest."  So he gave them to me.  I cast my wimpy Paladin-buffs on him and thanked him graciously.<BR>So, did I earn the Boots of Ro?  (Try getting all the stuff you need for Ronium... the answer is "Yes, five times over.")<P>Leaving that aside...  How often before level 47 did you have a practically guaranteed xp-res if you died?  In my guild there are exactly three Clerics above 39, and only one above 49.  I know EXACTLY how valuable xp-res is.<P>You say you didn't start regularly grouping with FoH guild members until 47...<BR>As a self-proclaimed expert in semantics, that leaves HUGE holes in your arguement.  After all, you DON'T group with the Enchanter/Druid/Cleric who is powerleveling you.<P>I am NOT accusing you of any of these things.  I am only pointing out how EASY it is to draw these conclusions.<P>The average player does NOT reach level 57 in six months.  The average player doea NOT reach level 47 in four months.  The average player does NOT go from level 47 to level 57 in two months. (These numbers are reached by taking the statements of: 1) Having played six months; 2) Being level 57 now; 3) Having grouped regularly with FoH after level 47; and 4) Having done #3 for two months before actually becoming a member of the Guild.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>FoH better than VI?<P>Um...*looks on his box of Everquest*<P>I see no FoH on the box.<P>*logs in to play EQ*<P>/w all "Fire of Heaven<P>*screen reads "There are no player by that name*<BR>*goes about kill more mobs*<P>If FoH does leave, then oh well.  If FoH stays then, oh well.  But FoH better than VI?  Please, get real.  Out of 300K active account, do you really think FoH matters?  Bah, get real.<P>Now as to the destruction of the game.  Yes, I think VI is really messing up the game for the population as a whole.  They are attempting to "balance" the classes, and have so far done an OK job.  Not a good job, just an ok job.  As far as the "tweaking" of the higher level mobs?  Now they are going to far.  If the barbarian that drops the Fishbone Earing hasn't wisened up and hired a couple gaurds to guard his butt, then why would any NPC suddenly "get harder".  Lame.  Goes along the same lines as NO DROP.  More and more, nice items are NO DROP.  Why?  VI deemed them to great to be in the hands of everyone.  Yeah, like them Gnoll Fangs in BB.  Mmmmm...Uber.  Lets make them NO DROP.  Oh well.  Done venting.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>In Lidlia's defense:<P>Nobody had heard of her in guild until she started raiding with us in her 50's. She did not have better gear than a single person could have acquired with sufficient resources. In fact, from our perspective her gear was so mediocre that we gave her the worst of the loot from our encounters (nobody else wanted it) and it was an improvement for her.<P>She is not the most well spoken member of FoH, and nobody should expect her to be. We are a collection of roughly 40-60 individuals (with differing opinions) led by a brilliant general (egocentricities and all). We are not a united front. We do not have internal guild censorship. We are not all selfish ignorant children (average age would be in the early 20's). <P>There are a few things we have in common. We are driven. We are intelligent. We are very experienced. We are very knowledgeable (concerning EQ game dynamics).<P>People mistakenly assume that they know something that we have not tried. When we are fed up and declare the high level game broken, we really mean it. We are not idly ranting because we are spoiled brats. We have worked very hard for everything we have accomplished.<P>Lidlia is angry. I can easily understand why. When we work very hard for what we have accomplishsed and come to let Verant know that they made a mistake, it hurts (and I mean really hurts) to have our accomplishments and troubles thrown back into our face by other players that do not know us, what we did to accomplish our feats, or even what we are talking about. Most of our guild does not require recognition by other players (I will admit that there are a few, including our illustrious leader), but the anger and hostility on these boards toward our guild (and our kind -&gt; uber guilds) is unfounded and illogical considering what we know.<P>There's no point to taking Lidlia apart piece by piece; you are most probably missing the realization that Verant already did that for you.<P>[60 Phantasmist] Lelaniel (High Elf) &lt;Fires of Heaven&gt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Are you all very rich, with no worries, and can play the required 8-12 hours a day?<P>All I can say is count all the played time of all your characters then add them all together.  Then ask yourself, what could I have accomplished in the 2 or 3 years that I have been inside the Eq world.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> Wow!

</FONT><HR>Lelanial,<P>You seem to lack the arrogance the other recent uber posters have had so let me explain.<P>The very existence of guilds like FOH ruins the game for most other players in the game.<P>When an encounter can barely be beaten by the average population and a guild like FOH repeatedly defeats in within minutes of spawning, Verant responds (reasonbly) by increasing the difficulty of the encounter.  Now it may not be defeatable by most of the players.  And then FOH defeats it again- and again- and again.  Until for the most part the encounter is made so difficult that only an FOH type guild -CAN- beat it.<P>Now- given enough time most of us will have better equipment- but since FOH types play 10-12 hours a day while the rest of us are zombies at work after a 6 hour day, it will be quite some time IF the ubers were to leave now and start letting ordinary players get some of the better items.  But they don't leave- they dont' respect calendars- and so the average players not only can't defeat the tougher encounters now but it is going to be impossible to defeat them six months from now as long as the Ubers scarf up every uber item and use that power to plunder other guilds of the premium classes.<P>Now- if you guys had "played nice" with the rest of the folks and respected calendars, given everyone a fair shot and been heros, folks would be rooting for you but you didn't.  You pretty much walked over folks because you could.  You threatened folks who were going to PNP into your L60 necro's solo frenzied ghoul camp with "never seeing the planes".  Maybe not you personally (from you post you don't seem the type).  But enough of you on enough servers so that when you threaten to quit because Verant made it more difficult for you, we not only don't feel a whit of sympathy for you but by gum, we'd be happy if you just darn well left so Verant would stop turning the screws on the rest of us trying to get to you.<P>And lastly, the point many have made.  We dont' know you.  You never ever group with us or if you did- it was in the 30's and when we say "hi" to you at 51, you give us a cold shoulder.  You only associate with uber players and let us know how we were only stepping stones to get to where you are.<P>And more commonly- you don't rez folks except for money- you don't walk around giving out free clarities or sows.  You don't chat with folks outside of your tightly knit circle.  In short, you contribute nothing to your servers, yet you take up space and loot and many of you cop attitudes like lydia.  <P>We know you are no better players than thousands of us- Hell I regularly come upon folks who break things in different ways than your notes (and some of them are a damn site more fun if not more efficient that the military bland style stuff you come up with).  What you do possess for the most part is just lots of time-- and the ability to dump your buds who don't make it into the uber guild with you.<P>These are not very aweinspiring or inspiring.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064228-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064228.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/064228-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=064228&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=064228&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
