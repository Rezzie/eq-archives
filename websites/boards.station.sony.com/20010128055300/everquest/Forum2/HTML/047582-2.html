</FONT><HR>Gnert:<P>Here is the email reply we received regarding Ragefire poofing from the lead GM on our server:<P>********<BR>        Greetings, I would like to first take the time to apologize for the trouble that you and your guild has expierienced in taking on Ragefire.<BR>Unfortunately I cannot discuss all of the details why the item was not<BR>reimbursed a second time to your guildmate but I can remind you that killing a monster while linkdead is not a bug and it is not something that we reimburse items for.<P>Sincerely,<BR>Jeremy Albert <BR>Axgoreth the Mighty<BR>Lead Gm-Administrator / Everquest<BR>Verant Interactive / Sony Online Entertainment<BR>**********<P>So...killing a monster while linkdead is not a bug, therefore corpse poofing (even Ragefire) is not a bug, therefore nothing can be reimbursed.<P>This is patently ridiculous.  The GM obviously has his hands tied, and I can't fault him: he has his rules to work by.  However, regardless of how corpse poofing is currently classified by the over-worked Verant developers, this is *NOT* an acceptable response.<P>I have suggested several possible corrections for linkdeath resulting in corpse poofs.  The simplist as far as I can see is to have an option to disable post-linkdeath AI (I.E.: you can choose to have yourself become inactive when you go linkdead instead of becoming an NPC and fighting).  <P>Whatever: losing hundreds of person-hours of effort to a "feature" is absolutely not acceptable.<P>Paeter</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

As well as many many other clerics on other servers.  All of them deserve and should have reimbursal of their lost quest pieces, and some kind of assurance that they can continue on with their quest.

I couldn't give a **** if I don't meelee/cast on going LD, in the high end game it won't save me anyway.

</FONT><HR>Noor:<P>I believe we received the Shimmering Pearl after the first corpse poof because we were lucky and got a GM who recognized that the problem existed.<P>The second time, we got a Lead GM who was following the letter of the law, which is: Its not an officially recognized bug, therefore it must be player error, therefore no refunds.<P>The reason we tried the second time without a GM present was, quite frankly, because we honestly believed the problem was "rare".  We also thought that patch that week (last Tuesday) had some anti-corpse poofing code in it: Absor had indicated as much in the one "Ragefire poofing!" thread that he did reply to (see thread: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045210.html)<P>With 20/20 hindsight, we should have had a GM present.  And next time we will endeavour to do so.  However, one other thread where a GM was present during a poof resulted in...nothing.  The GM didn't replace the shimmering pearl.  <P>By the way, have you ever tried to coordinate a GM presence to observe a "possible" bug during a raid with thirty people?  &lt;snicker&gt;<P>Paeter</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There is no excuse for Verant to not take the time to go through their logs. An Epic quest, like the Cleric quest, does not just comprise of 30 people killing one NPC. There are quite a few steps along the way, several of them requiring groups of similar size. You are looking at multiple hundreds of man hours, by players, to complete one Epic. For an event of such magnitude, involving so many different players over an extended period of time, it is a slap in the face to tell us you can not spend an hour or two (if that long, most likely much less) going through logs to help those customers.<P>It appears to be the 'trend' now that the GM staff will not look at server logs to help with Epic quest issues. We have a warrior in our guild who has the same issue. No, not Ragefire 'poofing', obviously. But the same end result, their epic being lost. They turned in their final pieces of the quest, expecting to receive the scabbard. Instead they were handed a note, and then the scabbard. The note was handed first, thus taking up the only open slot...and thus the scabbard was lost. Mattez has shown the lead GM that he has the note, which can only be obtained by completing the quest, and has asked the GM to reimburse the item. The GM refuses to believe he completed it, and Rhuyai refuses to take a moment to check server logs to verify that he did indeed do the quest.<P>These types of problems are expected to exist in a dynamic game such as Everquest. That is not the issue. It's the total lack of customer service people are receiving when these issues occur that disturbs me.<P>Quil Ak'arna<BR>Bertoxx</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Thanks everyone for your continued support.<P>I have received an email from one of the GM's who responded to our petition that night (the second evening) Lead GM Axgoreth. <P>I wont put his entire letter here as its very long but I will quote the last paragraph here;<P>"However I am afraid that the Ragefire corpse poofing and being out of anyones control twice is Highly unlikely therefore the Item will not be<BR>reimbursed because there are no logs that we have that actually could prove that he was killed by a linkdead player and that noone was present during<BR>the battle to see if the corpse did indeed poof instantly. Again, I sympathize for your situation and wish that there was more I could do to aid<BR>you in this manner. "<P>I'll let you people read that and draw your own conclusions.<P>We had 30+ people there, we killed Zordak and there was no corpse. Somehow Verant can check the 'logs' for almost everything under the sun however they cant check it to see things like:<P>a) Zarux was linkdead<BR>b) Zarux got the killing blow<BR>c) no corpse was generated<BR>d) I didnt have zordaks heart<BR>e) no one had zordaks heart<BR>f) no dragon loot was had at all <P>Unfortunately I find this preposterous. Some of those items we ALL KNOW from personal experience must be tracked. For instance if you go linkdead and try to log back in the server tells you "You currently have an active character on that server" and wont let you back in.<P>Also the server puts a [LD] above your name. These are two separate actions the server takes that specifically show that it acknowledges you are linkdead. <P>Now I have never seen a Verant server log but it wouldnt be out of the realm of possibility to suggest that it includes things like who killed a monster, who looted what, and things like that. <P>In fact once I petitioned because a Shralok Pack and all its contents had poofed from my inventory.

</FONT><HR>Badina's pearl is important.<P>But more important (sorry, Bad!) is the recognition by Verant of corpse poofing as a *flaw* in the game design that must be corrected.<P>First, Verant should admit that epic monsters should not poof when killed by linkdead players.  <P>Second, they should authorize GMs to take corrective actions such as replacing pearls lost to poofing.  If necessary, they should visibly disable the Ragefire spawning NPC while the problem is corrected.  <P>Third, they should recode the logic associated with corpse poofing.  The necessary result could also be achieved by changing PCs so that we can choose to disable AI combat during link death (I.E.: so that we stand and die when we go LD instead of fighting).<P>I do not believe that the EverQuest community is willing to accept the current "losing epic monsters to linkdead PCs is not a bug" explanation.  It is both inadequate, and insulting.<P>Paeter</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Nor should correcting this problem be assigned a low priority.  Every incident has dozens of unhappy and frustrated players behind it.  People who, from a single incident, lose hundreds of played hours of effort.<P>Yet we have received no reply even admitting the problem exists.<P>Apparently, other concerns such as class balance issues take a priority over this.

I say I'm sorry because it seems to be receiving nothing less than zero attention from teh people it is addressed to (verant).<P>Basically, what it amounts to is a GM willing to completely disbelieve 30+ people when they explain to him what happened.  Given the excuse that something is 'highly unlikely' is simply not good enough. It was 'highly unlikely' that our next president of the United States would be determined by under 10,000 people in Florida.  It is highly unlikely that Ruthie Bergman will win the Big Game Lottery in Peoria Ill, but these things can happen and are NOT impossible.  Two times Ragefire was killed by a LD player and two times the corpse poofed.<P>Badina deserves her pearl, Verant needs to make this not happen again in the future.<P>Teiravalon Danu<BR>Bertox Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
