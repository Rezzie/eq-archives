</FONT><HR>You know, a lot of people complain about their mages. Heck, people seem to complain about whatever class they are playing at the time. Now I have my complaints, not about mages or any other class, but about the way Verant deals with people.<P>But as to the mages. At level 44, my top pet quad strikes for 48 points per cycle, plus a nuke, my bottom pet quads for 40 plus a nuke. On top of that, with a 200 int I can chain cast over 4200 hp worth of nuke damage in less than a minute. That is just two spells, nuke and pet. And we have other spells.<P>Think about that, 6 level 44 mages will have  26,400 hp worth of nuke damage that they can cast in less than a minute. Then add the pets in. How many hp does Vox have? Do we really need any other class?<P>If you want to complain about pet graphics or Verants obvious lack of creativity for the mage class or Verants continued disinterest in general player concerns that is something to understand. If you want to complain about most other people not understanding just how much mages can bring to a group, that is something to understand as well. <P>But complaining about the power of a mage? Come on.<P>Brin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Mytheos &gt;&gt; "I could be wrong, but as for Mages being able to out-do Wizards in a single shot of Damage? Well, Disinergrate...Instant Kill. Cant really beat that...and Wizards also have a 1,600 Point DD. What Mage spell outdoes that?"<P>Disintegrate destroys the target if successful for the cost of a 20pp regent. There is no mob left behind to loot or get xp from. Its a 60 drop limited to low blue mobs think its 52 or lower <BR>if i'm not mistakn. By the time you get it its useless. Some uber guilds use the spell to clear placeholders when camping.<P>Sunstrike(1600 dd) looks impressive again lvl 60ish upgrade to ice comet. In its own real Ice Comet was really impressive but that percentage of dmg effeciency is destroyed in the expansions. At the level you get it you'll see a good bunch o fizzles when aggro managment against such high mobs is imperitive because they have a big heat touch usually and for casters that means instadeath.<P>*Put Simply*  Who contributes more when completly  out of mana?  Mage or wizard?  Providing a group with a healer or even no healer vs a single mob a mage provides more because he gets offensive DDs as well as defense with a pet to tank and mages have really nice AEs post 50 too. A wizard becomes a paperweight for 12 mins or so when oom.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Sure for one short fight you do alot of damge but when your oom the necro is 75% mana and throwing 1500dd thats over two of your spells and at 55+ lvl they will get there damage in. with an enc if you count the extra damage melee do becuase of there spell they do the most damage of all people in a group np. and as far as pets go who care at 55+ your in a group your pets dont take damage so your extra hp your pet has does not mean anything.

</FONT><HR><P>I have seen mage pets eat though necro pets like butter in duels.<P>I have also seen mages resist many DOTs and still deliver good damage with zChar and other short time to cast DDs.<P>In a duel its about even after Level 50.<P>As far has who is more useful in a raid.. I see no reason to take either Mage or Necro.  I happen to think a necro is marginally more useful for giving his/her's mana/heslth to others.<P>The Mage pet however is a viable melee addition and can be recast.  So in truth the necro will NOT out-damage the mage.

Just to name a few.<BR>    Best advise to you is make a Cleric, Enchanter, and Monk for the long Haul to 60.best bet for Soloing is Shamen,Druid and Nec.<P>   Arcer   55 Conjurer   Liner 51 Vicar<BR>     </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>   Talking to 60. At higher lvl's Shamen really Rock. Best solo Class.You hit the nail on the head about Cleric's are the most boring class. Always have the TV going in the back ground.But for getting group's. Enchanter's and Cleric's have very easy times getting group's. To do just about anything at above 50th lvl. You have to have a Cleric and Chanter.You can get by with out a Monk but having one for pull's really makes thing's go smoother.Nec though kind of troubles me putting on here.At high lvl they really get the shaft being reduced to mana batteries.Just like you said.They really change from a Domiant class at lower lvl's to a support class at higher.Though with all the differnt spell's Nec have is still a worth while class to play all the way to 60.<BR>    Arcer 55 Conjurer    Liner 51 Vicar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>LM mages are broken!!!<BR>How on earth do you come up with that idea?<BR>Broken? Jeesh the mind boggles at what people<BR>think an unbroken class is. If mages are broken then so is every other class.<P>Broken? Such a strong word for such a powerful class. As to soloing mages can solo easily at least as far as I have (54) I cannot see why it would stop. Yes there is down time, but if there was no down time soloing well it would be silly.<P>Groups, I do not know why groups do not like you at 51, mage pets so own it is not even funny. Group with a team, make sure you get the best pet (quad 58) burn it out and then here the gasps and cries of dismay from the tanks as the pet rips the mobs appart.<P>Mages are not broken in fact if anything we are too powerful. I have not said that before but I am getting so fed up of the whiners who say we are weak etc that I have to say the truth. I have logged (you know actually proof not just it looks like the pet is not doing much) quite a few fights and the pet does so much more damage than melees it is not funny.<P>Lvl 54 water pet vs 2 mobs in the hole<BR>Pet did 5000 damage<BR>lvl 49 warrior fbss sarnak skull crusher, vikks defender did 1700 damage<BR>lvl 47 paladin did 700 damage.<P>Now this does not include the pet nuking and as mob was summoned the fact that the swords where also proccing.<P>Mages are broken NOT.<P>If you wanted to balance the mage class vs other classes you would have to take away our DD, give us a little better pet heal and then we would be relatively balanced.<P>Ever see a hi lvl mage go through a low lvl dungeon? we go through unlike any other class. Even necros can slaughter everything the way mages can. With pet regen jibaner comes out of killing 6 mobs at 93% health. A warrior would have been beaten down more.<P>Mages rock, we are over powered and I am happy being over powered but if you keep complaining, in the end verant will investigate and realize we are totaly over powered and then we will be nerfed with the BIG nerf stick :-)<P>Arios lvl 54 mage (all this without cafeine)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Firepet (52) Sucks (I guess the other one we get sucks to?).<BR>2.  Our DDs are not that great considering mana use and time to cast.<BR>3.  We have no defensive spells cept for gate.<BR>4.  The pet spells post 51 will cost ya 5k+ pp if your not able to camp for them cause your not with an "Uber" guild (oh and Water Pet.. hehe.. its going for like 20k on my server).<P>Are we overpowered.  No we are not.. not at all.  Whoever thinks we are is nuts.  We do well for what we have and I love the class but these issues plus the fact that the MOBs in SoV and planes have 100K+ HPs sometimes really assures that we are NOT at ALL overpoowed.  If we get a spell nerf or another pet nerf I know i won't be doing anything but making a twink thats some other class.<P>From what I can tell we are more balanced then we have been in the past but we need some tiny increase in power I think or some more defence abilities.<P><BR>Rthen Majere<BR>Level 53 Elementalist<BR>Saryrn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi LordM,<BR>You say we are not over powered, which other classes have you played / know well.<P>I am wondering if we have a miss understanding.<BR>Now when I say over powered I mean when compared<BR>to other classes. I am thinking when you hear<BR>over powered you mean compared to mobs which of<BR>course we are not but how ever we are enough in general.<P>To your points<BR>1. Oh yes the fire pet sucks so bad :-( aye i have<BR>yet to find any excuse to use it. On a funny not though, I dueled a lvl 48 warrior with this pet, straight pet to warrior and the pet owned the warrior, kind of embaressing but you are right this pet is for owning lvl 8 mobs as far as I can tell :-(<BR>2. Scars is nice at 54, 2 sec cast, char is not bad at 4.5 secs and its effeceincy gets better. Other than that they are not as good as wizards but they should not be, when you add the pets damage stream to our nukes we do good. Only time it sucks is in a hard hard solo fight against a fire resist mob, the lvl 44 is slooow but still gets it done.<BR>3. We have pets for defense, I hope you use the pet health command, use it, keep an eye on your pet, in your mind plot the curve of your pets health, when that line hits zero in approx 10 secs and the fight curve (life of the mobs curve) is greater than 10 secs eaither gate, nuke like mad, or chain a pet.<BR>4. Lucked out with water pet, got it for 2k, normal price on my server is 10k These should be going down over time as more of the hi lvl mages get there spells (is my hope) the other pets where alot cheaper, got air for 1k, fire for well I think free  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Now your last point about over powered, you will no ever solo a mob with 100k hp nor will you even do it in a group of 6 unless it is reall low lvl. These mobs are meant to be hard (and I have yet to kill one :-) Now you seem to think we are weak<BR>against these? Why, alot of spell casting classes<BR>go oom durring these fights, and can then only<BR>nuke at the rate of mana regen, we can nuke at this rate PLUS we have a pet who is hitting constantly. Water on the butt of a monster did according to my logs approx 5k a minute. Now these data came from lower lvl mobs than the 100k ones I would say but still when a wiz goes OOM a mage is still fighitng away so be happy. Alot of guilds love mages, we have pets with amazing FR,<BR>PR and good meelee ability.<P>I would argue strongly that we need NO increase in power at all. None what so ever. I would be upset if they increased the power of mages when so many other classes are weaker. As I said before this is not vs the mobs but compared to other classes fighting the same mobs. Please try playing a few other classes then you will see how powerful you are.<P>Arios lvl 54 mage<BR>Saro  lvl 50 ranger<BR>Artel lvl 35 bard<BR>Sleat lvl 30 rogue</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Mages are not underpowered at all I just dinged to 59 yesterday and am going for 60 in two days hopefully. They have no defenses but there pets are virtually indestructable if you think about it. Yourself and the ausom pet are two very powerful things. You think about hmm... <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"> Lets see mages have ausom spells that basically take out anything in it's way. And the pet gets it non stop and if you kill two mobs the pet gets like somewhere areound 4500 hp on the guys litteratly so all in all you have to think who is the better fighter and caster.

</FONT><HR> Have a hard time reading your post. Your saying that between lvl 52,55,56,58. We should have to retain our lower lvl pet's.That our Epic Quest is just fine the way it is.That the only relatively good spell's we have are COH,Muzzle&lt;if you can find it&gt;, Debuffing line, and DD spell's which you have to keep the same one for a lot of lv's.<P>        Of greatest concearn is Fire pet is a joke post 50, Burnout 4 is way underpowered.Epic Quest is fairly impossible for majority of mages./assist giving wrong target's making mages and other pet classes not wanted for gropup's.Drop rates for some mage spell's are insanely low IE 54 water pet , Muzzle,and COH come to mind fast.Post 50 if you dont have a lot of friend's and a guild.Things are pretty bleak for you.The ride to 50 mages shine after thatis all down hill.<BR>    Arcer 55 Conjurer    Liner 53 Vicar<BR>          WWW.MysticalFate.com<BR>    Mystical Fate Teris-Thule<BR>    Back to this guy's thread.

</FONT><HR><P>The way I got around the problem of finding a group was to start my own guild.  It will mean soloing a lot to get out of level 54 and into 55 and it will also mean training folks at much lower levels for many months.  Eventually I will have a group.  Sometimes you just have to take the long way to get what you want.<P>The problem with mages getting groups is a real one.  Some of us play female characters (I do not<BR>since I am male in rl), if you play a female mage you will get groups a bit more.<P>If you have a lot of time to play and make friends you will get groups a bit more.<P>If you don't have a lot of time, play a male mage, and are not of the age range of most players on when you are do not count on feeling like you fit in or finding a group as much as other players.<P>I remember bing denied groups back in HK when I was level 27 because a 27 cleric or melee was around.<P>I love playing a mage.  My advice to others that simply can't find a group is not to park the mage if you love it.  You can:  Start a guild that is mage friendly (I did) and build teams for the future as you level your mage solo, Look for a caster friendly guild.. one where mages are invited to exp groups and raids, solo good loot drops (if your of high level) and trade the loot for spots on raids and garentees at a chance with loot you need for quests or to wear.<P>Just my advice..<P><BR>Rthen Majere<BR>Level 54 Elementalist (forever it seems.. you were right Saro!!)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000458-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000458.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000458&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000458&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
