</FONT><HR>The arguments presented against ebaying thus far simply do not hold water. If you have just died in the Emerald Jungle and a 60th level Cleric offers to rez you, do you first ask "Are you ebay?". No, you dont, because that would be stupid. The concept that an alternate "controller", if you will, somehow nullifies the validity of a character that has existed on a server for months if not years is nonsense. If I decide to let my brother, mother, son, or even my dog play my character what business is that of yours and what harm to your gaming experience? Extend that out to a person i decide to sell my character to and the same reasoning applies. If that person is inexperienced, and you can tell, or his play is less than perfect, then dont group with him/her. Other than that, they cannot harm you. So, what's your argument? Its cheating? How so? Is Everquest a grand competition between you and the others online? ...or is it a Roleplaying game? It is a roleplaying game and the characters in the game, reguardless of who is controlling them, have earned what they have. Your jealousy over some stranger you dont even know haveing a character higher level than yours, or better stuff than yours is childish. The game is about role-playing and having fun, not "I've played this game since beta, therefor I am better than you". <BR>90 percent of all ebayers that I have met in-game are good people who have real lives and would not EVER get to experience a huge part of the game they paid for becuse they simply do not have the free time it takes to get to high levels in this game. So how is their "moving up in the game by other means" an encrochment on your game? The ONLY reason it could possibly be is in YOUR mind. Because there is nothing any character can do in game to directly affect another ( at least not in the context of someone besides the original creator of the character playing that character). If they could, people would already be doing it (ebay or no ebay) and you know it. <P>The last time I checked this was a free country. Who the hell are you to tell me that my $500 and 600 hours of time have to be "deleted"? If I choose to pass on my account to my son, give it to a friend, or sell it on ebay, that is my decision. Any and all complaints about this sort of practice are based soley in the overly competative, under matured minds of people with too much time on their hands and no real life to spend it on. They get their "power trips" by putting down total strangers who have just as much right to be enjoying the game (in their own way) as they do. When what they should be doing is welcoming the "new owners", helping them with their characters, and making new friends. That's more important dont you think? Who knows, you may find that they are really good people and, with a little time, good players. They may even wind up rezing you when you get jumped by five gorillas while traveling through Emerald Jungle. <P>As for Verant's stance on this issue, I cant use the kind of words here that i would like to.  Verant made Everquest what it is.  Their lack of vision in this area does not give them the right to tell me what or what not to do with my investment (money and time).  They have every right to control peoples actions in-game for the sake of maintaining a playable and, hopefully, an enjoyable game.  BUT, out of game, my life, my money, my time, and my actions are mine to police and NO ONE elses.  Just becuase a company made the model airplane kit that you built as an enjoyable hobby, that does not give them the right to prevent you from giving away, or selling that airplane when its finished.  Reguardless of the fact that others cherrish their little model airplanes and consider the "casual model builder" to be less than a "real model builder".<P><BR>Bottom line is...Play your own game, dont tell me how to play mine.<P><BR>Yberra<BR>(No, Im not an ebay account. Nor have i sold one. BUT, if i so choose, then I shall.)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>and banned you will be.<P>The main argument, and the problem I mainly have is people selling ITEMS through e-bay.  Those items are 99% of the time farmed over and over by the same people to make a profit.  That makes it harder for me to get said item becuase someone else is camping it to make a profit.  <BR>AAH then comes in the issue of making money of of VI's product.  You wouldnt go on the web and copy someones source code from their webpage and try to sell that would you?  Even if you are selling the TIME (aah the key word of e-bayers) it took to do so?  NO, and why you ask?  Becuase its someone elses property that you would be selling.<BR>It states this all of this in the EULA.  There should be no argument, its like signing a contract every single time you click  that I agree, button.  If you took them to court, you would lose, simple as that.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Mr. Bigstuff, that's who.<P>But seriously folks, I don't really mind ebayed characters.  I ususally run through some tests when grouping with someone I suspect of being ebayed, such as striking up conversations about old events ("how about the halloween event in kithicor eh?").  <P>If they turn out to be deadly, I loot my corpse and move on, after trying to con them out of some of that phat lewt of course.  ("That jade mace is outdated, you need this Ebon Razor for the added resists. Resists are everything in this game!")<P>The thing that bothers me is the item farming.  And one of the scariest ideas I have seen put forth is supported in-game real-world transactions.  EVERYONE would want cash for their items, and when I say everyone I of course mean everyone that would want cash, not everyone in general, but that isn't the point.  I am sure no smart company would allow this kind of thing, because it would ruin the in game economy.  Which would you rather have for those Golden Efreeti Boots?  8,000 platinum, or 200 bucks in cold hard cash for 5 hours of mostly afk camping?<P>The bottom line is that it is against the EULA and furthermore the law to sell things you don't own.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>There's too main problems associated with ebay.<P>1. An ebayed player is less likely to know what his/her character is capable of if they haven't learned the finer points of their class over the levels. Note I did not say they don't know how to play their class. But I would much rather have THE player who got the cleric to lv 60, not someone who bought it and said "Hmmm I think I'll go on a raid with my new character"<P>example: Lv 24 hunting in LOIO. We had a druid (just an example please dont flame me druids) in our group. I noticed the entire time we fought, she medded. She never got up the entire time we camped. I asked if she was ok, and she said nothing, but periodically she would get up and cast the same buff on herself. Ths got me to thinking. Later she asked what Spirit of the Wolf was. I asked if she was new and playing someone's character for fun, she said no, just that she hadn't played in a while. I said fine but kept an eye on her. We pulled a pretty nasty pull, she got up, cast SOW on herself and ran. 1 minute later as we were on CR she was camped. <P>I didn't want to be mad, but I kept thinking "She was ebayed, how could a lv 23 druid not know what SOW was?" and this and that. She could have saved my group if she had healed and DS'd but she was new and didn't know anything about her class. <P>Ebayed characters CAN kill a group. Thats why if you left I wouldn't want someone who didn't know your character to play it. They don't know all the little details, and they could cost me some serious downtime.<P>Its also a matter of respect. DO you seriously want your character that you put so much time and effort into, to just be handed over to someone who probably can't appreciate it? No other player will ever play my bard. I've built a good reputation of at least being a good bard (If not a bit of a weirdo and a-hole  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">), I won't let someone ruin something I worked hard to build up.<P>2. Ebaying items causes pharming. Plain and simple. Every person that cannot sell his FBSS on ebay is either going to sell it for plat, or give up camping it. This opens up an avenue for someone else to get it. Name one server where no one has sat and camped an item for the sole purpose of selling an item and I will show you a server with a great economy. By eliminating the plat aspect of the item, you hurt the economy by introducing another currency, "dollars". <P>3. Its against the agreement you click on everytime you enter the game. By agreeing to something you say you are going to follow it. And by not following it you are lying. Are you a liar? I bet if I called you one to your face you would freak out and yell, but what you are doing is breaking a contract and in plainest form, lying.<P>4. &lt;&lt;&lt;The game is about role-playing and having fun&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>How do you RP Ebay? By introducing ebay you are ignoring that this is some immersive world, and saying it is in fact just a bunch of pixels designed for you to manipulate to make money. Using RP to make your case about ebaying eliminated the last of the credibility you had.<P>Styrbjorn Dangerhorn<BR>Lv 31 bard of Prexus<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A quick follow up...<P>The only real response i've seen thus far is the farming issue.  However, I am far from new to this game and play on one of the oldest and biggest servers.  To date, I have yet to see ANY evidence of "farming" of items in game by anyone other than guilds (my own guild included).  But, even in those cases, it is primarily a byproduct of game design (read all the post concerning the "comping" requirement in game) and how to acquire items or help your guildmate aquire them. Yes, i have seen the items for sale on ebay.  However, if someone whishes to spend their "cold hard cash" on something like vertual golden efreeti boots, then who are you (or me for that matter) to tell them they should not or cannot??<P>Yberra<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&lt;&lt;&lt;So, what's your argument? Its cheating? How so? Is Everquest a grand competition between you and the others online? ...or is it a Roleplaying game? It is a roleplaying game and the characters in the game, reguardless of who is controlling them, have earned what they have. &gt;&gt;&gt;<P>When you said that, you're argument went straight into the toilet.  EQ is NOT a roleplaying game unless it is by choice.  The design of the game is item-centric and building power through the levelling of your character.  And that's it.  That is what EQ fundamentally is.  In a perfect world, everyone would roleplay, everyone would have fun.  But it is not a perfect world.  There is a percentage of the player base out there who play this game only for profit and that is a PROVEN FACT.  They have ruined thousands of players fun in their quest to get the ultimate item to make RL money on,  That is why ebaying should be wrong.  <P>If you someone wants to enjoy the high level game or the riches that EQ has to offer at the upper levels, then go out and earn it like the majority of the players out there.  We have sat through long camps, put up with a lot of Verant BS, had to deal with some of the most incredible a-s-s-holes that are walking the planet, just to get to that level.  And you know what?  It pisses me off that someone has the opportunity to get to where I'm at without having to earn it.  Is it jealousy?  No it's not.  It's about work ethic and putting the amount of time that it takes to get there.  E-bayed characters are dangerous at higher levels in a lot of dungeon, and uber, multi-group raids.  All it takes is one idiot doing the wrong thing to get everyone killed and god forbid we have an unrecoverable corpse due to someone's lack of knowledge.  I could go on and on with this...and perhaps I will after I see some of the responses to this thread, but for now....<P>/rant off<BR>/steps off the soapbox   <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

We the players can rant and rationalize and rabble-rouse all we want, but we aren't the ones making e-baying illegal.  That would be Verant.  And THEY are doing it to protect themselves from people who might claim they sold or bought things online and didn't get the item or cash.

No, it isn't even legal.  The hammer doesn't own the item, he gained control over it at the whim of the auction commitee, and was rewarded for its sale in the way determined by the commitee.

</FONT><HR>Folks,<P>Thank you for your thoughtful replies.<P>First, I am well aware of Verant's stance on this issue.  There is no need to point out the obvious.  I work as Director of Information Technologies for my corporation as my "day job" and, as our corp has many companies, one of which is a Computer games developement company, which I have a personal stake in and is on the verge of releasing its first title, I assure you I completely sympathise with VI on their right to maintain control of their game.  Probably more so than the average person.  However, my argument (my problem you might say) centers around two points. 1) What I do after I click "Yes" to exit Everquest is my business reguardless of the EULA. and 2) The "ebayers get me killed" argument is just not a very good one.  If I decided to let my 8 year old son play my high level character and he doesn't do so with YOUR required expertise then, as one of the posters said, TOUGH! And the same goes for the ebayer as well.  Most person's who buy ebay accounts are already players with considerable game time.  They may have some catchup time in learning to play their new class but they will come around.  What is the problem here?  The examples given of "ebay players" dont make any sense at all.  It sounds more like little Johnny playing dady's character.  <P>As for the "Your comments are worthless because Verant makes the rules" responses, well, all I can say is you dont have very much experience in the real world.  I have seen nothing to lead me to believe that if Verant was seriously challenged on the right to pass your money and time investment on to someone else (ie, Ebay, to a friend, etc...)they would win in court. However, though I hold my time and money invested in EQ as valuable, I would never spend money on makeing that challenge.  It is just too trivial an item in RL to do so.  I believe that attitude is probably the most powerfull component of Verants stance on this issue.<P>Yberra</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

(they had to work for the money, so it is not true they got the item without efforts)... So seeing that shows to me that maybe the time required to aquire satisfactory items in EQ is not quite "balanced" yet.<P>Its like when I have to wait in line at the bank... I get pissed off cuz I cant get what I want when I want it but I am real and see that I have to go thru the system. If I see some guy cut in line, even if hes not cutting in my line... well that just plain sucks (BTW, no matter how you put it, it is jalousy... even if I wouldnt cut in line, I sure would like to get the satisfaction he got for not waiting).<P>While some ppl will blame the ppl who want to get what they want when they want it, I blame the damn line. If a line is so damn long that ppl can actualy sell their place.. well you will understand what you want... but bare in mind I have never saw a game where the word "suffering" was used so often by so many ppl when describing playability.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have a penchant for answering silly questions in Topic lines without actually reading the posts.  It's fun, especially when the instigator doesn't bother to make the topic line describe the real subject of the post.<P>Verant owns the game.  That's why they can make the rules on how we conduct ourselves in it, and what we do with the software/license outside of it.  You don't own the game.  You don't own your character.  You haven't invested time in it.<P>You've played a game that you've licensed access to for a period of time.  You don't own anything contained therein, so you can't sell anything contained therein.  If you don't own it, you can't sell it.  I look forward to the first of these cases to go to trial to demonstrate that eBay sales are fraudulent.<P>eBay and its clones hurt the game.  I don't think the competition issue holds water except on the Zeks, and there are already other issues that pale beside this one.  Someone can spend more time and get the equipment that'll off you, too, so it's a de minimus harm.  The damage is from pharming and camp hogging.  That's the harm that is done to the game and the players.  I wish Verant had done this long ago.  There really was no reason not to.  Almost makes one believe the paranoia contained in Tweety's latest rant.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, last post.<P>I wanna thank those of you who took the time to reply with intelligent arguments.  The posts about the "farming" problem have certainly lead me to think that I may be wrong on that issue.  Perhaps my gaming style simply doesnt put me in a position to see that sort of stuff happening in game.  My opinion, of course, wont amount to a hill of beans in either case as for as Verant is concerned, that was never the intention of this post.  I simply wanted to see what players thought were the biggest issues surrounding Ebay and like services as reguards to EQ, and why people were having such a problem with it.  As I hope you figured out from the arguments above, I am not so much pro-ebay as I am against a company like Verant (or any other company) selling me a product and then dictating like Nazis what I can and cant do with that product (yes yes, i understand all the parts about how im only paying for the "privalage" of useing their systems).  <P>As for the other replies...well, they pretty much speak for themselves. <P>For the record<BR>I do not believe Sony would ever allow a lawsuit to go to trial for two reasons.  1) I believe consumer protection laws would take presedent over the EULA if a clear conflict between the two could be shown. I, for one, think it probably could (however, I have not done any reasearch on this, so this is purely my opinion) 2)It wasn't so long ago that the tobacco companies were crucified for adding addictive substances to their products.

</FONT><HR>Here's a slightly different take on the problem.<P>Thanks to eBay, more of the "uberloot" items were being farmed to be sold out of game.  Same with plat, to a lesser degree.  Then, said items were being traded off to characters that had not, in any way, shape, or form, earned those items in game.  This has messed with the economy of the game world, causing a disruption to the intended pace/flow/feel of the game.<P>This kind of "entire world" disruption may not be all that much per person, but the overall effect could be massive.  Putting a stop to it is a needed step in controlling the game world's money problems.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OK as for the camping issue... I've got news for you... This is the Ebay "big business" plan from what I noticed surfing auctions...<P>Soandso makes an account. Gets a bunch of characters up in level, maybe a druid or a wizzie.. definitely to level 6, probably to level 24 or so for the self ports.  They then watch EBay... buy say a pair of Yak's for $50, turn around go in the game and sell them for 2500PP each... they then turn around and sell the 5Kpp on Ebay for $100.  They didn't farm anything, they just did a little song and dance turning gold into lead worth more gold so to speak, acting as a kind of warehouse.  Those people who have 200+ feedback and auctions on 5 servers at once?  Yep, that's what they were doing.  They grabbed a bargain from someone who XP camped Guk for a few days, won a coupla rolls, and decided to fund their next semester. The REAL farming problem is this.. servers were designed for 1000 people with 10% being high enough to hit Guk and SolB.  Servers now have 2000 people with 75% being able to hit solB and Guk  The DROP SCHEDULE is what causes farming.  If you want to elminate farming we need the FBSS, and SMR to drop more often, and identical in all but name and appearance items like the  Billowing Red Sash, and the Dull Carbonite Robe to start dropping in other places.<P>It's ruining the economy!<P>Well here's the scoop on that.. and I mean pooper-scooper scoop.  That's crap.  There is a problem with the economy.  I just pointed it out up above.  In the real world a Dollar is worth a certain ammount of gold.  That fluctuates here and there, but mostly it's pretty fixed... which in turn gives other countries a baseline to fix their currency to. (Well this was the case when the whole thing started before money became too electronic to really apply to gold standard anymore.)  Now everything has a set value in the real world.  Now let's hop into EQ- Plat is worth items that are worth plat.  The problem is, there's no VALUE beyond a plat is worth more than a gold is worth more than a silver is worth more than a copper that isn't worth anything.  I can remember when you couldn't buy anything with plat... I can also remember when you could ONLY buy things with plat (No Trades please!) (trades only!)  Its because of the poor coding of the vendors.  As long as the Vendors pay 25PP for that SSOY, noone's gonna sell it to a vendor, but more and more the price is going to start getting closer to 25PP.  OK the price thing I see as the same problem above.  The overwhelming success of Everquest caused the drop schedule issue.  Noone expected server populations to look like this.  Well they do, its time to adjust for them.  Noone probably expected a SSOY to sell for 2000 plat.  Well they do.  They want a player driven economy, but they didn't give us any striped lines on the road to tell us what lane we're in... well they did, but that's on a country back road, and we're on a 12 lane highway baby!  It's time to adjust the vendor pricing on ALL middle to high end loot, and it's time to adjust drop schedules, and add identical, yet customized items, so that a warrior doesn't HAVE to wear a FBSS, he can wear a BRSS instead.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
