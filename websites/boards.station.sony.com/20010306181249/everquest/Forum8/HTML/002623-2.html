</FONT><HR>Lol, this is amazing.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Lirolar makes an interesting observation that, if correct, is extremely helpful to all players.  He hypothesizes that the reason for his observation has to do with the inherent ugliness in uneven division.<P>Suddenly, rather than saying wow, “that’s a neat idea, I’ll try it out, thanks”, everyone jumps down his neck about the irrelevant nits of the math.  You’re all geeks!  I’m an a veteran computer programmer (confirmed geek).  C, C++, Java, perl, assembly (ouch), etc, whatever is to hand, I’ve done it. <P>The nature of floating point and it’s use is apparently misunderstood.  The minute I say 1/3 I have a value problem and depending on whether I try to worry it out, or just put it in a leftover bucket, I’m still faced with a problem that must me handled much differently than 6/3.  Regardless of whether the solution involves integer or floating point, the problem still must be dealt with.<P>And still I say, the math is a red herring chased by geeks.  The real post is about an interesting observation.  Thank you Lirolar, I will keep your advice in mind.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>Read this whole post.  Decided I would try it out and see what happens.  Did it make a difference?  Not entirely sure.  I have succeeded on more smithing attempts than I have failed recently.  This could just be it was my turn to succeed, and regarless of the numbers I was going to make the pieces I tried.<P>However, it is an entertaining enough theory, that  the exchange of 3 str for 3 wis to make both even numbers is minor in my opinion.<P>I have gotten 2 skill increases recently, which was also a nice little bonus.  (differnt days, they were not repeat successes which I love and hate).<P>Something I keep and mind and do, just in case.  At this point, i am willing to do anything to increase success rates.  This includes the silly things like ALWAYS putting Sheets top to bottom, hammer in top right slot, mold below it, then padding and lastly water.  Stupid?  Yep.  make a difference?  Nope.

</FONT><HR>Good point baavgai.  If the phenomenon is true, it is very useful.  But what I saw was not a simple presentation of an observation. It was backed up with an argument and credientials that invited a harsh debunking.  Then after it was established that inaccuracies backed up credentials wouldn’t fly in this thread, comblast-aotg, decided to temp fate.  He is apparently the kind of guy who would Hail Kizdean Gix at 10th level <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>But notice that I didn’t just debunk it—I offered a glimmer of hope from hashing where prime numbers do have a significant impact on distribution of output.  But more importantly, I asked for real testable data.  I even suggested a coin flipping part to block against temporal bias.<P>I hope that a lot of younger people considering a career in computer science are finding this thread useful.  And despite baavgai’s disdain for geeks who ‘scowl at you ready to attack’ aggroing everything, I hope that this thread is more illuminating because of the way it developed.  There are lessons in software, logic, politics, and judgment, among others.  <P>Tonight I will show you what I intend to do with the data.  If any statisticians want to jump in, feel free. My statistics is rusty, so realize that I may have some errors in what follows.  But I don’t think my reasoning is fundamentally faulty.<P>I am assuming that trade skills follow a binomial distribution with a probability of success that depends on the trade skill level, wis/int/str and the difficulty of the Combine attempt.  This is called the “null hypothesis”.  It is what we have to disprove for Lirolar’s hypothesis to be accepted.  So, what I want to know is this: if I run a test and get some data, what is the probability that I would get results at least as good, if the null hypothesis were true.  That probability is called the “significance level.”  Often 5% is considered a reasonable significance level.  That is, if I would need to redo the test 20 times to get results that better match the null hypothesis, then the null hypothesis is brought into question.<P>If that made sense, I will go a step further.  Let’s say the probability of success on even wis/int/str is Pe and the probability of success on odd wis.int/str is Po.  Now say the difference, Pd, is Pe-Po.  Now say that my new hypothesis (H1) is that Pd = x  where x is 0% or 5% or –5% or anything else.  My new question becomes, for what range of x, is H1 significant.  We can make a “confidence interval” that is 95% likely to contain the true value of Pd.  The more data, the tighter the interval.  So here is a purely made up exercise:<P>Let’s say I make Heady Kiolas (HK) with wis of 100 and a wis of 101 and that I am trivial in HK.  I get 48HK of 50HK at wis=100 and 42HK of 50HK at wis = 101.  (These are made up.)  What range of x is 95% likely to contain the true Pd?  The mean successes were 0.96 and 0.84.  Their standard deviations are (for binomial sqrt(N* (P-1)*P) where N is the number off attempts and P is probability of success) 0.1960 and 0.3666 or 1.3856HK and 2.5923HK.  If I subtract the distributions, I get difference in means of 6HK per 50 attempts with a standard deviation of 2.9394HK (s.d. = sqrt(variance) and when adding/subtracting distributions, variances add.)<P>Now, assuming that the binomial distribution can be represented as a normal distribution, and plugging into Excel with the NORMINV function with probabilities of 0.025 and 0.975 (95%), mean of 6, s.d. of 2.9394, I get in 95% confidence interval of 0.24HK to 11.76HK for each 50HK because of the difference in wis.  Since 0HK lies outside this range, these data would be not be inconsistent with a claim that there is a difference between even and odd wisdom.<P>Notice that there are several places where there are potential problems.  This is why it is easy to lie with statistics.  I could make the claim that the difference in wisdom is the important factor rather than the fact that is even or odd.  More tests would be needed.  I could claim that one run of HKs was done one day and the other another day, and that is the important factor.  More tests would be needed.  I could claim that since 50 were done in East Freeport and the other 50 were done in East Freeport, that is the difference.  I could claim that the results were selectively tested only after the tester saw that they might support the hypothesis—sort of like flipping a coin and testing if it loaded after a streak of Heads and then using that streak to show that the coin is unfair.  <P>Tests are done.  Thus EQ science marches on.<P>My point is not to dazzle people into believing something.  It is to show how you might support Lirolar’s hypothesis.  You need math to turn anecdotal evidence into empirical evidence.  And you need to account for other forms of bias over time.<P>Again. I renew my call for data.  I hope this post is constructive in the eyes of baavgai.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>    I seriously doubt that anyone at Verant is even remotely adept in this field of mathematics (considering that a good portion of professional coders never even finish college). This is called trying to find the complex in the simple. I assure you they used nothing short of a standard licensed lib, and did not build the code from the ground up. So the argument over what seeds the generator can be solved with research, not deduction. Find the legal information for which compiler they used, and you have the answer to that particular dilemma. What they did with this formula in code, I leave that for your tests and your tower of babel.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>KrenkFeen, I don't think they are using a homebrew RNG.  But they did write the function that takes a random number, wis, int, str, item information, and your skill as inputs and gives a success or failure as an output.  The random number is simply an input into this.  I want to probe that function, not the RNG.<P>And the way I propose doing that *is* research. The research is empiricial rather than phenomenological, but so are most new branches of science. So is the entire pharmaceutical industry. All I'm proposing is that we put some numbers on our superstition/intuition.  It's one thing to say, "I changed my wis from even to odd and I seemed to get better results."  It's another to say, "Based on my test results, I am 95% likely to make somewhere between -8.3 and 18.5 more Heady Kiolas per 100 than when my wisdom is odd."  The first is superstition/intuition, the second is a demonstration that the test in inconclusive (made up number BTW.)<P>You may call it "Trying to find the complex in the simple," but I call it "trying to find the simple in the random" (or "trying to find the signal in the noise") which is the only way it can be done short of breaking into Verant's offices and stealing the source code.<P>This is how science is done.  As far as it being a Tower of Babel, OK I admit it. If you don't have the interest in following what I've laid out, you're probably not going to try to follow it.  But I am hoping that there are a few people out there who appreciate learning something about using statistics to test a hypothesis.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I just caught this thread, and I'm not sure what I think of the issue as a whole, but I thought I'd makes things a little more fun for you guys by throwing in this tidbit:<P>http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/devprods/vs6/visualc/vccore/_crt_floating.2d.point_support.htm<P>This page lists the functions in the standard C runtime that require a math coprocessor (i.e. floating point unit), or equivalent software emulation. Guess what?  "int rand(void)" is on it. I have no idea whatsoever how they would use floating point math to generate a random integer, but there you have it.<P>Technically this only applies to Visual C++, but I can't imagine why MS's implementation would be that different from anyone else's. MS's C and C++ implementation is about as obsessively standards-compliant as they come, and their documentation is impeccable.<P>Actually, the more I look at this list, the weirder it seems. "int abs(int)" uses floating point math? What's up with that?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hmmm...  Interesting, Kaphka.<P>I did a little digging here.  It looks like I am partially wrong, but basically right.  <P>First, I went to Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\vc98\crt\src\rand.c.  The VC++6.0 algorithm is there.  I won't reveal it because I'm not sure if my EULA allows me to divulge Microsoft's source code.  But there isn't a 'float' or 'double' to be found.  Nor a division. Hmm… Why would it depend on the FPU?<P>So next I went to the Intel website and downloaded a couple of Intel Pentium Architecture manuals from http://developer.intel.com/design/pentiumii/manuals/243190.htm and 243191.htm.<P>I guessed that the reason for the use of the FPU was just more bits than the standard IMUL and MUL.  So I found the description of FIMUL.  It states that the FIMUL converts the integer to an extended real which is an 80 bit floating point number.<P>So, it is converted to floating point!  It’s sort of a trivial floating point because the integer fits into the mantissa of the extended real.  My guess is that since they have the big multiplier for the FPU anyway, they just make use of the already existing hardware and package the integer as an extended real.  Becoming a floating point number is just the price of admission to the big multiplier.  A sort of fake ID to get into the transistor party.<P>So why use FIMUL instead of MUL? Is it faster?  I guess OutlawPhantom is right. I can only speculate. But in the end, the particular implementation and Intel’s hardware design techniques do not change the fact that the RNG algorithm is most likely an integer based algorithm with no FP rounding problems.  Note that the conversion to FP is hardware specific.  Other processors may not do that.<P>Excellent find Kaphka!  You had me sweating for a while.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, as to the random number generation, Borland Turbo Pascal for one ONLY used floating point.  A real number us created between 0 and 1, then scaled to fit any additional range paramenters the function is givin (ex. random(50, 100) returns about 0.500000 internaly, that is scaled to the 50 range between the numbers and shifted up the 50 for a end result of 75.  And, if I am not mistaken, isn't the random number function unique to the compiler?<P>I am willing to help out a bit here.  I need a large number of steel boning, as I am a tailor.  Steel boning is trivial (no higher) for me, and I can easily vary my int (I am a caster, and can get int without too much hassle, standard gear is 204).  I will keep all stats but int constant if possible.  Trying primarily 200, 201, 202, and 203 int if I can without changing any stat (from the str, dex, cha, wis, int list).  In fact, I will go buy a 2str ring for this very purpose, to keep str constant as I switch gear.  I don't have a lot of money, and can only afford to dump a few hundred plat into this, but I will get back to you in a few days.  Skill will be constant, as I don't advance smithing, it is trivial, and I only make tailoring supplies. Also, I will do it all in N Freeport in a single sitting.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Can't help but throw in my 2 cents.  I can't claim specific expertise in psuedo random number generators, but I have studied some of them.  They were all integer based.  What is interesting is if you give some psuedo random number generators even numbered seed values, they can have very short cycles.  Instead of cycling through 32k different integer values, they might only give a few dozen and start over.<P>However, I find it hard to accept that one character's stats are used to define the seed or the random number generator itself.  <P>Think like a programmer for a second.  You have the tasks of defining the probability for success, and providing a random number to check against it.  You have do to this for both success on creating the item, and for skill increase if the item isn't trivial.  The success formulas would likely be a function of your skill, your stats, and the trivial level of the item. The random number generator is already available in the language/compiler provided for you, so you use that.  Why would you go through the extra effort of customizing the generator with character stat values that are already factored into the success formulas?<P>There is also the question as to whether there is a single server wide psuedo random number generator, or lots of independent generators created by zone, or by character.  Is it a psuedo random number generator software routine, or a look up table?  <P>There is also the possibility of other factors.  For all I know, Verant could have added a global variable to the success/failure rates to control how fast all jewelers get skill increases.  By lowering the learning rate, Verant increases the cost in platinum, and creates a money sink for the economy.  What kind of distribution curve is in use?  Is there a time based variable for success?  You will succeed more making Teir'dal adamantine at night?<P>I've gotten phenomenally lucky strings of successful combinations (85 successful Blood of Wolf potions in a row when I usually have one or two bad every 20), and I've failed in streaks too.<P>The only answer here is to do some controlled tests.  Make a new character, and then make some items.  Make another new character, give him some stat buff items, and then make some items.  Repeat as needed.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I would think that a good test for someone to try (so that skill increases are not a factor, and "ceiling effect" is avoided), would be someone that has, say a skill of 51 and sees how many toolboxes they can make, which is exactly trivial at that level I believe. As for the variance, use all evens as a baseline, and then go for a HIGHER, but odd score (prime if possible), with ONE stat at a time, and do the same number. Make it higher but odd so you can't claim it's the pure stat number only. Try for 50 each and report it here!

While this was a small sample (i'de like to see numbers over 100 attempts with each WIS) the consistancy of successes was remarkable considering the difficulty of the item. No failure generated skill points either.<P>My gut feeling from this small sample, is that at least with fletching DEX is the primary skill check, not WIS or INT. Varying DEX may have made a greater statistical change.<P>So, I think what needs to be done is get a larger sample size, using a trade skill with only the greater of WIS/INT varied. STR/DEX modifiers possibly skew the results too much (esp vs the ration of success and skill point). Doing this on trivial items would also help (so the effect of skill increases on future success is minimised.) Idealy this would also need to be tested in laggy vs non-laggy zones.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Excellent, Discordia.  Your name doesn't fit your presentation <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  It appears that the even numbered attempt did have a slightly higher success rate.  But is it significant?  Just looking at the results, I can guess the answer is no.  But, let’s do the analysis and put some numbers on it.  (I’m not sure if the tabs are going to line up right, but here goes)<P>Trials	Attempts	Success	p	q	npq	s.d.<BR>1	28	25	0.892857	0.107143	2.678571	1.636634<BR>2	28	24	0.857143	0.142857	3.428571	1.85164<BR>1-2	56	1	0.017857		6.107143	2.471263<P>p = Success/Attempts<BR>q=1-p<BR>npq = attempts * p * q<BR>s.d = sqrt(npq)<P>The ‘1-2’ trial adds the attempts, subtracts the Success, adds ‘npq’ and takes the square root of npq for the standard deviation.  Now, assuming the binomial distribution can be represented as a normal distribution, and using the Excel NORMINV function, I get a 90% confidence interval of –3.06 to +5.06 (NORMINV(0.05,1,2.471263) to NORMINV(0.95,1,2.471263)).  That means that the actual number of increased successes per 28 attempts is 90% likely to lie between –3.06 and +5.06.<P>Since 0 lies within the confidence interval, it is safe to say that the test does not disprove the null hypothesis that there is no effect on even/odd.<P>Lets look at the skill point increases for kicks.  Assuming that you can increase on a failure even though it wasn’t observed, we get:<P>Trials	Attempts	Success	p	q	npq	s.d.<BR>1	28	3	0.107143	0.892857	2.678571	1.636634<BR>2	28	1	0.035714	0.964286	0.964286	0.981981<BR>1-2	56	2	0.035714		3.642857	1.908627<P>I get a 90% confidence interval of –1.14 to +5.14 increased skill points per 28 attempts with the stats mentioned in Discordia’s post.  Again, 0 lies in the confidence interval, so it is safe to say that these data do not support the hypothesis that even differs from odd.<P>It would be interesting to know how many samples would need to be done to notice a significant difference in combine success if the even/odd effect showed 1 in 28.  For a 90% confidence interval, the answer is about 463 at each wisdom.  For a 95% confidence interval it is 657 combines at each wisdom.  When the difference is larger, not so many are needed, so don't give up hope.<P>Since there are "lies, damned lies, and statistics," lets look at some of the questions we should have.<BR>1) The methodology was designed to eliminate streakiness.  Perhaps an even/odd effect has less to do with probability than with maintaining streaks of success.<BR>2) Could there be an effect from the skill increases themselves?<BR>3) Is a normal distribution a reasonable approximation for a binomial distribution?<P>As for the Einstein-God argument, there may be a real effect of believing in an even/odd effect if one doesn’t exist.  Some people may be leaving off significant items of jewelry because it makes their stats odd.  They may be having extra failures because they aren't wearing their jewelry.<P>DignDive, make anything that you need and can make in somewhat large numbers.  I’ve recently discovered the woman who sells infinite batwings by Inn3 in EC, so I might make a bunch of fish rolls.  They are relatively cheap to make and my success rate is a bit under 50%.<P>HoustonMark,<BR>Bringing the Enlightenment to a Middle Ages game <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just to review for those who haven't figured it out: if you lower your INT from 123 to 120 and then go from 118 to 130 in Jewelcraft in less than hour, you have demonsrated absolutely nothing concerning the even/odd hypothesis. You cannot make a statement like "this thing works!!" based on those results.<P>In order to say "this thing works!!" you have to show that you would have made fewer skill point increases and/or success at 123 than at 120. Sterma, you didn't even say what you were making, its trivial level and how many you tried to make in that hour.<P>HoustonMark,<BR>Keeping the rabble in line <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I did not count how many attempts, but it was about 400 plat worth of malachite/gold.  Previously when i did this i went up MAYBE 2 points and with the lowered INT on an even number I went from 115 to 129, so make you own judgements...<P>Keeping the rabble-keepers in line</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Better, Sterma, but still not really testable.  In order to demonstrate the even/odd hypothesis, you need to remove other effects.  If you do 400PP worth of combining at an even INT and get 2 increases and then 400PP at an odd INT and get 14 increases, you haven't eliminated at least one important source of bias.  Maybe you got more increases because you crossed some number where skill point increases come faster.  Maybe you would have gotten about 2 increases in to first 400PP at odd and about 14 in the second 400PP at even.  If you were to have switched back and forth between even and odd several times during 800PP of making malachite and gold, then you would have tested the hypothesis.<P>So, making my own judgements...the data is not quite sufficient to show anything despite the additional information you provided (400PP in Malachite and Gold).<P>HoustonMark,<BR>Skeptical Rabble-Keeper<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/002623-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/002623.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum8&number=8&thisthread=002623&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum8&number=8&thisthread=002623&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
