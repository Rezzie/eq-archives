</FONT><HR>I don't know if this is a "solution" to the sole called EQ-Addiction (which is the same for every single thing in the world... you can get "addicted" to anything), but just play all you want.  If it starts getting in the way of your real life, as in your friends, family, school work, work, etc., you do not have to "quit cold turkey" (I find that funny hehe), but just put your real life BEFORE EQ!  Its not that hard... its the same with every videogame, drug, and chat channel out there.  Seriously, if you care more about your rusty battle axe than your wife, you need professional help.

Cancel your account and break your EQ cd and be done with it? <BR>Sure youll wanna play again but really now, how can you place a videogame higher than a husband that loves you, if you already havent divorced im pretty sure your hurting that mans feelings constantly. Really, you have to think that EQ is not worth it, talk to the people youve met there, np, heck, you can even keep playing but you gotta keep in mind that EQ is NOT worth a thing, it is a dot compared to your friends/husband/RL. Try to figure that out for yourself, and believe me, there are a lot more fun things in life than EQ or any VIDEOGAME.

</FONT><HR>Sir I have to say I am with you all teh way...<P>If you read any posts from me with in the past coupel months you will know I have been leveling like crazy. Before the Summer I realised ?I had had a problem with EQ and after reading these posts I know I do. I quit for around 3 months (basically for the summer while MY fiancee who lives 4500 miles was in town thank god). When she left I started back..... And like many here it has been down hill since. I think I too am ready to quit I might just give my account away and be done with it. No real eason in laying any longer for me. I mean when i play a game a set a goal of beating it... And out of every Game I have ever played none have ever been as hard as this one, but well I hate to say this but this game is no longer fun. This is my whole EQ exp so far. 1-24 totally lost learnign the game. (quit for 3 months because i was tired of dieing) coem back and all my friends that were only level 30 when I left were close to the 50s if not in there 50s. After realiseing this I started to learn alot about the game (I learned a great deal before I left but did not have a chance to test out anythign i learned) First thing i did was contacted my friends asked them if they had any extras they could loan. They gave me great items and i was well on my way. I started in Rathe at 24 went to 33 there. Went to Overthere at 33-44. at 44 I went to Dreadlands to 47 and then I have been on a raid every night since i made level 47. Some people could nto believe how fast I leveled. Some told me i want to be just like you when i get of that level. I am well liked and I understand how to play my warrior too well. I have over 56 days of play time now. I have wasted many hours of my life and I have put off too many things. I am currently taking a 3 week break from this game to be with my fiancee again. I am going to try this tiem and totally break the habit. I was (as of a coupel weeks ago) putting much of the Game over anythign else. I will not do it anymore I admit I have a problem. I will solve my problem go cold turkey and get a second job to make up for the time. I mean I would much rather be well liked in person than well liked in a Game... That might actually give me extra money in my pocket too lol. Although I have not had any too serious probalems I know that if i continue this Game I will. I think after reading abotu the guide i thought about it but after reading these posts and many others like this I am ready to get back into shape and do what is right for myself. May God Bless and take care...<P>Sududdar<BR>47th Season<BR>Tarew Marr (ROH)<P>PS: Last time i agev out all my stuff to newbies that I seen. One orge was happy with the full crafted I gave him lol and MY Langseax of Wolves.

</FONT><HR>  I think this is something that everyone needs to be aware of and get involved in.  There should be time for everything of importance in your life, job/work, family and relationships. EQ should only be part of that mix in terms of being entertainment or hobby.  Before EQ, how much time did you spend on both entertainment and hobbies for an entire week combined?  I'll wager its far less that what the average EQ addict spends in one day playing.  I know, I used to be super addicted myself playing anywhere from 12-18 hours per day sometimes.  In the process, I lost a good paying job and a few friendships.<P>This is also something Verant should consider addressing with how they are handling in-game issues.  EQ would require less time if they had a better system for binding and travel.  If camp-time for items was lowered people would suddenly free up 50% of the time spent on EQ. There are tons of other things that could reduce the amount of time one spends in game.  Hobbiest painter's don't like to see a picture half-finish.  EQer's probably feel the same way about the next level or item they want or need.<P>In order to get over the addiction you need to do one thing, QUIT playing completely for 2 weeks.  Take note of all the things you accomplished while not playing. Judge for yourself which is more worthwhile, the next level or having a good life outside the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Funny, I went to the webaddiction site and took the test and turned out to be an average surfer, but I know that's not true!<P>I was an EQ addict, played so much I only got 3 hours of sleep every nite, and I failed 6 out of 8 classes that year *gasp*.<P>I would say the best way is to find another game that is not addictive but more FUN.  Addictive doesn't mean it's fun, just to note.<P>I think the problem with some addictive online games like UO and EQ, is that it does not give you the total satisfication you want on the usual non-online games.  Online games does not have a goal, and you cannot "beat" an online game, so some people tends to not believe that and continues to find that "goal" of the game, and that's when they start the addiction.<P>Some off-line games had goals, the end, and many gamers find the satisfication of beating the game, when they see the ending.<P>In EQ or UO, everything's repetitive(sorry for the spelling).  In UO, you either kill or get killed, there's a little tiny bit of a joy and fun when you kill someone in UO, but it does not satisfy the gamer, so they want more, they want to kill more players until they're killed.<P>In EQ, there's a false goal people believe in, it's level, level, and level.  It's true that in order to do more in EQ, you will have to level so you are strong enough to do the thing you always wanted to do (plane raid, running around in crushbone, etc..), but that is not totally true.<P>Sorry for the long post, that's my 2 cents</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>In UO I spent a lot more time talking to people in my or their houses, it was fun. We were training our skills a bit (pre antimacro patch) and talking about sports, food, etc..<BR>UO was way more addictive than EQ, EQ is mindless leveling most of the time, and sure you can go have fun fun fun, but thats very limited in a level based RPG, ie your friend levels a bit when you cant play for a while, you have to level to keep up because otherwise you cant come in the same places, etc<P>In UO you could bash about everything easily (exception: Hythloth if your not a mage) and we had a ton of fun going to deceit and get chased by a bunch of braindead PKs (never got me, they were so stupid, I dont know why everyone was nagging about the PKs heheh).<BR>What made me stop UO? Renaisance hehe, it totally trashed the game (total economy imbalance, farmed dungeons,..), im telling you, the PKs in UO were a necesity and they made the game a whole lot more exiting, I never had such a rush from a game when I was being chased by a member of the DJs LoL!! <P>Hehe, sorry, just had to say that.

</FONT><HR>I really dont want to seem rude or like I am in "denial" (lol), but I love EverQuest, and am not an addict.  I play on average 1-2 hours a day if I even get the time, and on weekends or free-days/break I play up to 2-3 hours a day if I'm not doing something with friends/family, or up to 5 hours if I go on a guild event (ie: raids, planes, exploring, helping newbies).  So please don't assume or influence (though everyone is entitled to their own opinion) others that every single EQ player is an addict and spends their whole life on the computer, and assume that the only way to not be addicted is to quit.  Real life over EQ... its only a game  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>PS-  Capcom VS SNK is more fun than EverQuest, I'll give you that &gt; <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/031570-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/031570.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/031570-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=031570&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=031570&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
