</FONT><HR>Things need to go back to almost as good as that first day.  No one gave two sh*ts about the loot anymore because things were dropping left and right and everyone knew that soon enough they'd get theirs.  A WIZARD OFFERED ME THE 11/30 PIERCER IF HE GOT IT BECAUSE HE WOULD EVENTUALLY GET ONE LATER HE COULD TRADE!!!  I instantly said amen this is the place for me!  Tree Weave tunics dropping all over - great AC for the classes who couldn't wear the BE BP and it brings a nice strength bonus making the weight in effect only 2.5 instead of the 12.5.  The gem encrusted ring, bard weapons, warrior weapons, SK weapons, rogue weapon (hehe).  Everything was dropping wonderfully and it was at this point that almost everyone on Tarew Marr said at that finally they have a place where no one has to fight over loot.  Pak'Cafan worked TOGETHER with Enlightened Dark one night.  Our official standing toward ED has always been neutral.  However my guild has several members in it who have been screwed over by some off the looting things with ED.  Pak and ED managed to break through the CoM and through that door on that night.  And by God....they had fun doing it!  <P>Exploration factor scored RoK a 10.<BR>No more worries about loot scored RoK a 10.<BR>People working together finally scored RoK a 10 and boosted the entire game to a 15.  A MMORPG is just that - MASSIVE MULTIPLAYER.  It requires people in harmony for it to be fun.  <P>This can clearly be seen on a planes break where people are running around like lunatics not listening to orders and doing their own thing.  When it is harmonius and everyone works together you clear it nice and easy and everything is good.  This is the problem.<P>If Verant is afraid they'll lose replayability they are dead wrong.  This is an online RPG where the world is always evolving and even though most people won't admit to it - the lot of us are addicted to this game.<P>Verant, I beg of thee.  Change the loot drops back to the way they were.  Allow people to be happy and have one less thing in their lives causing stress.  Allow for a situation where people will work together cause they don't have to compete over phat lewt.  Do this, and you make the game what it should have been from the world "Release."<P>If you support this idea - give a whole hearted bump along with a comment (let's show that we have brains and don't just like saying bump all over the place  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Wholehearted agreement and a BUMP......<P>It's pretty disheartening to see/hear that Verant has nerfed the drop rates in Kunark less than 2 weeks since it's release.<P>Bait and Switch?  I think so.<P>I'm having a hard time figuring out WHY the drop rates have to be such that it requires such long play periods to obtain anything worthwile.<P>Hearing the Uberguilders on this board whine that since they had to spends X amount of hours in the Planes to get their gear, and that it wasn't fair that others were getting good items, was beyond ridiculous.  It's Elitism, plain and simple.  It's also apparently something Verant completely endorses and promotes.<P>I, and I'm guessing many others, was thrilled to hear about the random drops and good loot that was reported the first couple days from Kunark.  Now, apparently, all has changed, and it's just more of the same old, same old.<P>Whereas it looked like EQ was taking a (huge) turn for the better, it now appears that things wil continue on as they always have.<P>If you can play all day every day, you'll get your stuff.<P>If not, well, sorry, you're SOL.<P>Nice one, Verant.<P>Who makes these decisions anyway?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>It seems most of these decisions are made by executives that have to ask what MMORPG stands for each time a decision about one crosses thier desks. These are the same guys that wonder what all the craze with fantasy and science fiction games is all about, and thier idea of doing something imaginative is putting thier left sock and shoe on before they put on the right one next time.<BR>Guys like that toss around phrases they think will sound good and hope thier customer base never realizes how little they really know about this thing they are in charge of.<BR>They go home to thier wife and 2.5 kids and tell them how great it was to make so many customers happy because they gave the order to cut something back that was too plentiful and therefore could not have been very good for that thingy they marketed a year ago that was going to make them rich enough to retire to a tropic island and not have to worry about what MMORPG really means.<BR>They are the anti-gamers, and you see them everywhere you see a suit and a tie with no imagination and a drawer full of black socks so they can look good when they have thier next board meeting and ask what MMORPG stands for.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Beating the creatures turn trivial when there is enough people to use in the combat so conquering the bests are not a factor that can limit the number of items released to the server PCs.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I am so glad that they did nerf the drops made kunark a whole lot better. I spent over 40+ fear and 40+ hate, 11 cazics, and 11 innys trying to get a weapon and never did. WHen kunark came to be i saw freaken twinks walking around with weapons that made god loot look pale, they did not to earn it just it dropped so much and so frequent. I know most of you newbes thing the game owes you good weapons, but it doesn't, you should have to earn it not get it handed to you. Stuff should a lot be changed to no drop too, too many freaken weapons that make (as i am a sk) the soul leach, beckon, and bloodmoon look like play toys. ALso with huge drop rates plac s like karnor were packed to the brim, with them nerfed the zone has lightedn out and less people in there now.<P>Now go earn your weapons and earn your weapons people, sorry that they aren't being handed to you like you wanted, call me selfish if you want, but after 10 months of trying to get a good weapon for myself, i get kinda offneded and mad when i see someones twink with there nice new polynomal axxe, or deathbringer rod.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I agree. Let the loot drop as before. As for those who say the planes are so much harder. They maybe are, but they ALWAYS had clerics for resuurections. The exp hit was minimal. A 90% res and 10 deaths equal 1 to most group in the new lands if no cleric around. So the risk is higher for non cleric group, and lets face it, the planes have CLERICS, most groups in the new lands do not. Let the good loot fall to give us a fighting chance...<BR>Calebe<BR>Level 42 Magician<BR>E`CI Server<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Seems to me that all those ebayers are upset that their profits are going down or their $300 purchase is now worth $5. There is no reason you should have to play for 12 hours straight to get a decent item. Quit complaining. Verant has already said they will be putting in uber items that will take an ungodly amount of effort to get.

</FONT><HR>Definetely worth a bump.<P>The first couple of days in Kunar's was awesome. I saw 3 high level guilds all working together to try and crack the place. No bickering, fighting, standard campcheck/list BS going around. There was enough drops to keep everyone happy. Some of us marveled at Verant for finally making the game group finally (as in multiple groups working together). The focus was on trying to crack the dungeon and and push on instead of arguing about what group gets to roll for what item and exactly what mob spawns each group is pulling, blah blah blah.<P>Unfortunately this was changed because people who can afford to spend 14 straight hours in front of their monitor felt slighted.   I went into Kunar's last night and one guild was in there and wasn't gonna share. Why??? Because they didn't want to lose out on the small amount of drops now.<P>I wish you stupid whiners would just quit like you threaten to do all the time.  I can't even go to the planes because I'm not in an "uberguild", Real life doesn't allow me to play every single night month after month. <P>It was nice to actually gain some plane type equipment for a change. Some of these idiots cry that they spent hours upon hours in the planes getting some equipment.

Random drops anywhere, and considering the sheer numbers of beasts and size of the zones this would mean anyone had a chance to get any old item. Not just someone who had the time to spend staring at a screen for hours on end.<P>I still think they have done a tremendous job in the new continent. We've got a pretty friendly server all in all, and just as the Planes of Greed arguments threatened to spill out amongst the general populace along came Kunark and gave everyone not only a breath of fresh air but a sense of freedom. <P>Our first few days there, 72 people in one zone, never saw a soul. Blimmin Marvelous.!!<P>And as for earning stuff, sheesh you think that spending most of your life glued to a computer screen playing a game is earning boy you are gonna suffer when it comes time for you to get a job and REALLY earn a living.<P>So good job Verant, lets hope you randomise the drops again and KILL Evercamp once and for all.<P>Cheers<P>Saroeb<BR>Naked Wizard<BR>Quellious<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I would just like to put in my thoughts on this.<P>I have only been playing since mid-February.  I have a level 17 paladin, and I am not a member of a so called uberguild.  I actually just joined a guild that only has about a dozen members, all under level 20.<P>I don't sell things on ebay, and I'm a casual gamer - maybe 8-12 hours per week.<P>So, with that being said, I'm glad they've turned down the drop rates on Kunark.  I don't understand how a game can be fun if everything is handed to you.  I'm looking forward to questing the armor of Ro and the soulfire someday.  A sense of accomplishment is a great thing!  I realize I may never be able to get a ghoulbane since I can't play for days straight, but I'm still planning to try!<P>I don't understand why everyone thinks it's "fun" to be able to easily get awesome weapons and armor that give +10 buffs to everything.  Once everyone has these items, they're worthless.  <P>I have a feeling that Verant turned up the loot rates in the early going in order to show people what is available, then turned them back down to what was actually intended all along.  Random drops are good, awesome equipment is good, just not so awesome that every level 5 player in the game is walking around with Fiery Avenger type weapons because rats are dropping them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Go crawl back under the rock you came from.  The mobs in question were ****ING TOUGH.  Just because a level 40 mob in a zone had a *chance* to drop something that you're more likely to find on a level 55, doesn't mean it's any easier.  You'll just have to kill more of them.<P>I'd rather listen to powergaming biatches like FoH whine about the drops - at least they know WTF they're talking about.  At least they had something to lose (even if temporarily) from the good drops.  You're just an idiot.  You're a Neville Chamberlain.

</FONT><HR><BR>I agree completely, the original drop rates caused everyone to actually start getting along, promoted generousity, relieved a lot of the stress, frustration, and disappointment, would have effectively put a stopper permanently into the eBay sales, and generally improved the game experience for everyone.  <P> So of course, with so many positive elements resulting in that, Verant had to stop it.  Can't have everyone actually having fun without 2/3 of their time being spent in frustration.  Can't have people not being greedy and squabbling, right Verant?  <P> The comment about player economy is of course egregious, since the number one element of an economy, the trade skills, are consistently ignored and gimped by Verant. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR><BR>I just read someone making a comment about things being "handed to you."  Not quite.  The monsters that dropped these things were tougher than other mobs their level in other parts of Norrath, just going to the zone and fighting required a group and a lot of risk, and the zones were wide open and filled with high level monsters.  <BR> The point is, that if you went there and fought, but did not camp some placeholder spawn for hours and hours, you still had a chance at a decent item.  <BR> Now it is back to the old way.  A single rare spawn has to be camped for hours to gain a decent item that is probably several levels below the level you need to obtain it.  If you think that staring at a placeholder spawn point for 6 hours is the same as having to work for an item, I guess the discussion is pretty pointless. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

And that is playiong 20+ hours a week.<P>So on Monday I retired my level 27 Paladin, quit the Lanys server and made a Necro on the new server. If I'm going to have fun, it might as well be with a class that can whoop ass and can "BIND" itself.<P>Perhaps someday I'll take my "then" level 50+ Necro and twink the ever living Hell out of a Paladin so I can have "fun". Better yet, wait and get stuff from Kunark.
