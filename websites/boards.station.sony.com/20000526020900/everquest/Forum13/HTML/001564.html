</FONT><HR>I believe agi takes penalties (or loses bonus) once you hit 15 weight.  Everyone in my guild is pretty confident that dex does nothing for monks, but of course, we don't know for sure.

</FONT><HR>the wgt requirement says that you start to loose Att and AC after you hit 15lbs, and it goes down real fast at that point.  At low lvls, str and stm are nice, but I have heard different things about high lvls.  The only thing they all agree on is ignore str, you can't carry much any way, go for agi, and possibly either stm or dex.  Agi will be your main attribute, put at least 10 in there, and you can either put 5 and 5 in stm and dex, or just 10 in one of those two.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Being a lvl 50 monk, and having full shiverback/dragon/god gear I have found to my advantage that I like str above all else. I pull at times for my guild and I find no diffrence in AC vs. Atk. For instance, one time while bored, I dueled another lvl 50 monk in the guild. He prefers AC above Atk, this duel was basically a draw, he ended up winning, yet I knocked him unconscience (sp). It is basically what you enjoy in a char. I enjoy the ability to beat up on a mob easily and not worry about getting hit because I know my cleric will be there to save me. This is just my opinion and I think overall it does not matter much.<P>Lazink<BR>Champion of Test of Tactics<BR>Member of FoH<BR>Level 50 Monk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>As a starting character this would be my list of things to do with my character:<P>1.)  Get AGI to 100 <BR>2.)  Get STR to 100 <BR>3.)  Get STA to 100 <BR>4.)  Get AC as high as possible<P>Basically I wouldn't bother intentionally raising stats beyond 100 until I had enough items to get one of the stats to 125.  Once you get 100 in everything focus on AC.  Then some of your equipment will have stat bonuses in addition to good AC.  If you see a stat aproaching a break point (I think those are 125/150/175) then try to push it over the edge if possible.  Otherwise ignore stat items.  <P>This basically holds true for all melee classes except that STR is useful to keep as high as possible so you can carry more (monks don't have this issue).<P>If I were to start a monk today I would go with 93 AGI, 85 STR, 88 STA and 85 DEX.  Then I would give him one of my extra Gold Blackpearl necklaces (wgt. 0.1 +7Dex +7AGI), a lockjaw hide vest (wgt. 1.5 AC 12, +5STA), 2 Jagged Bands (wgt. 0.2 10 AC +6STR total), An executioners Hood (wgt. 0.2 5AC +4STR +9DEX), a Bracer of Erollisi (wgt. 1 5AC +5STR), a Silver Bloodstone earring (wgt. 0.1 +2STA), and a Black Iron Girdle (wgt. 2 AC 6 +5STA)<P>This would bring my stats up to: <BR>100AGI 100STR 100STA 101DEX<BR>AC 38 <BR>Wgt 5.1<P>Now obviously I am capable of twinking myself with all this stuff.  But if you look at the prices on these items anyone could get these things at a reasonable price except maybe the blackpearl necklace.  By now serpentine bracers (AC1 +9AGI +3DEX) are a dime a dozen on most servers and those would fill in nicely for the necklace with some changes to your starting stats.  Especially since you don't NEED to get dex above 100.  Since almost all of these things add a decent amount of AC and none of them weigh very much except the tunic and the girdle you still have plenty of room for raw silk, cured silk, woven, or mesh armor in the remaining locations.  <P>I imagine the total price of outfitting yourself this way would be about 200-300 plat.  If you have a character level 25+ you can go get more or less all of these items yourself if you wanted to.  If you are worried about the executioners hood, don't be.  People practically throw those away these days.  Usually people camping the axe argue over who gets stuck with the hood!<P>As for the lizard men.  Same rules apply.  Find out what the starting stats are.  If AGI and DEX are going to be very high (95 each for instance) then put all your points into STR and STA with a tendency towards STA because quite frankly STA items are much hard to get than STR items. <P>Mathilda<P>Cleric of Bristlebane <P>(yeah, yeah, I know what is a cleric doing on this board...

</FONT><HR>arentol, I don't know what server you are on, maybe Fennin or another old and over crowded one, but on the newer servers like Druzzil, which is what I am on, and I assume Luclin and Lans Ty'val, that stuff will run you far more than that.  The Serp bracer alone goes for 150-200pp, and saw one guy yesterday asking for 300pp.  The bracers of erollise aren't bad, at 40-60pp each, but the cheapest I have seen an exe hood go for is 500pp, and it is usually nearly twice that.  The LJ tunic is the cheapest item you will find, and you can either hunt it at 15 in a group or pay about 30pp for it.  The jewelry is expensive with only a handle full of enchanters able or willing to work in gold and plat, which will run you alot, and unless they have changed the bi armor in the past 2 weeks, monks can't wear the bi girdle.  As for the other stuff, great, if you can find it, but unless I am off my mark, the stuff you suggested would cost between 1.5k and 2k pp to try to buy.  This might be completely different on other servers, and if so, have fun with your great prices and free exe hoods, but on the new servers, that just doesn't hold true.  I don't like to tweak my characters, which definetly has an impact upon what I can and can't afford, and if you want to tweak your monk, have fun, but as a word of warning, the few monk items after cured silk are almost all planes gear and nearly all no drop.<P>Fany, lvl 13 monk<BR>Dragon Avengers of Norrath<BR>Druzzil Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I guess I was wrong about the girdle there.  I should have researched that one a little closer.  I believe howerver that with some tweaking this would work.  Maybe one of the monk quest sashes would do the job of raising STA.<P>As for prices.  The person has asking has obviously played his current characters for a while.  This implies he is not on a new server.  On old servers getting most of this stuff is much easier.  <P>I said I would use the GBP necklace I already have.  I never once mentioned plat items at all.  I suggested you could substitue a serpentine bracer for the GBP since the serpentine is cheaper.  Since I have seen people give those away on older servers just because people were friendly to them I really doubt they will be so high priced anywhere but new servers.  Plus many people are trying to get rid of there bracers so they can get higher AC items.  Lets do the math:<P>Serpentine Bracer:  40PP (at most)<BR>Lockjaw Hide vest:  Campable by poster<BR>2 jagged bands:     50PP (for both)<BR>Executioners hood:  150PP  (go to Lower and buy it there and people will charge less)<BR>Silver bloodstone earrings:  10PP (less really)<P>So far we are at 200PP <P>A couple other items to replace the Black Iron Girdle and make up for the serpentine bracer/GBP necklace issue would probably be campable or cost under 100PP.<P>So at most it would be 300PP.<P>If you are on a new server that was your choice to make and it will take 6 months for prices to get in these ranges.  That is just the way it works in this game I am afraid.  Compareing my information and prices to a new servers prices is comparing apples and oranges.  I was not wrong at all about the feasability of this.  I thank you for pointing out to everyone that it is not reasonable on a new server though.  <P>Mathilda <P>Cleric of Bristlebane<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Again,<P>The only person here who REALLy knows what they are talking about is the 50th monk who posted earlier, and Mathilda.<P>If you are a monk, put 15 pts into STR.  Put the other 5 pts wherever you want, but I'd probably say AGI just for the hell of it.<P>At 50th level, all AC starts to even out due to the "law of diminishing returns" that EQ adheres to.<P>Adding 15 to sta would give you about 130 more HP at level 50 if you were a warrior, but would only give you about 50 more if you were a monk. Not worth it.<P>Face it people, monks either pull or attack/damage. They dont tank.  Defense for a monk comes second to doing the most damage the quickest.  If you are in the planes pulling, and if FD doesn't work, no amount of HP or AC in the world is gonna save your ass, short of a miracle.<P>Go 15 STR.  This will mean 1 to 2 pts of more damage PER HIT at level 50.  And, if you saw how fast a level 50 monk with a haste item (CoF, sash, or Rakusha) coupled with a Swift like the Wind hits, you'd appreciate the extra 300 pts of damage.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Pezz Kneecrusher</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Oh, forgot,<P>To address Matty's point.<P>yes, in the early and mid levels; unless you can put your stats over the next "tier" (they seem to be 100, 125, 150, 175, except for STR which is every 10 pts until you reach 150 or so), it is better to hold off and try to put something else at the mark.<P>But, at level 50, go with all the STR you can, along with AC and light weight.  (resists, too for raids).  Matty's idea is a solid one, but when you are 50th, and not using that equipment anymore, then those starting stats are just wasted.<P>Pezz</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I have even seen this over the past 6 months with the tank I used to have on Fennin Ro.  It all depends upon where you fight as to what you can get and at what prices.  I can't speak for high lvl monks (only 13 right now) but I have seen some difference in my dmg with a +10 str and +10 stm I started with.  I am doing about 1-2 points more per hit than other monks my lvl without that str, and I have about 15 more hp.  I have put my agi over a hundred right now so I can hit more often than not, but I plan to go for AC items once I can afford them (sigh, 150-200pp for forman's, even more for other good lightweight armor).<P>Fany, lvl 13 monk<BR>Dragon Avengers of Norrath<BR>Druzzil Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Personnaly i added 5 to my INT when i started out and have been quite happy with the result.  I maxed out my combat skills 3-4 lvls sooner than a friends monk with base INT and it has helped on my trade skills(since to be a master tailor you must also work brewing and smithing)Anyway thats my 2cp.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I have a level 30 Monk.  I put all my starting points into Str.  My agi is currently 85, and im doing just fine.  Even with agi buffs, bringing my agi up to 115 or so seems to make very little difference.  In fact it seems to make no difference.  If you dont put those extra points into Str, (by level 20-25) you will be kicking yourself. Sure Str items are out there, and by that time you may have a few.. but add 20 to your total. Str makes a very pretty big differece in your damage output at higher levels.  At low levels 1-19 all monks hit, and behave the same. Stats mean nothing. Shoot for high Str, AC, and youll be set. )<BR>jlink</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum13&number=13&thisthread=001564&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum13&number=13&thisthread=001564&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
