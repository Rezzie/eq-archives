&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I just wanted to clarify a few things about the threads that I have been starting, the Class Talk threads.<P>The most important thing to remind everyone about is that I am just gathering ideas to bring to the team.  Nothing suggested, either by myself or by you, is set in stone.  Ideas that make sense to me will be brought to the team to evaluate.  For the most part, it is unlikely that we will implement any majority of these ideas.  Implementing any more than a few of them would most likely throw things even further off balance…<P>I also wanted to stress that the general idea of these threads is to look at the balance of the classes.  As most of you know, we still intend to bring the game to a point where we are content with the balance of all of the classes so that we can stop expending our time worrying about the balance of classes and use that energy for providing new content and other cool things.  My intent with these threads is, primarily, to be ready when that time comes, and to have a solid idea of your opinions on the classes.<P>However, there is no reason not to include bugs and other such things in these talks.  So go ahead and give me those too.<P>Some have suggested that I should start these threads in the class specific boards.  Well, perhaps I should have.  But I don't want it to seem like I only want opinions from people that play the class being discussed.  I actually want input from anyone that has ideas.<P>I am also getting a fair amount of e-mail with suggestions and ideas.  While I don't really mind getting them, I would much rather that ideas be posted in the threads.  I want everyone to have all the information that I have from the players, so it can be debated and discussed.  And since I am now spending nearly every minute reading these threads, I find it harder to read long e-mails about those same topics…<P>I have created a hasty and very changeable schedule for these posts.  I reserve the right to adjust this list at any time.  And the order is pretty random, since I won't really be taking action on them until later.<P>Already started:<P>Shadow Knights (today)<BR>Clerics<BR>Wizards<BR>Necromancers<BR>Magicians<P>I know, some of these were not specifically Class Talk threads.  But I do feel that I have a solid grasp on the concerns of these classes, as the threads about them (necromancers, for example) were the inspiration for this whole Class Talk idea.<P>Enchanters:  Friday, Jan. 26th  (I may very well be reading this one during the Superbowl…)<BR>Bards:  Monday, Jan. 29th<BR>Warriors:  Monday, Jan.  29th<BR>Monks:  Wednesday, Jan. 31st<BR>Rogues:  Friday, Feb. 2nd<BR>Paladins:  Monday, Feb. 5th (or Tuesday the 6th, since I may very well be stuck in Baltimore…)<BR>Rangers:  Wednesday, Feb. 7th.<P>Once I have all of the ideas I can stand for all the classes, I will re-post the lists that I have gathered.  I might very well do that on the class specific boards.  The lists will always be open to change, so it's not like I'll be posting a 'final' version.  But the lists, at that point, should be pretty solid.<P>At some future date I hope to update these lists with notes as to the status of those ideas.  If implemented, I hope to give you some details about the form of that implementation (though I don't plan to give out formulas or such things), and if they are not going to be implemented, I hope to tell you why not.<P>Again, I want to stress that NONE of these lists or talks include any sort of promise that the ideas in them will be added to the game.  I will simply be providing the team with the lists.  And when I give you my opinion about an idea, it's just that, my opinion.  I'm just one guy.  I have the ability to make suggestions and I get to argue with the team about the value of those ideas.  But we look at these things as a team, and we make these decisions as a team.<P>That's why the game is as cool as it is.<P>I also wanted to apologize for not posting as frequently during the next few weeks.  I am pushing to get all these talks done as soon as I can.  I think they are important.  But reading all these posts is eating up all of my time.  Formatting and rewriting those ideas is taking up time that I don't even have.  So my ability to post for a while will be reduced significantly.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Attaining class balance is like trying to attain oneness with the Universe. It's not the goal which is fulfilling, it's the journey. <P>I doubt you'll ever get to a point where even Verant feels the classes are balanced. They may *SAY* they think the classes are balanced, but I doubt they'll actually believe it deep down. It's just one of those things that's always gonna need tweaking. <P>Still, it's a nice dream, and if ya don't shoot for it, how are you gonna prove me wrong?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I disagree... I think the classes are becoming more balanced.<P>Look at rogues.  Seen a rogue complaint on here lately?  Are they overpowered?<P>Hah.  Oh no.  I'm a rogue, lvl 22, and sometimes can get whipped trying to solo a green mob.  Even if I use poison.<P>Look at Druids.  In a group, are they overpowered?  Oh no.  Solo, yes, but kiting is the cause.  And people can, and do, die kiting, and it's boring.  Their choice.  Druids seem well balanced...<P>Look at wizards.  A dwindling legacy.  Not many of them around now for some reason.  Must be something wrong.<P>Rogues used to be the #1 complained about class on this board.  Now you NEVER see a post concerning them.  Nor do you see a post from someone saying you need to nerf the rogue's abilities.  That, to me, implies that they're balanced now.<P>/em steps off soapbox<P>Please let's have a talk about PvP.  I wanted to do it, but things are crap right now as they stand.  Not due to VI, but due to the fact that people simply cannot help but take advantage of whatever tricks they have at hand.  What I've read concerning the PvP Good vs. Evil idea sounds glorious.  Most all role-players, if not all, would go to this server.  We'd get the role-playing server we wanted.  Would c00l d3\/\/d5 come to the server?  Probably.  Then we could kill them.  Sounds like fun.<P>PvP should certainly be looked at.  The team servers, while a good idea and attempt, were simply that.  With all the work and evolution that goes into the blue servers, why not try focusing a but on the good vs. evil idea.  Who knows, people may go wild over it and all migrate to it, causing the focus of EQ to shift and its longevity to increase.<P>I for one think this is a valid thing that needs to be talked about between the customers of VI and VI itself.  <P>Also, serious kudos to VI for talking to us and doing what we ask.  If they take a long time, and sometimes disagree, well....<P>How many other companies that make games give a damn about what we think?<P>*shrug*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree with Groller.<P>There is no way in heck Verant is going to be finished with class balance.  For instance, let's assume they think they are and start adding more super hard zones. <P>Enter Velious.  <P>In Velious, Enchanters can't do what they usually do best-mez.  All they do now is buff.  I think taking an entire spell line out of a class's line up is kind of whacks out the balance.

</FONT><HR>Groller - not necessarily.  Effectiveness can translate to balance in most situations, assuming classes are equally effective in the grand scheme of things.  True, there are situations that call for one class over another, but the true question is... are there an equal number of situations in which each individual class is preferred over the others for their unique and useful traits, and their effectiveness?  If so, then balance is there.  If not, then a problem has arisen.  High level groups say they have to have an enchanter and cleric.  Then there's something wrong.  Never heard a high level group say they needed a rogue, or a ranger, or a shaman... does that mean they couldn't use them?  Heck no.  Just means that they'll take pretty much anyone, but they feel they NEED those two classes.  So there's a balance issue.  Rather than farm out cleric and enchanter abilities, why not think up new abilities for the other classes that can take the place of the earlier abilities...  Why not a AoE instill doubt that the rogue can use that perhaps takes all the members of your group out of the fray for two seconds but almost always works and is a discipline that is once an hour or what have you?  While that doesn't exactly = replacement for enchanter mez, it helps... or perhaps rogues could have a paralyzing fear ability, effectively rooting and terrifying a creature but also making it so the rogue himself couldn't move either, having to retain eye contact with the enemy...<P>While that was rogue stuff, well, was the first thought off top of my head.  Fact of the matter is, when all the classes are equally effective in different situations, and no class is really NEEDED for the majority of situations, well... <P>Depends on your definition of balance.  In my book, there you have it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>These "talk" threads are an excellent idea to get our opinions on improving the classes and I for one appreciate your efforts, Verant.<P>BUT...<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/confused.gif"><P>I really think you are missing the bigger problem.  The class imbalance issue is of little concern when compared to a bigger problem, Verant's constant handicapping of the role playing environment in EQ.  <P>I am referring to the infamous Play Nice Policy.  Many experienced role players like myself consider this a slap in the face.  This well intentioned but poorly thought up policy was designed to prevent the few "Bad Attitude" players from ruining the game for everyone else, but in essence, this policy punishes us all.<P>The majority of people I talk to not only depise the Play Nice Policy, but make it a point to single out and alienate those that do use it to their advantage.  This is especially true amongst higher level characters who work hard to get a spawn site broken and then wait hours for the single opportunity to attack a target.  To have a weaker or less disciplined group come over and use the PNP to seize the camp is the ultimate frustration I have experienced in EQ.<P>Kill Stealing is wrong.  Starting Trains is wrong.  Hogging a Spawn site for "Farming" is wrong.  I think we can all agree on this.   I knew how to handle obnoxious and thoughtless idiots way before the Play Nice Policy came along and forced martial law onto my server.  The Play Nice Policy is hamstringing all of us and it is protecting me very little.  <P>Start a Play Nice Policy Talk and see for yourself the reaction of your players.  Hopefully you will see how wrong and offensive it is.  If nothing else, maybe you will receive some ideas on how to improve it and give us some more freedom in the game.<P>Before the PNP came along, I had a list of names of people who Kill Stealed, Trained, and were plain rude.  Don't you think it curious that many of those same people I now witness using the PNP to take Spawn sites they did not earn?  You guys are helping the enemy and you do not know it yet.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Let me propose this counterthought, if you will please.<P>I can't speak for every class, but I find the idea that at one point Verant will declare the classes "balanced" and be done with it to focus on new content disturbing.<P>While I'm all in favor of new content, I must say that new content can reshape class balance without actually making large changes to the classes themselves.<P>Take Velious as a perfect example. Now I haven't seen much of Velious but I've heard enough about it to see that it affects class balance quite a bit. I won't go into the specifics, I'm sure you've heard them before. The balance shifts, and perhaps balance needs to be looked at in light of the environment, whether that's available equipment, spells, type of beasts or specific characterists of the beasts we face, even zone design or layout can have quite an impact on class balance.<P>Now, I want to see focus on new content to be sure, but on the other hand, I'm convinced it would be a mistake to ever "close the book" on class balance. I believe Verant needs to try to achieve a "final" balance with the current world as a reference point and that's fine, but without some periodic tuning (call it class maintenenace?) from time to time, the balance will certainly slip through the cracks in time as surely as a handful of water.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think many classes are getting closer to being ballanced, there are many dungeons now that have the need for a rogue. <BR>Rogues have always done a great deal of damage, and now are required as a bonus. <BR>Tanks are always needed for any dungeon, and with them is a healer. <BR>SK & Pallys are half tank, half healer. And with exp penalty off, they are very welcomed as a tank. <BR>Monks can melee like crazy, and pull very well. Needed for most encounters. <BR>Druids and rangers add to damage, and druids can evac, which is needed in many dungeons.<BR>Wizzards are one of the only casters that can damage creatures consistantly at high levels.<BR>Mages and necros have pets (good and bad) and the group ability at high levels is trying to be adjusted.<BR>Shamen can cast a variety of spells, and thus help in varrious ways.<BR>Bards help overall effectiveness, and can turn the tides on a battle, or can just speed up the outcome.<BR>Clerics are the most efficient healers, and thier role has not changed from 1-60, for the most part.<BR>Enchanters give up thier frail nature for the ability to crowd control.<P>Overall since the hybrid penalties have been taken out, and many changes before, the classes are on the way to being ballanced. Anyone could cry nerf the &lt;insert class here&gt;, but hopefully we will see a ballance due to keeping the roles rather than killing the prime abilities of a class.<P>On a side note, I have been in a few very successful groups with no primary classes. Bard, ranger, rogue, necro, mage, shamen. I was very uneasy when deep in a dungeon with this group, but it was very exciting, and when players know thier class and abilities, everything works out great.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor:<BR>Besides, having the classes balanced does not mean that we never give them new things. It just means that we give them new things that are balanced and set them on top of the already balanced things, and nothing falls over.<P>So...is the balance with relation to the environment or with relation to the other classes?<P>If the balance is in relation to the environment you cannot add to the environment without adding to classes.  If it is in relation to other classes then every ability given to a class must be matched by an equal ability in each other class.<P>Now before you go saying, "Well in Vellious we gave everyone new abilities" think about the abilities in relation to the difficulty of Vellious.  I'm not high enough to go there yet, but reading the reports of the mobs there and thinking about the spells given to my class...not really balanced.  Mages got as their only new combat spell a mana inefficient line of dots.  They got an improvement on Burnout and a line of useless pet summons weaker than our current pets.  A reasonably useful summoned NO DROP item.  How are these meant to help us take out the new zone?<P>As far as balance with regard to other classes goes...ask a ranger if he feels balanced.  Ask a paladin, or a mage...hell, ask anyone who isn't a great solo (necro/druid) or a must have (warrior/cleric/chanter) if they feel balanced.  Note that I left mages out of that great solo thing...sorry, we can do it, but we have massive downtime and risk losing half our xp to the pet.<P>Lzoril</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/051603-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/051603-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/051603-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=051603&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=051603&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
