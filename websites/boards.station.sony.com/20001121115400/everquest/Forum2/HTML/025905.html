</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;I walk into Qeynos hills isee 10 people fighting for pyzjn and another 10 fighting for the miller spawns<P>When people choose to go to the most popular areas to fight the most popular critters, of course there's going to be a line.  That's why areas are considered popular, because there's always people there.  <P>At the same time that you have 10 people fighting for both of those spawns, you'll find other areas empty.  People who make the choice to visit them can find more than enough to do.<P>The point being that even on the most underutilized areas, the popular areas are still popular.  There's always places to go where you don't have to fight over spawns if you're willing to do it.<P>-Gordon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I play on Innoruuk, another server just waiting for a split, and I have never seen the Miller's camped - if thats true, its got to be bad on SolRo.  Regardless, people will always go where the risk reward ratio is reasonable... people do not go to under-utilized areas for a reason - the risk is WAY to high.  Do I want to hunt in Lesser Fay and risk the wandering brownie scouts?  No... Do I want to go to Velious where I can't bind and enjoy a long corpse recovery?  No.  It might be worth considering the player base's idea of risk vs. reward in contrast to that of Verant's..  and I think you will find a significant difference.<P>Your under-utilized zones will remain that way until there is a good reason to go there.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Jeez, the old "just leave then" excuse. Not every zone supports every level player and at the choke points of 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 the zones are too few and way to crowded. Nothing ruins the immersive quality of the game like a waiting list.<P>The under utilized zones are under utilized for a reason: there is no meaningful reason to go there. <P>The fact is that at 2000+ people server performance bites, there are too many people for too few good spawns, and even in the outdoor zones only a few can support constant pulls or high level players. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>oh yeah, I forgot....read the blasted board...Sol Ro is not overcrowded!!!   It's a bug....Verant can't code things to count correctly if the numbers they count make them seem wrong.  I know you THINK you saw 10 people fighting Pyzjn, but they were 10 people that had been in the zone that camped or went linkdead and were just being counted as being there.<P>And gfay doesn't really crash multiple times a day on the weekends....that's probably all 157 people in the zone having individual isp problems simultaneously.<P>I mean really...coincidences happen, so why not give Verant the benefit of the doubt (that is, if there is anything to doubt)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>http://www.everlore.com/status.htm<P>The above is a link to a site that shows the population of all of the servers in the last 24 hours.  Solusek Ro probably has the highest average population, hitting a max of 2105 people during prime time.  Karanas comes close though, with another high average population and 2058 max.  However, it looked like 7 or 8 different servers had a higher max population (though I didn't record them all).  Cazic Thule had 2311 people at peak, Povar, which is up for the next split, had 2278 and The Rathe had 2274 (and is about to be the only original server that has never been split).  Eh, its peak populations that cause the most zone overcrowding and Solusek Ro doesn't have as large of a problem with peak populations as other servers.<P>I heard that the Rathe has more than 55 planes capable guilds 3 months ago  There have been days when a level 1 could walk all the way through guk without ever being in danger, and people go linkdead rather regularly in GFay.<P>Unfortunately, overcrowding is not unique to Solusek Ro.  Eh, SolRo might have a problem with a high average population, and Saturday afternoons are probably extremely laggy, but is the peak overcrowding worse than other servers?  Perhaps Sol Ro needs a split soon, I don't have any experience there, but you all make it sound like overcrowding only happens on your server.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

But we don't!<BR>Why?<P>Lousy risk and rewards! (Hits surrounding area with the bat of obvious truth!) Why risk horrible death and lose hours of play (from lost exp and CR) when you can have an enjoyable time in better designed zones and mobs? Sheesh... <P>No this is not an excuse for VI to start using the nerf bat on the popular zones (as a certain former "Internet Relations Manager" would love to do) but what we really need is a concentrated revamp of the underutilized zones. In fact I believe such a revamp would go along way to alleviate overcrowding and to tell the truth obviate the need to have SoV expansion pack to keep players happy...<P>So we have people screaming for splits before each expansion pack when what really is needed is revamps of underutilized zones that would benefit players.<P>Come to think of it, perhaps thats the plan really.

I have yet to see any of them over 1800 people, and most peak times they're at around 1500.  <P>After all, when we complain about the nekkid gankers, your suggestions are to start over on a blue server, so why don't you guys take your own suggestions.  I've never had a problem with the overcrowding situations you're encountering.<P>Besides, there's nothing better than killing someone that steals your kill or ninja loots ya, instead of typing a childish /rude at them.

</FONT><HR>Well .. I said it before and I'll say it again ...<P>The reason Abashi and the rest of Verant will *never* split SolRo again is very simple: Money.  They have a server that is used constantly, a place that everyone keeps coming back to regardless of the [EXPLETIVE].  We are not "overcrowded"; we are "profitable."<P>Why would they want to go out and buy another server (or server cluster) and spend all that money, just for customer service??  This is a company that we all agree seriously does not understand the meaning of "customer service."<P>There is no reason for them to cost justify putting in new servers just to split people off.  To put in new servers for NEW customers (hence additional revenue) -- THAT makes sense to Verant.<P>But they will *never* split SolRo because fiscally it's a bad move.<P>And that's what Verant will *never* admit to.

</FONT><HR>Gordon, try playing the same game as the rest of us, please???  For different level ranges, there are only certain zones that CAN be hunted in, both because of pathing problems, mob levels, mob population density, etc.  Examples of why some zones are underutilized on many servers(I don't play on Solusek Ro, so don't know if this applies):<P>Kedge: It's underwater, not everyone has the spells, or items to hunt there, and the lack of a Z axis being used when deciding if a mob can hit you is non-existant(mobs hit you from 20 feet straight up or down from you)<P>Emerald Jungle, Burning Woods, Trakon's Teeth:<BR>Outdoor zones, lack of good landmarks, easy to get disoriented, and difficult to find groups if you don't come to these zones while grouped.<P>The Hole: Let's see, you need at least two groups of 48+ just to get anywhere, it's a raid only zone, not a hunting zone.  <P>Kithicor: Night only for level 40+ people, difficult to see, and at 40+, groups are required since soloing in the dark tends to be a bad idea.<P>Did I miss any under-utilized zones?  How about Veeshan's Peak?  Oh, don't have the key because you arn't in an Uber-Guild?  <P>There's a lot of reasons why zones are under utilized.  I've played the game for 50 levels as a wizard, I've seen the zones that not many hunt in, or go to.  How about the killer brownies in Lesser Faydark now, that will attract even more people to that zone.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Repost from an earlier thread- in response to Abashi's blatent disregard for the facts:<P><<I'm not trying to flame Abashi here but buddy your numbers dont mean crap. Get on Sol Ro on a weekend. 2600 freakin people. Yeah, the weekend is only 2 days but the point is there are many "weekend warriors" who canonly play on weekends but cant do crap b/c th are jostling elbows with all the Germans who play AM. There's no excuse for a server which is camped all day long. And Sol Ro is.<P>YOU try playing through the insane amount of lag that Sol Ro experienced on Sat and Sun due to server crowding a result of the europen/NA overlap. YOU watch your experience move in the opposite direction b/c of linkdeath. YOU try to head to dungeons like Sebs and HS and have to leave b/c 1 or more of the Ubers has the whole thing camped.  YOU spend time looking for spawns to grind on then actually grinding on them.<P>The comment you made regarding higher levels spreading out. Let me break it down for you at lvl 53. Lets assume for the sake of argument, I am not interested in camping loot, just getting experience. Where can I go:<P>1. Lfay for brownies- Heh, whatever. I'll die over and over and over again.<P>2. Burning Woods- without a tracker, you have the choice of the giant fort or the giant fort. The giant fort is a hotbed of ks'ing activity due to the sheer competition(People when there are 4 people sitting at entrance to the fort, THATS A LINE- dont just run past and take the first blue you see, damn...)<P>3. TT - most everything but the rare spawns is green to me. The stuff that isnt green to me is always camped for quest items (forager,hunter) or is a rare spawn camped items.<P>4. EJ- nearly everything is green to me. The occasional plant or monkey is light blue. Bah.<P>5. TD- spirocs are mostly green and usually camped. Raptors are blue and mostly kited by roughly 5-10 druids/wizards at a time<P>6. Old Sebillis - on Sunday there was 118 people in the zone. Forget about .<P>7. HS - Well I could go but since many of my tanks and clerics are inkies, thanks to Verant "storybased" faction system none of them will go b/c of faction problem with OT.<P>8. Karnors castle- everything in the castle is camped everytime I go. Generally I sit there for 45 mins and shout for a group with no responses. Sometimes I will make my own group but oh yeah everything is camped already when I do. See above for problems with my guildmates faction ([FLAME]) <P>9. CoM - anything shallow is green. Anything deep is uber and camped for Epic quest items.<P>10. OOT- hunted there Sunday all day and died twice due to warping mobs and lag (but oh yeah we dont need a split) [FLAME]<P>11. Chardok- the one place I will admit I do not go to very often.<P>12. Skyfire- there are very limited areas considered safe for grinding exp in Skyfire. Those areas are constantly camped by guilds whose members are 55+ (and there are a lot)so if I'm not in those guilds and I bring a group, I am spammed across OOC and shout for being in that groups camp area/<P>13. VP - oh yeah, Paradigm has monopoly on Trak so I can forget about ever going much less seeing Trak<P>14. Dreadlands- the occasional wandering mob is blue but the numbers are few and far b/t<P>15. ETC- MM, Kithicor, Lguk, Kedge are not suitable for exp grinding in my opinion but Guk and MM are always camped for loot.<P>Am I missing anything?<P>So Abashi, your comment about us spreading out is [EXPLETIVE]. I'm not an ebay farmer and I'm not in a uber guild. I don't care about the loot (only b/c there is no point, everything is always freakin camp). My alternative to having loot and cash in game is leveling as well as I can. So until you actually play 50+ character on Sol Ro (and judging by your comments, you dont) dont come on this board and tell me I can find some place to go and there are not too many high level players. <P>In conclusion, there is not a good reason for Sol Ro to not be split. Maybe its b/c of the Germans. Maybe you hate us [EXPLETIVE]all the time about a split. BUT the lag I encountered server wide is not acceptable and neither is the exp loss that came with it.<P>Care to respond Gordon ?? I can't think of a time I've ever directly addressed you, even when I disagreed with you but your post re: Sol Ro evidences your complete lack of knowledge on the subject, in addition your complete disregard for the people who play on that server and have been begging for a split for months.<P>Sorry for the harsh words, losing exp post 51 due to lag issues does that to me.<P>Skystreak Cloudrider<BR>Wizard of 53rd Circle<BR>STILL on Sol Ro<P><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]

</FONT><HR>Oh yes I was negligent in responding the something TheDocster said earlier.  <P>Sure there are several mid-level dungeons I could go explore.  Of course at 53, those mid-lvl dungeons are all green and dont do me a bit of good.  <P>The reason ??  Because the 35% of the 50+ players that Abashi commented on play 75% of the time and since there are so many high lvl players, everything is camped all day, every day.  I cant go to Kurns Tower or Kaesora b/c I am too high and worked too damn hard to get  to 53 to give up.  Would I have to abandon my primary who I have worked 75+ days to get to lvl 53, not to mention spend hours upon hours in Faymart, the most unstable freakin zone the game, to properly outfit my him?  Hell no, how fair is that.<P>Criminey people wonder why our server is full of twinks.  I have a lvl 15 bard in full lambent, a 20th warrior in full crafted with some of the better blades in the game, a 22 lvl fully equiped necro and a lvl 10 rogue in full ravenscale.  Why do I have these twinks?  BECAUSE IM BORED when I cant find an open camp with my primary.  So I run around doing quests that only take one person at my lvl b/c nothing else is available to me.  does that take these items away from characters of lower level?? Yep it does and to be honest, I really hate that.  BUt Verant makes me do it- what else is left to do at high lvls if you are not in a Uber killing dragons, gathering loot or grinding experience.  I'm hoping to get some of my twinks up to the levels that I can explore the new dungeons but in all honesty, I shouldnt have to stop playing my primary b/c of the lack of a server split.<P>Yes the game is about exploring- I've been through nearly every zone in the game.  I've swam in Kedge, killed Innorek's clerics by the dozens in Hate, spit in the eye of Vox, been chased by undead in Kithicor, and had my butt handed to me by mobs that hit way above their level in skyfire. I've been everywhere for the most part and to be honest with you, alot of everywhere is boring or useless (I cite nearly the entire continent of Odus AND the Hole due to Verants complete failure to address the mezzing problem).<P>There is a problem on Sol Ro's server.  There are too many people playing 24 hours a day.  The sheer amount of high lvl players 50+ bogs down the high lvl areas (for crying out loud, Paradigm wont even take anyone less than 50 and they've got at far more than 50 people) The weekends are about unplayable (and if I'm not watching football, I'm playing on Sat. b/c its the only time I have that I can play catch up to the kids that have nothing but time to play EQ) and many of us can't stay on all night and play due to work committments.<P>And the next person who brings up the damn /movelog from months back I'm going to nuke.  We had TWO hours notice- who is going to risk a move when they dont know if their friends or guild is going to move. I remember furiously scrambling around to see if my guild was moving and of course nobody knew.<P>Personally, I dont think Abashi has done anything but look at the numbers of average play time. Look at the responses he has made to this issue (see the thread about thee new server split) And the numbers, in the SPECIFIC case of this server, dont mean a damn thing.  For you on other servers, please stop posting your statistics and telling us we need to get over it.  YOU dont play on Sol Ro either and dont understand the problem.<P>This issue is not going to die Verant.  Every time I go linkdead 5 times in the span of an hour on a weekend or Faymart crashes b/c its so bogged down, I'm going to start another thread.  and you know whats funny?  I dont even know if I'll move- but I bet some of the Ubers will move en masse and just getting them out of each others hair and mine would be a significant step in improving problems.  OR better yet, start a new "European Server" and encourage the Europs to start over there (actually I want the Brits to stay - I love learning how to call people bloody wankers and have many good British friends) <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The more i hear from you gordon, the more i think you dont know what you are talking about, this game was designed for camping, at least, everyone has to do it to get some sorts of nice items. Leveling is cool, but it gets boring to have all the same items level after level.... sometimes i need some new stuff. But there is ALWAYS someone camping where i want to be.<P>Take exemple with the Frenzied ghoul of Guk, he is camped 24/24 7/7 and this for the last 6months at least. Why not adding same items on other mobs in other dungeons? No, would make too many fbss and that would drop the value on ebay. This was just an exemple, there is plenty of them.<P>/shout camp check!<P>/ooc frenzied<BR>/ooc savant<BR>/ooc magi<BR>/ooc lord<BR>/ooc sage<BR>/ooc ass/sup<BR>/ooc exe<BR>/ooc spider room  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>/ooc king<BR>/ooc bunker<P>***,lets take the bedroom oh wait, the elder isnt camped<P>/ooc elder<BR>/ooc Cav<P>grrrrr,lets go hunt HG.... they must be camped tho.Bet sol b is full too, we could go to karnor but... oh well, i' ll go play my alt, he is 8, got new spells.<P>6 months later....<P>alt shouts: Camp check!<P>you know the rest.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Geez, point out that Abashi ignores 90% of a thread to FLAME the remainder himself gets your post deleted as a flame....<P>Forget that everything that I said was true... truth only confuses the matter, don't it?<P>We have a valid point and deserve a split.  You acknowledge that we have one of the highest high level pops, yet you make poorly designed 'Train Stations' for zones.  You admit that we have the highest average (overall) population throughout the day, yet you keep spawns at the same slow rate.<P>We either need you to fix those problems or give us a serious split.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just a couple other things very noticeable on solusek ro...<BR>The overall pop is higher then other servers because of the very large European and American players on it. Verant dismisses the pop problem by stating its spread out across 24 hours. Now, the planes repop on 12 hours or so, the big mobs we need repop on 12 hour, 3 day and 1 week times. We cant hunt these because Solusek Ro's world of Norath has a population tht is through the roof!<BR>Ok, why dosnt verant just place 4 more ice giants and another gate model at the back entrance to permafrost (u know along the north wall) It'll give ppl something to kill, more ppl will come up north. If that works well (as it would) Verant make another fort model on the southern wall of the zone and put in 4 more ice giants. now was THAT hard? NO! and god you just added enjoyment, xp, and freed up some of the other over camped zones. That example is ONLY permafrost! imagine what u could do with some consultation from some experienced high level players. do this to ALOT of zones. Verant, I could go on with a low cost, fast turn-around, specific action plan if you like.<P>Sorack<BR>Solusek Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hey look at that.  Another reasonable solution to the Sol Ro problem besides a split.<P>LOGIC !!! Prepare for a nerf.<P><BR>(FYI I'm all for a solution that provides any level of additional support for the 50+ player- for those of you under 50, trust me when I tell you this is a trickle down effect- more stuff to do post 50 = fewer twinks = more uncamped low/mid range areas.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I keep hearing about other servers....we arnt complaining that YOU get a split, we are saying WE SHOULD ALSO.  But lets look at you for a minute.  You have what, maybe 1 or 2% population over lvl 55?  I'll give you 7% over lvl 50?  Maybe 30% over lvl 40 (primaries only.)  sol-ro.  We have 10-12% over lvl 55, 40-42% over lvl 50, and AT LEAST 70-80% over lvl 40!  <P>Abashi, go camp somewhere else?  Where?  Even dagnor's cauldron is camped for crying out loud!  Twinks are pulling whole zones because they have high levels with nothing better to do but powerlevel and htey have full sets of lvl 50+ armor!  I've seen lvl 10 warriors in cobalt!  Uber guilds OWN certain spawns, they have them on timer and show up about 4 hours before they spawn and get ready.  Epic quests?  Please, unless you are in Darkwind, Bunnies of Chaos or Paradigm dont bother.  The end spawns are all on timer.  (I only singled out those three guilds because I have seen members in them with epic weapons, no flame intended.)<P>Gimme a break, its YOUR fault you never put a cap on population per server.  We (the Beta Testers and Starters in Retail) WARNED you!  We knew this was going to happen!  Everyday our lvl 55+ population increases exponentially.  By December 90% of our primary character population will be lvl 60.  Now, unless Scars of Vellios comes with 13 new zones designed with mobs lvl 55+ with GOOD loot (not high level loot, good loot, like more FBSSs, more Lamentations, more Jady Maces, etc) this problem will not go away. (Personally, I wont purchase SoV unless I hear from a few people that there are many new zones to hunt in.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/025905-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/025905-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=025905&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=025905&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
