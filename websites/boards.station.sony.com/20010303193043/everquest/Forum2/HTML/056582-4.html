</FONT><HR>I just wanna clarify something... when we as rogues talk about "stackable poisons" we are NOT talking about making poisons stack with other spells, or making it so we can put more than one poison on a weapon.  We just want to make it so all our 10 or 20 asp poisons take up 1 slot in our inventory rather than 20.  Poison would be used a lot more if you didn't have to dedicate half your inventory to carrying them.  It's also a double penalty, in that not only do you have to spend money to fill your inventory with poisons, but you also have less slots afterwards to fill with loot for more money for those poisons.  As it is now, I have an entire 10 slot backpack dedicated to carrying the reagents for whatever poison I'm using at the time, since it takes up less space than carrying the 50 or so poisons it makes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have played EQ for almost 2 years now. The past 6 months or so I have barely played, and pondered quitting the game. I started a new character about a month ago to mess around with a friend on a new server. It was a class I had never played before, a Rogue. Since I started that character, I have had more fun in EQ than I ever had before. I'm staying up too late, not getting enough sleep and driving home too fast just to play her.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> She is now lvl 43, and I just can't imagine what this proposed Evade nerf will do. I get beat on enough with evade in its current state. All my newfound enjoyment will go away if I just become a speedbump to Drolvargs and Brutes.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><BR>Please please don't do this. <P>Sammah<BR>43rd Rogue of Bristlebane<BR>Saryrn Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I evaded.. it still didn't get off me I ran to her, evaded.. still hung on me. Ran past her it evaded.. still came for me.  Ran way past her, she ran to it, finally got off her, evaded 20 more times to be the last possible thing on its hate list.<BR>Now then.. if I evaded, it it did what you THINK evade does.. wouldn't the SG just run off and attack someone else? Yeah it would, but evade DOESN'T work like that!!

</FONT><HR>Well it might have been said but I have not seen it yet.  How about a "backstab" for 1hb.  It could give a stun effect.  You cand use the backstab key for it but just equip your primary hand with a 1hb.  I don't see to many rogues giving up their piercing backstabs for it but it would sure be fun.  Seems very rogue'ish to be able to sneak up behind someone and 'whack 'em" with a Blackjack!  That would be so in character.  Most important I really dont think it would be unbalancing plus it would allow rogues to build up a skill in something other than piercing.<P>Xachime Xilk<BR>35th Blade<BR>Brell Serilus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I do have some suggestions on rogue on different area.<BR>First of all, the Race. As the most powerful skill of rogues is backstab, and CURRENTLY, the max. backstab depends on STR, thus making the Barbarian and Dwarf best for a rogue. But that make no sense! How come a huge-sized or fatty one is the best rogue? Rogues should be sneaky and dexterious! Make the backstab success rate depends more on DEX and evade success rate depends more on AGI, such that although BAR/DWF might still have the highest backstab damage and hitpoint, they might not hit and evade as frequent as the ELF/HLF/HFL.<P>Secondly, make the rogue weapons lighter. ELF/HLF/HFL rogues don't have high STA, they run out of stamina pretty quick.<P>Thirdly, the 1.5 min. backstab should apply in ALL levels but just not post-50. (a 50 rogue BS for 50 and a 51 rogue BS for 76 is really a big different and BS for 50 in level 50 is really a joke especially when using a 12 dmg weapon which could hit for 50+ normally and it's a shame for rogues)<P>Forthly, add some makable throwing weapon. (maybe there is a new skill) We can make arrows but why we can't make throwing weapons? Try think of when rogues/monks run out of ammo but they still can make some using for example snake tooth, animal claws... that will be great fun.<P>I also have some "agrees":<BR>1. 33% evade calculation.<BR>2. backstab noticable by others like crits.<BR>3. sneak/hide, illusion (also wolf/bear form) zoning.<BR>4. bind wound skill same as monks. (applies to WAR too)<BR>5. increase success rate of ID/Disarm. (I am not asking for MUCH increase but at least some more)<BR>6. better look for the Ragebringer! (perharps fog comes out from the Ragebringer and covers the holder... )<P>Some more fun/minor suggestions:<BR>1. Sum up the total damage of a successful double backstab and give it a name like Deadly Backstab, also make it noticable by others. (I am sure everyone will respect rogues when they see a 800+ damage in 1 hit!)<BR>2. Make successful evade noticable by others. (useful for healers to decide whether to heal the tanks or the rogues first)<BR>3. When ID success, give us the animation of the "kick". (applies to monks too)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You need not worry about nerfing evade.  Today in Velk's lab we fought Velk a few times.  Despite going into the battle at 80-90% life, with a tank on it for 1min or so and then others joining in before me, I managed to jump to the top of the aggro list in 5 seconds without even backstabing.  I kid you not, this happened TWICE.  Didn't have time to evade.  Not only this, another friend of mine had the same thing happen.  Perhaps you'd care to comment on this, because if the aggro list is so buggy that I jump from nothing to top in a matter of seconds with a full aggro list, you need not worry about an evade nerf.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I just have one idea for the rogue class.  This may have been mentioned.<P>I love rogues.  I read a lot of R.A. Salvador books and love the dark elf rogues.  One of the reasons I have never started a rogue in game though is that you have to have a peircing weapon in the primary hand to backstab.  I love to role play and I prefer to have a sword in my primary and dirk, or dagger in second.  But I cant do this because of the way backstab is set up now.<P>Is there a way you can change backstab so that you can do it with a peircing weapon in the secondary hand slot as and not just primary.  I imaging this will cause a problem before you get dual weild.  Then at lvl 10 rogues may beable to backstab with a slashing weapon in there primary.  Maybe you could do and if/then statment to where it says if pericing wepon is in primary or secondary then backstab can be sucsessful.  I dont know just a thought.<P>Thanks<BR>GTLoco</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Only a quick thing to say<P><BR>EVADE--- As it stands, us rogues truly do get hit quite enuff to justify leaving evade where it stands currently.. Factors that cuz this could be hitting the evade at the wrong time (when your getting hit), when stunned, if you move, hell if you dont have a setup that automatically turns off auto-attack... <P><BR>honestly guys (verant) we are doin what we like right now as a rogue class, and to take away part of our greatness only diminishes our class. Warriors, clerics, druids, chanters, and all other classes alike can prolly agree that our current evade skill is not only useful for us, but VERY useful for them..  Hell clerics have enuff to do then continuously heal up the rogue who is trying to de-aggro himself. <P>I mean what you actually want us to do now? Be like casters and wait before we can attack? I dont really see the point in nerfing evade.. How is it SOOO powerful that we need it nerfed? <P>Everyone talks bout the numbers.. like we have 500 aggro and we can drop it or whatever.. Why does this matter? and how does it relate to when your actually playing the game.. Oh we can evade ourselves off onto a warrior...ISNT that the point?! Oh we can evade ourselves onto other rogues.. ISNT that the point?!.. Oh damn we evaded onto our cleric/chanter/caster in general.. Isnt that our punishment enuff? <P>Ok Alan, you told us all bout those ever important figures you made a nice example of, now put it into game terms and examples and tell us WHY there needs to be a nerf in the first place.<P><BR>Oh other notes, <BR>Assassin armor, come on DEV TEAM... WHY YELLOW AND PINK ON BARBS?!?!??!?!?<BR>And the epic.. Why do we have a dot that yoiu can barely see running way too fast across our blade? I mean hell, it doesnt even look like a "poison" which the blade has nothin to do with poison.. Its tainted by Inny, so it should have some kind of sinister effect, not a silly blinking dot.<P><BR>Biguss Maximus<BR>53 Rake of Rallos<BR>Merchants of Honour</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Quote: Essentially, this allows a rogue to do significant damage to an opponent, and then with the use of evade, become less 'hated' than someone that has done no damage to the NPC at all, but just has a somewhat negative faction with that NPC and is standing someplace on the other side of the zone. <BR>THIS IS COMPLETE BULLCRAP! If you can evade and have a mob run to the other side of the zone, I'd like to see it.  You know this is a lie.  Thanks for treating your paying customers like complete morons.  If you think we do too much damage and want to reduce it, at least show some honesty and tell us that.

</FONT><HR>balancing issues.<P>true/false: a rogue is balanced. we have a class that with the right twinking gear can dish out more damage then any other class in the game and giving poisons and potions can duplicate the skills and spells of other classes.<P>truth: with the weapons available by class per level  (ie when they can potentualy be retreaved by that class) i find my rogue do LESS damage then a warrior on a DAMAGE over time ratio. With 1 BS that wont hit for max damage all the tim fallowed by a series of low damaging normal hits then another backstab doing a good amount of damage. where a warrior using a weapon found at the equivelent level will be hitting for 3 times my normal damage and a little less then me backstab damage. this is night counting if he gets a critical blow.<P>truth: poisons require special harvesting of ALL major Ingrediance for EACH poison, not to mention you have to make the poison witch you might fail losing the ingredience you harvested, and still when you apply the poison you might poison yourself and still when you use it in combat it still might not effect the creature your using it on. compare that to the spells, and songs of the other classes and see if it stacks up.<P>truth: we have the hit points of a druid yet we have the agro of a tank, vs these odds we get a nerfed evade, question, did you nerf feign death, last i heard when it works the moster WILL go after a new target, even if there is not a another target withen a THOUSAND miles of the supposedly dead person, evade doesnt even have this much pull now, much less after it is nerfed.<P>truth: Disarm traps is practicly useless, because, there really isnt any traps to disarm.<BR>same goes with locked doors sure its skills rogues would normaly have, but why would you need these skills in a land with no traps to mention and only three locked doors in a dungoen that holds no value whats so ever for a rogue. IE BEFALLEN. i know there are some traps and more locked doors in this game, but really there isnt enough in the right area's to make it viable or a must to have a rogue.<P>truth: we get crits on throwing weapons!!!! um ok so instead of 3 we do 15, maybe 30? the spiffy throwing weapons are warriors and monks only... yet we get the crits with em... <P>ok enough complaints, lets talk about imprvements in the next post.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok here are a few improvements to the class.<P>1: If you want to nerf evade here is a nice perc to balance it out at higher levels:<P>HIDE IN PLAIN SIGHT, meaning that we can just turn off combat and HIDE, this will actually make the evade nerf viable in the long run if we had our own version of feign death  in this form at lvl 60. of course creatures that see invis can still attack us but this will work wonders vs's other things<BR> <BR> 2: poisons need to stack. enough said,<P> 3: give rogues a new skill:<BR>    MAPPING, if we had an automap of a dungeon then i do believe our uses to party will increased. as it stands most people will elect to have any other class then a rogue simply because they dont see any reason to drag us along. at higher levels a tank will sit and take the hits from a mob while the casters nuke, the cleric heals and the bard, necro , or enchanter keeps the mana flowing an do croud controls. druids ,bards and rangers can keep the tracking as far as im concerned, because lets face it, they will take a druid ranger or bard over a rogue any day. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is a post from absor on casters realm um i know i was critical before but if this is true, by all means NERF EVADE! :<P>We've ran through the Evade mechanics I described yesterday, and made a few refinements. <P>If Evading while at the top of the hate list, you will still be moved between the current #2 and #3 person on the hate list. In addition, if the amount of hate reduction calculated is less than 500 actual points, it becomes 500. <P>This insures that Evade will always be at least as effective as Jolt, and it will mitigate the Multiple Rogue Syndrome many of you fear. Example: <P>Rogue1 has 10000 hate <BR>Warrior2 has 9800 hate <BR>Ranger3 has 9795 hate. <P>Using the formula (#2hate-#3hate)/2(+#3hate)=Rogue Evade hate, the Rogue1 would be set to #2 with 9798 hate. 2 points lower than the new #1 player, and 202 points lower than his initial hate. Sucks, doesn't it? <P>Since 202 is less than 500, the actual hate would be adjusted 500 points lower, setting Rogue1 to 9500 hate, which could actually move him lower than #3. Doesn't suck. <P>Now if the three players at the top of the list were all rogues, the rotation of the three would not be as likely, since each one of them drops by a minimum of 500 points, IF there are other non-rogue damage dealers around. The non-rogues are much more likely to claim top spot rather than the trio of rogues. Lets throw some more math out here for you: <P>Above example, Rogue1 just evaded, setting his hate to 9500. <P>Warrior2 is actually Rogue2, with 9800 points of hate, now the top spot. He evades, placing him between 9795 and 9500, which is 9648. 9800-9648 is only 152, so he is bumped down 500 to 9300. <P>Ranger3 is actually Rogue3. He is now in the top spot with 9795. He evades, placed between 9500 and 9300, to 9400. Again, less than 500, so he is moved to 9295. <P>Now, you say that Rogue1 at 9500 should be back on top of the hate list, right? This could be the case, but you have to <P>realize that while these three Evades were going on, there may well have been other damage dealers in the encounter who have exceeded 9500 hate. <P>Each time a string of rogues evades, it becomes more and more efficient for the evader, pushing them down to the point where they are eclipsed by the other damage dealers. <P>We're testing this out now, and so far it looks pretty good. <P>In addition, if Evading while not #1 (pre-Evade), your total hate is reduced by 10% OR 500, whichever is greater, not to go below 128. <P>We've also looked a few more rogue issues, and expect to have them adjusted in the following weeks. None of these are promised, keep this in mind, but we are looking into them. <P>Reduction of Min Range for throwing weapons. Not a removal, but a reduction, to around 3-5 feet. Should make them easier to use. <P>Instill Doubt still on the same timer as it is currently, but allowing that first backstab or special attack to land after ID goes off. This will happen. Still rewards those of you with good timing. <P>Apply Poison putting the Rogue in kneel mode similar to bind wounds, and releasing him when complete. Great player idea, this will probably happen. <BR> <BR> <P>Return to the main news. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>  <BR> <BR> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One of the main flaws of EQ are undoubtly the forced time sinks. One thing is players camping stuff voluntarily, another thing is making camping needed as a part of a quest. Please take away those camps. To have an ubermob fight is 100 times better than a camp. <P>On the Ragebringer quest you need to camp the Kaladim and Neriak guildmasters (cause the note only spawns from time to time), you need to camp the guy in Rathe, you need to camp in High hold, and now you even have to camp Yendar in Steamfont. With forcing camps like this you bore players off a little more each day, and you loose customers.<P>Another way you turn rogue players off is the method we're forced to use to raise pick locks: Sit before a door, press U, press U, press U, press U... that's no way near anything resembling fun.

After about 50%, i can usually keep my evade going to keep him off of me.  <P>This shows..<P>1)I can out taunt a super twinked warrior with my SBD now with the "broken" evade.<P>2)Never, i mean NEVER has a mob turned on the druid when we're fighting it even with her casting G Heal and snare/dot's, so my aggro constantly stays higher than hers.<P>3)Rogues rack up probably 50% more aggro than warriors, so even dropping by 33% would suck.<P>Please dont take away the only reason that I can HOPE to find a group when i'm not with my friends, backstabbin.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I wanted to bring to the attention of all the rogues here at safehouse a disturbing and frustrating event that occured to me last night while exploring on the 6th level of the Tower of Frozen Shadow.<P>I was doing some scouting around (while sneaking/hiding of course) and was having absolutely NO problems.  Everything conned indifferent to me and I had moved pretty deep into the level and well past the keyholder mob for that level (the Genie).  Suddenly for no apparent reason, I go LD and drop to the server selection screen.  I have not gone LD in months and I have a very reliable cable connection.  The fact that I dropped to the server connection screen is suggestive that my ISP did not drop me, but rather one of the countless LD's that seems to be ocouring on The Rathe nearly every evening and weekend.  <P>Ok..so what u say?  Well when I logged back in I was shocked to find that I had apparently died and was back at my bind point naked as a baby.  I of course petitioned the GM and was told that there was NO WAY that the LD was Sony's fault and that under no circumstances could there be anything wrong with the servers to have caused my LD.  I was also told that when going LD that hide/sneak will of course cease to function and thus if you are in the middle of a mob, you will likely be killed.  <P>The point of this whole thing is this.  The GM's did not want to accept any responsibility for any fault regarding my LD, and I didnt want to accept any responsibility either given that I was having NO problems doing what is definately in character for our class.  I absolutely feel that if Sneak/Hide were persistant across zones and when logging out and back in that this would not have been any problem at all.  After all, invis persists both through zones and when camping and through LD.  The unfortunate incident caused me and my group a WHOLE LOT of down time (those that have died in the upper levels of the tower know what I'm talking about) and about 300 plat for a rez.  <P>So, in closing Sony/Verant if you don't want to accept responsibility for the LD's that are ocouring with increased frequency, then please take the time and make the effort to change the code to allow us to have persistant hide/sneak.  And at a minimum.....if you are going to insist that you dont have the time required to make the code changes...change your "policies" to allow GM's to provide assistance to people like me who have suffered from a technical problem rather than in-game incompetence.  This means at a MINIMUM...and corpse summon if needed if not an out and out rez.  We pay you good money to play your game.  Why would you ever want to see us be frustrated in this way?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm going to say a few things and I personally don't care if I get flamed. Admittedly I am new to the rogue class at level 14, and have never had a character above level 40, let alone my rogue, but I feel I have a very good grasp on the situation as it stands. You are not giving Absor and the testing team enough credit. They no doubt have an incredibly talented test staff with people who love EQ and have state of the art equipment to test on. However, this may be the problem - the people who are testing it can only test on a computer that gives them incredibly low pings and the players know EXACTLY what they are doing. As a dedicated gamer, I tend to figure out the "right" way to do things VERY quickly. When I'm not the puller (I want to smack group members who tell the rogue to pull) the mob is hitting the warrior 85% of the time, and only hits me right after a backstab and right before an evade. Why? Because I have a very fast connection, I'm careful, and I time EVERY evade perfectly. The only time i take a beating is when my evade fails altogether - I rarely flub one. A talented gamer who is testing evade on a lightning fast connection could easily perceive evade is being "too good", but in reality it rewards people with excellent timing. I have played an enchanter to level 34, and it is a similar situation - an enchanter with good timing and a fast connection is at least twice as effective as one who has poorer timing and a dialup connection. This doesnt mean enchanters should be nerfed, it just rewards people with better equipment and better reflexes! This has been the case with every first person shooter game ever made, and it's no different in Everquest. I would assume that once I get my dual wield maxed, and my double attack maxed, this timing will not only be important, it will be critical. And with a nerf of the proportions Absor is suggesting, I will simply have to wait two evade cycles before trying another backstab unless I really enjoy the feeling of a mob beating me into a pulp and having my cleric whine about being oom after every fight. If the size of the hate list has changed, fine. Make evade drop us down to the point in the hate list where it used to end, and it will be exactly as functional as it is now, it won't be a perceptible nerf, it will merely reflect the changes that you made to the length of the hate list. I beg you to consider my argument Absor.<P>Gygaxinor<BR>14 Rogue of Bristlebane<BR>Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok Look, nearly every-single person to ever play a rogue knows this is a class killing idea... If you touch evade, we die. We can't take damage and the ONLY way to avoid getting pummeled is to evade, without it we become another mindless melee class who dies much more often.<P>Also I think there should be a message when you fail at pickpocketing. I don't use it but when I group with a rogue who does I notice the ammount of loot drops significantly. We may be rogues but as been stated before the difference is we are not thieves. If they're good enough to suceed there should be no warning or message but as soon as they fail I'd really like to see "%T screams hands out of my pockets thief", or something to that effect in big bold yellow letters or something.<P>I'd also like to see stackable poison</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1. Evade: Do what you have to do. <P>2. Stackable poisens: I posted a wishlist item but I will repost here again. Absor said that it would be a lot of coding to make them stackable. I would agree, in one sense. However, I don't want to make them stackable, I would like to see them Multi-Charge. Kind of like the Shaman Potion deal. Give us a poisen bag that will combine single dose/charge poisens into 10 shot deals. Currenly, I take all my poisen components, vials, suspensions, and Mortar and Pestle WITH me when I go to fight. Because I don't have enough room to make the amount of poisen I need. At least the components are stackable. Does this make sense, that poisen should be made in the field?<P>3. Masks: Especially because I'm a roleplayer. My guild wants a spy, but they ALWAYS choose a chanter over me because they can do it better. I've even had members tell me that a rogue is no good at reconnaisance. <P>4. Quests: We are horribly lacking in quests. Especially on the DE side, you have about 3 at really low levels, then nothing till redemption or epic. Not fun. <P>5. Tracking: The evil races have one severe problem. If I am correct, they have no ability to track. Like I said, I'm a role-player, and finding someone to help hunt down a mob is impossible. It would seem natural that this might be a rogue skill. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>sorry, Missed one, and maybe the MOST important.<P>6. Damage Report: This does not upset the balance, this does not make us more powerful. This merely makes the truth as obvious as you make it for other classes. We do HUGE damage, but everyone else is so involved with crits because they can see them. We are not effective without a party, that is for certain, but PLEASE give us the ability to SHOW our parties how effective we are. Like I said, it isn't going to make us more powerful or anything. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Two non-evade issues:<P>First, please make the rogue poison resist increase in levels like the warrior magic resist.  This should apply to the selected monk resist as well, as they are all pure melee classes.<P>This is a simple request, and being that MR is more valuable than PR, it should not be a problem with warriors.<P>The hybrids can have their inate resists as is, as they are not pure melee and have spells with boosts.<P>Second, if HIDE could break the target lock, it would be helpful in PvP.  I do not play on a red server, but I'm sure that those who do would say this would help balance rogues more fairly with casters.<P>Quisp<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056582-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056582.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056582-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056582-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056582-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056582-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056582&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=056582&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
