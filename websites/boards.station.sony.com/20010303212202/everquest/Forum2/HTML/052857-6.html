</FONT><HR>Actually after thinking about my last post, let me point out something.<P>As a level 60 warrior, are you unaware of the SHORT list of things in the world that CANNOT kill me in under 30 seconds?<P>I honestly think this is silly now that I've really thought about it.  30 seconds to do 4k damage (me in full cobalt and full buffs) is on average 133 damage per second.<P>Only level 60 clerics are going to get this item, so please tell me absor, what is it in the world of everquest you possibly think is worth killing for two level 60's who have trakanon loots... that doesnt do 133 damage per second?<P>In addition, the breastplate isnt even used until the cleric is out of mana. Most level 60 clerics can squeeze out.. 6? complete heals, without meditating.  Before the breastplate is even considered, in most encounters, spending your mana FIRST is always the best option.<P>Honestly, I believe this nerf is unwarranted and silly, and if you present the argument I've just made to the people making the decision I sincerely believe they'll realize that nerfing this item is NOT worth the large amount of negative PR surrounding it.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I for one, do not feel like doing more testing for you while you figure out how to readjust the mobs like I went through during the last two months. I've already had to put up with you tuning Dain, Tormax, Yelinak, Velk, TV, and DN.

</FONT><HR>I’m sorry but the way Verant handles items in this game is pathetic. Let me pose a question. Why do we have a test server? Isn’t this the exact thing you should have tested before Kunark came out? Oh yea I forgot you treat your test server players like dirt. I know a few people who left test because they were sick of being neglected. Here’s an example, the bard songs with instruments bug not too long ago, people /bug'ed it on test, what came of it, it went live and had to be fixed after. Why don’t you use your test server for its purpose, to test things and stop neglecting them, they have valuable stuff to tell you about bugs and balancing.<BR>I will end my rants here but just so u know atleast 1 cleric from my guild is quitting because he is sick of the way your company handles it clientele. Changing an item we have come to use and find useful is just wrong. Can you please put light healing on the cleric BP, cant be worse then what you're doing now.<P>Soddan<BR>Prexus<P>(I cant wait to see how many people dump this game in search of better waters for newer and better run games)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Are you sure you have thought this thru...<P>A group of 1 warrior, 3 clerics, 1 enchanter and bard can still kill any monster. <P>As long as the warrior can be kept alive via BP CHs and cleric cast CH for 7.5 mins.  With 3 clerics only 2.5 mins. If they cast a CH themselves once each during this time 1.125 mins. With C2 and bard song they should be able to cast 2 CHs and still maintain mana over the time period, so only 37 secs....<P>Details may be slightly out but concept is the same. Uber guilds will be able to mount such a group easily.<P>Gte rid of CH and make it Superior Heal. <P>As for taking 6 months and 300000 people, that is a fallacy. It would have depended on the number of Donals BPs that dropped, and then amongst those people the lesser number that are smart enough to work out these exploits. <P>It is a broken item, take it out now.<P>Improve your QA!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hothgar,I was trying to be polite.<BR> <BR>Cheal is the problem. The BP is just an example of that problem.<BR> <BR>Cheal is why you can't tank anymore,even though you're the top of our profession. Because mobs are tuned to deal with Chealing by hitting so hard and so fast anything short of a warrior is DOA beforehand.<BR> <BR>This spell is unbalancing. Troller is right on the money here. But Donal's BP not only brings this into the light,it also gives us an innovative solution. Rather than eliminate CH completely,with the un-overwritable or dispellable "buff" Cheal,you can't chain Cheal. So it's now changed from a steady stream of Cheal to one every 7.5 minutes. Frankly,I think even every 15 would work better.<BR> <BR>Once this happens,Verant can retune the mobs to match the reduced healing output by dropping the amount of damage dealt. Which means thou and I can tank again at 50+. Which means druids and shamans can keep up with things as backup healers. Which means our lifetaps are more effective. Which means  everyone benefits.<BR> <BR>Which means clerics get to do more than click their BP and heal and med with the odd rez thrown in.<BR> <BR>This is bad?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A typical SoV boss encounter:<BR>(1) The overpowered RoK wizard is rendered useless.<BR>(2) Hybreds remain useless.<BR>(3) A few lvl 58-60 warriors tank an_uber_SoV_mob_01 mob while clerics double or triple up on the CH's.<BR>(4) Pet classes cast and recast pets as needed<BR>(5) Rogues and monks use riposte disp if they are aggoed and are rezzed with a cleric epic weapon when they die ready to grab weapons and haste items, be hasted by enchanter epic weapon, and return to the fight to repeat the process.<P>All this depends on keeping the fully buffed high leveled warrior(s) alive as they are the only ones who can survive for any amount of time.<P>Thus it make's sense to me, and I agree, that the Donal's BP is overpowered.<P>What doesn't make sense to me is VI's "vision" of a SoV uber-encounter.  An encounter where every class except warrior is mana-ineffient to heal.  An encounter where the "masters of direct damage" can empty their bar having erased only 2% of the mobs total HPs.  An encounter that relies on the cleric epic and the Donal's BP, not for convienence but for tactics.<P>How many people have been rezzed into a Trakanon fight? How many people have been CHed with Donal's BP during a fight with Gorenaire?  My guess would be -very- few.<P>The BP is overpowered because of the way you have advanced the game.<P>Side note:  The icon buff thing is stupid.  If you are going to nerf it, keep it a 30sec cast (I like the timing stratagy in that) with a 1min30sec recast.  That is 2min total of no CHs on anyone.  Even 5 clerics with a Donal's BP would need some  keen timing to keep a warrior alive against an_uber_SoV_mob_01, as if timed perfectly the warrior would be 20+ sec without a heal.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

If it takes 6 months for Verant to realise that an item of 'unlimited charges of complete heal' allows for an unlimited amount of healing, how long will it take them to go through and retune the mobs ? <P>How many patches ? How much downtime, screwed up loot tables, stuffed up quests, busted mobs that are level 60 and hit for 1 point of damage (See Plane of Mischief, and no, I'm not joking)<P>And more importantly, How much testing on all these retuning changes before they go live ? From the same Customer Service that brought us 'Spells are dropping' 'Portals are in the game' 'Alchemy works' 'Oops, Bardsongs are broken' ?<P>They just told us that they want to break the only working tactic in this part of the EQ game, and they have shown NO evidence that they will fix the game afterwards. In fact, they haven't even realised that their fix is the most devastating threat to their game yet.<P>And for it to come up immediatly AFTER all the classes have listed what's wrong, and after a thread that explains why these tactics have to be used because *NOTHING ELSE WORKS*, and begged them to do something about it suggests that someone needs to ship Verant a couple of hundred litres of Vision(tm)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Look no further than the other priest class bp effects to scratch your head and wonder. The druid bp casts chloroplast, not even regrowth - chloro can heal 1500hp over the course of 15 MINUTES. The shaman bp casts a self only ac buff with a small damageshield. It's even more useless. The cleric bp could originally heal 4000hp of a 5000hp warrior every twenty SECONDS. The paladin bp casts symbol of pinzarn. PINZARN! LOL. I could go on and on with the other class bp's too.<P>Not only is it unbalanced with regards to the other classes, it completely alters the landscape of tactics and strategy in raids.<P>I hope any clerics who quit over this change realize how childish they sound.<P>Verant has stated before in no uncertain terms that CHeal was NEVER meant to be a battle heal but a downtime heal. The fact that it turned into a battle heal anyway and required tuning the world immensely, in a way that hurt most classes, was a tragedy. The fact that clerics could acquire an item to cast CHeal in battle without end just exacerbated the problem to a whole new level - something of Monty Haul proportions that's just madness.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

If you nerf this anymore the pog will be far better, and a hell of a lot easier to get. Maybe you should increase the stats and make it the same effect as the pog bp.

</FONT><HR>The important thing with Donals Breastplate is to state what the original intent the breastplate was suppose to fulfill.  If that intent is/was unbalancing, then don't go and try to concoct another method/type of (healing) spell to replace the effect.  That is completely unnecessary and unwarranted.  <P>CASE 1)  If the effect is unbalancing because the original intent was unbalancing, then change what it does... period.  Do go making up ways to curve the useage because it doesn't fit with how it was intended to work and players are taking advantage of the inherant weakness behind how it was created.  Find another existing way to make the original intent work.  Not a new spell/effect; that's definitely not needed.<P>The way I see the breastplate, it was intended to reduce downtime post combat (or even before combat).  Downtime for a cleric has always been mana limitation (as with any casting class in certain circumstances) and clerics are the MOST self mana limited pure-casting class in the game.  They are the only class without some form of minor mana recovery ability.  It's not and never has been a HP down time, it's always been a mana downtime; it takes mana to heal (and is should always take mana to heal at the level of CH).  Let me repeat, it's not a hit point down time, it's mana downtime as it takes mana to heal.  And Donal's BP doesn't have that limitation, that's breaking the game.  So perhaps the cleric is OoM at the end of combat and the tank(s) needs a heal, click the BP for a CH patch up so that mana downtime is reduced... wrong, that's not how it's working out and it won't ever be that way.  The largest downtime for a cleric post 50 is not from healing, it's from buffing.  Anyone that plays a cleric post 50 knows that after buffing a party, expect a long downtime to regain all the mana lost.  My suggestion for Donal's BP, in its intent to reduce downtime, is to make the effect one of the frequently used high mana cost buffs;  Shield of Words, Aegis, Bulwark of Faith, Aegolism, Symbol of Marzin.  In the end, what this does is allow a cleric to recover a party(s) quicker after a catastrophic wipe-out.  We have reviviscence on our epic (improves down time tremendously post wipeout) that saves a tremendous amount of CR downtime.  Put a high mana cost buff on the breastplate, to facilitate recovery after wipeouts even further.<P>Make it Aegolism and make Aegolism not able to overwrite itself.  Why Aegolish?  It has a built in limitation factor, it uses a reagent.  It is not as good as fully buffing with Heroism, Aegis and Symbol of Marzin.  Don't allow Aegolism to overwrite itself, so that it can't be used as a heal.  Aegolism is just right, it does a complete buff (but not a good as fully buffing with all stackable buffs), it uses a reagent (can even make it a more expensive reagent) and it can be made so that it doesn't cast over itself.<P>CASE 2) It could also be argued that the breastplate is intended to be a heal when things get rough and mana is low.  There shouldn't be any item that casts heals at the level of CH in the game at all.  Again, there shouldn't be ANY item that does a CH in the game at all.  This goes all the way back to why there aren't any healing potions in the game as well.  Items like that take away from the inherant initial class balacing made originally in beta and take away from the base usefulness found in the basic abilities that have been long defined for every class (in this case a cleric, and secondarily the other priest classes... druids and shamans).<P>Items that cast heals that are over 500 to 750 hps don't belong on click use items, items like that break game balancing that was already done.  That's the problem with Donals, as it breaks the original balance mold established so long ago.  After all, we don't have healing potions either, essentially the Donals BP is something like a healing potion... a heal with no consequence to control how often it can be used.  It will always be a heal without a method of moderation, the 7.5 minute limitation is not a good moderator.<P>CASE 3)  Another point, from another angle, the problem isn't how often CH is able to be cast from the Donal's Breastplate.  That's how the problem is being addressed time and again... 20 second cast time, 30 second cast time, now an upcoming 7.5 minute recast time on someone.  It's not the cast time that is the problem, it's the effect and the effect alone: Complete Heal.<P>In summary.  Look at the original intent for how the BP was to operate (what it was to accomplish in the first place) and look at the meta-game.  I believe the real intent is to reduce downtime.  Downtime reduction can be accomplished in another way for clerics, besides allowing a click effect heal.  A buff that takes a lot of mana, make it a good/decent buff that will be used, that can be cast from the breastplate is ideal for downtime reduction.  It's commendable to stick to CH effect on the BP, but it is really the wrong way to go.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Already stated a hundred times but I will add my 2 cents.  You nerfed the casting time once already should have been obvious then what the problem was.  Tune Yelinak, Dain, Velketor, etc. down to your typical dragon encounter (where donnal bp's are generally never used) and you will get a lot less arguement to change the bp.  Never say never but it would be a major undertaking to kill one of these guys without a BP as it stands right now aside from chain rezzing tanks (which of course would get the epic nerfed).<P>SOV=Warrior and a cleric world.

The donal's bp is so powerful, even in 30 second form, that against encounters balanced against the bp, a group that doesn't have the bp can *not* expect to be successful. The bp sets the minimum standard far too high.<P>Having said that, I still wish to state to Verant that I disagree completely with the notion of tuning encounters to the best of everything, because it leaves many many classes and every single non-specialized class and hybrid completely in the dust.<P>Either the encounters need to be redesigned to target the playerbase at large, or all the non-specialist and hybrid classes need to be given power very very close to the power of the totally specialized classes.<P>The current encounter balancing scheme sets a hurdle most classes simply cannot handle.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor said: "If the recast time was 7.5 minutes, the cleric would only be able to use it once in that time. With this change the cleric can heal his entire party (of six) completely in three minutes without using mana."<P>Right, which would put closer to the usefulness of the other breastplate effects (read: minimal but still nice). The others have essentially a 30sec 100pt heal. Nice, but nothing close to being useful in combat. Maybe clerics deserve something more useful, but nothing like a CH on a breastplate. Recast delays at least address the problem of it being used to circumvent downtime etc.<P>ABsor said: "It makes a huge difference. It's called mana. The breastplate is not limited by anything right now but it's 30 second cast time. The cleric is limited by his mana pool."<P>Actually, my point was that good warriors last quite awhile in sebilis and similar zones given their fully buffed hps and ac. The cleric bp made it manaless, but using the spell + med times in between fights is almost just as efficient. The breastplate was a problem, of course.<P>Uberwolf_Unity said: "I honestly think this is silly now that I've really thought about it. 30 seconds to do 4k damage (me in full cobalt and<BR>full buffs) is on average 133 damage per second."<P>Think this was targeted at cleric with the bp abusing the effect as described in the original post. Its usefulness to freely CH during a fight is null for raiding, but very obvious for xp groups.<P>Absor said: No matter how necessary the 'nerf', there is always an outcry from a vocal group, and perhaps people here were a bit unwilling to anger customers."<P>Course it (nerfs) at least makes the game worthwhile. BTW, thanks for nerfing the mage uber-mana regen bug  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Alcheon of Prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'd like to bring up a couple of issues you guys hit on a few times...<P>Several of you stated the futily of some Velious encounters if the Clerics didn't have Donals BPs.  So, I ask, what percentage of guilds on your server have even a chance of getting a Donals BP?  Trakanon is a mob farmed by small rotations of the biggest guilds, even on the oldest and most established servers.<P>To point out the absolute necessity of this breastplate only serves to demonstrate how absolutely broken it is.<P>Look, I hate nerfs - but for the love of Bertoxxulous, all some of you have done is help show exactly how broken this breastplate is.<P>---<P>Q:  Is the fix perfect?<BR>A:  No.<P>Q:  Is the fix necessary?<BR>A:  YES<P>---<P>I do feel sorry for Clerics who have this item.  To have this drastic a change happen to them must suck...  ...but I don't feel sorry for the game as a whole.<P>Too many of you replied and helped Verant prove their case.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The BP itself is really a non-issue. In 30 seconds you can med up a brand new CH. The BP only becomes an issue against Velious mobs that have hundreds of thousands of HP where eventually your clerics will run out of mana no matter how efficient they are.<P>If Absor is convinced of the reasoning he puts forth to nerf the BP, the exact same reasoning must therefore apply to complete heal as a spell. C2+catana+liched necro feed = unlimited complete heals every 12.5 seconds. (You might not even need the necro.) This group is unkillable as long as the mob can't kill the warrior in 12.5 seconds. Add a second cleric, with reasonable timing, the mob has to kill the warrior in 7 seconds, or a third to cut it down to 5 seconds (rounding times up, with perfect timing the interval is even shorter). Enchanter can go home once he casts C2. This leaves us on the defensive end with a warrior, 3 clerics, a necro to feed, and a bard with cantana in a single group of six. The mob therefore cannot kill the players unless it is able to deal out over 5000hp every five seconds, or 1000hp/sec; and this is only a single group of six players. Add two more similar groups (still only 18 players) and the mob must now deal nearly 3000hp/sec (distributing damage via taunt is easy). Add regrowth to the warriors and it gets worse. Add defensive disciplines. Only up to 18 players right now. Add in a bunch of rogues to deal maximum damage.<P>This is why we have ubermobs that quad for 900, have hundreds of thousands of HP and regenerate incredibly fast. What's the use in this scenario for a druid, a shadowknight, a paladin, a ranger, a magician, or a wizard? None, considering the technical limitation of the number of players that can be in one place at one time without massive linkdeath.<P>Complete Heal must go.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If you're going to change the bp, please don't cripple the effect it has now. If it comes to that (and the proposed changes will definitely cripple it), replace the effect. You crippled Mark of Karn instead of replacing it with something new and balanced, and we all know how well that went over.<P>Put something we actually cast on the bp, like heroic bond, or something we'd love to have, like invis.<P>A 12 second Divine Light would be nice too, but then you'll have to nerf it because a warrior and a cleric could kill anything that can't do more than 900 damage in 12 seconds (not that they can't already).<P>While you're at it, maybe fix the drop rates on Donal's Armor (particularly the gauntlets), give us the group AC buff we've been asking for since kunark was released and fix our stun line (stuns, btw, are useless at high levels, thanks magic based spells!)?<P>Holden.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
