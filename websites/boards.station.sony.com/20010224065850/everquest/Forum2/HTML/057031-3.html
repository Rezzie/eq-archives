</FONT><HR>Starting over on the new, most recent server, the memories came flooding back. I see it filled with first timers, I hear the shouts of "To Orc Hill Lads-Take the Hill!, and I envy them for having the opportunity to relive that time that I just simply cannot recapture. <P>Sitting up on orc hill in wolfform- being awed by the new players-I feel like and old timer watching kids play-I feel old. <P>Anyway, I first did a high elf Pally, and can remember Being afraid to run beyond eye sight of the city for fear of being lost forever in the woods. <P>Then went to a wood elf ranger. The woods were dark and eerie, and loss of the city music struck terror into our hearts and a quick retreat to safety. <P>Upon First seeing an Orc legionnaire, I remember saying, "man, there are tougher ones then Centurions?". The first time we killed Crush and Dvinn (must have been 25 of us) there was a massive celebration. We went back out into Kelethin to shouts praise and Glory.<P>It was AWESOME back then, and it was exactly as the package said it would be. Wizards nuked to the heavens, rangers were tanks, druids were the gods of the outdoors.

</FONT><HR>I've been playing since early April of '99. Started on Bertoxx and stayed there til the /movelog last summer, when I moved to Terris-Thule.<P>My husband started playing the game first, played an Ogre Warrior. I wasn't much interest in the game but after watching him play for a week I decided to try it. Was too scared to start out "on my own" so I made an Ogre too, since the area was familar to me from watching the hubby.<P>I remember gawking the first time I saw a Troll, then gawking some more when I saw a Dark Elf - They were so TINY! <P>We wore leather til about level 12, then we met a Troll named Waylander who was running a business selling Banded. Paid 80pp for 2 pieces I think =)<P>Stayed in the Feerrott til level 15 or so, then we finally ventured to South Ro. Seemed like such a long way! The Dry Bones were terrifying, and the Derv rings we got were awesome! *grin*<P>Finally we braved the Oasis. Sand Giants everywhere! Very scarey, since no one then was big enough to even think of taking one down.<P>We met a Dark Elf who told us wonderous tales of his homeland and invited us to come hunt with him in Lavastorm. We made the stressful trip only to realize we couldn't hurt the critters there because we owned no magical weapons. Disappointed we made our way back to the Oasis, where 2 of us promptly got smooshed by Sand Giants.<P>We grew up a bit and our friend Waylander became the owner of the finest sword we ever saw - a Bone Bladed Claymore. He paid a fortune of 200pp for it. We were all quite jealous *grin*. One day we decided to go try to attain one for ourselves and went to Befallen. Oh, frightening place indeed! We never found our sword, as we got lost inside the awful place.<P>When I was level 23, Waylander gathered everyone in the Oasis to take down one of the fearsome Sand Giants. We were all excited and pondering what awesome loot the big ugly would have. With about 40 people, we took one down! We had a number of deaths and someone ninja'd the corpse (first Ninja loot on Bert!) but we were so proud of ourselves!<P>We slowly aquired pieces of bronze and made trips to Najena for our beloved orange plate.<P>We then travelled to Lake Rathe and made our fortunes selling Runed Totem Staves (before they were lore) and small bronze. Glorious days *smiles*<P>Finally though, the life of an Ogre was too much for me. I made a Wood Elf Druid in June of '99 and she became my main character for the next year and a half. I will always look back on those first days of EQ with fond memories though.<P>-Krysania Septemes<BR>57th Wood Elf Preserver<BR>-Krysin Septemes<BR>51st Dark Elf Reaver<BR>-Valkyrii Bel`Daran<BR>44th Dark Elf Cleric</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I started in May '99. Not beta...but long enough ago to remember many of the things yall have mentioned here. <P>I was absoultely STUNNED when I first logged on. I was giddy when I made my first communication with someone in Neriak (I remember my wife thought I'd gone mad). Couldnt find my way out of that dang place. <P>Having played no other game for more than a total of 30hours, after spending 50 hours in Nek forest killing skellies one by one to get to lvl 6 I headed to befallen (someone told me it was THE place for a necro to go). Seeing the sky for the first time in EC...I was giddy again. I even remember coming back in to the forest and trying to explain what it looked like to him. It was incredible.<P>I remember when as a DE we started a group to hunt in EC. When we got there and saw humans killing a bear...I felt unwelcome around them.<P>I didnt feel comfortable grouping with anyone other than a DE (hadnt ever seen a troll or Ogre). I thought they would play tricks on me. That seems so strange right now. I just took the whole thing pretty seriously.<P>What is SOW?<BR>10pp for a mino axe? I can barely eat!<BR>Who is THAT in the light blue robe?<BR>Was that a tree running by me?<BR>Look out! Kodiak! (generally spelled Kodoecdn in a frenzy)<BR>What is this place Lavastorm...sounds way to tough.<BR>Why is my pet hitting me?<BR>Why the hell is my name RED...noone elses is.<BR>Why does the skellie hit me... Im INVIS!<BR>Beholder maze was the scariest place I'd ever been.<P>Oh man. I cant beleive I've been around this game so long. Thinking back to that first day and how astonished I was...I suppose I know why.<P>First char: <BR>Axis, lvl 8 necro - died for the last time at the bottom of the well in Befallen.

</FONT><HR>Ahh, those were great times. Full of exploration, high adventure.<P>I was one of the lucky able to startup that very first day of commercial release. A High Elf Wizard, on Xegony I was.<P>I remember the first forays to what is now orc hill. I remember the first time we saw the wizard spires, and sat there and talked for a while. We figured there was some puzzle to learn. We gave up on it after an hour or so, having touched, jumped, and did all sorts of crazy things to get a reaction out of those things.<P>I remember the first couple forays into CB. Lost my body and all his possessions in the moat at the castle, no one was strong enough to fight to it.<P>I remember when a BBC was one of the best items to be had, when an RTS was widely considered 'the stuff'. I remember BIBS selling for 500p, and wondering how ^%$&^ did someone get that much cash.<P>I remember my first venture into EC, as a monk on the 4th day. Some poeple had begun to spread out a bit. I remember thinking that griffins would not attack newbies at all, and standing right under one for about 2 seconds before I was proven wrong.<P>I remember my first encounter with a dark elf. I had was exploring on my own, lvl 8 at the time. I found this canyon off to the side, and took it. Zoned into nektulos. I had NO idea this was the homeland of the dark elves, so I cautously crept along. Lo and behold I got the crap kicked outta me by a guard that I hadnt seen. I swear to this day he wasnt there before, he must have been hiding or something  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Never did find my body either.<P>I remember making patchwork, seling it for 2gp a peice, 4 for tunic. I remember my first magical weapon! A combine longsword. Man was I proud of that! I remember seeing a giant for the first time. WOW. I about dirtied myself when I heard that CRASH CRASH of his footsteps.<P>I remember watching druids run around all over the place in treeform. Funny sight. I remember seeing a treant for the dirst time. And I also remember a alot of poeple saying I was stoned when I told described them.<P>Those were the days.<P>EQ at its best, only lasted 2 months  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>Call me crazy, but to this day I do not look at spoiler sites when exploring a new area. I love the exploration, the discovery. I enjoy the journey, as much as the rewards, maybe more.<P>The EQ of today, is a far far cry from what it was. Back then, exploration and discovery were for the brave, the curious, and the average guy.<P>Nowadays, especially since the arrival of the expansions, exploration is suicide if your not 'uber'. Sad. The average guy, is at best, a second rate addition to a group in any new area. The game has gone from being a place of wonder, full of exploration and granduer to be discovered, to one of 'get item x, so you can go place y'. And even beyond that, to 'getting 20 players of x+ in lvl' and go get item x so you can either get item y or goto place z'.<P>EQ, was not EQ after 3 months.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>wow...this thread brings back a *lot* of good memories.<P>My 2nd character (first was a de rogue that i tried for all of 20 min  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ) was Xlarthen, a half-elf druid.<P>I remember when coming across Tovax or Varsoon was an extrememly *bad* thing  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">. <P>..when I first started hunting in west karana, using the 2nd tower as a rally/resting point and hearing shouts of "Bandit to t2!!" or worse, "Giant to t2!!". On the latter, I learned real quick that my little heal didn't help my friends much when faced with a HG and that the HG didn't like me much after that.<P>Also was quite shocked when, as I ran through the door in the tower thinking "whew, I'm safe, no way that giant could get in here" and then turned and saw the giant come right through the walls to turn me into pulp :O <P>...being level 5 and with my fantastic new spell, Camoflage, making it all the way to High Hold, only to get killed by a prisoner while a nearby guard stood and watched  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Of course, then I got to make the trip a 2nd time  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> which in those days seemed a very *long* way from Qeynos Hills  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>making the trip at level 13 to greater faydark from the hills. seeing for the first time kithicor and the commons, taking my first boat ride...wow<P>...buying a runed totem from a friend for the reduced price of 20plat  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>...fighting in Unrest one day when a GM comes in dressed like a god and bestows a last name to someone who just made 20th. I wish they still did that, I think it made everyone feel really special when they got their name that way.<P>...getting my first teleport spell at 19th and just porting around for awhile (and to Tox forest for the first time).<P>...oh yeah  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> and getting tree form after I got to Kelethin.
