&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Without putting too much thought in it, I can imagine this thread will draw a lot of heat - mostly from the melee classes who seem to think I'm "whining", well maybe I am. I've played the game since release, leveled a Cleric up to 60 and seen every zone sans the Plane of Mischief(and Crushbone, shut up!). That includes clearing Veeshan's Peak and Sleepers Tomb. With that in mind I think I have the right to express my opinion on all issues caster related.<P>During the original release, before the onset of expansions, there were no real boundaries[spells/abilities] that made Class A more valuable than Class B. Obviously Warriors always had more hit points than Wizards and Clerics could heal more than Shaman could, but nothing earth shattering. Anytime I formed a group for exp it was 'first available', I didn’t pick and chose except to say, "no, I don't want 5 wizards."<P>Then came the first expansion, the Ruins of Kunark, and the obvious onset of class discrimination and favoritism. It may sound like a cheap shot, but I have to say this expansion wasn’t very well thought out before release. It's overloaded with items/abilities that make Class A exponentially more valuable than Class B, C and D. Who in their right mind wouldn’t take a 55 Warrior, with all those neat disciplines including Defensive, over a 55(or even 60) Ranger or a Rogue, with double-backstab, over a Paladin? Kunark also brought with it something we thought we would never see - items allowing melee classes to cast spells. Casters were flat out told that they would never see Clarity on an item, that would take away the need for Enchanters in a group, but now we see items that can cast Shrink and Invisibility being wielded by Warriors…<P>Scars of Velious was an even bigger slap in the face to casting classes. Verant chose to raise the bar on encounter difficulty without giving so much as a thought to how players would be affected. Well, I shouldn’t say they gave zero thought - I mean, they did consider that we might use the Donal's BP as a means of assisting us in these epic fights. They considered it so much that they admittedly designed certain encounters with it in mind, then they get offended when we *gasp* actually use the BP(/boggle). One major thing they absolutely did NOT consider was the impact of removing the hit point cap on casters. Up until this expansion Casters could contribute a noticeable amount of damage to a fight with spells or the combination of pets/spells - not anymore. What's 600 damage, or even 6K(assuming every Lure hits for max, ha!) to an NPC with 200K hit points(3%). Compare that 6K damage to the amount done by a Rogue(30K+) or Warrior(15K+) and your jaw will drop. No amount of proper spell selection will ever compensate for a MOB having more hit points than the combined total of everyone in the zone and quad-hitting for 700 a shot.<P>There are also NPCs in Velious that border on being 100% Magic Resistant, ummm… What the hell are they thinking. One of my best friends in the game, Azakar(a 60 Necro), tried to give me his stuff last night in Sleepers Tomb because he's feeling worthless. Why you might say, because he's fed up with NPCs resisting all of his spells. We comically refer to him as Azparse now, since he just sends in his pet and feeds some mana while standing under the MOB to let the real damage dealers know how they did that fight.<P>Why should any class be reduced to bean-counter status? Are we going to see Rogue only drinking fountains and a law stating that all Wizards have to sit in the back of the bus? I feel like I'm seeing the onset of racism(classism?) in a video game. We aren't making this up, some classes do literally ZERO damage to some NPCs, what's the point of them even going?<P>I would like to touch on the issue of items once again, having already mentioned the casting items given to melee classes in Kunark. Every caster I know, myself included is sick of the way items are designed in this game. Obvious favoritism is being shown to certain classes(namely melee) at every turn while others are left to wallow in the same-as-you-have-always-been abyss. There are items in the game that increase the effectiveness of melee classes on a percentage basis. If you get a Cloak of Flames you swing 36% more than someone without one. If you wield a Lamentation(9/19) you swing about 30% more than someone with a Ykesha. Percentage increases everywhere, and every zone is packed with melee items… Lets look at casters. Name one item that makes me 30% more useful than someone else my level, I'm waiting(someone please say Donals BP!)? I may have something that gives me a few more hit points or a bit more mana, no percentage increases for me. There is no casting haste, nothing that lets me cast a complete-heal in 9 seconds instead of 10, why? As stated earlier, I've been to and cleared Veeshan's Peak and Sleepers Tomb. Guess what spells drop in those zones? The exact same spells that drop outside those zones on exponentially easier MOBs. Where is the risk/reward? Why aren't there rare no drop spells just like there are rare no drop items? It's almost as if there are two distinct forms of government ruling EQ. The Democratic side rules the melee and the Communist side ruling over the casters. Why am I not allowed to be more powerful, via a unique spell or two, than someone not willing to take the risks I deal with daily?<P>Abashi, Absor, Aradune and all the other A's I'm missing should totally give up on the concept of ever balancing classes. It's too little too late in my opinion. What's the point of balancing classes when the items they achieve and the MOBs they face continually unbalance them? If you are truly interesting in balance then you should look at the game as a whole and not just Class A can do this and Class B can't, that’s not going to solve anything.<P>Vendrix<BR>Da`Kor</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

No fire based spells, no cold based spells, no magic based spells. Nada. Melee only.<BR>Luckily we had a magician and not a wizard with us. So he just chain-cast pet after pet and sent it in with the other melee'ers. And we had a cleric to heal us when the pet died and the momma took a few swings at a melee. Fight went about 15 minutes (the monk's mend popped up twice) then she went down.<P>Everquest is slowly stumbling over it's design limitations.<BR>That's why we wont see any more levels if they are wise.<BR>The game design isn't made up for levels over 50.<BR>It is reaching to get on terms with 60 levels now.<BR>End of the line.

No exceptions.  This is our role.  To do damage.  Can we withstand being hit?  Not if the creature wants us dead...  Every other class can, so their damage should be scaled to reflect that.<P>Casters pay for their power with no hp and no ac, but verant forgot this and gave everything to the tanks.

</FONT><HR>I dunno if it's THAT bad.<P>At 51 I was with a group in Skyshrine over the last few days, that included 2 level 60s. We were fighting stuff that ranged from blue to red to me, and once mob was Tash'd I had no trouble landing Splurt or BoD on any of em. I even grabbed a staff that procs Tashani for me (and goes off every fight) for the times we don't have an enchanter.<P>I realize it's a far cry from Skyshrine to Sleeper's Tomb, but we were very VERY far in fighting real nasty Dar Brood, and our group was 3 casters, 2 melee and 1 cleric.  We cleaned UP.<P>It's all about adapting strategy.<P>I still feel that there are too many resistances to "bread and butter" spells, like the wizard's non-lure DDs and all enchanter magic-based DDs, but these things can be worked around.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>You know, I play a hybrid and I can't agree more with you.<P>I've seen my casting side steadily brought to uselessness, and if I weren't part melee I probably wouldn't bother trying anymore. I'm just hanging to the game by a thread now, that being the conclusion of the current class rebalancing.<P>I've seen wizards, enchanters, shamies drop their character and twink rogues or necros, instead of exploring, seeking out new challenges with their main character. I've seen my best friend, a lvl 60 necro, give up on her character after playing it from day 1 and powerlevel a monk. Just so she could get some fun back into the game.<P>I can understand the principle of "some" mobs being very resistant to magic. But with Velious, it's become the norm rather than the exception.<P>I would have liked to see some mobs pretty much immune to melee attacks, for example with insane numbers in Defense skills, so they would riposte, dodge, parry almost every swings thrown at them. Then you would need casters to bring those down.<P>Well, anything that brings variety, change of tactics, and mostly, FUN, into the game.<P>The only point where I disagree with you is about the impact of a mob's HPs on the caster's efficiency. There are now items in the game, robes mainly, that allow you to nuke without spending mana. What is questionable is that all the Velious ubermobs have such insane numbers of HPs, requiring those awfully rare items for a caster to be effective.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alot of people seem to be blaming the additon of levels for al lthe present problems, I would have to say that I disagree. The problem, at least IMHO is that they did not scale the classes. Consider this even if there was no lvl expansion, just the continued improvement of equipment for melees would we be facing the same problem? I think so, certienly it would not be as dramatic but it would be there none the less. <P>The fact of the matter is those that have the equipment that continues to increase are going to pass those that don't, eventually.<P>For casters to have maintained ground they would have needed constant upgrades to there spells, bigger, faster, more efficent spells just like melee's keep getting bigger, faster, and more efficent weapons, and armor.<P>Now having said that I do think they messed up in a major way with the expansion, where casters went up 10% and melees went up about 50% in those ten levels. Which certienly increased the rate at which the problem came to a head.<P>Just my humble opinion.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As near as I can tell, Klandicar, Zlandicar, Master of the Guard, the Progeniter, the Arbitar, and all the Warders are all 100% resistant to all damage based spells besides lures.<P>This means that druids and shamans can only heal, necromancers can only dump mana (at a crappy 37.5% ratio, made even worse by the fact that they can't demilich because they can't lifetap), and mages can do nothing.<P>Sure, mages and necromancers can use their pets but after equipping our melee with primals it is now common for one warrior to outdamage 2 necro pets and 1 mage pet (not epic pet, haven't been able to get the mage in our guild who has his epic to log on so I can parse it).  I fully agree that a warrior should be able to outdamage a pet (though I think 3 to 1 is a bit excessive) but since my only way of doing damage is via pets the net result is that pet casters do very little damage at uber encounters in velious.  Verant needs to allow offensive casters the ability to do damage to uber mobs.<P>Vendrix also hit the nail on the head with the other portion of his post.  Casters basically get no items which materially improve their character.  VP and Sleeper's both introduced much improved melee power but casters are barely improved.  Sorry, but +50 mana really doesn't do that much.  The 2H staff in sleeper's is a complete joke.  It doesn't even come close to an epic item + say, a runed ornate shield.  Even if it did have good stats, it would still be more or less crappy in comparison to what melee are getting.<P>Let me give an example of some items that would actually be good for casters (also, please don't nit pick the stats I put on these, I just made up stuff on the fly, the point is the effects, and again, these are just examples):<P>Cloak of Evocation, WIZ, 10AC, +8 INT, +50 MANA, Effect:  all evocation spells cost 10% less mana<P>Gloves of Divine Touch, CLR/DRU/SHM, 11AC, +10 WIS, +10 INT, +30 MANA, +30 HP, Effect:  all alteration spells cost 8% less mana and cast 5% faster<P>Chestplate of Divinity, CLR, 35AC, +20 WIS, +50 MANA, Effect:  all healing spells heal 20% more health<P>Crown of Pure Thoughts, all casters, 15AC, +15 WIS, +15 INT, +50 MANA, +50 HP, Effect:  7 mana per tick clarity that stacks with all other mana regen spells<P>Gloves of Fiery Impunity, WIZ, 10AC, +8 INT, +30 MANA, Effect:  all mobs save at -30% fire resistance to spells cast by the wearer of these gloves<P>Staff of Conjuration, MAG/NEC, +20 INT, +80 MANA, Effect:  all pets have 15% higher level  (save the crappy +1 level effect, those focus items are barely noticeable)<P>Note that all of those items improve casters by a percentage.  This is necessary in order to be balanced with melee, who also improve on a percentage basis.  Like Vendrix pointed out, this is KEY.  A great many of the ultra high level balance issues are because of some classes getting percentage increasing items and some not.  Ultra-hard spells to get would also be nice as well.<P>However, I have every confidence that rather than choose to make casters happy, they will instead leave casters unhappy and instead piss off all the melee by nerfing melee down to caster level of ability.<P>Azakar<BR>Da`Kor<BR>60th Necromancer<BR>Erollisi Marr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Good post. The worst part to all of this is that it has gotten too far. Melee classes are so over powered compared to casters I don't see how they can make the game fun again.<P>Does anyone think Verant is going to say: "Hey, you're all right. We have really messed up this game for a long time now, but we're going to fix it."<P>That won't happen.<P>Back in the days if you had low ac/hp you would make lots of damage so if you aggrod the mob you'd be in trouble and those AEs would eat you. This made sense to me at least. But now melees in general are doing more damage than casters and I can't for the love of God understand why they changed it.<P>Only thing you can do is to start a melee and try to have fun again. Or hang on to your caster, but don't expect things will get better. Verant won't implement %-spells of any sort. If they knew how to they would have done it already.<P>I Can't wait until something better comes out.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It's not just the epic mobs these days.  More and more, melees are outdamaging casters for more ordinary encounters.  I was involved in a raid to the royals area of Chardok recently.  Grouped with 5 other casters (59 cleric, 56 druid, 55 druid, 52 wizard, 54 druid, and my 57 necro) and we got a total of 8 kills during the entire 9 hour ordeal.  We were going up and down, killing the Prince, the Queen, and the King as often as they spawned.  We must have killed a couple hundred ordinary Sarnaks as well.  During that entire time, two caster groups got a total of 9 kills.  The two tank groups got all the other kills.  As Zrazzt mentioned, caster groups can no longer do the damage to outdamage melee groups and we certainly cannot take the damage that the melee classes are taking, so what's the real point of playing any caster other than a cleric or an enchanter?  I played my necromancer out of a sense of responsibility to help my friends and because we had no one else to feed mana/summon corpses, but next time we go I intend to bring my monk twink and station the necromancer at the zone or the royals safe hall.  We can do just as well without the DMF buff and the necro can summon everyone just as well from the zone or the safe hall if needed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>As a wizard, I also find it VERY odd that the only spells that scale upward from level 51 are the AoE spells.   There is NO improvement for wizards from level 51 through 55, and a very minor upgrade at 56 on DD spells.  AoE on the other hand, has it's best spell line(tears), doing far more damage than a DD spell if this line is cast on a single mob with no pets.  So yes, if you have an uber-mob that has zero magic resistance with no pets, a wizard could do 1800 damage for under 400 mana at level 52 and up.  Does this seem odd to you when the DD spells do only 648 damage at level 52?  It sure does to me.<P>I am a level 54 wizard at this point, and from what I've seen in Velious, if you choose to side with the dwarves and dragons, there are NO zones a single group can hunt in that give XP or loot.  Let's look at the zones:<P>Crystal Caverns:  Low green mobs, loot is poor by the standards of a level 50+.<P>Tower of Frozen Shadow: Low green to blue, very low number of good item drops.  Some are very nice, but very rare.<P>Velketor's Labyrinth: Even with two groups of 45+, the kobolds will probably wipe up the floor with any group 45+.  2 or 3 groups minimum are needed.<P>Kael Drakkal: The Giant city, greenies that drop poor loot, or blue and up mobs with 15000 hit points that do insane amounts of damage.<P>Wakening lands: Outdoor zone, large area, perhaps the only zone a single group can expect to get XP in without camping very low blues right at a zone line.<P>Cobalt Scar, except for the sirens, has all dragon faction mobs, or friendly mobs(for many players).  So fight sirens, or nothing in this zone.<P>Siren's Grotto:  Mobs that can wipe up the floor with any single group.<P>Now, if a wizard gets NO resists, then camping giants at the kael zone line can be done with a full group, but don't try to actually hunt in this zone beyond that point.  Maybe a level 55+ group can do better, but with resists, even the rain spells don't help too much.<P>So yes, I agree with Vendrix 100 percent.  Spells that don't scale upward, no caster buffs, no items that add to caster ability(focus items being the only exception).  It seems like the caster issues are mostly ignored as well.  The wizard thread has yet to see a single response to even slow down the posts in it's eleventh part.  Go figure, Absor has no understanding of the wizard class, and from the lack of posts, doesn't even seem to care.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>*sigh* yeah, I'm a 60 magician, and I have to admit: my pets damage output sucks.  The epic pet does 67 damage max.  So what? my earth pets do 62 dmg max and it's getting outdamaged 3x over by rogues, if not 4x.  The only reason the epic pet is better than my earth pet(and can solo an imp protector) is because, defensively, it has some pretty cool stuff.  IE a 60 dmg damage shield, 3800hp, and some good ac.  But those defensive abilities mean ZERO when I'm grouped, because my pet isnt tanking, it's just assisting the PC tank. (assuming I even have a pet up, they made them so hard to control...so risky to use...)  <P>So as far as damage output goes, as a mage we are severely limited in comparision to tanks.  <P><BR>Also, I'd just like to add that I've raided trakanon several times, as well as woushi.  I would say that of all the spells I have cast on these dragons, I've done a combined total of about 600 damage; the resists on these mobs are insane.  I mean, really, why give these uber mobs good resist? Why not give them LOW resistance and high AC?  <P>Heh so anyway, if you want to know how much damage a 60 mage can do if you dont count their pet...its just about zero.  A mages pet = a mages damage out put for the most part... and post 50, mages pets suck for damage output when compared to tanks.<P><BR>Obviously, all casters have the exact same feelings that I do about our ability to do damage, whether it be via spells like wizards or via pets like mages and necros.  <P>But guys, how can it be fixed? For instance, to make mages do more damage than rogues like they should, you would have to make their pets do the same damage as a rogue, or close to it, so that if you add in the feeble nukes we get we'd outdamage them, although just barely...<P>seems to late to me, which is why after the class talks are over I'm probably going to quite EQ.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>/bump<P>Absor flat out ignores these threads doesn't he?  I've seen similar threads pointing out this problem but they all seem to be on /ignore.  Absor, if you read these threads, but don't have a good answer, can you at least post saying:<P>(1)  you're aware of the problem but think things are working correctly<BR>(2)  you're aware of the problem but don't know what to do about it yet<BR>(3)  you're not aware of the problem, and this is news to you<P>Don't really need details, but would like to know if anyone is even listening.  This is rather frustrating.<P>BTW, does anyone know of a good log parser that can process third party hits and can also export its data to a text file?  I've tried EQParse, Feeklelog, EQ Log Parse, EverLog, and EQU but they seem to either not do third party hits or only output there data to a tree control or a GUI table that doesn't support cut and paste.<P>thanks,<BR>Azakar<BR>Da`Kor<BR>60th Necromancer<BR>Erollisi Marr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Damage shields are useless.  To make them useful, mages would have to be given 60 dmg damage shields like my uber pet has.  As it stands, I dont waste mana DSing the tanks I am with.  As for giving mana to the clerics...that's what necros do, but 1000000x better.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>/bump<P>Most casters are completely useless against these things, why super duper high resists and why not unhittable with weapons of any kind. More and more casters, all casters, become completely useless post 50. I'm not a wizard, but at level 60 a wizzy should be able to easily nuke for about 5k damage. Why can't they?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
