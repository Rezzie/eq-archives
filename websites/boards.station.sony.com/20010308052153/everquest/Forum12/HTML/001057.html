&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Consider my spell lineup at level 60, as a NEC with over 210 days played... not to mention however many days I accumulated in Beta.<BR>•Harmshield (Quivering Veil of Xarn would be used here in this slot, except it's night-time only.... and who wants to have to worry about typing /time constantly in a dungeon, to see if they can properly defend themselves? Not to mention, there is no Sunlight in dungeons.... What's the difference what position the sun is at in Norrath on the outside? Theoretically, we draw our powers from the Darkness...)<BR>•Dooming Darkness (Strange that the level 29 spell is the best to use at level 60... Unfortunately, the obscene cast times and huge mana cost of the higher level Darkness spells &gt;Consider that most NEC's are alteration specialized and this line is Conjuration based...make them impractical for a mana/health balancing Necromancer in most situations.)<BR>•Vexing Mordinia (Excellent line of spells, even after the downgrades made to them. They enable an adept Necromancer to balance his mana/health, and open doors for other utility actions, such as damage mitigation for pet/tanks, as well as offsetting health transfer damage. Note, this is the only DoT I mem at this level, in most situations. That is for several reasons.. 1 is that most DoT's are simply too slow working to be mana efficient and effective in most groups. Yes, it helps to load something with DoT's.... it will die faster. Thats a given.. But, not enough to make a difference against the smaller NPC's that a competent party with Tanks/Cleric will chew right through. I find the NEC is better served to use his Vexing line to empower other utilities that serve the group.. and at 495 mana per cast, it simply doesnt allow much leeway in mana to load up frogs with DoT's.)<BR>•Utility Slot (This usually contains spells such as Shadowbond, Mana conversion *grumbles*, or Augmentation of Death)<BR>•Screaming Terror/Invoke Fear (Pretty much self explanitory..... this varies based on the location of where I am hunting)<BR>•Deflux/Touch of Night (It's rare that Touch of Night gets memorized. 720 drain is nice, but the cast time just isn't usually worth it. Deflux provides quick health, and you can use it in rapid succession to drain 660 in about the same time it would take to drain 720 with Touch of Night, with about the same conversion rate. For this reason and others, many high level NEC's will prefer Deflux over the higher level Touch of Night.<BR>•Feign Death (Even with all the changes/nerfs to Feign Death, I still find it to be a staple of the class, and undeniably useful.)<BR>•Arch Lich/Utility <P>I listed those, just because I am tired of people imagining NEC's to be these massive damage dealers, who just load up targets with DoT's. In fact, that role has almost been eliminated from us at high level. Maybe if we had 16 spell slots, and DoT's worked 2x as fast, things would be a bit different.<P>-Some things to consider...<P>Comparing the Shadowknight vs. Necromancer<BR>(Keep in mind, that the Shadowknight is nearly as formidable a tank as their warrior counterparts... being able to easily surpass the supposed 1100 AC Soft cap, and buffed to 4k or so health, while hitting for close to 200's with their epic. Semi-Understandable, since they were described as being 3/4 melee, and 1/4 parent class at one point.)<P>But for now, we'll focus on the spellcasting alone..<P>Staple lifetap of the Parent class Necromancer, is 330 damage, 198 mana, and 3.0 second cast time.<BR>Alternate to this, would be Touch of Night<BR>720 Damage, 405 mana, 6.0 second cast time.<BR>Conversion rates of 0.6, and 0.5625 respectively.... lower being better in this example.<P>Staple lifetap of the 1/4 caster, 3/4 Melee Shadowknight, is..<BR>338 damage, 225 mana, 6.1 second cast time<BR>Conversion rate is 0.66... not much different from the parent class in efficiency.<P>Now, if they are described as 1/4 of the parent class... Shouldn't a level 60 Shadowknight be using level 16 spells max, and not our level 49?<P>I mentioned mana efficiency for spells, to highlight a couple things..<BR>1. There really isnt a considerable difference in power when you compare a level 49 Necromancer, and a level 60. Drains still take nearly as much mana to cast,.... so our overall offensive capabilities arent raised much at all. <BR>The cast time, is lowered from Drain Soul to Deflux, which helps our defensive abilities..... which is nice.. But, if we're comparing defensive ability.... I would much prefer having 1100 AC and 4k health, to 3 seconds less cast time on a drain.<P>•Pets.<P>I had the first level 59 Necromancer pet on my server (Emmisary of Thule). It was exciting... eye candy really, but had some neat things about it, that made it unique.<BR>It didn't require weapons to dual-wield.. And it *must* be a significant upgrade since it was so rare, right? Nope..<BR>In fact, shortly thereafter... I tested it against a level 49 Skeleton pet, and it proceeded to lose the battle. I was using the level 46 Spectre, which hits for a maximum damage of 55's, vs. a level 41 Skeleton, which also hits for a maximum of 55's. Further testing, showed me that this wasn't a fluke.... the pet was just simply not much of an upgrade at all. <BR>Some time later, the special ability of this pet (Not needing weapons to dual wield) was given to ALL pets that come from the level 39 summon or higher.) mm.... thanks for the eye candy.<P>Now, consider.. My level 59 Spectre pet was losing to a level 49 NEC pet.<BR>Shadowknights (1/4 caster) get the level 44 NEC pet, which is one notch below the level 49'th pet that was eating my Spectre for lunch.<P>I dont think I really need to re-state the comments made by so many others in this thread, that we, as the parent class being stuck with the lesser of the two Feign Death versions is an insult.<BR>Look at it in a Role-play sense.. (Remember back in Beta, when Verant pushed Everquest as being very RP friendly, and oriented? I do..)<BR>Could anyone tell me where the Necromancer stands head and shoulders above a Shadowknight in spellcasting?<P>We are.. <BR>True casters.... practitioners and masters of the dark arts, supposedly.<BR>Where do we spend our time training? <BR>A: Studying casting, learning to master death itself..... to not only become one with it, but to control it. Reading books on magics that deal with such.<P>They are..<BR>Unholy Knights. (The Everquest.com description is as follows) A blend of Warrior-like skills, and Necromantic studies.<BR>So, assuming that Everquest.com is a reliable source for an accurate class outline, when I am picking where I want to spend the next 210 days.... I would assume that this class spends their time training...by..<BR>Training in weaponry (I bet it takes a while to practice and master 1HS, 2HS, Bash, Slam, Piercing, Archery, etc, etc) and dabbling in the spellcasting of their pure caster counterparts... who spend so much time in their magic, that the use of most of these weapons would be completely foreign to them.<P>Anyway, the fact that a Shadowknight could master a magic that the pure caster cannot, seems ludicrous to me. <P>Some history..<P>I mentioned this in another post.... but since I saw Absor make another comment on this in the Shadowknight threads, I thought I would re-iterate it.<BR>Absor says "As I've told everyone else, Lures are for wizards."<BR>I don't know how long Absor has been with Verant, or has taken the time to understand the history of the Necromancer.... but in the beginning, WE were the only class with an unresistable spell. Lifetap.<BR>This was changed, as I mentioned in my previous post..... because groups of Necromancers were able to kill things that were very red to them. (Example: 18 level 16 Necromancers killing a Hill Giant in the Commonlands)<BR>Sometime after this was found to be happening, Lifetaps were changed to be able to be resisted.<BR>I suppose the logic of that makes sense, or did somewhat at the time.... even though it took away what many NEC's considered to be a defining ability of the class....the only unresistable spell lines in the game. I just thought it was a bit ironic that now that so many people have forgotten that bit of history, comments like "As I've told everyone else, Lures are for wizards." happen on a regular basis.<P>Would it hurt so much to allow high level drains to be unresistable? This keeps lower level groups from killing things that they shouldn't be, and allows the higher level NEC's to regain what many felt was a defining point to the class. <P>Does anyone else remember when Mage pets were gimpy compared to the Necromancer pet?<BR>They had no spellcasting, could not dual wield, and certainly were nowhere near the equal of ours.<BR>Now, Verant's logic, was that Mages are supposed to be the "Masters of Conjuration" and justified making their pets stronger than ours for this reason.<BR>Aren't we supposed to be the masters of Undead Conjuration? The Everquest.com site states that we studied and *perfected* the ability to raise Undead Minions. Whats the difference? They are Conjurers.... we are Undead Conjurers... <BR>Promoting Mage pets to equal was one thing...<BR>But when I now see the Mage pets able to kill 5 of my level 59 Spectres in a row, it's again, insulting.<BR>I don't think you've seen a lot of feedback on this for 2 reasons. 1 is that perhaps many NEC's don't remember early retail, and 2 is maybe that they haven't experiences the mage pets hitting for 70's and tanking Krup Knights, while their end game Spectre is being chewed to bits and hitting for a maximum of 57's.<P>Enough abstract.. some suggestions..<P>•Either remove the restrictions of night-only from spells, or at least take into account the darkness that comes with a dungeon, and let Night-Only spells work in them, regardless of time of day.<P>•Upgrade the level 59 Pet. It's sad to see the end game Necromancer pet, losing a head to head battle with the level 49 pet. Especially considering that it takes longer to earn the 10 levels past 49, than it does to get to 49 in the first place. More than anything, our pets are truely the definition of our class. Followed very closely by...<P>•Lifetaps. If anyone should get a "lure" it should be the Necromancers. This is what was in effect when the game opened, and what Verant let so many people believe was part of playing the class. <P>•Essence Emerald requiring spells. I think the previous posts cover Necromancers thoughts on these spells. <P>•DoT's. As I mentioned above.... DoT's are too slow to be practical in most situations.. For 400 Mana, 111 damage a tick isn't worth much at all, when you have even Shadowknights doubling for 190, 186 etc...<BR>Maybe on the bigger encounters, the slow DoT's would be more useful.. That is, if we were allowed to use them.<P>•Ignite Bones. Early on, this spell used to serve as a stun, as well as a Direct Damage. In fact, it stunned the target for the duration of skeleton form.<BR>Stun was removed from this spell and the justification given was that it was a "fix for a problem with movement related spells"<BR>(It used to cancel Darkness and snare, etc)<BR>But, this left us with just a simple eye-candy DD.<BR>With all the complaints about Skel form.... If you want a practical fix for this spell, add the stun back to it. Or, at least *a* stun. <P><BR>I know that the role of the Necromancer has changed quite a bit as Everquest has matured.. Most Nec's are unhappy with it, and simply wish to return back to what they felt was to be their role in the community.<BR>I know you may be saying "Well, it's not our fault if they misinterpreted what our intent was.."<BR>But, in fact, the Necromancer community was certainly never told that their vision of the class was so radically different from that of Verant....<BR>I do think there is something to be said about time invested under certain pretenses, dont you?<P>Cryonax Beltane<BR>Warlock, Fennin Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree with most of what you say.  However, I don't think that the SKs necessarily get our abilities at too powerful a level.  So a SK can<BR>get our 44 pet?  Good for them!  It's not their<BR>fault that our 53/56/59 pets aren't that big of<BR>an upgrade from 49 (or none at all, depending on how you use them).<P>I do find it laughable, however, that SKs are better at pretending to be dead than necromancers.  Come on--necromancers spend the vast majority of their time studying the dead!<P>I don't think all dots need to be fast-acting...one more would be enough.  Maybe an anti-splurt ("trulps"?) to prevent it from doing too much damage.<P>And I agree about the unresistable lifetaps.  I don't know why they put in the level limit.  So three groups of necromancers in their teens could kill a sand giant.  Big deal!  Six groups of melee and healer classes could do it also--and did, regularly, where I was playing.  Gathering three groups of necros was harder than gathering six groups of other players, the XP and loot still sucked for the time input, it was dangerous, and so on.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>He forgot to mention Sks get casting haste.  <P>They cast spells FASTER than their parent class.<P>Also the whole FD thing is a joke for so many reasons. <P>*Verant frowns on FD pulling yet htey give this spell to SKs for that reason alone.<BR>*Necromancers are the masters of dead/undead and that was the justification for FD in the first place.<BR>*Necros are the parent class<BR>*Necros CAN NOT TANK and yet SKs have a HUGE portion of the Necro spell line.  In fact such a large portion that Necros actually question the usefullness of them being the parent class.  It almost seems the opposite.<P>Lifetaps:<BR>These WERE the lures of the game till Verant invented Wizard lures.  Lifetaps have a MUCH worse mana to damage ratio and much less ability to output damage and yet all Verant can say is "This will NEVER happen."<P>200 000HP+ mobs.  Casters are VERY limited in what they can do in these fights with a limited manapool.  Take into account the extreme resists and wizards being the ONLY class to deal with this casters are left in the dust by melee classes.<P>You get the idea...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I strongly agree with the point behind your post, though I think you posted two bad examples to support it.<P>That 1/4 comparision meaning lvl 16 spells was apples and oranges.  If SKs were limited to lvl 16 spells, they would be much much less than 1/4 parent class casters.  I agree with your gist, but the suggestion was way too extreme.<P>Also, a level 44 pet might (might) be too high while necro post 50 pets are so weak, but remember, the difference between a  44 pet and a 49 pet is HUGE.<P>The necro 49 pet is the ice comet of the necro class, and the reason (along with liche) that levels 49-51 are the glory levels of the class!<P>(I know its just a downhill ride to disappointment after that though.)<P>I miss the days of a lvl 16 necro's lifetap actually sticking on an SG or HG, and there is now no longer any reason for that stupid cap or resistability...lifetap damage just isn't that great at high levels (VI just don't realize we want taps to power our liching and do some token damage...maybe they think we are gonna drain Trak to death?
