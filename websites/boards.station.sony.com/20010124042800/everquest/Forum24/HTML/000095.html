But after I kill someone , they usually call me a coward  and come back and fight naked and in groups , but pks get cursed at and degrated when they kill in groups? Anti pks do the same stuff , and worse , then what pks do....and they yell at pks for doing exactly what theydo.

</FONT><HR>I agree to an extent. I started a low lvl bard and raid nektulos as a "human" mind you. Well this is a very legit roleplay reason. Last night in my trek to nektulos I was corpse camped and killed repeatedly trying to get my stuff. Soon I attempted to just drag my corpse away, they followed me and killed me yet again. They didnt even think about the RP reason im attacking them, I was just another PK in their eyes and needed to be corpse camped till I logged. Yes anti pks have no place on a pvp server. Why some people play on rallos I will never know.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Although I agree I also have reservation on this.  If you just walked in and started killing then they would have no way of telling the difference of your actions from that of a PKer. You may try putting in some hot keys with text that you can push while attacking.  "I will get revenge on all "insert race/class" for killing my brother in cold blood."  <P>One thing I like to do is:<BR>When I get bit by a rabid bear I have a hot key that says :froths from the mouth Displayed as "Mushin froths fom the mouth" if some one comes close I attack and yell "make it stop" then is says "Mushin looks very ill" via another hot key. To my suprise I have had many people mistake me for a NPC or even a GM giving a new quest or event. <P>I have killed people this way and never had people retaliate because they knew I was Roleplaying.  I have even had groups of people come to try and save me by casting varrious spelss and giving me elixers.  I have also been killed in the process of this act and when I resurected I thanked them for "healing me" Don't be afraid to drop out of character to let them know that you are roleplaying... this will make your adventures go along way.  Most people will applaude you if you just let them know that you ARE Differnt from a PKer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>i really don't agree with anything you have said on this post ( except the roleplay thing, i agree with that ) i am basically anit PK, but i don't get groups to kill the attacker, i do it myself ( maybe that's why i never really kill anyone ) it's good to see someone acually roleplay ( i think that's why rallos was made ) oh well, maybe if enough anti PKs make these PKs realize what this server is supposed to be about, then it will acually be a mostly roleplaying server ( of course there will always be those 2 yr old kids who come on rallos ) i just hope something changes, i would not mind going from anti PK to roleplay( would be kinda fun acually ) see ya later people that was my 2pp worth :P<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I see no problem with anti-pk's.  It's like an excuse to PK as a good guy.  What I DON'T like is people that do it because "pk'ing is stupid!".  Well, if you have that mentality, then you are surely on the wrong server.  Pk'ing should be in roleplay.. about race, about class, and about the way you encounter the person.  The same goes for anti-pk.  Anti-PK is like the Robin Hoods of Rallos Zek, killing is bad, but it's to get back to those that are bad.<P>I have mostly anti-pk characters (they try to help those getting attacked, and will kill a witnessed pk'er to help the victim) but am right now building a gnome pk.  She works with more than one gnome because of "size disadvantage".  They swarm around the victim and harass them and taunt them about fighting.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  A Pk (Fragger) started to chase one of us, so we taunted him until he went away (he could only hit one of us, a 16 wiz).  Then we followed him invisible until he came to a woodelf and started attacking him.  So we immediately appeared and the 16 gnome started to bomb him with her huge bombs till he died.  The victim was anti-pk, but we acted nice to him (well we just saved him from a new enemy of our own).  He said he hated PKs and that he was anti-pk.  We told him we were PK and he said, "well, mean pk's!".  I gave him see invis and wished him luck and not to wear anything expensive.  I'd hate to have him fall at my hands in the future  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  Later that evening the Wizard was pk'ing and an anti-pk started DoT'ing her.  The woodelf we helped earlier ran up to our aide and started healing the wizard.  After he started healing her, the anti-pk that was DoTing healed her.

</FONT><HR>Get used to the idea of all that stuff happening.  the truth is that on a PvP item loot server like Rallos Zek EVERYONE gets pissed off at you for engaging in PvP and looting itmes.  Quite frankly I am sick of it.  The worst of it is the argument that these complainers give you.  they say that you are a "pk" and are not engaging in PvP.  Going by thier definition, there is no real PvP in Rallos, even by the "anit-pk's" that say it exists.  If being a "PK" is so bad, where are all of these PvP wars? Why is it that NO ONE hangs out in the arenas?  Why is it that I can sit in a zone forever typeing /ooc looking for duel and NVER get a response (except for the overbuffed naked person of course).  Dammit, they all log onto Rallos Zek, a PvP server and spend thier time LEVELING.  When people like me come along, looking for a duel, a PvP war, a "PK" experience (I really hate that word, the defieniton is COMEPLETLY subjective) what do they tell me? What do they do?  You would not even know that this was  supposed to be a red server.  So I engage in a little combat.  Like anyone else, I do it mostly of BOREDOM simply becasue I joined a PvP server where PvP is outlawed.  And for Christ's sake, dammit, if you are afriad of naked casters so damned much why havent you gotten any RESIST GEAR!!!???  You don't fight orcs without your armour do you?  Maybe you like to tank giants without you armour?  Beleive it or not, it does not take much to resist many spells, and you would be surprised how easy it is to make a naked caster go out of mana.  <P>I am TIRED of logging on to a LOOT PVP SERVER to see people whine and shout in ooc when I decide to fight.  You know what I tell them? I came to a PvP server to fight a bit, and if you don't like it GO CAMP SOMETHING!!!!!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I read several post and rarely respond.  But i notice a poster above, once again, mentioning Pks then following with remarks such as "d00d" and "phat lewt".  I dont know what your encounters have been with player killers but if you want to generalize a group of ppl, take a look in the mirror.  <P>Anti-PKS seem to think the game should revolve around thier views of what PvP is.  And that us player killers should move back to games like Quake and such(which i have never played). Assume that "kids" are player killers(and some are, but some are anti as well). Antis are no better if not worse than pkers.  They use tactics such as corpse camping, zone camping, high lvl buffers and healers.  You camp spawns that are way below your range for exp for the "Ph^t l@@t".  Your no better than the pks themselves. <P>Im sure there are a percent of player killers that are 13-17 yr old kids going around ganking with casters, but then thier is my guild, a group of adults who enjoy every aspect of pvp. We have no hangups, no rl issues, we work, we pay taxes, we have families. And yes we enjoy hearing you Antis voices crack whe you cry in shouts. See that is the real reward, not the "pHA+ l@@t".<P>I personally try to make the fight as fair as possible (target even or above, full health, not engaged in battle with npc). However there are some in my guild that just plain kill anything in thier paths.  We play a role in EQ, we play an evil role.  A role you would like seen killed off the server, not going to happen.  <P><BR>Who justifies what role playing is?  Verant should.  If Verant was interested in making RZ a roleplaying server then faction hits would need implemented.<P>Give us exp for killing ppl.  Implement a way for the one being attacked to gain the exp.  Believe me, we will work around it. Plus when you want your vengence you will be hesitant in getting it, knowing that more than likely the pk will win the fight.  Implement faction hits, most pks have two accounts and can easily get what they need and still supply thier main chars with items to sale back to you antis.<P><BR>Distinctly Anti...then your on the wrong server.<P>Wanna roleplay lights vs darks, move to Tallon or Vallon.<P>Want to engage in pvp when YOU want too, move to a blue server and duel.<P>Want to continue WHINING and running petitions that will do NO GOOD, then start yet another tread on coin loot and move logs.<P>my 2 copper.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> Lion, you dirty lil' bastard.  I was a pk, but now im off. I never ever heard a pk say phat loot or anything like that. I never said it. Do you people realise that Everquest can be cheated on RZ? all you do is get a character to 16, go to oasis and Faydwer and rape all of the twinks there. Its so simple, me and my friend got to 16 and we pked for 2 months and got better stuff than a level 40+. Why? because youve got to be dedicated, you have to make friends with the target then youve got to axe him, doest matter if hes getting attacked by an NPC do whatever possible. Than when youve got all your stuff. Make a paladin, arm him with the stuff you stole then sold and bought armor and good weapons and twink the hell out of your new paladin. Paladins are good 6+ because you get a good Heal touch and bash. 9 is even better because you get spells. Anyways, this game was conquered by 2 15 year olds. Everquest is mainly item based, so when you get all your neat new items, youve won this infinite game. Good luck to you pkers who travel in 2's and 1's, down with pking guilds (totally gay). pking guilds dont need skill at all or strategy. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It frustrates me that all these Anti-Pk's sterotype and generalized pk's to the point that i wonder if i am playing the same game with them.<P>first of all, you definitons of the pk and anti pk and pvp are wrong. to say that a pk is a zone camper, and a corspe camper is wrong.  a pk is a player killer. enough of that . pk is the gereral term used to describe anyone to engages in pvp combat.<P>dont give me that roleplay pvp stuff.  i rarely if ever see that on rallos zek, and never enough to think that most people actually engage in it.  when i log onto rallos, i almost never roleplay pvp - does that mean i am an evil pk? you would say it does.  you would think that since i dont roleplay i MUST BE camping corspes and beating on weak opponents strickly for loot.<P>Kepp it simple, folks, and stop changeing the definitons.  PvP is player vs. player.  PK is player killer.  GRIEF PLAYER is what you are taling about, the zone and corspe camper.  I don't  get along with many anti-pk's because they base their entire idealogy on sterotyping, bad definitons, isolated incedents, or the "renagade cop syndrome" where they justify that every "pk" must die just becuase they lost a newbie fight.<P>Gimme a break.  This is Rallos Zek (PvP) server.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Nice to see the aggressive pvpers of Rallos come together.  Even when i was in a guild that fended off player killers, chased them outa zones, i preached VS-Pk not anti.  To be part of Rallos Zek you can despise player killing and enjoy gaming.  You have to embrace the pvp.  If you wait around to be a victim its gonna happen.  The only way to beat us is to be as aggressive as us.<P>So whats your solution, well from my dealings last night. You tweak a char with no drop armor, planes weapons, and get pwrlvled by higher lvl chars.  Now is that roleplaying anymore than player killing is?  Can i not stereotype you all after that incident last night?<P>Yes it does suck to die and lose your gear.  But for the first time i played on a teams server and roleplayed my Darks vs lighties.  Must say dieing without losing loot was nice but strange.  But i knew i could keep going back with no fear of losing anything but time....there were no consequences for my attacks, basically you can spend all day pking and not lose anything but time, so there is no deterent to kill, kill, kill. <P>However when i started killing on a teams server all sudden i see shouts "&lt;name&gt; is a pk". I "/ooc *** is this not teams--darks vs lights?".  I get well its also a good vs evil!  Here we go someone else changing the view of what the server is.<P>Point being no matter what....you can count on someone judging what you do, but the ones judging, just like on this board are usually no better and as the title states WORSE.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> I agree, if you compare a game to RL its stupid. If you refer to something in RL thats fine. The thing i hate about anti-pkers is that they band together and fight, they go on and on about the pkers. They dont get into 3-6 man groups they are huge! 10 and over in Gfay and other largely populated zones, they prey on the pkers. They corpse camp and try to get items also (they preach about that crap yet they do it themselves). They try to loot as soon as you die to get whatever you are wearing. Now the ani-pkers band together but independant pking groups dont, the guild do though, that means that generally th epkers get their asses stomped. My friend and i pked by ourselves or together, never with anyone else besides maybe a healer once in a blue moon. Anyways we mainly did pk for fun, didnt matter who we got, was cool if they had neat stuff though  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">. Anyways it pisses me off to see people writing about kewl d00d lewt and shat. Hey guys lets do ANOTHER poll that will abosuletly NOT benefit the coin loot procedure!<P>    P.S. check out shadowbane.com going to be a badass game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum24&number=24&thisthread=000095&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum24&number=24&thisthread=000095&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
