&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
</FONT><HR>    Let me begin by stating that I think the ranger is by far the greatest and most rounded class in the game.  I have always had an affinity for the ranger in other games (AD&D, MERP, and others) and was pleased to find them in EQ.  Rangers in EQ are by far the best of the hybrids, and in my opinion, are better than most other classes in the game.  I would like to see some minor tweaks, but as it stands I am proud to play a ranger, and will likely only play other classes when I am truly bored, or just need a break from the higher level stresses.<P>     As the various classes get tweaked and tuned, I have noticed rangers get little attention.  As said before, I think rangers are the greatest class, being highly balanced, yet I see them lack a certain something that would define them from all other classes.  They are due for a tweak or two, in my opinion.  I propose some changes below, which may or may not be possible, but would be greatly appreciated I am sure by Rangers around Norrath, regardless of how minor a change.<P>     First, I would like to address skills, both Combat and non-combat.  Rangers are to be the great outdoorsmen, and masters of the bow.  They get some pretty nice bows, and the fact of Criticals is nice.  However, bows don't get much use given normal situations (usually one shot to a mob before it is too close).  I propose they get something that makes them show their mastery of the bow: give them point-blank range with it, or perhaps a delay modifier, or maybe a higher Critical chance.  I have seen Warriors also get Criticals with bows, so this really didn't set the ranger apart too much.  A point blank range, being the ability to fire up close and personal, is not unheard of.  AD&D allows it, albeit at a slow attack speed.  A modified delay, say a percentage of reduction per level (a level 50 ranger would have a 50% reduction for example), would allow the ranger to land a few extra shots on the mob before it closes to melee range.<P>     On a similar note, raising the cap for Fletching for rangers would be a nice touch, and would go far to encourage the ranger to actually work for that Trueshot rather than wait to buy it.<P>     I think the armor restrictions on rangers are fine the way they are, although other than the Etched Ivy armor, there really isn't much out there tuned for a ranger's use that gives decent AC (this also is with exception to Planes Gear).  Maybe a piece or two, nothing major, such as a mantle or mask would be nice.  Perhaps instead of AC points, there could be some armor that enhances both AGI and DEX.  Also on the armor note, but not necessarily related to rangers, I have read the Ask Milo column often, and seen many a complaint that too many pieces of armor look alike, as well as that varying the colors of a piece degrades the graphic quality some times.  Perhaps instead of more colors, you should toss a few new skins in there to differentiate armor types.<P>     Damage output could be a little higher, be it by better weapon selection (although what we have is great) or by upping our melee skills a bit, but not to that of rivaling a warrior.  Rangers were always primarily melee/archery fighters in lore, so a little extra output would be beneficial.  I don't quite understand why our magical skills cap out at 235, but our combat skills cap out at 200.  This is a bit off to me, as rangers spend much more time tanking than they do playing healer or nuker.  I would think it not unreasonable to either reverse these numbers, or perhaps even them out.  Rangers have less HP and AC than SK’s or Paladins, so the ability to do a bit more damage would not be too unreasonable I think.  Again, I think we have a good damage output as it is, just those numbers confuse me a bit.  In all my years I never saw where a ranger had been more spell oriented than warrior (in most RPGs they are listed as a warrior subclass).  I am grateful for Dual Wield AND Double Attack, as they excel us past the SK and Paladin.  Perhaps to make this skill cap change more feasible, you could lower the caps on other weapons skills, thus restricting rangers while enhancing them.  For example, lowering our caps in the Blunt, Piercing, and 2Handed skills by a great amount to give us say 20 extra points in 1H Slashing, Dual Wield, and Double Attack.  Perhaps another way to go would be more DEX boosting weapons or gear.<P>     Tracking needs some work.  I hate to track a mob from across the zone only to find it being killed when I get to it.  Perhaps they should be listed in order of proximity, and even a scrollable listing, which would allow for more mobs to be on the list.  Also, the ability to track corpses (by following the path of the recently deceased)(even just your own corpse) or tracking whatever you have targeted would be a plus.  If I walk into the woods, and I see a critter from a distance, I should be able to follow it.  Tracking your target would be really nice since occasionally mobs can get away from you, and you really can lose them (often wandering into an even nastier mob).  Another though would be to list mobs on tracking by level, albeit a vague range, but it would make things simpler.  I wouldn’t recommend being able to con them from the tracking list as some have suggested, but a general idea wouldn’t be bad (well, more general than the conning system, another aspect that could use some work).<P>Rangers do fall short in that they have no spell or skill that is unique to the class.  An interesting idea would be a “befriend animal” effect or skill.  Not really a charm per se, but something that let’s the rangers have an animal that is near by aid them in combat, or protect them in some manner.  As the skill increases the level of the animal, or perhaps the radius of effect, or some parameter, would increase.  This would be an interesting skill to see in the game, and as there are many zones without the benefit of wildlife, let alone high-level wildlife, so it would not be easily abused.<P>     My other concern is in the spells we are allotted.  I have very little to argue with current spell selection, I just think perhaps a few ideas for what we’d like to see in the future.  First off, I would lower SoW to 30, as it is really awful long to wait until 39 for it.  I would never go lower than that, but I think at 30 we have suffered without it far long enough.  Although I hear many cries for them, I would never give a ranger Gate or any other teleport-like spell.  Maybe as a charged effect on a weapon or piece of armor, but never as a spell.  Lowering the price of gate potions would be lovely too (in 39 levels I have never had more than 3000 pp, of course, I never really sell anything, and the Fletching Market was never very profitable).  <P>     .  I also hear cries for the ability to bind, but again I think that is for the casters and not rangers.  If anything, I would give them the ability to bind outdoors only (no cities or dungeons), but that could lend to abuse as well, and perhaps make them unbalanced.  I’m sure that could be further restricted in that they could only bind themselves.  Eyes like Cat s pretty useless, as is Dance of the Fireflies, to the elven/half-elven rangers (which comprise 2/3 of the ranger contingent on Norrath) as they are self-only.  At least Eyes like Cat should be castable on others, making it a viable buff.  <P>     I think our healing is balanced, we are not paladins or clerics, after all.  A Regeneration type of spell would not be far out of the question, however, and could be made self only for balance if need be.  Perhaps one of the lesser forms of the spell.  A Dex buff would be loved and adored for an eternity, as this does seem to affect our weapon procs and combat accuracy.  On the buffing note, an upgrade on Feet like Cat (the Agi booster) wouldn’t be a bad thought either.  I’m not saying replace FlC; I would merely give a new spell that has a greater effect (much akin to the Skin Like xxxx spell line).<P>     My other thoughts aren’t really in any single category, so they will be expressed as organized as possible.<P>     Quivers need a bit of fixing.  The first quiver I ever bought I did so thinking you could put it in the ammo slot.  When I saw you could not, it soon became pointless as more arrows could be carried in a pack than in a quiver.  Were this enabled, it would make them actually useful.  Perhaps make them a mob drop, or even a craftable item.  Either way, they really aren’t cost/space effective.<P>In the Ivy armor quests, some of the spawn times are ridiculously long.  I have known people to waste entire weeks just sitting in OoT waiting for Wiltin to spawn and the same with Maldyn in Rathe Mtn.  Some people can't afford to spend that amount of time on a game, and it is terribly boring while waiting.  I also think is was a bit rough to put the quests in the relatively quiet zone of Kithicor, then throw a slew of lvl 35+ mobs in there, that's just insane.  Nothing worse than putting a training point into Disarm and getting jumped by an Undead Cleric, and you have no SoW to even think of getting away with.<P>     My last point can apply just as well to druids as it can rangers.  There are no higher level zones, other than Kithicor, located in the great outdoors.  All the higher level dungeons are just that: underground dungeons.  This removes some of the usefulness of the druid and ranger, and limits their spells.  A few outdoor zones geared for the higher level characters would be great, and may actually help clear out some of the more congested zones.  Cazic Thule is a great combination zone, with indoor and outdoor areas, and I have noticed harmony doesn’t work inside the buildings there (which does disappoint me some, but I can live with that).  Kithicor is great other than the fact that it is all Undead, and a bit rough for the poor newbie halflings and level 20s on their way to HighKeep.  Some nice, high level, outdoor areas would be really grand, and probably quite welcome to many players.<P>In closing, I do believe that rangers are the greatest, and I really can’t see myself playing any other class (at least not with any kind of regularity).  I just simply propose some minor tweaks to refine and define us a little more.  I’ll never quit EQ for lack of these changes, but I think they are probably the more reasonable changes to make.<P>Please respond with any comments to both the board and my email nytcrie@lenzlink.net.<P>--The NytCrie<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Drat, you beat me to it.  A well thought out message regarding rangers.  Thank you Nytcrie.  Although i would personally suggest the proximity route on tracking.  To say tracking works as it should is in my opinion either 1) an odd expectation or 2) not understanding what higher lvl rangers are dealing with when tracking.  My skill is 200 in tracking.  I can track a tree snake clear across the zone with no trouble.  However i am unable to see the mob directly in front of me.  Personally i would prefer named mobs and mobs close in proximity to my lvl to show first on the list.  i have however found a trick to fixing tracking when i keep getting the same mobs over and over popping up on me.  I log and when i come back it is usually "fixed" with mobs closer in lvl to me for  the first couple times i use track again.  Then resumes picking up the low mobs.  Not sure why this happens.  <P>Walksinshadow<BR>46 Seasons on Rallos<P>ps: BUMP!!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Let me start by saying leave my Ranger alone! (for the most part <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">) Most of the sugestions made by nytcrie would unbalance the classes.<P>Rangers do _not_ need a class identifing trate. Our balance and versitility IS what identifies us. And fellow Rangers, please stop calling us "Masters of the Bow", or insisting that we should be. Why should we be? Becasue it's part of the class crest on the interface's screen? Rangers use bows because they are hunters. It's a roleplay choice, not a class mandate. One shot on a MOB? Level 39th?? No offense, but at that level you should know your character better (too much twinking perhaps...kidding). Root? Snare? Walk backwards? Ever try any of that? I went from lvl 15 to 20, soloing and using a bow to take the MOBs to below 1/2hp before allowing them to close to melee range. Point-blank range is a waste of an arrow. It's not realistic. When compairing to other RPG's remember this, EQ allows you to use a shield and a bow. The graphics drop the shield, but look at you AC stat, no change after firing an arrow. And you don't have to spend any time changing from ranged to melee weapons. Lowering delay for Rangers = unbalancing the classes. The other fighter types would deserve a 'primary weapon type' delay advantage too.<P>Boost Fletching cap for Rangers. Boost Jewler cap for Enchanters... Any Ranger who buys a Trueshot should be striped of their Ranger-hood. IMHO it should be "no drop". And who will make them for you if everyone thinks like you? I made mine with a fletching of 102 (took about 60 tries...lots 'o clockworks died for that.) Fletch because it fits the role you choose to play, or because you can make arrows with better range at the same cost of them lousy merchant ones, or because you want the satisfaction of using a bow/arrow combo you made yourself. Don't do it to make a profit (you won't), or to easly make that super-bow.<P>Armor. Each class has various things that they gain as they level, new skills, new spells/songs, etc. Something to look forward to besides raising HP, Manna, and current skill max's. What do Warriors get?<BR>New/better toys are their insentive. An increase in the selection of 'armor' (robes included) for all classes would be a more balanced suggestion. Same stats, just a wider varity of looks.<P>Please, please, please do not reduce other melee skills to rais the 1h slash cap!!!! I personally dig my Dragon Dirk. Double Yak's is sooooo over done. Show some character! Power players go for the 'best' of everything. They will argue for pages of posts on weather a 14dmg, 30del is better than a 16dmg, 33del. Who cares!! So you do 0.002 more dmg per second. Roleplaying is more fun. Power player's do nothing but complain how their class isn't the best at some such ability they think thye should be, how hard it is to get the best equipment, all the MOB's droping the best stuff are over-camped, or have too long a spawn time. What about style? Finess? Use a sword and dagger because it looks cool to you. Carry a mace because you like the idea of a MOB's skull crunching as you deliver a killing blow. Show you have character and depth, not a good calculator.<P>The suggestions on Tracking are mostly good. Tracking _needs_ a scrollable list. It should be considered a game interface bug in it's current state. This change is in no way a balance issue.<BR>It would be 'nice' to have a color coded range indication. Forget a MOB lvl indicator. How can you tell how tough a MOB is by looking at it's spoor? Identifying the type of MOB is good enough. Please, no corpse tracking. Bards and Necros don't need that taken away from them. A "current target" entry in the tracking list would be a nice addition, but do not allow a Ranger to target a MOB via tracking.<P>This post is too long now, so just quick comments on the rest.<P>Some Rangers are human so keep Dance', and Cat eyes. Dance' is good for keeping your conjure skill up to lvl max until something better comes along that uses that skill.<P>SOW. Adjust the level we get it to match that of the Druid progression. If it's in their 3rd rank of spells, it should be in ours too.  If that means we get it at 30th, 39th, 49th, or 9th, so be it.<P>Quivers are one of the biggest jokes that a Ranger faces. You are soo right on that one. I might consider one if it changed my looks too.<P>More zones are always good. Indoor or outdoor.<P>Game balance considerations include every class. Any change has to be looked at with a wider perspective. Even minor tweaks can take an ability or identity from another class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>justaguy9999999,<P>I am not sure if what nytcrie meant to say "raise the flethcing cap" or "raise our fletching advancement."<P>It used to be that rangers flethced one arrow at a time, and NOT the current 5 at a time that we do now.  The good part of that, is we have less downtime while fletching.  The bad part is that it now takes 5 times as long to advance the fletching skill.<BR>The Trueshot Bow was never adjusted to reflect this change, so it is in effect, 5 times harder to fletch than it was before.<BR>I think that is why they say that it is just cheaper to buy one.  You even said it took you about 60 tries to make one.  The clockworks don't even give experience by the time you raise your skill high enough to "really" attempt the Trueshot.<P>I don't know if that is what nytcrie meant or not...  <P>-Darkspawn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>It's good to hear some people discuss our class in a intelligent, reasonable way.  All I can add is a selfless bump  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> , and to suggest that our experience penalty be very carefully evaluated.  If we're suffering even half the penalty that it is claimed we are, it's a very serious balance issue.  Claiming that some classes (mage, necro) are better soloists by design is very valid, and I think it's a great idea.  However, to make the classes without this ability pay for it in the form of an XP penalty seems backwards.  Wouldn't it make more sense to penalize those classes considered more soloable?  That seems like it would encourage grouping classes, while still retaining the option of soloing.  When I hear that the high level population of newer servers is incredibly caster heavy, I imagine that this is why.  Not only are they easier to solo, but they gain more XP for it.<P>Nuvan Wijesinghe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I too am a great fan of the Ranger profession. Do I think it is the "best"? It is for me, but I suspect it is a matter of style. I've gotten to lvl 26 faster than I did a druid to 19. And I just have more fun slicing my enemies..<BR>Many people judge a class on how well it does solo. Those people are missing a great aspect of the game - I am in a GREAT guild and have several who I group with often. Yes, it is unfair for someone who is limited to just a few hours a day (I'll do a 14 hour session on weekends. I know, I have no life!).<P>I am amazed that we have Feet Like Cat since it is not a Druid spell. It is nice to have something to cast on druids in exchange for damage shields and Spirit of Wolf.<P>justaguy9999999, I've made enough failed attempts at the Trueshot. Yes, I could wait for lower lvl folk to kill the Clockworks and ask to loot, but so much wait. It is not a measure of how good a Ranger you are, but of Fletching. I worked my skill up to 130 and have still failed. So I bought one. This means THAT person can have the pleasure of trying again. And I will try again, at some point.<P>Verdan Greanleef<BR>Faithful Swordsman for Tunare<BR>&gt;Prexus&lt;<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I have to agree with the tracking being broken.  Not much I can say here that hasn't been said, but on spells, I have a little bit to say.  The problem with Rangers and Druids right now is there's so little differentiation.  A Ranger is just Druid with the ability to wear a bit better armor and no weapon restrictions, decent melee skills, and weaker casting abilities.  Or said in the opposite direction, a Druid is just a Ranger with weapon and armor restrictions, but better spells.<P>If a Ranger and a Druid group, the Ranger's spells basically become useless.  The only unique spell a Ranger has is the feet like cat.  It'd be nice if the 2 classes were differentiated a bit more in the spells.  I'm not saying the Ranger should have completely different spells from those of the Druid, but that there should be a few here and there.  Right now the 2 classes don't really compliment each other very well, and with the Druid's tracking being superior in most cases to the Rangers (due to a lower cap, thus they don't fill up their tracking list as easy and they find closer creatures) the Ranger doesn't offer as much as it could or should.<P>For the most part I think the Ranger class is in good shape, but the spell selection could definitely use a little work and with the Kunark and the higher level cap about to occur, it would be the perfect opportunity to make some changes in this vein...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=002006&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=002006&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
