</FONT><HR><BR>This was a response to a thread complaing about high lvl players wanting "favoritism"<P>If you dont have a lvl 51+ player, actually it should be 55+ you have no idea.  Everquest at lvl 55 is a FAR FAR different world than it was at 35.<P>At 35 I could pretty much walk anywhere and get XP in a zone.  Getting a rez was a non issue. heck you can get by without a cleric.  6 person groups are viable.  Cash was always an issue.  Never had enough cash, spent time at auctions, selling fine steel, etc...<P>Buffs didnt cost 11pp a shot, there was no such thng as a "raid" you didnt need 30 people to do anything.  In fact most times you could log on and actually start killing within minutes.<P>lvl 55+ you need a key to go anywhere, you cant get any loot without a cleric, you pretty much need a cleric for everything unless you want to risk losing 20+ hours of XP from a single mistake.<P>You cant walk anywhere to get XP, almost everything in the old world is green, anything above green in kunark requires a key or a raid.<P>In SOV you are high lvl yet greens can kill you easy.  at least in the old world, greens were no threat, go to SOV i dont care if you are lvl 60, get 1-3 greens on you unprepared, and you are toast.<P>Its 2 completely differnt games. 1-50 is fun its challenging etc.. but its completely differnt.<P>Until you have planned a raid for 1 week only to spend 8 hours getting everyones corpse and rezzing because of a single mistake or because the cleric went linkdead, you have no idea.<P>The 55+ game is extremely stressful,  it can be exciting, rewarding, but usually its lots and lots of effort and honestly not really worth it.<P>XPing takes too long, raiding for loot takes 8 hours at a clip, getting groups together takes too long etc..<P>at lvl 35 you can run down to lower guk or droga or FM or dreadlands or anywhere in SOV and start hunting.<P>at lvl 55 you need a gate everywhere, or a key or a rogue, there is no running over to a zone and getting a group.  YOu have to bring your group everywhere you go.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is the exact reason I think the biggest VI supporters still love EQ. Level 55+ is a big chore and you truly need to devote insane ammounts of time to advance. Many, many of EQ's longest fans realize the high end game is a frustrating chore much of the time, so they never even bother getting there.<P>Would you have more fun in EQ with 4 level 35 characters or one level 58 character? Guess it depends on the player.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>The only thing I disagree on is the level range. EQ is a very different game from level 1-35 compared to 36-60. <P>It really stinks to invest the time into a game, only to grow weaker against your environment and the mobs 5 levels lower than you.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The 50+ game (actually 52+ for my Magician) is simply not made for the casual gamer.  Soloing is either painfully boring or out of the question after 51, IMO.  Pick-up groups are much more difficult to assemble and the battles are overly long and almost tedious at times.  <P>The early levels are fast and furious. Spells cast quickly, hits disappear fast and downtime is minimal.  I have semi-retired my 54 Magician and am playing an Enchanter that is now 12th level.  This has certainly extended my EQ life but I do look forward ot the next generation of MMORPG's and hope that they do a better job of balancing solo vs group play throughout all the levels.  EQ is a brilliant, ground breaking game but it relies to heavily on the massive group, massive time commitment model in the later levels.  <P>BTW, enchanter is a perfectly viable solo class. With mess, stun and charm spells you can wreak havoc  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> If you are a bored high level necro, Magicina or druid looking for another solo class to play you should try playing a chanter.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sorry, but EQ is just not that hard--there is no great enlightenment achieved by repeating a series of keyboard sequences until your character reaches level 60.  It takes stubbornness and time--lots of time.  There are no mysterious "issues" that require a PhD in Advanced Nuclear Game-onics.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;Its dull tedious and boring. Thats why there are so many twinks, its a shame.<P>I wouldn't play a game that was dull and tedious and boring. Must be a lot of Masochists in Sebilis.<P>There were so many twinks a year ago, before Kunark was released. Before anyone could be level 51+.<P>I don't object to treating the high level game different from the low level game. I object people at high level wanting the low level game changed or ignored. But some of the high level players often take the attitude that levels 1-50 are nothing but stepping stones you cross over quickly and avoid as much content as possible. Then want Verant to focus all efforts and new content and bug fixes for the high level game. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree with the original poster.<BR>It took me one year to make 50th level.  It will be approximately one more year to make 60th.  (57th atm)<BR>Now you can make it to 50th much quicker with some changes and that the average player at lower levels is much better equiped, but still half of the game is from 50-60.<BR>The below 50 levels do work, its the above 50, especially above 55 that requires the most attention.  Why?  Well it doesnt have to do with the elitist or uber peeps crying, it has to do with whats at stake.  A death at 57th level will result in two and a half blue bubbles of experience lost.  To gain that back without a rez would take 10 to 15 hours or straight fighting.  Where can a 57th person hunt?  Not very many places actually.  Almost everything is green. <BR>Its not a knock against lower levels, they play the game too, its just SO SO different at high levels.  Its 50 percent of the game, yet most think its 1/6th of the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Before you start telling me somehow I am an elitist etc.. remember I played through these lvls.<P>I remember the day when I first walked to north ro as a human at night, and thought, hmm maybe I can kill that.<P>Compare that to walking into Velious and conning a green mob, then that green mob kills you in 2 min.  Not even close to the same game.  The sense of adventure is replaced with a sense of caution.<P>Before you could explore areas and run around checking stuff out, at the higher lvls you can check out green dngs if you are really boared, but dngs your lvl, you have to spend days questing for a key, then spend hours gathering up a cleric/chanter/warrior/rogue etc.. just to explore.  Die 1nce? and you need a necro/SK to get your corpse.  Ooops you are on the wrong side of Kael, cant summon corpse here etc...<P>AT high lvls gone is the Adventure and explore, its replaced with maximum efficiecny, everything is a chore</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I still don't understand why Verant couldn't have simply scaled the game up better. Why demand that everyone be in giant raids? What happened to the 6 person experience group in the high levels? Why should the gameplay have changed so much post 50? Seems like a conscious, and poor, design decision.<P>This is a big reason why people complain about feeling underpowered, because being one person in thirty means, for the most part, you're not that important.<P>Finally, why do people lose so much ground to the environment? Why is conning so useless at high levels?<P>Experience penalties are too big, and environment too harsh. Those factors seriously discourage exploration and risk-taking. It's just not worth it.<P>If some people beat the game, they beat the game. If FOH can farm Sleeper's Tomb and the Plane of Mischief now, more power to them. They win. Woot. They should not be your concern. It should be the 95% who are not over-powered uberguilders, not the 5% who are.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

At lower lvls, you can go to almost any zone and get a pick up group.  You can get a druid or shaman to heal, if you have a cleric and chanter thats just a bonus, a paladin can be your main tank etc..<P>At higher lvls there are less zones to hunt in, however those zones require perfectly balanced groups to hunt in, and in the case of plans and SOV you often need 2-5 groups to hunt effectively in those zones.<P>So say you gather up 3 friends, but you dont have a cleric... you arent doing any dngs, maybe just do some outdoor hunting.<P>Lets say you get a cleric but no enchanter, this rules out about 3/4 of all high lvl dngs.  Sebilis without a chanter? waste of time too much downtime for the cleric.<P>Now you assume that when you log on the high lvl players will be consolodated in a few zone.  Uber guilds raiding the dain. or sleepers, another guild raiding Kael, another in necropolis.  <P>Look over to sebilis? pretty much every player in sebilis is already in a full group, its a keyed zone in diff zone out zone, which means you dont just walk in and hang around looking for a pick up group.  Its VERY out of the way from any city, you pretty much need a gate there and if you are a melee player you are crazy to go there alone and hope for a pick up group cause if you zone in , you have no way out without begging for a gate.<P>ALso all the groups in sebilis are usually full and if they are looking for a replacement usually its done through tells or guildchat.<P>Basically sebilis is bring your own group.  Chardok is similar (only no key) this zone is bring your own raid 2+ groups.  Howling stones?&gt; need a key and no safe zone in, basically zone in and get ready to fight.<P>Kael? you need at least 2 groups and have to go very deep in the fight.  necropolis is a 3 group min zone etc...<P>There are basically no dngs that you can hang out in like lower guk or karnors and look for a group or just start a pick up group.<P>The other problem is shortage of high lvl chanters/clerics.<P>Uberguilds constantly recruit high lvl clerics, 99% of high lvl clerics are grouped when I log on and have 3-5 offers on the table for raids that night.  Enchanters? ususally getting XP in sebilis, or farming XP in karnors, the rest are on raids or playing their alts (usually rogues or warriors)<P>then you have the burned out clerics.  They perma camp in the plane of hate, and only log on when there is a hate raid so they can get their armour.<P>I have never been on a hate raid with less than 5 clerics.<P>Most of my time online is spent planning stuff, convincing clerics/enchanters to join my raids, trying to form XP groups, gating people around to the spot where we are going to farm XP etc..<P>Dont get me started on the Epic quest time sinks,  almost forgot about these.  You have no idea what a time sink in EQ is til you try the warrior or wizzard or SK epic.   Raiding the plane of fear/hate for the 44th time, it gets really old watching Cazic Thule drop lame bard weapons that no one wants.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Even a 49 ress from a death sets you back an hour or 2.<P>Verant needs to lower the penalty of death 55+ a resonable amount.<P>Besides the fact you need boats loads of exp just to move the blue exp bar,  most areas are green mobs.  You need more exp and have less places to get it.  Hell even a lot of spots are half green in sebilis at 59.  <P>Verant really needs to add a few more sebilis/karnors type zones for the 53+ people.  Not raid places, exp group places.

</FONT><HR>Dr has it about right, as far as I can tell from my 38th level perspective. My girlfriend is just about to ding 51 with her chanter and I am interested to see what happens from then on. At the moment she's still making good xp in pick-up groups in Burning Woods, so my guess is that the real end of "Real EQ" is around 55th level as many people claim.<P>My strong impression is that there are less players who intend or even wish to get to 55+ than there are players who will build several characters into the 30s and 40s. Once the promised revision of much of the Old World mid-level zones takes place (supposed to happen after the end of class balancing) there will be even more incentive to play through the part of the game that actually works again.<P>I think the idea was probably to provide a "club" atmosphere for the real die-hard players who'd have the drive and time to get to 55+, hence the expectation that there'd be enough of them around to play in a several-group/raid style almost as the norm. Unfortunately with the multiple hell-levels and the overpowering of the Velious high-end mobs, Verant seems to have overestimated the mental stamina of the high-end players and burnout is now becoming endemic for the 55+ crowd.<P>I am confident that by the time I wander my way through to 50th (should take me until about August I reckon), many of these problems will have been solved. After all, the mid-levels are a cakewalk compared to what they would have been 12 - 18 months ago.<P>Not much comfort to the people suffering now, but then, that's the lot of the pioneer.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I believe you when you say that 50+ and 55+ is different from 1-50, BUT that doesn't mean that we don't have problems at levels 1-50.  When you were in the 1-50 range things were different.  I can only speak to you from a wizzie's perspective, but I can tell you with all the equipment that used to be the good stuff trikling down to the mid-level ranges, I find it hard to keep up with melees in damage.  Nuke something down fast you say?  Hardly.  Oh, I could.  Only if I was sowed and in an outdoor zone with running room and the mob is snared.  If I try to nuke something down without that, It will eat me for breakfast.  Its even worse in Velious with stuff double hitting for 70 and I only have about 600hp or so WITH greater shielding.  I'm not trying to take away from the problems higher levels have, but the people in the 1-50 range need to be looked at too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I played a lot over the last couple of years and have a variety of the 32-46 range chars at my disposal.  I also have 6 different classes post 50 and out of those 6 2 are 55+ (one of the two played jointly).  I know the end game is much different.  <P>And for those in the lower 1-50's although I do feel your pain in the difficulty of your levels and do not think that you quite grasp what a lot of these people are trying to express to you.  Yes it sounds simple but remember these players went through your pain too.  In fact.  Contrary to what you may believe (I know playing my little toy ranger up in the early 40's even now is quite challenging) many of these players had it far more difficult than you can imagine.  Warriors back then?  /rofl  Warriors were almost scoffed at.  They didn't have the hp bonus.  Most classes could wear the same armor.  There wasn't a dramatic difference in them and many of the other classes.  Etc.  (Don't take this as bashing warriors.  I love mine now when I play him $$) <P>And I don't think there are many of these post 50 players that are against some improvements to those levels.  But these levels had a year of improvement (and beta etc) to be improved upon before post 50 was even an option.  There have still been more improvements to the class even still.  And for that I am very glad for you.  Never know when another server might come out and I take a hankering to take up the next character that inspires me (actually paying my college loans and bills off actually serves more as my inspiration /groan and EQ keeps me from spending too much money on other things)  I'd love for that character to have the new benefits that are slowly trickling down into the pre-50's right now.  I think they are tremendous improvements from that perspective.  Ranger tracking?  I toy around with a ranger at pre-50 now and they are actually quite nice for a change.  Boost that defense of theirs to the offensive ability of the knight classes and I would say (I know...  Hades will have frozen over and I'll be sure to see a psychologist to make sure I'm alright.) Rangers are one of the better tuned classes in the game finally and are truly fixed.  <P>But sorry I lost my focus for a moment.  Although the pre 50's classes have had from games inception to be improved upon.  Although they could use a little more twinking...  They are doing rather well atm.  Post 50?  Well.  Verant is trying patch after patch to compensate but they uber nerf all mobs (to prevent druids and wizards from kiting these uber mobs easily etc.) to be able to summon and gate (Laf  I don't remember any instances of watching a mob gate while I was pre-50 only to summon me so I faced it one on one to meet my death and then do the same to the rest of my group.   This really happened to me the other night in Sebilis though and since I was the evac'r only 2 of the group survived and we had to fight back down to get the cleric who had camped.)  and other insane abilities.  Yeah you got more hp but you should see what some of these mobs do damage wise.  Even to a well armor'd tank.  They cut through them virtually like Paper Mache'.  Talk about strategy?  Unless you have a large number of Clerics and tanks (preferably warriors as the game currently stands) don't even bother with Uber Mob A.  With my lowly right at 1000AC I was in Tim.Deep to see myself get Quad'd for my total HP bar then some by a single mob.  One shot dead.  There went a whole day or two of exp.  And then go searching for a cleric.  <P>What I'm trying to say if I could keep from rambling on (there's so much to say and so hard to put into a post) is that we don't want the pre50's excluded but as one other poster said...  Post 50 is really about half the game.  I can get to 50 in about 25-40 days playing time&lt;depending on class&gt;  It takes about double that to get near 60 unless you strictly Solo and what fun is that?  The post 50 game is still broken for the most part and needs a lot of work.  Then they throw in nerfs such as the Hate List changes (although they seem to be working to rectify this even though they refuse to simply change it back) and things such as Multiquesting nerfs which sounds great in theory from the perspective of many people who haven't been fortunate to get to the end game yet to avoid topics such as twinking, &lt;talk about cut off your nose to spite your face&gt; but they'll find how useful that really was later on.  And they continue to nerf.  Although I have to disagree with Alan/Absor with his last few escapades I am glad to see him trying.  He seems to be much better for the player base IMO than we grew up with although I fear he may be slipping into that auto-defensive deluded state (/poke Absor /say SNAP OUT OF IT!).  As for the rest of you pre-50's out there.  I wish you the best of luck and someday hopefully we'll get to play together on some level or another and perhaps things will become more apparent.  Until then enjoy the levels that are so much more balanced than the ones we currently face (heheh  you didn't think they just called them hell levels because of exp did ya?)<P>Good luck all,<BR>Shil</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I DISagree 100%<P>I just hit 50, and things are really getting damn fun now. challenging mobs, not this wimpy stuff that one group member can solo. you get the occasional rare drops that sell for big amounts, not that jump you get in sol b and guk like serp bracers or shield of the slain unicorn that NOBODY wants. stuff that you'd actually use, drops.<P>1-40 was kinda fun, then it got boring as HELL from 40-50 where you just level to level, and get 46, then get 51 where you start getting cool. new skill increases, new spells if you're a caster, etc., etc. You get to fight with the big boys in the difficult dungeons, go in high scale raids when you want, and so on.<P>so what, you need a cleric+enc.....it's NOT that hard to find. If we have no enc in KC for example, we make a moat group where you can pull singles easily. Cleric is needed, yes, but there are lots of clerics about, and I have noticed almost nothing of this hate change. we use CH all the time and clerics never get jumped.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

"--<P>Forgive my presumption to include some maths here but you just descibed 2 out of 6 slots going to 2 out of 14 classes. Unless of course you want 2.3 clerics and 2.3 enchanters for every other class? You think clerics and enchanters should be over twice as common as all other classes?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
