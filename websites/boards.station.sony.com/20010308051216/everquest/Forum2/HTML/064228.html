</FONT><HR>It has been said that many of the greatest guilds to enter EQ are fed up with the many recent changes, from Agro to the multiple nerfs that have hit the cleric class (mok, Bp, Bp, Bp, Hate, and now new PoG Bp).<P>What we have are the Guilds like FoH, LoS, AL and other Uber guilds all about to have the bulk of there members walk away from this game. Am I being extream, not at all, many have made posts that there members are dropping like flys.  FoH has reported that they are on the outs with Verant.<P>This is not a flame, this is just a heads up. Yes EQ will survive, the Uber Guilds are only 5-10% of the game population but the thing is. <BR>The bulk of the game changes and balancing over the past 2 years has come on the backs of Guilds like FoH that have basicly tested the game and had dev teams follow them on raids and new zones (see VP or even first Vox Raids etc).<P>So lets say the bulk of the "Uber Guilds leave" now we have a game that will take longer for problems and mechanics to be solved. The people us newer players look up to will be few and far between, yes even though you might not like a guild the fact they can kill a rare dragon etc is something to be in awe of. <P>The game economy will suffer as medium quallity gear now becomes more uber because the guilds that get the best will no longer be feeding the world items they have no use for. <P>People will assume that since the best are leaving the game might just not be that good. <BR>If you dont think this is the case see past PC titles. <P>Do I think Verant should cave in and do everything it can to keep uber guilds happy not at all. However I do think that by nerfing or making things to easy or hard from them will effect every one of us down the road.<P>Personally despite what many feel about Uber guilds and people like Furor in demi god status as a player and character. We need to understand that without them we are far worse then it may seem.<P>Just some thoughts. <BR>Good luck to all the big guilds that are awaiting the next couple of patches I certainly hope there is open comunication with Dev to find some balance in the changes that will be acceptable for both sides.<P>If not its been a blast hearing about your triumps and failures.<P>Not a Uber character or a power game<P>Voo<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Obviously not all uberguilds are evil empires.<P>However, there are a lot of in-game issues related to uber-guilds and I think a lot of people will be happy if this were to take place.<P>I am a little perplexed by people taking such note of people leaving now.<P>People have been leaving EQ since its inception.  <P>I think the bigger issue is people are running out of things to do.  Yes there are still some challenges left for some people in Velious but not many.<P>I just think you have a lot of people who have hit 60 now and got nothing else to do.  <P>We can blame all these people leaving on Verant, but I think a lot of people would have left anyways, just in a much quieter manner.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Dear god, the other 90-95% of the players may actually have a chance have some fun and get some good items!!<P>I doubt any Uber Guilds will leave.

</FONT><HR>Lets see.  How many times has some really cool feature been nerfed to uselessness because some Uber-guild exploited it up the wazooo?  They don't cause improvements to the game -- they make it worse.<P>Perhaps now that FoH is finally on the outs with Verant, Verant will stop catering to them and their ilk and start looking at the fun factor for the other 90% of the players.<P>Voodoo you can take you guild and leave.

</FONT><HR>Lyenea- unless you either a. are in an uber guild or b. have a very organized pick-up raid...you will never see any of those "uber" items that drop of mobs like trakanon or venril sathir.  Try to organize a raid with a bunch of greedy players that all want that item and watch someone ninja loot it and gate.  The fact is guilds like FoH are encouraged by Verant seeing as how you need a massive force to go get these items.  What better to get together with your friends and get them for everyone?<P>And the items exploited by the uber guilds?  How do you exploit an item when that was the way it was intended for use?  Its like saying how do you cheat in a game with rules that can't be broken.  Verant just doesnt want a few warriors and clerics with those BP to go take down a dragon or the like.

</FONT><HR>It's amazing how petty jealousy trumps good sense. People, it's not that we care that uber guilds are leaving -- it's what that says about the high end game.<P> If it's tedious and frustrating for people that have 150 days played, how do you think it will be for the "casual gamer". And no, I'm not talking about the planes and Vox etc, but the SoV stuff. It's not the uber guilds, its the game, and the fact that many people are fed up isn't a good sign. <P>But I guess it's easier to say bash guilds most of you prolly don't even know.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>okay- leaving aside negative comments about ubers (I think folks know how I feel about them in general).<P>Having on group of &lt;1% players who can play for 12 hour straight and deliver 30 players who act as a team to fight a monster does a severe injury to the rest of the players (&gt;95% easily) who play for 3-7 hours, and can deliver 30 players who are a ragtag mob at best.<P>The ubers cause the encounters to be tuned harder and harder everytime they start repeatedly beating something.<P>Clearly, Velkator could only be done by a very elite mixture of equipment and players.  For any of the regular players to attempt it is suicide.<P>There are a lot of Velkators out there lately.  And they are just "dead" content for the regular players.  Even if the ubers disappeared tomorrow, it would be weeks or months before players developed a good enough non-uber set of players (like on Tunare where for some reason the uber guilds didnt' take hold-- they do things pickup all the time).<P>So even leaving out all the other negatives which come with uber guilds, they are still bad for all the other players because they cause Verant to make the game harder and harder until only ubers can do things.<P>Personally I wish verant would just let you guys "win" so you could quit.  Or level cap half the dungeons to stop the farming.  If they want to set up half of Vellious for you, that's fine- just think of some ways to push you out of the ordinary game-- Moons of Norath, Level Caping dungeons, whatever.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
