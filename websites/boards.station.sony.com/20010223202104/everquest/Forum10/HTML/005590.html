</FONT><HR>Grouping is this games greatest strength. In a solid group you can do a lot more then 6 times what you would be able to do alone. It’s just another case of the whole being more then the sum of its parts. There are many issues with grouping, but as they arise just ask here for info on the best way to handle things.<P>Basically you need:<P>1 Cleric: They should Never nuke, unless to stun a runner or caster. Always keep the entire group buffed with their best Daring spell. Always keep the main tank and Enchanter alive.<P>1 Enchanter: They should also never nuke, they should keep breeze on the casters, and haste on the tanks. Their main job is to Mez Any additional mobs that come.<P>1 Warrior:  The puller, they should be the main assist person, his job is to taunt nasties off the enchanter and cleric as well other casters. He must select a target as quickly as possible and stick with it until its dead. <P>1 Wizard: Deliver the killing Blow and stop runners before they have a chance to call for help. If a Wizard only casts one spell the entire fight and kills the runner then he is doing his job. At later levels its also the Wiz/Dru responsibility to Evac.<P><BR>This is the foundation for a solid group. They are the primary classes. You can add any other 2 classes to the group depending what’s available. Bards are one of the best classes to add to the group, but also one of the hardest classes in the game to play correctly. Mage or Druid can replace the Wizard at lower levels, A Mage AND a Druid can replace the Wizard at any level. (One for the damage one for the Evac) and Rangers, rogues Pallys and SK’s  can replace the warrior to some extent. Later on the Monk becomes the best puller once they get FD. At this point the Warrior switches roles to taunter and assist person.<P>When you make your own group, first start with a cleric and chanter. Use the following method:<P>This example will assume the group leader is level 25<P>/Who all 22 28 Cle<P>Then send tell to the people who are NOT in a dungeon. Anyone who is not in a dungeon is worth a tell at least. Keep hitting the up key and just change the Cle to whatever class you need. <P>Also do a:<P>/who all 22 28 LFG<P>Again the best people to send a tell to are the ones in Town or areas that they can’t get experience. For example you find a level 28 cleric in East commons, and you know they are not in the middle of a fight. You will need someone who can port the group sometimes when you find people that are far away from your current zone. People may not like getting a tell asking for money or items but in most cases they do not mind getting a tell for a group invite. <P>This can take some time to master and the entire group can take 20-30 minutes (or more) to put together. But as you find someone that you like as a person and a player don’t forget them and next time you log start with them. There are many things in this game to master, but making a group is one that will always be useful and is a skill that is great to master. <P>This is just a foundation for getting groups, there is a lot more to add or ask about so I opened up this thread for just that reason.<P>[55 Conjurer] Zandar (Human) &lt;Companions of the Gate&gt; ZONE: Bristlebane<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If I could tailor a group I would do this:<P>Warrior Main Tank and Damage Dealer, pulls the mob.<BR>Cleric, off to the side, casting heals.<BR>Paladin or Ranger, bobber and weaver, secondary tank, tops off hitpoints between melees.  Can take over for main tank if they need to back up.<BR>Spell Caster, off with Cleric, doing their spell thing.<BR>Rogue, hiding while mob is Pulled, backstabbing at every opp., watching the back of the casters.  <P>The Rogue should be the looter too, whereas it is autosplit, and they run looted items in order to people that are resting.<P>So that gives me<BR>1) Warrior, 2) Cleric 3) Paladin/Ranger 4) Caster 5) Rogue and as a 6th, I would prefer a back-up tank, one that can take turns with tank 1.  The "spare" tank would also be good to watch out for those bothersome wandering mobs, that show up during battle.  He/She could help out Rogue with protecting the casters, and jump in for a very hard battle.<P>This is for a level 12ish group.  We should be able to take on an onslaught of orcs, lions, etc, in rapid succesion with this grouping.<P>High levels I have no idea, have not been there.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR> That is surely another issue with grouping . The Loot, The best way to do it IMO is a master looter. But the problem is you have to be able to trust the person. At lower levels where money is tight, I think master looting would only be appropriate when you know each other very well.  But always when grouped the best way to do Item loot is only allow the people to roll for the item that can immediately upgrade something they are using. <P>Then they should take their old item and random it to the group (Or give to another person who could use it in the group). That way at the end of the day if you find 2 good items, you really have 4 items in play and everyone has a better chance of getting something.<P>I agree with you at these levels have extra tanks are the way to go. The rogue can and should Melee at all time as well though. The problem is the more tanks you have the more back up healing you need. having 3 people for a cleric to heal is a lot more difficult then having just one main tank.<P>You are also right, and is the reason I made this thread. With a solid group not only can you take an onslaught of lions etc, but you can do it (When you get used to each other) Without Stopping for a second. Zero down time. All casters need to learn to Sit down as soon as they are done casting, however until level 35 (When the Book goes away) That is difficult to do.<P>Point is, you can Tailor a group, and if you start doing this now, by the time you get to be my level you will NEVER be without a group. You will log in to people sending you tells asking to be in your group tonight, or to group with their group.<P>Above everything Everquest is about playing a game with friends, those you know in RL, know from Norrath or have yet to meet.  When you have groups like this, you can go to places that you would NEVER survive alone or in a half group.<P>[55 Conjurer] Zandar (Human) &lt;Companions of the Gate&gt; ZONE: Bristlebane<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If the tank is tanking properly, the cleric/healer should have no more work to do than if there was only one tank. Judicious application of the 'taunt' skill should keep it so that only the main tank is taking damage. This becomes extremely important at higher levels when the cleric can Complete Heal the main tank. If everyone is taking damage, it takes a lot more of the cleric's mana to keep 'em healed using the smaller (and less mana-efficient) heals. <P>A great class to add there is a ranger. Rangers get the taunt skill (I believe), and have spells to taunt as well. With a warrior as main tank, and a ranger as secondary/caster rescue, a group can tear through mobs like no tomorrow  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">. When a mob gets agroed on a caster, the ranger goes into action (leaves the primary target mob) and taunts the mob off of the caster, taking the hits for a minute while they finish up the primary target.<P>Of course, most of my experience is grouping *without* an enchanter, so we have a lot of standard tactics like that. If you have a good enchanter, you'll rarely need to taunt mobs off of casters. I've noticed that clerics and chanters usually work closely together to keep mobs mezzed... when one mob comes unstuck and heads for the chanter, the cleric pops a heal on the chanter (changing the agro to the cleric), the chanter mezzes it again, and everyone's happy. The tanks usually don't even notice  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif">.<P>*Ashara*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Zander,<BR>   I agree with your post but like AshraLyn said a ranger is also benifical at least in the 30's that I know of.  I am not of the level in the post 50 game so I do not know if a ranger would be a great benifit or a burden.  But being a ranger one thing I am doing is pulling the mobs in and than letting the warrior take the brunt while I am smacking the mob down also and keeping an eye on the casters to make sure they are ok because if there is an add on usually they come at the wrong time.  So I peel off and taunt of the caster and deal with that mob until the tank is done.  Plus having tracking makes pulling mobs a lot easier.  <P>Currently I am in Iceclad and when I am pulling the casters have to learn to rest during the fight  because as soon as the mob is down to 1/4 health I am off to get me another mob one night we had a chanter and a shamen in the group so I got a sow from the shamen and clarity from the chanter and I non stop pulled (chain) for 6 hours using only one spell flamelick just to get the ac debuff in.  The only time I stopped for a second was to roll on the earings and if I was beat I left right away to get us more mobs.<P>I believe good groups can come in many forms up to and probably into the 40's.  Your statement sounds most true in the 50+ game.<P><BR>Dayhel Pathweaver<BR>Ranger of 38 summers<BR>Terris</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Now as i see it, in the teens it would be a good idea to substitute a druid or shaman for one of the back up tank spots. so you would have:<P>1.cleric <BR>2.war (tank)<BR>3.rngr/sk/pal(sec tank, taunt off casters in bad pull)<BR>4.wiz/nec/mage<BR>5.rogue/bard(love a well played rogue)<BR>6.shaman/druid/bard (back up healer)<P>now as for the bard i have to say i good bard is a nice addition to a group, i say they can be back up healers to some degree as thy can twist restoration hym in combat and if tanks are doin there job then everyones hp is topped off and the healer only need worry the tanks. <P>as for the druid or shaman. in an emergency they can be sec tank and back up healers. <P>as for rangers we can top off in down time or pull or sec tank or if need be tank ( not suggested though ) if we tank then a anther tank is nec.<P>if you play at peak times then sure you can put together the perfect group but this is not a perfect Norrath and we sometimes have to make do with what is at our disposal. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>What Zandar is alluding too is setting up a group under ideal conditions. I agree 100% with the base choices unfortunately it can take a lot of time trying to gather that perfect balance.  Most pick-up groups have players dropping in and out over a period of time. Dynamics will change constantly and this tends to effect support classes more than anything. Good communication makes for a successful group, a good leader will ensure that everybody understands their role in the group. Unless you have friends (or guild)that you group with constantly it will be very difficult to find Utopia.<P>Tusan Oakanfist<BR>lv 50 Druid<BR>Tunare </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Dayhel  I agree Rangers are great. I think their taunt value is a little high, although Im not sure if Verant changed that. It would seem that the rangers naturally high taunt has been lowered recently. Last night I went to Sebilis with some friends, here is the group we had:<P>1 Cleric<BR>1 Chanter<BR>1 Druid<BR>1 Magician (Yours truly)<BR>2 Rangers (Both have their Epic weapons)<P>Let me tell you, we were unstoppable. We had zero downtime and in fact I don’t think I went below 60 Mana at any point during the night. We got great XP, tons of loot (4 spells, Cobolt Arms, and something else I forget) and we killed anything that was unlucky enough to be around when we were looking. <P>I didn’t mean to over look rangers, in fact I mentioned that the Warrior can often be replaced by Rangers, Pallys, SK and Rogues in some cases. I was just saying the main 4 classes are : Warrior, chanter, Cleric and Wizard. The other 2 can be ANY class. As well there are a few classes that can replace the Warrior and Wizard in some cases.  The Cleric can be replaced pre-49 with 2 Shaman/Druids if they are on Healing duty only, but the higher level you get the more they can not do that. Like I said get the 4 basic classes and go from there. <P>I was on a Chardok Royals raid on Sunday (No We didn’t kill the Overking he got away, but look how close we had him: http://www.geocities.com/flyingrutabaga/Royals.jpg  and \\royals2.jpg) The Ranger was the Primary assist, (And she rocks). <P>So The role of assist as well as protecting the casters is a Rangers specialty in the post 50 game. Rangers deal HUGE amounts of damage so don’t listen to the Gendis board about the complaints. <P>I Didn't forget about any class. Pallys rock as well.  In fact every class has its place. Necros are great in the post 50 game on raids. They can Mez a Single mob, feed mana better then any other class, DOT like mad and do other wonderful things.<P>Every class has its place, the trick is learning what your role is. Tusan is correct and this is truth. Things change very rapidly and its very difficult to find utopia.<P>For this reason I recommend striving for a Semi - permanent group. A well rounded group that always plays at the same time of day, and you get to be great friends. That is something I have never had, however I have mastered the Pick-up group and this is what I’m trying to share with you now.<P>For a great Ranger story try this:<P> During that fight with the OverKing, [You will notice his health is very low]. Before our last rogue died the Door was open, the King ran out and so did our Primary assist Kymma who followed him. Well the door closed and left here on the other side of a locked door (That requires a Rogue with a 201 skill in lock pick to open- both were dead). With a very angry King attacking her she SOLO’d him for a LONG time (I couldn’t believe how long), after he finally killed her he came back in and his HP was NOT visible. She really kicked his butt. So Rangers are wicked damage dealers and with the right gear (Emphasizing AC I believe) can really do very well for the group or raid they are on.<P>[55 Conjurer] Zandar (Human) &lt;Companions of the Gate&gt; ZONE: Bristlebane<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Zandar,<BR>   I do agree with your statement.  I was just stating that in the mid 40 and lower game we could just be interchangeable with a warrior.  Post that we would be a mana sink and get the crap knocked out of us.  I also dont belive they changed the taunt much we were fighting cougars and the make up of the group was warrior, ranger, shamen, druid, cleric, mage.  I pulled a cougar and two popped right on top of me as I was coming back to the group, well everyone was doing there thing and the cleric had to heal the mage was blasting the shamen was dotting and the druid was blasting and those cougars never left me the cleric had to heal me 3 times for me to live as these cougars must have been urber cougars when I scrolled back on the battle they hit me for an avg of 47 points everytime they hit me.  Plus some things just like me because I am a ranger I think.<P>I cant wait to start my epic weapon quests I have some of the forageable items but it will be awhile before I can get underway and get the required pieces.<P><BR>Dayhel Pathweaver <BR>Ranger of 38 summers<BR>Terris  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Forming a group based on specific classes ultimately prevents players of non-specialist classes from grouping. Furthermore, it makes finding a group extremely difficult, since you may not be able to locate a member of a specific class. Therefore, I like to form my groups based on roles. The core of my groups are as follows:<P>1. Primary Tank - this character's task is to hold the attention of attacking MOBs, and needs to be of a class with high hit points, high ac, and the Taunt skill. Warrior, Paladin, and Shadow Knight do this best; at low to mid levels, a Ranger will also suffice.<P>2. Secondary Tank - this character also needs to be capable of handling the attentions of attacking MOBs. Taunt skill is a plus, but not required. Warrior, Monk, Rogue, Ranger, Paladin, and Shadow Knight all do this well (though each does it a little differently); I even sometimes use a strong pet in this role.<P>3. Primary Healer - this person's job is to keep everyone alive. Clerics do this best, but in many cases a Druid, Shaman, or even a Paladin can fill this role, though this may depend on the class balance and tactics employed by the group.<P>4. Primary Nuker - this person's job is to accelerate the rate at which the group kills MOBs. He needs to be capable of dishing out large amounts of damage quickly. Wizard, Magician, and even Druid do this very well; Enchanters can even fill this role at low level, as can Shaman or Necromancer (OK, a good DoT may not do its damage quickly, but it does it reliably).<P><BR>The other 2 slots can be used in a variety of ways. They can be used to shore up weaknesses in the primary roles (e.g. I could only get a Paladin for primary healer, so I want somebody else with some healing), it can be used to add a crowd control expert (such as an Enchanter), it can be used to add a generalist character who adds a little of everything (like a Bard or Druid), it can be used to add an extra class with abilities especially suited for what we are hunting (e.g. an extra Paladin, Neromancer, or Cleric for dealing with Undead, or an extra Druid for dealing with Elemental creatures), it can be used to add an extra Tank if I feel it's needed, it can be used to add a class with excellent pulling skills (such as a Monk, Shadow Knight, or Ranger), a mana-regenerator, etc.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Something to keep in mind that Zandar is a self-confessed spelunker (translation: he spends most of his time in dungeons).  It doesn't take any work at all to put together a group that can do the snow cougars (which I absolutely love for great xp, constant action, and low risk), in fact I know from experience that just a 35 warrior and 36 cleric can do it with zero downtime  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/eek.gif">.  However, I have used Zandar's technique many times, starting around level 25 when I was trying to put groups together for the Mistmoore zone line.  (Note: he meant "shift up-arrow" to bring back the "/who cleric 20 30" so you can backspace and substitute some other healing class after discovering that there aren't any clerics in that 11-level range on the entire continent of Faydwer.  Secondary note: I actually included bards in my quest for healers, since if you have a mezzer the zone line mobs aren't so tough that you need healing during the battle and they can do both.  Tertiary note: bards are the weirdest, funkiest class in the game, completely unclassifiable.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/confused.gif"> )<P>Dungeons are special.  It is difficult to control pacing, because you usually have to rest someplace where mobs spawn or wander (only enchanters, bards, and necros can speed up the healers' mana regen, and necros can only do it by giving their own away).  It is difficult to pull singles because you can't see around corners, there's no room for shifting direction and pulling it off to the side past the one that spawned behind you, harmony doesn't work indoors, and lull causes aggro when resisted (only enchanters, bards, and necros can mez adds).  MR becomes a major factor, because you are often forced to fight casting mobs that see invis, so a single successful fear or charm could result in a nigh-unretrievable corpse, not to mention a dead group (warriors not only have a steadily-increasing level-based hp bonus, they also have a steadily-increasing MR bonus -- with my gear I'm up to 81 unbuffed at level 36 -- and bards, enchanters, shamen, clerics, and druids can all buff MR).  You *cannot* let runners get away (finishing them off in one blow is the most efficient way to accomplish that, and while many classes get good nukes, only wizards can be sure of having a recent one to which the mobs in any given dungeon are not overly resistant).  Finally, many mid- and high-level dungeons can be harder to get out of than to get into; some literally have one-way entrances, with the exit past the boss mob (only wizards and druids can evac the group).<P>When I put together a group for ordinary xp hunting, it's just "Tank, I am one, check; healer, of course Genamorfie is here, check; ok, we can kill stuff now and anyone else who wants to join can".  When I put together a group for a dungeon crawl, it is very, very different.  I agree with Zandar's basis for a group that can take *any* non-raid-scale challenge appropriate for their level (and having a warrior is absolutely non-negotiable to me -- since I am one  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> ).<P>Tudan &lt;Flux of Chaos&gt;<BR>a_barbarian_warrior36<BR>Torvonnilous</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I completely forgot to mention why clerics are necessary, because it goes without saying: revive/rez.  If anyone should happen to die while the group is already past two locked doors, or where the nearest spot for melee binding is a 20-minute run away, there's no substitute in terms of time saved and risk negated for being able to just cast a spell and bring them instantly back to their corpse.  Yes, even the melee binding problem creates *risk* for dungeon groups, because 15 minutes just to get back to the same zone is long enough for respawn; most non-casters will need someone to meet them to invis them back to the group, so the group will have to either evac out and rebreak the spawn, or else meet the respawn while at least two people short of full.  Plus, there is absolutely no substitute anywhere in the game for getting back some of the xp that you lost when you died.  Even in easier dungeons where clerics aren't needed for things like complete heal and AoE heal, they will still be needed just for revive/rez.<P>Tudan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>As an SK if I group I usually play the secondary tank for the simple reason that some of my spells can be useful and can't get them off if I'm being constantly pounded on.  Also, when not in a dungeon I can have my pet tank for me while I step back for a second and cast.<P>One way NOT to form a group is to invite people then when they arrive at the location they find out you've gone and already filled up the slots.  It happened to me last weekend.  Two guildmates were in Oggok getting ready to hit Cazic.  They invited me to join them but since I was in Neriak I told them to go ahead and I'd meet them inside.  It didn't take me long to get there but when I told them I was on my way in they said "cool" but then said "Oops, got a full group."  I waited for over an hour before logging.  That was a huge waste of time, traveling then not even getting in the group I was invited into.  Not a good way to make friends or influence people.<P>Kaminaa Gix &lt;Innoruuk's Rage&gt;<BR>Teir'Dal SK of the 31st Depth<BR>Master Blacksmith<BR>Master Brewer<BR>Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Have to agree with TheSpike on this one, I'd forgo listing the classes as must but rather the primary function.<P>2 SK can do a fine job tanking (as can any other hybrid) it really depends on tactics used, the best way for to hybrids to tank is using a ping pong tactic. (taunting back and forth between the two)<P>I think any group can be rather good if they know what they are doing, it is however true that at the end game (high level groups and post 50) the basic group set up pretty much has to be as listed above.<P>I've group in many wacky groups though, most notably a group with me as SK and 4 Necros at the Orc camps in EC (note, low level group  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ) We had no trouble breaking and keeping the spawn.<P>The oposite happned too, 2 SK's 2 clerics a ranger and a druid.<BR>Druid harmonied and the hybrids just stomped major togus that night. I don't think any of us got past 4 bubs of health.<P>But I'm babbling again. Just wanted to say that at the rather lower levels group make up doesn't matter that much as long as everyone knosw what they should do in any given situation.<P>And to all those that forgot about us SK's in yer groups... pah who needs ya!

</FONT><HR>In Reply to: Tarnoq<P>So is there a good time for pet usage in a group...?.<P> Actually there is only a few times when I Don’t use a pet. <P>1. One of them is in the Plane of Hate, Never use a pet in Hate unless the leader calls for pets (Usually against Mistro or Inny Only). I do use the Rage of Zomm pet on Spite Golems, but that is another story.<BR>2. I enter a new Dungeon and don’t know the pathing, and I’m with a pick up group. <BR>3. On a large Raid Inside a dungeon <P><BR>And that is about it (That I can think of right now). Outdoors I always have a pet. Inside once I know the pathing enough to control my pet he is always by my side. I have a /pet get lost command as my 0 Hot key. It is far enough away that I don’t accidentally hit it, and yet it is hot keyed on my prim HK page so I don’t have to fumble for it. If my pet does anything erratic and fails to listen to my commands of follow or back off, I don’t think twice. I just kill him with a 0. I know that may sound cruel, but I am an animal lover, and it is really for his own good. =)<P>The situation is a little different for Necros who are grouped with Mages. The Mage pet has a slightly larger attack range then the Necro skeleton, so the necro pet is always closer to the mob and takes more damage. Unless you are using fear (Outdoors) then as a Necromancer grouped with Mage(s) you need to be extra careful with your pet. I’m sure some Necros will confirm this. <P><BR>Tudan  Is absolutely right, I am a crawler. I have spent Most of my life in dungeons. I have never minded dying, and that has a lot to do with it. I gave up the fear of losing my corpse a long time ago, as well as XP loss. Even after losing 55 (My most sought out level) I didn’t mind. I think you can have more fun in the game if you release the fear of corpse and XP loss.<P>Duengon groups don’t have to be so well rounded, but when they are you become amazingly powerful. Last night for example I went to Sebilis, I logged in there was a Cleric who just did the same. I invited him and thankfully he had A lOT of patience. It took me over an Hr. before all group members arrived and we zoned in for the first battle. The group I put together was all people I have never before met or played with except the Warrior that I did know. The group was:<P>1 Warrior 56 - Was the Prime assist<BR>1 Cleric 50  -  Used no healing spell other then Complete Heal (Most efficient healing spell)<BR>1 Ranger 58 - Was the Puller since he was the highest level<BR>1 Wizard 55 - Evacer and Prime nuker<BR>1 Chanter 52 I believe - Prime responsibility AE stun and Mez<BR>1 Mage 55 - Myself. - Prime Malise and Fire Shields<P>Again the group was unstoppable. My mana rarely got below 75%, and we never even came close to losing anyone. So we had the perfect group. Unstoppable we could fight 5 mobs at the same time (Mez) and never even flinch. <P>Now I realize that in the outdoors this group dynamic is not needed. You will notice that in my ‘perfect’ group set up I do not exclude any class. Even when there was a group penalty and I was aware of it I still invited any class. Now that the XP penalty has been removed from the group, there is really no reason to exclude a class. The main foundation of a perfect duengon group really only needs to include a Cleric and a Chanter. You need some tank and on frogs that Hit for over 100 a shot a warrior is the best choice for extended fighting. You can live without nukes, but not on the frogs that have 7,000 Hps and Gate when they are down to 500. They gate get healed and come back with Friends who don’t like to see they frog friends picked on. This is why I included a Wizard in the basic group setup, they have the Nuke and the Evac to get the warriors and Melee out of a dungeon. (In Sebilis and many new dungeon’s the exit is very difficult to get to alive, once you zone in you can’t just turn around and zone out. Evac removes this problem) I included the Warrior in the primary group but As I said in many cases they can be ‘replaced’ with a Ranger, SK, or Pally. It is best to have a warrior as the prim tank and one of those other 3 as the assist etc. <P>Also it is true most of my ‘advice’ is from my knowledge of the high level game. But the thing is, I believe that the sooner you begin exercising this grouping skill the more prepared for later in life you will be.<P>There is not much difference in the High level game as in the mid or low level, there is just a lot less room for error and mistakes are not as easily forgiven. The result is Death and it can happen very quickly when you are fighting Mobs that hit for over 100 - 150+ a Pop x2. Even with 2000+ Hps it doesn’t take much to get killed. <P>ROC, I’m sorry to hear that story. That is extremely poor group planning. I have never let that happen, as soon as someone says they are on the way I tell the group that we got X person on the way and begin work on the next person. In fact we had to wait last night for about 30 minutes (I needed other anyway) for our Enchanter. During that time (About 5 minutes into it) another chanter that I know logged in right in front of us looking for a group. Knowing that I already promised that spot to someone, I did not even consider adding them to the group. <P>I will also agree with you guys on the pre-50 situation being different. Also a factor is outside vs. inside. Outside is a different game then inside. SK’s Pally’s and Rangers can fill the Primarily tank role. They just can’t do it inside as well. This post is to encourage people to start exploring dungeon’s more often. The most important thing about Dungeon hunting is the Proper use of Assist. I will star a new thread for that discussion.<P><BR>[55 Conjurer] Zandar (Human) &lt;Companions of the Gate&gt; ZONE: Bristlebane<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Aye, Dayhel, I haven't personally seen a situation yet where only one class would do for a particular role, which is why I redid his list as roles instead of classes.  Except for the irreplacibility of clerics in some mid-level dungeons; the Tower of Frozen Shadow comes to mind.  If a non-caster dies there without a cleric in the group, they either have to take two boats from Freeport or have a long run from Thurgadin (and blow over 10pp on an invis potion to make it safely through some incredibly dangerous zones).  If the keyholder dies then they're absolutely screwed, binding class or not.<P>I guess I should add, you need a taunting tank in a dungeon, since the taunt skill (if it works) instantly puts the tank at the top of the mob's hate list by a small amount, and a pure caster could die in the time it takes a non-taunter to build up sufficient hate.  I didn't really address that since I'll never be without a warrior in the group when I'm playing my main.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  I believe the only taunters are warrior, paladin, shadowknight, and ranger, yes?<P>My own dungeon resume: Blackburrow, Befallen, Crushbone, Kurn's, Highhold Pass, Unrest, Mistmoore, Upper Guk, Solusek's Eye, Inner Paw, Dalnir, Permafrost, Runnyeye, Frozen Shadow...umm...dang, I'm probably leaving some out.  I just can't seem to stay in one place for long.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/eek.gif"><P>So, now for the big question: why?<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I mean that there are things to consider before even starting to put together a group.  The Powell Doctrine, named for our esteemed Secretary of State, is helpful here.  First, you need a clearly defined goal.  Is it loot?  XP?  A specific item?  exploration?  the cheap thrill of constant risk?  The answers to those questions will determine which dungeon you choose, where you go in the dungeon, the pacing you set, and even fundamental things like whether you stay in one spot and camp a single room or wander around slaughtering as much as possible.<P>Second, you need an exit strategy.  What is the recognizable criteria for when to leave?  How are you going to get out when that time comes?  Is everyone going to have to leave when one person leaves?  This determines whether having a druid or wizzie for evac is a necessity or just a nicety, and also whether you invite people who can't make a commitment of a few hours at least.<P>Finally, you need communication and consensus (I'm not sure that's part of the Powell Doctrine, but I think it is).  Everyone needs to know and agree on the first two considerations.  It is impossible to have a successful group if the members have diametrically opposed goals; for example, the best way to get xp is to not die, so someone whose primary goal is leveling will have severe disagreements with someone whose primary goal is crazy adrenaline-pumping action.  Also, it does no good to make sure you brought an evacer along so that the melees and hybrids wouldn't have to fight their way back out, if she just gates and camps at the end of the night.<P>I love this thread, since I love dungeons.  If I help even just one person have a more rewarding dungeon grouping experience, then it was worth the time of writing this.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cool.gif"><P>Tudan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Tudan,<BR>  I agree with your last assement totaly and you are 100% correct about the dungeons IMHO.  To bad we are not on the same server as we probably would enjoy grouping togeather in the dungeons.  I think I like a combination of the risk/ability to control a section or a whole dungeon/and the normal loot that drops.  Dont get me wrong when you hit the good loot nothing better than rolling gets the juices flowing as you dream on what you are going to do with that loot.  Now of course I try to do rare loot need before greed but sometimes that doesnt always pan out because the group is greedy up front.  Usually changes after the first rare item drops and the greedy person needs it and loses roll.  But I try to avoid those groups if possible its just on my server not counting the newbie dungeons of CB, BB they just not as populated people like the wide open easy exp.  Makes me sad really as when the time comes where you are going to need multiple groups to take on a single main mob the people will not be ready in the playing range I currently reside in.  Which is going to result in alot of unnessary deaths.<P>Well I have rambled long enough I am off today so I will be playing so a response to this probably will not come until next week.<P>Take care happy gaming.<P>Dayhel Pathweaver<BR>Ranger of 38 summers (will make 39 and get sow today)<BR>Terris</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Dayhel As far as your peel off duty goes, until you have a level 49 cleric (Who can restore almost all lost Xp) You will have to play it by ear. I would agree with you that Cleric is first then Chanter. The casters go down fast as well, so whoever is in imminent danger so be considered. That is one way to use assist, but it is not the best way. I have my hotkey set like this (Of course I change the name each time I group)<P> /assist zandar<P>I have this hot keyed into the number 6 spot. So when the puller comes back with 4 mobs and the Prim assist picks one all I have to do I hit the 6 key.  Immediately get the correct target without having to fumble around to target the tank first. Beyond that I have my Sit key set for 5 and my pet attack key is set like this: <P>/pet kill<BR>/say Element of Water attack %T!<P>I have that set to the number 4 key.<P>I have my Malice set to the number 1 hot key and my Malice message:<P>/g %T Is &lt;&lt;Malised&gt;&gt;<P>set to the number 8 key. When in a fight this is all I have to do:<P>645185<P>I literally hit 6 keys and I have assisted, set my pet to attack, stood up, malised, told the group I malised and then sat back down to med. The time it saves makes the difference of life or death many times.  (I’m going to make another thread for this soon) <P><BR>Tuden, I’m glad you have enjoyed this post as much as I have. As far as having such a defined set of tactics, I honestly don’t believe that is always necessary. The last few groups I had we had no definition of a goal at all other then to have fun and stay alive. Many dungeons do not require an Evac as you pointed out. That only really occurs at the higher levels when there is no zone out or it is difficult to get to.<P>Dayhel---- <P>“Makes me sad really as when the time comes where you are going to need multiple groups to take on a single main mob the people will not be ready in the playing range I currently reside in. “<P> This is true. But at that level everyone is expected to know what to do, and using assist as I have shown is not an option, it is the only way it will work. Often the primary assist is not in your group. There is so much action you can not target them, and without using assist as stated above, it can become impossible to get the correct target. Hitting the wrong target results in deaths, starting with your own (And then everyone knows who broke the Mez)<P>Which brings the post back full circle, the reason to start practicing now, is that when the time comes none of my friends from TNZ will be the ones in the situation of not knowing what to do (As I once was).<P>Hunt well this weekend, and if you get a chance give it a shot. No better time then the present to get stated.<P>[55 Conjurer] Zandar (Human) &lt;Companions of the Gate&gt; ZONE: Bristlebane<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Zandar, I've seen as I go up in levels that people need less and less basic communication.  People know their roles, and know what they want, for the most part.  It was probably pretty obvious to anyone getting your invitation what they were being invited for.  However, even in the mid-30's I still see sometimes in a pickup dungeon group where everyone else just wants a little excitement and xp, one person repeating over and over "Let's go do &lt;fill in really nasty room for our level where we would certainly have several deaths or even a TPW but he would get a chance for a no-drop item for a nifty class-specific quest&gt;".  That's a sure recipe for dissatisfaction at the least, disaster at the worst since they often act jittery going partway out of the room trying to get the rest of us to follow (read: possible aggro when we aren't ready), and most often severe inconvience finding a replacement when they get frustrated enough to leave.  And someone else just happened to mention in another thread where they went up to Fear during another raid to prepare for their own -- and ended up bailing out some melees whose evaccer had, in fact, simply gated and camped at the end of the night.  I had just used that as a worst-case scenario of the type that strikes (ironically) fear in my heart, without expecting that anyone would ever do that; but communication never hurts, at any level.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Tudan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Zandar,<BR>   Since VI was so kind as to create multiple extra social keys.  I currently have two assists keys in existance the one you stated in your assist statement and one like your malice statement.  When in an individual group whoever is pulling I target when they go to pull by clicking on there name in the group name box and wait for there return.  When doing multi-group raids on those rare occasions when i can get to one I do use the /assist &lt;name&gt; so I appricate the advise on that and it is definitly (sp) sound advise.  Just glad to see that at least my approach is correct.<P>Dayhel Pathweaver<BR>Ranger of 39 summers<BR>Terris</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum10&number=10&thisthread=005590&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum10&number=10&thisthread=005590&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
