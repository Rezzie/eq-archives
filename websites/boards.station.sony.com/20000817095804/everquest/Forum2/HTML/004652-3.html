</FONT><HR>UO had a solution to camping, although it was players camping other players  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.   I think this could work with EQ and even be automated.<P>What would happen would basically be suddenly a bunch of monsters run in and killed all the PKillers who were 'camping' the dungeon exit.  These were obviously not normal monster encounters.<P>In EQ it could be something similar, or a camp powerspawn.  Example:  Lets say uberguild X has been camping the orc camps in EC for 3 days now.  A GM could 'spawn' a griphon or two to attack the campers.  Everyone dying sure breaks up a player camp.   The second option is a powerspawn, where instead the camp itself starts megga spawning orcs (like 30 or 40), and this time the orcs are not just there to be picked off one at a time.   They spawn withing 1 minute of each other, and they have a target when they spawn (so they just run out).   The programmign could work something like:  If members from any guild N have been at this camp more then T time (8 hours or more) then Spawn Z monsters * Y campers.  Each set of spawned monsters will target a guild member (others who are not part of that group are ignored initally).    The super agro spawns could run for several hours too so if any guild members get close to that camp (much bigger agro radious) then Z monsters will spawn and hunt them down.  I think this could auto-controll those guilds who think own camps or zones (heck the whole zone could turn against them, every moss snake is just itching for a fight with Guild X).<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>In response to the person who replied to me:<P>The PGT also goes for 180-200pp on Prexus.  But these casters had been sitting there for two weeks, faming, then selling (how they kept buyers I'll never know. One would think EVENTUALLY they'd run out and quit farming.  Maybe they were givinh the PGT's to guild members, who knows?).  Thus they were able to charge 250pp because they knew that for the last two weeks, the PGT was coming through THEM.  Would I be mad if I had gotten there and a GM had forced me to share?  No.  Annoyed perhaps.  But at least I would have had a shot at it.<P>After that (and several other bad experiences with farmers) I decided to move to a PvP server.  It's actually pretty nice.  I haven't levelled very far, but I notice many places that were often "camped" for low level xp are totally free (especially orc camps in EC).  I can only hope this remains true at higher levels.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The main reason WHY PnP became necessary is OVERCROWDING.  Verant designed the game for about 1200 to 1500 people on a server.  Last night, there were over 60,000 people on line.  My server, Nameless, usually has well over 2000 on during peak hours, which far exceeds the original 1200 to 1500, and significantly exceeds the revised "target population" of 1800 that Verant posted recently.  <P>Kunark didn't take off as much of the population load as they expected because it's horrible for any non-binding class without a 29+ cleric in the party.  And the lack of (non-deadly, reasonably spaced) TP portals and the fact that it's really 20+ for anyone who isn't playing an Iksar keeps many others from visiting.<P>EQ is designed so that items enter the world at a specific, very slow rate, tailored to that population size.  Only certain items are particularly good and available prior to the Planes in certain body parts for certain classes (Gatorscale sleeves/legs for example).  This makes those items pretty much required, if one wants to have a decently equipped character.<P>Kunark HAS taken some of the pressure off on item camping, by making higher end items available to replace some of the items that used to be the best non-planes items, which are now being passed back out into the world, but it still is far slower than needed.  <P>Some solutions that would have worked better than PnP:<P>A. Up the rate at which items enter the world to accomodate the burgeoning population, or <P>B. Add enough servers to reduce the playerload to the size Norrath was designed for, or<P>C. Make Kunark more accessible so that it becomes less of a ghostland.<P>PS:  I personally think it is ludicrous that if I spend 5 or 10 hours trying to get something to equip one of my characters that someone can just show up and get a 50% chance at it.  Unfortunately there is no way to distinguish someone farming the item from someone trying to equip their own characters.<P>PPS:  THERE NEEDS TO BE AN ALTERNATIVE FOR THE JBOOTS QUEST.  Especially since the item the AC drops is also one of the best caster bracers available.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Just because there are plenty of places to fight doesn't mean any player has the right to say "this is mine, go somewhere else."  Nothing in the game is owned by any player.  Period.  So a spawn site is already crowded and you don't want to share?  Tough luck.  The guy who just walked up to the spawn has the exact same right to fight there as you do.  This first come, it's mine garbage is just that.  Garbage.  So the game is crowded and you don't want to share your camp?  Tough, the game is crowded for everyone.

</FONT><HR>In Highkeep (at least on the Tribunal server), there is a "list" system. It's a system that's in use elsewhere, but for those unfamiliar with it, I'll explain.<P>There's three main "camps" in HK: The guard room, the war room, and the raider room. The group leader in each of those rooms is responsible for keeping a list. When you enter the zone, you can ask "Who's keeping the warrior room list?" and eventually you'll get an answer (as long as the war group isn't fighting at the time, of course). The leader of that group will put you on the list. First come, first serve. The person who's first on the list gets the first open slot in the group. So as one player leaves the group, the next one on the list fills the slot that's vacant.<P>That accomplishes several things: <P>#1, It keeps the hunting areas from being horribly overcrowded. It ensures that only one group at a time is competing for a particular room. <P>#2, It provides a method of ensuring a full group which is utterly necessary since those are difficult spawns.<P>#3, It provides a method for sharing, albiet in a line-up-in-the-queue sort of way.<P>HOWEVER, under the PnP rules, some yahoo could walk into the zone, go to the warrior room, and demand to have access to the war spawn right then and there, bypassing those who are courteous enough to get on the list and wait their turn. They could invoke a GM to come and force people who are voluntarily cooperating to yeild to someone who is NOT willing to cooperate with the rest of the players. In this sort of situation, the PnP actually promotes antisocial behavior rather than encouraging it.<P>The PnP policy fails over and over again to do what it was supposedly desgined to do. That's why I suggested an alternative to the PnP in one of my other posts. 99.9% of the players who want to see the PnP abolished do so because they want to see things made MORE fair, not less fair. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Lucy, I think that the PnP system works exactly as it should in this case.  I understand how the HK system works and it's wrong.  Why?  Because it's EXACTLY the reason that Verant implemented the PnP rules in the first place.  Making up a list of people and allowing them to rotate in when other people leave is not the way Verant wants the game played, and neither do the majority of players.  That's called monopolizing a spawn, and it stinks.  The only way people are allowed into the rotation is when someone decides to leave.  I don't pay $9.95 a month, just like everyone else in the game, so I can wait around until some guy decides he's done fighting.  I'll make this very clear, and this is what Verant has already stated:  Anyone who walks up to a camp has the right to be put into the rotation IMMEDIATELY.  That DOESN'T mean they get to skip people on the list, or move ahead of anyone who is waiting.  It means that they get to fight after the LAST person there gets their turn.  What is wrong with that??  <P>People think that if there are already 6 people there, the spawn should be closed to new people, so they don't have to share xp.  Sorry, but just because the servers are overcrowded doesn't give anyone a right to close down a spawn and claim ownership.  The servers are crowded for everyone and I don't know where in the world people think that first come gives them entitlment.  I repeat, NO ONE gets to walk up and start fighting at a spawn out of turn under PnP rules.  All they do is force groups to let new people into the rotation immediately upon arriving, in a FAIR and appropriate order to when they arrived.  Why is that so hard to comprehend.  No one is being cheated.  No one gets to fight out of order.  I have seen a full rotation used with 15 people in the old days and no one had a problem.  If you have a problem with too many people being in a rotation at a spawn then complain to Verant about overcrowding or go to another spawn.  You don't get the right to force people to wait on a list until you decide you're done fighting.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Kidz,<P>I'm not sure where people always pull the "the majority of the players feel this way or that".  Was it a poll, is it your gut feeling?<P>Well, if you can say it, I can say it.  I KNOW that most of the people have a great disdain for the "forced rotation" part of the PNP.  In fact, those that invoke PNP are held with contempt and disdain by their peers.  <P>Look at my post on page 2 I think, and you'll see how the actuall application of this forced rotation actually works out.  <P>I will state again.  I have played since Beta and NEVER have there been a time when I could not find a spot to hunt.  Sure, does this mean that I had to look, or maybe I didn't get the hunting spot I wanted everytime I was on, because god forbid, someone else was there first?<P>PNP as it applies to forced rotation is the tool of the greedy, demanding and impatient.  They want that spawn and they want it NOW!!  And if you don't give it to them, they'll complain to a GM, which will force a shared spawn.<P>Like I tell my kids...patience, you'll get your turn when the other child is done.

</FONT><HR>If the list system sucks so bad, then why is it that I've never heard anyone complain about it? People log out and leave the group a lot more often than you think. When it's excessively crowded, I may have waited for 2 hours. Usually it's only about half an hour. But I'd rather be able to go do something else for 2 hours and know that when I do get into a group at HK, I'll be hunting non-stop. It's a lot better for everyone that way because in your method I might only wind up getting one out of every TWELVE spawns. With the list system, I only have to wait a short while and then I get in on every single spawn thereafter until I leave.<P>Nobody complains about it because the system works. Sure, it sucks to have to wait a while, but it's not as bad as you think. It's fun to go out into the pass and help newbies sometimes, so there's always something to do while you wait.<P>I think the people who are in favor of the PnP really just don't understand that the only thing it accomplishes is making people resent each other. People who invoke the PnP on me get on my idiot list for sure. I do NOT monopolize spawns, and I readily share everything I can. But the fact is, letting 15 people whack away at 3 orcs is stupid. Better that 4 or 5 should have the spawn exclusively and the others toddle off to find something else to do or wait their turn.<P>Frankly, if I come across a spawn that's already camped, I ask to get in the group and if I can't I move on. It's just that simple. And I expect the same courtesy from other players when it's my turn to get a chance at the spawn. And believe me, eventually everyone goes get a chance. Play at 7am on a  Sunday morning and you'll have so many spawns all to yourself that you won't know what to do with them all. <P>People who insist on trying to share spawns in overcrowded areas during peak playing times get what they deserve.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Kidf, not that it matters much, but I have already had a GM state that a "list" was enough to satisfy them as far as "sharing" goes. You get in on the back of the list, and as people leave, the list moves up. Sorry if that does not work into what YOU feel is the way it should go. Remember, before you go saying the same old..."I pay my $9.95 blah blah" that other people are paying too, and have just as much right to stuff as you do, just because you pay also does not mean you can do anything you want.  Also, I don't think "Most" players like having PnP policy enforced, but "I"I can see where sometimes it is needed. If there is already a list, I do not think that it is necessary.

</FONT><HR>-"I have played since Beta and NEVER have there been a time when I could not find a spot to hunt."<P>I never said there was nowhere to hunt.  I asked what you think gives you right to take a spawn site and tell everyone else to go away?  Why don't you go somewhere else to hunt?  Where does it say first come gets the spawn?  Answer: It doesn't.  Verant said so with the PnP rules and you just don't like it. sorry<P>-"PNP as it applies to forced rotation is the tool of the greedy, demanding and impatient. They want that spawn and they want it NOW!! "<P>Really?  Arriving at a spawn and asking to be put into a rotation in the order that you arrived is greedy??  How is it demanding to get a spawn "NOW", when all the person is asking is to be put into the rotation in a fair, and as-arrived order?  That makes no sense at all, except from someone who never learned to share as a child and only knows, "mine, mine,  mine."<P>-"Sharing is waiting your turn, not grabbing the toy from the other kid because you think you deserve it NOW!Sharing is waiting your turn, not grabbing the toy from the other kid because you think you deserve it NOW!"<P>Hmmm.  I don't think you understand Pnp.  It means you get put into the rotation in the order you arrived.  How many more times can I say this.  It doesn't say you get precedence over the people who were already there.  Period.  You get the opportunity to fight in the order that people arrived.  You have to be rotated into the fighting in a fair manner.  That's ALL.  What part of that do you not understand??<P>-"It's a lot better for everyone that way because in your method I might only wind up getting one out of every TWELVE spawns."<P>First off, it's not my method.  It's the way game was always played until powercamping took over.  And it's now officially Verant's method for playing the game.  Secondly, if you don't like the fact that spawns are crowded and you might only get one in 12 pops, I'm sorry.  It sucks.  That's life.  Your answer means the following; you get every single spawn while you're in the group and the other people waiting on the list get nothing.  They just need to run around and find something else to do while you monopolize the spawn.  How is that fair?  How is it fair if there is someone farming items in the group who doesn't want to leave, and can stay on-line for 20 hours? Under your system 6 people can stay in the group for 10 hours in a row and the people on the list are SOL.  This is EXACTLY why Verant made the PnP rules.  What if people don't have 2 hours to wait on a list?  What if they just want to get into the rotation for a couple of kills?  Your solution rewards powercampers and farmers for sitting around trying to own spawns, and I say HOORAY to Verant for trying to stop you.<P>-"But the fact is, letting 15 people whack away at 3 orcs is stupid."<P>Sorry.  It's a crowded game.  That doesn't give you the right to monopolize it because you don't like waiting for everyone to get a turn.<P>-"I have already had a GM state that a "list" was enough to satisfy them as far as "sharing" goes. You get in on the back of the list, and as people leave, the list moves up."<P>I'm sorry, but the GM was wrong.  PnP rules clearly state that you have the right to immediately be put into a rotation.  Waiting on a list for people to leave the group is 100% antithetical to the PnP rules and you were given false information.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well, I may get flamed but.....<P>{Disclamer - a quick thought about the issue -- this is not a completely thoughtout process...}<P>A possible 'fix' that addresses what I've seen complaints wise is possible but would require some code to support from Verent.<P>Basically if I understand correctly it boils down to the sharing of a 'camp' or 'object' or 'mob'.<P>Perhaps to fix all the issues they could implement an in-code solution.<P>1. Determine the number of 'camps', 'objects', or 'mobs' that need to be specifically identified as contested in each zone.    {lets say that is 10 for OOT - just for example, with #1 being the Ancient Cyclops}<P>2. Each zone would have a 10 space table called 'camps' that a player could place a 'reserve' spot into.   <P>command:<P> /reserve_objects<BR>     -- lists the reserve objects you can tag<P>     results:   1 - Ancient Cyclops<BR>                2 - object 2<BR>                3 - mob 3<BR>               ...and so on<P> /reserve<BR>    -- shows player the current reserve object if any that they are tagged for<P>     results:   None.<BR>                -or-<BR>                You are in queue for #1 - Ancient Cyclops.<P> /reserve 1<BR>     -- player adds their request to be next in list for reserve object 1<P> /reserve 1 clear<BR>     -- remove the reserve marker for player<P> /reserve 1 show<BR>     -- show where you are in the 'rotation'<P>     results: <BR>         You are 5th in the rotation for #1 Ancient Cyclops.<P>     note:  Do not show any info of whoelse is in rotation  --- reason will be apparent later I hope<P>==<BR>NOTES:  <P>Zoning (including dying) removes you from the reserve list -- you have to start over in the rotation (I think that is fair)<P>The 'reserve' command also looks at Guild tags.  If you are in a guild then the WHOLE guild gets that rotation allocation.  It won't matter if a guild gets 100 individuals there - they all share the roation.   If you reserve and then join a guild (added) it CLEARS your reserve.   This still won't address guilds disbanning for the reserves but that may be addressable????   If your guild already has an entry in the reserve table then you simply get auto-assigned that reserve ranking.<P>Grouping after you do a reserve simply removes all the reserves from the group members except for the lowest numbered one and gives you each that new reserve ranking.   Leaving the group *CLEARS* your reserve marker --- you have to start over waiting.<P><BR>BIG NOTE:<P>Code is added to the 'camp', 'object', or 'mob' event that "pops" the reserve stack when the main goal or event occurs or is accomplished.  This way the next one can be notified as follows (anywhere in the zone):<P>   "You hear noises from afar that sound like a thunderous crashing -- it is getting closer!"<P>In other words you get a in-game/in-context message that indicates it is your 'turn' to hit that reserve area/item.<P>Now this is VERY rough and probably gonna cause serious flaming but it is a suggestion as it would give the CustomerService group ZERO problems with determining who is 'next' for things.    Verant would be able to control what they consider a 'full cycle' that they can enforce the rotations/Play-nice for.....<P>Here is the (hopefully good) kicker -- ANYONE can help combat the reserved mobs --- however, only the '1' ranking will get XPs and have LOOT RIGHTS.  Period.   End of discussion.   This addresses the KS'ers, the groups wanting to help others 'play through quickly' and so on.   It still allows 'roleplaying', 'guild grouping', and all the other forms of co-operative playing without penalizing those trying to accomplish the quest or mob.<P><BR>Issues:<P>Still means that the timings and appearences of the rare mobs will be 'advertised' because of the way the reserve/rotation triggering would work but is that still an issue/concern?<P>Guilds 'de-guilding' 100 people to get the next 100 reserves....not sure how to handle that other than keep a field in the player record of "Previous_Guild_Member"......<P>=========<BR>&lt;whew&gt;  Now that I've jumped in with both feet what do you think?

</FONT><HR>Great ideas on the in-game system.  Nice to see someone who has solutions rather than "Pnp sucks, it's for idiots."  I'm not sure about the specifics of how the system could be implemented, or how Verant would feel about any changes you mentioned.  I know they would have some problems with the roleplaying aspect of having you officially on "lists" to fight monsters.  Might be an issue.  It also seems like it would be way too much code for them to track static camps in each zone and keep a dynamic list of who is in line for the spot.  Again, it's a great idea, and I'm not knocking it, but I'm guessing it's probably an EQ2 type of thing.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>KidF: &gt;&gt;&gt;as it should in this case. I understand how the HK system works and it's wrong. Why? Because it's EXACTLY the reason that Verant implemented the PnP rules in the first place.&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>This assertion, although emphatic, is incorrect.  Please read Abashi's comments in this thread on why the PnP system was implemented.  It was because of tightly-knit groups (the uberguild is the oft used example) locking the rest of the server population out of a spawn indefinitely.  Rotating people into a group of 6, with an open invitation policy, is absolutely not the system the PnP was designed to prevent.  I would argue this is a great example of groups being social in the best spirit of the game.  There exists a certain point at which additional members on a spawn don't make sense.  Once a spawn is so well handled that a group could easily lose 2-3 members to selling or link death, and still maintain the spawn, adding more is worse than pointless: It's destructive of the efficiency of everyone present.<P>KidF: &gt;&gt;&gt;Making up a list of people and allowing them to rotate in when other people leave is not the way Verant wants the game played, and neither do the majority of players. That's called&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>I don't see any basis for your claim about Verant's position.  And have you polled the majority of players to make the second part of your claim?  My perception is exactly the opposite: Most people are happy with a rotation into a group of 6.  I offer this proof: Go to major camp points: the treants of SK, the druids of EK, the centurions of EC, etc etc, and watch the people there.  You will see this system in process, and working.  People walk up, they ask to get on list, the leader says "Ok, you are number X", and the person will say even say 'thank you', and then wander off.  People realize that maxing out the group of six is the standard and the best approximation of a fair 'system' that can be consistently imposed to handle the delicate balance of sharing versus inefficient camp overkill.<P>KidF: &gt;&gt;&gt;monopolizing a spawn, and it stinks. The only way people are allowed into the rotation is when someone decides to leave.&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>To be clear, we are talking here about getting into the group, not getting into the 'rotation'.  At least, that's what I'm talking about.  I almost never see anyone actually rotate a spawn, simply because it's so much easier to kill a MOB with a group, and Verant gives that XP bonus for grouping.<P>KidF: &gt;&gt;&gt;I don't pay $9.95 a month, just like everyone else in the game, so I can wait around until some guy decides he's done fighting. I'll make this very clear, and&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>Everyone else pays their $10 a month and the majority clearly feel this is the best system.  If this wasn't the best system, it wouldn't be the most prevalent, would it?  Strangers would not consistently agree to a system if they thought some other system was superior, would they?  More proof that you are in the minority on this issue.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;People think that if there are already 6 people there, the spawn should be closed to new people, so they don't have to share xp. Sorry, but just because the servers are overcrowded doesn't give anyone a right to close down a spawn and claim ownership.&lt;&lt;&lt;<P>If there are 6 people at treants, go hunt somewhere else.  There's no need for a 7th, it just wastes everyone's time.  (In my opinion 6 is vast overkill, but somewhere you have to draw the line, and since EQ limits groups to 6, the line is easiest to draw there.)  The servers aren't so overcrowded that there is nowhere else to hunt.  It's just that people are lazy: They've hunted at the treants before, and they don't feel like hunting somewhere else.  PnP was not designed to give free MOBs to the lazy.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Just to put things in context, here is the Play Nice rule (#3) from http://everquest.station.sony.com/s_conduct.html<P>-----<BR>There are cases where two or more groups wish to kill the same thing. In these cases, the groups are required to compromise.<BR>-----<P>There is more, but this is the gist of it.  Abashi has also observed that he is open to suggestions so long as they do not require additional GM staff.  Clearly, the overall goal from Verant is to create an environment which is primarily self-governing.  All they want is for us to be able to reach a compromise-- they are NOT saying that anyone can walk up to a spawn and take it (that is well covered by rule #1.)<P>There are many in-game compromises going on.  Some of the popular ones are the group member rotation, waiting lists, spawn alternation, rolling for spawns, etc.  If someone comes up and says you MUST do XXX because of the Play Nice rules, they are wrong.  All you have to do is reach a compromise.  Refer them back to the website or quote the rule verbatim while offering to reach a compromise.<P>Now, negotiation can be difficult, particularly if the other person has the advantage in level, firepower, friends, etc.  Running to the GM is clearly a final option given the reqirement to compromise.  (If I were the GM, I'd be seriously inclined to just boot both parties out of the zone for each dispute unless one party were clearly willing to compromise and one clearly was not.)  Let the OTHER guy call the GM-- you can say "I was trying to compromise with him, and then you showed up."  NOT calling the GM shows that you are trying to live up to the Play Nice rules.  Be prepared to continue negotiations and show how you are willing to compromise.<P>If other people in the zone have spoken with you and already reached a compromise (e.g. the waiting list) encourage them to speak up and show how they already reached a compromise with you.<P>THE MOST IMPORTANT THING is to show a high level of maturity in your dealings.  In any negotiation both parties are going to feel equally strongly that they are in the right.  The trick is to find something that both can agree to.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

But the absolute worse case of exploitation of the play nice rules that I have seem is when a group breaks a difficult spawn and is then forced to share with a solo player that could never have gotten in by themselves.

</FONT><HR>According to Gordon, breaking the spawn, despite the sacrifice and the work done by the original group has no bearing on forced rotation PNP policy.  The only factor that matters is, Can the guy who wants to "demand spawn rotation" get there?  If he can make it to the spawn, he can force a rotation.  That's the rules according to Abashi.  <P>I guess we should be thankful that they at least have to get there (to the spawn) on their own, and we don't have to come pick them up somewhere if they want a forced rotation on any spawn hehe.  Look at the bright side  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Note:  I simply can't stand it when a full group dies, sacrifices, works hard to break a spawn, and then we're forced to equally share it with one guy, and the GM's enforce it as such.

</FONT><HR>Some of the older(as in playing eq) players miss one important point:  Some of the players are totally brand new to the game and don't know where everything is at. <P>I just started playing  5 months ago and I only know about 1/4th of all the mobs, areas, items, etc..  Alot of players fall into this category.  So the "there are plenty of places go and get xp" statement falls short when it comes to new players.  You can't expect everyone to be in an established guild at level 1 and guided by players with dozens of characters.  Yes there are places to go, but alot of the mobs carry heavy faction(good guy) hits and not being able to enter a city because you are KOS sucks. So the mobs that don't have/worthless faction hit are favorite targets especially for newbies.<P>Also one poster tried to compare game PnP rules with real life milk duds and said that players don't need Spawns in this game.  Ok einstein how else you going to level?  Oh we don't NEED xp from spawns we can find another way to level. Oh by turning in quest items? Well you got to get those from mobs/spawns. Oh since we don't NEED spawns I guess you going to buy the quest items, so how are you going to come up with the money for them? Well since we don't NEED spawns to give us loot I guess you will be one of the nuisences and beg for money. Oh going to have your guild do all the work for you, how long do you think any rational person would do that. As far as your milk dud nonsense goes..   EQ version: You are camping the mob that drops the milk duds, you don't own the mob that drops the milk duds so yes you must share that spawn with player Danny if asked.  RL version:  Danny must know you from somewhere and the only way he knows you have milk duds is that you showed them to him.  He went to your mom since either she likes him or is good friends with parents so yes you are going to give up some milk duds.  If you are under 18 and living with parents whatever you think is yours actually is theirs anyway.<P>The PnP rules aid the casual gamer, the newbie players, and force guilds to actually let non-guilders get items that they were farming and selling on ebay.<P>Have I used them?  Yes several times under 40th level, though not how it was described in previous posts.  If someone politely asks if they can either join the group so they too can get xp/item and/or asks to share the spawn and is given a rude response in return then yes I would bring up PnP.  Do I care if I get blacklisted by guilds?  No if their members are that petty then that guild isn't worth joining or dealing with. I am not interested in losing days of game play to risk slaying 1 stupid dragon. <P>The only way to fix it PnP is to actually have the GMs/guides quickly enforce it.  Sometimes when there are gms on(alot of times there isn't) and it takes 30-90 RL minutes for them to get to you and by then either you got tired of waiting and moved on feeling exasperated, the person whom you petitioned against moved on adding you to their "blacklist", etc.. and when they do get you its oh well maybe I can get to it quicker next time.  This gives some players enough reason(in their minds) to become spawn stealers, which does nothing but cause headaches for everyone in the zone. So I believe quick and forceful action by the gms will help matters immensely.<P>I personnally feel the players should have their account suspended a set amount of time per PnP offense. example; 1st offense = 1 day, 2nd offense = 3 days, etc.. and after 30 days or so reset it.  If there are many proven offenses maybe its time Verant had that person look into acquiring a different game.<P>James</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>MKnightmare-"This assertion, although emphatic, is incorrect. Please read Abashi's comments in this thread on why the PnP system was implemented. It was because of tightly-knit groups (the uberguild is the oft used example) locking the rest of the server population out of a spawn indefinitely."<P>I don't read anything in his posts that says the Pnp was implemented was created because people were locked out of a spawn indefinitely.  He said, "The play nice policies, in regards to spawns and camping, are designed to promote equal access to the areas."  How do I have equal access if I'm told to wait on a list until someone decides they are done fighting.  The only difference between what HK does and what an Uberguild does is that one is organized under the banner of a guild, and the other is organized by a self elected person at the spawn site who maintains a list.  In each case the spawn is dominated by a single group until they are done fighting and want to open up the spawn to other people.  That is why I said this was exactly what the PnP rules are there to prevent.  These "lists" are just smoke and mirrors for groups to pretend like they're making an effort to work within the PnP policies when they are not. If you don't think so please tell me the difference in this hypothetical:<P>#1: An uberguild takes a spawn and claims no one else can fight there.  For 4 hours they don't allow anyone into the rotation and kill everything that spawns.<P>#2:  A group of 6 strangers takes a spawn at HK and starts a list.  For 4 hours they all fight there, killing everything that spawns and no one logs off.  No one else made it into the "rotation" because no one left the group.<P>Exactly how are these different aside from some kind of semantic nitpicking you want to throw around??  The result, which is precisely why PnP was started, IS EXACTLY THE SAME in both situations.  Do you think the player who is locked out of the spawn for those 4 hours really cares what your reasons are for doing it??  Are they supposed to cry and sympathize with you because the game is crowded and you didn't want to let anyone else in on the rotation??<P>-"There exists a certain point at which additional members on a spawn don't make sense."<P>Doesn't make sense for who?? You mean it doesn't make sense for the people fighting because they don't want to get put into a long rotation.  Again, it's overcrowded.  Sorry.  It doesn't mean you get to lock people out of the spawn because it's crowding your play time.  We both pay the same $9.95, and if I'm going to be on a list so are you.<P>-"I don't see any basis for your claim about Verant's position."<P>Since we're debating the PnP rules and I think they are fairly clearly stated, I have every basis for stating what Verant's position is.  It is there in black and white for you to read.  I'm sorry if you don't like the rules or don't agree with them, but I'm not going to nitpick with you about what Verant's position is.  Go read it for yourself.<P>-"I almost never see anyone actually rotate a spawn, simply because it's so much easier to kill a MOB with a group, and Verant gives that XP bonus for grouping."<P>Yes, people don't rotate anymore because they came to feel that they owned camps and it's a hard habit to break.  Again, exactly why Verant started the PnP policy.  You don't own a camp and you don't have any right to it, even if 100 people want to rotate in.  Over a year ago, almost every spawn I went to was evenly rotated into no matter how many people were there.  You're obviously either fairly new or inexperienced, because you also are under the myth that there is a bonus for grouping.  This is one of the oldest myths in EQ, and it's totally false.<P>-"If there are 6 people at treants, go hunt somewhere else. "<P>If you feel that having more than 6 people in the rotation is too crowded, YOU go somewhere else.  Since the policy is that you HAVE to allow people who show up at a camp into the rotation, why do you assume that those people have to find somewhere else to hunt?  I think you're a little mixed up.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

In a contested spawn between two parties if <BR>  (a) both parties would recieve xp from the said spawn they must share it.<BR>  (b) one party would recieve xp and one wouldn't the party that would recieve xp gets a 2:1 preference in the spawn.<BR>  (c) neither party would get xp they split the spawn.<P>2.  Ruling regarding "broken" spawns.<BR>  If a party has "broken" a spawn in a dungeon which is particularly hard they can only be "forced" to share the spawn with a group of similar or higher level composition.<P>3.  Ruling regarding "rare" spawns<BR>  The splitting of spawns is discretionary except for the sought after "rare" spawn which must be shared equally regardless of if in fact it drops said item or not.<P>Basically this is the way I have seen most guides work out most issues, but there are times that, well, they dont live up to their normal standards of excellence shall we say</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Ya the person that just logged in pays as much as I do.  Usually I have waited on the list for an hour to get in and fight.  Should another group get in on the spawn and halve my xp, loot, and say that I wasted my time being nice?  No, I pay as much as THEM hehe.  This is just a symptom of overcrowding.  With the no list argument, it would create an endless loop of people fighting in a spot for maybe a spawn and getting kicked out just to have the next group kicked out and so on.  If the dungeon is already FULL why bother invoking PnP?

</FONT><HR>PnP is either about EXP or items.<P>If it is about exp, then 90% of the time people will share from what I have seen with several characters ranging from level 50, 35, 17, and on down. <P>In general I have no issue with PnP in this circumstance. I do have issue with the one example about the frogluk king. No one has to help anyone in this game that isn't in their group, period. Secondly if a soloing player is forcing a spawn with a full group they should get one in 7 not not one for one. Perhaps that is where the group mentioned goofed. They should have offered 1 kill for the mage, 1 kill for the necro per 1 kill for each group member, aka 6 for them and 2 for the pnp abusers. Then when a GM showed up they would have made an equitable offer to share the spawn.<P>PnP for items. Curiously I have to say that the monopolization issue was limited by the most part to only a select few servers as an on-going problem. Also within PnP it addresses this another way, the "serial" guild. Guilds that continually use their vast ranks to bully other groups is addressed in PnP or was addressed in the original version. If this is a guild issue, aka holding a spawn until they get 24 fbss's for example, then why is the rule forced upon the vast majority of servers which rarely if ever forced this option? This is an issue of farming.<BR> <P>PnP wouldn't be needed if some of the ideas that came from this message boards would be implemented at a faster rate. PnP for experience I think is mostly handled by the players not the GM's. Most work out a deal amoung themselves.<P>1. Make Quests more viable. This has happened somewhat already with newer quests but older ones need to be looked at again. Why should for example 2 fangs for the EBW spawn in the same place everytime? This encourages camping and leads to fights.<P>2. Trade skills need a near total revamp. If we didn't have to camp for better armor and weapons then why would we care about named mobs? We would be back to adventuring for exp, not equipment. If a dungeon gets crowded no one is going to fight over the next ghoullord or frenzy if a smith can make a procing weapon or a tailor can make a haste item!<P>3. What is the difference in camping the AC for X number of hours or raising X number of funds to purchase jboots? In reality if it took 10k to buy them as an alternative to camping the ring then it gives people an option and lessens the tensions over named rare mobs of this nature.<P>4. No drop on high level items. This happens already with certain armor and weapons. Do we have people camping hate and fear to sell and trade off higher end equipment? NO! because it is no drop. If it wasn't then the fights would be a lot worse than they are now which usually boils down to loots rights and schedule conflicts between raid parties. I am not for wide sweeping changes making tons of things no drop but I do think a few more wouldn't hurt on some items such as the better common drops like the crown of the frogluk king.<P>Finally I have to say that it is no doubt in my mind that PnP for items has to do with the way EQ is designed, levels are GoDs but AC and equipment is king. You can't change the level thing, that is fair. But then again we can't change the item issue this late in the game. I only hope VI as well as other game makers learn from this horrid mistake and then next similar game puts less dependance upon items.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hello all. Just thought i would leave my opinion on this subject. (not that it counts for much) I don't camp. I think that people that do camp are playing the game in a way that was not intended. it is ok for them but not the way i play. If i come to a spawn and it is camped i ask if i can get next spawn. If they say no i go on. But, when i am looking for an item for MY character and the spawn is camped i will expect to be put into rotation. I take one kill and my chances on if it has the item then i move on. And one more thing, because i have a job and a family should i lose out on a spawn because some slacker living off his parents is playing the game for 20 to 30 hours at a time and can sit and camp a spawn? I play when time permits and expect to be able to hunt for items that i can use when i play. This has been said before but i pay my $10 a month just like the campers, or their parents in some cases. Good hunting.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Squirrel, I'm not sure if you (or the other campers here) understand how a rotation works.  You said: "Usually I have waited on the list for an hour to get in and fight. Should another group get in on the spawn and halve my xp, loot, and say that I wasted my time being nice? No, I pay as much as THEM hehe."  If you play with a normal rotation as PnP dictates, NO ONE (you included) has to sit on arbitrary lists waiting for people to leave or losing xp as you say.  It's all dictated by the number of players at the spawn and the spawn rate.  Seems to me that is the way the game was designed.  Let me explain, as it's rather simple:<P>Rotation system:<P>There are 10 people at a spawn waiting to fight.  There is an informal "list".  The person who has been there the longest is next up when the spawn pops.  The person who came last goes last.  Therefore, by the time 10 creatures have spawned everyone has had a shot at one kill.  If more or less people show up the list is adjusted.  No one is told to go away.  No one owns the camp.  It's a dynamic, absolutely fair way to play the game. The last person to arrive  is always last in line. Why do you powercampers not understand that?  No one is stealing your camp.  They're only getting their fair shot.  It's just like queing up at a movie theater.  <P>Instead, you have people who want to own a camp or create these exclusive lists.  This is more like a nightclub.  They'll let  a certain amount of people in at a time, depending on whether or not someone leaves.  If it's busy you'll have to wait a long time to get in, and you're at the whims of the other people playing.  If no one leaves you can sit there all night waiting and you won't get in.<P>Which systems seems more fair to you??</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The list systems is used in most popular spots on Bertoxx.  It is a player created system to address overcrowding that allows a sense of fairness without dilluting experience and enjoyment.  In essense, it does work.  95% of the players I encounter have no problem with this system.  <P>I have been on both sides of it.  I usually play two to three hours a night.  Some nights, I get on the list and I don't get called in the time I am on.  Other nights, I get called within ten minutes of submitting my name to the list.  I never have difficulty finding other things to hunt while I wait for a group.  On rare occasions when I do, I work on trade skills.<P>In the HighKeep example, take the Warrior Room.  It does not support two groups of six camping the spawns.  For one thing, the room would be so crowded you couldn't even move!  <P>I was working a character up through HighKeep recently, and was in the Guard Room with her. Our group DID have another group come down and want to "share the spawns".  When that group was bored with the slow experience, they told the Lookout Room they wanted to "share their spawns" too!  I'm sorry, it was abusive and yet it was supported by the GMs.  <P>Overall, I think PnP is a good thing in spirit, but the letter of the law leaves alot of room for abuse.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>PnP is a good idea.  It combats camping.  It promotes the exploration of less crowded areas.  It allows casual players to enjoy areas normally controlled by uber-guilds.  It creates a level playing field for all the players at all times.<P>Now if someone demands you share a spawn when you've only been there an hour or two, that's utter BS and you should tell them this.  But if you are habitually camping the same spawn for more than four hours a day multiple days a week, I think it's time to give other people a shot and see a bit more of the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004652-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004652.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004652-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/004652-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004652&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=004652&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
