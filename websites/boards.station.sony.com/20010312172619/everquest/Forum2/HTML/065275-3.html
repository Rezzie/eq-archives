</FONT><HR>As far as other nerfing on cleric items goes.  The cleric arms and paly helm were nerfed along with all the other buff like spells by increasing their casting times.  It used to be so fast you could manastone down and heal yourself right back up or a Paly could root a mob and heal himself back to full and go after it again.  <P>As far as suggesting what to put on the new BP's... well Absor if CE is too powerful because of 300 hp per tick what is acceptable?  I mean how many people can bandage a person at one time?  Can now 5 people bandage that one fighter for 250 points per tick at a 200 skill?  Does that need to be nerfed.  I know let 12 people bandage someone for 600 per tick.  <P>WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE.... you want to know our responses to this?  If you keep the BP in line with all the other spell effect on other items they are all under level 50.  SO make it Celestial Healing (level 44) instead of Celestial Elixir but lower the damn times again.<P>Lets not follow the same lines as the Res stick and give a lower level cleric the chance to use a spell they would normally not be able to cast by making it over level 50.  That was simpley wrong and should never have been done.<P>Follow the same rules you put out there for every other classes items and you shouldn't have this issue.  Quit nerfing stuff that broke the standard in the first place.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>And another thing.... quit focusing on the equipment and give us something decent in our spell lines and class that is useable.<P>Today - Hammer line spells,<BR>useless weapons for a NON-MELEE class.<BR>Tomorrow - Equipable rangeslot items that increase resistances until zoning and losing the item(s).<BR>quote - has anyone even cast these spells since level 9?<P>Today - higher level "efficient" buffs (less power, longer duration)<BR>Tomorrow - higher level "more powerful" buffs (more power, longer duration)<BR>quote- A level 52 spell should not be the most powerful buff until level 60.<P>Today - Bane of the Undead my arse.  Most powerful undead spell blasts the corpse with the loot.  Real good VI... random mob loot drops now and you want us to nuke the corpse?<BR>Tomorrow - leave the damn corpse please! How about an aura of undead protection (bard like radius), more undead line spells to give us a variety other than nuke.  How about an upgrade to our dot?<BR>quote - Usless against undead... I sure wouldn't be affraid of a cleric.<P>Today - Death pact line of spells is useless for its chance of actually working.<BR>Tomorrow - this line of spells was a great idea now make the spells work.  Give us 2 upgrades that have a snow balls chance in Solb of going off.<BR>quote - who dropped the ball on this one?<P>Today - Mark of Karn<BR>Tomorrow - MAKE IT USEFULL AGAIN.<BR>quote - how can you say this was too powerful and be thinking what a cleric bp is going to be able to have that wouldn't be.<P>Today - Fear spells<BR>Tomorrow - maybe when they get scared eventually the DONT WANT TO COME BACK.  How about a line that ends up with a combined atone spell that has a chance the mob will lose his hate list.<BR>quote - I know I sure don't go back for more when I am forced to run by a source so powerful I don't have a choice.<P>Today - Group Healing Lines....<BR>Tomorrow - Group Celestial Healing Lines.  The number of times a group CH has actually been used during combat is probably coutable on one finger and considering the new agro rules for healing the last thing the cleric will EVER DO, and certainly never again. <BR>quote - yea its efficient only efficient to use when there are 4 tanks who all take damage evenly and in that use would build up how much agro?  4 tanks nowadays is an average of what 4k each when buffed?  so say 3k times 4? 12k hp of agro... guess who is dead?<P>What does that leave left that is actually useful and doesn't need some kinda twink? <P>Today - Stuns...<BR>Tomorrow - actually not too bad the way they are... I'd just rather see them not do damage and just have variable stun lengths with adjusted mana costs instead of doing damage.<BR>quote - I need mana for healing... no need for damage... give us variety.<P>and now onto some interesting skills and new spells....<P>How about being able to bless bandages... with cure poison, cure disease.<P>Lets bring the gods into it... how about spells that work better on worshipers of the same god. Or spells that can only be cast on worshipers of the same god.  Its already in the game for smithing.  Add some new spells with these checks on them.... let those spells stack with existing ones.<P>Let us bless the food and water that is carried so that you get an extra point of regen, or increased resistance to poison and disease, ect... ect...<P>I have said most of this before but geez FIX the Class and quit playing around with all the ITEMS!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;"Lastly, this made me laugh that someone who plays a cleric in game decided what the effect would be, lol. What were you guys thinking putting someone who playing a cleric in game of chosing the effect, and not making sure it was ok, lol, cracks me up how sloppy your operations are over there."<P>Kastrina - Good post.  I have no clue as to how VI runs things behinds the scenes because they don't tell anyone.  It would seem that having a high level player that plays the game (in a guild also) would be an excellent idea for hands on input of such things.  I would trust him far more than some other blue names I see "around" that don't play the game - provided he was given the freedom to be honest.  <P>The choice he made for the BP was a good one.  It was fun for me (as implemented) and fun for other Clerics and those that were helped with it (yes, it was not only the Cleric with the BP that benefitted from them, this is a heal we are talking about).  VI admitted that there are a lot of them in the game so obviously, based on their own admission, there are a lot of Clerics with them so this "nerf" does negatively affect a large number of players (not just Clerics).  <P>I wonder if people realize that the effect on the BP had its own built-in "exploit prevention".  With all Celestial spell line effects, there is a "buff" icon which lasts the duration of the healing effect.  This means that only one BP (or any of the Celestial line) heal could be cast on the target.  Additional Celestial's will NOT stack.  Additionally, a higher level Clerics' Celestial cannot be overwritten by a lower level Clerics' Celestial.  Timing consecutive Celestial's from multiple Clerics to create "an exploitive" situation would be difficult at best.  The 20 second cast time on the BP was always extremely dangerous.  It was never an "easy" heal to use, except for downtime healing, and even then, it was extremely annoying to be doing "nothing" for 20 seconds.  Using the BP incorrectly meant dead (or hurt) people in your group.  There were many times on high level raids where this BP's heals were required.  Because of "sitting" agro (which still exists btw), one could not gain mana back while attempting to sit for more healing.  <P>Additionally, if a player has 15 buffs on, this effect will not work on this player.  All Celestial line spells require a buff slot to be free.  <P>Additionally, you could not use any Celestial on someone with a "Lich" like effect on until recently when they decided to fix the stacking "bug".  This was especially painful to a Cleric grouped with a necro or player using a Bloodpoint.<P>Additionally, you could not use any Celestial on someone diseased, until recently when they decided to fix the stacking "bug".  <P>I agree 100% that there is no accountability here.  This BP was introduced in the latest expansion...many months after the Donals BP.  The supervisor(s) (and dev team) in charge here was/were obviously asleep (for many months).<P>The mobs have not changed (except for more healing taunt) and now we no longer have a functional BP effect.  You introduce a BP effect and new mobs with it.  You remove the BP effect month's later, increase heal taunt, leave the mobs "as is" and give the players nothing in return.  Balance?  Perhaps, if you consider perceived "mob intelligence improvement", increased downtime, lowered Cleric class versatility and less player fun "balanced".<P>1. Manastone nerf.<BR>2. Resurrection nerf(s).<BR>3. Wisdom soft cap nerf.<BR>4. Root nerf(s).  Yes, the Root line actually worked at one time.<BR>5. MoK nerf.<BR>6. Healing taunt nerf.<BR>7. Melee classes taunt "tuning".<BR>8. Donals BP nerf.<BR>9. SoV Cleric BP (4 of them) effect nerf(s).<P>I'm sure I missed a few "stealth nerfs" and not so "stealthy" ones as well.<P>Taking away "fun" and versatility/usefulness for a player is not a good thing.  Having this effect in the game did not negatively affect anyone in the game, in fact, it had a very positive effect on many players lives.  I know of many people I had grouped with who had fun because of it.  Success in the game is fun.  Less downtime, and less "Loading, please wait..." is a good thing.  There are too many timesinks in this game as it is.  Just logging into the game is a timesink.  Also, there will always be failure and challenge in this game, death in this game is inevitable, unavoidable and occurs with regular frequency - and since you only get one Cleric per group (if you can find a Cleric), we are not considered<BR>"unbalancing".  Clerics are NOT gods, contrary to what some boa****l Clerics will tell you and popular belief.  One healing effect will not and did not break the game.  In fact, I know some players who have said that VI broke the game...not due to a BP effect as designed, but due to incessant, uncaring, thoughtless strings of nerfs.  The fact that EQ did not crash and burn up to your recent "nerfs" is proof positive of this.  <P>The BP is available to anyone who wishes to do the quests or go to PoG post 46 (unlike your Manastone nerf where the item is removed from the drop tables and all existing instances are left AS IS thus becoming a "nyeh nyeh, I got one and you dont" item which is hardly fair or balanced).  Your idea of "balance" and challenge will not work if the player is not enjoying him/herself in your "game".  Aye, there are multitudes of lower level Clerics who don't have this BP and will never know what it's like to have one with this effect due to your nerfs, but for the large number of Clerics that do have them, you are not making the game more "fun" for them or the players they affect "in your world" by chain-nerfing them.<P>I don't have a Donal's BP, but I would do a poll to see if they want their effect changed to something useful and fun for them.  Add a small area for player feedback on the poll screen.  Assign Absor and Abashi to read these responses and take the time to read them.<P>---------========&lt; Thx info. &gt;========----------</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The link from Caster's Realm got me here. It was titled "I REALLY HATE CLERICS LIKE YOU!"<P>Now I know VI does not hate clerics, but I sure do feel like it. Every single cleric change in the last year has been negative from the clerics point of view. Now before someone points out MOK it was weakened before they gave a little back during class balance. Look at the class balance list. It's the only change. All the others are on the "wish list" or denied.<BR>I have played almost from day one. I am no means a power gamer I have one character over level 20 and it's a cleric level 51. I have not played the game in about a month, I am having a real hard time getting excited about playing him with the changes of late.

</FONT><HR>My thoughts are the same as most others but I'm going to back up my ideas with facts.<P>1. Cleric is the only preist or pure caster with no way to regen mana.<BR>Enchanter-Clarity-ToT<BR>Necro-Lich<BR>Mage-some armor spell<BR>Wizard-Harvest and I think maybe epic item<BR>Druid-mask of hunter and protection of the glade<BR>Shaman-Canabilize/Regen<BR>Cleric--NADA<P>2. Donals BP let you cast CH every 30secs or so for free vs 400mana. That is approximately 7 ticks at 55mana/tick.<P>So I suggest making a hybrid breeze/regen BP.<BR>6 mana/tick 3hp/tick. What does this mean?<P>In 7 ticks (28 seconds) instead of casting CH you cast...well nothing. Because in 7ticks you have gained 42mana and 21hp.<P>In 4.5 minutes you can cast a CH with the mana you regen'd. And you will have approx 200hp regened too if you were low. <P>This would sufficently nerf the BP in my mind. 30 seconds vs 4.5 minutes. You can't chain cast squat anymore...and if you got off an extra CH on an uber per cleric equipped with the BP then that's great but you should have been killing it a little quicker =p<P>Upsides? <P>Well I got my hp regen factor which helps balance it a little.<P>Clerics can stop talking about "we are the only class with no mana regen"<P>The mana gained can be cast anyway you choose. The old BP was making non-warriors poor choices on raids because they could not survive long enough for a BP heal. Now your using normal casting times again.<P>My favorite suggestion is for a casting time reduction BP...but that won't happen.<P>Another suggestion similar to clarity type effect would be cannabalism or dark empathy. One of the BP's is called forbidden rites. If I could give my HP to another or use it to heal them...the number of times I used that on an uber would be substantially smaller.<P>Even say a 10 second 1000hp heal cast that removed 500hp from the cleric would be decent.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
