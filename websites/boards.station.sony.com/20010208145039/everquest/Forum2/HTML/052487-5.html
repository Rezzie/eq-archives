</FONT><HR>It's true that my warrior friend is enjoying SoV more than I am, but even as a mage I'm having fun. I'm still hunting in Eastern Wastes. Oh, I did explore the other zones, but I didn't bother to stay very long.<P>Now many mobs are greening out and the giants have too much HP to bother trying (alone), so I'll just hop over to Great Divide and explore that a little more.

</FONT><HR>Velious is nice, frame rates are much more tolerable in Velious zones than they were in most Kunark zones (for me anyway).  And the zones are nice for solo necros  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  However, there are some obvious problems:<P>1).  PoG is being abused.  It's hard, but it's not THAT hard heh.<BR>2).  The loot in PoG (easy to get) is virtually the same as the rewards for doing extremely difficult quests in Thurgadin/Kael/Skyshrine.  I frankly can't believe that you guys made all the armor pieces the same (roughly) - I mean sheesh, in a world (Norrath I mean) where everyone is striving to show their distinctiveness, everyone is going to have pretty much exactly what those around them have (just different colors).<BR>3).  Siren's Grotto MUST be toned down.  It is pointless to go there - you even have to (normally) sacrifice 1 person per group to just get to Western Wastes through the Grotto.  It's absolutely nightmarish<BR>4).  Lots of seemingly broken quests.<BR>5).  And my personal favorite - quest NPC's in Skyshrine (that I try to use frequently) are camped 24/7.  It is getting out of hand.<BR>6).  It seems that if you chose the side of the dragons, you are extremely limited as to where you can hunt in Velious.<BR>7).  I haven't hunted there yet personally, but Velketor's Labyrinth (or whatever it's called) seems to regularly slaughter large groups of people - costing necro's a great deal of time and money ;(<BR>8).  Corroded/Torn Enchanted/Enchanted/Whatever pieces need to drop more frequently from slightly lower mobs.  <P>ok things I like:<P>1).  Unlike Kunark, you can travel through the CENTER of zones in Velious.  Of course you have to be invisible, but in Kunark invis didn't work on ANYTHING so nobody has ever seen the center of some of the most beautiful zones created in Kunark.  Because we all cling to the edges of the zones when we travel through.<BR>2).  As a necro, I like knowing exactly where I stand as far as faction goes  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  There are no surprise faction-based lashings in Velious for me =)  *cheer<BR>3).  For midlevels, it seems to be a really nice place to hunt with moderately impressive loot.  For high levels, it's nice for solo'ing or small groups.  But for dungeon crawling, you have to have 60 people with you to make it inside any of the higher dungeons - I mean, the mobs in Icewell?  Holy cow.  It takes 2 groups of 55+'s five minutes to beat one down.  It's insane.<BR>4).  There are a number of really easy things to kill that drop some spiffy items (I won't name these for fear of being stalked by people if you nerf it!)<BR>5).  The over all "feel" of Velious is very nice.  Well done with that guys.<P><BR>That's all I can think of =)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I must admit, Velious is fun!<P>So far, the zones I've explored and Mobs I've looked at have been interesting and entertaining, and drop some very nice loot.<P>The only problem I've spotted so far though is for us really big people...Ogres - and where to get supplies:<P>When you land at the docks, the Gnome igloos are obviously too small to allow for any trading. As you go further inland, you can go to the Giant city (I'm building my faction for here), but when you start your faction will not allow any trading. If you then try the Dwarf city, you're too big to fit inside ANY of the buildings, so that's a no-go for supplies as well.<P>It would have been nice to allow some access for the larger races (without having to rely on either other players, or spending some time building Giant faction).<P>I made the mistake of going there with limited food & drink supplies. Almost dropped dead from lack of food and drink before I got back  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The key classes prefer easy loot from PoG with 2 groups over going to Kael Drakkal with 3 groups (CRs ae NASTY in that zone). So the classes which cant hunt at PoG for RPG reasons or lacking loot are left behind :/<P><BR>Best way would be to close the zone until it is repopulated with harder mobs<P>Besides that Velious is lacking a dungeon like Sebilis or lguk where single level 50+ people can gather to start a group.

</FONT><HR>I have to agree with most of the posters here.<BR>-Iceclad: Nice zone which consists 75% out of nothing but open water. This makes waiting for the boat a pain. Getting attacked by dervs at the dragon portal is very annoying but ok, I could live with that. Not really much to say about this zone.<BR>-EWastes: Another huge zone without too much content.<BR>-Greater Divide: Pretty nice zone with mobs for almost all level ranges. I like the hidden Thurgadin entrance. Tizmak caves are nicely designed and challenging for players of the appropriate level.<BR>-Thurgadin: Nice city with lots of merchants and loads of quests. The dorfs' mumbling was unique at first, but gets rather annoying by now...if they would only say something else than "Waagtresgbndsnd".<BR>-Icewell Keep (ThurgadinB): One word - ridiculous. Mobs that con blue and are unmezzable, unstunnable, they summon, are immune to almost all spells (heat and *SOME* poison based spells occasionally work). Loot is OK (velium armor, spells). But who ever had the idea of a lvl 45 mob triple-hitting for 177s needs to overthink that idea. Contrary to what everyone else says: You do *NOT* get Tormax faction for killing guards in the first and second floor of Icewell Keep (even though I wish I would get it). Risk vs. Reward isn't really good but acceptable.<BR>Kael Drakkal: This town needs a serious revamp. There are hardly any merchants. Quest NPCs wander off in the middle of a conversation. Quests to improve Tormax faction need to be done about 800 times to get to indiff. Other quests render useless rewards (e.g. bracelet of sacrifice). But the main problem is merchants. There is no logical or gameplay reason as to why giants wouldn't have the same merchants as dorfs.<BR>-Wakening Lands: Actually it's a nice zone for lvl 40+. But PLEASE: Remove Wuoshi from the teleport circle. His aggro range is insane and he warps over huge distances to root and kill you. Then he camps your corpse. So CR consists of finding a necro (or SK now), a coffin....the usual thing.<BR>-Skyshrine: I haven't spent much time there because of the same thing that goes for all Velious mobs: They con green and kill you in a few seconds.<BR>-Cobalt Scar: Nice zone with little use. A few sirens, wyverns and cobalt drakes. Nothing really exciting here - mainly a pass-through zone to WWastes. The Othmir give nice quests though.<BR>-Siren's Grotto: Total waste - enough said.<BR>-Plane of Growth: I like the idea of the Protectors of the Growth regularly spawning, but the drop rate is hilarious.<BR>I haven't been to the other zones but one thing they all seem to have in common:<BR>The mobs are WAY too hard. It should not be the case that a blue mob needs 2 groups to kill. Resistances are WAY too high. Did you never think of the poor bards who get every song resisted (well, all classes do)?<BR>Another VERY sad point is: A PC never resists NPC spells (lvl 54 bard on 2nd level of Tower of Frozen Shadows with both poison and magic resist over 150 did not resist a SINGLE Shock of Poison). Basically this counts for some Kunark zones as well (lvl 54 bard with close to 200MR gets nuked by a burynai cenobite).<BR>To do something in Velious, you need raid-sized groups in order to fight 2 or 3 blue mobs. I can't say anything good about exp because you lose more exp dying (even with res) than you make.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Crystal Cavern:<P>I love this zone, zone level range is 30 - 40 with not giving XP after 40.  This is a great range, very appropriate, no super MOB's  (that I've seen) with a good distribution.  <P>MOB's are spread out, the rares Herbalist, Inspector, Foreman are all seem regularly, they just don't drop good stuff all the time.  BTW GREAT common drop on Herbalist (weight reducing pack) and making it lore was also a great idea.  I haven't gotten a spot in a Queen Group yet (LVL 45 + groups always camping for some reason) but I did get into a Teror group and again GREAT SK only spear, first really good weapon I've looted.<P>Loot is good for level and once prices stablize this stuff will not be farmed so much but will still help the 30 - 40 level people who get it.<P>I have fought this zone with a full group and did a "Raid".  We fought down from the door to the Terrors with my Guild (Panderers of Chaos) the first time we entered the zone.  Great fun, a good mix of terror and excitement.  I also have fought with a partner (SK/Druid) and in small groups, this zone supports all of these methods.<P>All in all, I think you guys got this zone right.<P>Thanks<P>Neptunis Rex<BR>LVL 39 DE SK<P>p.s.  now give us a hint on the Dwarf Faction there, PLEASE</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Playing a rogue there's nothing I can do on my own anywhere in the world anyway, so when I'm in Velious it's on guild/group raids. My favorite zones are Velketors labyrinth and Skyshrine. <P>Thurgadin is the best made city in the game, not only because you can do most tradeskills there, but because of the way you've scripted the NPC's. That's good work. Still wondering why so many NPC's need to sell exactly the same thing though...<P>Icewell is ok to hunt for xp, but nothing besides spells and gems drops there, and randomly the Ice shard dagger. And loot on Grizznot needs to be improved.<P>Eastern wastes seem to be a popoular hunting ground. The orc fort is the best looking area in the game, I'm happy you put in orcs again. I'm really too high to hunt for xp there, so I can't tell when it comes to loot and such.<P>Iceclad Ocean is OK. The tower of frozen shadows looks threatening, the pirates are scripted well, and I happened to view the gnolls reactions once when Lodizal got close to shore: Best story I've seen told in the game so far. The dervishes are too aggressive and plentiful though, and when they drop no loot it's even more bitter to get killed by a gang of those. You really should put a bind point in this zone for melees. I suggest the sand island you first come to by boat, or perhaps at zone in Crystal Caverns.<P>Tower of frozen shadows: Keys, traps - closest I've come to a real dungeon crawl in EQ. You should do the same with keys here that you did to soulbound dragon ring teeth though - If you have a higher level one you don't need the ones under.<P>Crystal caverns - no flaws. Dwarven NPC's could have been more communicative though... guess working on my faction fixes that.<P>Velketors labyrint - the reason I like it is because of the sliding floors. It really needs everyone to be fully concentrated, none of that AFK every 2 minutes... I haven't gotten further than the top icepaw village, but so far the dimensions of the zone and the risk fits me well, lot has been sparse though...<P>Skyshrine - is huge. It's fun to work your way in here, it's a nice thing with the labyrinth and teleports, pathing works... but mob drops as good as nothing. After killing a level 63 wurm and getting 6 gold it doesn't feel right. Earlier you'd feel you'd get rewarded overall because the golems and gargoyles early at zone dropped sentry and guardian armor. Now they drop almost nothing it seems. I suggest put the sentry and guardian armor on the wurms and higher level mobs furter up...<P>Rest of the zones I haven't spent enough time in to comment upon. Cobalt Scar isn't really much to say about. It really has an unique feel and look, no idea how it is to hunt there. My guild is planning someday to dare rushing through Sirens grotto. It does sound like a wasted zone, judging from comments...<P><BR>Overall I like Velious a lot better than Kunark. It's a more likeable size and you get a better feeling of the creatures inhabiting it and their internal conflicts. Quests are better, NPC-scripting is a LOT better, look is mostly better and bind points more accessible it seems. Best looking mob: Velium crawler. Worst look: Sentinent armor (helms look real bad). High level mobs have too high MR though, and Wuoshi shouldn't, if he's supposed to have that huge aggro range, camp corpses for 30 mins after killing a player.<P>My biggest complaint has nothing to do with loot, mobs, zones or look, but with trade skills: Why in heavens name couldn't you put in ALL the stuff needed, and make it so that recipies actually work? I understand you test it on the test server first, but shouldn't you have learned by now that this is no guarantee that it works on live? You need more people on trade skills, or better cooperation between the one(s) you have and the programmers, eventually forget spells and class balance for a few weeks and concnetrate on doing a REAL overall on tradeskills, not this little by little by little by little...<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hmm .... when I read the comments about the PoG, I have to wonder if it is truly that easy or just elite uber guilders jeluous that commoners have a hope of getting good gear ... so then I read the follow post made by someone. It answered my question  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>&gt;&gt;"PoG is totaly messed up: with NO RISK AT ALL you get the BEST armor of the game.<P>After doing a hard hard work to make our guild able to kill Trakanon we now have to see people running around with better-than-Trakanon-armor who never killed anything bigger than frog chef in sebilis before."&lt;&lt;<P>So no armor should be had by casual gamers unless we bring our own trak-killing size uber-guild group. Is that is what is being said by the PoG complainers???<P>To me, PoG is the perfect "safety-valve" for the majority of players (you know, us causal players that make the most money for Verant  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">). We are now reaching the 50+ ranges but have little hope of getting Fear/Hate/Dragon loot since they're booked up by those special few as the one poster mentioned.<P>To me PoG is just right for the majority of players. It is nice to see Verant *finally* not boosting the difficulty of everything to give the uberguilds a challenge. Don't get me wrong, Verant has gone overboard on many parts of Velious as mentioned by others. But at least there are some places for those of us that don't belong to trak killing guild.<P>Chyrlene<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I didnt really want to comment on this thread but... well what the hey  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Iceclad ocean:<BR>Good hunting (especially solo) at 35+. Lots of quests, lots of mobs, lots of story line... Rare mob with 'uber' loot, rare spawns, good items... Just amazing.  If this was what the rest of velious was like, only higher level, the expansion would have been amazing.<P>Tower of Frozen Shadow:<BR>Exactly what I wanted from everquest. A dungeon crawl.  Really should be a 'master key' once you've made it to the top, however.  Couple of the items here are definately worth having, at the targeted level range.  The only problem is that for the targeted level range, the same problems that plague the hole and mistmoore exist here in some parts as well.<P>Eastern Wastes:<BR>Good places to hunt here as well 35+.  Decent items from most of them. Quests, fun, etc.  Enjoyable. Like it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>The Great Divide:<BR>the quests that take place here are great.  Good hunting, spell drops, etc.  Well done as well.<P>Thurgardin:<BR>Very 'alive' city.  I dont know anything about fighting here, but as a city its pretty amazing. Lots of good quests, several high level ones in particular.  Well designed city zone.<P>Icewell keep:<BR>As for the dwarf section, I dont know much.  As for a dungeon, I only know that the mobs here are incredibly difficult.  I dont even believe this is itemized? We found very little, other than a few spells and gems. Not that those are bad things, but rare items are always a nice touch. Underutilized on our server.<P>Vektelor's Lab;<BR>I know little about this zone, so will refrain from comment.<P>Kael:<BR>Amazing zone, for quests as well as hunting. As alive as thurgardin, great quests, etc.  Plus hunting here is really a rush.  We've tried the arena, king tormax's area, the vindicator, etc.  The items are amazing, certainly worthy of killing the 60+ mobs required to get them. However the boss mobs in this zone are a bit on the too damn hard side. Please consider balancing them.  King tormax, and the vidicator, both only dropped ever on any server so far.  I dont think that's what you were going for, was it?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Wakening Lands:<BR>Very well designed. Lots of choices and differnt things to hunt. Many are blue to 60.  good drops here worth spending your time for.  Several factions are represented here and its great.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Plane of Growth:<BR>Very well designed, fun to fight in.  The faction hits are amazingly staggering, but in exchange the items are staggering as well.  The perfect example of risk vs reward in velious.<BR>Skyshrine:<BR>Is this zone done yet?  Many of the quests dont work, (such as they sentry that asks for a pie, the cook/baker's requests give you nothing) and there appears to be no high end quests like as in kael or thurgardin.  Even with superb yelinek faction, people havent found them.  Either they are too hard to find, or simply not implemented.  many of the quests are broken in this zone, fix them.<P>While I know very little about hunting here, it appears hunting here does indeed gain you some worthy higher end items.<P>Cobalt Scar:<BR>Very amusing zone.  The otters are great.  The Cobalt drakes who 'AoE" the entire friggin world, are not.  The sirens are too difficult for even the most insane 60 level group to attempt.  Basically, this is just a zone you travel through to get to somewhere else.<BR>------------------------------------------<BR>Please note, that any zone past here NEEDS to have incredible awards due to the difficulties involved in traveling to them.  Risk vs reward should lean towards reward due to the simple fact that anything past this point needs multiple groups, and getting multiple groups there is a nightmare<BR>-------------------------------------------<P><BR>Sirens Grotto:<BR>What in the @#$@#$ were you thinking?  This zone is the most dangerous, poorly designed, horribly itemized, impossible to use zone on the planet.  Its only purpose is to be in the way of western wastes and other such zones. making 'see invis' mobs here is a mistake as now it takes an evacer with 'succor' to get through the zone at all. items, for those insane enough to even try this place, have been dismal. corpse recovery here makes plane of fear break in look easy. Please figure out a way to use this zone, as it is now, its a deplorable waste of resources.<P>Western Wastes:<BR>good place for a raid type event.  Good items drop from feirce and entertaining encounters.  The only problem is you have to go through sirens grotto to get here.  Because of that, expect it to be underutilized.<P>Dragon Necropolis:<BR>Very well designed zone.  Very amusing zone to fight in as well.  Most of it requires multiple groups, obviously as intended, but the rewards are worth the time spent.  The faction balance and choice of sides inside is pretty interesting.  Unique npcs that are fun to fight exist here, and we love it.<BR>The decision to make items here much more rare, I feel, was a mistake as simply getting people here (because of sirens grotto and western wastes) is absurdly difficult.<BR>We have found the items now too rare to warrent the travel time and risk of fighting in this zone, as will most of your customers once they try it for themselves.<P>Temple of Veeshan:<BR>Not a lot of first hand experience here, but I'll say something.  IF its as bad as it players have remarked it is, I dont think we'll ever go there.  Even though my guild seems to be siding with dragons, the hall of testing certainly seems to have no concept of risk vs reward.  I'm utterly stunned that the quest rewards for doing _THIS_ is the same rewards from hunting the arena in kael, with a few exceptions.  Making PoM harder to get to was also about the worst idea on the planet, as people might actually want to fight in PoM but not enough to try and navigate this zone.<P>Plane of Mischeif:<BR>Unimplimented.  its in game, sure, but its not itemized or completed.  We'll see when its done  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Uselessness - Mobs have insane HP, MR, Regen, ect... Thus as a druid the one USEFUL thing I can provide to a group (SNARE) is taken away, what are we now about as good as a paladin wearing leather at 40+. I know other classes are hurt alot by the MR as well, Shaman and Enchanters although they can buff. Hows about making an indoor version of snare that checks like a lure (resistable on MR mobs, almost unresistable on non-MR mobs)<P>Spells - I havent seen any spells dropped yet well one Magician DOT spell. Fix the drop rates and take a look at the server populations. I would hazard a guess that druid/necro spells should drop a bit more than say Magician spells.<P>Iceclad - Remove those damn dervishs from wandering near the portal god damn. Its so easy to die just porting in.<P>Eastern Wastes - Nice zone, lots of animal mobs for us druids to get xp with or play. I still wonder if those snow griffins are connected to any sort of quest.<P>Kael Drakkel - Gods I thought this was so cool till I wandered arround and suddenly got smacked for 500 damage. Whoever made this zone is a sadist only deity level encounters should hit that hard.<P>Great Divide - Never really explored it, great place to hunt dorfs tho.<P>Thurgadin - Same as above, poses a problem for large races (Troll, Ogre, Barbarian) wanting to move arround in there if they arent shaman.<P>Icewell Keep - Nice zone, please fix the pathing, we were pulling over the ice pit when something went the wrong way and POOF all of a sudden there was like 20 mobs hitting us all for 120... We havent gone down the bottom part yet tho but I hear it drops some nice stuff.<P>I was seriously disapointed by the lack of big 2hb weapons that are readily aquired in the 40-50 range. I have to wait till I get 55+ before I even can think of getting a decent 2hb. I'm a druid and if I cant snare, heal, nuke or DOT then all I got is melee and obviously almost all other classes outshine us there.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Level 60 monk, I've been to most of the zones in Velious (except Veeshan's temple and PoM) <BR>I do not claim to be an expert in all the Velious zones, however these are my observations:<P>Skyshrine, Great looking zone, awsome. However, very linear. Wouldn't be bad to perhaps make more then just one secret wall in this place, or expand it somehow (perhaps a portal to Veeshan's peek as long as you are amiable to Yelinak and Claws of Veeshan) <BR>Also, Please put more quests into Skyshrine. Currently, the only reason to ally yourself with dragons is if your guild plans on doing the same. There are very few quests here. <BR>By the way, I will be ranting about Skyshrine and Kael Drakkel the most in this post. I have the most knowledge of these.<BR>Next, Lord Yelinak faction. I spent literally a month of busting my rear, killing giants for Toes and Helms and doing those low level quests to just get to dubious with him. Perhaps, Either increase the drop rate of Giant toes and Helms, or Increase the faction bonus you get from the quests or even put in some new quests that add more faction.. <BR>Main turnoff with skyshrine is BROKEN or unimplimented quests, and NPCs who don't even speak to you past the maze. Why would anyone want to be amiable with dragons when there is hardly anything to offer?<BR>One more thing about Skyshrine. The way quests are implimented, is you have to wait for the NPC with the right quest to even start the quest. Why??<BR>Why not just move the stacked quests to other npc's that say absolutely Nothing?<BR>With the respawn time in this zone, it's damn hard getting the right quest. Also, if you play at odd times such as me, you are unable to get the right quest npc at all. So, this is basically hurting Euros. Please fix that.<BR>One more thing before I leave Skyshrine topic.. You have 4 bartenders in this zone. At the LEAST, make One of them sell some Booze!<P>Sorry for the drawn out post, but I feel strongly about this topic. I have changed my allegiance to giants from dragons just so I can do quests that don't require me to kill red to 60 mobs (Level 60 is boring if you are not raiding 24/7) So basically, due to the aspect of my above statement, I have wasted a very Large amount of my time working on faction in Hopes to do some cool quests and read about the history of the dragons, now I have to spend even more to be able to do the same with giants.<P>Ok, now getting onto Kael. Increase the Reward here Please. It is pretty damn hard to kill the Vindicator and Tormax (as I hear) let alone the statue of Rallos Zek, and the loot to do these achievments.. heh, just isn't worth it. Also increase the reward for the other high level mobs. I mean, they hit for 250 a pop, have thousands upon thousands of HP and ermm.. You get lucky if a toe or helmet drops. <BR>Suggestions, first, Fix the Giant Scale Mail. It's pathetic when compared to the armor that drops in Thurgadin B, and Skyshrine. There is very Little point to ally yourself with dwarves or dragons, when giants drop such crappy loot. Also, add some quests for those giant heads other then PoG, If I take people down there and kill all those tough bastards, I want to have a use for those heads, only rangers (I think currently) benefit, and that's rangers who have decided to not soil thier PoG faction. So.. You created super tough mobs just for umm one class.. hrmm.<P>Now, let's move to Siren's Grotto. <BR>Hehe..  fix this zone if you want anyone to actually go into this place other then raiding for the first time or passing through to Western Wastelands.<P>Now, let's talk about Western Wastes.<BR>Cool zone, however, even if you are warmly to dragons, the green crap here still attacks you.<BR>Any idea how difficult it is to find out about quests in this zone with aggro blues running around you?<BR>Isn't that sorta pointless?<BR>Again, why sign up with the dragons?<P>One more thing before I end this book.<BR>Please make it so that when any Summoning Mob GATES, that they are mem wiped.<BR>Or at least, put in some means on Some class to actually interrupt giant classed mobs other then alot of wizards. It kills the fun when that mob gates and your raid starts getting summoned one by one.<BR>ALSO, when the mob gates, AT LEAST, make it so they don't heal back 1/4 of thier life.<P>Tired of raids being ruined by one mob that is a coward and all of a sudden get's healed and destroys your raid.<P>Well, I hope yall read this, because as it stands now, if you are smart you will stick with Giant Faction. That increases your killing options, and also increases the loot you are able to get. Oh, also you are able to kill in PoG.<BR>Right now, the factions are a joke to the high level people. Check your monitors and see how many people are actually in Kael Drakkel..<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Whats fun about farming a zone like that?  Whats challenging about doing that?<P>Take 2-3 groups to the waterfall then fight your way down river to the lake.  You will have some fun doing that.  You wont think PoG is too easy at that point.

</FONT><HR><BR>As a hybrid who signed in with the Claw of Veeshan's faction I can only express I'm dissapointed with Velious so far.<P>It looks like only the Giants faction give proper content to keep you somewhat entertained, even tho the armor quests prove to be way out of line Risk vs Reward-wise.<P>Anyway, Tormax is almost unkillable while guilds have taken down Yelinak many times already. It's almost impossible to raise Yelinak faction, as only a few quests involving rare items and the toughest mobs in Tormax's castle give positive hits. The giants at the entrance of his castle could give Yelinak hits at least, or at the very least those 63+ sentinels !<P>Most of the zones have an awful RvR factor, Siren's grotto and Veeshan's Temple being in the top worst ever been put live in the history of EQ.<P>Skyshrine is so botched it isn't funny, with very few quests, most broken, very few vendors, many broken and obviously put in as an afterthought. The armor quests, Uh well, refer to Temple of Veeshan, the testing grounds entrance itself is a nightmare, I have yet to see ONE high lvl CoV or Yelinak quest completed.<BR>Also, thanks for nothing about Sleeper's Tomb. Apparently mobs are KoS there if you have good CoV/Yelinak faction, and give CoV faction hits if you kill them ! Add one more zone where I won't be able to hunt at all.<P>To top it off as a lvl 60 SK I really wonder why I'm tagging along with my guilds on raids, most mobs are 100% RM so my spells can't land (gotta love blue con dwarf guards that are totally immune to lifetaps, or the mobs in Siren's grotto that are RM immune or CAN'T be Darknessed), and they generally hit so hard I can't agro and tank them or I go down within a few rounds of melee. Not to mention the hours of downtimes involved in getting enough people to start said raids, CRs, set against too few fights where anyway I'll get probably splattered if I ever dare Taunt or land a spell.<P>Actually, the ONLY zone where I can play a role and have some fun is Plane of Growth. And I understand why it is farmed so much by big guilds, it's simply the ONLY zone (esp. if you made the mistake to choose CoV faction) in the whole continent that offers a good RvR factor at the highest levels.<P>The rest is totally out of line, and 2 months after its release I end up avoiding Velious like a plague. Actually, I found a renewed interest in BG 2 lately, when my guild isn't doing raids, it reminds me that games can be fun too.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I enjoy hunting with a single group a lot. It's my favorite thing to do in EQ. I was very disappointed with how that turned out in Velious.<P>Siren's Grotto: Totally unviable for a single group - at least for any that I could make. NPCs at zone hit for much harder than their level suggests (been a while since I bothered going there, but I think it was something along the lines of 2 or 3 -times- harder than similar level mobs in kunark), were immune to magic, and/or giant flagged. Interestingly, one caster type walrus had very weak magic resistance, while the others were totally immune. My suggestion - lower the resistances of everything in here. Make them have similar health and do similar damage to things in kunark. Remove any unmezzable flags. Make it a viable hunt zone. At the very least, make it so a single group can get through this dungeon without having to use abscond - remove the ability of anything to see invis, for example. Dragon Necropolis seems like it could be used for single group xp, but I can't even reach it without a raid. <P>Velketor's Labyrinth - I've tried hunting kobolds in here. I wish I could love this place. But it's pretty hard to convince people to fight level 51 npcs that hit for 200 as an xp source (Icepaw Kobold Champion). If you need basis for comparison, level 57 Sebilite Juggernauts in old Sebilis hit substantially lighter (170s or so). I like how the dungeon looks, and how it's laid out - but the npcs hit far harder than they should. You could probably halve their damage and come out about right. Others have identified subpar loot as well - I wouldn't know, nothing dropped while I was here. The green gargoyles at entrance had pretty high resistances to me too - probably would make things unviable for lower level parties, but I don't know anyone who has tried.<P>Kael Drakkal - I've only hunted in here a few times, just to check the ZEM really. I've gotten some decent items while here, although maybe I've just gotten lucky. However, the really poor xp has prevented me from doing this place. Everything being unmezzable and unstunnable turns my kill rate into a fraction of what it could be in other dungeons - I don't really know of any easy solutions for making it better beyond adjusting the ZEM to be much higher, lowering the hps of giants to make them die faster (and probably lowering their damage - greens were hitting much harder than they should have been), making the casters not gate (they can't be stunned), reducing their attack speed (would make crowd control easier... not sure if you can adjust this, though), or reducing their aggro radius to make single pulls easier. In any case, it's not a very fun zone for me as an enchanter - giant flags cause me to forget about half my normally memorized spells, and replace them with substandard trash.<P>Icewell Keep - Can't comment on the dwarves, trying to stay on good terms with them. I hunted the Pit area though. Awful. Resists aren't necessarily crazy on them, but frostspikes are giant flagged. Giant flagged icy terrors? Silliness, especially when you can get 3 in one pull in a small area. Npcs, you guessed it, hit much harder than they should. They seem to have too much health, too, but that might just be my perception. Grizznot drops a cloak that's worse than cloak of the ice bear. We kept looking for 'haste' to be written on it.<P>Plane of Growth - this zone is tedious. Too much stuff is marked as unmezzable. I would actually prefer it if the zone was much harder while I could mez larger pulls... as is, things seem pretty easy to get single, and I wind up bored out of my skull while buffing people. I was hoping for a higher level Fear-type break of a good plane, and I end up doing something less engaging than powerleveling newbies. How about much greater mob density with just about all of them being mezzable?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Siren's Grotto is about the most rediculous zone around at the moment.  I haven't seen one post that commends this zone and I would like to see it changed.  It has some downright horrible pathing to begin with.  When you are dealing with a zone full of 50+ mobs, details like this matter. <BR>Cobalt Scar is another zone I really have a problem with.  There is nothing technically wrong (that I have seen) with this zone.  But it just seems to be a large waste of space.  I zoned in towards the beginning of SoV release.  I was quite disappointed.   Other than the few quest Otterman and the uber-rare sea monster, this zone has nothing of interest to just about anyone.  I would like to see some more quest mobs, etc.<P>-Fryedegg Overeasy &lt;Prophecy&gt;<BR>-Bertoxxulous<P>P.S.

</FONT><HR>Few areas in Norrath match the beauty of Velious via Ultravision.  I first arrived by night, alone, and made the trek through Iceclad in awe of just how good the trees looked.  Hadn't seen anything that beautiful since right before I axed Quillmane a few months ago.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Velketor's, CC, Thurgadin, Kael, all look great.  Tower of Frozen Shadow is awe-inspiring.  I just wish I could climb to its top, tho' I've gotten close.  It LOOKS great.<P>The con system seems designed to limit xp gain.  Green mobs in Velious would be blue or even anywhere else given the way they hit.  But they con green, thus little xp can be gained.  This I do not like.<P>Plane of Growth seems to be too good to be true.  Average risk for well above average reward.  I think the good stuff found there should be diluted a bit, with loot spread more over the rest of Velious.  <P>I'm not looking forward to dealing with the MR of the high level mobs (shaman here).  It seems like buffing and poison is all I'll be able to do, assuming I don't just head back to Kunark.<P>Velious is geared to having you go with dwarf/CoV faction.  And then screwing CoV at very high levels (when Velious becomes mainly a game of raids).<P>I've never heard of anyone hunting regularly in Siren's Grotto.  Given what is and is not in there (risk/reward), I'm not surprised.  This zone needs restructuring.<P>Thank you for putting alchemy vendors in Thurgadin.  Finding them absolutely made my day.  Now make Alchemy useful for more than three potions.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Final Words:  For my 40s, Velious is great.  For my guildmates in their low 50s, Velious is great.  Unless the guild doubles in size with 50+ people, Velious will be left behind in favor of Sebilis, Chardok, etc.  It really does seem unfinished to me (PoM being a major point there).  But then, in some ways that describes EQ in general.  <P>Overall, though, I'm pretty happy with what I've found in this expansion.<P>-TTm</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Mobs have insane resists, insane HP for thier con(Entry guards in skyshrine)And craptacular loot. Yes, there is occasionally the stray nugget of gold, like the Sentinal robe I have, or a few other things here and there, but over all, this stuff hoses. Spell drops? Where? 2 Wurms in GD, the deathcave of the Holgresh, thats all you have for the &lt;50 spells. Plus now I am 45, I am starting to look for my 50+ spell drops, do they drop here? nope.

Let any mob of the appropriate level drop a spell from both expansions. <P>Zone Design<BR>Iceclad, Dervishes Suck. I say again, Dervishes Suck. <P>Tower, this potentially could be the coolest zone(s) in the game. It possibly could go on forever. Just add more floors in a patch and there is more fun.

An Ok zone Dervishes suck once again.<P>Crystal Caverns, outstanding zone, once again, overcons.<P>Velketors, Transparent Death. Unless you have a multiple group raiding party, dont expect to get past the entrance. These mobs have nuts MR and drop nothing. No coins, NOTHING.<P>Thats about all for the zones<P>Suggestions<BR>REWORK CON, how? Base it off a "difficulty rating" that takes into account HP, AC, Resistance, Spell ability, Special abilities. That will give you a true con, a level 1 with 32kHP and magic immune is not even to a level 1, or deep green to a level 45.<P>Lower MR or lower the Melee damage, High MR with High melee damage = no one wants to fight it.<P><BR>Bantil/Kihaji</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My biggest complaint about Velious is the spells, or more exactly the lack of them.<P>In particular, Celestial Healing.  The only place in Velious I'm aware of this spell dropping is from Guardian Shardwurms in the Great Divide, and even then it's incredibly rare. As a level 55 cleric, I'm not too keen on the idea of camping green-con spawns for days on end hoping for a drop - especially not when other can actually get some XP for them.<P>I've also never seen this spell for auction, and I shudder to think what it would cost if someone were to sell it.  It's one of the best cleric spells around, and it seems only intended for those lucky clerics who got the Velious expansion before the spell drops were nerfed.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I'm a L52 pally, and I can take one down pretty fast, but I don't like zoning out of the tower of frozen shadow only to face 2, 3, 4, and sometimes a Lay hands wasting mob of 5 snow dervishes. I've taken to saying "Ah hell with it", rooting all the offenders, running away, and logging off to clear the agro. It is a wonderful technique I shouldn't have to use in a sea of green monsters. I call it Paladin Gate.<BR>&lt;End Snip&gt;<BR>This is one of the two reasons I despise the velious expansion.  As a Warrior (48th lev) these snow dervishes have killed me or forced me to get an escort every single time I travel through this zone.  A 53 Vicar and I cannot kill them as fast as they dogpile us, we were forced to AoE fear them, drink SoW potions, and run for our lives.  That is just plain wrong.  I really don't like spending 10pp every time I want to cross a zone, Verant.  Ok, so that's Iceclad, now for a general comment which applies to most zones:  The factions in Velious are a royal pain in the ass, and keep my normal play group from ever playing together in Velious, as we all started out KoS to different things, and if we kill anything that attacks us, half the group loses faction that they consider important to them.  This eliminates any fun that I could have in these zones.  The vying factions were a neat idea, but don't work in the practical sense.  This continuation of the attitude started in Kunark with the VS faction zones, Karnor's specifically is not appreciated.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Keys<P>I have to agree that the need for keys is overwhelming. Even dropping all your old world keys you are still stuck with several keys in even the simplest dungeons (tower).<P>Dervs<P>I have no problem with some amount of risk at the teleport rings.  Don't go crazy and make it worse when adding a quest.<P>Typical encounter<P>Most interesting, exp producing, loot producing camps are all group encounters.  A good example is the ry`gorr camp.  The chief was very well created with the chief and elites above the entrance making it hard to single pull a fully popped room. (Great design.)  The blacksmith is a more typical camp from the old world.  Both are group camps with lists. (ah well)<P>Kael<P>What?  You needed a Kithicor in Velious?  What is this need you see for firebreaks?  I'm not sure I agree that the only path to the rest of Velious should be through a kithicor-like gauntlet.  (Yes, this only applies to certain factions. However, what good hunting ground does Thurgardin lead to for those with dwarf faction?  None.)<P>Fun<P>While the game is as fun as usual and Velious is more fun since it doesn't have a lot of Kunark-like problems, what did you do to add fun?<P>An NPC that performs some light show when given a quest item? No.  Just phat lewt.  Perhaps grieving servants or compatriots appearing at the death of something you killed? No. Just exp.<P>Two places you kinda made cool.  The Avengers appearing at the death of the chief was a good touch.  (Not exactly grieveing compatriots though.)  The ry`gorr invasion is kinda cool too.  (Just wished you hadn't nerfed it.  I haven't managed to beat them yet and now I hear that even if I do I won't get the reward. Still trying anyway.)<P>TOWER<P>The Tower of Frozen Shadow (I think it's called) has some problems.  Could you please increase the horizontal distance between floors?  (I know this sounds odd.)  Apparantly you fixed the Z-axis problem by putting each floor next to each other and used mirrors and locked entry points.<P>However, if someone fights near the entrance or exit the mob will often drift into the next floor and cause an irritation to the next floor group.  On third you end up with second floor mobs appearing while you fight and screwing up targetting.  We won't even mention what it does to tracking.  Please consider moving the floors farther apart horizontally.<P>Next problem: Mirrors sending you outside without meaning to.  If you end up trying to click someone or something near the entrance you end up outside and often exposed to the dervs.  The dervs don't do much harm before you get back inside but you've just been taken out of your group for an unknown amount of time (and maybe crashed again while zoning).  I think the clickable area may be too large.<P>Beyond that, cool dungeon.<P>Crystal Caverns<P>Cool place.  Don't nerf it.  (Already been nerfed in last patch.)  The dungeon itself is well thought out.  Very cool layout, very cool that many rare spawns can spawn anywhere just about.  Allows many more to camp the dungeon since you are camping an area, not a spawn.<P>Textures<P>How about some more graphics for the items? Still no helm graphic for many drops.  Ry`gorr helm (most races) and gnome skin cap come to mind.<P>Snow Bunnies<P>Is there more to this?<P>Spell drops<P>Why do all the spells seem to drop off wurms?  If you want to keep dragon faction you never get spells?  Please rethink this.  You have asked us to choose faction now you are saying that all casters must abandon dragon faction? (Gotta say thank you for port spells though.)<P>That's enough for now. I'll rant more later.<P>texture<BR>DE druid deep in snow<P>.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Iceclad - way too much empty space, the mob population around the ring, tower and gnoll village is fairly insane - stick a couple of icebergs with something like the golras on it from TD, and you'll have a much better zone<P>Eastern Wastes - this is a good outdoor zone.<P>Great Divide - don't get me started on the spell drops.  That was an uber mistake to have the spells drop off of a 2 spawn of a particular mob from the start.  They have since been spread out a bit.  Personally I hate the idea of drop spells. If you want the spell, you are forced to hunt a particular mob in a particular zone, or pay some exhorbiant amount of money to another player.  I would much rather quest for the spell.<P>Crystal Caverns - A+  very cool.  But you need to be able to bind in the dwarven town.<P>Tower of Frozen Shadows - extremely cool design, and a lot of fun if the first 3-4 floors are full of green cons.  If not, well, its a challenge, but the loot still isn't worth it.  And please, how about a box that you can put a couple of keys in, hit combine, and get a skeleton key that works for both of the appropriate locks.  Once again, the drop rate of some very good items was reduced, so now you have groups of high level people camping green con floors for a particular item, so "climbing" the tower isn't an option anymore.<BR>Kael Drakkel - risk/reward is ridiculous.  Why on earth would you hunt the giants for the quest armor drops when you can go to Plane of Growth with 2 groups and outfit everyone in the same armor?  Either the quest needs to be a lot easier, or PoG needs to be a lot harder.<P>Thurgadin - what is up with the magic resistances?<P>Wakening Lands - except for Wuoshi, very very cool zone.  Wuoshi needs to be moved, and his aggro range reduced.<P>Skyshrine - risk/reward was totally blown when the drop rates were nerfed.  Now there is little reason to hunt here.<P>Overall every Velious monster undercons.  Pick a dungeon, and the magic resist rates make most casters largely useless except for buffs and damage shields.<BR>Siren's Grotto is the DMZ of Velious.  If you aren't an uber guild or in a very large alliance, don't even bother zoning in.<P>Here is my thing...Velious is visually appealing, has some wonderful zones with a lot of potential.  But many of the monsters are green to me, yet still pose a very serious threat to my health.  I haven't ventured any further west than skyshrine, largely because most of my guildmates have no interest in going there anymore - the risk versus the reward simply isn't there, and the bind points are way too hard to travel to/from for the melee types.  Most of my guild has gone back to Kunark.<P>Velious wasn't ready for release.  It was apparent from the unfinished graphics.  From the white scaled tunic (which isn't white) to the rehashed caster robes with a few different colors, to total holes in textures for certain armors, it was plain that it simply wasn't ready.<P>To fix Velious: retune the magic resistances so that casters can actually expect to land enough spells to make it worth casting them.  Velketors and Skyshrine need to have the drop rates increased to make it actually worthwhile to fight there.  Drop spells - eliminate this concept, or provide an alternative.  Replace it with quests for the spells.  It is unfair to force casters to hunt particular zones for particular mobs in hopes that a particular spell will drop - or pay an insane amount of money for that spell simply because someone else got lucky.  This applies as much to Kunark as to Velious.  I hope that you are wanting more EverQuest, and not as much EverCamp...but that is what you are causing by having the spells drop the way they do.<P>The reason that there has been a drop-off in the people actually staying in velious is that you can go to a certain point, but after that, you had better be packing 2 or 3 groups of level 50+ friends in your pockets, or forget it.  And what kind of fun is that?  The non-planar Velious zones should be capable of being explored by a maximum of 2 groups of the appropriate level, epic encounters aside.  The drop rates should be sufficient that a player could reasonably expect that the item they are after will drop within a reasonable period of time (about 4-6 hours I would say).  And the loot needs to be something that a person of the appropriate level, or slightly higher, would actually find some value in using.  Crystal Caverns is perfect in this regard.  Every other zone in Velious is not.  And as for the really nice items, such as the wedding bands and such from the tower of frozen shadows, make them no drop and bump up the drop rate.  Get the high level campers/farmers out of there, so that the zone can be enjoyed by those it was meant for.<BR>Have the mobs con and give exp accordingly.  And why on earth would a supposedly intelligent race, like the frost and storm giants, attack someone that cons ruby red to them?  I can understand it makes travel more challenging if you chose a different faction path, but still...  And if it can kick my butt, and my pets butt, it shouldn't con green to me.<P>Take crystal caverns as a model for risk/reward and drop rates.  Its perfect.  For one group of the appropriate level, its fun and moderately risky.  Higher level people can pass through, get an item they may want, and be on their way.  The design and visual appeal are wonderful.<P>If I am going to go into Kael, a corpse drag aggro zone, and fight 50+ mobs with 2x the normal amount of hit points and hit 2x as hard as a comparable Kunark mob, well then, they damn well better drop loot that equals the risk.<P>The thurgadin quest armors are way too hard, when Plane of Growth is more like candyland.  PoG needs to be a 3 group zone, not a 1-2 group zone.  about  20-30% harder.<P>Velious would totally kick butt if it were retuned to cater more to the 1-2 group environment; if the drop rates were retuned to where you could go in and expect to at least see what you were after drop within 4-6 hours, even if you weren't the person/group  that got it.  The higher end stuff should be no drop, like the sentry robe, and the wedding band set, etc.  Get the farmers/campers out, and let the people who are intended to be there in.<P>Akherat<BR>Elementalist to SoC<BR>The Tribunal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052487-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052487.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052487-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052487-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052487-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052487-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052487&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052487&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
