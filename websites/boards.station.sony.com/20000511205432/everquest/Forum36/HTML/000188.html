&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Well, a whiles back, on everlore.com I posted how EQ was getting boring, with the same fighting over and over again. Many of you replied that the game was only as fun as I made it to be, and I should try something different. Today I decided to follow that advice.<BR>It began early in the afternoon, as I found that Lightadam, the coolest lvl 47 wiz ever, was booted from my guild, Bane of the Wicked, due to the fact that Eodron, our guild leader, is an idiot and a liar. So I promptly removed myself as well, seeing as how Light invited me and hooked me up with ultra gear stuff. I decided to spend the day in Crushbone, to see if I could get a Dragoon Dirk. Seeing as how nobody was going to pull him out, and I was too lazy to do it myself, I went to the trainer hill to see if I could get a SBS for my rogue gnome. Unfortunately, a lvl 20+ wiz and a weaker elf mage were already there. The weak one, Nahtan, was already injured from a previous fight. Images of my friend Spankee pking flashed through my head. Should I or shouldn't I? I did. Creeping Crud engulfed him, and he walked to the zone. I forgot about him and looked at the 20ish wiz, Aalaminea. She was medding, didn't see anything. So I went to the CB entrance, and lo and behold, there was Nahtan, with NO hp left whatsoever, but CC had run out. Just his luck. I cast CC again, as he turned and tried to run to zone, before I heard the familiar "Ah..oh..ugh.." sound of someone dying. I laughed. Next I saw Errion, an elf magi attacking some oracles with his pet. I cast on him as well. He was high blue to me, and I snared him. The oracle began to beat him savagely. I began to snare him again, in anticipation of it wearing off. I did it just after he did cancel magic on my previous snare. I laughed again. His pet was attacking me, but to no avail. Rooted even, I continued to bomb him, and he fell. 3pp. Not great, but it'll do. I rested up, meditated, got my strength back. I saw Aalaminea, hunting cents. Why? I don't know. But I started nuking away as well, and casted CC on her. She barely made it to zone(Damn corners, can't cast around them). Luckily, Fyrewolf ran by me attacking oracles as well. Why were all these high blues attacking deep greens? Maybe they were twinking. Fyrewolf had lvled up pretty quickly from when I last saw him. He had just gotten wolf form. I decided to get rid of it. Snare. He reverted back to elf form, as the oracles began beating up on him again. I began to nuke away. It didn't take much, as he was already weakened. As if I cared. He fell, and so did my faction..again. 9 copper. But that wasn't the end of it. I got a tell from him.<BR>Fyrewolf tells you, 'A--hole! Pking and making me lost exp is illegal. I hope you enjoy your last days on this game!<BR>You tell Fyrewolf, ' But I looted you! 9 copper!'<BR>Fyrewolf tells you, ' I lost lvl 24!! A--hole, I'm petitioning you'<BR>My sides were splitting from laughter. Next to fall was Shaod. I remembered him mocking my lower lvl when I was lvl 7. Times change. Although he took more casts than those who were higher lvl than him, he soon fell. At least he put up a fight. Soon word got around. Earlier, I had told newbies I would give them magic armor and weapons if they could wave to me from Dvinn's spot in the castle. Crushbone was littered with the corpses of newbies, especially in and around the castle. Oh well, their stupidity, not mine. Eventually Aalaminea and Diabla, along with some elf mage whose name I didn't get, began casting on me. Unfortunately for them, I quickly dove into the water. They still continued casting, to no avail, as they were on land, and I was on water. They shouted for me to come out, calling me cowardly for not facing them. But who was the coward? Me who attacked them, whether they were fighting or just plain running around, or they, who insisted they fought with honor, but teamed up in groups to fight one halfling alone? I continued to take potshots at them, weaving in and out of water, and none of their spells were able to connect. Yet they still didn't see why their spells had no effect on me. I laughed and laughed and laughed. I mocked them, teased them, and it only made them angier. But, eventually, all fun has to come to an end. So I made plans to gate back to the Greater Faydark. I was in the slaver caves, next to an outlet that led to the river. I said my goodbyes. But no sooner had I clicked gate than I was attacked by an earth elemental. I turned. It was hitting for low dmg, and was quite small. I destroyed it in a few casts, and soon disappeared myself. I reappeared on the other side of the CB zone, ironically only a few feet away from a zone where people had gathered to kill me. I SOWed every non-elf I saw and camped. Today was a good day.<BR>Yep, all this happened today, only a few minutes ago, just thought you'd like to know that there's more to EQ than just lvling.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
