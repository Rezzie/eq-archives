</FONT><HR>I think VI got several of the epics right.  The ranger epic is really nice - a good proc on one and a good effect on the other.  The rogue one allows rogues to do what they do best - damage.  The enchanter one gives an insane buff, which not only makes them the undisputable speed buffers, but also frees up some mana to do other things.  The mage epic is downright awesome  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  I just love the fact that their epic is a spell that summons something that summons a pet!<P>Now the necros do have a beef for the flaming bag of poop that they have, and some of the other classes could use an upgrade, but I would say that the res stick is comparable to several of the other epics, and that none of them unbalance the game.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Taijira,<P>Your wrong ... I disagree that the res stick should get changed, but your still wrong.<P>Lord Yelinak is a prime example for why the cleric breastplate from trakanon got nerfed, as were the dragons in West Wastes.<P>For those that know nothing of him, Lord Yelinak is a level 65-70ish dragon in Skyshrine.  He has a few interesting spells in his repertoire, including an AE mana drain, AE shock of force (about a 300dd that knocks people back), an AE ice based spell that does roughly 700dd, probably an AE fear, quads for 500's, his room is completely covered in ice (which means you slide on the floor ... ie., when tanks get slammed for quad 500's they move back further than normal, and when hit by that AE shock of force, go sliding way off into the walls and off into the water), can not be pulled, and has 250k hitpoints.<P>So, this means you MUST have some form of levitate if you have any prayer of staying within his range so you can continue to melee him or heal tanks, so levitate has to be buried far enough back that it doesn't get dispelled, that is if he uses any dispells.<P>The worste part, in the end, ended up being the AE mana drain.  Clerics and other casters were running out of mana too quickly to be able to keep the tanks alive.<P>Therefore people that had the donal's breastplates on all their clerics started using this to keep their tanks alive, and would try to distribute hate amongst the various tanks to spread the damage out, to counteract the casting times on the breastplates.<P>When Verant found out that it was possible to kill Lord Yelinak so quickly and easily with the breastplate, that's when it all started.<P>From there on out they found other uses, including allowing a single warrior, and a single cleric to take dragons in western wastes out.  Provided said warrior didn't lose more than around 4800 hitpoints for the duration of the cast of the cheal on the breastplate, the warrior would stay standing.<P>So in my mind, that answers the question as to why the Donal's breastplate was nerfed.  If you don't believe it, try asking & see if Verant will reply.<P>Now, as to why cheal got nerfed, you all know why it got nerfed.  a_cleric00 said it himself ... he said that the breastplate isn't the problem, cheal is.  It was quoted, and thrown around amongst all the various 'i'm a pissed off cleric' threads for a week or more.  My, how quickly you've all forgotten, and placed the blame at the feat of the druids, the same people who you were whining about taking YOUR spots in groups because they were suddenly becoming *gasp* more usefull!<P>Quit your whining backbiting, backstabbing behaviour, it's very unbecoming of you.<P>-Desbarolis -- 47th bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Toklin:<P>Since You brought up the cookie analogy, let me develop it to its fullest extent so not even YOU can miss the point of the ress stick (or, if You wish, the whole cleric class and community):<P>Imagine this really nice guy or lady who knows how much others like cookies. So he/she decides to become *really* good at making cookies. He/she gets so good that she can make different kinds to suit different purposes. There's this cookie that makes You feel better when You are ill (heal). Then there's the kind of cookies that are really nourishing and that can make You stay without cookies for an extended time (buffs). And finally it's this wonderous cookie... The one that is the hardest to make... It can actually raise the dead (most get what analogy this is but since this post is meant for Toklin I'll clarify: ress). The trouble is that many times the process of making this kind of cookie is so fatiguing that the nice guy/lady has to rest for extended periods.<P>After a while it becomes quite clear that making cookies gets kinda tedious. It's actually all the nice guy/lady gets to do - the demand for cookies seems endless but since our cookie maker knows how much people need the cookies he/she trudges on. But the demand for that wonderous cookie that can rasie the dead seems especially high. People call in from all over the land to get this one. But the nice guy/lady can only make so many cookies and sometimes he/she has to turn people down. Some people just can't handle that - they try to convince him/her that they must have their cookie. Sometimes they even curse or threat the nice guy/lady.<P>Then our cookie maker gets to hear of this wonderous device. It can make the ressurecting cookies automatically - without the strain and the effort. So he/she sets out to find this wonderful cookie machine. The journey is long and full of peril but at the end he/she has it and the nice guy/lady rejoices - Now he can give cookies to so many more.<P>But one day this little boy speaks up. He demands that the cookie makers machine should be destroyed. Bewildered the cookie maker asks the boy "don't You like cookies"? "Of course I do", the boy answers. "But then why? I don't understand. Please explain why You want to destroy this device that can help so many and that I have worked so hard and long to attain."<P>"Because it is TOO powerful", the boy answers. "You are able to make too many cookies with it."<P>The cookie maker smiles and says "I don't think that I or any of the people that I've been able to help want this machine destroyed but I will meet You half way, if it makes You happier". The nic guy/lady pulls out a little black book from his backpack where in he scribbles down the little boys name. He flashes another smile at the boy and says "there You go. No more cookies for You."<P>Pirmin Nimblefoot<BR>Karana Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Desbarolis: All valid points, it's quite apparent that they don't want their creations to be defeated. FoH's raid on The Sleeper (And more so, the buffing of the Warders following it) proved this beyond anyone's doubt. So that was the main reason why CH got nerfed. But I still can't say that the druids who complained about it had no hand in it. They gave them a heal equivalent to Divine Light. That leaves CH as the only Cleric-exclusive immediate heal left. And then that gets nerfed so Divine Light is superior in exp groups. So I still think that the druids who complained about CH were responsible to an extent. But then, we should be talking about Wizards. They compete with Druids for group slots, specifically the evac spot in dungeons. And the healing enhancements they got was a severe nerf to Wizards since Wizards will never, ever get picked over a Druid for a dungeon group 50+ any more. And I'm sick of seeing Druids ask for other people to get nerfed on these boards, while continuing to get enhancements while other classes struggle. Like I said I have nothing against Druids, just the ones that whine. Druids are a great class that doesn't need any more enhancements, and it's time they start enhancing other classes to be that versatile.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Taijira,<P>There's good and bad clerics and druids out there.  There just happens to be more druids than clerics, hence by numerical value there happens to be a lot more bad druids than bad clerics.  But by percentage, I personally believe there's a lot more bad clerics out there.<P>What's a bad cleric?  His personality screams it.  He's the cleric that doesn't realize his buffs rock, his heals are better, he can resurect people, aside from wizards he's the best chain stunning class, and yet STILL get's upset when druid's get a heal spell or two that makes them a little more group friendly, and makes other people more willing to allow a druid to fill the spot that would normally REQUIRE a cleric.<P>In case you haven't noticed bud, there isn't always a cleric available to fill group spots.  Sometimes people want to hit a dungeon and don't have a cleric and a chanter.  So I see no point in chanters and clerics getting upset if it's possible now for a group of people to hit a dungeon with a druid or shaman healing, and a bard doing crowd control.

</FONT><HR>The rez sticks *are* overpowered, on PK servers.<P>(listens to horde of blubies leaving the message for the next one)<P>On a PK server, when battling for control of a zone against an opposing force, if one side has clerics armed with rez sticks and the other doesn't, the rezstick side wins everytime.<P>1) Train the area (this goes for any 50+ raid zone, especially planes), making sure one of your rezstick clerics live (camp out, zone out, etc...).<P>2) Rez stick all of your people.<P>Congratulations.  You just paid 4% XP of death loss for the right to gain control of the zone.  You now have two options (as generally taken on PK servers)<BR> a) continue to pk as people you train-killed come in small groups as they arrive back at zone attempting to get their corpses.<BR> b) tell them you'll rez stick them, but that they have to leave immediately.<P>If either a or b aren't acceptable to the losing side, rez stick side simply wipes the zone again (trains), and repeats until the non-rezstick side gets the hint and leaves.<P>So while I think they're cool, they're also uber power on a red server, and thus overpowered.<P>And before anyone from a blue server says to /petition for a GM, try that on a red server.  Red server GMs don't do *anything* if there was even thought of PK involved in whatever you petitioned.  They tell you "this is a pk server, and anything goes".<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

With a rez stick you can rez people alot faster, and you certainly dont need any more clerics since only one is needed with the stick to rez everyone.<P>How does this make us more powerful?  We ALREADY had the friggen spell.  Nobody needs a res stick in exp groups, since its not like it takes ages to med for a couple reses.  <P>I would MUCH rather have the magician epic or the necro epic (so I can snare) than this.  It doesnt help me get into groups/doesnt make me get any more fun.  It only helps OTHER people, not me.  <P>Now the fact you are complaining about that is just ludicrous.
