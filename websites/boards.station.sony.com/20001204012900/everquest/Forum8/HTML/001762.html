</FONT><HR>OK... I'm only at lvl 33 and I know I should be levelling but I do like to practice Alchemy.  Of course, I have to level to increase my skill... problem one.<P>Problem two... I have yet to find a potion besides SOW that is truly marketable.  I have made a few other potions like Invisibility to Undead, Levitate, and Blistering Skin but NOBODY wants to pay 20pp or more for them.  Even at 20pp the cost of practicing is not recovered.  <P>Perhaps someone could shed some light on why Alchemy is so limited, so expensive, and in so very little demand.  Suggestions for potions that could be in demand don't seem to be receiving any official response.  I feel that if Verant wants this skill to be important to the game, then some of these things need to be addressed.<P>Suggestion:  Since it seems that Breeze and Clarity are to remain Enchanter only spells, and to keep the player interaction element which is so important to Verant, perhaps a potion with a component like an enchanted water flask could be added and the enchanters could get an enchant water spell.  Somewhat like a non-enchanter jeweller needs an enchanter's assitance to create enchanted jewelry.

</FONT><HR>Neato idea.<P>Charged potions might give some of those a better market.  I'd buy str buff potions if they had more than 1 charge (I believe there is an easy +5 str -5 agi potion, with 3 to 4 pp worth of materials, and a harder 10 str -10 sta potion with &lt; 30 pp worth of materials.  I would pay good money for a 10 or 5 charger of either of those!), but as it stands I need the inventory space for the MQ ore, can't afford using up a backpack on potions.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yes, you're absolutely right!  Potions should stack... it would make them much more attractive.<P>Another thing I didn't mention before is that I never see herbs for known potions drop off MOB's.  I have seen some herbs, but the ones we need to use I have only found on NPC vendors.  At least if we knew they were dropping off MOB's we could spend our time fighting for them and would be able to save a little pp.  It's like the silks off spiders or the pelts off other critters.  <P>Trellak Leatherheart<BR>Torvonnilous<BR>"Where do I plug in my Totemic Laptop around here?"<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A very good and true post.<P>I have a lvl 44 Troll shamen, and to date i have spent over 5500K pp to raise his alchemy skill to 54, and the first 20 points were achived through training points. Of that money, almost nothing was recovered by selling my successes to players.<P>The biggest problem with the skill is that many of the recipes are still need to have thier costs halved. Verant wants to make "across the board" changes, and that worked the first time, but most of the higher trivial lvl potions are way to expensive for their usefulness. Someone needs to sit down and look at each potion, and weigh the "Cost vs Reward" which really is "Risk vs Reward" for the shamen.<P>Perhaps the costs of the potions could remain the same, if they would simply let them sell back to merchants at slightly below cost, as nearly every other trade skill does. It is not fair to spend 10 or 15pp trying to make a potion,(with an already high fail rate that no one will buy), just to raise your skill, and then have that potion sell back to a merchant for 4 gold.<P>I know verant views this and most other trade skills as "money sinks", but the size of the drain is simply too big. They just don't understand, because no one at verant has ever used their hard earned money on this skill.<P>Verant if you want proof of what i'm saying, try this:<P>Create a lvl 35 Shamen. Go out into the world and play and kill whatever you can, until you have saved up 1000pp. (note just how long this takes, and how much effort is put into it.)<P>Then go practice alchemy with that 1000pp, until it is all gone. (assume you put 20 training points into the skill at the start). See just how many trys you get, how many complete failures, and what potions you have, (in terms of usefulness or re-sale value to players). Then, as a last stab in the heart, take your worthless potions that cost 10pp to make, (that you can't sell to players), to a merchant and sell them for 4 gold.<P>I think you will find that you basicly wasted hours upon hours of gameplay earning that money that you basicly through away, on a skill you were excited about, and had faith in. <P>(Before you quote this and say it...NO it was not fun playing during that time and earning that money when, in the end, it is all wasted in just a faction of the time it took to earn it.) It is truely a waste of a person's time and efforts in its current state. <P>The skill has the *potential* to be useful and fun to the shamen doing it, but it needs adjustment.<P>Do the above, and you might get some taste of the heart-ache that the players feel, and why we are complaining and demanding change. It is a "Risk vs Reward" issue, and thats one of your favorite topics.<P>Maddax Steelwind   Lvl 50 Ranger<BR>Goulag WitchDoctor Lvl 44 Shamen<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, in my case, I haven't had any trouble selling SOW potions. I often fill up backpacks of the herbs needed to make it and construct it for my customers. I started out selling at 15p per, and after I got trivial at it, I usually sell it for 12p per, or even 10p per when I get a large order. <P>As for other potions, I once managed to sell Kilva's Blistering Flesh, and a couple of times Invisibility to Undead. I do sell quite a lot of ANT potions, for 17-20p. I subsidized failures from making ANT potions with my SOW potion money. I've got regular customers, and I deliver with a smile on my warty trollish face.<P>So far with the money I made from selling potions, I've bought a platinum ruby veil, an enchanted fine steel staff, Chipped Bone Bracers, a Blood Stained Tunic, a Charred Guardian Shield, and various other stuff I gave to friends and guild members. I've saved up enough to buy a Totemic Helm (screw camping the glacier bear, I'm supporting the FARMERS!) So I would say investing time in alchemy is definitely worth it. 0]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well Meschit, you would appear to be one of the lucky ones. Though i would agree there always seems to be a market for SOW potions, and to a much lesser extent Shrink potions, many of the others are just way too expensive for the benefit they have.<P>If anything, i would just like to see the potions sell back to the merchant for at least 80% of the cost to make them, so the shamen can make back some of the money spent to practice on potions that players will not buy. <P>This is not an unreasonable request, since almost all other trade skills already do this. I don't mind spending alot of money to practice, or the high failure rates, if i can at least recoup most of the money off of my successes by selling it to a merchant for a *small* loss.<P>I think anyone would agree that a 10pp potion selling to a merchant for 4 gold is ridiculas. I realize they want to spawn player to player trade, but the other trade skills get 90%+ of their money back selling to merchants, why shouldn't shamen?? <BR>Remember, we are still taking a loss; it just needs to be a 20% loss and not a 97% loss. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Interesting posts and wholly true.  I have had similar experiences on Povar.  The initial burst to 37-40 is exceedingly costs, then, as you become better at SoW, you CAN slowly make cash selling them.  I used this to fund my elevation to 70 or so.  At this point, you are basically stuck, and no potion you make 70-100 is really going to sell worth anything.  Its a total loss.<P>Oh, and incidentally, there are one or two potions with herbs that drop (Horehound for one) but I haven't seen data on what those potions do.<P>IMO, to fix alchemy, a few things could be done:<BR>1.) Make the durn things stackable.  They are a single use expendable item weighing 0.1.  All they do as is is clutter up inventory and limit their own usefulness.<BR>2.) Lower prices on the "higher" end herbs.  Most players that could benefit from the potions adamantly refuse to pay 30p or more for a potion despite its obvious benefit.  Stat potions sell horribly, b/c most folks KNOW that stats afford minor advantages only.  The only stat potions that WOULD sell (wis and int) we are denied access to.<BR>3.) Re-invent a few of the potions.  Some limited illusion potions would be not only entertaining, but provide the evil characters a viable, if dangerous way to access vendors and cities.  I personally favor amusing ones like : fairy, imp, bear, bat.  And yes, I have heard the tired statement that the global files have limited space available.  So expand it, you ppl are netting $2 M a month according to the financial reports I've seen.<BR>4.) Ask the players what sort of potions they'd find useful.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree, and really hope that someone from Verant reads this thread.  Alchemy as it is plays almost NO importance in the game and it should not be that way!  I have had the opportunity to make some dyes for a guild mate, however it was a trivial skill and I still haven't seen much demand for this either.  <P>Another suggestion I would like to make is that since we can make dyes for armor, perhaps we Alchemists could be allowed to make stat enhancing vials to be included as a component in making armor either by tailoring or smithing.  Maybe at different levels of skill, a potion could be made that would add +3, +5, etc. in certain stats like STR, AGI, DEX, etc.  Then we could market these in the manner that the jeweller does his or her jewelry.  <P>I sincerely hope someone at Verant sees this thread!  It seems like we all have had good ideas in this area and we are not wanting to be given anything outrageous.<P>Thanks for the posts here too!   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Trellak Leatherheart<BR>Torv</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As a master smith, I needed to make dyes for fine steel armor. To make the dye extract, the components need to be combined in a medicine bag by an alchemist or in whatever the rogues use to make poison.  After making about ten dye extracts, my alchemy skill went from 21 to 24. Getting 23 and 24 were the last two tries.  After making a hundred or so Sow potions, this was the first time it had advanced at all.  So now, I activly search for dye components to not only increase the value of the armor I make but to also increase my alchemy skill.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
