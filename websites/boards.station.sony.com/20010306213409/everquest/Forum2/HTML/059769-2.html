</FONT><HR>"But you'd probably just say those other clerics don't know how to play their characters."<P>That is completely incorrect Tiktokman.<P>Healing in the post 50 world with mobs triple attacking your enchanter for 150 points has absolutely nothing to do mana efficiency.  It is all about how fast you can regen health until the situation is controlled.<P>Superior Healing - 105 hp/sec<BR>Remedy - 150 hp/sec<BR>Divine Light - 173 hp/sec<P>Now while it would seem that divine light is the way to go here to get the maximum healing on target it has a two second longer cast time and a serious problem with fizzles.  You just cannot trust that the spell is going to cast and this is not the time to find out.  Remedy was the only way to reliably insure that enchanter didn't become a corpse and THAT is a cleric's biggest challenge post 50.  The tanks have 4K hps and 1100 AC, they are the EASY ones to keep alive.<P>With clarity 2 and/or a bard running out of mana is much less of a concern than it used to be.  That makes complete heal nice to have in these routine groups, but not at all necessary.  That is why I consider remedy a clerics class defining spell post 50.  Anyone could heal a tank given enough mana, we were the only ones who could heal a caster fast enough to keep them alive.<P>Ezrick</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You know, I do think clerics got the nerf axe a little here, and I feel your pain.  However, what is beyond me is the age old argement "why would you choose a cleric now?  heck druids and shaman get all these other nifty spells...blah...blah"<P>Come on guys.  Do you really think if the druid or shaman in the group is the primary healer, he/she is going to be casting all these other nifty spells?  You and I both know that his/her role will be reducded to the exact same as yours is now.  Heal...sit(med)...heal...sit(med).  Explain to me how a shaman for instance is going to manage to slow 5 mobs, then take care of healing the entire group.<P>You seem to be leaving this out of the mix for some reason.  The only thing i'll go along with is that Druids have evac..thats it..nothing more.<P>Although, I stated ealier that I did belive this is a nerf to clerics, i'm wondering if this could be a good thing for you.  I don't play a cleric so I can't be sure on this, and i'm sure you will show me there error of my ways here.  But, won't this free you up to do more than just sit and heal.  If you have a druid and shaman in the group, want you be able to use some of the stuns for example?  I've read so many times that your class is boring, and I agree totally.  I'm just wondering if this may help that somewhat.<P>Once agian, I do belive clerics got the nerf, but I also belive that there may be a as yet undiscovered boon here too.<P>Hearst</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I wish that Clerics didn't feel so badly about the changes that are being made, hopefully they won't be as bad as everyone is assuming they will be.  I have seen many Clerics upset about Druids and Shaman (what is the plural of shaman?) getting better heals.  I also see all the Clerics really upset about the "nerf" on CH with it causing much more agro.  There's a lightbulb going off for me, and that is that maybe the improved heals from the other classes will help to keep a Cleric alive (read: will not have to CHeal so much) and this agro change won't be as big a deal.  The whole class balance talks were *intended* to be just that, balance.  I see this as more people can help add to the party, it is encouraging more people to participate in the higher level raids.<P>Don't get me wrong, I think if I played a cleric I would be upset too.  I think you have a right to be upset.  But I also think that this isn't going to be the earth-shattering change that everyone is claiming it will be.<P>One more thing, maybe you can blame those clerics who said (and I quote) "...all we do is CH, MED, CH, MED..." for causing the heal aggro change.  Now it will be "CH, pray that a backup healer has your back and someone is doing a good deal of taunting somehow, die...".  Makes it a bit more exciting, eh?  =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Actually the scary thing here is that of all the changes I mentioned I actually applaud the increase in hate due to healing.<P>I think most clerics will agree that pre 50 there used to be a lot of strategy involved on the cleric's part on who to heal and when to heal.  You could tell a good cleric because he/she could keep a group healed while not drawing aggro often, or intentionally drawing aggro to save a caster.<P>Now I can chain cast four or five Remedies at the very start of a fight on an enchanter with a resisted mez and never draw aggro.  That really doesn't seem right.  Plus its to our advantage to be able to draw aggro off a caster onto a heavily armored cleric.<P>Ezrick<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm surprised none of you mentioned the Monk skill, Mend. It may not seem like a big nerf, but its pretty devastating if your in a battle trying to use Mend.<P>This is what they did: When you use Mend, and it grays-out and you have to wait the certain amount of time for it to come back so you can use it again, right?<BR>Well, they decided to put a 2 second limit on it when it ungrays and its ready to use. You have to wait 2 seconds, then click on Mend. BUT! If you click on Mend right when it comes back, and dont wait the 2 seconds, You have to wait a FULL cycle again for it to come back. This cost me a death so far today, and it will cause many more deaths to come.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"Post 50 is is generally a single group dungeon camp. 90% of your time is spent in these type groups grinding out the huge volume of xp required for each level."<P>Wrong, imo. Post-Fifty sees most of my time spent on Planes raids and "pieces of Epic" raids. These tend (for me) to be no exp raids with multiple Clerics present. Like many others, I see no problem with Druids and Shammies getting long overdue healing boosts, but the increased agro of healing is another matter all together. I'm guessing that what will eventually drive high level players from the game is not slow leveling, difficulty of Epic quests, nor even new games on the market (plenty of fun to be had in EQ until EQ2). What will drive folks from the game is very lengthy CRs due to dead Clerics.<P>Just my 2cp.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A couple of thoughts.<P>Hate list changes... Clerics are a plate class, Shaman are a chain class, druids are a leather class. So one perspective is that clerics lost some of their stranglehold on efficient healing, but have better surviveability when they use that healing. Plus no other class has the short term invulnerability they do as a trump card. Show me a cleric that has never had a cause to use that?<P>Also, as many others have brought up, if you use a utility class (shaman or druid) as a "cleric-light", you are giving up all the other benefits they could provide the group due to mana usage. Doesn't that make you a bit squeamish thinking that your primary healer has to choose between the heal that keeps you alive or evac? Or that the shaman still has to decide between slow and heal for efficiency? Especially now that slow doesn't generate the amount of aggro that it used to.<P>In my opinion Verant has made some good adjustments. The most efficient group is STILL the current model of CLERIC/ENCHANTER/WARRIOR/(rogue or whatnot), it's just that some other combinations are now viable in a wider variety of settings, and that's good for everybody.<P>Yes clerics are boring to play. So are warriors. There are different classes to suit a wide variety of playstyles - if you find that the one you are playing does not suit yours maybe you should try a different class. If verant succeeds in balancing them and making no single class necessary, then you should have no reservations in choosing the one with the playstyle that best matches your preferences.<P>Now I do agree that druids fit the "monty haul" RPG mentality more than any other class. They have the most versatility, adequate offense to solo, and are probably responsible for about 75% of the item farming that goes on. So I can see where giving them a better heal is somewhat upsetting given all the apparent advantages they have - but remember that the heal upgrades are to encourage grouping, and not particularly relevant when soloing. Now those druids can be solicited to join a dungeon group that would have otherwise had to give up due to lack of healing, and that is good for everyone. Although (/sarcasm on) if Verant really wanted to get some cash out of the economy and limit the use of these adjusted healing spells, they could require a 1pp component to cast them.

</FONT><HR>Ezrick - "Anyone could heal a tank given enough mana, we were the only ones who could heal a caster fast enough to keep them alive."<P>Any cleric can keep a tank alive, but not druids or shaman.  They can't before or after the patch.  Their heals aren't efficient enough to heal them.  This won't change, and this will be the reason Clerics are still the only viable healer for a group.<P>Things will be a little better now, but not earth shattering.  The agro issue is a new one.

</FONT><HR>You guys have definately forgotten one thing when saying that a druid / shaman will constantly replace clerics in the exp gaining game...  Karnors SolB dogs etc.  You say the druid can now HEAL on top of DoT's,  Dmg shields,  regen,  DD's... and the such.  The thing you're forgetting is all those things take MANA.  lots of it.  So if a druid is to replace a cleric,  they have to pretty much sit back and ONLY heal.  So they become a cleric with weaker less efficient heals.  Trust me,  clerics are still wanted in groups,  if anyone turns one down in my group I will personally /bonk them till it hurts.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've been playing a druid a long time, and I don't recal being a primary healer since right after I picked up GHeal. Even then, I was only primary healer four or five times, and hated it because I never had enough mana to do normal druid things (snare, strength, ds, etc), or because I was always getting beat on with my pansy AC. <P>That will not change now. I understand and completely accept the fact that I will NEVER be a primary healer now, or when I'm lvl 60. My AC sucks too much, and when the tank has over 5000 hit points, my spells are going to raise him just less than 1 1/2 bubs of health anyway.<P>My job is to heal the casters in the group while the cleric is casting CHeal, and to supplement the cleric's CHeal when mobs decide they're suddenly going to beat the last bubble out of a tank twice as fast as the previous four.<P>Other than that, I'm an evac monkey.<P>On the bright side, I might get invited on a raid now... though probably not 'cuz shamans can take care of the healing I'd normally do, and wizzies are better to have for evac since they've got Lures.<P>Guess I'll go make a wizard, cuz I just found out that post level 50, druids become cannon fodder.<P>Oh well.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think the beauty of what I see here is that it's not just the fact that druid and shaman got better heals.  It's not just the fact that cleric heals just had a higher hate then the warrior in the groups taunt can effectively change (wait until the first raids btw to see what damage this will REALLY have).  This doesn't even have to do with the fact that clerics are still in demand for spots in groups generally.<P>The problem is that clerics have been static for so long now that there aren't any clerics truly enjoying playing their classes at all.  At least not any of the post 50 clerics.<P>I login and despise the fact that I'm not 60 and retired from active duty yet!<P>Verant has not added anything to the game that could make a cleric feel like they would have fun.<P>I've seen more clerics retired in the past 3 months then my server had in total less then a year ago.  I've threatened it and never did it but, to tell you the truth, I held out to see what Verant would do to make the class I used to enjoy the most more exciting.  The did nothing other then make it more and more difficult to justify playing a cleric.<P>All of you that say clerics are complaining and whining for nothing must have never played a cleric before or, if you have, you retired it and hope that nobody remembers that you have it so don't get all high and mighty with me or the rest of the clerics that have a valid beef to settle.<P>As a matter of fact one of the people I would love to meet in game is TheAlchemist.  Ask me, Mr. Alchemist, how much clerical help, rez's or anything else your incompetent self would get... come on ask me!

The pre-patch clerics had some a form of stealth mode on their complete heals (equivalent to Greater Heal....no wonder) that explains why no high level mob beats on them too much.  <BR>Oh well, now that VI fixed that bug, the clerics will be on the radar screen of those high level mobs now whenever they cast too many complete heals.  The other casters were already on this hate list to these mobs whenever they nuked or debuffed mob; therefore, it is fair that Clerics Heals should be on affect this hate list.<BR>......<BR>......<BR>After this patch, I think the life as a Cleric will be more exciting.

</FONT><HR>In any group containing both a cleric and a druid/shaman, the cleric will always be the primary healer.  I can't foresee that changing.  I, as a shaman, would actually rather not be main healer, as I have a lot of other useful spells that I would rather cast.  Before this patch, when the cleric left the group, you either found another cleric, or the group was finished.  A druid/shaman simply did not have the healing capabilities, even with clarity and/or manasong.  Now, a druid/shaman can pick up the slack and the group will continue.  <P>People have complained that playing a cleric is boring, as all one does is med, heal, buff, and med some more.  Well, now you don't necessarily have to.  Spread the healing around between the cleric and the druid/shaman, and you can do other things: throw in a nuke now and then, maybe even melee a bit.<P>This 'nerf' fury will blow over, just like all the ones before it.  For all that EQ players call for change, when it comes about, they resist and complain and say that Verant is trying to destroy them.

Forget balancing, viability etc etc, whether or not the code or statistics showed some classes more powerful than others or not, the only net affect that has real meaning is the players perception to the changes.<P>For the cleric class that feels kind of hard done by to begin with to apparently get nerfed pretty drastically in one hit, the perceptions are going to be pretty hard to negate in-game. For druids, anybody in their right mind considering starting a new character would be dumb not to choose a druid if they haven't got one.<P>To return to my point - it would be nice if VI routinely published what the playing populations are, both in terms of characters established and hours played.

</FONT><HR>Well, as a 55th Cleric that loves my class, I will say these few things.<P><BR>I will reserve my CH for Warriors only, and I will now be even more reserved with how I cast it. It will force me to keep those symbols & buffs up at 12pp per symbol and I WILL require more gems because of this. You complain, I leave group.<P>I will now wait until that Warrior is down to a bub (or maybe less if they are an Ogre) before I start casting CH, and ANY Shaman or Druid in my group damn well better make sure that that Tank DOES NOT get to 1 bubble with their new heals they wanted so badly. They wanted them ... THEY WILL USE THEM or I will not stick around. I also better have any and all Druids & Shamans watching my back when I start getting beat on, and if I don't start getting healed as quickly as I heal a chanter then I will leave as well. <P>I am gonna do my damn best to re-think my strategies and learn how to heal better without CH. I will use Celestial far more ... and that may make all party members more nervous, but this nerf aint just about clerics paying the price all people I heal are gonna feel this nerf too. I will take some responsibility and improve my strategy to keep you all alive, and stay even MORE alert. If I don't have a Clarity on me at all times I will complain because now my buffs are more about survival than ever before, if you want those buffs to make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside then you will pay for them by waiting longer to pull, and allow me to med-up more or you won't get healed its that simple.<P>If I even HEAR about a class not taunting a mob, I don't care what class or what the situation ... then I will give 1 warning, if it happens again I'm gone.<P>You all say that clerics can get a group whenever & wherever they want and it aint fair ... well I will excercise that boon and leave my party in a heartbeat if they aren't ALL pullin their weight, and will go get another group somewhere else immediatley like you all say we can.<P>Bottomline for me ... I will not allow myself to be the only victim to this patch, I accept it, and I will change my game tactics to remain a good cleric, but my patience with others will now be at a minimum, and idiots that don't help to keep the party alive will be left behind.<P>Lets, get back to playin  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>all i can do is /sigh i will never reach level 60.look everyone is complaining about the dr00ds and shammys.hey i'm happy about that being high level.that means i will live longer or caster will live longer while i'm casting CH they can take care of the others.now this thing about HATE it changed my gameplay 100%.we are known for CH and buffs nobody can touch us yet now if i CH my war for 3k HP (yes i have it timed perfect) i'm looking at instant death being they cant taunt it off and if i divine fine what happens if i have to heal again i'm screwed.oh wait i have a 2nd divine so i use that.ok now if we do kill the mob before i have to CH a 3rd time i'm dead,but if we do kill the MOB we will have to wait for my divine to pop up again before we can pull.and on top of all this i'm talking about 1 MOB not 2-3 of them.when we are taking on level 50-58 MOBS with 1 group (we do all the time) i have to CH my war 2-3 times even though the war has 1100AC.so pretty much i'm looking at death.now as far as the BP getting nerfed i'm happy for it being it takes no skill to chain CH.everyone thinks theres no skill playing a cleric.YOU ARE DEAD WRONG.theres ton of skill involved.when do i start CH,ok healed him crap ADD 4 root heal heal heal root.theres tons we clerics actually do for a group yes we WILL ALWAYS BE NEEDED.nobody can touch us for healing and dont forget about the bonus healing we get that the other classes dont.there i said what i had to say just remember this VI i'm a HEALER not a res toy not a tank nor a nuker<P>be safe<P>Lisaa Goldenheart<BR>Level 55 Cleric<BR>BERTOX<BR>-=DIVINE=-</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Clerics, welcome to the realm of being second-class citizens to druids. We wizzies have been nothing more than taxis for a long time. Now you can be the rez mule that doesn't get called until someone dies, and we can be the taxi that gets you there.

Uhhh...NO!<P>Here is the list of our unique abilities:<P>CotH<BR>Summon (worthless) weapons<BR>Summon coldstones<BR>Summon arrows<P><BR>Now...you've got a choice between a magician and a cleric in your party.  Who do you pick?  THE CLERIC!<P>You've got a choice between a magician and an enchanter in your party.  Who do you pick?  THE ENCHANTER!<P>This could continue ad nauseum, but the point is made.  <P>Clerics...I'll give it to you straight...here goes...<P>I don't want to hear it.<P>Quit your incessant whining (I'd use a different word but it'd get me in trouble...the noun version refers to female canines).<P>Grow up.  <P>You are not the only one playing this game.<P>I am beginnning to wish the whiny clerics were removed from the game.  I assume you're a vocal minority, and that is all that keeps me from calling for the complete removal of clerics from the game.  I am sure most clerics behave like adults and understand why the buff of Druids and Shamans was necessary.  <P>Side point...their buff is not your nerf by the way, so don't even try that.<P>And if you think mages are overpowered, fine, I'll give up some power for more versatility and group friendliness.<P>Contrary to what Absor says, people don't like pets.  They take experience, they have bad pathing, and unlike what some mages say (and I don't know why they say it), the pets don't listen...no matter HOW fast you hit that hotkey!<P>Whiny clerics...shut up, delete your high level clerics, and play a druid or whatever other class you find to be the class du jour...because I'm tired of listening to you.<P>Sub<P>P.S. You guys remind me of some people in a union shop with whom I've had to work.
