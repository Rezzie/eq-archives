</FONT><HR>As for me I enjoyed this thread and must agree with Phelan42 on all points.  This should be a place for people to list the concerns they have for other players's actions, as long as they have been researched, and I believe they have.<P>I do not believe Phelan's multiple listings are a grudge, but just a kind player keeping the other folk up to date.<P>The issue wasn't just 1 or 2 accidental trains.  If you read the complete thread you see the trains happened numerous times on different occasions.  Thus, stating to me that it is a behavior and not an accident.<P>Phelan42,<BR>    Thank You for your input to this board and please continue to do so, as I would prefer to learn from anothers mistake rather than my own.  Please be assured I will stick with this board and list individuals that seem to have, after some research, bad habits. <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Jynxy Paradox of Truth<BR>Dwarven Cleric of the 19th Season<P>Bafa<BR>Dwarven Warrior of the 11th Season</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Thanks Jynxy.  That was the whole point.  I understand trains happen.  I've been unfortunate enough to cause a few of my own.  However, when they take place, I warn the zone line, or take them where they won't hurt anyone.<P>Jihahd's actions in training my groups, was not accidental.  He knew where we were, and he brought multiple mobs on top of us in hopes of dropping a few off.  Nothing accidental about it, and it's nothing like Karnor's.<P>Rinbil's actions in the EC tunnel were also quite different from training scarabs to a zone line where other highlevels are.  The EC tunnel is a congregating point for multiple races and multiple levels.  Slate and Company could have easily killed half a dozen players in there.  If I hadn't known Rinbil and was motivated not to assist him, I still would not have been able to do so due to the faction hits that would be taken.  His faction decisions and bad taste should not detrimentally effect mine.<P>listless:  There is no endless whining taking place.  I am simply warning others of players that will act to harm you in order to save themselves.  This is not a whine about trains, but intentional anti-social behaviour of a few individuals.  Please take a read through the thread one more time, and without the pre-conceived erroneous ideas.  As you haven't bothered to identify your in game character, perhaps you are one of these guys.<P>Or is this the new screen name for Vaalik after he was banned?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well as a 'Dark' race I for one know the disadvantages in sitting at the Ebay commons tunnel..just like a 'light' race would find a possibly unfortunate incident in a 'dark' zone ...and to my knowledge verant hasnt deemed it a safe spot in game, so I take precautions when visiting. As should others. <P>As far as your posts go..thats fine that you warn people of others actions,very nice to know who to watch out for, but some of your postings are unnecessary slander.Do you really feel that high and mighty to be judge others actions other than the facts?<P>example..he just calmly went back to auctioning his yellow Fine Plate. Oddly, in the two hours I was hunting up some items and filling orders for backpacks, he never got a taker, and eventually dropped his price by a bunch.<P><BR>this has NOTHING to do with the trains or any problem..but rather more of your antagonistic remarks. Seems to me if you treat people like this in game(by slandering what they do and how they do it) I for one would want to train you to.<P>Bottom line..I have met Rinbil and YES he seems like an ass..but that is as far as I would tell anyone.. I wouldnt assume his/anyones motives,crticize auctioning tecniques, or anything else other than.." watch out this guy is an ass, he caused an unneccesary train in Ebay Commons".<P><BR>Unbiased<BR>Listless 42 Necro<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm sorry the point of my comment went by you.  The point was that his actions and reputation had gotten around to some.  I wasn't criticizing his "technique" at auctioning (there wasn't anything wrong with how he was doing it), but stating his actions and the reactions of others.<P>I didn't "slander" what Rinbil was doing.  I described his conduct and commented upon it.  As you've stated, he is not a good player.  Unlike your flame of him, I stated why I have come to the conclusion I have.  He has intentionally trained people; KS'd; lied about KSing; and trained high level, faction oriented mobs, to an area where others camped that could have been avoided VERY easily.  For those reasons, I have determined that he is beneath contempt.  In order to assert this point, I have provided my basis.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Just the fact that a person would send that kinda ooc in a zone speaks for itself.  It also goes to show that eventually your reputation will catch up to you.  As big as this game is you will eventually be caught up to no matter what.  Being a druid i can tell you that its not so hard to get around, but its sure nice to have friends in every zone to talk to.  Sure wouldnt want to be in a situation where it was enemies in every zone.

</FONT><HR>Although I agree with alot of what has been said here there has to be some mention of roleplaying.  As a paladin I will eat more trains than I will let go. (the exception to this being Unrest where trains happen every 5 mins.)  Rather than lead a train to a zone that I know will bypass multiple players/groups that cannot handle the trains I will die myself to save the others.  This being said if you are playing an evil character and are roleplaying correctly there is nothing wrong with training into other people/groups occasionaly.  However this could be seen as breaking the play nice rule.  I have a friend that plays a SK in roleplay mode and trains things occasionaly not necessarily on purpose into other groups but he will not try to aviod them.  GM's have called him on this before and as soon as they realize that he is just roleplaying they leave him to go about his buisness.<BR>  So in the cse of Trayler (not having met him) I agree with this column in a way.  I'm not condeming him as a bad player cause in RL there are people that act this way, so why shouldn't there be in EQ also.  I view this column as kinda a Meggan's Law.  If you know about him you can avoid the problem to an extent and if he starts KSing then petition and let the GM's handle it... That's their job.<P>Narvil Lawgiver<BR>Paladin (26)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just wanted to keep everyone informed that Trayler is still up to his ol' lame tricks.  What's kinda funny is that when I /ooc'd not to trust this little jerk after he'd /auc, he sent me a /tell on why I didn't like him.  He then claimed that he'd just bought the character.  (I wish I'd thought to /report that admission.)  But, now we keep hearing stories of subject actions by this twerp, perfectly in character with his prior claims.  Pretty fricking lame.

</FONT><HR>Raist:  Apparently you haven't been paying attention.  People keep giving Traylor a break, and he then screws over some new people.  Did you read Deadlyz' post in the Yilnywen thread?  Traylor promised to pay him 30pp for him to stop what he was doing and port Traylor somewhere.  When they arrived at their destination, Traylor ran off without paying.  This was a fresh person that Traylor had the opportunity to be civil toward, and he chose not to.<P>No one has it in for this guy.  If he truly turned over a new leaf, and got some folks to believe him and accept him, that'd be great for him.  Unfortunately, he keeps choosing to do something other than what is acceptable behaviour.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Shortly after Trayler was shouting in EC about getting scammed by Pidnus. Hhahahaha that made my day. Check out the scammer board listed above on EMarr ezboard for the low down on Pidnus. He is more universally loathed than Trayler I think.

</FONT><HR>Okie first of all. I have met with Pidnus several times and I don't see what all the fuss about him is. I was in mistmoore with him and he was camping the Cloaked Damph and I asked him if i could camp it with him and he said sure. Then it dropped and should have taken it but he let me have it. So i personally like Pidnus alot. I have seen him do some really rude stuff like training but i am sure he doesn't mean it and he is probably a kid like 14 or something. Have some compassion guys. Anyways trayler on the other hand scammed me of my Ceremonial Iksar Bp! What a but face i wanted to kill him. Anyways GM's are looking into me getting it back so that is good. I hope you all forgive Pidnus and Trayler in the long run no one wants enemies. Forgiving and Forgetting is the best strengths that anyone holds.

</FONT><HR>I agree with you Halimak.  Forgive and Forget is a great way to live your life.  Caution, though, is also important.  That's what this is all about.  Folks like Pidnus and Trayler scam people constantly.  The most recent stories are not rehashed ones from a long time ago, but recent actions.  Players need to be warned so that they don't get conned.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
