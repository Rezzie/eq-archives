</FONT><HR>   I have been playing on the nameless since 2 weeks after it came out (Still havent hit 50 tho). Now I used to be friends with a few of the gms, but then most of them left and we got a new bunch (including new head gm). We have had these new ones for quite some time and I probably should have posted on this earliar, but does anybody really know them? Cuse the old gms would sometimes start up a nice conversation when you petitioned them in off hours, never happened with the new ones. Not to mention the lack of friendly communication between gms and players. I remember Hidikea (never able to spell it) used to sometimes make funny Motds. I am making this post to see if anybody can tell me otherwise. Is there anybody out there with a good relationship with the new gms? <P>WINSLO LUMPKINS<BR>37 Gnome Wizard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have made a few petitions, mostly naming violations but occasionally for other issues, and have always found the response to be courteous and fresh (as opposed to a canned response like "thank you for your petition and we will address it" or something), although of course the responses are sometimes long in coming.  In cases where I have replied to responses to petitions, I have been satisfied with the "humanity" of the person on the other end.

</FONT><HR>I had a few encounters with GMs during Hideakis time, which were quite nice and the GMs did their best to help (as their rules aloow them).<BR>But tonight I encountered the other kind of GM, who acts at his friends request in the game, and marks peoples accounts, when they try to explain their side. Conversations like "They KSed me the last half hour and my reporting them went unheard", followed by the GM "YOUR ACCOUNT WAS NOW PERMANENTLY MARKED AND NOW GET OUT OR GET BANNED" tend to disappoint me.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><BR>Especially since they were allowed to KS from me afterwards again... <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><BR>Makes you think, why did your report get no attention at all, and theirs immediately?

</FONT><HR>This makes me wonder is we should petition verant to scrap the nameless's GM Staff. When fighting in OT with my necro i zoned into SF and landed ON TOP of a wurm or somethign when i zoned in. i died (. when back into the zone checked the ent to SF (no body). placed an ooc call for help and a necro saw me pop in and die. The GM said it was my fault for being 40 in a 50+zone and said he wou'd res or summon my body. The necro was VERY Nice and summoned my body for me. i think the only 2 GM's on our server worth keeping are Thistledown and the DE Cleric Chick.

</FONT><HR>Have to say that most of my experiences with the guides on the Nameless have been good ones.  The biggest problem I've found is that there are often none around during non-peak hours.<P>Absolute fave guide, hands down:  Hawthorne.  I remember fondly the evening he took the time to demonstrate for two fat, dumb ogres exactly HOW they could get into Dvinn's tower in Crushbone.  He could've just said, "There's a way; figure it out," but he didn't.  He was gracious and helpful, and his kindness was much appreciated.  Some months later, he made an appearance at the in-game wedding of those same dumb ogres, and brought cake and fireworks for our guests.  I hope we'll have him around for a LONG time to come!   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, this is more geared towards GM's in General than just the ones on TN, but I had to get it off of my chest.<P>It seems to me that their only policy is that there is nothing they can do.  On occation, they might throw you a bone, and help, but that is rare.<P>3 examples.<P>1) dropped a sewing kit with some stuff in it, and couldn't pick it back up (this was before they started the reimbursal policy).  I /petitioned it, and got an answer before it poofed even. No matter what I tried though, I couldn't pick it up.  GM just said that it's not concidered a bug, because it's been like that since Beta, so I don't get my stuff back.  Ok, so we learn from this that if it's been like that forever, it's not a bug.<P>2) In RM, I decided that since I'm a (foolish) necro, and that sphinx over there con's blue, I'll kill it (heh, OOPS).  Ok, so I probably didn't stand a snowballs chance, but it wasn't even a fair fight, since while I was casting once, it feared me, and I couldn't cast at all after that.  No FD, no harmshield, no nothing.  Eventually it caught me, and I died. /petition it, because I couldn't cast, they say that since it's known that it can happen, they won't give a res for it.<P>3) Friend of mine died in Najena because he got bashed, and stuck in a wall, couldn't move, and died. His corpse was still hanging in the wall. /petition it, GM's come and look, say that there is nothing they can do, because they can't prove that it was a bug that he died to.<P>What have we learned from all of this?<BR>If it's a well known bug, you should have known better, so no res for you (I still think I could have taken that sphinx if I could cast the whole time).  If it's not a well known bug, well, they didn't witness it, so it didn't really happen, so no res for you.  <P>Anyone see a pattern here?<P>Danimal Shadowwalker<BR>Northern Pride<BR>46 Necromancer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First off, my handle is Eugee.  Dunno why it won't switch to my chat handle.  *grumble*<P>Second... if Kinathurn (sp?) is a dward, then he's still here, and still an @$$.  I spent my teens fearing crocs to the "fear point" by P2.<P>I spent my 20's fearing sarnaks into the walls of their fortress.<P>I was spending my 30's fearing mobs into the ramp by SF.  I didn't know this was exploiting... hell after 30 levels of fearing it just seemed like the smart way to use the spell.<P>This dwarf pops in, and I say, "Hiya!"  Fear the mob into the ramp while pet and mage partner maul it, nuke once so if fear breaks it rushes me instead of kicking the crap out of my animation.  He /kills the mob, says "You have been officially warned for exploiting, there is a PERMANENT mark on your record!"  (He even used the caps.)<P>I asked him to wait, to explain, what was my exploit, how long was this in effect, why was I never warned before, how was I to know this was an exploit, and after that question he did:<P>Kinathurn smiles at you.<BR>Kinathurn waves at you.<P>Then he was gone.  Just an added "I heard you, I'm ignoring you."  Bit on the end there.<P>I sent three tells to him, to no avail, and stopped for fear of being accused of harrassment.<P>So I /petitioned again.  The next guide who showed up explained to me:<P>1.  Forcing a mob to run into an object was an exploit, but a mob "fleeing" into one on it's own isn't.  She understood that I just thought how fear was good; if you couldn't slow it, then you ran the risk of it missing the object you're aiming for.<P>2.  The reason the say nothing about Oasis is because if you fear it within about 2 dunes of P2, it's running to that spot, even from Orc Highway.  Players can't control it.  However, moving over 20 paces would allow my mob to clear the ramp.  (We laughed and showed her we could kill it faster without fearing them, it just allowed us to jabber more in /guild during the fight.)<P>3.  She explained that the "mark" was nothing sinister.  Just a record that I had been warned, and could not claim I didn't know any better.<P>4.  Got the email address for me to file a complaint regarding Kinathur's actions.  (By the way, about 10 seconds after my /petition got anwered, Kin was sending me all kinds of tells and being EXTREMELY polite with me.  I responded, "I'm sorry, I'm no longer calm enough after your actions to speak with you in a respectable manner.  I'll deal with a fresh GM please."<P>Now here's why I'm a boob.

</FONT><HR>I must say most of my dealing with the GM's has not beeen satisfactory at all.  I recently had my surname removed from my lvl 34 character. Now I was very upset that it was taken.  It was not offensive or vulgar but I was told that it violates the policy because there were nothing nucular in the time setting.  The character is a wizard and her surname was Nukkesem. OK now I think I was more upset by the way it was handled as opposed to it being taken.  I was in no way shape or form informed it was going to be taken.  When i questioned the policy on how names where removed I was told that the player receives a tell in game. Well that is a big LIE. Second when I sent a petiton the guide didnt really know so he passed it on.  The GM that finally sent tell would not give me a reason it was removed just kept asking me what i wanted to change it too.  <BR>Am I wrong in thinking the GM's are not only there to regulate things but to be of assistance to the players?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>My experiences with GMs, Guides, as well as the Admin staff including GS have been mostly negative, very few willing to help the players. The Verant staff seems intent on harrassing players, as well as stifling player creativity. An example of this is their naming policy, which they are constantly adding new UNWRITTEN rules to. I will advise no one to ever purchase a Verant product again. IF ITS POLICY THEN PUT IT IN WRITING! </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>According to these goofs, CHONGQING CHINA is not an appropriate name. Nor is Ohmuhgawd as it could be phonetically interpreted as a phrase. Same with Dusk T'Dawn. YET NONE OF THIS IS IN THEIR POLICY. IF THESE TWERPS ARE GOING TO HAVE POLICY, PUT IT IN WRITING. As is they are free to bend the rules and do whatever the heck they want. Majority of their time is indeed spent harrassing players. Yes, I am angry, and will be for a long long time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ahh some very good stories here for sure.  All in all my encounters with the GM's of the nameless are far and few between.  I've been playing the nameless for as long as it's been around I hopped on the first few days it was opened.  All my answers have been quick and to the point except for the last one.  Now i'm going to scew this guides name up but I think it was Guddlar or something like that he is a Troll lvl 50 and i think a shaman.  Anyway I was having some probs in the Dalnir caves there is a bug that when you fear one of those monkies (grin) they sometimes fall beneath the world.  Well when they do that they can attack you but you cant do anything about them.  After my death I petitioned.  Who pops up the funnies guide I have ever come across although there was nothing he could do for me I looted my body already.  He was cracking jokes and clowning around.  Was very funny stuff.  Keep up the good work Mr troll.  One person can make a difference.  Best of luck all.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Unfortunately all I everhad was bad service whenever I heve dealt with the GM's on Nameless I had my name taken never received any notice just poof gone. Another instance I was dumped off of the barger from timorous to overthere 2 times because of pathing they told me to try again same thing happend they say oh I will have to refer this to a senior GM finally a senior gm comes and it happens again he ask what i want him to do about it guess what I got I got a tp to Overthere right in the city where the boat docks what a good place for a mage  of good attribute. for the few times I have contacted a gm for assistance the game would probably be a happier place without them to muck up my attitude about the game. Verant free us from the waste of time you call Game masters maybe call em Power misers who think they are to good to help. because of a bug I waste almost 2hours of game time and I get dumped in a dangerous spot thanks for nothing GMS</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum39&number=39&thisthread=000021&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum39&number=39&thisthread=000021&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
