</FONT><HR>/shrug. if anything i would want is the 3 disciplines to allow us to be more useful in the uber raids. Riposte, Mighty Stroke and Defensive.<BR>Verant can call it some other name as long as they do the same thing as it does for a warrior. It can be a higher refresh time and smaller duration, np.<P>I dont care about more AC, more hitpoints,higher skills or the even more spells. Spells suck for hybrids.<P>I do want them to change the way XP is allocated when a hybrid is grouped tho. Lumping me with a 68 % xp penalty is fine to me, its BULL**** to share it amongst the group post 50 because anyone would know that its not justified past lvl 50.<P>Talking to warriors in my guild and watching the in action shows me that verant bent over backwards and open wide to shut the legion of whiners up. Hell the rogues deserved whatever they got becasue of the shafting they received but the warriors have been given the cake, the bread and the buttter all at the same time. Either way, you have made the hybrid tanks even less useful post 50 in respect to the mobs and the uber mobs. <P>You wanted class diversity verant but have you wondered why the number of warriors outnumber the hybrids combined on the newest and latest servers? Players are not gonna struggle to level up and just be happy to be "flavor".<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I find it remarkable that so few people are playing the classes of most historical interest in the fantasy genre.<P>I notice more than a few people are of the 'it won't happen' and 'its too hard to do' faction.  Or the "it isn't vision(tm)."<P>Um hello?  What are you guys, sheep?<P>I GMd RPGs for 12 years.  Like VI my philosophy was "you are in my world now"<P>But I put it to you all that the following points are so self evident even a spotty teenager opening up TSR AD&D could work it through:<P>- combat classes should not have weapon restrictions unless they are religious.  IE any melee class can dual wield, use blunt, halberds, their little finger.  <BR>- some classes will be better than others at executing those skills (monks unarmed, rangers on bow, rogues on assasin weaps etc) - and that skill ability is on a per level basis, not a skill cap basis (SKs have 75 for bow, uhuh...)<BR>- if the game must have 'levels' it should be fair.  If a class has inate powers that give it substantial advantages - xp penalty.<BR>(=&gt; necros, enchanters, and clerics not hybrids...)<BR>- if there is an xp penalty apply it to the right people, not everyone else.<BR>- if you can cast spells, either the mana costs more, the xp costs more, or you cast considerably weaker level spells - but to apply the whole lot as well as a limited selection??<BR>- if you force people to have to group then ensure everyone has something to offer, not make them bad substitutes<BR>- does anyone else find it remarkable that the only way to kill dragons in this game is to have huge raid teams? What happened to the ideal of a small party of hardy (albeit stupid) adventurers?<BR>- how do you rationalise pet classes who have pets who are nastier than the melee classes?<BR>- how do you rationalise that the mobs heal, recast, self buff, at rates no PC can match?<BR>- how do you rationalise that the only characters in the game able to cast bind on a player is another player and not an NPC?<BR>- pet foible, how do you rationalise that one of the SKs nastiest weapons of choice is a small blunt thing?<BR>- hell, how do you rationalise a real time game where the way to get xp is to set up camp, and proceed to steadliy slaughter 100+ mobs over four hours, not complete an epic adventure?<BR>- the rot for hybrid problems starts at 40, not 50 - its here that they skill cap out in key skills; weaps, taunt, dodge, offense, defense<P>Upshot: VI can take a bow for having developed the best RPG game ever, at least in the online sense - but the ride will come to a pretty sudden halt unless they are prepared to have a pretty solid stab at re establishing the basics.  <P>Heres hoping that if they really can't deliver on the stuff above (hey, its their funeral, we'll all just find another game) they do make an EQ2 which actually offers xp for activity, not just mindless killing.<P>I love the game - but the hybrid situation, ergh.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Excellent post Incommunicado.<P>But will Verant listen? Nope. Will they even bother to take notice? Nope. It is really annoying because every single point you make there seems so obvious yet Verant missed it.<P>As for hybrids, I wanted to begin a new character based solely around grouping (I've soloed to much during my EQ career). I liked the idea of an SK but now I think I'll just make a warrior instead. At least I can be confident knowing that my class does its job well and will be welcome everywhere I go (subject to increasing population numbers  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">).<P>Verant I hope you learn for EQ2.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Agree with all the SunMoon said.  BUT, once again, I doubt Verant will listen.  Its a "dead" issue as far as they are concerned.   Hybrids are now few in number and dropping.   They have the numbers played on each server, so they know the problem.  They don't want to commit the resourses to fix the problem let alone admit there is a problem.  Things are "working as intended" which means they don't want many hybrids in the game.  I commend you on your continued efforts to get a change and I really hope you well.  If there is a change then I will bring my 51 ranger out of retirement.  Good luck.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Outstanding post. Not sure though why you dont find anything for bards though. What bards need are their songs tweaked. But what I will concentrate on is the XP penalty. While I will agree that prior to lvl 50 and Kunark hybrids did have some advantages they are now gone. The new armor and abilities that pure classes have received have far surpassed the advantage that hybrids once enjoyed and made them so attractive. I still love playing my bard but would like to see the xp penalty removed being that haste has been nerfed and that enchanter spells now completely compensate for anything a bard can do other than the mana song.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Re: removing the experience penalty, why do you keep asking for something that is never going to happen?<P>Re: removing the mana penalty, would be nice.<P>Re: allow us to cast spells while fighting, doesn't make any sense from a roleplay perspective, let alone a gameplay balance one.<P>Re: introduce new equipment to maximize our spell casting abilities, Verant is probably working on this in Velious.<P>Re: allow us to pick any spells we want per spell level, ROFL, not going to happen.<P>Re: give us all spells from our parent class but three spell ranks below, not going to happen, not even sure how this would help.<P>RANGERS<P>Re: make archery viable, how?  I would be happy if they just _fixed_ it to work the way it worked before.  I read Verant was going to add procs to bows.  Maybe this will help.<P>Re: give us self teleports, not sure why Verant even gave druids teleport spells, originally only wizards had them, I believe.<P>Re: enhance tracking, sounds like it's in the works.<P>Re: Jolt to 49, would love to see this but not going to happen.<P>Re: Ranger only ability, dual wield and double attack as a hybrid lets a ranger do some serious damage.<P>Re: lupine discipline, Verant's toying with the idea of disciplines for hybrids, aren't they?  Anyway, disciplines were given to pure melees because of the lack of something to look forward to after 50.<P>SHADOW KNIGHT<P>Re: harm touch doing some real damage, would be nice to see this scaled up a bit post-50, since monster HPs are scaled up post-50 as well.<P>Re: vampiric embrace, nice to see something like this in their class-defining weapon, perhaps?  Has anyone gotten the shadow knight epic weapon yet?<P>Re: shorter duration DoTs, DoTs have already had their durations decreased before to make them more useful, remember?<P>Re: discipline, see lupine discipline above.<P>PALADIN<P>Re: enhance lay of hands, group lay of hands, hmm... a wee bit overpowering, don't you think?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Re: more holy weapons, hear hear!<P>Re: discipline, see lupine discipline above.<P>...<P>Instead of just asking for a bunch of things that will never happen, why don't we try to focus on the issues making hybrids so unpopular and underpowered post-50 and ask for fixes for those issues instead?  Let's also try to ask for things that might actually happen too, at least in this iteration of EverQuest, not the next one?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Sunmoon,<P>TOO MUCH.<BR>Honestly, we don't need massive revisions in spells, huge increases in skills, mega-uber weapons, or a plethora of disciplines.<P>This is what I propose.  I feel it avoids the whol skill cap debate, lets hybrids be hybrids (but DESIRED hybrids), and maintains 'balance'.<P><BR>RoK screwed everything up.<BR>Pal/SK/Ran WERE tanks. And were supposed to be nearly as capable at tanking. War were a bit better. The others could effectively tank better if you included spells, but that involved more work (managing spells/mana, etc). This makes sense. War effectiveness was easy. Auto-attack, kick, taunt. Hybrids took more work to get the same out of them, but you could if they were played right.<P>Not anymore. A ranger at 60 MAY (and I mean MAY, i do not think so given typical equipment) be able to outdamage a lv 60 warrior. But that would be at full mana-burn. And with their crappy RoK armor and skills they would be dead.<P>Paladin buffs become COMPLETELY WORTHLESS in a group when the cleric gets the group buffs. Heals/stuns all require that melee be suspended. So no damage is being done to the mob.<P>SKs are in the best position spell-wise (many fewer necros in a group than clerics or druids)post 50. But some imporvements are indeed feasible, esp unnerfing of certain spells.<P>Bards ARE NOT hybrids. They are highly desirable, and HOPEFULLY are having some song issues addressed. I have never played one and do not pretend to understand their problems.<P><BR>Proposed Solutions:<P>Rangers - still need 10 pts of def (shouldn't be outdamaged and OUTTANKED by rogues), should be able to melee while casting. Since most spells are offensive or scouting, I am not aware of *major* problems here. One off, one def, and one raid discipline (slighly watered down from war ones)<P>Paladin - one HP, one AC, and one HP/AC buff that are relatively weak (say 250hp, 12AC, 125hp/8AC) but that stack with the existing cleric buffs. Should be able to melee while casting. One off, one def, and one raid discipline (slighly watered down from war ones).<P><BR>SKs - unnerfing of some spells (VE, etc.) Should be able to melee while casting. One off, one def, and one raid discipline (slighly watered down from war ones)<P>TAUNT - caps remain same, but enabled to work against all non-God/Dragon/Etc. mobs.<P><BR>There IS a problem when a second warrior is preferred over any hybrid for a group. That IS the situation post 50 against 50- mobs.<P>The pal buffs make that first war an EVEN better tank. Rangers can *actually* outdamage a war if casting heavily, but won't be dead before the cleric can heal him. But will NEVER be tanking in the place of a warrior.<P>SKs will feel some of their evil power come to fruition.<P>BTW Discipline Ideas (don't want ot create more cheesy exploits a.k.a VS, so they will be straightforward).<P>1. Ranger<BR>Raid - Riposte as war, but with 80% duration plus uses up all mana that 75 wis ranger has at 55th level (plus the reuse delay, same as when war gets it, but doesn't decrease as they level)<BR>Def - 100% dodge activation (as rogue nimble) but with 80% duration, mana and reuse per above example (uses rogue base reuse time, etc.)<BR>Off - 100% successful attacking, but 80% duration, mana, and reuse per previous examples, <P>MAY NOT CAST SPELLS untill disc wears off.<BR>(applies to all of these examples)<P>2. Paladin<BR>Raid - uses Parry instead of riposte, duration 150% of riposte discipline (or above ranger risposte one, whichever would be less troubling to warriors), mana, resuse as above.<BR>Def - as warrior defensive discipline, 80% durarion, etc...<BR>Off - 100% attack success, as above examples...<P>3. SKs as Pals <P><BR>Look what is done here:<P>(This makes a hybrid viable for an XP camp or even raid.)<P>1 Warriors STILL preferred as primary tank because TAUNT is FIXED, they retain unparalled damage tables, HP, AC, and skill caps vs. Hybrids.<BR>2. No inc in hybrid HP or armor.<BR>3. Skill inc ONLY for ranger defense (god bless them)<BR>4. Buff increase only for Pal, but stacks and will make Wars all the better when grouped.<BR>5. Prevents 'negative damage/healing' of hybrid spells due to current 'attack-suspspension' during casting.<BR>6. Hybrids DO NOT gain critical strikes, MR, triple attack, etc. of warrior.<BR>7. Hybrids get disciplines (yes, the traits of the better ones, I admit), but do so at reduced effectiveness due to shorter duration, inherent War starting values (during riposte war will hit more often due to higher skill), mana costs, no reductuion in reuse time, and inability to cast during the discipline<P><BR>So, what are everyone's thought.<P>Thaumiel<BR>E'ci<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>In response to the "necro's just send in their pet and watch it get rocked by AEs". That is completely absurd. You can channel your freakin mana to the cleric for chripes sake. Essentially you become a tank that can outdamage nearly every melee in EQ *and* half a cleric to boot, and you are *useless* to a raid?!?!!? not to mention that when the raid goes bad you are at the zone to start summoning corpses... I'm beginning to think hybrids will NEVER get fixed, and it has NOTHING to do with VI not wanting to fix them; it has to do with the fallout that will occur when hybrids are just as desired for grouping as any other class.<P>1. Raise skill caps, especially on rangers defense for crying out loud. You already balance the classes by AC on the armor; why do you have to rebalance it by exp penalty, AC on class specific armor *and* skill caps?? Again we hybrids get over-penalized.<P>2. And this is regarding a slighlty different issue, but it plays a roll in here. Make 2hd weapons BETTER. Everyone knows 2hd weapons are junk compared to 1hd. My ebon mace outdamages my granite face grinder for crying out loud and I get to use an insane uber shield with it, too!!<P>3. remove the additional mana costs on hybrids spells. Again we see TOO much penalization here.<P>4. 3 disciplines for each hybrid(1 offensive, 1 defensive, and one unique to each class. and how about some originality in them as well(ie one unique to each class that is VERY in character? here is one: "death touch". After using this discipline(1.5 hour recycle time)this SKs next harm touch will do triple damage and cannot be reisisted. OMG SKS on a Venril run??? Would we be wanted for trak maybe then??? *shrug* <P>5. Either 1. Remove the spells on the warrior/rogue armor 2. give hybrids spells on their armor that are more versatile and just plain better or 3. make the current spells on the hybrid armor NOT have the triple casting time on all their pieces(I realize the paladin helm and possibly some others would need to be adjusted to keep it balanced). <P>6. Fix harm touch. I will not get into it right now. VI knows it is weak, this should have been fixed long ago.<P>7. STOP being hypocrites. Why is it a VI official stated that an unresistable harm touch would be too powerful when with disciplines you can THREE times the damage of a harm touch AND have it recycle faster??? I thought this was TOO powerful??!! or did you mean it was too powerful for a hybrid?!? "Unerfing vampiric embrace would make SK's too powerful" And then they have a relatively common drop in HS that is significantly better than the VE procs and an insane ratio on the weapon to boot.. but rogues and warriors can use it... it must not be too powerful if we let rogues and warriors use it... *sigh*<P>8. Better spell selection. Why not let rangers get the first set of self only ring spells?? Why not let SKs get a decent group friendly DoT ie the poison line. Why don't SKs get some of the group friendly necro spells(screaming terror, summon corpse, subversions, DMF etc..)? <P>I find it very interesting that all the GMs I see on test now are either rogues or warriors... *hint* *hint* I would really hope VI is above showing favoritism in their game mechanics, but since hybrid issues have existed for soo long and never get addressed while rogues and warriors get bonus after bonus, it really makes me wonder.<BR> <BR>I recently had my friend beg me *not* to play my SK because he wanted to level that night. I sure feel good about my SK after that... 57 levels I have into my SK verant, and he is essentially useless and ungroupfriendly. Please fix hybrids, everyone knows they are broken.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>For all hybrids, allowing to attack while casting would possibly justify the xp penalty since it would be actual flexibility.  As it stands, if I'm tanking I might waste upwards of 10 seconds to get off a DOT in combat counting interrupts.  During those 10 seconds if I had not cast at all, I would likely dish out about 300 damage - nearly the damage of my best DOT.<P>Hybrids should get 1-2 disciplines that are different for each hybrid class, or perhaps one warrior discipline and one class specific discipline.<P>While I can't argue about rangers, Harm Touch is not very viable on raid encounters.  The damage is in line with a single wizard nuke, but many mobs are fully immune.  I suggest changing Harm Touch to use the Lure resistance table, and adding an additional 20 points of damage per level from 51 to 60.  This would make a level 50 HT do 601, level 51 do 641, and level 60 do 1001.  The argument that 32 60th level shadowknights would band together to instantly kill a mob is sophomoric.  You would need to get every 60th level SK from every server together to do that, and all the while a warrior with a damage discipline can rack up 4-5k damage in a matter of seconds.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>it is sad sad sad that a topic such as this, which addresses all hybrids and not just rangers or paladins or shadow knights, gets no word from Verant. i love EQ. i love my ranger. i wanted nothing other than to be a ranger, and i am sure that paladins and shadowknights feel the same. but while our classes do not really suck, they are severely punished by multiple deficiencies that were brought on by kunark, and this is primarily for two reasons:<P>1) pure melee got disciplines<BR>2) pure melee skill caps were raised very high<P>hybrids have been forgotten by Verant. they just dont seem to understand in-game dynamics at all. i wish just once i could group someone from verant to even see if they know how to play a class.<P>i am not going to add to what needs to be changed. it has been said so many times over the past, what, 8 months? and when we get a response, it is normaly something really insulting like "this has been addressed in the FAQ", or "play a different class", or "nothing is wrong with rangers/paladins/shadowknights". the worst class right now in the 50+ kunark game is the ranger, and it seems that verant wants it this way. i dont think the give two s.h.i.t.s and this is evidenced by their lack of customer representation and their neglect of these issues on these boards.<P>no hybrid (that is sane and is mature) wants to be the most powerful class in the game. we dont want to be necros. we dont want to be warriors or rogues, etc. we just want to have a VIABLE and SPECIAL class that can contribute to a group dynamic positively and not be denied group access because we can hardly contribute as much as pure melee can.<P>please take off your role-play glasses, verant. try looking at the 50+ game from the perspective of group efficiency and how the game is played on kunark with high level players. and if you dont know what this means (and you seem not to), please send your testers out to real live servers AS HYBRIDS and test it out in game with real live day to day players.<P>why do you resist this? why can't you even say anything? why not just come out and say "we dont want hybrids to be good classes. we want you to be very inferior to pure melee".</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>/em totally agrees.<P>Sadly none of this will happen.  I will be amazed if this thread even gets a response.  If I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times.... Verant does not care about any of this.  Verant Interactive ONLY cares about getting your $9.95 (or even 49.95) a month and maintaining one guy's twisted vision.<P>Honestly, do you really think a company that thinks that 90 mins of boat travel to get someplace is fun cares about any of this?  Do you really think that a company that thinks looking for an exp res at 4 am is all part of the fun is going to care about any of this?  Do you really think that a company that nerfs EVERYTHING at some point cares about any of this?  Do you really think that a company that instead of beefing up customer support to deal with in-game disputes adopts the so-called "play nice policy" which basicly takes the stance of an abusive parent ("If I have to come deal with this you'll ALL have something to cry about") really cares about any of this?  Do you really think that a company that has 300K subscribers worldwide but somehow can't find a way to offer a toll-free number for tech support cares about any of this?  Do you really think that a company that took pre-orders for the first expansion and illegally charged hundreds of credit cards before shipping the product cares about any of this?<P>The only way this thread will even get a response is if somewhere in the 300 posts, some jerk (there is always that one) posts the ONE message that we are all wrong, hybrids are balanced, we knew what we were getting into, Verant is right on, etc. etc. yadda yadda yadda. Then and ONLY THEN will someone from Verant respond, flying right past the original 300 posts and agreeing with the one jackass who thinks we are wrong.  They will go on to say we must agree to disagree....this is a dead issue....#%&*@ you....have a nice day....keep sending money.<P>Oh, and to the guy who posted that he actually agrees with the exp penalty because he knew what he was getting into when he started his ranger, well hoody-hoody-hoo, Mr. Insight!  I started a paladin TWO weeks after the game released, as did my best friend, and our other friend started a ranger.  NONE of us knew what we were getting into then and being blind-sided by a BS exp penalty like that is just WRONG.  I stopped playing my pally ages ago, but my friend's main character is still his first love -- his 49 pally and AFTER NEARLY TWO YEARS of blood sweat and tears he can hardly play any more because of the disadvantages he has as a hybrid.  It just kills him to even try.  All this because we were stupid enough to trust Verant and their description of the classes.<P>And while I'm on a rant about the early days of the game, remember how the orginal OFFICIAL strategy guide said that Humans recieved an exp bonus?  We know now that thats not the case.  A few months ago I saw a thread where a guy accused Verant of lying about something and Abashi completely flew off the handle and threatened to ban him (VI's fine CS at work....don't like an opinion, heck just ban the opiner) saying that Verant doesn't lie about anything.  Well when the OFFICIAL guide says humans get an exp bonus and they don't, what do you call that Abashi?  When YOU say that epic quests work and they don't, what do you call that?  When you charge people's credit cards for a product before it's shipped what do you call that?<P>Sorry to go off, but after nearly 2 years of playing this game, I've about had it.  Ever see the bumper sticker, "Love my country, hate my Government"?  Thats how I feel about this game.  The game has SO much potential, there are so many great people playing it and could be WONDERFUL.  Problem is the company that makes it and their inability to deal with their customers and their customers' issues.  Take a poll....ask how many people love EQ. Then ask how many people HATE Verant.<P>The most disconcerting thing is that not only are they doing what they are doing to EQ, but they've now been handed the beloved Star Wars to screw up.  God help us.<P>Al</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>First of all I'd like to say excellent post Sunmoon.<P>The thing I think that is at the heart of the issue is the exp penalty. Why do we pay it and why must the people we group for pay it? It has often been said that we are 3/4 warriors and 1/4 casters (or as has been joked about 1/2 warriors 1/4 casters  =)  ). I don't know about you, but all the math I've ever been taught says 3/4 + 1/4 =1. How is it then that Verant justifies an exp penalty? If we WERE equal to the rest of the classes in the game why should we get penalized? And the fact that we aren't at higher levels just throws the whole thing even more out of whack.<P>Also, in regards to the exp penalty, I think that what a lot of people are saying about how we should get disciplines, but the should be "watered down" from the warrior ones. In my opinion this is soooo wrong. It all goes back to the exp penalty. Should we, and all the people we group with, pay a penalty so that we can be "watered down" warriors with a couple of spells? <P>I would ask ALL of the people over at Verant to sit down and think long and hard. I would honestly like them to do this. Think long and hard about WHY we have an exp penalty. IF all the classes were balanced why would there be a need for an exp penalty? And if all the classes were balanced why do most hybrids think that they are getting charity when their friends invite them on a raid, because they feel they contribute nothing real to the raid. Again I would ask Verant to think long and hard about this issue. Sit down and look at a level 60 Pally/SK/Ranger and a level 60 Warrior and see if they are equal. If they aren't there are serious problems because we, as hybrids pay an exp penalty. If they are equal still there is a problem, because again we a pay an exp penalty.<P>In the end I would ask Verant for the final time to take the time to really think about this. Yes this would mean a major revamping to the way things work now. But look at the situation and tell me honestly that the situation as it stands is not grossly unfair. As I can see it, in the need for class balance, there are only two solutions.<P>1) Give hybrids a reason to be let into a group and on large raids. Allow hybrids to contribute. Make us powerful enough so that those of us who have gotten to high levels feel there is a reason that when we click /played we are shocked at the amount of time we have taken out of our lives to play EQ to reach this point.<P>2)If you are afraid that people are ignorant and will just whine and say he/she is more powerful than me and not look at the price payed for that power, which is a valid concern, then please get rid of the exp penalty. Yes it will take a lot of work. That is true, but at this point isn't it only fair to do away with it?<P>Lastly in the event that somehow, in someway Verant manages, as thinking, comprehending human beings, to justify the exp penalty and not improve hybrids, do away with the penalty to our groupmates. There is no reason what so ever that they should suffer for our decision. I thank everyone for taking their time to read this.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Some very nice suggestions there, especially from a few people who actually thought before posting.<P>Hybrids just aren't wanted post 50, simple fact, just check the entrance requirements for "uber-guilds" if you want proof. If it wasnt for the friends we've made in our pre 50 days and in our guilds we'd never get groups, except on the first thursday of the month and all the warriors were on holiday. We aren't needed for uber raids, we're there just because we're friends with people who are there and this isn't how it should be. We should be wanted for something we bring to the group. <P>If our oh so useful spells allowed us to solo, they dont or we had at least some limited benefit to a group we wouldnt have to moan. But hybrids HAVE to group to progress, we CANT solo effectively PLUS we dont bring anything special to the group. In other words we get the worst of both worlds.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Some very good ideas here, but we need to remember to keep our suggestions simple. We all know that Verant is not going to implement a slew of new enhancements at once no matter how underpowered a class is.<P>The biggest problem is that we hybrids have the experience penalty. We have a class experience multiplier of 14, wheras most other classes have one of 9 to 12, with most classes at 10 or 11. This is simply incredible! There is no way in the world that having a hybrid in the group improves the groups efficency enough to make up for the additional amount of experience they take, even if we could use our very weak spell casting abilities to our fullest in battle (how many hybrids do you see medding with the casters in a constant pull group).<P>It's as simple as that.<P>Now there are two ways to bring hybrid classes back to par with the other classes:<P>1) Remove the experience penalty. <BR>I sort of doubt this is feasable for a few reasons one of which is technical. Your level is determined by a lump sum of experience, to change the experience penalty would probably require some serious time in going to each character struct(data file essentially) and dividing total experience by 75% or whatever, then changing level markers (points at which new levels are reached). Anyway, this would be the ideal, although most difficult, method.<P>2) If removing exp is not possible, then a Hybrid's value to a group should be equal to the amount of experience they take, therefore: Paladins and Shadow Knights should have 100% of the defensive abilities and 60 - 75% of the offensive abilities of Warriors.  Rangers should have 100% of the offenses and 60 - 75% the defenses of Warriors, plain and simple. <P>If this were the case, now groups would not mind having a hybrid, who could fill their role as either a tank or a damage dealer, to it's full extent, in addition cast a few spells from time to time. This removes the problem of groups having to settle for a Paladin/SK who can not tank a well as a warrior, or hit NEARLY as well as one (vice versa for a ranger), while taking a large chunk of unearned experience.<P>Our casting abilities stink, and will always have to stink. I would not even mind seeing Verant nerf our mana pool back to it's original state, as this has no affect on effiency in the slightest, just gives us a bigger store.<P>Let me know what you all think.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Oh one other thing....<P>Sorry, I was too busy ranting that I forgot to add a thanks to SunMoon.  You should be commended for continuing to maintain your composure (where I and many others are reduced to ranting  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">) and constantly throwing this bs back in the face of the evil Verant in a reasonable manner.  You have been a leader in the Ranger community, and by extension, a champion of hybrid issues for quite some time.  I play a SK these days and my best friend is a Pally.  I thank you, sir.<P>For the record, I would love to see any and all of  your recommendations find their way into the game, but I would be happy with just having the exp penalty removed.  As someone posted, the self-exp penalty is lame, but the group penalty is just too dang severe.  It bad enough WE take a penalty, its just downright comedic that others suffer from grouping with us.<P>As I saw in a post some time ago, why would someone want 75% of a warrior and 25% (I think it's less than that though because with very few exceptions our spells at the levels we get them are a joke) of a necro/cleric/ranger in a group only to have them reduce everyone's exp by 40%?  They wouldn't.....thus this entire discussion.<P>Al</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>This is obviously not a response to your proposed changes.  I don't have an answer for them, and I won't for a while.  We're not going to be able to look at an issue like this real soon, what with all the Velious excitement and such.  However, I have read the thread and noted the ideas.  Please understand that what might seem like the right thing to do, or like an easy change, might not be so right, nor so easy.<P>But keep discussing these ideas.  I'll keep reading.<P>  Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ok, on the first post, not caring about spells? well why play a hybrid if you dont care about spells? well anyway. About the disiplins, it makes sence for hybrids or at least pallys and shad's to get them because they are the most warrior like (plate armor etc), at 50+ its like us hybrids dis-own our warrior side in advancement and just go on spells. Its like giving up half of what makes us, us. We (the hybrids) should get disicplins etc spaced and givien out kist like the warrior abilities where in 50- like bash parry bla bla.<P>Xadion Darkborn <BR>42 shadowknight of Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
