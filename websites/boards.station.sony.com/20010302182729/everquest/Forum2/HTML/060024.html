&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Ok, let's start this off right by admiting that I am VERY bitter over this latest patch. Not only will clerics find casting that mother of all heal spells, Complete Heal, much more problematic (due directly to the reworked hate-list), but now Verant, in its collective and infinite wisdom, has decided that druids (you know, those funny tree-huggers who can gleefully SoW themselves, snare, quad-kite, and then kill mobs with their mana-free Lum staves and it's AoE DD - not to mention SoW others and port anyone anywhere and evac them if things get too out of control) were not Uber enough. To rectify this glaring bit of shortsightedness, it has been decided that the poor, downtrodden druid class ALSO needs more and better healing powers, to close the gap between the druids and the clerics. Yes, that's right folks; unless you are taking down a "boss mob" (dragon, god, VS, etc), if your group of 6 can refrain from taking any deaths, a druid will serve you just was well in the healing department - AND that same druid can also SoW, port and Evac you. Couple a druid with a shaman, and groups can avoid deaths - and clerics - quite readily; no need to group the dead weight of a cleric along on your trip to Old Sebilis, thank you very much.<P>Excuse ME, Verant?! I have played my first EQ character through 55 levels of clerical servitude, only to NOW find that you have made it simplicity itself for people to avoid the need of a cleric unless they find themselves in need of an occasional res? I really don't understand this; clerics can not solo worth a lick. Clerics HAVE to group in order to progress and earn experience - and now you have not only made it vastly easier for groups to pass up a cleric in favor of a druid, but you have done so by strengthening the one class that is arguably the BEST equipped for soloing - the druid class itself. What's next - druid-pets with the strength of necro-pets? Allowing druids to call upon the forces of Nature to Revive those who have fallen in combat in outdoor settings? How about allowing the poor druid class to wear plate mail - Tunare knows they need it, those unfortunate wretches...<P>How about throwing the cleric class a bone every once in a while? I don't mean something like that twisted attempt at humor that was the cleric "pet" spell (a summoned hammer with 100 hit points that disappears either after the mob is dead or it has been hit twice? Yah, THAT is real usefull...); how about something like a self-only invis spell for the clerics? If a WIZARD can get an Invis to Undead at 39, I certainly can not see why a cleric couldn't get a self-invis at the same level. Increase the healing powers of the Shaman class? Great - how about giving the humble cleric at level 53 a pet that can have more than 100 hit points and doesn't de-pop when the fight with one mob is over? <P>I think granting the other classes greater powers of healing was extremely short-sighted and detrimental to the cleric class as a whole. Had I never played and leveled a cleric before this patch, I certainly would not feel compelled to start one now. Druids are the de facto supreme class in all of Norrath. Thanks for nothing, Verant; I am beginning to suspect that The Vision(tm) is being influenced by a few too many pulls on the pipe. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>AMEN !!!<P>You know, I have always stuck up for Verant's inteligance and know-how but now I'm at a total loss.<P>When I logged onto the game today I got several tells from friends asking me what I was going to do with my char. <P>I didnt know what to say because I never thought Verant would make such a stupid move.<P>You know, Verant will NOT fix this issue for us because if they did they would be admiting they were wrong and as you and I both know there are ALOT of druids out there level 50 plus that would get upset. <P>Now ask yourself this question, How many of those 50 plus druids know how to group ? Not many I'll tell you because they have soloed almost all of thier levels and now Verant gives them the "Main Healer" postition.<P>Also I looked for Abashi's email address and I can not find it.<P>The only email addresses I have are:<P>[EDITED]<P>I would just like to be able to speak to Abashi or someone that made up this patch to find out the reasoning of it, why was it so important to nerf Clerics?<P>Im sure this post will get flamed by the druids just like all the other cleric posts but you know something, I've never been flamed by a Druid in game when they just lost level 54 and needed an Exp Rez to get it back. Funny eh ??<P>Then you'll get Druids posting that they TP us all over the place, haha .. Cmon people, I could get a Druid from level 1 to 39 in less than a week and do the porting myself.<P>Just my 2 coppers like it or not   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>Hextorn<BR>55th Templar of Xegony<P><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]

</FONT><HR>There is one point in your post that strikes me as wrong.<P>"So a group can just pick up a shaman and druid and avoid clerics altogether."<P>And your gripe is? Excuse me, but what other class in the game can replace more than two classes? You are asking for Verant to make it impossible to do Sebilis or a normal 6-person group without a cleric? That's completely and utterly illogical.  No class in the game should be 100% required, period.<P>You deserve this because you can't solo? When's the last time soloing granted more exp than a good group? Or perhaps you've never seen clerics solo lower guk.  Either way, soloing is not a scapegoat, because it is merely a feature for certain classes, not even considered a "viable form of advancement" by Verant past 50.  And we are talking about post 50, if you haven't noticed already, not pre-50 when druids could have soloed, but post-50 where the game changes and druids/shamans seldom solo anymore.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The line has been getting blurred for sometime pretty soon it will be hard to disntiguish one class from another as so many class specific abilities have been doled out to other classes.<P>If they want to make druids more of a healing class then they should take away their WIZARD-like DD's or TELEPORT powers - either that or give them to Clerics to be fair."<P>Cant believe your still arguing this point as the basis for a COMPLETE game change post 50...

</FONT><HR>Agreed, very bitter is well put. I have worked long and hard to build a good cleric now at lvl 45 I find myself wondering why? I can not get through many zone without an escort, I can not hunt alone, and now I am not of much value,if any to a group. When I first started playing my understanding was that each class had a part to play in this world. Guess I was wrong, unless the Cleric's is that of a poor pathetic experience sucking hanger on. Since the only value of a cleric is now rezing, perhaps it is time to omit the class all together and reassign us to the druid or shaman classes. Don't know what I'm going to do but leveling my cleric anymore now seem nothing but a waste of my time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"No class should be 100% required..."<P>Why?<P>First off, clerics are not required in many cases (see all the soloing necro's and druids). <P>"If a cleric is required equipment for a warrior, maybe an enchanter is required equipment for a wizard." - Abashi many moons ago<P>DD is not balanced at higher levels.  It never has been.  IT NEVER WILL BE!  Killing with DD is a very poor method for killing.  A wizards average damage over time is much lower than a warriors.  If you want to kill stuff at a decent rate and level at a decent rate you find a melee.  Accept this, and then realize that DoT's do not stack well, then the only efficient method left for damage is melee.  This is not a cleric's fault.  It's Verants.  They made a game where the best method for killing in mid to large groups, by far, is melee.  This can be done in two ways, lots of pet classes or melee classes.  The prior approach does NOT require clerics and I've actually seen it used effectively in some cases.  Pathing and poor pet AI is the biggest problem with that approach up to level 50 or so.  Only when you take the latter approach and your at the level when clerics get superior heal (or so) does it become necessary to have a cleric.<P>Ok.... well, LOTS of people chose to play melee classes.  Not a lot of people chose to play pet classes (and many of the necro's who did choose to solo) so we're stuck, in many circumstances, with taking the melee class and cleric approach.<P>Now, get post 50 where the level of pets just doesn't go up anymore... couple that with the fact that a low to mid level 40 pet just doesn't hit a level 55 to 65 mob very well.  So at high levels you are forced to take the melee class and cleric approach again.  Can't have those pet classes being too useful in plane raids and such.<P>Now what?  Do you fix AOE spells and give players another strategic alternative for fighting in dungeons?  Do you fix the pet classes so the pet melee contribution at high levels is acceptable?<P>What they did was basically add more healing power to the game and gave most melee classes equivalent denfense skill to a warrior.  This, however, makes the game easier.  Can't have that, so they increase healing taunt and decrease the effective taunt power of tanks.<P>What does this mean?  Less control over MOBs.  More deaths in general.  How much more?  No clue, have to do some testing.  If it's not too much of a change it'll be ok... it will just make enchanters more of a necessity.  If it's too much of a change it's going to result in a lot of cleric deaths (followed shortly thereafer by any druids/shamans trying to heal the cleric, followed by any remain hybrids that had been casting and then the warrior who's been taunting his heart out the whole time.)  If this happens make friends with an enchanter who has similar playing hours to you (or if you can find a bard who didn't retire during the nearly 2 year fiasco that verant referred to as "a balanced class" before fixing their resists).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Etadanik stated:<P>--Begin Quote--<P>Either way, soloing is not a scapegoat, because it is merely a feature for certain classes, not even considered a "viable form of advancement" by Verant past 50. And we are talking about post 50, if you haven't noticed already, not pre-50 when druids could have soloed, but post-50 where the game changes and druids/shamans seldom solo anymore. <P>--End Quote--<P>Tell that to the post-50 druids that regularly quad-kite wyverns in Cobalt Scar on the Fennin Ro server. You can find them there with regularity, happily cherry-picking the highest leveled wyverns from the bunch, aggroing them, then snaring and kiting them all around until they all fall into a nice little tight group. A few zaps from a Lum stick until they are dead, wash and repeat.<P>Don't give me any rubbish about post-50 druids and how they "seldom solo anymore" - I see it on the Fennin Ro server, and on a regular basis. God forbid that CLERICS should ever be burdened with that kind of a "feature"; I'd *love* for my cleric to be able to port - OR SoW - OR evac - OR quad-kite. My cleric could do two things well pre-patch that set the cleric class apart from the other classes; my cleric could heal far better than any other class, and he could res.<P>With the healing gap drastically reduced between the classes and the new and improved hate-list implemented, it makes the cleric class a one-trick class; nothing but glorified ressers. We will see how many people start new clerics with these new cleric-class "featues" in place.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Especially since the new healing nerf is not supposed to come into effect pre lvl 50. Im betting the cleric deathrate will skyrocket.<BR>   I guess it just serves you guys right - that's what you get for having the nerve to try and kill a god or dragon in Verants world </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
