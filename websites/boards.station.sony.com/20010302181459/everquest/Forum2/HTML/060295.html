</FONT><HR>Hello all <P>I just want to make this post on epic quests there a joke. none of them are balanced like they should have been heck i dont' think anyone who came up with the quests even tested them. I got this feeling when talking to the people who worked on the quests at fan faire.<P> they seemed clueless then and the quests seem unbalanced and even more clueless now i have been working on getting my componets for my Mage epic for months now and have yet to get the important items &lt;crown from air. staff from inny. staff from kedge&gt; these items are to rare and to hard to get.<BR> <BR>If killing the mob was the prob then its not a prob i have tons of friends that could help me kill any mob in game the prob is the mobs are rarely up when they are up there farmed and even when farmed they drop the items one in a million.<P>Now i have spent months trying to get these items with no luck and many friends of mine have put in much more time then i have on it. a friend of mine is a 53 rouge and about 2 weeks ago she and i were talking and she said she was going to start her epic quest i told her cool and good luck that the quest were next to impossable to complete. i got tell from her yesterday saying she was about to finish the quest and sure enough within the next two hours she had her epic with less then 2 weeks time in it. <P>Now i ask you is this fair that i have to spend months of camping and begging for my quest items when others classes have theres handed to them? are there wepons more important then mine?  Is there class better or more important then mine?<P>I think not all I see anymore is the stupid posts on how they want the classes balanced I am happy to an extent with my class what I do want is the same fair chance at my epic wepon thats not to much to ask <P><BR>SO PLEASE SOMEBODY WITH THE GUTS KNOW HOW AND BRAINS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS DO IT AND FIX THE PROBS WITH THESE QUESTS <P>Thanks <BR>Namin Soulburner <BR>Leader <BR>Unitd powers of Norrath </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>you know friend ..<P>if the epic quest difficulty was proportional to the power of the item, id understand if some epics were harder to get than others.<P>But they arnt are they. A rogue with his epic is vast improvement over a necro or enchanter with theirs.<P>Once again verant .. 3 thumbs down for a poor job.<BR>You have once again put insufficient thought into an implimented concept and make alot of people very frustrated and angry.<P>You people need some new staff members.

</FONT><HR>i disagree<P>the rogue epic may be easier but in that more people will get the rogue epic and seeing on a person wont have that cool value anymore. The harder epics that fewer will be able to get will be the ones that people will gawk at for a long time to come. <P>I for one dont want them to become common.

</FONT><HR>Ok maybe i did't realy get the idea i wanted across i don't nessacearly want the mage epic or any other quest made eaiser.all tho i think all epic quest items needs to be put on diffrents mobs of equal or harder difficulty. <P> What i do want is for all the quests to be equal these are the best wepons in game for all classes i am a proud mage and i like my class I would like to see my epic someday now if i have to put alot of work and time into it thats fine. But i dont' want joe blow who has put very little time in his class and his quest getting the best wepon in the game in less then 2 weeks thats an insult to all classes who have to put in the work for theres.<P><BR>Now what i think should be done is all the quests need to be looked at from top to bottom get a tester on the live server and have them do the quest start to finsh or at least look at level of mobs drop rates on items number of items needed to finish the quest. look at how the mobs that drop the items fit into the world &lt;are they available to everyone or controled by a select few&gt; then once you have collected all the data put them in a chart compare all aspects of the quests and change them either make them all as hard as the most diffucult quest or make them meet in the middle. <P>This is the only fair thing to do for all classes no one class is more inportant then the other and no one class should have it any eaiser then the other when it comes to the most uber wepon in the game <P>Namin Soulburner<BR>leader <BR>United Powers of Norrath <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Three things: First, I always wonder if the people who come on and complain about their Epic quests being too hard are people who were just killed in an attempt to get one of the components or lost a roll to another person present who also needed the component.<P>Second, Nam, you seem to have a good grasp of using the period at the end of each paragraph.  You need to master putting them between sentences as well (commas are nice too, but both would be a little much to ask for in one jump).  I could barely read your posts at all.<P>Finally, I am nowhere near high enough to get an epic item.  That being said, a high difficulty for them is to be expected and desired.  If these items are *truly* the pinnacle of weapons for each class, then I would think it should take at least the length of time between say level 50 and level 55 to get the things, perhaps even the length of time from level 50 to level 60.  If I were a rogue and had a much easier time getting my epic weapon, I would feel lame and cheated.  The enjoyment of this game is supposed to come during the time you play, and if epic quests are hard to complete that means you have more TIME to enjoy the game while still pursuing a goal.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><P>MY SUGGESTION, ULTIMATE SOLUTION TO MAGE QUEST PROBLEM:<P>I suggest making the earth staff the common drop off Master Yael. It fits his role as the owner of the Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth. In fact, he fits the role wonderfully.<P><BR>Master Yael has crap loot presently. This would at least give him reasonable loot. Tanks want that sword, mages want that stick, casters wouldn't mind having the robe (although it's not all that special it is at least a booby prize for coming). I suggest tuning his loot to encourage people to raid him more often. <P><BR>-------------------<P>Some background.<P>My mage is now 56. I've been actively working on the epic since he was 48. Been many many months now. However, I am pretty much stuck now and frankly see no reason to continue.<P>It was only in December that a required peice for the epic was even dropping (Burning Embers in Burning Woods). Weeks of camping there finally produced the embers after Verant finally realized (OMG!) that customers WERE correct and the embers WEREN'T dropping. The same is true for the elemental binder in the hole. <P>My heart sank when the patch to fix those two item drops went in and the other hideously rare drops were left alone while the same mobs that drop my epic peices routinely drop the epic peices for other classes.<P>...<P>Weeks of camping South Karana for Quillmane's cloak. Finally got lucky. It pretty much walked over me, thankfully, since I don't have tracking and I had long since exhaused my friendly tracker friend's patience on the issue. Begging trackers on a daily epic doesn't exactly feel epic btw.<P>Killed Phinegal in Kedge a bunch of times, finally got lucky on the staff. More than a few rogues got their robes tagging along with my raids.<P>Killed greens in Najena for what seemed like forever but was really only about two weeks of my gaming (about 7hrs a day average when you include the longer weekends), total nearly 100hours wiping out Najena. Not exactly epic to watch your pet kill stuff you used to exp on in your 20's.<P>Killed that lava elemental in Sol A, got the embers on the first try. Well, second. I died the first time because the gnomes assisted. I'd take an exp death over another two weeks of camping like most of the other parts had required.<P>...<P>Earth Staff? This is where I am now. I've managed to talk my guild into basically rushing Hate every chance we get. 8 times now, and no staves have even dropped to lotto. Been doing this since November at every opportunity. Let me tell you, getting 8 Inny kills in what has basically been about 3 months is basically us taking most of his spawns. Other people on the server are not exactly happy with the situation.<P>While more epic than killing greens in Najena, it is extrordinarily disappointing to see the Ranger epic peice drop off Inny nearly every time. That in and of itself is the ultimate, most frustrating, most unfair thing I have to observe every time we kill Inny. Other class epics drop with great frequency off him, yet ours is uber rare.<P>....<P>Yet a rogue can get his in literally a few days if he has even a portion of the support I have when trying to get yet another shot at a earth staff that probably won't drop.<P>It is terribly unfair.<P>I am not asking for rogue epic to be nerfed. I am asking that the mage epic be somehow modified so that the earth staff is at least a reliable drop off some mob.<P><BR>Even if common, it is hardly an unbalancing item. Mages have had focus items the majority of their career. It only raises the pet a single level. Big deal. Not imbalancing. Hardly worth the frustration this has caused your paying customer base with this arbitrarily difficult part of this quest.<P>Thanks for reading.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Nam does have a point, in that the quests and their rewards are not balanced.  I am not taking sides but some facts are:<P>1.  Some quests require multiple god/plane drops others none.<P>2.  Some quests have triggered spawns others have rare drops off rare seven day spawns.<P>3.  Some quests components are purchaseable while other quests use many no-drop items.<P>4.  Some quests can be done largely solo with just a few spots needing guild help while others its an almost raid mentality for many steps.<P>5.  Some quests require items from that classes <BR>specific quests, while some require no rewards from that classes specific quests.<P>6.  Many quests require nice items that our useable by other classes and increases the loot pool wanting the items.<P>7.  Some quests require the questor to ruin certain positive factions while others have no faction reprucussions.<P>To the author of this comment:<BR>"The harder epics that fewer will be able to get will be the ones that people will gawk at for a long time to come. "  I have a one word comment - QUACK!<P>The quests rewards are not balanced still.  Many epic quests rewards granted a new ability to the class (Shaman's got a Splurt type DOT) or granted them one of thier best spells with no mana (clerics lvl 56 rezz).  Other epic quests grant worse versions of lower level spells (necros get a darkness spell worse than their lvl 49 version).<P>I know Verant said we should not compare the quests to each other but how can you not?  This is a grouping game, if it takes a guild to do the quests then the guild is probably gonna want a grp benefit by obtaining the epic not something "situational".  In addition, the effect on EVERY epic should be unique - the druid and necro items share the same effect.<P>I think Verant needs to make the quests more equal in some regards.  If god/plane drops are gonna be required, then make them required for all quests.  If a reward from a class specific quests is required, then make it required for all classes not just some.  Spawns should either be all triggered or all rare multiple day spawns.<P>Current epic drops should be looked at and potentially moved to other mobs for consideration.  Vox and Naggy now have level caps - bad choices for epic quests.  Drops of a 1/30 (black silk cape from PoA) chance verses an always drop should be balanced as well.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I usaully don't post but I see alot of stuff going on about the epic weapons.  I've yet to see someone bring up the point that even if these spawns and items are really hard to get and take alot of time maybe they don't want these floating around and have the servers "epic hero" to achience some of these weapons.  Of course some are easier than others, and I would personally like to see all these quest waste endless hours of your time, because sitting around farming inny isn't the idea i think they had when they implemented epic quests.  I mean do they really want everyone running around with it.  Be there on the raids and if it drops roll wif it otherwise jsut wait it out you won't die without it.  <P>Just a note I know all quests are equal and thats rather messed up, but its how i see everything as of now</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

The rest I DOUBT I will bother to try to get until, AGAIN, I get into that super mega guild that is willing to put the INSANE amounts of effort to get the quest for EACH over 50.<BR>I just want the epics to be EQUALLY epic and EQUALLY worth the work. I don't like the fact that 15 people can get X epic and no Mages can EVER hope to get it even in super mega guild after YEARS of work.<BR>PS NERF NOTHING, bring all to the HIGHEST point, and least difficulty level NOT taking all the the MAGE epic quest difficulty level.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have to agree with many of the mentioned problems with the epic drops.  While the mage epic is the hardest and the most rewarding imo, the absolute rarity of all the things you know tons of mages will be looking for is pretty ugly.<BR>Quests arent fun because of the amount of time you put in.  I quit playing for 2 months after a 50 hour camp of the priest of najena.<BR>And whats with nice and rare items for one class being used in another's epic?  Very unfair to pretty much take such an item away from the only class that can use it.  lol, Im pretty sure it's a lot of people's dream to twink a Robe of Miragul on to a level 1 gnome enchanter. hmmm maybe not on PVP.....<P><BR>Why not have a series of GM events that involve getting some of these rare epic drops.<P>They could create a fun and new situation each time, scrambling to assemble raids last minute, in random places, against mobs that are spoken of but never seen, like Lord Mistmoore, or with cool new mobs (hopefully with interesting storylines)<BR>Im sure a lot of your GM's would jump at a chance to do this (rather than getting *****ed at)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Heres a good point that has yet to be included. While, yes, inny does drop the emerald almost every kill, there are usually at least 2x the amount of rangers in hate as mages on average. Not to mention that the emerald is worthless unless you have the stone from venril sathir, which druids need as well. Then there is the jade reaver, which unless you win during a raid, you usually end up having to pay 10k+ for it.<P>Now dont get me wrong, i'm not complaining about my quest being too hard or trying to say that your wrong or whatever, because I'm not and your not. The mage epic is tough. However, a good amount of the items needed were in the game long before the epics were even initiated. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
