</FONT><HR>Dear fellow EverQuest players-<BR>  I have a dilemma in which i need your help. I have created a character named Caution. This name was allowed by the filter over a year ago. Six months ago he reached the 2oth level and I choose a last name of Explosive. In order for me to get my last i had to petition. Therefore the name Caution Explosive was allowed by GMs. On 11/19/00 I reported a bug to the Gms. During this time they Now considered my last name inappropriate and proceed to delete it. When I repeatedly ask for a reason they refered to rule number 6. Rule number 6 states "Common words and phrases that would not be found in the place and time setting of the game (e.g. Switchblade, Phaser, Toaster, Cannabis, Sloegin)." Since the words caution and explosive ARE relative to the game setting why was my named change? IF you think that that is all listen to this. When asking for a explanation of why it was inappropriate I was ignored. Since I repeatedly ask a gm for a explanation I was PROMTLY BANNED from EQ for 7 days. I am asking for the players of EQ to give me some feedback on this issue if they think it was inappropriate or not. Please all comments are welcome.<BR>IN addition this happened to 5 other friends of mine in the party that i was in.<P>	Caution<BR>	-30th lvl Banned De <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

If in the other hand he felt annoyed by somebody asking the same question over and over I would understand his behaviour. I don't know exactly what happened, but nothing seems to be obviously wrong.<P>Shawson is right, your last name should not have been accepted and then refused, but if they think they made a mistake, it is ok to try to correct it, provided the GM gives you good explanation.<P>Nohky<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Based on what you've said, which may not be all the 'facts' - nothing personal, just don't know you - I would say that they were a bit jerky about they way they handled this. To an extent, I agree with that which was said about you repeatedly asking them about it. I would very much like to see the reply/replies they (have) sent you. You have every right to be irate, I would be. However, getting upset and hounding someone will not make the situation better.

</FONT><HR>Their mistake wasn't really the subsequent refusal. It was allowing it in the first place, IMO. Caution Explosive is hardly an appropriate fantasy name now, is it? However, if they're gonna allow it then, totally agree, it's not right that they then rescind it after all that time.<P>As to the banning, well, it's heat-of-the-moment stuff. Chzgr8r was more-or-less there. They gave you a reason. Right or wrong, agree or disagree. It's their world and we have to take it up the pipe if that's where they wanna put it. Sending a GM tells, especially repeatedly, is a sure-fire way to have an enforced vacation...  :/<P>FWIW, I hope you get back on OK. Maybe try Menatwork for your next surname, if that's ya bag...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>How sad, in my mind if i ever have a problem with the game I just drop it, usualy its not names with me (except for my chanter haveing the last name of crackdealer, not that I have any reason to question why they took that name..heh) my problems are always with other players, for instance lets take the other night, I was sitting in BW medding while some jerk comes along and runs 3 giants over the top of me and i end up getting killed, I say nothing because, yeah it happens, I wanst by a zone or in a high traffic area, but sometimes you are kite killing and you dont see the person untill its too late and your on top of them, anyway, not more than 2 mins here comes the same person yet again, trains 3 mobs over the top of me, of course just being resed i havent had a chance to loot or get any mana to do anything, i die this time and loose my 2nd corpse, then another few mins, and there I happen to see the same monk run more mobs my way, but this time I see him FD behind me, well..now I see that he isnt a caster and is intentionaly killing me ro splitting the mobs over the top of me, one way or another I ask him to please stop pulling stuff over the top of me, he tells me F*** Y**,  now do i dare to report this or not?  A few mins goes by and i decide to report what was said, yes if your thinking there has to be more to the soory your right, the monk said some harsh things to me, and i exchanged a few words with him, who would'nt?  anyway an hour goes by, a gm finnaly responds to my petition and asks me if i got the offending text with a /report, I tell the GM yes, then the GM tells me they will review it and take action..oh yeah this makes me feal better, i lost 3 bbls of un recoverable xp, got cussed out by another player for something i didnt do, the whole point to my post is that, I dont think the GM's do a very good job, just abuse there power, I try to avoid them all together, I use my /ignore list alot and I also play diffrant 50+  chrs, cleric included, when someone does wrong to me i add them to the igfnore list, at somepoint that person will want a port or a res...heh<P>happy hunting to everyone<BR>Gthorn D'Nuker</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hiya!<BR>It's just a game? Well when ppl start coming on with the name "Hornygurl" and "blowjobqueen" I'm quite frankly disturbed and sickened because the name passed the filter. Names like "Grater Powur" are just normal words mashed so you can (or think you can) look good or be cool. Some of the lastnames like "Swifthammer" or "Fireblade" make sense. Alot of the old RP lastnames referred to occupation and some sort of element or action. <BR>I believe the GM wasn't in the wrong..he gave you an explanation. You persisted because you prolly wanted to hear what you wanted to hear..not what he said.<BR>-= Not all who wonder are lost =- [Tolkien]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

About hounding the GM is wrong, but they SHOULD answer you question so you can fully understand their motivation. Not so dman rulebook. By the Verant sucks and so does its staff. I DON'T CARE IF YOU BAN ME, THIS IS NOT RIGHT Verant does suck. The so called GM service is nothing more than someone always there to tell you to go screw yourself. I hate Verant by the way. They should had left you be. In a while names will be very scarce. I mean who would go with the name Ryttoesian, it gave me that as a choice once and Zzerialleds as one to. It is too long and just plain stupid. Let us make whatever name we want. As long as if it would be permitted for a kid to say on stage in front of a preschool audience or something. They had once canceled one of my name Chickenhead. They waited for me to log in and sent me a tell, telling me I had to change it from a choice of 25 set names. I chose Lanne, not too bad but man it sucks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I can remember when i wanted to become a guide. {laughs to herself} I think it would have been cool, but I do not think I could deal with all the spoiled people in the game. I think people are too quick to say "Verant Sucks". I do not think they suck, however i do feel that they may be understaffed. So far evertime I have had to contact a GM in game, I have gotten a speedy answer/help. Heck one night it was kinda slow and I got the chance to talk to a guide for a bit. It was very interesting to hear the guide's point of view. And even still i think it would be fun to be a guide, to get the chance to help other players, but at the same time i would not like dealing with all the punks out there that only wanna hear what they wanna hear.<P>My thoughts are if all the BSers will stop wasting the GMs time with stupid petitions (and multiple ones even after the answer is given) then the GMs could serve the rest of the gaming community quicker and in a better mood( since they are not pissed off by jerks).<P>If you are pissed off with an answer you ruling made by a GM, send an inteligent letter to Verent.<P>~Thanx and have a magical day~</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum16&number=16&thisthread=000017&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum16&number=16&thisthread=000017&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
