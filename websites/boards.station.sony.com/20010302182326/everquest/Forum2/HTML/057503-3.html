Welcome to level 49!<P>15 deaths in 22 levels (notice that I dinged 34 twice, since I died right after I got 34, then got a rez).<P>I went through the following levels without dying at all:<BR>28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 44, 48.<P>Dragoon Darl killed me because I was helping a friend kill Brawn in the Ocean of Tears, and I screwed up and killed the sirens, causing Darl to spawn.  I killed the other Dragoon there, but between them they killed my pet and Darl got me.<P>Goonda killed me at 34 because I was hanging about near his camp, watching basically, cause I'd never seen anyone fighting there before.  The necro soloing the camp went LD, and Goonda, instead of attacking the necro's pet (which was beating Goonda to death), decided to come after me, even though I had not done anything to him.  I almost escaped... until Goonda cast SoW on himself, caught up, and beat me to death.<P>Four of the five deaths at level 35 were because I stupidly tried to do a bunch of quest stuff solo, instead of getting help first.  None of those were fighting in regular groups; none of those were fighting solo for exp.  Those were all regular, solo quest attempts, and I died fighting greens (Sindlegrob, stone skeletons, and the isle goblin headmaster were all green to me at 35).<P>The hill giant was a legitimate group death, although I was in a group of 3 necros and 3 mages... and somebody had to be the puller.  And it was me.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  I died because I pulled a hill giant without noticing the one nearby that aggroed also...<P>At level 40 I died 3 times, this time I was exploring though.  Actually, with the blazing elementals in Sol A, I was leading a guild raid of Sol A, and I'd never been to that part of the dungeon before, so naturally I fell into the BE pit, and trained all 3 of them out with me, and got killed by them before I could get back to our healers.  The evil eye killed me, although there were two minotaurs there also beating on me, because I got trained by a stupid guy in Lower Guk who claimed we could take them all easily.<P>The drolvarg was a legitimate group kill; someone feared a drolvarg it without snaring it, so our pets took off after it, and aggroed two other drolvargs nearby.  And SoW ran out *while I was fleeing them*.  Smack, smack, dead.<P>The death at 43 was during a Vox raid.  I fully expected to die.<P>The shadow beast killed me while I was exploring, I was not soloing or in a group.<P>The hill giant killed me while I was trying to solo, because I didn't have SoW.<P>The zombie trooper killed me because I tried to find a dread wolf in Kithicor at night... by myself.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>The dar ghoul knight killed me because I ran into the dead side, past the safe hall, without realizing that I didn't have Invis vs. Undead up.  Oops.<P>Total levels gained: 22<BR>Total deaths: 15<BR>Total deaths while I was soloing/grouping for experience: 4<P>If I had not been stupid those other 11 times, I would have died exactly FOUR TIMES in TWENTY-TWO LEVELS.<P>I soloed all or most of the following levels:<BR>32, 33 - Splitpaw spire 3, in South Karana<BR>36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 48 - The Overthere<P>34-35 were done mostly in The Overthere, but I grouped the entire time.  36 was done partly grouping in the Overthere.  40 was done in random places, including Lower Guk and Sol B.  44-47 were done in the Dreadlands, Karnor's Castle, and Lower Guk.  I'm 49 now, and I've done a bit in City of Mist (no deaths).<P>When I soloed a level straight, it never took more than 7 hours to do.  (I did level 48 in The Overthere in around 7 hours.)<P>If nothing else, this proves that a mage *certainly can* do quite well without dying all the time, Petoffen.<P>- Teramenor<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Xelene, please stay on subject. so far, you've done nothing but take easy way by answering minor remarks i made..ignoring main point. so what is it?<P><BR>as for your non-related remark...<BR>"So your Warrior, SK, Ranger, Cleric, and all those other classes you listed die less often than your mage?"<BR>- of course not. once again, let me repeat it for you. Do you run into a mob 30~40 below you and fear that you will likely die? all the other classes don't, and i gave you reason why. well?<P>"Or maybe your Warrior dies in combat more, since once he finds out the cleric's oom, it's too late to run? Maybe your cleric dies pretty often when he overaggros from healing and the tanks can't pull off him and the chanter's oom. Maybe your Ranger dies because he has low HP, but high taunt from his damage."<BR>- If you can't trust your group to keep you alive, perhaps you should look for better circle of friends?<P>"While your mage, in combat, stays relatively safe."<BR>- my mage stays untouched because i know how not to get on mob's aggro list. By now, you should know better than to stay on top of aggro list(unless you want to...main tank/taunt it off someone else..etc)<P>"Does your mage die more, or just at different times? Be really honest with yourself here."<BR>- honestly, my mage never dies on my fault. it's either monk pulling big train on raid by accident. or getting DT by uber mobs. Which makes it worse, name one class besides mage who fears lv29 mob at lv58? (full mana, full health, whatever). <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>brin_summer,<P>Ok, if your mage doesn't die noticeably more often than your other characters, that is not a justification for getting better escape spells.<P>I wasn't trying to say that these things happen to me all the time or anything.  I was trying to point out that all classes suffer from death on occasion.  Your only argument heretofore has been "They all have it, I want it."  If you want it that bad, change character classes.  If you don't want to give up what you have as a mage to get it, then stop complaining about what you don't have.  If you can come up with an actual reason why mages should have it, beyond saying that everyone else has it, fine... but no more sandbox whining about what others have that you don't, ok?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ok a few notes about my successes (although I don't keep them as well documented as some people) I have died once on my present mage who is half way through 30, that was while I was soloing in the gator pit in cazic about 3 days ago hehe  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">, my last mage made it to 42 without a single death, guess why? because he didn't do anything he choose his camps for safty he stayed with safe stable xp. I now have a total of 137 lvls worth of mage experience under my belt, and in safe conditions mages are awesome (2nd only to necro's for sheer proficency), in conditions which are in any way the least bit unpredictable (80% of group situations) I would rather have any of the other classes INCLUDING a ranger. Mages are good in there nitch but I am sorry they are nowhere near good enough at that nitch to deserve absolutely no defence, it simply is not justified.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Mage is balanced to 50.. but not balanced after 50..<P>If y ou havn'et played a mage from 51 - 60 then do'nt think you know what a mage can or cannot do.  Mage really need a defensive spell.  We got aboslutely no defensive spell at all.  Even an SK has damage absorbing skin and mage does not.<P><BR>Suppie Yo<BR>Arch Mage<BR>Legacy of Sorrow<BR>Luclin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057503-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057503.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057503-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057503&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057503&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
