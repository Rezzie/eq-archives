</FONT><HR>Nice post Dresden.  I like those ideas/thoughts.<P>I read Alan's response (or one of his responses) to one of the myriad players challenging them to come up with a logical/valid argument for the nerfing of the item.  <P>&gt;&gt;"The changes to these healing items are being made in quick succession due to the simple fact that we have reevaluated the idea of healing powers given to items, and for no other reason."<P>He neglected to mention that "healing items" were not the only thing nerfed in his "quick succession of changes"...thus downplaying this fact...how quaint.  <P>So, someone at VI has decided to "re-evaluate the idea of healing powers given to items" thus giving them carte blanche permission to do/justify any nerf/changes they wish regardless of consequence to the players.  This does not answer the players question, there was no logical justification given.  Smug, patronizing drivel does not constitute a valid or logical reason.  Yeah, "it's their game/their world etc." boo yah and whoopie.<P>I see no "positive balancing" done to the class before or after their "quick succession of changes" to show how much they a. care b. know what they are doing.<P>&gt;&gt;"I can address the faction issue. There were/are alternate ways to get those items. The faction loss was a choice the player made to get the item one way rather than the other. We won't be changing any factions over this."<P>Oh well, those who have ruined their Fay faction...they will not be fixing it for you.  Frankly I'm shocked...not.  They are quick to "twist the screw of nerf", and then show how much they care.<P>I'm still waiting for these "supposed" class changes that are coming up to see what they actually do (positive/fun/useful) for the class...as opposed to chain nerf in the name of "re-evaluation" and "VI mob intelligence improvement".<P>Oh, while they are at it, they should re-examine the other PoG cleric armor pieces.  Most of them have no effect on them at all.  We definitely need those pieces to have level 20-30ish spell effects put on them to maintain consistency.<P>~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Thx info. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Faction issue: The PoG BP was discovered before any of the quest BP's were. Hence for quite some time it essentially was not a choice. People are not psychic, faction should be reset. At the very least simply as some kind of "we don't hate you" gesture. <P>"This is not an attack" &lt;-- Then what do you  consider an attack? It's all a matter of perspective. To you it's not an attack, to us it is, intent really is not the issue. If the US government were to decide "Oregan is a useless state and is more harm then good to the nation (I just pulled that outta my hat btw, don't kill me all you Oreganans) so we are booting them from the Union. Don't you think Oregan would consider that an attack? My point being, there is not always one right answer. You are attacking Clerics, whether you like it or not. A good choice would have been to spread these out a bit, put some improvements in between them. Sure it would have only changed persepective, but isn't that the whole issue?<P>New effect: Like I stated in an early thread. Leave the bp as is. Change the effect so that it still does the exact same thing, however it removes all stamina for the duration of the heal. That pretty much nukes its usefullness during a fight, but leaves it extremely usefull during downtime, or to save someones life. I think this was the original intent anyway. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I just wanted to express my support for Absor and Verant on this change.  I cannot believe how people could complain about the nerfing of this obviously overpowered item.  If mobs were designed with these BP's in mind, then change the mobs.  In fact I think A LOT of the right clickable effects on Velious and Kunark items these days is out of control.  They should be helpful effects, not essential effects.<P>My only fear is that Verant will replace the effects on these breastplates with something equally overpowered in a feeble attempt to placate the the very vocal minority of squeeky wheel Clerics.  Then we'll have to go through this again in a month or two.  DO NOT REPLACE THE EFFECT WITH SOMETHING EQUALLY ABSURDLY POWERFUL.  NERF IT ONCE AND FOR ALL AND BE DONE WITH IT.<P>Skellt</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One interesting point about the introduction of the Donal's BP and the PoG BP. Donal's BP came out many months earlier than the PoG armor did. Anyone else notice this?<P>In fact, they made 3 or 4 versions of the PoG BP to top off their "supposed mistake" in a long succession of "supposed mistakes" which mysteriously continue to "happen". <P>PoG armor came out with the MOST RECENT expansion. Donals was with the PREVIOUS expansion which is nearly a year ago now at least? Where is the accountability at VI for testing this stuff?<P>Yes, let us continually introduce items with admittedly unbalancing effects (or so we claim...AFTER the fact) into the game so we can then nerf them after a good % of the player population gets them in the name of "re-evaluation". Who is the supervisior in charge of the "high level gimp working for VI who happens to be in an uber guild" that supposedly (as Absor/Abashi claims) designed the PoG BP? Who is this supervisors' supervisor? Who is taking responsibility for these "mistakes"? What are you giving back the clerics to show them you care?<BR>What have you done for me lately? Heh.<P>Bleh to you is all I can think of VI.<P>"All your GEMS are belong to us"<BR>"All your NERFS are belong to us"<BR>"Bases are for people who should re-evaluate their nerfs before they implement them"<BR>"All your ACCOUNTABILITY are belong to the player for putting up with our oooga booga"<P>~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Thx info. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;~~~~~~~~~~<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>-first I don't disagree that Verant feels this is overpowering.  I can understand when they say it's hard for them to find a heal in the game that isn't either useless or overpowerful.  <P>Second,<P>I think the Aegolism taking the place is a great idea.  This would save 750 mana a buff and make the long sits of meditation alot better.  Not to overpowerful when you think about it but does save some downtime.  I am for this. The other ideas from Gates, to breeze.  In my opinion rather you leave it as is before those.

</FONT><HR>To cut down on down time, seeing as you are hell bent on nerfing the crap out of the cleric BP, make the effect of the BP a right clickable aegolism. This will save down time before and during fights without making the battle between warrior and cleric a definite success. IMO this effect would help just as much on large raids without being over powered. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

NICE!<BR>CLR (old verison) very nice effect<BR>tanks got heals on there Vel BP's, ok weak heal but its an ability outside of there sphere of normal abilities its faster than bandages and goes to full health so its good.<BR>then theres the mage robe . effect a treble redundant damage shield you simply wont use. insanely long cast time (15 seconds its seems like) not only made useless by boon of immolation and cadeau of flame but by aegis of ro to , i mean why even bother just nerf it and make it reclaim energy were really short on ways to get that effect (magi joke  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">)<P>OK feel better for getting that out.<P>now onto the cleric aspect.<P>First this BP isnt as unbalancing as you imagine.<BR>believe it or not FoH isnt a good example of the way most people play this game. ie we dont have one tank that solos everything while the rest of teh guild heals him to sate his raging napaleon complex.<P>using the CE effect has risks.<BR>a. 300 hp a tick is not a lot of HP certainly not enough to heal the damge a tank takes while aggroed even with chain casting this the tank will likely die most stuff hits for over 200 a hit nowadays.<BR>b. get a new inc or need to heal a different party member in a hurry (chanter or over nuker usually) and theres a high chance of death due to being locked into the BP cast.<P>but clearly only FOH play style has any bearing on your tuning meetings so i i guess im talking to the wall here but what the heck give it a go.<P>hmm for new effects .<BR>aegolism. doubt youll go for it due to the heal aspect of CLR buffs heals around the same amount as CE does so seems unlikely.<P>hmm could give us resolution on the BP then at least it would be as usefull as the mage robe effect.<P>what id go for is either greater heal with a 9 sec cast or sup heal with a 15 sec cast. cuts down in downtime without being any real use in fights so wont affect balance but is still usefull.<P>Ium<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hi all-<P>Several high level cleric friends of mine have been devastated by the recent changes, which have basically sucked the life out of their gameplay enjoyment.  Big negative karma hit to all at verant either responsible for the recent nerfs, or guilty of failing to stop them from happening.  Shame on you.<P>Having said that: a few, I hope well considered, ideas for the replacement effect-<P>o summon holy water: 1 charge potion, lore, norent shiney brass idol analog (i.e. instant cast divine aura).  LONG casting time + component to prevent abuse?<P>o clear aggro: instant cast with short DoT component to limit chaincasting, removes cleric from all mob aggro lists the way evade used to work for rogues.  AE?<P>o aeogism (sp?); either single target componentless cast, or group spell with reagent required; decent recast delay (15-30 seconds+) to prevent chaincasting vs. dispelling mobs.<P>o unresistable stun; just what it sounds like.<P>o best of all: PUT THEM BACK THE WAY THEY WERE!<P>Just my $.02,<BR>RdT.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here's an idea on making the Breastplate effective and limiting the usage.  It's a throw back to a player issue from the original days and has been stated "could not be done".  With the additional resources and coding talent now, though ... let's hope.<P>Problem:  Owners of BPs want the effect and casting time NOT to be nerfed.<BR>Problem:  Verant wants to balance the Breastplate within EQ<P>Give them both what they want!  How?  Give the Breastplate Charges =)  Before all the Clerics freak out ... Verant you need to implement Charges the way they were suppose to be:<P>1) On a time Counter such as 6 charges renewed daily (sunrise for good, sunset for evil).  There are now spell effects which only work during certain times of the day so some code does exist.<BR>2) Quest to recharges.  Not a LONG involved quest, but one which requires 15-30mins of busy work in the middle of two no where zones (so the cleric cannot bind and gate back).  This would allow clerics to "charge" up before events and the nights adventure, but significantly hurt trying to recharge in the middle of the battle.<P>Improve the Game, don't nerf =)<P>Aumaar Mindweaver /<BR>Maudraar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Since the days the class specific armor quests came out for clerics, I've always felt that Verant has a weird love/hate view of the class.<P>One one hand, they love group-based classes, which clerics really are.<P>On the other, clerics specifically reduce the chance of death and downtime two factors which Verant uses to create challenges in the game. A cleric's impact on how long someone can fight and how soon they can get back into the fray (as well as how fast the level) is obvious. Just the fact that Verant designed encounters with the idea that clerics would have healing breast plates makes this obvious.<P>I think Verant's view of the class combined with their policy of when they nerf something to not compensate a class for the nerf has created what appears to be a campaign again clerics.<P>Donal's BP nerf, Hate list "fix" that got cleric's killed in droves, the Velious BP nerf all come down around a time when a bunch of other classes are getting new spells, skill caps, abilities, ect.. it certainly looks like Verant has something against clerics.<P>It is my hope that Verant takes some of this into consideration soon and maybe address a few cleric issues so as to not leave the players who play clerics feeling like the game has turned against them.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here's an interesting, unique and even balanced idea for a new proc.<P>Name: Mark of DeNerf<BR>Target: Self only<BR>Cast time: Instant<BR>Effect: For each of the cleric's successful melee attacks the cleric performs a 12(?) point group heal.<P>Discussion: basically its a proc with 100% success rate. The proc is a group heal of some balanced ammount. Balancedmeaning, it should heal the group for ~33% more than the ammount that could be group healed with the mana that would be regenned with meditation, C2 and mana song2 combined in the same time frame. This would be useful when the cleric is fm, when a cleric would normally just be standing around. As it is a group heal, it is not nearly as good as medding and single target healing but it would at least allow the cleric to do something in those situations. Useful and not overpowering.<P>Formula:<BR>mana regenned per tick * (spellheal / spellcost) = heal per tick with group heal<BR>heal proc * proc % * attacks per tick = heal per tick with proc<BR>bonus = heal per tick with proc / heal per tick with group heal <BR>heal proc = ((1 + bonus) * mana regenned per tick * spellheal) / ( proc% * attacks per tick * spellcost)<P>Example:<BR>(Guess)Cleric regens 30 mana a tick with meditation a, c2 and mana song2<BR>(Guess)Cleric melees 4 times a tick with haste<BR>Word of Restoration spellheal = 750<BR>Word of Restoration spellcost = 900<BR>proc% = 100%<BR>bonus = 33%<BR>heal proc = (1.33 * 30 * 900) / (1 * 4 * 750) = 12 <P>thats a 48 pt group heal a tick, approximately the same as a bard using 2 heal songs. Not unbalancing, not overpowering, but at least useful.<P>Celandro Spellsong [Triton]<BR>57 Bard Povar<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I truly feel you should reconsider the change to the breastplate, at the very least please give us a specific example of where a high level cleric could abuse it I think we deserve that. As so many of us have pointed out, most monsters at our level do more then 300 in a tick, and on the ones that dont, we are more efficient without the bp. It was a great help, though, and made our lives easier, just as much as the free nuke on the Wizard's robe makes his life easier, especially with being able to sit as the robe is casting. Not necessary, but helpful.<P>Well, I suppose to admit defeat, I will suggest a few options for a new bp. The talk about invisibily, port to temple, clarity, is all nothing more then wishes, and I feel we dont need any of these, and clarity would be stepping into the enchanter's realm, even self only. Aegolism is interesting, but as it stands, the spell itself makes a better item effect then a spell, as its pretty much junk as a spell compared to the Druid's Protection of the Glades (As a side note, I believe Aegolism should increase hp more then heroism+Symbol, or be undispellable, to give it a reason to be cast over 3 buffs, and three dispells) As an item effect, it should be componentless, but maybe tinker with it so it doesn't add to current hp when you cast, making it unusable as a heal. I believe, though, that it should stay a heal, as that was the original reason behind the items creation. An apple for an apple, and all that. My suggestions would be Celestial Healing (Not Elixer), Divine Light, or a unique heal in the 800-1500 hp range, maybe something with a unique agro to it, if thats possible. <P>What ever we get, I think it should be unique, we clerics dont get many good choices for srmor effects, and what we have covers it, as most things go.

</FONT><HR>What I've realized during the time of playing Everquest is that Verant does not listen to their consumers...<P>They don't care what effect you want, you won't get it. Why are you people bothering to ask for aego as a BP effect?! They will NEVER give you that, are you crazy? heh<P>You want to know what they will give you? I'm willing to bet they will put shield of words as the new effect, I can just see it now.<P>Nerfing this BP was not needed, it was NOT overpowered. The donals bp WAS overpowered,it had a INSTANT heal, the CE bp is NOT NOT overpowered. <BR>I could care less if you nerf it, but this is starting to be a growing trend, and if this 'nerfing spree' continues I can guarantee you are going to lose a lot of your player base, because they just can't trust you anymore.<P>Lastly, this made me laugh that someone who plays a cleric in game decided what the effect would be, lol. What were you guys thinking putting someone who playing a cleric in game of chosing the effect, and not making sure it was ok, lol, cracks me up how sloppy your operations are over there.<P>Kastrina Troy<BR>60th High Priest</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>To post or not to post, that is the question..<P>I rarely post here, for I cannot comprehend how any human can resist the urge to hit that trackball and breeze through these posts.<P>Kudos to you if you do.<P>Anyhow, Ill try to be keep this short and simple.<P>1.) Clerics are unhappy, disappointed and feel like they are being picked on.<P>2.) Its not just the BP(s), its the bad taste still in some of our mouths from MoK, the pet, the divine light fizzle rate, and the upgrades/abilities given to other classes.<P>3.) Example of last thing stated above.  Warriors have two invis items in the game. Wizards got ITU. The logic I read in a post from a blue name was "I dont agree with clerics getting invis, but then again, I didnt really agree with wizards getting ITU either....we will look into it".  This was shortly after SoV came out if I remember correctly.  Its been months now..update us, upgrade us.....if nothing else just INFORM us.<P>4.) So now you have to find a "fix".  You need to make the clerics happy. Come to terms with us. Make an attempt to rebuild our "faith" (bad pun). Give us something fun, neat, useful...but not overpowering.  Its going to take some thought....and I am not sure I have THE answer, but Ill provide some guidelines as what not to do, to avoid further "Verant hates clerics" posts.<P>a.) Invis...hrmm, tough call here.  Its on Warrior legs...and (see above) the whole wizard/ITU thing.  I personally, as much as I would love to have invis, do not think it belongs on a BP...it belongs in the spellbook, or on another item.<P>b.) Heals, in general.  Donals arms...in the bank. PoG legs...havent clicked them in weeks.<BR>Donals BP, POG Bps...I wont go there, we all know that story.  Stay away from heals, its not going to work.  It will either be too much, or too little, we all know this by now.<P>c.) Buffs.  Another interesting topic.  Our hp buffs could serve as heals (see Donals arms nerf) so then we look at having either a buff several levels below or one with an insane cast time.<P>  c1.) Aego would be nice, but would have to have an insane cast time to be "fair" because of the healing power it would have.  UNLESS, you used the Donals BP type of "rez effect" that allowed it only to be cast on a person if the buff was not already present, or fading (if the coding allows)<P>  c2.)Group Marzin...another nice one. Would make a lot of cleric friends here.  Make the cast time two minutes, I wouldnt care.  Group Naltron is nice, but to me, buffing with Naltron is like a 54 enchanter casting group clarity because its "easier".  Its not the best I have to offer.  You make us happy two ways here.  A new, useful buff, and lower that reagent cost (make it cost 2, 3 peridots if you must).<P>   c3.) An ac buff, better yet, a group ac buff.  Pallie BPs have SoW as their effect.  If I didnt already know this, hell, I probably would have settled for SoW.  Considering that "impressive" /smirk drop rate on Donals Gaunts and the high mana cost of our ac buffs...this might be the way to go.  However, as pallies already have SoW on their Bp, and they fall at least a circle behind us in spellcasting you now have to look at either giving us Group SoW, BoF, or Group BoF.  Call it Havusins Bond...just because I thought of it.  I wanna be famous.  Our Ac buffs cost a ton of mana, this is another way to make some more clerics happy.<P>   c4.) A new or hybrid skill.  This is more your territory than mine. Im not on the "Team" but you read (at least some of) these posts.  What is wrong with the cleric class? What do you think would put some smiles on these clerics faces? Mana regen? We have heard it time and time again. Tough call, I do not envy your position. You could have the manastone logic resurfacing.."people dont want me around because I dont have the BP of mana regen..." waaah.  These BPs are a "perk", they are a "reward".  Failure or success on a raid of any mob should not be based on any effect given to an item.  Make it that, make it a reward for collecting gems in DN, or spending some QT in PoG.  These items are "sugar" in the coffee, nothing more.  <P>Make the game "Sweeter" for the cleric class with your decision, thats all I ask. We deserve it, just as the other classes do.<P>Havusin Mooz<BR>Templar Of Quellious<BR>Failed miserably at "keeping it short"<BR>Wraith <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Verant with its latest change to the Cleric breastplate has just followed it ongoing tradition of nerfing any asspect of the game that whould apear to let player level at a faster rate then they whould like . One of the fist major things in this line was the manastone folowed by numberous other big and small nerfs inculding the necklace of superioity ect. Other changes inc making origanal dragons like Nafagen and Vox only killable by players below 53 now i hear verant is planing on changing the origanl Gods Cazic and Innoruok probly to make it harder for players to do there epic quests. Certainly not becuse the items that drop on them are that great. With the realease of kunark there where many drops and much loot to be had by all by after a few months this soon dried up with verant lowing the drop rates incredably to very little or in smae cases removing the drops all togher in the case of the 10 ac 7 str ring that used to drop off giants or nerfing a mob so much to make him a joke Ie the lvl 60 emporeor in selbis who used to drop 1-2 lvl 57- 60 spells everytime u killed him now your lucky if he drops 1 spell. Velious hasnt been long to follow kunarks example with Plane of growth having its drop rate lowed so much that your lucky to get 1 piece of amrour off a regualr mob after spending a whole day there with 20 ppl.<BR>Other nerfed spawns inc Lozdail the lvl 60 turtle who used to spawn around 1 time a Rl day now your lucky to see him every 3 days.<BR>The cleric Breastplate from pog and the 3 others with effect celestial healing r now USELESS with a 1 minute casting time any lvl 59 or 60 cleric who can cast this spell normaly will do so rather then use the breastplate simply cause with clarity 2 any cleric can med the mana back for casting the spell faster then the 1 minute casting time on the breastplate which they can even sit and med for the casting duration of the spelll (yet another nerf for the great nerfers at everant).<BR>In closing all i can say is i cant wait for another oneline game to be realeased like UO2 or shadowbane,Anarchy online ect so i can leave this world of EVERNERF. My only conclusion when trying to figure out why they do this is because they dont want everone geting bored with there game too fast before they can coem up with new stuff to do so they want to slow down everyones progress as much as possible. Lowering good loot drop rates ... making hard boos fights require more and more players ect....<BR>My last gripe is why is it that verant revome items like the manastone and necklace of superiority and many others and yet allow all the ppl who have them to keep them ? if they are SOOO unblanceing why leave them in the game... simply cause they dont wish to lose customer who whould be justifbly outraged at losing those items and think that those who havent had the chance to get them will just ignore it and take it quitely .Well i can assure u that everquest will die a very fast death as soon as anything semi decent comes out and players will show verant there thanks for all the Nerfs they have brought them and kiss goodbye to NERFWOLRD!!!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You still never answer the question of when you are going to retune the mobs you created around these breastplates. Maybe you did and I missed it, but I dont think so. Verant admittedly made mobs like King Tormax, King Dain, Velktor etc... with the Donal and the Celestrial Healing BP's in mind. While you nerf the BP you do not Nerf the Mobs. I would suggest that you dont mess with the bp til you are ready to retune the mobs. This is highly upsetting to watch your absolute Lack of Vision --  Yes lack of Vision - you are way to reactionary to have a vision</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Healings Items,<BR>I just wanted to see what the thoughts would be on this.  Lets take Donnals BP,  Have 10 charges on it.  Buy the cleric can replace a charge by casting a CHEAL into the bp.  (We would probaly need a new spell for this)  But the game should be able to do this.  If rangers can cast a spell onto thier swords then replacing a lost charge should not be to difficult.  If the BP had 10 charges then they could reduce the casting time to what a normal CHEAL would be.  <P>Shrug,  Just a thought<P>Laters<BR>Zav</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Put an unresistable version of JOLT on the BP. As fro faction, you know Tunarean Court isn't the only faction involved. The questers had to pick between Dwarf and Giant factions. If they chose based on the BP they wanted (and they aren't identical) then it's perfectly logical for them to want their factions restored after you have destroyed the payoff they were working towards</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
