</FONT><HR>Alan:<P> With the first shaman talk thread you stated i think stat buffs are a defining characteristic of shamans and dont believe they are near worthless as one poster stated.You said convince me.Now probably 7 threads and hundreds of statements explaining the exact effect (as close as we can determine them).I think as this has been the single biggest complaint by shamans we deserve some kind of answer.<P> A simple statement,I will ask the developers to look into true value of stat buffs to see if players complaints are valid.You could even add the disclaimer even if true there may be no changes.If we had received this or any similar statement many of the replys thru the last 7 threads would never have been posted.<P> Original programmers nerfed stat effects to prevent twinking making real determining factor on hitting ATTACK and real defense factor ARMOR CLASS.Unfortunatly kunark and velious developers assume stats work as they should and are leaving shamans farther behind with each new expansion.Oh goody a new plus 10 dex buff,who needs a 1500 DOT.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm going to quote a couple of responses in the General forum on a new topic regarding complete healing that were particularly well said.<P>This is regarding the TOPIC: Healing<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>----------<BR> <BR> <BR>InnoruukSK said,<P>Hmm.<P>Someone said that without Cheal,just watch anyone even try to take on those L65 mobs. <P>Guess why the mob is so freaking tough?<P>Because it was built by people watching clerics and warriors together,the warrior's lifebar regenning completely every 30 seconds or so. They then built monsters to be challenging to this.<P>The only class that can keep up with this rate of damage is the cleric who heals,and the warrior who can absorb that much damage and remain standing(doubly so with Defensive).<P>There's an account of a Velketor run in the SK talk on the Hybrid board-the speaker was a very bitter SK that lamented that they didn't have enough warriors-only four-to keep up with the damage the Sorcerer put out,so they all died twice trying.<P>He couldn't even contribute.<P>When monsters have to crank out doubles for 850 and quads for 1600 or so to be "challenging",the game is broken and requires retooling BADLY.<P>Cheal is mudflation of the highest order. But the problem cannot be fixed by nerfing Cheal. It requires both nerfing the monsters at the highest levels,rethinking methods of "challenging" to include making ALL classes have a reason to be there,and then ALSO reducing the power of Cheal. Making it like the Donal's BP effect-an undispellable "buff" that lasts 7-10 minutes-turns it into an emergency save-your-target's butt spell as opposed to a supra-healing machine that mobs have to be equipped with chainguns just to keep up. <P>But when they do that,melee damage,resistances,and HP totals need to be rethought as far as "epic" monsters go,and different ways of being a threat to players need to be put in that REQUIRE different methods than "throw the gang of warriors at it,then throw the clerics in behind them to make sure they win.".<P>Cheal being changed isn't the solution,merely part of what will work-else we can watch EQ slide further up the power level into total mindless mudflation.<P>Anyone here want that? No? Good.<P> <BR> <BR>----------<BR> <BR> <BR>Tetrasodium said, "Honestly CHeal *is* too powerful, when you have designers saying things like "mobs need to be designed to take out a fully buffed tank in under 30 seconds, less if you have multiple clerics because of this spell" that should set off a serious alarm in your head."<P><BR>----------</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> All they would have to do is admit that from 1 upgrade to the next is not a major improvement,and consider stat buffs a secondary line of spells.No complaints pre 50 as original designers put plenty of new spells each spell level.As good and varied as any caster.Kunark and velious is where things began to go bad.Call stat buffs secondary,and give us a couple NEW useful spells pre level 55 and we'll be happy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR> Absor, I must say I don't envy your position in reviewing the class specific posts. You are to be commended for your effort and patience so far and hopefully the majority of people end up being happy with your, and the powers that be, choices. I have seen some great posts in this forum and unfortunately I'm not a hard number cruncher so I<BR>can only give an opinion based on my being a 54 Shaman. On the matters of healing. I think adding another heal for the shaman/druids is a great idea in complementing our line of heals to this point. You have already stated that you would make sure that is doesn't overstep onto the Cleric's duties so I'm sure you'll find a happy medium with a new spell.<BR>Pets... the never ending debate.. hehe.. I am a firm believer in the pets to this point and<BR>believe that the 55 pet does need some improvement. I think an increase in level would<BR>be an excellent improvement even if the damage output of the pet was kept around what it was before the recent change. One idea came to mind.. what if the spell cast a consistant level pet. Say x mana for x pet that hit for a maximum of x damage. Personally I'd like to see a 40ish lvl pet and would not mind the 850 mana if I knew it<BR>were to cast x lvl pet everytime. Just a thought.<BR>Fizzle Ratio... I have seen some spells that should be looked over for a high fizzle ratio.<BR>Canna 3 and Rage come to mind as well as Superior Heal. I understand a chance to fizzle comes with casting a higher level spell but the fizzles with these spells seems ridiculous. I've lost 50 percent of my mana attempting to cast Rage at one point, and the "rofl's" from my group was quite embarrassing ;P.<BR>Rage Line... I personally am an AC Shaman and think the Rage line is a great spell and would like to see it stay as is, except for the fizzling. I know this is highly controversial,<BR>and again, this is just my opinion.<BR>Stat Buffs.. from what I can see from the number crunchers, stat buffs and stat effects in general need a hard looking at. I think any elaboration on the effect(s) of stats and buffing would be most helpful from you and your staff.<BR>Spell Drops... It seems some of the higher end spells are to infrequent in their drops. I<BR>believe drops should be hard but not impossible. I understand the reasoning behind the equipment drops but with spells, they should be attainable by all with a little hard work. As it seems now, only a blessed few have the higher end nice spells on all the servers.<BR>Spell Effects.. Only two come to mind at the level I've attained. The first being Spirit Quickening. I have yet to attain this spell but I understand it lasts 5 minutes or so? Great spell, but what was wrong with the original 15 minutes I believe it had in the beginning. Please increase the time duration on this spell. The second spell I have a<BR>question on is Shield of Words. I'm not entirely positive is this spell is shared with another class, I believe it is but I'm not positive, but when I got that spell I was a little disappointed in seeing it had a 2 AC increase with a max of 4 AC which I'm assuming will happen at lvl 56. After the length of time from receiving Guardian until Shield of Words, I was hoping for a higher AC increase in the spell. I understand it lasts a bit longer then Guardian, but I think that a 10 AC increase would have been nice.. especially at that<BR>level where I'm seeing lots of nasties that can't wait to do me bodily injury, hehe.<BR>Again, these are just some ideas and thoughts, any input would be great. I look forward to seeing what the Shaman will be when all is done and over with. Thanks for your time and keep up the hard work.<P>Magikk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>DeaDPooL99 said<P>"SLAM SLAM, blah blah blah, slam lands 1 out of every 10 trys, its kinda nice, but hardly worth bringing up"<P>Actually it is. Our offensive and defensive skill do need to be addressed. I for one thought they would give us the ability to Train Slam (Bash) post 50. THat would have been a huge plus to shaman. THe clerics are wanting this ability atm.<P>Defense (dodge) caps at like 35 skill or something don't know exact number just know it is 3pp or something to train which means it is very low. We actually could use the ability to train 50-80 more points in it since Turg is such a huge agro and SoV mobs hitting for 800 very rarely are we going to dodge.<P><BR>EvilChu Said.<P>Faction: Iksar are KOS by every other playable race.<BR>Quests: Iksar have access to fewer quests than any other race.<BR>Bash: Iksar shamans lack the bash skill and have no way to stun an opponent.<BR>Hitpoints: Iksar have by far the fewest hitpoints of the shaman races.<BR>Strength: Iksar shamans have inconveniently low strength to the point that full banded is a weight management challenge.<P>Ok first....<P>Faction... again you knew this when you made the character. Iksar have some of the best quests in the game beside troll shaman. Ogre shaman have like 3 quests total. Bash...again you knew this when ya made the character. Hitpoints... Cry me a river, get your HP buffs/Stam buffs/ cleric buffs etc. I as an Ogre shaman have only 200hp more than a barb shaman 2 levels higher than me which will raise to 250 at L60. WHy you ask? B/c I have a stam higher than his and I added stam when I made the character so I "would" have some more hp. Stregth you can buff yourself quit whining and cast the damn spell.<P>And yes I do know about Iksar I have a L51 Iksar Necro myself. Do I have a problem with faction? No more than my Ogre shaman had but guess what if you get off your duff you can become friendly with just about every town. My ogre can walk the streets of Qeynos safely. Freeport north the bards view me amiably.

</FONT><HR>Barring any changes to the way stat buffs work, perhaps we would be better off referring to them as "illusion" spells.  After all, any benefit anyone sees from them is primarily illusional.<P>Right now I would put Shaman stat buffs as class defining and as useful as enchanter illusion spells.<P>Fortunaely for enchanters, their illusions didn't prevent them from getting a number of useful spells every level.<P>But for us shaman, our "illusion" spells, instead of being the filler to our spell list, end up taking up most of it.<P>So Verant, I would recommend either making stat buffs meaningful, or compensate us with additional spells for having the majority of our spell arsenal made up with fluff.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I guess a higher level Iksar shaman opinion isn't going to hurt here.<P>1) Iksar shaman DO NOT NEED JB armor. That's a fact. WHY? Well, let's see: <P>1a) troll regen with a higher wis. <P>1b) innate ac bonus = I had near JB shaman using ac with only seb scale crap on. Now that I am obtaining pieces of PoG armor, I am starting to surpass those shaman in ac, and BLOWING them away in wis. At current I have a 1k ac, 2155 hps SELF buffed. Equiped non-buffed ac = 936.<P>2) Shaman spells(as well as every other class of spell caster spells) in the 55+ range are to darn rare. Most often they drop off either: a) juggernaughts and the RARE RARE myconid or b) off the uber mobs in Kunark. Velios spells are a little better, but not by much. Not a problem if you are a uber-guild member like I am, but I hear ALOT of shaman on my server that aren't in a uber-guild complain about this all the time. Not everyone WANTS to be in a uber-guild. /shrug<P>3) Manacosts versus fizzle rates is insane. Ever fizzled Talisman of Kragg? Half a bubble of mana on a 211 wis shaman with high mana/hp giving items like spear of fate, heiro cloak, SW BP, etc gone bye bye. A pet that costs 850 mana and hits for a wopping 47 dmg? Yes, I actually turned on others hits in Kaesora tonight while helping my wife get the gem she needed there for her epic quest. I was perturbed to see the results.<P>4) Stat buffs are fine imo, I sure as hell get bugged enough for them on raids. EVERY tank wants the max buffs they can get.<P>5) Healing? I rarely heal except in emergency situations. This coming from a new split server where high level clerics are few and far between. Fix the fizzle rates on SH and everyone will be happy imo. Fizzling 3 times in a row, losing a bubble of mana while trying to do an emergency heal is perturbing to say the least.<P>6) Why do shamans only get a group scale spell? A group SoW doesn't hurt druids at all, and would save me headaches. Same with a group regrowth. Shaman DO get the base spells before druids afterall, you can't tell me that some wise shaman couldn't come up with a group version in his experimenting somewhere along the way. This is just a time saver issue, not a major issue for me.<P>7) Major issue for me is potions that people actually want. I can count on 1 hand which potions I get asked for alot. 2 fingers to be exact. SoW potions and the occasional shrink potion. Both potions top out in difficulty(read skill raising potential) at a very low level. Something creative would be nice here, alchemy is a wide open door for VI to play with, yet it is lack-luster at best. Oh, and yes an Iksar gate potion would be nice also, say in FoB or Lake of Ill Omen. Herb prices for the duration/effect given per potion are a little high also. How many people pay someone 10pp(average cost per potion in my calculations based on my skill level) for a SoW from someone?<P>8) Spear of Fate effect? I rarely use the effect on my poker. Only time I use it is the very few times I am soloing. Something more useful would have been nice(read a buff or something like chanters and clerics get) but not a big deal. Making it it's own line of DoT(read stacks with all other DoTs) would make it much better as well and I would probably use it more then. As it is now, it is a stat-giving item for me 99% of the time, and a greeny killer.<P>9)Anyone else besides me getting tired of only being a buff vendor at large scale raids? Let's see, other than the 2 obvious debuffs(insidious decay and malo) what the hell else is there for us to do? Let's see, I get to buff, buff, and more buff. Then when the big fight comes, I get to sit and watch other people kill the big nasty instead of having an active hand in the fray. That's fun(sarcasm). Resist rates are insane on some of this stuff. *cough*alldorfsinicewellresisteverything*cough*<P>Just my perspective. /shrug flame away gents.<P>Zukaril Dreadfire &lt;The Harmonium&gt;<BR>level 58 Iksar Luminary of Xev</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Take a look at Iksar Monks.  They also get a higher AC but without the artificial item unavailability.  Iksar shamans have a real need for the higher AC due to the low number of hitpoints.<P>It's actually funny that we're seeing a lot of shaman complaining about how good the cleric armor is compared to the rune etched and jaundiced bone.

</FONT><HR>Here goes another summary of issues that should be important to ALL shaman:<P>* Healing<P>I don't think shaman want to even be close to cleric power when it comes to healing.  They do want to have a level of healing that is sufficient so that the group doesn't have to disband when the cleric calls it a night.  With the current level of healing there are SoV mobs (not dragons or bosses) that I can barely keep the tank alive against chain casting superior healing.  I don't want CHeal or anything close, I just want something viable so that I can assist the cleric or as least be functional in a healing role.  My proposal is the following:<P> -  Move superior healing to level 49.<BR> -  Move the proposed Chloroblast (on test) to level 53 to replace superior healing in the line up.<BR> -  Add a celestial healing type spell at level 56.  I would suggest a spell that does 4 ticks of 180 hp for 200 mana.<BR> -  Keep Torpor as is at level 60.<P>The last two spells have a heal over time characteristic are more fitting with the shaman background (imo).<P>* Stat buffs<P>I am sure we can all agree that we would love stat buffs to be more effective; that their effects would be greatly noticeable.  Unfortunately, I think that such changes would be have such a wide impact on the game that implementing them in a balanced fashion would be a monumental, if not impossible, undertaking.  I think the following considerations would help though:<P> - Mana costs on the level 51+ single target stat buffs should be lowered to 120 (manical stregth should stay at 150 due to the huge duration upgrade).<BR> - The group buffs should have their effects increased to those of the best single target buffs. (Preferred solution)  Another option would be to keep the lower level effects but lower the mana cost to 250.<P>As I commented in an earlier post, both of these changes are consistent with the mana cost progression of the spell line and with the mana ratio other classes have for their group buffs.<P>* Value on high end raids/SoV encounters<P>The above improvements to healing will offer some help for shaman in the high end raid environment.  A couple other small solutions that might help (in order of priority).<BR> <BR> - A lure type attack speed slow down spell.  I would suggest at 25% slow down, level 58, 225 mana, 5 mins duration.<BR> - A small improvement in the resists (chance that mob resists debuff) against the maloxxx line of spells.  I would suggest a 10% improvement for starters.<BR> - SoV added 2 poison DD spells for shaman, one at level 34 and one at level 44.   I would add another at level 54.<P>* Stacking issues<P>Without listing all the stacking issues previously raised, it is clear that their are lots of problems with the stacking of high end shaman spells.  I would be helpful if at least the issues with Avatar-Focus of the Spirit-Rage line could be addressed.<P>* The pet<P>The biggest concern here is the enormous mana cost increase.  Lowering the mana cost by 200 would be a good start.  Some have suggested adding a second pet at level 59.  I don't know if this is truly needed.  How many shaman at level 59 use a pet in a group environment?<P>I think these are the big five issues that could really impact ALL shaman.  If there are any issues that could use attention, these are them.  Now there are alot of other issues, but they are either not universal (affect only soling efficiency, affect only one race, are trivial after a certain level) or not particularly impactful (alchemy, shrink outdoors).  I think it would be for all shaman if we stay focus on these core items and present suggestions that have reasoned support.<P>Dwilgar<BR>Luminary of Rallos Zek<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor:<P>ITEM: Torpor.<P>it currently already stacks with regrowth.. has since last patch. im thankful this change occured however this spell still have 1 major problem in my opinion: its stacking issues. fix this problem and this will be an awesome, balancing spell. shamans who understand their class will not ask for another healing upgrade after this suggested upgrade: make it so that a 60 shaman will NEVER get the message 'your spell did not take hold' when casting torpor. this feature of our spell forces shamans to keep memmed and use the much inferior, fizzling, inefficient healing spell superior healing.<P>as far as i can, torpor will not take hold if any of the following are true:<P>1) player has a slow spell on them, either from an ENC or SHM mob/player<BR>2) player has recently been resurrected (slow component of ressurection effects doesn't stack with torpor's slow component is my guess)<BR>3) player has full buffs and no available buff slots<BR>4) player is under the effects of certain dots<P><BR>as for the snare component of torpor forcing it to be group only.. ofcourse having it be non group only would be wonderful, and i approve of getting rid of the snare component in favor of some other drawback (be it higher mana cost, increased % slow on target etc). but i think the worst problem with it is currently the shaman caster currently has to guess as to wiether or not the spell will even take hold. a couple times when i was playing primary healer, my group died because torpor wouldn't work. and i dont think ANY of the instances i listed that torpor wont work are reasonable and justified.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It's been said by others, but the problem wiht our "issues" list is that is misses the most fundamental point that was consistently raised throughout the discussion. The effectiveness of our PRIMARY ability (buffing) is debatable at low levels and almost nil in the post-50 world.<P>This is because of stat caps (how many warriors at 50 have the headroom for the 67 strength provided by our 49 spell?), diminishing returns on stats over 200, and (to a very small degree) poorly conceived group buffs.<P>The question remains: even if you addressed every single issue in the list as given by Absor, why would any 51+ group choose a shaman to fill one of their six slots?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Turgur's alone (until enchanters get slow upgrade at 57) is reason alone to take a shaman in a 6 person group.  Does it make shaman as "valuable" as clerics or melee (rogues, warriors, monks)?  Probably not; but that is a fundamental design direction of the game that a few (if even somewhat major) tweaks to class balance isn't going to fix.<P>Dwilgar<BR>Luminary of Rallos Zek<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Several people are complaining about the laughable PoS items (appropriately named IMO) for Shamen.<P>I don't see a problem here.  The Plane is designed to be extremely expensive to get to and progress through.<P>The Stein of Flowing Ichor is *vastly* less likely to go in my hand over the Charred Guardian Shield that has been in it for the last 30 levels.<BR>If it were *twice* as good, it still wouldn't be worth the loss of AC.<P>As for the quest items, they so far seem to suck.  A few have charged parlor tricks, such as the items with 2 charges of Feign Death, but I will not be spending many thousands of platinum on various keys and several months of my life gathering rare drop components just to get that item that I can use all of twice and then throw in my bank to rot.<P>For me, the fact that we don't have to go there ends up in the plus column...<P>I feel bad for the classes that have to go their for their Epics.  There are some useful items up there, but not for our class, so screw it, it goes on my list of useless zones I have ZERO interest in exploring.  I will go up there only if needed by a friend or guildmate, which is unlikely as I have never seen a place where a Shaman is actually *needed.*<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The increase in heal is only slightly warrented with shaman.  I helped clear Fear a while back and we did it with one cleric and the rest of the healers were druids and shaman, we did it with mid 50s types and high 40s and there was a total of 22 players.  A shaman and a druid did a BETTER job than a single cleric on heals, plus we contributed dots that made us kill steal the more tank heavey groups.  I really don't get the focus on healing.  The warriors didn't like getting healed with 2k HP left, but they can adjust.  And with shaman regen heh I think people that think shamans can't heal are jsut ignorant of the class or play with shaman that don't know how to play the class.  My slow negates more damage than a cleric can using CH heh.<BR>Focus on alchemy, armor, etc.  Basically shaman are about right though.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 8 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000396-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000396.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000396-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000396-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000396-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000396-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000396-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum14/HTML/000396-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum14&number=14&thisthread=000396&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum14&number=14&thisthread=000396&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
