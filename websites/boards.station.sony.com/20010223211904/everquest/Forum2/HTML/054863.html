And it is not comedic in the least. Today on the boards I read a thread 636 posts long by Elementalist925. I encourage you to look it up if it can still be found.<P>Elementalist has played since beta, his wife just recently joined in April of 2000. She created a character named Managirl Beachbum because she loved oasis. I won't word it in the way Elementalist did since I want to keep to the facts here, but suffice to say she had fun, as all players do. One day she got "the call" and a GM popped in and told her she was in violation of the naming policy. Managirl asked why, not knowing what it was. 5 minutes later Managirl Beachbum became Named Matemp.<P>The real person behind Managirl started crying after that, and Elementalist wrote that post to say that he and his wife were leaving.<P>Those were the facts. And that's sad.<P>It's one thing to blame guides. Guides are just normal players whose hands are tied by Verant's policy. They don't get paid and they get upset and tired and cranky like anyone else. It's another issue when a GM, a Verant employee is involved.<P>Were something like this done by a guide and there were 600 posts on the board, Verant would likely change it immeadiatly. But since this was a GM, and Verant has to speak in a unified voice, it's unlikely things are going to change, and often they don't.<P>It all goes back to Verant's marketing hook-phrase:<P>"You're in our world now."<P>Which *is* a good line, but it's not true. It was never true, and it never will be. Verant doesn't own this world. But they like to flex by saying they own the "intellectual copyrights" to the software, which I suppose is okay if they use it correctly.<P>Like shutting down E-Bay, I can support that.<P>But removing the account of a writer on an unofficial board because of their fan fiction, that I can't support much at all.<P>And hurting the person-behind-the-person because of some stupid, arbitrary policy, that won't be supported by anyone.<P>These are all symptoms of "You're in our world now."<P>But we're not, because you own exactly what you say you do, intellectual copyrights. *We*, the players, own this world. It's always been our world, we just let you play around with it like the miniature Bristlebanes you are.<P>Just like the hackers trying to create a hacked copy of EQ, you seem to have somewhere missed the point. It's because of us that Nerissa Clothspinner, who walks daily into the fields outside Qeynos, will someday find her sister. Or that thought that maybe, just maybe, I can succeed where Magi'kot failed.<P>I know most of you can remember Everquest when it first started. It took 40 people to take down the Sand Giants in oasis at level 20, because higher levels were so scarce. We'd lose 15 people for one giant. The people who lead those meaningless attacks now lead the most powerful guilds in Norrath. And every now and then a high level would show up and clear the giants and we'd all be greatful, and they'd be happy to help. /wave to Ariannah DeLaLunas<P>It's the interplay between Omani/PR/Divine and Prophecy (Yes, I like many Prophecy people, and I'm level 56, you got a problem with me?) that adds a daily kick to my online life. Or seeing friends get married at Spectre Tower just because two Ogres can't get to Erollisi's Temple.<P>Everquest's world isn't frogs or trolls, and it's citizens aren't found in the Firiona Vie outpost or Highpass Hold (That poor Highpass has been under seige for so long now), but in The Safehouse and the Magician's Tower, or at The Casters Realm.<P>I've seen true Rogues who have spoken proudly of their class even when it sucked, I see Rangers who do it now despite my teasings.<P>I've watched Fires of Heaven, Legacy of Steel, and Afterlife go higher and farther than anyone else, and I still pity them.<P>And my latest hobby is scaring the level 26's with my Cyclops pet, while waiting for the Shy Horse to spread her wings.<P>And you have the ego to say it's your world.<P>I hope this story gets posted on Bertox Hall like my last one, and then I hope it's posted in The Safehouse and on Caster's Realm and Everlore and I hope Computer Gaming World does an article on it. I hope that maybe you'd do the right thing and let Managirl Beachbum have her name back.<P>Maybe Brad would call them and apoligize. But then again, I'm young (only 18) and idealistic.<P>I'm not going to threaten leaving, because I wouldn't leave. And I won't say another word because writing is what I do and I've done it. But I wish you all the bad press and lost profits in the world while you continue to do this. You've broken one of the cardinal rules of entertainment and hurt one of your fans.<P>Deelit begins to cast a spell.<BR>Deelit attempts to summon someone who gives a d***<P>Deelit Elementalcaller<BR>56 Magician of Erollisi Marr<BR>Divine, Bertox</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have always thought the name nazis at Verant needed taking down a peg. They didn't have the nerve to say anything about the troll warrior I named Aradunce...in fact most GMs who saw it laughed. If that isn't a name that begged to be changed, a direct insult to Verant's CEO or whatever Brad McQuaid's mismanagement title might be, then I don't know what is. I don't disagree that people with obscene or blatantly d00d1sh names should have them changed. But I do know that people who are just having fun should be left alone. Especially if the name describes the character, such as my dwarf cleric's does. Galavant Greenlabel, traveling cleric and master brewer, at your service. Names mean a lot to a character. They mean what people know you by, what they know about you, your reputation and all that. Imagine how many online friends got lost when that player had her name changed, simply because now they don't know who to look for. Changing a name is not a punishment in most cases that I have seen. Unfortunately, it's usually a case of cruelty and orneriness on the part of some GM who's having a bad day. Aradune, I hope you read this, because I think it's time Aradunce made another appearance and reminded the world of what Verant "management" is actually about. Nuff said.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You are a very gifted writer of comedy.  That is the funniest thing that I have seen in weeks.  I, too, feel like the Managirl situation was wrong.  However, Verant and the powers that be don't really care about how we feel or say as long as they get paid.

</FONT><HR>The point that you are missing is that managirl is not offensive at all, GM's should be rational, like any game master for an RPG.  They should have the decency to say "gee managirl is not really offensive at all".  Instead they read from scripts like trained monkeys.  following their strict "polocies".  These issues are related in that this behavior from Verant will likely displease many EQ gamers, and if Verant loses it's players, the online community of EQ becomes and online ghost town.  Therefore it is OUR world, the players could destroy it or make it prosper.

</FONT><HR>I enjoy these little stories you write. I read the other previous ones too. Only thing I didn't like about this one is the "Groller Stroking" has even made it's way to your stories.<P>I'm not anti-Groller, I enjoy his posts. I'm just anti-high school popularity system. I've read plenty of posts by others that happen to NOT be Groller that were as funny, as interesting, if not sometimes more so. Where's the posts and replies praising them? No where. They don't get any recognition while Groller gets more ego stroking every week.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif"><P>But over all, funny post. Even though that type of humor reminds me of Gamer Geek Humor. Ain't nothing wrong with that though. Unless of course the gamer is smelling up your GenCon booth.<P>As far as Managirl Beachbum goes. Yeah, that name while violating the naming policy....was not hurting anyone.  If I was a GM that happen to spot it, I would've just shrugged and kept walking by.<P>However, it's just a game. We shouldn't have to feel sorry for anyone who wasn't mature enough to handle that situation. I've heard others but a bit of blame on the Husband too. For he didn't warn her about the Naming Policy. I'd put more on her, for she obviously didn't READ the naming policy. Or if she did, she ignored it.<P>People get all bent out of shape when they don't get to have their cute little names. The game tells you right up front you can't have them. It goes along with all the other rules that come when you buy the game. Once you know the playing field and it's rules, it's easy to enjoy the rest of the game. <P>To make the Naming Policy a little easier to comprehend to those who still don't understand what is okay and what isn't.<P>When you name your character, think to yourself, if I was an author of a serious fantasy novel (not Xanth or some parody, I mean serious) would I use this name in my book? If the answer is no, then it's against the policy.<P>Imagine this:<P>    There were many Bagginses and Boffins, and also many Tooks and Brandybucks; there were various Grubbs (relations of Bilbo Baggins' grandmother), and various Chubbs (connexions of his Took grandfather), and a selection of Burrowses, Bolgers Bracegirdles, Brockhouses, Goodbodies, Hornblowers, Proudfoots and let's not forget Porterguy Sowgiver of the Sowgivers from the Westfarthing.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The naming policy confuses me. They don't want us to use names that detract from the fantasy atmosphere they claim the game has, but have no qualms about using wierd, non-fantasy , plagerized celebrity names, and the such for npcs. Just look at the names of npcs as you travel around. Seems to me the alot of the names they use detract from the fantasy atmosphere they claim the naming policy protects just as much or more than some player names I seen. In fact, if we used some of those npc names for our players they would no doubt change them like they did the Beachbum name, and for the same reason. But they write the code, so it is do 'as I say and not as I do'.<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Okay, this was the funniest post I've ever read.<P>The story was hilarious.  Even though I'm not of uber-status and have yet to really see anyone demonstrate the class stereotypes you harped upon, I got a few good laughs from it.<P>What was even more funny is your feelings (as well as the feelings of those who replied) on the Managirl subject.  Managirl Beachbum.  That name is so stupid.  The stripping of her name had nothing to do with Verant being "nazis" or a guide being in a bad mood.  THAT NAME IS JUST STUPID.<P>This isn't a flame.  I'm just in disbelief that so many people would be supporting a name like this.  If I had a character who I had put many hours into, and I realized that his name was stupid, I would be thankful to have the GMs change it to something more sensible for me.  Her name (if she can get over the sheer RL emotional distress of the name change and continue playing) will not be "Matemp" forever.  Once she's regained her composure and is able to think of a decent name, it will be hers.<P>Instead of supporting a name like "Managirl" and wasting up valuable board space, we should be collaborating to help find a good name for this distraught person.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The truth is, I have seen both games where the admins catered completely to the players, and gamers where the admins were control gods way worse than the EQ GM's are.  Ever heard of a game where the GM banned you for talking back? I have.  Not only have I, but I've known hundreds literally thousands of players who play that game and abide by those rules and when you've done that, you can see EQ's situation in a completely new light.<P>First of all, EQ is nothing without the players OR the creators.  Without the players, EQ is just an empty software, a bunch of pic files, and some music score.  Without the people who maintain it, EQ is just a dream that exists in people's heads but does not realize itself.  Neither complete democracy nor utter order works.  Those are the facts.<P>That is why one must not look at the game and see the players as being the end all do all.  They are not.  I'll tell you what happens when players rule: we get the Mob.  That's why society cannot properly function without leaders or rules or governments.  In a situation like so, all society would be is the interest of the majority, and the majority is not always right.  Far from it.  The majority, when in a state of hysteria as they often are when some nerf or enhancements hit another class, DO NOT think straight.  Most of the posts here should tell you that much.<P>That is why we must have governments and rules.  To protect the minority from the majority.  Fourteen classes are in EQ.  Do you really think anyone of them gives a damn if necromancers or druids stopped existing as a class? I doubt it.  Nobody cares about a class he or she does not intend to play.  Verant here acts as the mediator.  They balance the interests of one class with that of another, and maintains order, which they call the Vision(tm).  Granted, Verant is sometimes wrong, but that does not mean that they are needed any less.  Their existence, the existence of the GM's, and the mere fact that a government does exist within EQ maintains its existence.  Without Verant, EQ would degenerate into a haven for hackers and cheaters in a matter of weeks and monthes.  Many of us saw what happened to Diablo without that much needed government.  Players cannot be depended on for honest play because frankly, the honest players leave when the game play goes bad.<P>In the situation of naming, Verant again acts as the force of order in an otherwise chaotic world.  They claim they champion the cause of roleplayers, but in truth who roleplays in EQ? Not many people that I know.  Yet we are nevertheless helped by the naming policy, because most of us do not want to see names like UberDewd001 or ThePimpDaddy in the game.  Those names detract from our gaming experience.  Sure, this isn't a roleplaying game, but we at least want to pretend sometimes that it is.  We at least want some simblance of order and security, because there are always those out there bent on disruption.  While it is true that the majority of a society are seldom jerks, those few jerks that do exist can often ruin a society - and it shows.<P>So Verant's maintenance of a naming policy is not the problem here.  That is not and should not be the issue of discussion.  A naming policy must exist if EQ is to maintain what integrity it has left as a fantasy, roleplaying game.  Now how far that naming policy goes is and how it is implemented another issue, and one not suited for discussion in this thread.  Do I support the name Managirl Beachbum? I highly doubt that I would.  Yet Order is not dictated by one's opinions.  There's alot of things I do not care about in Everquest and in the Realworld, and that is because I am a human being and I have biases and opinions.  I am not perfect, and that is why society must provide government and Order.  Order to sketch a line between the interests of the majority and the interests of the minority.  Order to keep at bay personal opinions and hysteria.  Order to form the best agreement between different groups.  That is what Verant should be doing, and by arbitrarily changing Managirl's name without decent explanation or communication with the player, they proved that they aren't doing this.  <P>The bottom line is pretty simple.  We should not be questioning the need for order, as I've seen many people do.  That is hardly the question here.  Order must exists, for society without order is Anarchy.  Society without order is not freedom, because in promoting the freedom of one you often supplant that of another.  The question here is one of Verant's implementations of that order.  For though the lack of order is anarchy, it is no better than the complete dominance of order: tyranny.<BR>    </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
