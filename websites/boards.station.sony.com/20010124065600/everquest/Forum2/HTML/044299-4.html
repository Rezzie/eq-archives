</FONT><HR>Note:  Very limited time to read all the posts here, so this may have already been touched on.<P>My biggest complaint with the "role" of a necromancer on a large raid is not her usefulness.  In a pinch, necros are always nice to have to supplement your enchanters and clerics with mana.  <P>HOWEVER<P>It seems the necromancer is the only class that is forced to completely reverse their playing styles from small grouping to large group raids.  You made a true statement in saying that clerics excel at "mana to hps" while necromancers excel at "hps to mana".  The GIGANTIC difference being that a cleric knew about, accepted, and has fit into this role from the very beginning!<P>From the very start a cleric comes to know his role in groups, big or small, as <P>1. Heal<BR>2. Buff<BR>3. Stun<P>These are things that remain constant when grouping for orc camps at level 9, or when invading Old Sebilis at level 60.  All we are asking is to give the necromancer the ability to do the things she loves and has exceled at for 50 levels!  Name one other class that is forced to radically change their roles as the necromancer.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>Clerics heal, warriors tank, monks pull, rogues deal melee damage, wizards deal magic damage, enchanters crowd control...these roles are defined early in the classes' careers, and while they morph slightly as the levels change, for the most part these are the things they are called upon to perform.<P>What do you think clerics would say if in the post-50 game their ability to heal become useless/unwanted and were forced to use their stuns and limited DDs instead?  Could they still be of use in large raids or groups?  Yes, but they no longer would be using the skills and abilities they had honed for 50 odd levels.<P>Or what if enchanters suddenly were unable to land mezzes or stuns on 95% of the post-50 creatures?  Now they are reduced to handing out Clarity and using their inefficient DDs to back up wizards?  Again I ask, would there be use for the enchanter in a group?  Aye indeed, but once again they would be tossing out their known and practiced skills of 50 levels.<P>Could someone enlighten me why necromancers should then be quiet and accept their soloing-crippled, nothing-but-a-mana-pump, post-50 transformation?   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ah heck..<BR>Isn't it easy to understand that if people playing necromancers wanted to give mana to others, they'd be playing an enchanter rather? If they wanted to heal others they'd play a cleric. Well they didn't, because that's not the role they wanted to play. How about Verant stops shoving their ideas down our throats? Sure, it's their gam.. no wait, we're the one paying for this game to go on, so we should have the right to get OUR opinion defended.<P>Absor's starting to sound like Abashi.

I take lvl 50necro mana 2000/(cost of spell) 300 = 6.667 or 6 mana dumps. 6 mana dumps giving 100 mana/dump  = 600mana. Cleric CH costs 400mana. This makes full necro mana dump  = 1 CH. Now for level 60 necro its the same. 3000/400(assuming lvl 56 spell) = 7.5 or 7 mana dumps(giving 150m a dump) giving the cleric 1050 mana, or 2 CH.<P>So, Absor, our very useful role in big raids is to give 1 cleric 1 CH in 33 seconds(assuming the necro is 56+, or 44 seconds if lvl 44-55) and under good conditions (no fizzles, etc). <P>Should we say thank you?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>lordzemus-<BR>It seems to me you're just crappy necros...<BR>This nonsense of getting yelled at by enchanters for having your pet up? Poor pet control. I assume you have pet attack and pet back off hotkeys, and an assist key? And the damage output on the rogue pet and especially the monk pet (not 59 yet, so can't comment there) is a definite addition. Combined with backup mes (yes folks, ST does work, I've done crowd control to the kitchen in Seb and other nasty places), mana transfer, self-healing...<P>And where the hell are you people getting resisted? The only things that resist my taps are uber mobs with AEs... and let's think about why!<P>Let's say the queen in Chardok. If I could cast and hit deflux on her in between AE waves, I'd never die, and never aggro her. So why bring wizards at all at that point? Bring a couple necros, and have them tap her silly while magician fire pets attack her!<P>But let's face it. Yes there is a drawback to our soloing power, and you can't complain of it. First off, having a necromancer or two on a raid is a good safety net. Do you know anyone else who can fd and res? And yes, your guildmates will be willing to let you sacrifice some secondaries once they notice you're the only one left at wipeouts. Cleric or wizard used too much mana? Pump them. Enchanter getting pummeled by a mob? ST, turn your pet's taunt back on (you do leave it off for raids, don't you?) and send it, or cast anything out of the Heart Flutter line, guaranteed to make the mob want to eat you.  Throw a shadowbound out to save that tank, because Bond of Death and Deflux WILL hit every mob except the last one, despite these asinine complaints. Oh, and your DoTs do hit. Try using the right ones.<P>It's yet another thread of complaining on these boards, but sadly, it's my class this time. I've been playing since release, and while I don't know of the beta power of necros, I've seen every "nerf" to come our way... and frankly, I still feel like the most powerful class in the game, and cannot bring myself to truly play any twink I start, because it's just not the same. Nothing compares to the diversity, flexibility, and outright power of a well-played necromancer. I don't have any problems getting groups, and neither should you.<P>we are not talking about the regular encounters.  if you knew how to read maybe you could see we are talking about the high lvl encounters like dragons/gods/etc. <BR>ST- not needed there<BR>dots- none will land!<BR>lifetaps-ditto<BR>pact of shadow- well you can transfer your hp to someone else but then your going to have no way to get it back.<BR>res- dont even bring up the res, also if your guild is not bright enough to have a cleric camp if you are getting slaughtered then..<BR>btw get over the whole ego trip thing with you thinking every single person posting here is a 'crappy' necro.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>  The "death" of necromancers at high levels is because all pure casters (the 4 of them) except enchanters are damage dealing classes.  The simple fact of the matter is that before verant raised the total hp of mobs over 32k they had to find ways to make mobs harder.  Well upping resists and ac of the mobs and giving them insane ae's was how they made trak a challenge to us post Kunark.  Nag and Vox strength dragons had just gotten too easy overall bc anyone that had ice spells could generally do damage.  <BR>  Wizards, Necromancers, and Magicians are 3 of the strongest damage dealing classes in the game.  They should all be able to damage the uber mobs in the game bc that is their function at any form of attack in the game.  <BR>  I still believe that the way the drain was originally in the game (unresistable) is the way it should be AT THE VERY LEAST FOR 50 TO 60 NECROMANCERS, so they can still perform their role.  YES IT IS OUR ROLE TO DAMAGE MOBS, NOT FEED MANA.  <BR>  Absor let me explain something to you.  In killing uber mobs that have these extremely powerful ae's the hardest part of slaying these mobs is surviving the lag.  Every person there on that raid causes more lag.  The key is not always more people bc your servers (and believe me it is NOT me anymore, I have cable and have a great connection) arent capable of supporting so many ppl in such close proximity.  If you want to say it's our machines that cant handle it fine, the game should be designed for player's best interest and enjoyment.  Your minimum specifications should be all that is necessary to play this game but if you want to survive a trakanon raid from linkdeath alone dont expect to w/ only minimum requirements.<BR>  My suggestion to help out necromancers is to start between 50 and 60 w/ a curve of less resistance for the lifetaps.  At level 60 our poor ratio lifetaps should be able to damage anything for at least partial damage.  <BR>  I have a level 60 necromancer on the Rathe.  I have played through all of your nerfs.  I enjoy my class because through it all I was able to perform my function of damage dealer on everything prekunark except the 2 dragons.  Necromancers have a far lower proportional power at 60 than at 50.  What that means is at 50 my peers viewed me as more powerful in comparison to the game and to them than they do at 60.  I dont even concern myself w/ that as much bc maybe things are more balanced now.  What does concern me is that Ive spent 152 days playing this character that is virtually useless on large scale raids.  The point we are all making is that as magicians, necromancers, and wizards we want to damage the mobs the way we are designed to.  If you suddenly made melee damage resistable somehow you would alienate a larger percentage of the playerbase but since it's just necromancers and mages oh well.  Wizards got their lures post 50 and deserve to be more useful on raids than us.  This does not mean we should be useless though.  <BR>  All we are asking is to be useful.  I have the friends to do all the large raids I want.  Walk a mile in a level 60 necromancers shoes and see how unfulfilling it is on various levels and maybe you would sympathize.  <BR>  The ultimate bottom line for verant is this.  The people that feel wronged in this game wont ever buy another verant product.  As much as I love everquest verant treats the playerbase grossly unfair in so many ways bc the money making machine is making it's money so why fix what they think isnt broke.

So doesnt Verant's past logic totally invalidate your comparison to clerics?<P>We didnt ask you to explain our role but should any class be made impotent?  The Necro class has gone from an offensive class to be feared to a really bad manabattery status NOT required for raids.  Doesnt this seem unlogical?  You state we have a lot of things we bring to raids - that implys more than one yet all you cited for example is being a mana battery.  Besides DMF or SC what are all those other many things?  Surely not this many 50+ necros have failed to discover the "many things" we can do on uber raids?<P>In addition, to high level necros calling it quits or playing twinks, what about guilds limiting the number of necros on raids?<P>Necros should be mostly self sufficient; my guild use to love haveing me come along because they new I could take care of myself in a fight saving the clerics valuable mana.  Now on uber raids they ask can you bring one of your other charaters, and just camp the necro at the zone in case!  Without lifetap much of the necros vaunted power just collapses!

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Your comparison of necros to clerics is faulty for one simple reason.  Clerics start a cleric knowing that their main function will be to heal.  A cleric's role NEVER changes.  When a player starts a necro they have no idea that their only function in the endgame will be to feed mana to other players.   It's a sobering lesson to learn after playing the first 50-55 levels in a completely different manner. <BR>I don't mind being weaker post-50  but we are the only class that has their role completely change post-50.   <BR>Just some thoughts...  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, so you're complaining because you don't think you can do very much, if any damage on a big raid.  Wanna take a guess on how much damage an enchanter does?  How about, say, a Shaman?  Or a Cleric?  In a raid situation, you're right, necros are not damagers.  But as much as people love clarity two, a necromancer can recharge mana a lot faster than an enchanter giving out clarity two.  Enchanters have Debuffs you say?  Please!  My debuffs get resisted 50% of the time on blues and greens AFTER Tashania.  I don't stand a chance with reds.  Sure, I can give out haste... and you have a pet.  <P>Any enchanter that yells at you for having a pet on a raid is a moron.  In fact, I'm an enchanter and I always have a pet on raids... charmed of course.  You just have to learn to keep a tighter leash on your pet... yes, it is possible to call off your pet when it's chasing after something.<P>Oh but you're right about lifetap... maybe we should make it unresistable like it used to be so you really CAN solo in Veeshan's Peak (being sarchastic here, just so you know).  I mean, after all, I've only seen a lifetap get resisted once, and that was on a Trakanon raid... but the other 5 went through just fine.  But that was according to our level 56 necro... maybe he's not a good source.<P>Just out of curiosity, how do YOU define resist?  Are you talking about it doing 200 dmg instead of 900 or whatever it's supposed to do?  You DO know you have two lines of damage spells (not counting wards) that check against two different resists, don't you?  Just makin' sure, because enchanters don't have any non-magic based spells... and all of the spells except the DoT's (which are by far the least damaging of all the casters) are all or nothing spells.  No partial resists for us.<P>Next time you wanna whine because you can't hurt something the way you want to, think about those classes that can't hurt something the only way that's possible for them?  I mean, you wanna see a completely pacifistic class for raids, an enchanter is about as good as it gets.  We don't even have to SEE what we're fighting to do our job... it's that sad.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan, the mana transfer rate on the necro spells are horrible at best, and the recast times on them and the piddly ammount of mana they give is negliable.<P>Also, for these spells to be the most efficent in a situation, the necromancer needs a fast way to regain mana (lich), however, due to the fact that they can not life tap these monsters they have no way to get health back, aside from heals from the cleric, which is just then spending the mana on the necro to get more mana, see the cycle here?<P>Why would you add a necro for a mana-pump, when you could just add another cleric? or another caster?<P>*possibly*, if necromancers got a 2:1 mana-transfer that did a large ammount at once, (say 800 mana to give 400 mana), then things would become a bit better.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alan, I just want to say one thing. You are mistaken. Sure, Necro can convert HP to Mana .. and then give it to other players. And Clerics convert Mana to HP for other players, there is one thing you missed.<P>It's not *efficient* for a Necro to do the *mana battery* role. Costs 200mana to give them only 60 mana? <BR>Where this cost for clerics is 60mana for 100hp.<P>This is not a valid comparison!<P>If you want to make Necros a Mana battery of that nature, fix the ratios!<P>That's why they do NOT do the mana give like you imply. Not cause they are not use to us, it's cause it's totally inefficient for them to. Only a fool would play this role as a necro. They just CAN'T.<P>Here's another example:<BR>Cleric use of 150mana to convert to 300 HP .. wow, awesome conversion ratio.<BR>Necro's finally mana give spell is 300 to only 100 mana. That's not even enough for the Cleric to heal you back.<P>Their Mana to HP conversion is so efficient, it's became their role.<BR>On the other Hand, the Necro's Mana give is so inefficient, they just can't play that role while in a raid. Let and ENC or BRD do that, must for *efficient*!<P>(tip - key word here is efficient .. key to raiding is efficiency .. Not what roles one can play)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, <P>True, there's much more to a raid than fighting the ubermob, and getting there has the competent necro working his ass off helping everyone with root / mez / dot / DD / secondary heal /pet attacks / mana transfer / etc...  That's the fun part of being a necro, actually.<P>But the point of the thread is about that final fight itself.  The original poster (and several that did follow ups) are quite right, I didn't create a necro so that I could be everyone else's inneficient mana battery on the last fight!  But that's exactly the role Verant forced me into.  Everything I cast is resisted and the pet is feared or dies in a few seconds of AE spell effect.  So what's that precious other roles we have then, hmmm?<P>Think of it this way: without that LATE addition to the necro spell repertoire (the mana transfer spell), our class was going to be totally useless on the Kunark ubermobs.  We've been forced in a afterthought role we didn't want, and you're trying to tell us it's "working as intended"?  Thanks for nothing.<P>I wish they'd make out pets immune to fear at least (like a mindless undead should be!).  Maybe use the owner's resistances for the pet?  Or else lower the ubermob resistances now that they can have more than 32k HPs.  This way we necros could at least DoT them and make a contribution to the fight that is in keeping with the original PURPOSE of the necromancer.<P>Aerik N'Krosis<BR>Necromancer 55<BR>The Nameless  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>They say that Necros pay the price of being able to solo to 50, and that price is reduced usefullness in groups.  I think, though, this is a price many bring on themselves.<P>They say the first part is that they're not as powerful:  Maybe so.  But if you can solo to 50, losing some of that ability after 50 is suprising, but not entirely unexpected.  That's the first part of the price, and IMO, the smallest by far:  The lack of power.<P>If you never group, you never learn how to.  I knew a guy who solo'd himself to 35, and when we tried to group, it failed miserably.  He wanted us to adapt to how he solo'd, not to learn how to work in a group.  I know that's not a universal for Necros or Druids, but it's a too-common one.  By 35, if you don't know how to group, you're a liability in a group.<P>That's one part of the price; lack of knowledge.  And since knowledge is power, that's where much of that "lack of power" comes in.<P>The third, and perhaps most vital, part, though, is that you don't make friends.  You have no connections.  At least none who like you and know you well enough to take you on heavy raids.  Ever seen one loose cannon ruin a 30 person raid?  I have.  Trust me, it's not a pretty sight.  If you choose to solo your way to 50, be prepared to be left alone after that--no one, including me, wants to take someone into The Hole or Hate with them if I don't feel confident in their grouping ability.<P>And if you're 50 and I'm not confident in your grouping ability, I am not going to take the time to teach you.  You had 50 levels to learn.  You made the bed.<P>If you want to solo to 50, by all means, do it.  More power to you.  But don't be suprised at what lays in store, please--or at least look at the logic behind it and don't complain needlessly.  Personally, I like grouping with Necromancers and find skilled ones an asset to any group, so I'd ask that you *do* group regularly as you rise up.  The more you group, too... The more you'll realize just how helpful you can be beyond being a mana battery.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If your spells are resisted 100%, then it's not a problem of being a necro, it's a problem of your whole group being too stupid to figure out how to properly debuff a mob.  I know for a FACT that my enchanter spells are more resistable than your necro spells, with perhaps the exception of your resist debuff series.  You complain that you're only good for one or two things?  Well ok... what can I do on a raid... let's see.  I can give out clarity and haste... well, yeah, that's pretty much it.  Maybe when we go kill Trakanon the level 60 enchanters (which I'm not yet) can charm a Jugg for the fight... that makes them pretty effective I suppose... at least until charm breaks.  But it's worked well in the past.  And like I said before, if you're doing a raid on a single mob, like trakanon, or VS, or Gorenaire or somethin, no one in their right mind is gonna complain about you using a pet, because your pet isn't gonna pull anything that the tanks gettin feared to god knows where wouldn't pull.  On Chardok raids where you're constantly moving, yeah I can see why you wouldn't want to have a pet then... but then again if my enchanter can hit things in chardok, your necro can.  <P>My question at this point is: are you really a high level, or are you just going on what you heard other high levels complaining about and exaggerating it more?  NONE of the necros I know seem to have your problem to the degree you discribe, so that leaves me with two choices.  Either you're not high level and you're talking as if you are, or you're just a REALLY crappy necro.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>As someone who's lead a few raids... I have to agree with the opening statement, that necros are pretty crappy on raids.<P>I don't think there is 1 necro out there that started their class with the intent to go on raids and be a mana battery. Yes, not 1.  Enchanters expect to mez stuff. Clerics to heal, wars to tank, rogues to backstab, rangers to suck, wizards to nuke, etc. Necros expect to dot stuff and dump their pet on mobs... but oddly enough, they can't really do that very well any more.  They can't use pets due to buggy pathing in most of the planes. Their dots aren't all that useful due to mobs dying fast or getting mezzed. <P>To verant's "Necros are there to be mana batteries, that's our vision for the class", why oh why in gods name would we bring a NECRO along to give a cleric mana, when WE CAN GET ANOTHER CLERIC!!!!! <P>The only REAL need of a necro on a raid is honestly to summon corpses. And that's why there is usually only 1-2 necros if that. : P<P>-Tav<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>By the way, while we're on the subject... yes, to people who can't see beyond their own wants and desires, it looks like Verant is just out to screw you over.  But believe it or not, you can't have everything your way.  Otherwise, my enchanter would be able to charm as many things as he wanted and wipe out Veeshan's Peak (because, you know, there wouldn't be any level cap on charm either) all by himself, with the help of his newfound dragon army, of course.<P>It is essential in a game like this not to unbalance the choices.  Every class has cool things they can do, as well as drawbacks.  For instance, rogues are by far the most damaging melee class.  However, they have to be behind the target to do so.  If they are in front and getting hit on, they become rangers with worse weapons, less hps, and no spells.<P>With warriors, they have lots of hps, more Armor absorbtion AC than any other class, and the second best weapons of any class.  The downside, of course, is that they have no method of escape if they're in trouble.  No evade, no gate, they can't even jump off of cliffs to get away like I can with my rogue because they don't have safe fall.<P>Necros are the ultimate escape artists.... they have fear, short duration mes, root, and Feign Death.  They have a pet that is almost equal to a warrior (well, a warrior with crappy weapons anyway), the ability to increase the strength, attack speed, AC, and hps of that pet, and the ability to heal their pet and themselves.  If their pet doesn't kill it first, or if the mob doesn't kill them first, they can stack over 8000 dmg worth of DoT's on a mob for less than half of their mana (going by an erudite necro with 200 int and 400 in mana items).  They have self only versions of clarity that are better than anything an enchanter can cast, yet take health... but since you can heal up from 2 bubbles of health with a single lifetap at higher levels, I don't see that as a problem.  You have a snare DoT which lasts a pretty respectable amount of time, damage sheilds, damage absorbtion sheilds, anti undead nukes, undead charms.  You take the strengths of most caster classes and use them for your own benefit.  Of course, the problem is that you ONLY use them for your own benefit.  There are very few spells in a necro's book which can be used on others.  But, truth be told, I like having a necro in a normal group (as opposed to a raid group) more than I like having a wizard.  Sure wizards are nice, but Necros don't have the downtime that wizards do.<P>See, everyone has pluses and minuses.  And everyones pluses get less noticable and minuses more noticable after 50.  Wizards deal with more resists, so they have to resort to less efficient Lure spells in order to get full damage.  Enchanters have to deal with shorter duration mes spells because the others are all resisted.  Not only that, but the cost of their buffs past 50 reduces them completely to buffing and crowd control... many times buffing OR crowd control.  Rogues find that evade works less and less, to the point that a double backstab is the kiss of death for a rogue at really high levels, unless they have a really alert cleric.  Tanks have to deal with their taunts being less effective, which is bad news for clerics and pure casters, since a complete heal or a nuke could be the last thing coming from their hands until the corpse recovery.  Magicians and necros both have to rely more and more on their pets due to the resistance problems that EVERY caster faces... even wizards.  Shamen get some truly powerful spells, unfortunately they too are resisted around 80% of the time.  Some of their spells are just plain silly for most classes.  Some of everyones spells are just plain silly in fact.<P>Basically, 51-60 is just like 1-50.  As you level up, you get more powerful, but the creatures you are fighting get powerful at a faster rate than you.  Remember when you could solo 2 or 3 evens before stopping to rest?  Or yellows maybe?  Then by the time you got to 50, you were stuck with low blues and exp greens if you were lucky?  And if you made any mistakes, that low blue or high green could flatten you really fast.  51-60 is just continuing that trend, only it's all 50 levels of the 1-50 packed into 10 levels, so the difference of power increase is MUCH more noticable.  What makes it worse is that when kunark came out, people were having visions of being able to become powerful enough to solo again, or maybe some of em were even thinking about killing Vox or Nagafen by themselves, hoping to get a white dragon scale cloak or a Cloak of flames for their twink.  Little did they know... little do they still understand, that 51-60 is just picking up where 1-50 left off, and compressing 50 levels worth of overpowering to take only 10 levels.<P>I'm not disputing that necros are worse off against the mobs they're fighting at 60 than they were against the ones they were fighting at 50.  What I am disputing is that they are NOT worse off than the other classes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well I'll give my pence worth after reading this long long post  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Being a wizard I can appreciate the problem of being a post 50 necro, TBH I never realized that the necros were having these problems on uber raids. Sepharoth lvl 60 necro in our guild on BB is the most amazing necro I have played with. He has on at least one occasion mumbled something about being useless on uber raids but he often is calling out "who needs mana?" which he does without too much complaint on a ratio of 100 to 1<BR>Granted I believe that something needs to be done here but IMHO its not what the necros are doing at this high lvl that is wrong, I believe they are definitely very useful as mana batteries  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> -biased wizard  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> high lvl dungeon encounters oh yeah ! Seph saved our hides plenty when our Enchanter went down to some mean pathing bugs in Icewell. (Shyly admits he didnt know necros could "mez" until then). The problem to me is exactly what Rayger said in his post which is always what concerns me when these topics/psuedo rants ? are raized with Verant. Principal - simple . I appreciate that maintaning game balance in a fantasy world based on "static" rules can do nothing to prevent conflict when players with RL ideals and principals and most importantly logic start analysing game procedures and standpoints.<P>It has been said befor by Verant that the many nerfs that have been put in place are due mainly to "try" and maintain game balance. I remember reading a post on the patch message some months ago with Verant saying something like - Please note that two hundred testers cannot possible find all the unique exploits etc that two hundred players can find. This is too true - unfortunately for us. I personally find great pleasure in finding exploits ways to take advantage etc - this to me is fun and I do it on solo games as well  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> call me a sad git but its true  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Okay this said i can tell you what will happen with this necro issue as such. First of all<BR>Verant is not too stupid, they have known about this problem for some time now. The problem they have is to make necros valuable without making them too powerful as solo or plvling peeps. With the game chars and classes currently defined I would say that they have only one recourse. THEY MUST NERF THE WIZARD LURES or give necros a similar line of spells. IMO they will nerf the wizard lures. This is easier than making the necros more powerful. Please note that more powerful is not purely dmg based or ability to knock out a 60 mob solo at 60. Many other concerns feature here.<P>Right enough ranting <P>As said befor I am more concerned that the roll of a necro changes post 50 than I am of anything else said here. This MUST be advertised befor newbie players get roped into the class.
