</FONT><HR>-Mers-,<P>I write code for a living.  I always make my programs highly configurable.  Commenting is not an option.  How he designed the .ini file is weak, lame is a better word for it.  It reminds me of a newbie newhire programmer trying to solve a problem.<P>I would have had words with new hire programmers for doing less.  If these newhires persisted I would have recommended that they not stay their probation period.<P>If he can't defend himself then something is wrong.  He doesn't need you to do it.  If he agrees he'll say something.  If he doens't he'll say so also.  How will he say it?  Well, a regular programmer would just fix the problem and move on.  He would go back and make a change to add the comments to the file.  He would ensure that 1 line was used instead of 3.<P>Your response to me was pure bull****.  This is real life programming.  It is what he gets paid for.<P>Now, let me explain that he only used a function in the Windows API called Return=GetPrivateProfileString(paramater list) and use the opposite to write the string to the .ini file Return=WritePrivateProfileString(parameter list).<P>Each of these functions is defined in the Windows API.  They are so well documented that anyone can use them by creating a simple module.  You see, what he's changing in the interface is very basic.  It's what I like to do to make my programs more flexible and user configurable.  I do it by default.<P>Now you act as if I don't appreciate his changes.  Well I do.  <P>I just think he needed to know that he screwed up more then just on the one item from the last patch.  He screwed up on one of the most basic tennants of programming ("it's a program, it should do all the work").  Then when he tried to cover up the lack of testing with a statement that only proved he had failed to test was frankly an insult to common sense.<P>So, -Mers-, grow up and realize that even your idols can f' up.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Sheltim,<P>I realize that we both paid for a final product, not beta...  Still, if they choose to implement something and tell us specifically that "it's not quite ready for production, but play with it if you wish," then it's somewhat like beta, is it not?  (more like unsupported, I guess).<P>Still, don't get me wrong - I agree with you guys that changing the color scheme of all player bases initially was wrong, because it puts the unfinished product *into* production.<P>Oh... just to let you know, there are quite a bit of us who have poor vision and color recognition, and the color customizations have made our lives easier.  The folks with poor vision appreciate the patience and understanding that the good-vision folks have for getting Verant to implement this for us.  =)<P>lv.45 cleric, sol ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Sheltim:  The color changes were ABSOLUTLY necessary for some of us.  I, like Sodakat, am a member of that poor, down-trodden(sp?) minority, the color-blind male.  Some of the default colors have so little contrast that they are virtually IMPOSSIBLE to read.  What Rowyl did for us has been a great blessing!  (Thank you, Thank you, Thank you)  So he goofed a bit.  BFD, now you get a little taste of what I and the others like me live with every day of our lives, and, he's going to fix it for you.  Remember, I CAN'T fix mine.  I'm sure most of the Icons for things are quite pretty, I can't tell.  And I'll believe you when you say that little group of pixels is a MOB across the valley, but I don't have a clue where it is.  Sigh  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>:em climbs off soapbox<P>Thanks, Rowyl, for making my game experience just that little bit better.

The easiest way though is probably to go to castersrealm and use their program for it.  Of course, I'm sure that Rowyl will set the defaults to how the game originally was, so just deleting the eqclient.ini file in your everquest directory (the same place screenshots are) should do the trick once the fix goes live.  When you run EQ again, it will make a new eqclient.ini file with the default color scheme.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;This was not a matter of lack of testing. It was simply a matter of not realizing the impact of grouping ALL spell messages together in one color class. I realize the issue, and have already addressed it (should go in next patch). I honestly didn't think it was a problem since I focus more on what the message says then what color it is, but I can see where color can be used to help pick out what's important to you.<P>Don't take the criticism the wrong way... simply put, for many of us, when we are in a group of 6, with other casters and mobs casting, weapons proc'ing... we rely upon colors, a lot.  Especially us enchanters, who need to move from target to target quickly, often at the beginning of combat, when the spam is most hellacious.  But you already know that, I'm sure you've heard it enough by now...<P>In terms of my comment of taking it to test first, this has to do not with the quality of the work but that interface changes can impact a lot of people.  Now, the basic change was a great move for color blind people and many of the rest of us as well.  However, these changes are not crucial, there is no must have time element.  By taking them to test for a week first, you can get feedback from a small number of players that play on test for just such a reason, to try things out before others.  And headaches like this can be avoided.<P>We all come out ahead.<P>And as I've said previously, keep up the great work.  Looking forward to the day you decide to move the spell icons to the lower right hand corner of the screen in fullscreen mode <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Arggg:<P>You are correct, I just used the Windows API calls for private profile strings, and yes I could have spent the time to add comments to the ini file. However, I knew that the moment the file was in place that people would make "eqclient.ini" file editor programs that would put an interface on it far better then adding comments to the ini file. I was proven right when 2 such programs were released the day the ini file went live, and now there are several more.<P>Also, I do plan so allow you to change the colors in game with the client. You will be able to use / commands and also navigate through the options menus to change the colors. I believe this has been stated at least twice before by me here on the boards. So the ini file is merely a configuration file for what you will be able to change in game. I could have easily chosen to make it a binary file in a proprietary format, but I chose the ini format because it was simpler to implement (good old Win32 API), and I knew that it could be edited easily (even if the keywords I chose were cryptic).<P>So I made the choice to implement the bare minimum in the ini file itself. If I had intended for the ini file to be the only way to change it I would have made it much more user friendly.<P>-Rowyl</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I've already explained why there had to be color changes in the process of implementing the custom color feature. To recap, if I was to leave all the text messages there original color but be editable, I would have to have hundreds of user colors to cover every message and it would be pretty unweildy. I chose to group similar types of text together into classes. My original implementation didn't have enough text classes, so I have added several more. I apoligize that I didn't have more in the beginning, but hopefully after this week we can all put this behind us.<P>The 2 new classes I added for spells (others messages, and failure messages) are user 33 and 34, and since you current ini files don't have them you will use the defaults (failures in red, and others in a darker blue then your own spells). Any new classes I add will be above 34 so you will get defaults instead of what was already in your ini file (like what happened for 26 to 32).<P>I also plane to get get the "old default" colors and code them in as defaults so that you can delete your ini file and when it creates the new one it will be back to almost what it was before I did any changes.<P>-Rowyl</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Just like to make an aside an a(potentially old) comment of Rowyl's regarding the timeliness of client changes.<P>I, as many of you, am a professional software developer.  Features are not coded in a box. They are planned and scheduled for a release point, then tested, and released.  If your feature happens to get bundled into a release with more complex/difficult features, then it _will_ be delayed.  If it's going to be delayed by a lot, then you can ***** and moan and maybe get it pulled into a release by itself.  If it's going to be delayed by a day or two, no director in their right mind is going to make a whole new release process so your "easy" fix can go out.<P>On a real-time release schedule what this means is... Programmer A gets a bug fix/feature request on Monday, and plans to implement it by Wednesday to get out on Friday.  Programmer B(in this case Rowyl) gets a trivial feature/bug Tues night/Wed morning. Programmer B then implements their fix and runs around the office all day to make sure it gets in the release on Friday.  Lo and behold, QA finds problems with Programmer A's feature/fix, release is held up til Tuesday.  Now apparently all the Programmer B has to show for their work and diligence and a little extra to get in as soon as possible, and the probable mistake of letting the customer base know when it was going in, is to be flamed...<P>MKaath Darkfall</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

They can make the ini file however they want, and as Rowyl already mentioned, they could have also made it a propriety binary file if they so desired.<P>Instead they did some great changes to the interface, and made a very "simple" ini file so that anyone who had the desire and skill could make some nifty little ini editors. The fact that there were two such programs out by the end of the day that the patch was done, shows that the ini file easy enough to understand.<P>I pity any of the "newhires" you use as an example if they have to work under your supervision. And besides, if you want to attack someone on a professional level then do it out from under a blanket of anonymity and post your real name and credentials. Otherwise your just another fart in the wind.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Last thing I got time for is changing my dodge messages to seafoam green or fizzles to candy apple red. I can tell you I was NOT happy the first time I died when I started to med thinking my fear took when it didn't. In that first day alot of casters lost alot of XP before we realized that the resist colors had changed. So if you want to make changes and put the ini in for those that want to use it fine but don't screw those up that don't use it.

</FONT><HR>Hey Rowyl,<P>Keep up the good work, man!  I for one would prefer to have the option to change colors and deal with some problems while you fine tune the design than have not had the enchancement.  <P>It is nice to see so many potentially useful UI improvement in the works.  I can't wait for the /book command to go live and the select the group's pets code would be fantastic if you can get that to work.  I never buff charmed pets anyway, so no biggie there.  I'm willing to deal with potholes along the way to get them implemented, in the end I think they will be great changes to the interface.<P>On that note, do you have any ideas about how to make selecting a partiular mob easier in a largish group of mobs?  I play a chanter and sometimes find it very difficult to select a mob, even if I can clearly distinguish it visually.  Is there any possibility of getting a pop up menu, or a track like window to select from a list of mobs that could be selected.  ( I assume that the current algorithm selects the closest mob at that pixel while approximating the mobs shape with a circle.)  A left shift-click instead of a simple left click would allow you to keep the current select method and add additional selection capability for when the current selection algorithms are not working.  Snowballs chance of something along these lines working?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Rowyl (mainly Verant, not to be taken personally by Rowyl)<P>Please stop making small incremental patches that are not fully tested and truly complete; they introduce problems.  Not only does it break things for everyone, but causes more patch outages than would probably be necessary otherwise, because you end up burning time fixing problems introduced in previous patches.  We are now weeks into a simple color enhancement patch, and even now the client will not create an ini with the ORIGINAL default colors.  This is disappearing feature syndrome at its worst, where you break the interface (client colors) and then rely on the fan community to provide the fix.<P>I think it would make sense to schedule patch days monthly or bi-monthly, and any enhancements that are not FEATURE COMPLETE AND WORKING do not go into the patch for that day.  With patches scheduled for known dates in the future, you should easily be able to pick the dates to aim for with regard to a given enhancement, which makes your life easier in the long run also.  The appearance that has been given recently with patches that have contained mild to severe brokenness is that development continues down to the wire, and features go into the client or servers in an incomplete and untested state simply because there was no more time.<P>I implore you to do something to stabilize the development / patch process within the EQ Dev / Live / Whatever teams.  You guys have a winning product here, but you can easily wreck it by hurting the user experience.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006728-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006728.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006728-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=006728&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=006728&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
