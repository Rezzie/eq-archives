</FONT><HR>While I understand there are very good "world" type rationales for buffing up CT and Inny, you must realize that PoF and PoH serve as a MAJOR testing ground for up and coming guilds to learn big raid tactics and feel they are playing part of the "Epic" game.  It has been working out well so far.  Right now because there is bigger and badder game out there with much phatter lewtz, the uber crowd is happy to leave the up and comers to earn their stripes there without much interference except for the occasional run in over the epic quest items.  If you go forward with these changes please be sensitive to the role these planes serve not only in a "world" sense but also in how it affects the environment all players game in.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Agreed... there are no zones for the 46-53 crowd unless you could Sol B (where people can start at 35, gets kind of old by 52) and Lower Guk (is this place not crowded enough already?).<P>PoH and PoF are perfect places for up-and-coming players and guild to learn how to do raids without ridiculous risk. People still lose bodies in those places. Raids still get wiped out in these planes. Moreover, they are not part of any expansion and as such are the ultimate zones for non-expansion players at level 50.<P>If these planes are altered so as to be more difficult it will further increase the gap between the haves and have-nots; the haves will still do these places easily and the have-nots will have their access to plane gear severely restricted. Is this what VI wants, to make second-tier players dependent upon the uber players in order to advance? To eliminate the possibility of these players to try raid zones in Velious, for which you need a minimum of plane armor? They have enough problems with the frustration of these players as it is, it would be a very ill-witted move to go further in that direction.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

As it is, a level 58 Enchanter still finds exceeding difficulty with crowd control on several mobs in both planes, making chain pulling or suicide wishing mandatory. <P>But only Verant could totally abandon its sub-level-55 players who aren't in uber guilds and consider upscaling Hate and Fear for level 60 players with epics. /boggle<P>Someone take the crack away from the Live team, please.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Think you all are missing a huge point of the argument because alot of you probably are just basing this on hear say instead of actual facts.<P>Fact: On older servers, PoF & PoH are empty the majority of the times.  Uber guilds go in and clear Fear/Hate every patch/deity repop regardless of if lesser players want to go or not.  There's literally no way you can kill CT/Inny buffed or unbuffed, because uber guilds are farming them for epic pieces.  Therefore, the only reason Fear/Hate exists is for lower level farmers who have yet to gain planes gear.<P>Fact: If all you want to do is farm Hate/Fear for planes gear, it's better to let Verant move the planes gear to another zone, since it's easier than breaking in the plane.<P>Rumor: The planes is a testing ground of lower level guilds.  This might be true, if not for the fact that most lower guilds I see bring in their big 55+ friends each time they raid the planes so there's frankly no challenge anyways.<P>Fact: Most Kunark gear surpasses planes gear.<P>Rumor: Level 46-50 people actually raid the planes.  Yes, they do it sometimes, but from 46 to 51 takes about two weeks of casual grouping.  Most high level people are in the range of 54-60, not in the range of 46-50, so really if PoF/PoH are made 46-50 only all it would benefit is maybe 10% of the population at most.  <P>Fact: There is a general influx of high level players resulting from lower level players that have now leveled up.  These people have formed multiple uber guilds on many different servers and even the "many things for 55+" are often not enough for 200+ 55+ players looking to do something.<P>Fact: Verant knows that there will only be more high level players as time goes on.<P>Rumor: The change to Naggy/Vox is a good idea.  Not really, now instead of going to kill'em themselves, uber guilds just have uber twinks at the ready to kill them for their guild.  Most level 60 players have at least 1 level 50, and many have several.  Players that are just coming to age in the 46-53 ranges(the range for Nag/Vox) are really just breezing through those levels instead of raiding Nag/Vox.  <P>Anyways, hope that clears up somethings.  I have no opinion myself on the changes to PoF/PoH.  It's clear that Verant wants to prolong the level 55+ crowd, since it's obvious that everyone who isn't going to quit is eventually going to be 55+.  This, IMO, tells me something: Permanent death is a good idea for MMORPGs.  Not everyone should eventually become heroes, or otherwise the lower level dungeons will be neglected, and the higher ones in too much distress.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have to agree that most hate and fear raids (on Lanys anyway, which is 14 months old) don't involve 46-50 as much as they do 50-60.  Indeed, often the lowest level present on the raids I've been to is 49-51.  HOWEVER, increasing the difficulty and drops from the gods there will encourage high level guilds (read: 55+ that have the planes gear they need) to return.  Again, on Lanys, both planes are rather crowded as it is (see http://www.calsnet.com/lanyscalendar)...we don't need more incentive for people to hit these planes.<P>Consider the magnitude of these pros and cons...on one hand, it's cheesy for gods to be slain easily -- not game-destroying, just cheesy.  On the other, overcrowding can (and has in many places) caused *major* conflict between players and guilds.  The frustration in raid disputes FAR EXCEEDS any "realism concerns" with gods.<P>Aatudien, 54 necro, Lanys</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here is my suggestion on what they should do with the planes and also Naggy and Vox.  I believe for story line and premise, and because they did say they were going to, the gods themselves should be upgraded, but I believe ONLY the gods should be upgraded. I think this can best be achieved, as was suggested by another poster, with the addition of new boss lair zones, thus leaving what has been to this point the planes, alone. Thus creating a newer harder boss zone within the planes, and of course, moving/scaling the loot accordingly.  I like this idea because it simply goes against what I consider to be logical, or at least consistant, with regard to the fact that THE GODS are supposed to be just that, The Gods.  I personally believe none of the Gods of Norrath should be anything less than lvl 60, probably higher, otherwise it doesn't make sense.  I think this would work best if in the new boss zones new and different loot should be assigned, and the old loot previously dropped in the planes should be left alone, that way the gods get the upgrade that for storyline purposes makes sense, all the people crying about just reaching the planes worthy levels will still have planes and corresponding loot, just not the gods yet, and there will be a created opportunity to add either more uber loot, or at least more mobs that can drop some of the uber loot many ppl feel drops far too rarely, not to mention a killer set of new super high level zones.  This is the solution I think would work best for this problem.  Also I personally never liked the idea of being too high a level for any mob in the game, I mean you as a player have never been too low for a high mob to slaughter, and I believe your reward for putting in the time and effort to now con even to that mob entitles you to hand him his arse.  It is with that sentiment in mind that I found it offensive that Vox/Nagafen were given lvl caps.  I mean after working so hard and getting to a high level after having these dragons kill countless numbers of ppl, and then to find out that now that you stand a reasonable chance of victory over these dragons you aren't alolowed to fight them??  If a player can never get ahead of the power curve even though he levels his butt off, and only ever stays with it, that means getting those levels effectively yields no reward and very little sense of accomplishment.  As a general statement not a flame, I believe Everquest has a very weak even sucky high end game in terms of the level of reward for finally getting to level 60, mainly because you cannot even fight the smallest of experience giving mobs without it being a very close, you barely lived fight(admittedly that is not all cases but far too many considering ytou have reached the pinnacle of the game level wise).  Thus I believe Vox/Nagafen being level capped is almost a slap in the face to those who busted ass to get stronger than them and now cannot even take a small measure of revenge and get the satisfaction of handing them their asses for a change.  Thank you for your time.<P>Jackbomb,<BR>Player of many classes, of high and low levels.   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I totally agree with this topic.<P>I've been playing for going on 15 months now, and have finally gotten one of my characters to 46..entry level for the old planes & dragons.  <P>I am not dilusional in thinking I will ever get a character to level 60, or that I will ever have a character in full uber stuff...or any real uber stuff for that matter.  I am a casual player with very real time constraints, and I probably will never have the time required to get a character to level 60. <P>Going to the planes and getting a piece or two of planer armor is a very real goal of mine, one I've had since the very day I learned planes & Gods existed.  I don't think I'd be incorrect to assume this is a goal of each and every player who makes it past level 20.<P>But, if the old planes are raised a bar or two to provide the ever-growing population of 55-60 level players with added difficulty & items, it essentially eliminates my chances of reaching my goal.  Perhaps level 46-49 players would still be able to go on plane raids...but not as a vital asset.  If the mobs were buffed to equal POG's, then I would become a liability.<P>I've read many times that the average player will never reach post 50, fewer still post 55 and only a remote few of the percentage 60.  So, if there is more players in the 46-50 range then the 55-60 range, why not cater to the masses and leave the old planes as-is?<P>Perhaps the Gods need to be looked at, I'll agree to that.  It does seem a bit odd in retrospect that the God of Hate....( a GOD! ) is less powerful than a dragon, or some common mobs found elsewhere.  But, instead of making the current Gods impossible for a 46-50 raid party....replace Gods with avatars or something with the same drops.  Then buff the Gods and move them to a new location, creating new item drops representing the new risk v/s reward factor.<P>I do know this - if the old planes are buffed to cater to the demands of the elite 55-60 crowd then I might as well go on a dragon raid and call it quits.  Perhaps I am wrong, but I think ROK and SOV is plenty of room to let the top dogs play.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>/sigh<P>I laugh and cry at the same time when people say that PoG is easier than PoF or PoH its a friggin joke.<P>If you have actually tried hunting in the PoG you know that once you clear the roamers mobs start getting into the lvl 56-58 range.  PoH can be done with a single group of lvl 55+ players.<P>PoH and PoF are clearly lvl 46-52 lvl appropriate zones.<P>I would like to see 2 lvl 47 groups try and do the PoG, at best they will clear a few roamers *IF* they survive the Protectors.  I highly doubt that a lvl 47 group could do much of anything in the POG<P>If you have actually been there you would know that it is a very tough zone, not because you have to chain pull or FD pull or use some other old world tactic, but because of the protectors who spawn every XX min and are lvl 54+ mobs that resist tradition crowd control tactics, and it makes the zone take a lot longer than fear where you just clear roamers than begin to farm or hate where you farm right away and kill any add roamers.<P>PoG is not an easy zone, many roamer mobs are lvl 50 or so and resist magic a lot.  The people who say PoG is easy are the following<P><BR>1. uberguilds with 10-20 lvl 51+ clerics who clear VP on their way to sleepers tomb (yeah its easier than VP so what)<P>2. Uber guild rump swabs who agree with anything uber guilds say and routinely wash their feet and brown nose them on the boards and in game<P>3. people who have never been there but believe the hype on message boards.<P>Get a friggin clue PoG is waaaay harder than PoH and PoF I have done all the zones mentioned.  PoG is not the hardest zone in the game,  but considering the risk/reward i think lvl 58 roaming mobs that nuke and summon is about right expecially with the protectors spawning all the time and you have to fight them, <P>there is no mass AFK in PoG like you can do in fear where everyone goes AFK for 30 min while the pull team takes a shower or in hate, where people just camp out in hate and wait for the zone to pop</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I've heard from guild sources and others about the changes to these planes. I'd like to hear directly from someone on test server. But, this is a summary of what I've heard so far, take ti or leave it:<P>Gods buffed to con red at 60. Meaning they are level 63+ most likely 65ish...<P>New boss mobs added at level 55 each. Boss mob for each of the main type of mob. And example would be a boss Spite Golem, boss Revenant, etc etc.<P>The new boss mobs drop the old god loot...<P>Slightly new pathing changes on roaming mobs. For instance the SW corner is no longer safe in Hate.<P>Slight aggro changes. I've heard that sometimes random mobs from the second floor will aggro on a group below...<P>All in all I think the whole thing makes sense. Why on earth they put epic quest items on once a week spawns, highly contested ones to boot, is beyond me. Better to make it rare off of a more common mob I'd think. Waiting for a shot at Cazic Thule could mean months easily. Just going to PoF to kill priests for a rare drop could take days, maybe weeks. If it's a semi-normal spawn you could go even when the god himself was dead. Killing the god then just becomes a bonus, really.<P>What I'd like to see is Venril Sathir changed as well. Instead of 7 days, drop him to 3 days or just randomize his spawn. He's probably the most contested spawn in the history of the game now that at least 2 classes need epic drops from him.<P>How about taking the old planes armore out of PoH and PoF entirely if the normal mobs there are upped? Replace it with something new, using velious models, but old world colors.<P>Take SK armor for example. Umbral Breastplate from PoF is 30ac with stats. Noctivagant from PoG is 42ac with stats. Now we're talking about upping PoF to possibly the difficulty of PoG or near it, replace the armor to match. Take Umbral out of all drop rotation. Make that old school, no-longer drops stuff. Give us new armor, Ashenbone Platemail for an example name, that is a pitch black version of the PoG armor texture.<P>Do the same for all class armor from those two planes...<P>Another suggestion might be to add new drops to those other planes to allow us to upgrade our old armor. Put in some junk items, NO DROP, that drop in the opposite plane of the class armor that can be turned in to a new Quest NPC Blacksmith in the EC tunnel along with the old planar gear to give us similar stats and ac to PoG and Kunark gear.<P>For example, turn in the Umbral Platemail Breastplate along with Chip of Spite Golem and 2 Enchanted Platinum Bars for Ashenbone Platemail Breastplate (SK only, ALL races).<P>Also, up the drop ratio a tad on Velious armor quest items. Seems to me this stuff is like Darkforge times 50. And Darkforge can take up to 15 levels or more to get becouse of how hard it is to get the decayed armor you need from CT.<P>Just a few ideas...<P>I do think it's good these planes are getting an upgrade though. And the new loot tables for the old god loot will really help people like Shadow Knights, Necros etc finish their epics.<P>Vendric Ravenkrest<BR>51 Reaver of Hate<BR>Ancient Council - Saryrn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Not that this matters, but from a roleplay and historical point of view, these creatures(ie: Cazic Thule, Innoruuk, Tunare etc.) are not gods. We look at them as gods because they created us, but the history of Norrath never refers to them as gods. If anything they are highly advanced beings created by The Nameless. Who by the way seems to represent more of a god than anything listed in EQ History. So you have these beings that created the races of Norrath. Of course we would look to them as gods. But nobody says in all of Norrathian history that these guys are omnipotent immortals. So why cant they be killed? Why do they have to be so much more powerful? They created life? So what. What does that prove really? How do you know thats not their only ability? <P>I just dont see a need for these planes to be upgraded to uber standards. Why not leave Cazic and Innoruuk alone and just include these so called level 55 boss mobs that could either drop new loot or drop quest pieces. I mean..isnt that what this is all about really? Some poor uber guild doesnt have all their twinks decked out in epic weapons yet? Let me get my tissues so I can cry for them.<P>Dont you realize you are removing a part of the game that is a milestone in a guild or players history? Youre going to rob them of the first time they broke PoF or PoH and faced off with a god. Well, they can still do it, but they will need their uber buddies to power level them to 60 first. Oh wait...not everyone has uber buddies? Uh oh...someone better tell Verant. I think they believe were all in 100+ member guilds where everyone is over 55. <P>I dont understand it. It is almost like you want people to leave...and I know thats silly...but I swear thats what it feels like.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If I was in an uber-guild I wouldn't want PoF/PoH upgraded at all - they have spent ungodly (heh I like puns) amounts of time up there already in order to get epic quest items, not to mention the time they spent there in the normal course of raiding pre-kunark and pre-velious. Why would they want to have to spend more time there?  To top it all off, PoH and PoF are easily the largest sources of friction on any server - competing for raid times is a real pain and something most uber-guilds were happy to get away from (only to get mired in VS/Trak/VP raid scheduling hehe).<P>First theory (the cynical one):<BR>This god-buffing (if it goes to the live servers) is simply a way for VI to "recycle" an old zone in order to keep the highest player bracket around longer (hence more money in subscription fees)- unfortunately it would shaft the players who are 46-50ish who want to attempt raids nowadays...<P>Second Theory (the sensible one):<BR>My personal theory on this test server buffage is that the guilds on Test aren't powerful/numerous enough to be routinely attempting Velketor/Vindicator/Yelinak/Dain raids etc so the new changes to CH taunt effects are hard to judge on the test server - so the solution is to buff the gods that are routinely reachable by guilds on Test - which happen to lie in the planes - this way VI can get data faster  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hey look at it this way....<P>If you liked the changes to Clerics you will LOVE the changes to the Planes  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>I have a:<P>51 Wizard who is shelved until wizards are fixed and that ain't gonna happen..<P>42 Cleric that I started playing because of the wizard being defunct.  And now she is shelved..<P>27 Shaman (Barbarian) who looks like a blonde airhead because of the screwed up artwork for the Rygorr Helm. Can't play her because of the constant /tells wanting to know what is wrong with her head and did I know the back of her head was missing and/or is it their video card messing up.  yeah, yeah get another helm but there isn't another helm with stats this good that a level 27 can afford.<P>21 Iksar Monk that I can't use MEND on because there is a mend bug that happened last patch.  It tells you you have 1 second before you can use the button but the button stays grayed out it's full length of time AGAIN.  So, this character is now screwed.<P>36 Rogue who has been nerfed for no reason.  There was nothing wrong with evade tactics.  Why not just be a monk and forget it?  Oh yeah, the monks are broken too...<P>Then there is the level 16 enchanter that I don't like but she has spent too much money getting that expensive jewelry skill up so I won't delete her.  She's just a wizard with a pet at this level anyway.  And, a mule because there isn't enough room on any of these characters for the regents, quest modules, trade skill garbage.. now that there is so much no drop stuff like keys and other quest items.<P>The only playable character I have on the account is a 27 necromancer.  Gawd, please don't tell Verant that one is still working!<P>So, if I want to make more characters I have to buy another account.  Anyone see a trend forming here?<P>Anyway... I am SURE we will all LOVE the changes for the Planes since we have appreciated so much the changes to the classes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I kinda see both sides of the coin here, On one hand fear and hate are good places to learn how to do large scale raids on a zone and I think they should stay that way...<P>on the other hand, I con frogs in selb that are higher then cazic thule, The two gods are a FAR cry from God-hood, when a group of 15-17 people can kill a god..well there is something wrong with that...<P>the big problem ic with beefing up the gods is the loot, you would pretty much have to redo the loot table for both, move the epic drops to someplace else then throw on the Super uber loot you are seeing come out of SoV...<P>Again the problem with that, you will have the greedy uber guilds that have for the most part left fear and hate(cept for epic farming) for more uber loot to come back and farm them 24/7 again, seeing how everyone knows how to break the zones with lil trouble now.<P>and the other thing would be, you make the gods Uber, you will probalby have to beef up everything else..why have an uber god with puny minons hanging around??<P>I agrea the Gods are weak..they are after all GODS...cept for the children of Veeshan, these guys should be the cream-dal-crim of the world, but just going in and adding a couple 100K to their hp's and double or triple their damage output is not the answer..its just an easy fix...and we all know how much VI loves the easy fix </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
