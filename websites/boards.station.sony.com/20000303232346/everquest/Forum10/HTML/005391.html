</FONT><HR>It would be nice if Wizards and Druids "the masters of travel" had the following:<P>1. The ability to have a secondary bind point.  It would be nice to be able to teleport someone and return without losing your "home" bind point.  <P>There are numerous times when someone needs a lift out but no porters will take them due to the fact that they will lose their bind point or bind in an unsafe location.  You can find this occuring at almost any "event" but lets use PoF as an example.  For some reason someone has to leave before a breakin is completed (maybe an angry mother forcing one off the computer, or maybe he has had 4 or 5 deaths too many) and needs a lift.   <P>One of 3 things will happen:<P>  a) A Porter will have to bind on the "unsafe" hill and chance LOADING back into trouble after a death - not really a nice option for someone that is trying to help out another player.<BR>  b) A Porter will gate the person out and have to chance another run through the portal - which can lead to trains and/or deaths - again not really a nice ending for a helpfull player.<BR>  c)  The character is forced to camp in hopes that the area will be clear to zone into at a later date so that he may make his escape - which is not a valid option at long camps like Efreeti<P><BR>2. The ability to teleport someone to your bind point.  It would be nice to be able to gate out and grab a friend that just comes online and have him join you at a camp.  <P>For Example - wandering around Kedge and a friend gets on that would like to join.  He happens to be a Tank currently in NRo.  He will need a port and then have a nice run to kedge - at which point we have to backtrack to zone to grab him, or leave him to feed the fishes.<P>If the first suggestion was implemented I would suggest that the second spell only allow you to port others to your "home" bind point and that the primary and secondary bind points not be allowed in the same zone.  This will place the caster at risk to MDS (multiple death syndrome upon LOADING) which should help discourage and/or eliminate  abuse.<P>If the time for the these spells is not now then maybe they can sneak themseleves into the expansion ...<P><BR>I would like to see Wizards become - not more powerfull - but more "group friendly."<P><BR>Pluton<BR>Lvl 50 Wizard - Bertoxxulous</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Great idea but to easy to bind yourself to the Sage Room in LGuk or other tough spawn area to get to. <P>Rather what about "Bind City" where you have to perhaps do a quest for the mayor - faction, etc. In order to get the "key to the city" to use the city gate or something close to that effect. Wouldn't that make travel to Qeynos and Halas much easier.<P>Anyways certainly a spell line that could be very doable but limited to where.<P>Lenaddar Anatar of Povar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>     I fully agree.  Wizard's need something to make us more "group friendly" and this would be an excellent addition.  Also, if a time-limit was put on the bind as someone suggested, I think that would eleminate any camping/farming problems.  An excellent idea, Verant should implement this one!<P>~Millanthar Drevis<BR>36 Wizard, Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hi, I would like to make comment and suggestion on the porting issue.  I had even suggested in a feedback that a group teleport to the wizards bind point would rock, but was summarily shot down by the wizard camping rare spawn issue.  I would however like to suggest that a series of Port spells be added, a city series.  A spell for each city in the game.  I also agree with the idea to maybe make them by quest only, seems more fun.  I would also recommend a spell maybe called "Backtrack", which would return a caster to the last coordinates he teleported from.  That way a friendly wizard trying to help somebody else wouldn't be put out by doing so, he could just Tp his charge, then cast "Backtrack", and return to where he was, no prob, just mana spent.  I definitely would like for wizards to have more group value, heck, more value across the board, so as to keep them useful.  I also want wizard players to not have to think twice about using their semi-unique gift of teleporting for other players. Well those are my TP thoughts for wizards, and i thank you for the forum. <BR>               Dominemesis Fyrefaunt, Spirit of Rivendell, Karana Server. <BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR> I hate to bring this up 'cause it might be an exploit. I have, in the past, used "Flinging" to send someone some where. You just start a group teleport as normal but JUST before you finish casting type "/quit" . If you time it right you will send your party but you will be at the same place when you log back in.<P>  It would be nice if  verant would just "legalise" this somehow. Perhaps a new line of send only spells.<P>   DP.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Perhaps a variation on Evac. Transports party members to a few select locations. But, like the resurect spell, it pops up a yes / no box "Do you want to be transported". Every party member could decide to transport or not. This would handle the problem. I dont think it would unbalance the class either.<P>Or maybe a "Gate my Target" spell. Group memebers only of course. This might make it a bit too easy to get around. But perhaps if there was only one destination for the spell? Maybe the proposed Auction Zone. <P>It would also add an interesting element to the game if you could send people to places you cant get to yourself. <P>It would give some advandages to all the classes without good transport skills. If there was an output point around Qeynos for example, Barbarians could get to Perma easier. <P>Or OOT. A neutral location but a ***** to get out of. Or some out of the way spot in the expansion. <P>It seems all of the high traffic areas are around the wizard/druid bind points. Other destinations could help shift traffic to less used areas.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I always felt a "permenant" bind spot was called for. Hell you are a wizard...you should have at the minimum a direct port to your home city. And the idea of Backtrack mentioned prior also sounds very good. It would be possiable but not very exciting to be able to port to every inch of Norrath , but where is the fun in that?<BR>The idea of making the porting more interesting is what would make it a great thing. And because it would be an extra special ability (like backtrack or porting an individual "not including yourself" somewhere), a quest to obtain that skill seems quite reasonable.<P>Kildayar 18th Dark Elf Wizard ! <BR>Bertoxxulous</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>First I would like to thank everyone for their feedback.  There are a lot of good ideas here that hopefully Verrant will make use of.<P>I agree that a time limit on the secondary bind would help limit abuse such as camp hopping - Great Idea.<P>The backtrack method is another way to accomplish many of the same goals as the secondary bind while further limiting its funcionality and chance for abuse.<P><BR>City portals would be great, but Verrant has placed some portals relatively close to a city us (GFay, Nek, Riverdale, etc...) - there is no need for us to become TOO lazy.  <P>I do agree that the West Karana Gate is pretty useless and should be moved to QHills - or at least closer to the zone.  There are a few places that still require a nice hike to get to (OOT, Qeynos, Lake Rathe, Highhold, etc ...).<P>The "teleport other" with a yes/no port option is also a great idea.  This will avoid the constant regroupings and help us shuttle people around more efficiently.  It will also save us time and manna.  I would not like to see this appear on the group ports since it would hamper our ability to gate the "sleepers" out to a safe spot (I think it's an unwritten rule that you have to fall asleep at a camp at least once to become a "hardcore" player).<P>I have tried the "flinging" tactic before but of course I went back to the main login screen after a /q and couldnt reconnect to the chat server for 15 mins.  Needless to say I was frustrated to the point where I was almost sorry I helped someone in need.<P>The idea of porting people to your bind point has already been rejected due to the farming issues but about the only place I can REALISTICALLY see that as a problem would be the Efreeti in SolB.  Pretty much everything else is fairly easy to get to - especially with the overcrowding issues (most of the time I can walk all over Lower Guk without Invisiblity to Undead).  Currently people that farm just wait until someone comes to relieve them before logging.  The only benefit this would give farmers is a small time savings - IF they are a porting class.  I see it as a huge benefit for those of us that will not use it for this purpose.  Again, it would be really nice to be able to meet up with a friend that logs on instead of waiting 30 mins or giving up your camp.  Since most of us have either work or school and do not play more then 4 hrs a day - it can really help when trying to meet with a standard group of friends that all login at different times and different places.  Another great use for this is a Vox run.  By the time the last person arrives the Ice Giants are already dead and everyone is just sitting around killing the lower levels spawns out of boredom (which of course effects the lower characters).  And lets not forget about the people that are needed and have to log or those that arrive late.  We either have to wait another 45 minutes to fill the spot or go in short handed - not bad in itself unless its a Tank group that has just lost its cleric and the Caster group is already Dragon Fodder (without a healer).<P>Pluton<BR>Lvl 50 Wizard - Bertoxxulous</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I ran a MUD for years, and "Mages" had the ability to establish multiple "portal points".  The drawback to the portals was a certain failure rate -- which could sometimes be deadly.  Here's how it worked.  The Mage would cast a bindpoint on an object or character (PC or NPC) to mark that object as a destination.  Obviously agressive mobs didn't like this.  As far as objects, if a PC picked up the object, there's no telling where that portal would end up.  Also, if the PC/NPC dies the bindpoint is gone.<P>The rough part of my implementation was that there was a certain percentage of failure.  If the spell failed you could end up in the wrong zone, and the bindpoint would be erased.  The spell should be given to wizards starting at the bind level (level 12 for wizards) to teach them early that it's not to be abused -- similar to Evac spells later.<P>If you happened to fail and were tossed in the middle of Unrest, for example, you'd certainly die if you were &lt;30, as could the person you were toting along with you.  Of course there was also the risk of leaving someone behind.  Once that bind point was used, it is erased.<P>Just an idea from one fantasy game coder to another.<P>Regards,<BR>Miraquai Cai'Namoryp<BR>Mithaniel Marr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Someone brought up an interesting argument with regards to my previous post.  They indicated that normal Portal and Gate spells should also have a certain failure rate as well.<P>However, it stands to reason that those spells would not fail in a similar fashion because they have a designated destination -- a beacon -- for that particular class (Wizard Spires for wizards, Druid Rings for druids).  Those particular destinations are assumed to be concentrations of power greater than that of any mortal Druid or Wizard.  As such, homing in on those powerful beacons -- assuming the spellcasting is not interrupted or fizzles -- should be guaranteed.<P>That is how it is implemented currently, and it made sense to me immediately once it was placed into the fantasy context.<P>More thoughts.<P>Regards,<BR>Miraquai Cai'Namoryp<BR>Mithaniel Marr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Although I like the idea of a failure porting you to a different place I don't think it's doable unless it sent you to a relatively "safe" place.  Imagine porting a Tank bound in Qeynos into the middle of the Fire Giants in SolB.  This would be a nightmare corpse recovery.<P>Pluton</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>"Safe"?<P>The wizard class is already one of the most powerful classes, that's why I play them almost exclusively.  I enjoy the freedom.  There are drawbacks, of course.  It's hard to solo, for example.<P>I think putting in a dangerous failure in such a powerful set of spells is a fair risk for that kind of mobility.  I'm not talking about extreme failure rates.  It's really up to Verant anyway -- this is all just wishing. But I'm pretty sure that Verant doesn't want some class that can go anywhere at any time without some sort of disadvantage to discourage the abuses that accompany this extra power.<P>You know how people play EQ.  MOST do not adventure at all.  MOST camp a place and stay there for 4 to 5 levels.  MOST would use this spell to maintain a camp.  You throw in a deadly risk -- they'll think twice after falling in front of a mob equal to or 1 to 2 levels above them.  In other words, the failure rates I'm talking about merely discourage the frequent and repetative use of the spell set.<P>People want everything to be easy, and safe. Well, the fantasy world in EQ is already extremely "safe".  I have managed to get a wizard to level 30 in 7 days (approx 150 hours).  This, in spite of the resist caps, and the supposed "limited ability to travel". <P>I don't like how root or enstill work.  None of the level 20 spells are useful, period.  Now I could complain about this to Verant and cry about how "unfair" it is.  But I know better.  Wizards are NOT tanks, if they want to take on creatures that require a tank, they had better group.  If they choose not to do that, the risk is death and XP loss.<P>The point of all that is to make clear that there is nothing "weak" about the class already.  So having a fair failure rate -- with it's dangers -- is not unfair to the wizard class.<P>Glad everything is not easy as pie -- where's the fun without the risk?<P>Regards,<BR>Miraquai Cai'Namoryp<BR>Mithaniel Marr<P><BR>Regards,<BR>Miraquai Cai'Namoryp<BR>Mithaniel Marr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I play a druid and get my fair share of people wishing for Teleports. Often this is when im in the middle of a camp or on my way to one. I would like to help people but have to balance this with loosing a good camping spot. If Druids and Wizards were given a new line of spells that allowed us to Teleport ONE person at a time to the already preset teleport locals, this would allow us to help others travel and not severly interupt our fun. Mana cost should be the same for a group teleport as well as the casting time, but you can only send one person at a time. The use of the yes no box would keep people from being cruel and sending someone where they dont want to go. Also they would have to be grouped. This spell would no more interupt game play now then the current teleports could. Its not abuseable, that I can see. Of course the alter plane spells could NOT be used this way.<P>This idea alone would could do all that was orignaly suggested with out the abuse alternate bind spots could introduce.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Miraquai,<P>I am not looking for "everything easy" and I said I liked the risk factor - BUT I believe there has to be a line drawn.  Can you imagine a bunch of lvl 35's or lower being ported to the Fire Giants?  The will have NO HOPE of a corpse recovery.  Currently if someone runs into a dangerous spot chances are they can run in and grab their corpse with a little help.  I would not like see someone stranded - very possibly with NO IDEA where there corpse other than a zone name and the monster that killed them.  The only Viable soultion would be to find a high level Necro to summon their corpse - and if they cant get a port now what are the realistic chances of them getting a Necro to help.<P>I would be happy just to see the "Teleport Other" idea introduced since it would cover half the problems we face although it would still not make us more "group friendly."<P>Pluton</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I have only put a little thought into the Porting issue but I tend to like the solo "recall to where I ported from" spell. This way the wizard can return to his group after depositing someone at another location or even after going and picking up supplies (Jaspers) for the clerics and himself.<P>The real reason I decided to respond is that there is another related issue that I think could be greatly improved by simple modification... The act of binding someone.  I don't propose that any changes be made to where we can bind others but how, currently the person needing bound must be a member of your group, if that restriction could be removed and a dialog put up saying "do you want to be bound here? yes/no" it would make life simpler.  I can not think of any exploit that this would create off hand.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I like the idea about the 2 bind points but i don't think it will be activated. It can be misused...<P>Giving the wizard an extra spell called hold portal or some thing like that, that will create a gate way for those who seeking a portal to the location the ppl need to get to. it will gate all but the caster it self to the point the asked for. or it will create a gate (like in diablo) a blue 2d thing that when walked through will gate you.<BR>it will only gate the people who are in the party of the caster!!! so no hidden or other scum can follow. giving this spell at like lvl 20 or 30 isn't that much asked ... hell i don't even know when you wizards get that gate spell me only a rogue  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum10&number=10&thisthread=005391&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum10&number=10&thisthread=005391&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
