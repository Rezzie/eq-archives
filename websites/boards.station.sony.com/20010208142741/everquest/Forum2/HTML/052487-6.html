</FONT><HR>While I realize that faction in Velious is key to it's creation and existance, I have logged over 200 ice giant kills and am still threateningly to dragons.  I am now Kindly concidered by the Coldain without doing any quests in Thurgadin but have yet to bump up my faction one point with the dragons.  There are no quests, that I have found, outside of Skyshrine to raise dragon faction and it's really becoming disheartening to sit there at 51st level and kill green ice giants for a faction I don't seem to be able to raise.<P>Would it be possible to add more quests outside of Skyshrine to raise dragon faction?<P>Otherwise I am loving Velious.  The huge zones with very cool creatures is great.  The only thing I don't like is the insurpassable faction issues.

</FONT><HR>Here is my issue.<P>Great gear that is too easy to get.<P>Example: Berserker's Sword. It’s too common. Yakesha, EBW level weapon that every level 12 player who scrapes up 200pp through begging, selling cultural smithing items(low level, very rare, sells for tons considering the risk), and scavenging off unlooted kills. You don't often see a level 15+ char these days that doesn't have what used to be level 30+ or even level 45+ gear.<P>The reason this is an issue for me is not that it destroys the economy (which it does), but that it makes it too easy for those characters to kill mobs with too little risk. It only serves to further crowd the high level game, and crowd it with increasingly less skilled players. These guys just didn't go through the learning curve, and often don’t even know more than 5 or 6 zones. The increasing ease of killing mobs and leveling also robs them of the low level game, which is arguably EQ at it's best.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE investigate Beyond these folks saying PoG drops are easy and dropping like rain from the sky.  <P>THE ONLY CONCLUSION I CAN REACH IS THAT THESE ARE ALL UBER GUILDS WHO HAVE WIPED THE ZONE AND NOW THEY HAVE THEIRS, THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE NO ONE ELSE EVER GETS IT!<P>I am VERY serious, this is highly disturbing.  I am beginning to wonder if half these folks aren't just jumping on the bandwagon without even being there.  I play my cleric in POG and I still have not one single thing from POG.  6 total zone ins to PoG & NOT ONE THING, not even a spell for gods sake.  Where the hell are all these fantastic drops these guys claim are practically spawning on the ground?  They aren't there, thats where.  <P>Maybe for these "proffesional" gamers the break in and control of the zone is easy.  But for normal people this place is hard to do.  Almost every time we go up we have problems and end up with at least one CR.  And this isn't one group of UBER equipped guys, this is multiple groups trying to coordinate and using all the resources we have available.  Please don't punish normal players just because the guys that spend 18 hours a day playing say they've got theirs now nerf the F'ing zone before th n00bs get theirs.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ABASHI, please take the time to read this...  (yes, that was a shameless attention getting ploy)<P>Level 60 enchanter here from one of the 'uber guilds' on my server.<P>I love Velious, or at least the idea of it.  Many people have covered the same ground so I won't go over it again.  I do however want to make certain points.<P>Velious has many wonderful things, however the faction idea is a great idea gone wrong.  Currently, there is a circular problem.  Most of the stuff for higher levels requires guild raids to achieve.  Guild raids happen on the mobs that drop the loot people want, either for quests or as drops.  Currently in Velious on the upper scale there is no good reason to choose any faction to ally with other than Giant.<P>Giants currently give the best (read that as nice reward plus actually doable) quests.  It's obvious that the quests for Dragon faction are not finished.  The higher end quests for dwarf faction are not comprable either.<P>If you are in good with the giants you can kill dwarves AND dragons.  You can even kill the Dain and not be KoS to thurgadin dwarves if you desire (what's up with that?  Kill their king but that's okay?).<P>As you know if you are a high level player it's generally about the end game.  End game in Velious is Sleepers and you have to ruin your dragon faction to hunt there!<P>Temple of Veeshan has a good idea - hunt dragons in the test area.  Problem with that is the test area is a nightmare.  Far, far too difficult to fight in (pathing and aggro is just awful) for the rewards.<P>No dropped armor for Rangers/Druids/Paladins and those of the other classes that don't want to kill in Growth.<P>Some really nice quests.  Kudos to the team on some of them.  The Eastern Wastes quests and the Iceclad Ocean quests are really neat and doable.  Armor quests are just out of whack.  The Kael quests are really neat as well.<P>Put in more quests with dragons (in both skyshrine and Western Wastes) and dwarves (especially high end ones with the Dain and his court) that are doable and have good rewards ala the Kael ones.<P>Velketor's in the Kobold area is a great zone.  Tough but doable and the exp is wonderful.  I wouldn't suggest changing that part.  The spiders up front do need a bit more loot  for that level crowd.<P>Siren's is just bad.  I WANT to like this zone.  Please, please fix it.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Skyshrine - I've been working on my faction here since the expansion has come out not killing dragon related mobs so I would not have to worry about bad faction hits. However after spending months doing quests such as the "Giant Warrior Helm" and slaying countless number of Giants I am unable to become non KOS to the Dragon Lord. I recommend you bump up the faction you get from doing the 'Giant Warrior Helm' quest, because after giving close to 100 helms to the guards one should be at least border line KOS to the Dragon Lord... Also the quest rewards suck for the faction needed to complete them! As a monk I was expecting a hell of allot more then what is being reported from this zone with the amount of faction needed to complete them, not to mention the rarity of the components.<P>Sirens Grotto - Awesome dungeon, the break in however is a little to much. You need min two ubber groups to even attempt it. I would recommend lowering the first three mobs to at least level 50 so that one group can do this. The succor trick will however allow you to by pass the whole dungeon which IMO is lame.<P>Kael - This zone sucks from the stand point of risk/reward. Killing thousands of giants that con all the way to RED at 58 result in very poor loot and XP. At least up the loot a tad and perhaps the XP, its no fun spending six hours on a raid and end up with nothing but mid level items and if your lucky a single blue bubble of XP.<P>Wakening Lands - IMO keep the dragon where it is. Hes not up all the time and when he is up he makes the zone that much harder not to mention he drops good loot. Also if people really where worried about him its simple to gain the needed faction for him.<P>Cobalt Scar - Good zone don't touch it!<BR>Ice Clad - Needs more monsters near the zone in from North Ro, other than that its well done. The Snow dervs by the gate add spice and should stay. Don't nerf the Cougars making them weaker as they drop good loot.<P>Dragon Necropolis - Great zone, though I would like you to fix the stacking spiders. Sucks when you get a dozen in one stack and you try to pull em, talk about death in one round.<P>I will say that all in all the only thing missing are a few more zones like Sebilis/Chardok like dungeons for mid to high 50's. Perhaps that will be coming in the near future.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have been in Velious for about 6 levels now and really love hunting here.  The scenery is absolutely beautiful in most zones (at least the limited zones that I have seen).  Miscon is definitely a problem...nothing like getting smacked around by a greenie as if it were red to you.  But as far as risk/reward goes, I think alot is in balance.  Definitely goes along with the Verant philosophy of grouping...good luck fighting solo here. <P>One main problem I have noticed is the de-pop/respawn/aggro problem.  I have noticed this alot with tizmak, kodiaks, and wurms in Great Divide.  We often times have something walking away from us with low hitpoints (almost dead) when it disappears and respawns at it's original spawn location.  Then the MOB automatically aggros again.  Only this time, he brings buddies that have subsequently spawned near and around his original spawn /loc when he aggros, and we have to fight through a train or /shout TRAIN TO FALLS...and zone  Not much fun, and a pain in the arse to those sitting at the falls.  <P>That's my main complaint so far...then again...with such limited experience in other zones....I can't speak for Velious as a whole.  <P>Velious is far better than Kunark and the Old World...even if for the sheer aspect of the way the game looks.  Armor, scenery, and MOBs...everything looks better!  I am excited again about leveling and seeing other parts of this new-found area of Norrath!<P>Szago Litesavior<BR>41st Season Shaman<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've played a lot in kael and some other zones "velk, tuga..." but I think the mob has too much MR. That makes me nothing more than a bad warrior "I'm a lvl 60 bard". <P>Also, most of the mobs has too much HP and they hit too hard so you have to have a warrior and cleric with you at all times in those zones. Enchanter does not help that much either. The reward for this is not that good loot... why bother.<P>If I was a warrior or cleric I might play in SoV but I havent been there in like 6 weeks now... just not fun to be a lousy lvl 60 bard. <P>I will most likely stay away from SoV in the future too. <P>Maybe not the answer you wanted to hear  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>General SOV comments.<P>The mobs hit harder and have what seems like twice the hps of a Kunark/Norrath mob of equal cons. I spent over a month in SOV and earned maybe a bubble worth of exp. I went back to Kunark and spent time in Karnors/Seb(Mainly Karnors) and earned a level and a half in 9 days. This is something that really needs to be looked into. Especially givent the difficulty of the SOV mobs.<P>The high MR/Resists of the SOV mobs is out of control. Enchanters are hard to come by and been delegated to buffers in most zones. Blasters casters are having high resist rates as well. I play a warrior, but this indirectly affects me, as well as my guild performance in these zones. This needs to be addressed as well.<P>The "pick your poison" faction system really sucks. You design zones for raiding partys and make it so guilds will be divided on what they want to kill. Druids/rangers wont kill in POG for fear they will be KOS in Kelethin. Druids/Wizards want dragon faction so they can port to zones where a dragon is present at the ring. Can't raid Dain as some want to keep their coldain faction up. I could go on, but I think you get the point. <P>Greens attacking you. This is just plain annoying and another one of your time sinks. If it has a chance of killing me then it had better give me exp. If it is a green with no chance in hell of killing me then it shouldn't attack me. I guess this falls under the snow dervish at the iceclad dragon ring issue.<P>The only zone I have seen so far that has issues that should be addressed is Velk's Lab. The castle area has abnormal aggro ranges and you get adds that you shouldn't and wouldn't nromally get anywhere else in the game that I have been. This on top of the high resist making most mobs unmezzable, really takes the fun factor out of this area. The entrance to the kobold area is assinine "SP?". Debuff everybody and expect them to clear a room with 2 blue kobolds that fight like red mobs. Hitting for near 200 and no chance of messing/rooting due to the debuffing of the room. At the same time the kobolds keep their buffs. Huh? I lose my buffs due to the trap there, so had the damn kobolds. This makes that trap look like nothing more than another time sink. Haven't you learned yet that players hate time sinks? The exp/loot in this zone is also a joke for the difficulty of it. Other than that this is a great zone. Beef up the exp and the loot and give people a reason to experience it.<P>I think a lot of time and effort went into the designing of these zones. SOV is a great place to hang out and have fun. Just wish the EXP/Loot followed suit.<P>Denkoo Thunderspirit {Isengard}<BR>Saryrn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'd have to give thumbs down to SoV.<P>I explored there the first 2 weeks it was released and haven't ever gone back.  Went back to lower guk and it was geez these frogs are easy!  (and con the same too).  Kunark was inbetween, but it wasn't so far out of whack.  In the old world, after 35, you pretty much had to go to sol b, lower guk, or oot.  Kunark added great outdoor areas all the way to 50.  Skyfire is nice, but mostly just hunted for spells. Skyshrine was nice before it was nerfed.  The drops made the lack of exp worthwhile.  I hear dragon necropolis is a nice place for exp for the higher levels, but have yet to see it.  It's too remote for pickup groups.  What sane melee would run all the way there and shout, "58 warrior lfg".  No bind points that I know of.  The 50-60 pickup crowd is back in Seblis and Karnor's castle.<P>As everyone else has said, the insane MR, unmezzablility, insane hp, low exp, and undercon make SoV a joke.  Only reason to go is to raid for nice equipment and to see the nice senary.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bought Velious, went to the first couple of outdoor zones, everything conned green.  Found out that you need lots of people to get anywhere else, havnt been back since.<BR>Velious offers a lot for people 35-50 in the way of just getting exp, but after that, its useless unless you have huge groupes of people.  For those who are unguilded or dont have 5+ hours a day to play, and who are lev 50+, Velious is worthless.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
