</FONT><HR>=I do not make threats. *sigh* ever since Sony bought Verant and we got fired they'll hire anyone. I'm am done discussing this for now=<P>If this guy's complaint is actually true, then it would seem that he was either employed, or contracted, by Verant and got fired.<P>Having dealt with a number of these kinds of situations before, I can say that in my experience that what you see on the surface is *generally* the tip of an iceburg.  The way it usually swings is that disgrunted ex-employee thinks that, by virtue of his old employment status, he has a hotline to current employees.  There is, therefore, quite often a history of disgruntled ex-employee sending in embittered complaint emails about any current staff who happens to tick them off.  If that tactic fails, and it generally does, they try the innocent public approach where they KNOW that the company can't tell the public just what they were fired for and how much of a pain in the arse they've been in private since.<P>So, what i'm saying is this guy could be a well known malcontent who has stirred behind the scenes out of petty vengence for losing his job.  He could have petitioned that GM on multiple occasions for all kinds of things..we don't know.  The GM MAY be on instruction to suspend the guy if he makes trouble one more time..again, we wouldn't know and Verant wouldn't be able to say.<P>Basically, when you are dealing with someone who has been fired from the very company they are complaining about, things are RARELY as simple as portrayed.  Moreover that employee will, quite frequently, make good use of the confidentiality clauses any company is bound by.<P>I wonder if my synopsis sounds at all familiar to the poster.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hey OM... never fear... I'm here!<P>I actually do have this to add to the 'warning' I got.<P>Donold Mailed me back to say that although it was not HIS interpretation of a 'threat' in my post... he could see it was pure comedy... the wording in it is VIOLENT. It DOES break the RULE OF CONDUCT.<P>And therefore the POLICY must be upheld.<P>On that same note... it's not about a power-tripping GM - but that the ALLEGATION of a 'threat' the 'impersonating an emplyee' and whatever else could be seen as POLICY breaking, would leave a GM no choice but to act.<P>Donold had to act on my posts, and warned me.<P>Colla had already had the warnings but not the 'mental ability' to think about things, clearly he a rash and unthinking, in that he grabbed and run. <P>People in a state of fear or adreneline act instinctively, according to thier persona.<P>Some ppl will cowar in a corner when a house is burning, waiting to be rescued, some will run into the house to save that person, some will 'loot' that house while it's vunerable.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>ALL are acting on instinct and are in the 'zone' and thier instinct is drawn from, as Tyron said, either thier upbringing or thier frame of mind.<P>Colla either acted on adreneline, seeing it fallen, grabbed and ran, or he had 'coldy' calculated that someone such as Jumlace would not realise that extra space was needed. <BR>If Jumlace had, well he still had the 5300pp, otherwise it would be tried again.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Easy for any of us to prey on someone like Jumlace after speaking to him for just aminute<P>Jumlace says, 'Hail' ROFLMAO (OMG it still creates a belly laugh)  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>In Conclusion once again, Colla's attitude and actions as detrmined by his persona, lead him to BREAK the rules of the POLICY, many a time.<P>Someone who just DOES NOT get it, has no place in OUR world.<BR>Niether does someone who DOES UNDERSTAND but calculates thier moves.<P>I was IGNORANT of the RULES and broke them. (well I was ignorant that the rules existed also on these messge boards as well as in game.<BR>Colla  KNEW the RULEs and broke them.<P>GAME OVER.<P>By The Way guys I realised that we had been jipping Colla for not responding and wondering why - after TWO FULL threads he'd not posted any defence.<BR>Well he's banned... and you need an account I believe to post here. heh heh<BR> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>If we want to hear from Colla maybe we need to challenge him and take him to Everlore or somewhere. <P>But I don't think anyone cares much what he has to say, he's admitted enough.<P>P.S. You guys on this post do a search for the other THREADS.. although much the same as this, there is some CLASSIC comedy there that can't be missed by Yostari, Om, BeckyDruid, Tyronix and MySelf. I hope Yostari finds this thread, he said he had some nice stories starring the revered Jumlace 'Hail'.

</FONT><HR>OK here's my take on these 'trade-scams'.  If you agree to sell something to someone and then it falls out of thier inventory, pick it up and give it to them again.  So they were stupid and made a mistake.  You still agreed to sell it to them.  If a passerby picks it up and walks away with it, then that's what they get and there's not much you can do about it (Verants own policy - items on the ground are open to all).  I myself have found items on the ground and picked them up, although they were out in the middle nowhere and nobody was around.  I've also dropped my weapon many times (click on the inventory screen and it drops right through for some reason).  The problem with Wurmslayer is Verants fault and they are the only ones who should be held accountable for it.  But If you sell something to someone and then take it back from them (no matter how it happens), then you are scamming.  The person in this example (true or not) knew axactly what he was doing.  He was dishonest and dishonorable.  Players like this ruin the game for everyone else.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

They have added coding that causes NPC's to quickly come pick up valuable items on the ground, some items will drop through the world, etc.. and in response to people complaining Abashi himself said "You should not drop anything on the ground that you wish to keep. if someone sees and item on the ground they may pick it up."<P>If they won't compensate someone for losing their epic because they didn't have an open inventory slot, then why the hell should some idiot get compensated for a trade that HE screwed up?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well first off, you could have avoided this by just telling the guy he dropped his wurmslayer, and if he still lost it then it would be his fault and they wouldnt be able to do anything to you.  However you picked it up and took it for yourself even though you knew whose it was.  That really was the part you made your mistake.  Should you be banned for it?  No, if the other guy didnt send you a message and you were willing to give back the guy the wurmslayer or his money then you shouldnt have been banned.  However posting on the boards isnt going to help.  Try email Thom Terrazzas or George Scotto or even John Smedley.  If your really resourceful you can get their direct phone numbers and call them.  Discussing problems like this instead of email does help a lot.

</FONT><HR>/em laughs quite loudly.<P>This all brings back fond memories of an old game called Neverwinter Nights.  (Not the new one on the way out, but hte one made for online gaming for AOL by SSI many, many years ago.)<P>In that game, trading items was done on a trust basis.  You just highlighted the item you wanted to trade, then hit the Give command and highlighted the person you wanted to give it too and hope they gave you what you wanted.  For the most part of the game, there weren't any problems with this... trust was high...<P>But then a guild was dedicated to 'thieving' items from people, or scamming as it's called in EQ.  We did it by ROLEPLAYING (everyone had to have thief as one of their classes at least -- D&D multi-class rules) and getting gullible people to send their item/money first.  We'd then record it and post a list of what loot we had gathered and each item had a value given to it.  These values were added up and we had a huge ranking list.  It was a blast...<P>Too bad we can't do that here... it was SO much fun.  And most often we would turn around and give these items to true newbs that could really use them, after taking them from 'farmers'.<P>The guild we created was called the Spirit Lurkers.  It was quite an interesting bunch of friends.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I guess you were never a newbie either, right?  I always keep an inventory slot open now anyway, just out of habit.  I have never owned WS, but I don't like to take chances.  I have still dropped my weapons constatly when switching or trading.  Mostly due to poor coding of the inventory slots (if you create "hot-buttons" for inventory slots, you can click on the edges of the boxes and the item you are holding will pass right through the box and onto the ground.  I have learned to live with it because I use it to swap weapons quickly between DW 1Handers and 2HS, a trick I learned while playing my bard.)  I would never just take a weapon from someone like that.  You can try to justify it all you want, but it's still stealing.

That act, imho, was reason to suspend him if for nothing else being arrogant because he's played for soo long. Pls.<P>The GM expected submissive behavior from the offending player and when it was not forth coming, he suspended him. That was pretty clear since how can a player in virtual reality realistically threaten the GM. If there's no method there can be no act, only misperception. The only action available to the player in RL through the published appeal policies or through the courts.<P>Frankly, I think the guy deserved to be suspended and forced to donate the sword to the buyer for making him chase him down. I think his guild out to  toss him out, if they're a player-friendly one that is. But most of all what I think is that Jumlace has got to have the biggest, brassiest pair I've ever seen to keep asking the guy to sell him the Wurmslayer.

</FONT><HR>Well, folks, I'm a pretty moral person, but I'd have to go toward the side of picking it back up and saying the hell with it.<P>Let me try it this way.  This fellow said that you needed a primary slot free because it won't fit in any bags.  Moron buys it without a primary slot free, it lands at his feet.<P>Now, if the scammer grabs it and runs, I'd call that bad, and I can see a ban for that maybe.  If the moron wanders off, content with his wurmslayer, pick it up and head your way.<P>Once it hits the floor, it's fair game.  I don't care if I just sold it.  Hell, I can sell it to you a dozen times if you give it back to me and are willing to buy it yet again(stupid, but just an example), and I can pick up several wurmslayers that I find lying around in a zone(as if!), but having both happen is a bannable offense?<P>P.T. Barnum covered this adequately with "There is a sucker born every minute."  Warned about tne need for a primary slot, he gives money and offers to trade.  Plunk.  Yep, Barnum's got it right.  Now, I admit I'd be willing to offer it to him a second time, but if it hit the ground a second time?  Feh.  He just paid me to put up with him.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I mean, how long could ANYBODY leave a wurmslayer on the ground for?

Damned if I'll leave it to decay or have someone else pick it up!  I'll keep it from decaying.  If you can't give me a tell within two minutes asking if I have it, see you!<P>Granted, there's a lot of info we're lacking here, like maybe how the scammer-guy told the buyer to piss off after he grabbed the just-dropped slayer and ran for the zone, but who knows...<P>Then again, he **REALLY** should have had a slot free.

</FONT><HR>The point a few of you are missing is that this person was not banned for trade-scamming. This person was banned for having excessive flags on the account. In Real Life, they have this 3 strikes and yer out thing going. The same idea is also applied to Everquest. Colla was SUSPENDED by the GM(who was not on a power trip) for openly hostile reactions for being summoned for its offense. The Lead GM, who has final say, reviewed the entire chain of events and discovered these multiple flags(warnings if you must) on that persons account. In the Lead GM's opinion(issued much like a Judge in Court), the evidence suggested a lack of remorse and a willingness to try the same stunt again. As such, the only reasonable recourse he had was to issue a Ban on that account. In my humble opinion(which may be debated fiercly), the Lead GM fulfilled his responsibilities to the letter of the policies put in place by Verant. There could be no other decision made in this matter.

</FONT><HR>Hi, its BeckyDruid!  I have to use our EQ station ID to post on this board, so alas my husbands dumb handle automatically appears here.<P>Anyway, I'm glad to see there are more people on this board who agree that the GM in this case totally overreacted.  Yeah, I agree this Colla character is a royal jerk.. but jeez, we are customers of this service and have the right to complain when we feel we are being treated unfairly.  <P>Oh yeah and the "say goodbye if you wish" comment.. total power trip!!<P>Becky aka BeckyDruid aka Lanya on Mith Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061517-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061517.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061517-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061517-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061517-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=061517&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=061517&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
