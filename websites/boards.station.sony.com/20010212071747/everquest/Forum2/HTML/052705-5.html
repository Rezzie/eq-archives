</FONT><HR>The dot-pet solution is pretty weak and made more weak because you're relying on it as a crutch for SEVERAL of the classes.  Obviously if the higher level encounters were designed for the classes in the game, then every class would have a role, especially in epic encounters.  That doesn't mean every class would be essential, just that it would have a role.<P>For instance, Vox having 2-3 minor dragons at the side that had to be managed at the same time allows those minor dragons to be managed by secondary or tertiary teams led by an enchanter.  (This brings up lag issues etc., but I think you get my point.)  The problem with the Velious encounters is that your designers used crutches that eliminated class usefulness.  Take those crutches away (tell them to FIX it) and see what they come up with.<P>Designers WILL rely on crutches unless you tell them NOT to.  Don't let them. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, I read Absor's recap and I must say that  'Illusions changes and tweaking of certain spells' are NOT what is needed to balance enchanters. If you following many of the discussions taking place on the 3rd party sites I think you will find that many enchanters agree. Why these people will not post directly to this thread I will never understand. <P>I did find it somewhat disturbing that there is a 'pre-conceived VISION' of what IS and ISN'T going to be done to fix enchanters. This is evident by Absor's comments of "I do not beleive that enchanters should be able to do this" or "this will never happen but it is on the list". What is the point of having this discussion if it is all pre-decided? I think many many enchanters are put-off by this and refuse to post comments here, again as evidenced by discussions on many of the 3rd party sites. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The Essential Enchanter: We should look into why an enchanter is considered ‘essential’ in a Kunark group, and perhaps change that. <P><BR>Why would you nerf this? you said that EQ was a group game, do you want Enchanters sitting in the zone in looking for a group for hours?<P>Clerics are also Essensial in most Kunark zones, so are Warriors....<P>Some classes are not essencial and I would not consider enchanter that becuase bards can mez pretty well, ppl just want us becuase we make the group better, a bard can mez we can just do it better, but we are not essencial.  A paladin can tank, warriors can do it better.... necros btw can also mez for a short time..<P>Anyways instead of doing that did you think of myabe maken other classes more usefull.... btw enchanters can't really solo well so while they looking for grp they have to sit there unlike druids or necros or mages, they can at least solo while they wait....<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor wrote<BR>"Really, where the majority of higher level enchanters are expressing their concern is that there are too many creatures that are immune to mesmerization-type (and secondarily charm) spells. As I noted earlier, I’m not real sure that we can increase the functionality of those spells because they would simply over-balance the enchanter in those encounters (encounters where one or two very strong enemies are intended to challenge large groups, and one charm or mesmerization spell would eliminate all or half of the challenge)."<P>He earlier wrote (I can't fine the reference) <P>-If a puller pulled in 20 mobs and the chanter could mez 10, then he would be like 10 characters himself-<P>Well, this shows that Verant feels that mobs should be fought in certain ways. And if another way is possible, then they will program to make it impossible. Verant wants to FORCE certain ways of fighting certain mobs and certain zones. And anyone that can do it another way, it will either be programmed against or be an exploit. <P>Verant made chanter the Kings of Crowd Control. They did it with mez, charm, stun, and a number of other spells. Verant should design their zones to allow all of the use, maybe not a full use, of most of each class’s capabilities. Does that mean that the God, or Dragon, or Boss Mob for 55+ zones be mezed, charmed or stunned? No. But there are other mobs in a zone that should be controlled in these ways. If 3 mobs are pulled, then the chanter should be able to mez 2 of them. Otherwise, what is the difference between that and a group in LG pulling 5 stone skells and mezing them?<P>What do I me? Well, if you want to make it hard, then up the mobs hps, or make the spells tougher, but don’t say<P>-	Chanters would be too over powered in too allow them to mez or charm mobs in high-level areas. – <P>Verant wanted a class that could crowd control. They made it. They designed to do just that. Chanters job is to do crowd control. If you don’t want chanters to do crowd control, then you should not have given them the spells to do it. But you did, so let us use them. Remember, these spells have a good taunt factor. If a mez breaks when no other PC has attacked them, they will come to use prob kill us. If we charm a mob and it breaks, well then we will have 2 REALLY PISSED mobs coming at us, and will prob die in high level zones.<P>This goes for Wizards as well, they can’t hit the mobs either. If you didn’t want us to be what we are then you should not have made us. <P>As it is now, you are making at least 2 classes pretty useless in Velious, chanters and wizards. <P>Are you interested in making the zone challenging, but fun for all people or just some of them?<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I like the idea someone posted earlier of a spell to get our pet to aggro.  It doesn't make us a true pet class, as a true pet class could just tell their pet to do it.  But it does add some functionality to the pets that very few higher level characters ever use.<P>Also illusions should overwrite other illusions no matter the level.  As is you can over right an illusion only if you use a higher level one.<P>Also to make enchanters a little more mana efficent how about extending some of our buffs to include the whole group? (Talking adding seperate spells not changing exsisting ones.)  For instance:<P>-Group Breeze - Say level 24 or so, would be nice for those coming up in the ranks, or perhaps give it at 29 so it can become a stop-gap while we try to get mana to Clarity whole group.<P>-Group Cload/Haze/Etc. - These are far from the best armor buffs there are, but if the group lacks someone with better shielding spells it could be nice.<P>-Group Augmentation - After 29 Aug. becomes very sought after by tanks.  It does however eat mana.  A group version that would be more mana efficent would be nice.  Make it a level 39 or so.<P>-Group Invis/See Invis - Would be very helpful in getting a group ready to travel.<P>Other things I'd like to see:  Some lower level quest robes.  As far as I know there are no robes that can be quested for by lower level enchanters (say 40 and below).  Spell additions I'd like to see:<BR>-Illusion: Giant - make us look like a giant native to the region (sand, hill, forest, etc.)  If giants don't live in the area (i.e. such a graphic isn't present in zone textures) then it can't be used there.  Inccidental effects could be increase in strength and resistance to charms and stuns.  Make it level 49 or so.<P>-Illusion: Drake - turns us into a Drake.  Would be a rather unique look.  Inccidental effects could be levitation and increased resistance to fire/cold.  Make it level 39 or so.<P>-Group Illusions - Group affecting versions of the elemental and minor illusions.<P>-Animate Golem - A pet spell that animates an iron figurine (made with blacksmithing).  It would be big and slow, but would follow commands.  Make it a level 60 spell (you'd think after all that time we'd figure out how to refine the magic enough to command a pet).<P><BR>The taunt that come with most (if not all) enchanter spells should be examined.  A wizard and I can be nuking a mob for all we're worth, the wizard does more damage but the mob would rather attack me.  Is this intentional?<P>Sorry for the disjointed nature of this post but I'm in a bit off a rush.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A point about religion and enchanters.  I started a human enchanter with a group of friends.  Our goal was to play as a group.  My problem?  In order to start in Qeynos, i had to choose Karana as a god.  (Human agnostics can only start in Freeport, at least when I started).<P>This alone put me on horrific terms with the guards outside Neriak.  Neriak is very important to enchanters.  All of the jewelry related spells are there, and several of the vital Enchanter quests involve Neriak.<P>In addition, killing the green orcs in East and West Commons gives bad faction to the Indigo Brotherhood.  I can understand why the blue orcs might have this faction (Ambassador D'Vinn in Crushbone), but there is no explaination for why the green orcs would have the same faction.<P>The corresponding problem here is that all quests that improve faction in Neriak are IN Neriak, with one exception (Evil Research).  But having a religion pretty much eliminates ever being able to do that quest.<P>In spite of all this, I was relatively safe around the dark elf guards because of invisibility.  Since the newbie guards were 'enhanced' to prevent people camping the guards, most of the guards are totally immune to all magic, and automatically see through invisibility and Illusions!  Since this change was put in, Mendel has died many, many times in Nec Forest.  I cannot approach the city gates safely with any means.  I have given up trying to get the Tashania spell.  (suggestion - remove the No Drop restriction from the spell or the quest coins).<P>A single decision made at the character's inception should not have such a long lasting, immutable effect.   Mendel did not put bonus points into Intelligence, but I have gear and spells that compensate for that.  Other creation decisions CAN be changed, except the religion.<P>If the religion is not changed via illusions, then please make alternative ways to improve some of the evil factions without having to go deep into their city in order to do so.<P>Mendel<BR>Rodcet Nife<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Illusions:<BR>If you were to remove Skeleton illusions and/or Wolf Illusions from the line of Enchanter spells, then I'd hope that you only removed the spell scrolls so that people who already have it in their books won't suddenly 'forget' something that they used to know.<P>On the other hand...  I might not mind losing my skeleton/wolf illusions so much if I were compensated with some group illusions.  It would be neat to change my whole group into Gnomes.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>High Level Encounters:<BR>I guess the root of the problem with High level encounters is that Enchanter spells are all magic based.  Perhaps we can get a line of post-50 spells that are based on other types of magic?  Or maybe we can finally get a pet that 'listens' post-50?  Heck, even Druids get a pet that listens, you'd think that Enchanters would learn something from their 50+ levels of pet experience.<P>More on pets:<BR>I'd like it if my pet would 'wear' the armor that I handed to him.  I honestly don't know if his AC goes up now when I hand him armor, but it would be really cool just to see him equip the breastplate that I just handed him.<P>Glimlering Glimmerstone of E'ci<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>All,<P>I wanted to comment on the Mask of Faith idea.<P>There is currently no explanation for why NPCs can detect played religion. So, I was thinking that maybe a very TINY tatoo or glyph could be added to the forehead of players. That way, it could be explained why NPCs know your religion.<P>Then, make Mask of Faith work. There is no reason an enchanter shouldnt be able to appear to be a normal member of the race he changes into, including the religion tatoo/glyph most commonly associated with the race. Even a specific stackable spell to change JUST the religion tatoo would ne nice.<P>The religion tatoo would explain why NPCs know people's religion, and it would allow enchanters to get around it. They should be able to in my opinion.<P>HOWEVER, I think we also need a reason for people to follow a god.<P>What if ANY player of any class had a small spell list (say every 10 levels they get 1 spell) they could cast just for following that god, over and above anything else they can do? If you give balanced spells, it would give players a reason to follow a god. The spells dont even have to be different really, it could simply be the same list for all gods, with minor effect differences. NO MANA should be required, just a 10 minute (or other) recast time. I am not suited to exact balance details.<P>AGNOSTICS would not get these spells, their faction benefit would be their boon.<P>Example religious spells:<P>1) Word Of Recall. Set this one to be a level 40+ spell. Or it could be level 20 or 30 or whatever you deem best. It would let the player that followed that religion "gate" to the church he follows from his own hometown. So, a human follower of Innoruuk could always cast "Word of Recall" and appear in the Freeport Sewers adjacent to an evil cleric there. A Dark elf of Innoruuk would appear in that weird chapel in 3rd gate, and a human follower of Rodcet Nife would appear in the UFO building. No mana used, but a high recast time (10 mins, 30 mins, or whatnot).<P>2) Aura of Faith. A level 1 ability that is equal to the starting INT caster level 1 shield. Nothing major. No mana to cast, the duration is half the recast time.<P>3) Prayer. A level 10 ability that will summon you 1 food, or 1 water, depending on what you need. Or, it could summon one bandage if you are hurt below 50%.<P>4) Chant of Faith. A high level ability with a long recast that casts a 2 point MR increase or something.<P>5) Friend of the Faithful. A spell that ups your faction one rank with members of your own religion for 5 minutes. 30 minute recast.<P>These are just ideas. They may be too useful to balance against agnosticism. BUT the general idea is sound, I think. They could be toned up or down.<P>What do you think?<P>AnimatedU<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

You dont regen mana and faster with it on (test it yourself if you disagree).

</FONT><HR>As a level 60 enchanter please DO NOT make the different mesmerisation spells stack. It works fine the way it is.<P>I think you may have a lot of imput from level 54 and lower enchanters. Anyone that complains about reoccuring amnesia hasn't been using Memory Flux that has little to no chance at working. So we don't "see" it recur - but it sure works MUCH better than it's level 55 upgrade. Pls leave Reoccuring as it is and instead fix Memory Flux.<P>Please don't change the religion aspect. I follow Karana and I have managed to make myself amiable in Neriak, so it CAN be done. All these things are great challenges for a dedicated enchanter, please don't take them away.<P>You know, I have long thought one of the secrets of success to EverQuest was the difficulty of obtaining growth, whether in the form of exp or items. It keeps people rivetted to want to obtain that next goal. Lately, all that has been done is add faster weapons (things that die faster give exp faster) better items, and also a whole revamp of the experience system. Please do not make things just too easy and leave out all the challenges that make the game so much fun.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I don't know why I expected a fair shake for enchanters with this thread.  Verant does not like us because we alter the pacing of the game.  We have more control over down-time than any other class and that is a scary thing for them. Our representative is a self acknowledged NON-ENCHANTER player and has apparently bought into the hype that we are uber-powerful.   So how do you make us pay for that ability?<P>1) Death.  We die horrificly.  Alot.  Enchanters not only have to worry about mobs, but we have to train the groups that we are in to work with us.  All it takes is one tank not to use the /assist command and we get pulverized.<P>2) Resists.  It seems that all our spells make mobs incredibly PO'd.  So a resisted mez or charm and we start getting hammered.  Clerical heals do not even taunt these mobs off us. <P>3) Incredibly low HP and AC.  Our hp and AC are very low, thus if #1 or #2 happens, we better pray that our flux is not resisted or that a tank or cleric can save our hineys till our spells refresh and we can cast again.<P>4) Grouping.  It is very easy to get a group if there are no other enchanters about or no bards about.  For dungeon zones we are wanted, but only one per group.  For outdoor zones, people would prefer to just pay us for a quick clarity and shove us along our way.  So while grouping is easier for us than some others, it is only under specific circumstances.<P>5) Class abilities are spread out a bit more now.  You've given bards a diluted but still strong way to do Crowd controll AND mana regen AND haste.  You've given necros the ability to mez for some wierd reason.  (NOT A SLAM OR A CALL TO NERF FOR EITHER OF THOSE CLASSES!!!!)<BR>So for the most part a bard is just as viable to a group as the enchanter, they will happily take either one and some prefer the bard to fill our role.<P>OUR BENIFITS:<P>1)  We reduce the downtime of our party, both in mana regen and in reducing damage taken.<P>2)  We are a last ditch effort to control a situation that will most definitly kill the party otherwise.<P>3)  We have the ability to obtain the most powerful pets in the game for a short amount of random time. (Yes they beat us to a bloody pulp later, but it is still powerful while it lasts)<P>4)  We have some very usefull buffs, damage absorption shileds, speed, slow debuffs, etc.<P>That about sums it up.  Now compare the two, we are powerful, very powerful....with a group.  Think about this.<P>1) what good are speed buffs, damage shields, and debuffs if we are alone?  Please don't say you can use them on the pet, that is not even funny.  It is cruel and unusual punishment to buff our pet and let it think its gona live through an encounter.<P>2)  You are alone and you mez out 3 mobs, hurray!..now what are you gonna do?  You charm one and it kills the other two, now what do you do with the charmed pet?  get off a mez and mem blur and run away.  Want to even guess how many times this scenario works?  And when it fail and you die, that erases all the ones that worked and puts you in the hole as far as exp gain goes.<P>3) want to try doing a dungeon solo? no snare, cant kill a mob quickly, one resist and your toast.  Well, at least you can invis and get your body back.  Unless you chose a dungeon that see's invis, then your hosed.<P>So you can pretty much conclude that all of this vaunted POWER doesn't mean squat if you don't have a group to use it on.  Now balance the need for a group, the power we bring to that group and the very large prices we pay in HP, AC, Deaths and resists.<P>And after all that you still think we need to be nerfed?  I think you need to go play an enchanter for about 40 levels so you know what in the blazes your talking about.  Here is a hint...target groups that have clerics in them so you can get a rez.<P>Matriach</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1)  Geting rid of myths:  Verant does not like to give other classes spells that will step on another classes usefulness or will cross class definition lines. This is a lie where enchanters are concerned. <P> Necromancers whined about not being able to stop other mobs when they screwed up a pull while soloing so Verant gave them screaming terror.  <P>Druids constantly whine about how their mana regeneration slows their ability to solo so verant gives them mana regeneration.<P>Numerous Items have enchanter spells attached to them (Chaotic Feedback, Tashani, Tashania, and many others).<P>Mages, Necromancers, and Shaman complained about their spells not sticking all of the time so Verant gave them the Maloise and Malaize line of spells, which are far more powerful then enchanters Tashan line. <P>They have now given every class the ability to cast illusions. (see the all/all items coming out of SoV).<P>2) Enchanters are the masters of crowd control: This does not apply to Scars of Velious, which is 99.99% of the reason why the dungeons are unused Velious.<P>3) Enchanters are the only class that is dependent on one class of spell(magic based spells).<P>Verant's answer to every problem with mob over utilization or exploit is to increase magic resistence, even though 99.99 % of the time enchanters are not envolved (read Necromancers and Druids).  <P>Enchanters need a second line of mesmerizations and stuns that are poison or disease based.<P>3)  Enchanters are the masters of charm:  Boltran's Agracie is an excellent charm, however it is capped at 53 and we desperately need a charm for up to 59. I fully understand and agree with the the reasons why boss and epic mobs are not charmable, however this should not include general unnamed mobs.  The cap for Boltran's Agracie should be increased to level 59 mobs.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It is still there waiting for mez to break, so it can run and hit the enchanter with no armor or AC! So to say that mezzing a mob "eliminates" the challenge is absolutely ludicrous.

</FONT><HR>Hello.  Lots of good posts here.<P>I am bored when I go to places like Kael.  Why even bring an enchanter?  We are good for buff sessions but once the fight starts I feel like dead weight.  I normally stand there picking my nose, hoping not to die.  We can not mez there, most of the mobs around the main encounter can't be charmed, and our damage spells are super resisted.  This is not only the case in Kael either.  I see us with many of the same complaints that Necros have during these encounters.<P>I suggest enchanters get a mana gift spell similiar to necros.  We are after all the masters of mana.  <P>Something like Gift of Thought.  A spell that is able to take 400 mana from us and give it to our target.  If we can't fight we might as well have something to do.  <P>I like the mask faith illusion.  I am not agnostic and have lots of problems because of this, especially on the epic quest.  I have been doing the crate quest in Qeynos for what seems to be eons.  Either that or make some nice quests that make my religion worth a damn.  I honeslty prefer the quests <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.  <P>As for not making enchanters essential, please take a look at the power of the bard mez.  I group with a bard quite often and he is resisted far less then me (especially in hate).  If not for my AE mez he would be more powerful.  I think 2 bards could do the job of on enchanter very easily. <P>Lately the class has had this illusion (pardon the pun) of being over powered.  This is simply due to dungeon set up.  This is what Dunar above is saying.  Verant has set up the popular dungeons like Sebilis with many weeker mobs.  The mezzing is good in there.  BUT, if you go to other zones where there are few mobs but their power is substantially higher we are pretty much worthless.<P>Hate to say it but most of my excitement during large encounters comes from setting up targetting hot keys to keep eveyone's clarity and haste up.  That is sad.<P>I don't think many clerics would be happy if they could only sit there and cast symbol and hero.  We need something else to do if you think mezzing is two powerful.  <P>If you will reconsider the mez idea then a short duration mez that is mana costly that can be used on the newly found giants of Velious would be outstanding.  Something where it would take 2 or 3 of us to keep one or 2 targets mezzed. <P>Except for the religion illusion, I think other illusions are a waste of time.  Who in there right mind cares if they have a different face?  What does that do?  It would strictly be a novelty, and we already have a ton of those.<P>Throw us some SoV funtionality.  That is what we need.  <P>Steffin Soulcharmer<BR>55 Beguiler<BR>Innoruuk Server<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is depressing reading all the good commentary and seeing Absor squash it into oblivion.  <P>I really hope that you take a look at what you consider to be 'unbalanced' about the enchanters, and look at how dangerous it is to use.  A 'general' nurf of the magnitude that happened on Rallos Zek turns a powerful but unpredictable class into a predictably unpowerful class.  Enchanters have never recovered on Rallos.  <P>I'll be one of the first to say - yes, enchanters have amazing power, yet they pay for that power often times with thier lives and experience.<P>Look at some other classes and see how powerful they are, and yet what do they pay for it...?<P>If you think that enchanters are unbalanced, please give some details as to what enchanter on what server leveled faster than anyone else by soloing mobs that were deep red because of x spell...  I really doubt that you can find such an instance.<P>I've heard of enchanters that have soloed spectre island in oasis.  Wow, you think, that is way overpowered.  Hmm... upon further inspection and questioning, you find out that they died 3 times in figuring out how to set it up, zoned 10 times, and had a good run twice before they died again.  Is that overpowered?  Maybe.  Is that balanced?  I think so - look at how often they died...<P>Why are enchanters considered essential in groups?  You were wanting to look into this and see if they were really essential, and maybe 'fix' that.  Actually - the majority of the calls I have seen are for "group looking for enchanter or bard - send tells"  Hmm... seems to me that bards and enchanters are fairly interchangeable.  Groups find them essential because of mana regen and haste spells - every group likes to be better.<P>Instead of 'nurfing' how essential enchanters are, why don't you figure out why some classes are considered non-essential, and fix that.<P>Honestly - in a lot of the high level zones (i.e. sebelis, chardok, etc)  I'm needed as an enchanter, on my toes, for the first 30 minutes of whatever we are doing.  After that, the puller almost always brings singles.  At that point, I can go afk for 20 minutes at a time without being missed aside from the occasional overpull and such.<P>Sorry with not being overly thrilled with your summation of enchanters, but I really hate to see my favorite class nurfed into oblivion simply because they are one of the more balanced classes out there.<P>Dariys<BR>56 Enchanter<BR>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>From someone who likes a challenge.<P>Enchanters are one of my favorite classes.  I like the playing a class that requires camera switching, fast targetting and good spell slot management to play well.  Given that, I feel that the enchanter should give up some power in the name of balance.<P>Illusions:<BR>I think that enchanters should lose the following illusions:<BR>Drybone<BR>Skeleton<BR>Spirit Wolf<BR>Tree<P>All of these fall into the realm of a different class.  It would be nice to recover the fire resist from dry bone and the cold resist on spirit wolf onto a different illusion (elementals perhaps?) but I don't feel that is needed for game balance.<P>I would be VERY VERY careful about targettable illusions.  It would be very easy to bypass faction restrictions using these.  Already a level 20 agnostic enchanter can go to every city on Norrath to sell and bank.  It would take every other class a lot of time building faction to do the same thing.  That ability is incredibly powerful.  The faction system is one of the more interesting and fun things about EQ.  Please don't let targettable illusions destroy it.<P>Finally, asking for spirit of wolf with illusion spirit wolf seems grossly unbalancing to me.  I would rather see the illusion removed than have spirit of wolf added.<P>Low level training spells:<BR>I don't feel that enchanters need a low level evocation spell.  Evocation is a skill that should be difficult for enchanters to learn.  Enchanters aren't generally thought of as great nukers.  There are 50+ enchanters who have almost no evocation skill.  However, if an enchanter chooses to work on evoke, I feel it should be a challenge to them to add, what I feel, is a very useful tool to the enchanter toolbox.  This is one of the things that balance enchanters.  Slow direct damage with a good chance of fizzle due to a low skill.  Asking for a low level training spell for evoke is like asking for 0 dam 15 delay weapons so melee classes can easily work up all their melee skills.  You have to choose what kind of enchanter you want to be.  If you want to be able to use direct damage, you have to work at it.<P>I feel the same way for conjuration.  Conjure is used primarily for the mesmerize series of spells.  This skill is very important for enchanters and some what difficult to raise.  Mesmerise costs 20 mana can can be cast every 4 seconds or so.  Another way to train conjure is to cast pendril's animation and then reclaim energy.  This costs much less mana but requires a tiny dagger (1sp) each time.  Personally, I think that a good enchanter can raise their conjure skill with the tools provided.  Enchanters are supposed to be a difficult class to play and I think this is one of the aspects to that.  Fizzling on a mez at a critical moment can spell doom for an entire party.  For my enchanter, that means a few hours spent at the guild working on skills for each level.  That is a small price to pay for a reduced chance of a fizzle at a critical moment.<P>Finally, there is one thing the enchanter class should have.  A group invis and see invis seems like a useful addition in tune with the theme of the enchanter.  It seems like that enchanters are one of the best classes at invisibility, however, druids get a group invis and enchanters do not.  No one, that I know of, gets a group see invisible.  I think that would be quite useful for moving a party through a dangerous area.  Perhaps a group invis and later a group invis?  This is mostly a convenience issue as invis is very very cheap to cast.<P>I'm looking forward to hearing more from the other contributors.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I hope I am not too late.<P>Illusions and Zoning:<P>Ok explain this from the reality of Norrath.  Magistar the Enchanter steps quietly inside the cave entrance to Neriak. Uttering an arcane phrase his form shimmers from that of the High elf to the shorter Dark elf.  Calmly he enters the histile domain under the auspices of brother in arms to the evil dark elves.  Then as he takes one more step through the cave, LOADING, PLEASE WAIT.   Magistar has entered Neriak succesfully.  He continues onward only to hear shouts for his hed as he meets the first dark skinned elf.<BR>Ok, so why is it that I lose my illusion cause I took a STEP, I walked forward?  Because EQ was designed using a zone system.  Thats the only reason.  There is no logical explanation really.  Your list even reflected that until someone OTHER than an enchanter complained about using their Mask.  Well, guess their mask is more important than this class.  I dont think its a balance issue, I just would like to be able to count on my illusions not fading due to a Technology system rather than balance/logical reasoning.<P>Please Alan rethink illusions on zoning, they shouldnt fade. SoW doesn't fade when zoning to somewhere you cant cast it (though DMF and Levitate do for balance reasons hmmmm) so why should illusions when it plainly is not due to power.<P>Magistar Mindmaster<BR>Povarian Enchanter<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>On the subject of pets...I personally feel you should leave OUR pets alone.  I know we'll never get pet commands for them and can accept it.  The enchanters that use them are trying to solo, which goes against everything an enchanter was created to do.  But what I personally would love is for OTHER pets to have a toggle for /defend.  In the same way that other pet classes can turn off taunt...I'd like it to be possible for them to turn off the pet's instinct to automatically defend his master and/or himself.  It would do more to balance the other classes more than enchanters to be honest.  At the present time I really prefer NOT to group with necros or mages...because I know that both of those classes rely on their pets for damage...and that I and many other enchanters consider innocent looking Jabober to be nothing more than a mezz breaker and enchanter killer.  Necromancers and Magicians both have reputations of being soloers...and alot of that is because they aren't effective in groups because they're discouraged from using their pets.  They're discouraged from using their pets because they break mezz.  <P>There are a couple different examples of this...first of which is while you're fighting and another mob wanders along.  It happens to attack the necro or the mage first (for some reason this happens alot, maybe because the caster is sitting, those lazy mages).  I begin to cast mezz while the pet instantaneously runs to the mob to engage it...even the best pet controller has problems with timing his /pet calm down brother command.  Basically, the only way I've found to work with pets is to stun BEFORE attempting to mezz...to give the player a chance to calm before I mezz.  That inconvenience over the course of several hours is not something I want to deal with, however, and so I basically order all necros and mages that I group with not to use pets period...and this cuts down on their effectiveness/grouping quality.  Without their pets, I would actually prefer not to group with necros and magicians at all, which I find disturbing since I have friends and guildmates that play these classes.  <P>The second example of my pet anxiety is when...you've gotten the target mezz'd and gotten the pet off the target.  The pet has been pulled off the target to be mezz'd and goes back to the target the rest of the group is fighting...and then the target is killed.  It's known that both mezz, and tash which I've already cast on the mezz'd mob...are both highly taunting spells (and slow also if there isn't a shaman around to cast it, this increases my hate with the mob even further).  It's customary for tanks to taunt 2, 3+ times before breaking the mezz...but the pet that was attacking that mezz'd creature has no patience and a good memory, so as soon as the first mob is killed he runs straight to the second one and immediately engages it, breaking mezz, sending the mob directly to poor little me;x  <P>All of this could be avoided if there was some way to make the pet just stand there when his master...or even when the pet itself was being attacked.  This wouldn't be a "nerf" because it would be something that could be toggled, just like the /pet taunt on/off command.  If this were possible, and if it worked correctly...then I would definately want these classes in my dungeon groups.  It would change the perception of these pets from enchanter killers to...tanks that ALMOST have a brain, pets will never replace tanks...but they should atleast do what their masters (and their masters' enchanters) want them to do!<P>I have over 150 days played as an enchanter, and have never voiced any concerns I have for the class, I have ALOT of fun playing an enchanter.  There are strengths and weaknesses of course, but I've learned to live with them...and I feel that the class is very effective in doing what it is supposed to do.  There are spells that don't work, and spells that don't work as well as I'd like...but overall I feel the class is effective, and our role is DEFINATELY in the group.  I think other classes could be more enchanter friendly, so to say...everyone should have the chance to try to keep me alive!  Just an old "pet-peeve" of mine, hope it gets some consideration...and I hope that it's possible.

</FONT><HR>Absor you are scaring the crap out of me!<P>"The Essential Enchanter: We should look into why an enchanter is considered ‘essential’ in a Kunark group, and perhaps change that. "<P>I have been following this thread, as well as the other classes, and I am convinced you want Enchanters to be nothing but buffers in Vellious. Fine, I already bought the CD, but I am not obligated to go play there. I can have fun controlling crowds in Kunark and still get to 60, which is a major goal of mine.<P>If you raise the MR of Kunark mobs, or set them as "unmezzable", I am going to completely FREAK OUT! You absolutely CAN NOT eradicate 90% of a class's effectiveness, which is what you do if you take away our crowd control. Let me try to explain to you why this is so alarming to me.<P>You designed this class to make groups more effective, giving us spells that make others play better. We can make melee characters attack faster, make casters recover mana faster, and most important, we can see to it that our group fights one monster at a time.  You gave us spells that are ONLY useful for this purpose!  When we are level 20 to 25 we go to Najena or Cazic Thule or Unrest and we learn tactics to do this very important job.<P>The price we pay for this knowledge is lots and lots of deaths. I have a level 27 Rogue who has died exactly four times. I know I am a better, more knowledgeable player now than when my Enchantress was that age, but even if i were to restart at level 1 with her, she would still die many many times just doing what is expected of her because of the nature of our contribution to a group.<P>As we go from 25ish to level 50, we grow in power. That power, however, STILL lies in the group. We get better buffs, and stronger mezzes to deal with the monsters who are getting exponentially harder, but we are not given the massive damage spells of the necro  or wizard or druid, we do not have pets anywhere near the strength of the mage pets. Nor do we want them. I absolutly love my role in a group! It is challenging, dangerous, and (therefore) FUN!<P>Now with Velious, you (Verant) have said to the Enchanter Class, " The way you have been playing your class for the last 35 levels is no longer an option. We have decided that you give groups an unfair advantage against monsters, therefore we are taking away the usefulness of those spells that, admittedly, we designed your class around"<P>Yes, other players will still want our buffs. How many enchanters do you think it takes to C2 and Haste 3 groups of warriors rogues and Clerics? How many people do you think want to play a class that does nothing but cast those spells and nothing else? And how do you think those players will react when our reason for existence is replaced with ability to change gender?<P>Do what you want in Velious, I have written it off as money badly spent, and I will not go back. You touch Kunark and I will completely lose my mind.<P>Qindara Psyrulean<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I had an idea on the issue of mez for higher level creatures.<P>It would require a new spell, which I know the team is not that excited about doing.  But it might be worth it.<P>Say at level 53 or so, give enchanters a new spell, which is possibly a bit weaker than their regular mez.  Make the recast time only about 2 seconds shorter than the duration (fixed duration).  Then make it stack with itself.<P>Here's the thing.  The spell, cast on a mob by one enchanter, would never mez the target.  HOWEVER, if multiple enchanters cast it, it would have a cumulative effect, and if "enough" of them hit the mob, it would eventually be mezzed.  How much is enough?  That depends on the creature.<P>Having the recast time nearly as long as the duration means that no single enchanter can stack the spell with itself.  It could not be put on an item, either; or possibly only on non-enchanter items, but I think there might be a squawk about that.<P>My enchanter's only level 4, so I might be way off base... but I hope others will see this and comment on its usefulness.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"Verant made chanter the Kings of Crowd Control"<P>This is the absolute truth.  Between the ability to charm/mez/stun/fear/etc, the majority of the enchanter's existence is spent doing crowd control.  They also perform the additional abilities of enhancing mana regen and buff/debuff.  Lastly, one of their main defining abilities as a class was the ability to illusion themselves to other forms.<P>The discussion concerning illusions concerns me because it appears that while Absor is very concerned about not giving enchanters wolf form with sow, he has no problems with necromancers being able to cast illusions or assume other forms.  Now you have shaman with bear form, etc.  You have items created that allow everyone and their brother to turn into dark elves and also iksar - and gave those abilities to classes that had no casting ability at all in many cases.  As it stands now, if as an enchanter I turn into a barbarian I get to use bash skill, if I am an iksar or troll I get regen - why is it so bad to give me sow in wolf form?  I think if you are looking to limit the abilities of the enchanter in this regard, then you should cut back on the mana regen and illusion abilities of other classes.  On the other hand, now that you have started down this road, it seems to make more sense to allow the enchanter to naturally pick up the abilities from the forms they assume.<P>As far as charm/mez/stun/fear/etc goes, when we look back to what the main purpose of being an enchanter is through their formative levels, why do you now make it impossible for them to perform this function at the higher levels?  What you have done is reduced the enchanter at high levels to assume their very much secondary role.  Even if you intended the enchanter to be more of a buff/debuff person than a charm/mez/stun/fear/etc person, that is not how the class is played for the most part - that seems to be more of the shaman's role in life.  If you are concerned about how their charm/mez/stun spells work at high levels, give them a charm/mez/stun etc that can work at high levels, but has a long recast time so as not to allow them to use it over and over - also make it less resistable.  At high levels it only takes one resist to kill you as an enchanter - you just can't absorb the kind of damage the creatures put out.<P>As an example, look at rogues... they can assassinate now up to level 53 mobs I think it is.  Even if they can't do that, it doesn't reduce their damage dealing ability in melee with a high level creature.  An enchanter really has little ability to deal with that creature in a group at high levels, they might get a tashan-type spell off, but other than that they end up doing more to buff the group than hurt the creature.  You seem to be asking enchanters at high level to totally change their playing style - yet other classes don't seem to have this issue.<P>One last note concerning uber mobs - look at how most of the killing is done.  A wave of tanks generally goes in first to beat the mob to down, then at a certain point nuking casters move in to hopefully take the creature down quickly.  You see more and more of these types of encounters at high levels, and there is not much for the enchanter to do except supply all the casters with clarity (except necros) and cast alacrity or shissar or something on the tanks, and then go from group to group and cast group magic resistance.  That's about it - they can try to toss some of their slow nukes with high resists at the mob, but otherwise they served most of their purpose before the fight ever started.  With the way Velious is designed you are going to see more and more of that, with all the dragon mobs.  So again, this is going to even more limit the enchanter's role in high level groups to mainly buff/debuff, and if a shaman is present, not much of that either.<P>Well, that is my 2 cents to this.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052705-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052705&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052705&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
