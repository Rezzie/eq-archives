</FONT><HR>when i started my enchanter i did not know much about EQ, or what an enchanter was. i started my character by putting all my extra points into str and agi, ill live with my mistake.  the problem i am facing now in the 50+ lvl's is the religion i unfortunatly chose. there are many places, that even with my illusions, and factions that i have worked hard to improve, plus my collaberating spells, i am still kos to sole'ly because of my religion. in real life people change their religion's all the time, in eq shouldnt there be some way to do the same? i would just ask that for those of us who did not know what we where doing at the start, would you please implement a quest inwhich the religion can be removed? or am i to be stuck with it for the rest of my gameing days, by the look of it, i dont know if i will even be capable of doing my epic quest because of those that look apon religion. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, just throwing my 2cp into the fray.<P>Here's the things I think need work. The reasons are well listed in this thread so I won't repeat them<P>1) Lull line<BR>2) WTYH line<BR>3) Religeon seen through illusions<BR>4) Lack of high level illusions (I think the illusion:gnome, troll etc ala "Boon of the garou" at 50+ is a great idea<BR>5) Refusal to consider enchanters a pet class<BR>6) MR of monsters/abuse of the "no mez" flag in velious.<BR>7) weaken/disempower line don't seem to do anything appreciable<BR>8) short durations on essential buffs keep us hopping up and down all the time.<P>That's about it. I really love the enchanter class and these issues probably seem trivial to most of the other classes but they asked  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Galadran<BR>8) </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I can't really walk around FV as an iksar...<P>Absor said:<BR>Educate me on this. Can't you just click the illusion off? <P>I say:<BR>With the Bard/Rogue illusion masks you get a 'You cannot remove this affect.' (yes, affect, it's a typo, and it's in the game) when you try to remove it. You SHOULD be able to drop item invoked illusions without having to zone.<BR>Enchanters can remove their own illusions though.<P>Ok it's an item bug issue, and not directly an enchanter issue, so I will end this post to ease the strain of too much text.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What the heck is wrong with enchanter mez/charm spells.  Boltrans is a lvl 53 charm spell with a lvl 53 cap on the lvl of the mobs that can be charmed.  The lvl 54 mez is also caped low so I'm a lvl 58 enchanter that goes into the hold and lots of golems can't be mezed or charmed.  Even if you want to put a cap on the mez/charm spell at least make that cap move as I go up in levels.  At level 58 I should be able to at least mez/charm up to lvl 54 mobs and probably higher.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>/agree Mezzmo<P>Especially about the worthlessness of memory blur spells in the higher levels (ie - memory flux with insane mana cost) and worthless lull spells.<P>I also want to add I feel that Rune 4 using a peridot is way too expensive given the usual short duration of it (ie - doesnt take many hits from a mob to get through it).  Please look into reducing the gem for Rune 4 (the same issue clerics are having with their symbol spells although ours are not nearly as long in duration).  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Make enchanters USEFUL again at 50+, the MR is rediculous. I have been turned into just a buffer. I cant hit the mobs because of the MR so basicly I just sit there and make sure the buffs dont wear off.<P>Please fix the single target stun. You totally GUTTED that line.<P>Reduce the agro on some of our spells. It is really pathetic that a warrior (who is taunting) is fighting a mob, I tash it (even when it is resisted) and boom, it is on me and no one can get it off until Im dead. Maybe that is your idea of how an enchanter is supposed to work, but Im TIRED of dying 30+ times a level.<P>As for illusions, I dont really care. They are just for fun. I dont use 90% of them because they are just for show and most make you totally KOS to everything. Only the ones that do actually enhance anything will I maybe use.<P>Overall enchanter are pretty good...at least up until lvl 50. After that, our usefullness is drasticly diminished.<P>Suggestions:<BR>-Our paper pets are useless ever since they were  nerfed a long time ago. After lvl 16 or so, no  one uses them anymore. Get rid of them and  replace with some kind of snare.<P>-Fix the single target stuns. They are useless.<P>-The Magic Resist PROBLEM. After lvl 50, the MR   makes us almost totally useless.<P>-Fix the AGRO on some of our spells. I would give  up all the illusions and 90% of the other spells  just to reduce the ago on some of our main   spells. Even if it was just to remove the agro on  the ones that are resisted would be enough.   Nothing like dying due to a resisted spell. It   makes you feel real useful.<P>-Maybe some better armor that has better AC so  that we can live through 6 or 7 hits.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Enchanters overall are balanced but there are places that definate improvements can be made:<P>- Weakness line of spells are virtually useless in PVE: make it so that they are as effective debuffs as strength buffs are on pcs<P>- Group illusions:  I know that you are worried about enchanters casting group dwarf illusion allowing players to shop somewhere so why not just give us group illusions that are for our non-race spells(earth elemental, spirit wolf, drybone, werewolf, etc.)<P>- Enchanted Weapons EASY solution - Make the regeant a weapon that is summoned by a mage.  IE. give me those swords of runes and I will give you two swords of chaotic feedback/tepid deeds/color shift for 1000 mana a sword.  The weps would poof before you enchanted them and they will poof after you log off so there should be no true unbalance issues.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Having played an enchanter to 57th level and enjoyed it very much, here are the main problems I have noticed with Enchanters.<P>1) Uber mobs that cant be mezzed, but DONT TELL you that they cant be mezzed until after you try. Then you have wasted the mana and have a 56+ level creature that wants to be your new best friend. - If a mob cant be mezzed by Dazzle or Glamor it realy should tell you this when you first start casting. This is the NUMBER ONE high level problem with enchanters as it causes you to get agroed and clobbered by mobs with no warning.<P>Plus in some zones there are way to many mobs that just simply cant be mezzed with Dazze or Glamor of Kinzan. Please tell me I didnt play all the way to 57+ to just sit around and buff the party for the last few levels did I?<P>2) What does the 55 Mem blur do except use up mana very quickly??? I havent seen any noticable effect even on light blue sub 50 mobs.<P>3) Change the name of the 56th level spell augment, everyone gets if confused with Augmentation, If I have to explain the difference once more I think Ill puke.<P>4) Please consider changing the look of the Planes robe to something unique.

</FONT><HR>Now, before I get started on this, I have only been an enc. for a little bit, only 12th lvl butI do have some concerns. I won't mention anything higher than my lvl because I really have no knowledge of them. But the two things I would like to see some additions are the following:<P>ILLUSIONS:<BR>I would love to see some additonal illusions because as many people forget, EQ is a game<BR>and should be fun and there is nothing more fun than changing into some illusion and<BR>wrecking havoc ex. I can't wait to be able to change into a werewolf and run around<BR>Qeynos Hills or Toxxulia Forest scaring newbies or dropping that coin, casting Minor Illusion and watching the fun begin. One thing I would like to see, that I think is doable considering Minor Illusion. I would like an illusion that changes you into a nearby Mob, similar to what Minor Illusion does with a random object. Ex. walking around the Desert of Ro and getting morphed into a madman. Oh well, just my thought.<P>PETS:<P>I've noticed that at low lvls, Enc. pets are relatively weak and die easily forcing us to<BR>melee which we are pretty lousy at which almost forces us to have to group. Please, please make our pets a smidge stronger.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Boon of the Clear mind (Lvl 52); dont get me wrong this is a great spell.. but due to it's placement in realation to C2(lvl 54)it has had its life span greatly redused... who wants group clarity when they can get C2?  If you follow the trend Breeze lvl 16... and 3 spell circles later at 29 clarity that would Place Boon at Lvl 44 this would give it a fantastic life span.  Even Lvl 49 would be a much more useful.<P>and a wierd random fun thought to make the Bind Sight series useful:  Make it to where we can cast around corners thru the eyes of the tank but ONLY if the target is still within normal casting range of the caster<P>Sentinel:  heh ok thoughts on this spell tho fun to cast at wedding while every one is drunk.. this one has trouble, Give it a less particle intense graphic I am sick of getting petitoned for using my spell to watch my parties back in duengons. and make it to where it can be shut off.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, this will never be read since it's at the but-end of the thread...heh...but here goes.<P>I know it's been said, MANY times, and I believe it just shows how much it's wanted and needed by the enchanter community: Illusions.<P>First, they are not a power or balance issue, and that's great.  That means implementing them will not throw the game out of wack, and they won't make us 'Gods' any more then we are perceived to be.  I for one am the type of enchanter who is ALWAYS in illusion, I save my eighth slot for just my illusion and roleplay to the extreme. (Oh, and yes, PLEASE stop illusions from dropping when zoning, and uh...fix the 'shrink bug', please?)  I find it disturbing that all of these discussion focus on only powergameing mechanics, it feels like.  Now I'm not trying to get anyone upset, and I guess the fight for Roleplaying in EQ died long ago, but at least in the past Verant gave a good effort to at least make it look like they supported it!  Enchanters are the role players class, I mean come on, we can be whatever we want, and act out the role.  All I see discussed is mechanics...this casts to slow, this fizzles to much...in a real world would a enchanter complain to his master and Gods that his spells we no good?  My point being, I feel that adding illusions would benefit the class greatly, and that they add fun to the game.<P>-Fix illusion so that they do not drop at zones and so casters real size does not show when others view them after a zone.<P>-Add MORE illusions!!!  Don't have to 'waste' valuable global file space, give us some new ones.  There are TONS of great ideas here already!<P>-This is not class related, Verant, could you please make a stand on roleplaying?  In the past we, the ever-shrinking RP community, were teased with 'discussions' on a Roleplaying server, and there is a roleplay flag in game that is NEVER used for that...and now nothing is ever said.  There is a thread in the wish list that is rotting with over 300 replies and not one blue name, why?  We all feel because it focuses on a aspect of the game that is roleplay-oriented.  I've gone off on a big tangent, and yeah it's off topic I suppose, but I don't post much so I thought I'd squeeze it all in one shot.  Just let us know where you stand as a company.<P>In recap:<P>-Fix or let us know why you cannot illusions.<P>-Add more variety and or new illusions<P>-Roleplaying Verant?  Is this medieval Quake or are you willing to even TRY to listen to our needs?<P>Thanks for your time.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Some areas in Velius are very boring for enchanters, but we feel compelled to go because our friends need our buffs. A couple of suggestions to make these areas more fun.<P>1. A non Magic Resistant based DD spell, so we can burn mana when we have nothing else to do with it.<P>2. An ability like Lay on Hands, say Lay on Stun, a single target low resistant, once a day 30 second stun. This would add a lot of excitement to playing an enchanter while not being unbalancing.<P>I agree with others, that more ac is necessary.<P>For PvP enchanters used to be the best, now are the worst.

</FONT><HR>O'tay, I'm not an enchanter, but have travelled with the same enchanter for 30 levels now.  I have two concerns, and they have been stated many times already, but I even notice these since every night, I travel with the same group.  I am a level 37 druid, and I thought I aggro'd heavy if I didn't watch my casting. I am forever rooting the monster to keep it off the enchanter, cleric stunning it, warrior(s) taunting and hacking.  All that after one or two spells from the enchanter.<BR>     <BR>Someone earlier said that warriors are the crowd control in Velious, so true at times.  Either that, or I rooting it.  And this is at around mid to high 30's!  Not to mention the debuffs do not seem to affect the mobs melee capabilities.  She really really tries to be an efficient crowd control person, but the taunt factor mixed in with MR, mixed in with seemingly useless debuffs, makes her more efficient as a buffing enchanter.<P>I have better pre-control crowd control with Harmony.  Granted, not in dungeons...so guess what?  We stay outside unless we find a decent dungeon with bearable MR mobs.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

We get beat up so much in combat that it'd be a nice alternative.<BR>Similarly, I want a 1HB staff that looks like a sword, but that might just be me.<P>QUESTS:<BR>Quest-based items should, in my opinion, be better stuff you buy.  Tashania, for example, is only slightly better than Tashani with a massive taunt, so either the effect should go up or the taunt down.  I'd like to see more quests for us; after all, we ARE the most capable of doing most quests.<P>OLD SPELLS:<BR>In a perfect world, no spell should suck.<BR>Whirl, for example, could have its effect simply be replaced with the Cleric stun spells.  Not very exciting, of course, but at least we'd use it sometimes.<P>NEW SPELLS:<BR>More faction spells.  For example, one person long ago suggested a line of five or six spells (he referred to them as the Mantle line) that reset your deity choice to a given god.  So, add Mantle: Innoruk, M: Quellious, M: Tunare, M: Rallos Zek, M: Karana, and M: Agnostic (the lowest-level one).  This one's just to get over the headache of being punished for actually picking a god early on, and people actually have to remember which god goes with which city.<BR>More Group spells.  They're just headache-reducers.  I'm not talking about illusions, necessarily, but things like Group versions of Augmentation, Invisibility, Levitate, and so on.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>How about allowing the same type of mez overwrite each other?<P>Example, Level 60 and Level 58 enchanters on a raid headed to Trak, when we get to juggers we have to switch to Glamour, a costly spell. If the level 60 hits it first, my spell 'Does not hold' but still aggro's (that part is just plain dumb).<P>Also I can't assist the level 60 by taking one of her targets till it break.. cause the spell 'Does not hold' (but still aggros thanks).<P>This goes for any mez spell really, lets allow dazzle to overwrite dazzle.. etc.. I don't see a problem with this, but if you can't allow it for some reason.. please take out the aggro of spells that 'don't hold'.<P>And about the level thing.. its really frustrating about the same spell not overwriting just based on level (goes for rune and others), it basically means your stating 'Unless your the same level as every other enchanter on the raid, don't bother going'. <P>Hope I made myself clear enough.<P>Sis</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ok, I haven't had a chance to go through everyone else's posts, so if this has been posted already, too bad.  I know our pets don't accept commands, but I would just like &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; command:  /pet holdstillforonefriggensecond!    You might want to change the command name a little bit before implementing this one, but when I'm sitting there medding, well, it's bad enough that I have to stare at this very boring, very dull book.  This is compounded by the fact that I have to listen to footsteps the entire time!  Sometimes he holds still, but most times he does not.  I know it's probably a geometry thing, but I just can't take the footsteps any longer!

</FONT><HR>Enchanter Pet Idea:<P>Ok, I know we will never be able to command our pets and in all cases but for my following suggestion I have no problem with that. The problem with pets is that it makes crowd control much less effective or even disastrous. I was wondering if you could do something as simple as:<P>1) Giving us ONE and ONE only pet command..<BR>/pet back off<P>or much more creative, but would accomplish the same thing..<P>2) "Impose Will" ( or somesuch thing ) Lev 19ish?<BR>which would enable us to expend mana, so we pay for the convienience of being able to cast a very short term (20 secs or so ) Mez on our pet, having extremely short cast time, that would also wipe it's hate list. So.. if my Brainless Anim went after something that attacked me, I could Target pet, Impose Will, Stun Mob, Mez Mob, Pet breaks Impose Will, and then calmly resumes his bodyguarding, but doesn't aggro again on the mob.<P>This would enable Enchanters to still use pets as a damage shield, without reducing their ability to maintain crowd control. <P>Maybe at higher level you could even give us one more upgrade to the line like "Enforce Will" ( lev 49? ish )that would give us 2 commands, /pet back off and /pet attack, that way in Uber- Mob situations we could at least sic our pets on the bad guy without having to get aggro'ed on in the process.<P>Thanks for listening  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>So many comments on enchanters.  Here's a short 2 cents:<P>(I'm only level 30 so my perspective is from that)<P>Dyn's Dizzying Draught:  Have you seen the recycle time on this spell??  Sheesh!  It takes like 30 full seconds to reset and lasts maybe...MAYBE 5 seconds until a tank bashes a mob.  It's not reasonable to ask that tanks don't bash, and I think the bash thing is wrong anyway -- it just plain doesn't last like I'm sure it was intended to.  Total dissapointment in this spell, I use whirl till you hurl over and over and over and over.  Removing the "thing" that breaks it would help in our crowd control abilities and lessen the need for strong in-battle healers (aka clerics) if one can't be found.<P>Lull - The first 5 times I used this were miserable failures.  Highly resistant to the point of uselessness.  I'm okay with not using it, but if it's going to be useless get rid of the line altogether.  We enchanters benefit groups in many other ways so I say just nix lull.  Replace it with a summon food/water line! :P<P>Other than that, I really REALLY love my class.  I've played many other classes to high levels too, and this is hands down the funnest grouping class to play.  I say grouping class because soloing is just plain a hassle with this class.  I'm okay with that, there's no balance issue there.  We were created to be group dependent, and groups are dependent on us.  It's a great synergy and I love it....except when I can't find a group.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I think we're balanced, just fix the broken stuff.<P>Thanks!<BR>-Yappie-</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would like to see the magic resistance of some velious mobs lowered, and maybe another mez spell that can work on giant flagged monsters.  In PoG I get bored because all anyone needs me for is my buffs.  Most things i can mez and I end up going afk or sitting at comp.  reading a book until buffs wear off.<BR>I saw another class ask about their effect on the PoG robe, so I guess I could bring it up.  Rune IV that takes a long cast time and still requires a component is insane.  If we just med during the time it takes to cast it we'll have the mana to cast rune V.  Maybe make it 15 sec cast time that doesn't require a component or make it our lvl 60 mana buff.<BR>More illusions would be nice but they are just for fun.<BR>I would also like to see single target mezes overwrite ae mezes.  I think but not completly sure that at one time they could.<BR>Maybe a single target tash that would debuff a major about of magic resis.<BR>This isn't very important but it always bugged me about how we can't control our pets.  If were not a pet class even though we get at lvl 1, but shamans don't get pet that early but they are.  Then druids (i think but not sure) can control their pets.  Just seems kinda weird there.  I guess I just want you to admit we are a pet class  but giving commands would be overpowering.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Enchanter resists are a major issue, not even going to go into PvP resists <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">.  How about making enchanter Dots lower a certain amount of Magic resist on a mob.  It wouldn't unbalance the game because the mob would have to have low enough MR for you to even get the dot on him (around 120 sv vs magic and they're practically imune even after tash)<P>and in PvP cure poison cancels the tashania-line, very annoying...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hey,<P>Whoever suggested earlier to increase Boon of Grau to like 30 min with 15 min recast is insane.. this basically means that when I mem the spell it takes 15 mins BEFORE I can use it for the first time. So it will forever use one of my already precious 8 spell slots. I have no trouble juggling spells all day but with 15 min recast you cant take it out. Im lev 53 and we have no problem creaming stuff in The Hole, Sebilis, Karnor, Howling Stones etc WITHOUT using Grau.. now if it was 15 mins recast I would simply never ever use it... period...<P>Suggestion : leave it as is.. who cares. I got plenty to do in the hard zones like mez things and slow etc to worry about rebuffing 1 tank to have a cool werewolf form regardless of recast time.. Ill use AQuickening and leave it at that. I mean ya it makes him alot better but for the cost of the spell its not worth it in the end to waste my time over the time to the entire group. Furthermore any upgrade in the usefulness of just casting the spell would probably unbalance it anyway making it far too powerful. Esp for lev 39.. maybe make it lev 52 or 56 or something.<P>Zambartas Xryl<BR>53 Chantimator<BR>Lanys</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 16 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-11.html">11</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-12.html">12</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-13.html">13</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-14.html">14</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-15.html">15</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-16.html">16</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052139&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052139&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
