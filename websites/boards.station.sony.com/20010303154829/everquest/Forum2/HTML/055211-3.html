I want the damage formula be the same as other weapons. Granted, double attack might not be appropriate, but I want to do the same damage with a 20 dmg bow as with a 20 dmg sword.<P>Of the changes proposed on test, I like the endure/resist cold spells.

</FONT><HR>Seeing as these discussions are about balance, I always did have a couple of questions about the balance of the Ranger class in relation to the other Hybrids.  I don't think anyone would argue that the intention is for Shadowknight and Paladin defense to balance Ranger offense, and I think that this goal has, for the most part been accomplished.  Where my concern lies is with special skills and hitpoints.  SKs and Pallies both get their own unique (and significant) skill which is usable in combat.  This is, i assume, supposed to be balanced by tracking, which has to be shared with Druids and Bards and while very useful, leaves rangers with no unique hybrid skill.  Then there is the hitpoints.  Rangers have absolutely nothing to balance the hitpoint bonus the other hybrids get.  This is something I never understood, and I think before any other Ranger balance issue is undertaken, this should be addressed.  I have a lot of difficulty understanding why Rangers don't have the same hitpoints (through all the levels) as the other hybrids, especially since Rangers have no bonuses to make up for this.<P>Just my 2 cents worth. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I forgot to add one very important thing to this discussion.<P>When I am grouped the Ranger is typically the last to die and I'll tell you why.  Because I (Shadow Knight) can out taunt him and keep the mob on me almost the entire fight.  If the cleric runs out of mana unless my FD succeeds which many times it does not... I will be first to die every time.  In fact one of the best tag teams in Melee classes are Shadow Knight(Taunter) with Rogue back stabber.<P>The point is that even with the defensive weakness that Rangers must carry it can be mitigated by having another member of your party act as Tank.  Typical groups I have been in there are normally 3 caster slots and 3 melee slots. I usually find myself with Rangers in my groups due to the High number on my server.  Believe me if a Warrior or Shadow Knight is in your group and your taking the majority of the hits he need a f'n kick in his lazy non-taunting arse... hehe<P>This is a group game and if your group doesnt understand its aggro role.. that is Warrior or Shadow Knight does the majority of the taunting... well then as most bad groups go people will die.<P>I just think that the value of taunt never seems to come up and that the sum of the power of an entire group is more than the sum of its parts.  Therein lies the true answer I believe to the Rangers main weakness.<P>Truely I have in the past regretted the Shadow Knights ability to taunt... Used by an effective Shadow Knight is UNREAL.<P>Kaitan (Nightmare Clan)<BR>55 Shadow Knight<BR>Ayonae Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alan, lets summarize, I’ll just go through and list the issues for you. I think is fair to say that every issue has been covered pretty extensively.<P>-Offense     (Already on test, /cheer)<BR>-Archery     (Line of Sight, Min Damage)<BR>-Trueshot    (Damage!)<BR>-Jolt        (Resist, lvl acquired, mana use)<BR>-Tracking    (Waiting patiently)<BR>-See Invis   (Need it)<BR>-Disarm      (Don’t need it)<P><BR>The new spells on test are great! We all really do appreciate that.<P>Here’s the other main issue that plagues the ranger class. What do we offer to that perfect group? The answer HAS to be “total sustained damage and utility.” However, the thing that people see is the huge lack of survivability that goes along with rangers. I feel that for us to truly be a part of that perfect group (or at least interchangeable into that group) that our total sustained damage and utility has to compensate for our lack of defense. And obviously at this point, that’s not the case (again kudos on the new test changes). Groups need to say “Well the ranger got beat up pretty good, but he did an awesome amount of damage, and saved us all with his/her utility” Something to that effect  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>And last I would like to commend my fellow rangers for the way this thread has gone. While not all of our opinions are the same, you all have handled this is in a very professional and appropriate manner. We may have had quite some time to prepare but, I think its fair to say that this is one of the best thought out and flame-free class balance threads so far. I think that speaks volumes for the ranger community.

</FONT><HR>Darkadept... please tell me you play on the Rathe.  If so tell me in game and we can group.  I guarantee the only mobs who's attention you'll get over me are the ones that are hanging around when I'm dead (which won't take long).  You as well as most people who argue Rangers don't need better defense forget that snare is one of the hands down best taunts in the game.  I have taunted mobs off wizards that triple-nuked just with snaring.  This is one of the few things we bring to a group assuming they don't have a druid, so it's not exactly feasable to say "don't snare if you don't want agro".  That's what we are there for in most situations.  Combine that with the fact that Rangers high damage output is largly attributed to the ability to dual wield.  You'll get moved up the agro list WAY faster with four 35 point hits than one 140 point hit.  If i don't have a warrior in my group, the 1 handers go in the bags and out comes the big slow 2 hander because I know while doing less damage, I'm going to get less agro.  Even then though, after the needed snare to keep my group from having to deal with 12 of our enemies friends, I usually have a_nasty_mob_00 making me feel like I never should have touched him as I watch my health bubbles disappear like casters in a bad pull.  Just kiddin casters.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hehe, DarkAdept.<P>You can't *outtaunt* a ranger, but you sure can keep a mob from hitting a "Walks on Eggshells, cuz jolt don't work for squat, ANTI aggro ranger"<P>I've gotten in taunt battles with SK's in full taunt mode for fun, sure, the mob ping pongs from SK to Ranger and back and forth.  So, what you really mean is, you can keep agro if the ranger lets you, e.g. doesn't cast any high taunt spells, heaven forbid Earthcaller procs and Call of Fire double procs.<P>Not saying that you are wrong in doing so, personally, I love not getting hit.  I stand behind mobs with my 14/24 and 13/21 and go to town on the backs of mobs, wishing I could do even half the dmg of a equal lvl rogue and get away with it scott free.  I love letting others that are more suited for it get hit.  Just like if you wanted a damage dealer in your group and you had to choose between SK or Ranger or Warrior who would you pick?<P>D'OH!  Guess the ranger goes off and root/dots some low blues while auctioning for a group.  Either that or logs and plays his warrior/rogue.  And the SK goes off and does particularly evil stuff to small woodland creatures and various other innocents.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Kaitan, its very easy to manage aggro in sebilis or charasis or basically anywhere where you're in a one group environment. The big problems come in on uber mobs where all it takes is one resisted epic proc (and sometimes not even that) to make it turn on a ranger. When that happens, its only a matter of time before the caster, oops, I mean ranger is dead (either when the cleric is oom or decides he doesn't want to go oom trying to save the ranger). This is far from balanced for a class that could tank almost as good as a warrior before Kunark. And as for giving us a defense boost making there no reason to play a warrior, explain how that is any different than having sk's and paladins have 252 defense and 230 offense in addition to their spells? Its not. Rogues and Monks have 252 defense and 252 offense yet tons of people still play warriors. Why? Better armor, more hp, better damage tables, awesome disciplines, especially defensive which is necessary for the majority of velious encounters. So before you start deriding rangers for asking for a defense increase that would reduce the frenzy effect caused by us being perceived (rightfully so) as doing a lot of damage and easy to kill, look at what your class is getting on test and see if you think Sk's deserve an increase to 230 offense skill. And while you're doing that, keep in mind that Sk's and pallies have weapons that compensate for their lower caps (which, btw were still raised when rok came out, NO rangers defensive skills including d/p/r were) while rangers have to make do with 200 defense and shaman armor class armor that doesn't even have SoV upgrades. Consider that, and tell me if additional defense to allow rangers to replace warriors.<P>Faelagund Silvanfather<BR>Guildmaster, Silvan Rangers<BR>59th Outrider of Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>DarkAdept,<P>&gt;&gt;The point is that even with the defensive weakness that Rangers must carry it can be mitigated by having another member of your party act as Tank.&lt;&lt;<P>Oh, so everything is ok with the ranger class as long as we carry around a member of another class with us at all times. Or do we have to belong to a long standing perfect group?  <P>This doesn't fly DarkAdept and you know it.  That's like me saying: Sure, SK's are just fine as long as you have another person like Warrior, Rogue or Monk to do the dmg in the group.<P>I understand that I am not supposed to tank as a Warder.  I understand that I'm supposed to let mobs hit the beefy guys in plate instead of me.  But what happens on a multi mob pull with no bard or chanter, and your tank(whether it be SK/Pal/War) is getting the beat down?  Cleric heals the tank, extras attack cleric, ranger sees this, flamelicks/snares/taunts/hits extra mobs until they leave cleric alone and then parks them away from the group and does his rangerly duties.  At what cost though?  Rangerboy only has 2500hp self buffed(2526 in my case, will be more with cleric buffs obviously).  Rangerboy gets the extra mobs parked with little dmg done to the cleric, this is a good thing.  But now the cleric has to heal Rangerboy.  What should the cleric use to heal the badly battered Rangerboy?  400mana CH? 350mana Celestial Elixir? 2 Divine Lights(which fizzle like a mofo)? Or a few 175mana Remedies?  Realize this, if the ranger had the same HP as a paladin or sk(not equal defense or AC) the choice would be simplified, a much more efficient heal could be cast on Rangerboy without a second thought, and all would be well in the group.<P>As is however, the rate at which rangers generate agro, take dmg, and approach death is NOT balanced.  The efficiency with which a cleric heals a ranger is NOT balanced in regards to members of other classes.  The dmg done by Rangers does NOT warrant this disparity.  Rogues and Monks have well tested and proven ways to mitigate agro AND they do astronomical dmg/min, whereas Rangers have a spell that comes too late, costs too much mana, fizzles, and is resisted too much.<P><BR>Don't get me wrong, I don't think SKs are fine and dandy either.  Paladins are in a worse boat than both Rangers and SKs imo.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I need to preface this by saying I have never played a ranger.  However, I have grouped with them frequently as a warrior, and I feel their pain.<P>Rangers are one of the most versatile classes in the game, they can do almost everything, and do it well.  They pay for this in low AC, HP, and defense skills.  Fair enough.<P>However, these penalties, in many cases, make it impossible for a ranger to use all their wonderful abilities effectively without getting themselves killed.<P>For instance, a ranger is a wonderful puller, between tracking, harmony, snare, and archery.  However, no sane group would ever let a ranger pull, because  once the mob gets on the ranger, it's never coming off.<P>Another thing that makes rangers a valuable asset is their ability to snare.  However, snare is one of the biggest taunt spells in the game, and using it will get the ranger killed.<P>Rangers are also fantastic damage dealers, with their ability to dual wield fast, hard-hitting weapons.  However, dual wielding fast, hard-hitting weapons is another very large taunt which will, again, get the ranger killed.<P>Basically, making the most of their abilities (or in some cases using them at all) will get a ranger killed.  No hybrid or melee, doing everything they can to taunt, can taunt better than a ranger who doesn't even try to.  Furthermore, no hybrid or melee class is less able to deal with the degree of taunt that a ranger generates.  Warriors, SK's and Pallies have AC, HP and skills, rogues have evade, monks have FD.<P>To be an effective and enjoyable class, rangers need a way to deal with the amount of taunt they generate, either through increased defenses (AC, HP, defense skills) or some way to shed aggro, something similar to evade for rogues.  To me a method of decreasing aggro is more balanced and more in keeping with the class.  I realize that jolt performs this task, but not until lvl 55, and this is a problem that plagues rangers from their 20's on.<P>Given the idea that rangers are more of a dexterity/agility based fighter than a brute strength warrior (this seems to be the way rangers were intended, am I right?) it would seem very reasonable and in keeping with the class to give them an evade skill.  This would solve a very key problem with the class, one much more fundamental than trueshot disc's or exp penalties or any of the other improvements that have been made recently.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I think Rangers could use a few changes... <P>First, we need our hit points increased a bit. I'm one of the best equiped Rangers in the game and at 60 I have about 2.1k hit points unbuffed (2149 to be exact). Our level 60 Paladin who is also well equiped has about 2800 unbuffed (2779 to be exact, again). Isn't that a bit too much of a difference? I think you need to gradually increase Ranger's hp starting at some level to equal about 300 more hit points at 60. 2.1k (and this is with uber gear) is just a bit low, hell our caster classes can get that many hit points unbuffed if they try. I know Rangers aren't tanks, but we should have a substantial ammount more then a pure caster class. <P><BR>Now about skill caps...I've heard what they are on test, and frankly they don't make sense. From the info I've gathered so far these are the caps, could you perhaps verify them for us (I've got some conflicting info fom various players)? <P>Ranger Current - 240 Offense, 240 Weapons, 200 Defense, 235 Double Attack, 170 Dodge, 150 Riposte, 220 Parry : 1455 points. <BR>Paladin/SK Current - 230 Offense, 225 Weapons, 230 Defense, 235 Double Attack, 155 Dodge, 200 Riposte, 205 Parry : 1480 points. <P>Ranger Proposed - 252 Offense, 250 Weapons, 200 Defense, 235 Double Attack, 170 Dodge, 150 Riposte, 220 Parry : 1477 points. <BR>Paladin/SK Proposed - 230 Offense, 225 Weapons, 252 Defense, 235 Double Attack, 155 Dodge, 200 Riposte, 205 Parry: 1502 points. <P>This is a bit out of wack imo. Paladins/SKS getting very high defense while retaining still pretty good offense. While Rangers get high offense, we have horrible defense. My proposal of where to put the "missing" points? Put 20 into defense so that Ranger's aren't so low in that area compared to Paladin and SKs Defense to Offense ratio. The other 5 points, put those into double attack or Dual weild (which I believe caps at 240 currently). I didn't include Dual Weild in this list of caps because Dual Weild is what we get in exchange for having much lower AC armor. I think this is a perfectly logical and great solution. <P>Actually there is even more of a difference then I listed in the skills. Taunt for Rangers: 150, Taunt for SKs/Paladins: 180. Disarm for Rangers: 56, Disarm for SKs/Paladins, 70. I just thought these skills a bit unimportant to list at first, but still I should so them to show how much farther ahead they are.<P><BR>Finally, there are some spell stacking issues. Our spells we have gotten recently are nice, but they have some problems. Call of Earth doesn't stack with the most commonly used haste line - Shissar/Aug series. And Strength of Nature doesn't stack with the Paladin Divine Strength Spell (well, you can make them stack with a bug). This makes both of these spells sort of useless when on a raid/in certain groups. Maybe you guys could look into that. Oh and, while all these spells you are giving us are nice...we're running out of buff slots to put them in, literally. <P><BR>I'd mention tracking like everyone else is going to, but Rowyl already said the changes are going in and there is no real need to discuss the issue. <P>Thanks, <P>Sean the Scaled Claw <BR>Level 60 Warder <BR>Fires of Heaven<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well most of our concerns have been displayed by many others.  I think the best way to solve any balance issue is by a few methods.  It's really simple and I am sure many players would enjoy and welcome the joy of helping their class.<P>Each day have 1 of every level above 50.  Equip them in the finest equipment and some of the "general" equipment due to many not having the general luxury of earning the high end items.  Test them that way.  That is is in the most part the MOST effective way.<P>As being one of the more fortunate rangers out there, I can easily mention that even with higher AC it is really tough to not get aggroed on and die.<P>I currently have over 1060 ac buffed and it is still very tough.  This is due to our poor defense which is equivalent to Clerics, Shamans, etc.<P>Let me first explain how we are penalized.<P>1.  Rumor is AC soft cap is 1100.  This is where the "curve" bonus becomse minimal.<P>2.  Warriors/Pally/SKs generally have NO problem achieving that cap.<P>3.  What this enables these 3 classes to do is PUMP in the hit point related items.  Rangers have NO options of doing that.  Any ranger who drops 10 to 15 ac for 50 hp would be out of their mind.  Unfortunately we do NOT have that luxury of that.<P>4.  Our goal is to raise our ac up and up and up thus removing other beneficial items just to survice.<P>With an ac of 1060+ and an attack of over 1350 on raids,  I can EASILY tell you how fast we get plastered.  To reduce the aggro,  I generally use a 2h (Woodsman staff) and I have to turn off attack every 10 seconds for 2 seconds to actually live.  In that essense, I am losing approx 1/6 of my total damage output because we have no successful evade skill or defense mechanism to prevent us from getting destroyed.<P>What I am NOT asking for is comparable defense to a warrior.  I agree that we should not be able to tank like them.<P>What I think we deserve is what others posted.<P>1. HP comparable to our other hyrbid classes<BR>2. Jolt unresistable (raising manacost would be a fair exchange)<BR>3. Give us an evade skill in place of Jolt<BR>4. Give us the same defense Paladins get in Offense skill.  Its just natural that our offense is equal to their Defense and vice versa.<BR>5. Make the bow have a set minimum damage and make arrows effect more so on damage output (not necessarily making archery a viable form of combat)<P>While these ideas have been justified over and over again,  I dont think anyone has even noticed how much of an advantage swapping AC gear for HP gear means once you reach that soft cap. (whether Verant wants to admit that cap or not is not the point)<P>As a formal beta tester, I would gladly spend hours of my time to "test" and "improve" our class and fine tune it as I am sure MANY others would.<P>Xantha Xziere<BR>60th Warder<BR>Xegony<BR>Inner Circle</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Woot back to my original char!!!  Rangers.  I am still in love with this class.<P>Relatively new thoughts on Rangers. <P>I really liked what I was seeing from Trueshot prior to it being 'fixed'.  Yes, maybe it was overpowering but I'd like to see it be able to outdamage straight melee and give rangers an alternative to this type of battle.<P>I really can see the ranger class going two ways.<P>1) Pretty much the generic EQ game that has been going on..this would entail such things as...<P>a) Slightly higher defense caps.  (220 is not unreasonable, especially if SKs and Palis go to 250 defense with wars.)<P>Sidethought on our defense: You are giving Bards 250 defense (Yes, on test, it's not set in stone.  I just don't understand the reasoning behind this upgrade and still keeping Rangers capped at lev 39 caps (same as shaman and druid defense caps))  So not only can they wear plate but they are just naturally more defensive than the hearty outdoorsman?  The singer and entertainer can take bunches better than the woodsman roughing it in the wild for his lifestyle?  <P>b) Jolt is actually fairly decent now that the resists have been modified as well as a 2 sec decrease in casting time.  My only small problem is that it is mana dependant and does not alleviate that much damage a Ranger has put into a mob.  As well as it takes up a spell slot.  Again, when Rangers were asking for help in this area we had more of an 'evade' type skill in mind.<P>OR Rangers could be something totally new...<P>2) The archer.  Broken Trueshot showed how great Rangers could be and how limited the power of range attack could be if controlled properly.  <P>I for one would like to see the Ranger class move in this direction.  Keep the defense caps as they are and give Rangers a viable archery skill that can be used as an alternative to toe to toe combat.  <P>END NOTE:  Damage mitigation really needs to be looked into.  My Rogue absorbs damage extremely well.  Some hits are for full and a good portion are for a minimal amount.  My Ranger ALWAYS gets smacked for at least 60%+ of the damage per hit.  I just bring these two up cause they have the most similar AC.  In fact it is identical prior to 51 (although the Rogue mitigates more damage noticably prior to 51 as well).  <P>For the Ranger it is really fine tuning.  <P>I was always one that thought ALL teh hybrids needed to be able to fill at least 1 portion of what a warrior can bring to a group.  It's nice to see that these things are finally happening.<P>Semi related issue.<BR>SOFTCAPS: This probably concerns SKs and Palis more.  But the softcaps being at 1100 ac/attk are a little low.  The reasoning behind my thoughts?<P>By the time a Ranger hits 60 he is struggling to get into the 1050-1100 AC range but is easily outdamaging Palis and Sks who can easily have more AC than this.  Also Wars and monks hit this soft cap a few levels after 50 as it really is not a challenge for them to hit the softcap.<P>Maybe rework how AC works and damage is mitigated for Rangers and push the softcap back to 1200 or even 1300 so wars are getting the full effect from their armor while Rangers fall short of it but can actually absorb some hits.  This way Rangers arn't approaching the softcap (which in the BEST gear they can hit it).  But then again Rangers are getting pounded as there really is very little difference between 950AC and 1050+ for a Ranger. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Its probably too late to fix/change this... but most ranger equipment is far to heavy. Rangers are 'of nature' and many choose to live in tune with their environment. Travelling light, foraging their food, and rarely needing to return to towns for supplys.<P>They wear lightweight Chain armors (Thorny, and Tolans have 'chainlike' AC, but both sets are too heavy. Especially for the 'Small' race rangers.<P>Rangers should have a weight limit... a bit like monks. As rangers are a chain based class, and monks leather, Ranger should obviously be able to carry a higher weight... But ive seen rangers who carry 200+ weight. So much for light/agile rangers hehe.<P>In full Thorny Vine, and decent weapons ETC, I used to be able to get my weight down to 55, including weapons. In full tolans the best I can manage is around 100.<P>After the reduction of weight on the high level Ranger equipment, a weight limit should be emposed onto the ranger class. My initial though was around 55 weight based on the full thorny set, but perhaps thats a little low. Assuming the Ranger armors were adjusted a weight of 75 - 100(perhaps a variable scale from 50 at level 1 to 100 at level 60??).<P>Anyway... back to the point. Rangers should be light and agile, so perhaps like monks, a Ranger who obeys the weight restriction would get bonuses. A small bonus to Defence (half, or even quarter of the monk bonuses), and a small bonus to offence... How about any ranger under the weight limit gets tripple attack, or an offhand bonus.<P>Well, Im sure its totally too late for Everquest, but perhaps in any subsequent games from Verant, something like this should be considered  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Back on track....<BR>An increase to warrior offence, combined with zero increase to HP's and defence skills, really wont be that great for Rangers.<P>Either rangers should be considered an offensive class, and moved up in damage to surpass warriors, and end up between warriors, and the current level of monk offence. Even with no change to defence this would probably be ok...<P>OR, a balanced upgrade, to both offence, and defence. If we only have warrior like offence (without tripple attack we'll never be warrior offence at 60th) then we must have an improved Defence and HP's.<P>High level Ranger equipment, is so bad in the HP/STA areas that many 60th rangers have 400 - 500 less hp's than Monks (who start out with 100 hps lower when naked)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>More realistic HP and defence that take into account mobs fought at level 60. Melee's should not have the same defence as a caster.

</FONT><HR>I've read most of the posts above (although I skipped a few I admit) ...archery seems to be a recurring theme that everyone wants to see 'fixed' - Line of Sight, lost arrows (for no obvious reason) and Z-Axis issues are the major concerns, but damage is also a contentious issue.  Its almost as frustrating to see a damage 8 arrow, fired from a damage 40 bow hit for 1 point of damage as it is to see it miss completely.<P>Here's an idea to enhance archery damage a little under 'normal' (i.e. non-discipline) conditions. First a little discussion of how things stand currently: <P>The basic bow damage formula, excluding any adjustments for skill level and dexterity is something like: <P>max damage = bow damage + arrow damage <P>e.g. Trueshot / RainCaller & 3 damage arrows = 20 + 3 <P>There is no level-adjusted minimum damage, so even with 220 skill, 255 dex and the heaviest damaging bows in the game it is still possible to hit for 1 point of damage... and we often do. Also the contribution of the arrow damage to the formula is relatively small, especially with high damage bows (and arrows) <P>Instead of the simple a+b formula I propose a slightly more complicated (but not too difficult to understand) formula that enhances the damage slightly through increasing the proportion of the damage contributed by the arrow. <P>I propose a formula where: <P>max damage = bow damage * (1 + (arrow damage/N)) <P>where N = a value to be determined by investigation. Let's assume that N = a constant value, e.g. 10 for illustration. <P>So using a Trueshot / Raincaller and 3 dam. arrows <P>max = 20 * (1 + (3/10)) <BR>max = 20 * (1.3) <BR>max = 26 <P>...and with 8 damage arrows max will be 36 (instead of 28 currently) <P>Assuming a 'best case scenario' (i.e. a ranger with a bow actually contributing some real damage) the values with an Efreeti War Bow are : <P>max = 40 * (1+(3/10)) <BR>max = 40 * 1.3 <BR>max = 52 <P>max = 40 * (1+ (8/10)) <BR>max = 40 * 1.8 <BR>max = 72 <P>In this case N is a simple constant value, but this might be some variable derived from skill level, dex, even bow damage itself ...or a combination of these factors. <P>In addition the minimum damage of any bow / arrow combination should be the damage of the arrow used. i.e. a 3 damage arrow will always hit for a minimum of 3 points, up to the max damage. <P>So for our example above the base damage range is 3-26 or 8-36 instead of 1-23 or 1-28 with a Raincaller (3-52 or 8-72 with an Efreeti War Bow). This would make 8 damage arrows (~1pp per shot) a more worthwhile investment without scaling the damage unreasonably. <P>An alternative, more simple solution would be <P>max damage = bow damage + (2* arrow damage) <P>I accept that it will never be a primary combat skill - Verant have always been very firm on that point as non-melee damage is 'low risk' (although pulling Lvl 51+ mobs with arrows can change your perception of 'low risk') - the suggested damage model keeps the damage below that which we are capable of in melee in normal use. <P>In Trueshot mode I believe the damage should be more than we are capable of in melee for a short period of time, assuming equal skill levels and that we land a similar number of hits. FYI The Trueshot disc lasts 2 minutes from activation. This is usually longer than the fight (unless you're in Velious). <P>The benefit of scaling the damage according to a factor based on arrow damage is to increase the payback on the higher damage arrows really... just so you can feel that you're getting value for your plat. <P>There might also be some consideration given to target size vs. damage. It should be easier to hit a target like a giant or a dragon, however the damage modifier might be less.  As a competent archer in RL I find it frustrating that I 'miss' a target the size of a barn door at a range of 20 yards, when IRL I can place a 12" group into a target at 50 yards in a crosswind - on a good day at least  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ah, this is the thread I've been waiting on for almost a month.  Most of my ideas have already been covered, but I would like to explain why I think these following changes are valid.<P>1. Ranger defense should be raised to a skill of 230.  For every point of post 50 offense a Shadow Knight, Bard, or Paladin gets, Rangers should get an equal increase to defense, especially considering the changes that have been made on test.  Should they go live, there is No Reason not to up the inherent AC of the Ranger Class.  With the exception of Druids and Int Based Casters, Rangers have the lowest AC Class Armor in the game (Kunark and Velious Armor comes to mind).<P>2. The proc on the Epic Weapon Earthcaller should at least allow the DoT component to stick even when the mob is slowed.  As it is, Rangers are scurrying to find comparable ratio weapons to use in most group situations.  As it is, all the proc does in a group is add unnecessary Aggro without benefitting the group in any way.  (I always have an Enchanter and Shaman present in my groups, so slows are well handled).<P>3. I'd like to see the Tracking Fixes sometime soon.  That's already in the works though.<P>4. Trueshot Discipline is horribly inneffective.  In fact, it suffers from several problems.  a) There is no increased chance of a critical hit.  To date, using the discipline, I've scored 7 criticals total.  I score more than that bow kiting the average mob.  b) There needs to be a minimum damage on the discipline.  Hitting for 1 with a 45 damage bow and 8 damage arrows is ludicrous.  c) Regardless of what bow I use, Trueshot should allow me to deal more damage for 2 minutes than I would straight up meleeing with my Epic Weapons, otherwise the discipline provides no added utility to the class.<P>5. Of all the things listed above, this is the big one.  The other changes don't matter to me, but this does more than anything else.  Remove the mana cost penalty from our spells.  Given our limited mana pool, all this penalty does is hinder our ability to use our group friendly spells effectively.<P>Thanks,<P>Khross<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I may be to late for my opinion but I am posting it anyway. We are looking for group balance, and as I understand  it is a combination of Items of the ranger which is valuable to the group. I have been everything from puller to healer in the groups I have played in but I have consistantly noticed that our druid spells are so low leveled for the level we are that they normally are ineffective. Channeling levels should be increased, along with med skill. A dot that really did damage, it is embarrassing to use a dot that level 15 shamen laugh at. And swarm at 39 is really poor. Especially since the damage output is so low. <BR>I read the post here and I wonder how many rangers still snare as soon as they pull at higher levels. I have found that I preferr not to use  it until the end of a fight as it is almost always resisted ( wasting mana) and that most players I group with seem to root the mobs as soon as they can. <BR>Many things that have been added makes it dificult to speak about balance because little changes can cause big changes in the game. But assuming our real role is group support, I will not make anyother suggestions now</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Ok, first of all I do not know how you read all of this Absor, my hat is off to you. I think that this discussion is long overdue as many of us made the decision on our classes over a year ago with almost no idea of what was to come and by changing and tweaking the rolls will not change the classes we play due to the time invested, but may change whether we play. That being said I am not going to try not to rehash what everyone else has said, most of them have said it more eloquently or with better data than I could ever manage. I do think their points are valid and many bugs ought to be fixed, IMHO before anything else is done. However, I would like to call a couple of things out that I have not seen mentioned much. I will be the first to admit that some of the things I am submitting may be half baked and I know I will not be able to effectively convey my points, but perhaps I may say something that makse sense to someone.<P>First of all I would like to make a reference to the Warrior threads and how a couple of them commented, that one of the best things that they could do for the Warrior class was to fix Rangers. They said this in combination with complaining about their taunting abilities versus our damage taunting abilities. Most Rangers I know do as much as they can to avoid drawing agro. What does this mean, joining the fight a little later than the other meelee classes, not casting spells and backing out every once in a while when they perceive that they might be outdamaging the main tank. I do not know about you, but someone afraid of doing too much damage seems counter productive to me.<P>At the same time, I do not believe that we should get direct AC increases and if we do get a HP bonus, I believe that alll of the meelee classes should get similiar increases (Yes I know, not going to happen due to the original world). At the same time I agree with many of the posters that instead of AC we should get raises in Riposte and Dodge (Not touching evade, hehe) Wearing lighter armor is supposed to increase our agility and this seems more in line with at least my vision of the ranger. Additional agility on our armor would also make sense in this framework. Other than that, it might be nice to see some sort of ability like intimidation (I believe that this was originally in beta, but I am not sure how it was implemented) come in that would work to move us down on the aggro list. It could be as simple as we have a chance to subtract a little aggro every few seconds. The amount subtracted, would not equal the amount gained through normal combat in the same time, but still would be enough to not put us so insanely high on the aggro list. My last thought on the subject, would be the ability to turn off attack and put all of our energy into dodging/parrying much as the . It does take us down on the damage dealing list, but it would allow us to distract a mob while our compatriots continued doing damage and should overall increase the damage taken versus damage dealt ratio. This has some of the aspects of the level 60 Discipline WeaponShield, but would be no where as powerful and would be based on a skill rather than a timer.<P>Another minor thing that I have not seen much of, yet seems very relevant was the reasoning behind raising the experience modifiers in many dungeon zones. Aradune stated that it was being done to get more people into the higher risk/reward areas. However, Rangers (and druids for the record) lose most of their abilities when inside. A large number of our spells are outside only and tracking is next to useless due to the range of most mobs that show up and the fact that often the mob is through many walls when we see it (yes, many of the planned tracking improvements will help this). I believe that raising our Hide and Sneak abilities would help slightly to counter this as then we would at least have the ability to scout a bit, maybe even find the mob.<P>I also agree with many of the other posters who have said that Rangers do not need the spells that they are getting at lower levels on the test server. Yes, they are nice, but at those levels a ranger is still a viable part of a group and not the masochistic manasink that they become at higher levels. <P><BR>I would like to end this post with a couple of general points that probably belong elsewhere, but as long as all of these things are being mentioned, I believe they should be looked at. Two big things with Spells are I believe there should be a more diverse set of Spell Gems and the limit of 15 buffs has not kept up with the advances in the number of available Buffs. Also as a couple of other posters have noted every <BR>every class had/has a speciality, some of these have been been changed with recent upgrades and I think it is interesting that those that are complaining the most are the ones which feel those defining combat rolls being impinged upon or lacked a decent ability to begin with.<P>Warrior = Critical hits and weapon/armor choice<BR>Monk = Feign Death/Low equipment needs<BR>Rogue = Backstab/Evade<BR>Bard = Song for nearly every occasion?<BR>Shadow Knight = Harm Touch<BR>Paladin = Lay on Hands<BR>Ranger = Track?<P>Magician = Summon<BR>Enchanter = Illusion<BR>Wizard = Damage<BR>Necromancer = Summon Corpse?<P>Cleric = Healing<BR>Shaman = Buff<BR>Druid = Port?<P>In my opinion these rolls should be expanded on or redefined to make everyone an attractive part of a group without redusing their ability to feel special.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Wow!  I hope you get this far, and find my suggestions reasonalby well thought out and flame-free!<P>Overall I think Rangers are in pretty good shape, except with regard to the end game, and certain idiosyncrasies (Rogues tank better than rangers?!?!?!).  The following are what I see as tweaks for Ranger balance.  Bugs and balance tweaks both discussed. Short versions here, justification arguments below:<P>Archery:  Fix arrow ‘poofing’ bug.  Eliminate or widen the range for the “target is too” high or low issue.  Let us do some sort of respectable damage with archery.  5 damage arrows should do 5 points of damage minimum, not 1.  Why can’t Rangers get crippling blows with bows if warriors can?  Boy oh boy is fletching expensive for very little gain in either combat or economics.  <P>Melee:  Triple whammy on defense is too harsh (low AC, low HP and low defense caps).  Maybe the low AC and low HP can be left alone, but at least boost our defensive caps.  We are light, agile, chain-wearing fighters, let us avoid some of the hits.  Sometimes we HAVE to tank.  Bump defense to 215 or 220, riposte to 180 or 190, and dodge to 140 - 150.  We have a caster’s defensive capabilities and yet are a front-line class.<P>Casting: In general leave alone.  But if it is intended that casting make up for our weak defense, then we need stronger spells earlier.<P>Tracking:  The changes Rowyl outlined sound GREAT when can we have ‘em?<P>Archery: <BR>Arrow's poofing - fix it, please.  It’s VERY annoying to spend lots of plat on higher level arrows just to have them disappearing.<P>The "target too far above or below you" as implemented doesn't make sense.  If a Ranger can cast line of sight spells on the monster, then he should be able to hit it with an arrow.  Not that the altitude restriction has no place but it needs to be opened up -- a lot.  That mammoth is on a hill shorter than a Ranger is tall and he’s too far above the Ranger?  But the Ranger can snare him, DOT him, or DD him so the Ranger should be able to hit him with a bow as well.  Archery should have the same line-of-sight capabilities as spell casting, does especially given the miniscule damage it does compared spells.<P>Speaking of damage, can Rangers get a little better bow damage please?  Not a lot, just enough to make archery (one of Rangers ‘defining skills’) a bit more useful in the low and mid levels, before the Trueshot discipline arrives?  Perhaps a damage bonus similar to melee weapons.  I don’t see how applying such a damage bonus will unbalance the game. In contrast, we have wizards and druids quad kiting and blasting the daylights out of monsters from a distance.  The relative slow speed of archery would not allow it to become replacement for melee.  But it would make stepping back out of a group fight and peppering the monster with arrows a viable option to compensate for the Ranger’s current inability to stand in there and take it.  <P>As it is, with archery not being a significant part of the Vision and not being a viable damage-dealing tool why is it so expensive?  I spend A LOT of plat working on fletching and it seems the expense is not commensurate with the reward.  However, I would much rather keep the expense and have archery made more useful.<P>How can 5 damage arrows hit for 1 point.  By default if it hits I should get at least 5 if not 6.  <P>Warriors get critical and crippling hits for archery and Rangers only get criticals.  This appears hard to justify.  Rangers shouldn’t begrudge the Warriors their criticals and crippling blows in archery, but Rangers should get both of them too.  It’s that whole ‘defining skill’ thing; the bow and arrow is a Ranger’s logo after all.  The Ranger’s archery cap should be higher than that of any of the other classes.<P>Melee:<P>I understand and can accept that Rangers are supposed to be a damage dealing class (offense-based as opposed to defense-based), but there are still some issues, even taking that into consideration.  I think that it is important to understand that offense-based classes’ defense CAN be set too low.  Whether it actually IS or not is debatable.  But that fact that the possibility exists needs to be accepted.  (The converse is true well: defensive classes’ offense CAN be set too low, but whether it IS or not is open to debate.)<P>Rangers get a QUADRUPLE whammy against them in defense: low defensive skill caps, low Armor Class (natural), lower Armor Class items, and low hit points.  For convenience sake I’m grouping the two AC issues and just saying low AC.  The combination of these three strikes against Ranger’s defensive abilities is just too much when combined.  Any two of the three might be justified, but adding the third pushes us below where Rangers should be.  I think a slight improvement in HP and AC, and a more pronounced improvement in defensive skills is warranted.<P>It is an issue of damage avoidance versus damage absorption.  By avoidance, I mean how likely a given attack is to hit, and absorption is how much the damage from the hit is reduced.  Rangers should NOT be able to absorb much more damage than they currently do.  That is to say, they are not tanks, standing there and taking hits.  But Rangers should be able to avoid damage a lot more than they currently do as lightly armored agile fighters.  No, I don’t want to be a tank, but I don’t think we should be paper tigers like caster’s either.  The Rangers 200 defense cap is the SAME as a druid’s!  We should be able to avoid damage better, though not necessarily absorb damage better, than a druid does.<P>With regard to Armor Class I’m a bit stumped as to how much it applies to avoidance and how much it applies to absorption.  If it could be changed such that the avoidance was increased, without affecting absorption, that would be great.  In terms of Armor Class, Rangers should be well below Warriors, Shadow Knights and Paladins.  Rangers should be above (or at the very least on par with) Rogues/Bards/Monks.  (Not really sure where the monks fit in.)  As it is Rogues, a back-stabbing class, have better toe to toe melee capabilities than Rangers.  That just shouldn’t be.  Rogues also get additional defense mitigating skills Evade and Instill Doubt. Rangers should be hands down above the casting classes in Armor Class with the POSSIBLE exception of a Cleric.<P>Hit Points for Rangers should probably be below Warriors, Shadow Knights, and Paladins.  But we should be on par with the other melee types.  And we should be well above casters being less fragile warrior types.<P>In the area of the defensive skills, Rangers should not trail the Warrior, Paladin, and Shadow Knight by as far they do.  We have already taken heavy hits in terms of Armor Class and Hit Points.  In this single area we should nearly match the Warrior, Paladin and Shadow Knight.  The defensive skills fall into the avoidance category and I believe these caps should be raised accordingly (defense, dodge, parry, riposte). .  Bump defense to 215 or 220, riposte to 180 or 190, and dodge to 140 - 150.  In particular, riposte has a damage dealing aspect that being offense based we should tap inot.  We have a caster’s defensive capabilities and yet are a front-line class.  Change these.<P>Bottom line is Rangers need a bit of improvement in melee defense.  Improvement in at least ONE of the three areas discussed (HP, AC, Defensive skill caps) would do the trick.  Or possibly a SMALL improvement in each area would do the trick.  I happen to believe that the defensive skill caps are the best place to make changes based on what a Ranger is all about.  Improvements to either HP or AC may work to also help balance the Rangers as melee class, as long as they are minor.<P>If a Ranger can’t stay in the fight long enough to deal the damage he is capable of because of his poor defense what good is he to a group.  Ranger’s lack of defense prevents their offense from being effective.  Rangers can’t outdamage Warriors by much, if at all, even if they didn’t have to back out of the fight.  And when the Ranger backs out he’s not doing damage, which is what Rangers do.  All this is less of an issue with a full group, but becomes a huge issue with groups of 2 – 4.  (Where they are likely the main tank, having formed their own small group of misfits, because other groups want a Rogue, Monk, or Warrior.  Over-heard in a Vox raid:  “All tanks report, Monks, Rogues, Pallys, SKs and Warriors” and later, “No not Rangers, tanks”.)  It is laughable that Rogues are considered better tanks than Rangers.  That should not be.  A sneaky back-stabbing class tanks better than a Ranger?!?!  And NO I am NOT saying nerf Rogues, more power to them.  Rangers just want some improvement in defense so they can be competitive for spots in a group with the Rogue, Monks and Warriors.<P>Of course instead of making a relative minor change of increasing the defensive caps, some of the melee issues could be improved by increasing our offense.  As the offensive hybrid, we should be near the top of the damage output lists.  As it stands, we are near the bottom for BOTH offense and defense.  As a rough example, if we can only stand and fight half as long as a Paladin, we should be able to do at least twice the damage for that period of time.  I believe that Rangers offense is fine, we just need tweaks in the THREE defensive areas we are penalized in.<P>I do understand the argument that we have casting abilities that should offset the defensive penalties.  But frankly they can’t make up for the triple hit we take with low AC, HP and defensive caps.  For the most part the spells are under powered for our level and the level of monsters we are facing when we get the spells.  Speaking of spells.<P><BR>Casting:<P>Well spells could make up the offensive improvements for a third option under melee (improve offense).  But quite frankly our offensive spells are fairly under whelming by the time we get them, and nearly worthless by the time we get an upgrade (under whelming swarm 117 dam DOT at LVL30, worthless ignite 37 dam DD upgraded at 39).  I only mean worthless in terms of offsetting our melee disadvantages.  In general, I think spells are fine, they only fall short and come too late if they are supposed to compensate for Ranger’s relative fragility as a melee class.<P>Defensive spells seem to be okay, but again they don’t adequately offset our melee defensive shortfalls.<P>Overall I think spells are okay.  Earlier (or upgraded versions) would be nice, but the defensive caps would serve better and be easier to implement.<P>Some half hearted casting suggestions:<P>Perhaps SOW earlier at 30.<P>See invis would be nice to go with our camo.<P>Stacking issues with strength spells – berserker strength proc overwrote strength of earth again – AAAAARRRGGHH!<P>Tracking:<BR>The changes Rowyl outlined several weeks ago should handle any Ranger my complaints about tracking, which I repeat here for reference, and will be awesome!<P>Can’t track something right next to me but can find it across the zone.  Too much clutter can’t filter or scroll through the list.  The better Rangers get at tracking, the less useful it becomes.<P>RANGERS DON’T NEED:<BR>Self-bind (anymore than any other melee class)<BR>Self-TP (anymore than any other melee class)<BR>A pet (um, Rangers hunt and kill animals, perhaps not wantonly, but we do nonetheless).<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Remove the disarm skill, it's a joke. There are 55 points into it, take 20 of them, and give us 20 defense, put the other 25 into something like a safe fall, or something usefull like that.<BR>Lower the level of the spell jolt, and give it the resistnace of a lure, that way there is a chance it can still get resisted, but it won't get resisted as much now (casting it on a level 1 rat 20 times and having it resisted 3 times at level 55 isn't good).<BR>Put the stone for the epic on another mob, that drops only the stones, or that is triggered. Venril Sathir also dropes kunark leg armor and other items, so he is usually killed for those, and the average of 2-4 guilds per server that can kill him, get the stones that they can use, then usually keep the rest, either for twinks or sell them for large amounts of money, but keep killing him for the other items. Also a 1 week spawn time is a bit long, seeing how the stones are needed by rangers AND druids. Also make them useable in either hand.<BR>Give us a non-fire based nuke, or a better AE that also works indoors.<BR>Raise hitpoints at level 60 by 300-400.<BR>If we have the same ofensive capabilities as warriors, our kicks should stun at 55+ like warriors.<BR>Increase drop rate of thorny armor in fear. I've been on 4 fear raids, I've seen 3 comeplete sets of SK armor drop, 1 and a half paladin, 2 druid, 1 wizard, necro, and monk with lots of repeat peaices, and only 2 ranger items, 1 bracer and 1 helm. I've heard from others who've been on more that this is common for rates.<BR>Add some armor in PoG (wether it be quests or drops) for those that don't worship tunare. If you plan on putting it in PoM, fine, but finish the zone and put it in an easier location to get to, and idiot and his cousin can walk into PoG, but putting PoM past at least 10 level 63+ kos mobs wans't bright(although i think they put it there to say it was accesable and in the game, even though it wasn't done).<P>Durendanna Dreamwalker<BR>55th level ranger, Prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've read a lot of the posts, and I see many good ideas.  Though more HP's and AC is asked for often, I don't think this will happen; however, increased dodge and parry would seem like a viable alternative.  Upgrading archery is fine, and maybe even doing away with LoS once your skill is maxed would be nice.  I still like the idea of evade or a low level Jolt-type spell.  Evac . . . I'm not sure on that, but post 50 I don't see why not, honestly.  Although, I would rather see something more creative that was "class specicfic" and in-line with our "role" rather than feeding off a parent--though I have no suggestions as of yet.  (Maybe an upgrade to Feet like cat that increased movement also /shrug).<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think the changes implemented on Test are a fantastic set of adjustments. I have a few suggestions.<P>1. Increase duration of Feet like Cat to match Strength of Earth. This would just be convienient, shouldn't be a big issue balance wise.<P>2. Riposite and Disarm. Just from a role-play/reality perspective, these 2 weapons skills are going to be best performed by nimble fighters with light, swift blades. Someone with a huge  axe or 2 handed sword may be able to pound someone hard enough to dislodge their weapon, but primarily this is going to occur when you are able to put your oponents weapon into some kind of bind or slash through their guard to damage their hands. Likewise with riposte, reaction time, being able to take advantage of that split second opening that your defense has created would seem to favor nimble, speedy weapons.<P>3. Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems to me that using a whip is much more complex than weilding a sword. Maybe Rangers should only be able to use them in our primary hands, leave it to the more heavily weapon trained Warriors to be able to use them in either hand.<P>4. I've tried to think of other things you could take away from Rangers so this wouldn't be just "gimmee gimmee gimmee" but the things I can think of are spells so trivial that why bother, or things so "cruicial" (like getting SOW at 39) that it would be crippling. Maybe remove 2hs weapon skill except for ranger only weapons, maybe same for piercing?<P>While I think that caster types should have more restrictions on where they can bind, I don't think Rangers have any business with bind or gate abillities. I would love to see a 1000 plat potion similar to the Gate potion that would allow binding in outdoor areas.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>From the point of view of a high lvl shadow knight, who also plays a lvl 30 ranger :<P>- Other hybrid receive their most class-defining spells at lvl 30. Feign Death and Invisibility for SKs, a decent heal and 1st Stun for paladins, it would be only fair that rangers, as masters of outdoors scouting & travel, should get Spirit of Wolf at 30 also.<P>- If you up the defensive caps of pallies/SKs to 252, it seems only fair you up the ranger Defensive cap to 227 or 230, the current offensive cap for SKs/pallies. Rangers are already heavily handicapped in their defense abilities by very low HPs, less AC on their class armor, and pretty low caps in Dodge/Riposte/Parry. Isn't that enough already ?<P>- Jolt needs to be given at 49 or 51 at the least, and made less resistable so it's actually worth casting. Nothing can resist a rogue's Evade skill, tho it may fail, in comparison. As it is, I don't see rangers using Jolt much, while rogues resort to Evade all the time. Guess what is working right, and what is in need of an upgrade here...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>DarkAdept,<BR>   While I value your opinion I think you are looking at it from a very narrow point of view.  That being that "YOU" as an SK don't seem to have trouble keeping a mob off a Ranger.  Let me explain why this is a case.  <P>Arguably, the only skill a ranger brings to a dungeon group is our ability to SNARE mobs so they don't run off and bring back friends, and if you have your epic, to SLOW mobs to 50%.  With a SK in the group, with MUCH higher AC and HP, the ranger allows the SK to snare (darkness line) to keep the mobs attention squarely on the SK.  If the Ranger were to be the "snarer" you might have a more difficult time keeping the mobs on you as snare and ensnare are mega taunts.  Especially if the Ranger is using his "new" procing spells which are also big taunts.<P>Now lets look at that same group with a warrior as the main tank (this is the case 90% of the time BTW).  The ranger is expected to snare, as he can take the hits SLIGHTLY better than the druid in the group, or will be the snarer if there is no druid in the group.  In this case, the ranger snares, moving him to the very top of the hate list.  Wait til later in the fight to snare you say?  Well what if you get resisted or fizzle (both of which are not uncommon on 50+ mobs).  It then runs off and it's time for an EVAC if your group has an evacer.<P>Why not cast Jolt immediately after you snare?  Simple, at 51-54 we don't have it!  During these levels a ranger really feels like a heel in dungeon encounters.  If I snare, I get agroed, if I get agroed, I die or become a mana leach.  The only option at this point is to turn off auto attack and back out of combat, and hope the warrior can taunt off, at which point we are not fulfilling our role as a "damage dealer".  <P>Now imagine the Ranger IS 55+ and has jolt.  He snares at 25-50% health (depending on how fast the group is killing the mob), it turns on him and he casts Jolt.  It is resisted, causing extra taunt.  (meanwhile cleric is chain healing)  He casts again, this time it sticks, but guess where it goes, to the warrior taunting or the cleric chain healing??  You guessed it, the cleric.  The ranger now has to taunt off the cleric to save the group, in so doing, he can't Jolt, lest he put the mob back on the cleric, so he has to stand there until the warrior can taunt off (which doesn't work very well on 55+ mobs I might add).<P>So once again, as a shadow knight with the ability to snare a mob, you shouldn't see this problem (if the ranger in your group is worth his salt he'll let you snare to keep the agro).<P>-Mirk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>Mirklin, you don't need rocket science to understand that if you don't cast Snare at the very beginning of a fight you drastically lower the chances of getting too high on a Hate.<P>As a SK, when I group with a ranger I have no problem letting him Snare so I can concentrate on other types of DoTs than the Darkness line. At the very least I make him understand that he must leave me time to build agro, 1/3 or halfway into the fight, before snaring, so he doesn't get beaten to pulp with no chance for me to Taunt the mob back.<P>As you say, it's a good thing to understand group dynamics from another member's point of view.

</FONT><HR>Mythral,<BR>   With the proposed changes on test, with a ranger having equivalent offence to a warrior (therefore doing equivalent damage or very very close until the warrior gets triple attack), the ranger will be VERY near the top of the hate list for the duration of the battle.  If he snares at ANY point he will get agroed, there is little doubt in my mind.  The exception to this is if a Paladin or SK is the main tank, they have the ability to taunt via spells, and can get the mobs attention back quicker than a warrior would (who is the main tank now 90% of the time).  This means that 90% of the time where a ranger is expected to snare, he NEEDS a way to shed the agro quickly.  Grouping with SKs and Paladins, this doesn't seem to be nearly as bad (in fact with SKs, it's hardly ever a problem).<P>-Mirk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One tracking aspect, if a group member dies while we are in the zone we can track their corpse. If they zone in we lose that entry in tracking, if we weren't in zone when they died we lose it, if we have to zone we don't have the entry when we come back. This seems a little spotty for behavior. As part of the tracking changes can this be made consistant one way or another? Either we can track corpses or not, from a RP perspective it makes sense "Here's where his trackes ended, there's the body" but those are Necro & Bard (do SKs get that spell) areas.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055211-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055211.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055211-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055211-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055211-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055211-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055211&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=055211&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
