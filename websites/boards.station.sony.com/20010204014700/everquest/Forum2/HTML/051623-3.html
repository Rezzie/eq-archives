</FONT><HR>When Veeshan was split to Saryrn many people who correctly entered the movelog command were not moved. As a result, I was seperated by server from my family member. We were told by several sources 'too bad' or it would take 'divine intervention' to get moved.<P>Well, if it was so easy to do this test character transfer TWICE, then why couldn't my family member have been moved to Saryrn when he correctly entered the movelog command? I really feel that at that time customer service should have moved the character instead of insisting that none would be moved. Rating CS on this issue I hand out the 'very unsatisfied'.<P>Now this just proves how easy it really is to do a character transfer. It also erodes my faith in VI by being told how difficult these transfers are and then seeing someone do it so easily. Not that I ever believed for a second it was at all difficult. I bet all they have to do is fire up their DB app, query my account, and change some 0 to a 1. But Noooooooooooooooooooooooo...they'd rather a newbie character get started instead.<P>P<P>Odid<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Actually all this does is teach any internal Verant Twinkie that if you want to illegally move uber-buffed/uber-twinked chars, move them to an old server that is filled with foreign players. After all, this guy only got exposed because he just stood out too much in a very "young" server in which the circle of "uber" players was still small enough for high level players to know who got what. After all how many planes capable guild are in Veeshan for instance?<P>Another corollary to this fact is of course, the twinky was stupid enough to transfer to TT where he was easily caught (and by being too obnoxious to boot). How many uber-transfers have happened to the mature servers like the Marr, Veeshan etc. undetected?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think the problem is much more extensive than they let on and the thing is, a lot of upper management (or occurs with their consent) is involved. This is the reason why we have so many suspicious sightings of uber-buffed characters showing up now and then. This is actually quite interesting. Players want char transfers, VI (or GMs) management wants to cheat with uber-chars. Guess who gets to do what they want?<P>Why not set up a monty haul server for VI management twinky chars? Ooops, I forgot - they want out of the test server with with an unfair advantage over the paying marks (customers).<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Now if a player is caught doing something wrong, or a gm doesnt like something they do they are suspended or banned, i hope some action is taken against the people that cheat on your side, or do you just let it slide for your employees.  Just once it would be nice if Verant wasnt so two faced when it comes to there policies, you are so quick to judge other people with your banning's and suspension.

</FONT><HR>I can't believe that people would tolerate cheaters on their server. If its so fine and dandy, why the hell did Verant admit wrongdoing and correct it? Are you so mentally deficient and morally bankrupt that you don't understand?<P>If I was playing Monopoly with 5 people, and one guy was bribing the bank guy to give him more money than the rest of us, I would be upset. If someone is rigging the roulette wheel at Las Vegas while 10 people are playing it, I wouldn't just stand there and smile and keep playing. If I was playing on a Quake server, and one guy is running around with quad and invulnerability, does it make sense to just smile and keep playing? <P>Everquest IS a competative game, you compete with other people for resources. When you stop killing fire beetles, and start playing the upper game, you'll understand that there are MOBs to fight and their loot to get as the end reward of this game. The game is ABOUT levels and loot. When you devalue the main point of the game by just handing this stuff out and condoning cheaters, you devalue the work that people put into the game. <P>If you spend your time at your job busting your ass to be the best in your office, you surpass all sales quotas, you expand your districts, and increase revenues, and when it comes time to name Salesman of the Year, they give the same reward to everyone, and plaques to everyone calling them Salesman of the Year, does it feel like all the time and effort you put in was worth anything?<P>I don't know how I can put it any plainer. I know that's a hard concept for people who really have no clue how the game turns out, and still think that scary West Karana is the end of the world. But EQ IS competative, its like Q2 with teams and strategy, and fewer twitch reflex wins. <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have to agree with the other poster that the MAIN effect of this event is that your playing community loses trust in the GMs and company management when someone thwarts company policy this way.  The LAST thing GMs need is less trust by the players.  Shame on the ones who did this.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Which in turn resulted in a promise to cease and desist with the artificial buffin, equippin and the like.<P>The next logical step?<P>Artificially buff and equip more characters on the test then allow them to be moved to a live server.<P>In the real world of IT, admins would be fired for granting excess rights to end-users. <P>VI = Joke company with a punch-line for an infrastructure.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/051623-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/051623.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/051623-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=051623&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=051623&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
