</FONT><HR>You can read the previous discussion here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/055864.html<BR>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056034.html<BR>And here: http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056290.html<P>Author Topic: Necromancer Talk <BR>Absor<BR>Station Member posted 02-07-2001 10:08 AM <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>So let's talk about necromancers.<BR>As with all the other threads, I want to talk about class balance here, not about bugs or epic weapons. You may certainly present bugs and concerns about the epic weapons, but they will not be the main concern of this thread.<P>Unlike the other threads, I have a fairly good list of ideas already garnered from several other posts to start us out. It is not complete, I'm sure. But it is certainly a good place to start our discussion.<P>Also, we are not looking to make necromancers any more effective at soloing than they already are. And, well, the necromancer is a pretty powerful class as they are now. The primary issues that I see revolve around the battle with the boss monsters. But I certainly want to hear from necromancers with concerns about all levels of the game. And, once again, I have to warn you that since we will be looking closely at this class we may very well feel that something needs to have its power reduced to achieve balance.<P>Anyhow, here's what I have already.<P>Ignite Bones: Despite the coolness factor, this spell can't really be used on the big raids because it suddenly pulls the enemy out of range, and by the time you relocate your range, one warrior could conceivably have done more damage than the spell is going to do. The best solution is to make the skeleton match the monster, if we can find some way to do that. Fixing this one spell might solve a lot of concerns. If we can’t size the skeleton, then we probably should remove it and find some other cool way to make sure that the spell 'sticks' to the target to prevent chain casting and to make it more than just another DD. Note: Any change to this spell should also be made to Chill Bones (55).<P>Lifetaps: The number one request is to allow Lifetaps to land on the big monsters. If we are telling necromancers that they have a valid place at the final encounter because they can give mana to other casters, then they will need a way to regain mana. Lich and Lifetap are the way they do that now. I am not convinced that this is something that we should change. But this is the single most asked for thing by the necromancer community. Perhaps, if made in conjunction with the fixing the bug in Lich, then perhaps this could be balanced.<P>DoTs and corpse poofing: This affects everyone. Hopefully this is now much improved, but I’m not taking it off the list until I’m convinced it has been fixed.<P>Mana transfer: Again, if their ‘place’ against the boss mob is to transfer mana, then perhaps we should allow them to do it at a better rate. A 2:1 transfer rate might be enough. I'm not at all certain that this should be done in conjunction with any change to Lifetaps in those encounters, though, as a change in one makes the other far more effective and might just be too much of a change. But this could certainly be considered if we fix the bug with the Lich spells.<P>Infusion: Make infusion targetable. The necro might still see it as a 'worthless spell', but if another caster wants to sacrifice their experience for 1000 mana, they might actually cast this spell. Otherwise, those Essence Emerald’s will only be used for raising the dead.<P>Defoliation: There seem to be plenty of plants that this just doesn't work on. I fully understand how we need to limit the use of any spell that is overly efficient against any one monster type. But it might be worthwhile to evaluate the things that are not considered plants that maybe should be. I've asked the players for a list that they'd like reviewed, but I've received nothing yet.<P>Track Corpse: Broken spell. Is it going to stay that way?<P>Epic Weapon: The look and effect are not well loved in the community.<P>Lich Series: This series of spells is broken. It is more powerful than it should be. It takes the necromancer's hit points and turns them into mana. It was calculated at a certain ratio to be 'in balance'. Unfortunately, these spells were adversely affected by the reduction of damage to spells used by players on players. This change also reduced the hit points taken from the necromancer by Lich spells, so that the ratio of mana gained for hit points lost is nearly 1 for 1 (instead of about 3 for 2). This is a bug that we have chosen not to change in the past because it would be a 'nerf'. I think in conjunction with a serious look at the entire class and the balance of all the classes, we should also look at this series and decide if we should put it right. If it remains as it is, the necromancer is going to be limited in the improvements it can gain, as the class is already using a powerful and broken spell series. Note: Series includes: Arch Lich (60), Demi Lich (60), Lich (49), Call of Bones (34), Allure of Death (20).<P>Alan<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I thought about this some more. We all know solo necros are a tad over powered. They also group well in 6 player groups. I am comfortable to lose a little solo ability to gain some ability against uber mobs.<P>Also this is good for balance. Whats the use guys of making 60 in excruciatingly fast time if no one wants us at the end.<P>At 60 this game is about ubers. The question really is if we lose the 1:1 on litch what do we gain.<P>I would like the lifetap and lifetap dots to stick. Also make the debuff unresistable or add a 60 line thats unresistable. <P>The dots would help 1 and only 1 necro so they arent that valuable. They cant upgrade screaming touch because as it is that one spell makes us wanted for grouping. Well maybe 1 more upgrade but I doubt they will.<P>The point is if we have to give to get and they show us what we lose and gain we can vote on it.

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Lots has been said, you don't want us to be more powerful solo. Here's a quick idea that literally came to me at 3 this morning.<P>Let our pets strength multiply as group members are added.<P>If we wish to solo, still the same old pet. However, if we get into a full group on a raid we can draw HPs/mana, whatever from the group to make a large pet. Let me give a possible preview -<P>Lunara is grouped with three people now and loses the pet she was soloing with.<P>Lunara casts Minion of Shadows.<BR>Lunara casts Power Pet.<P>Lunara loses 2 bars of health.<BR>groupmember2 loses 2 bars of health.<BR>groupmember3 loses 2 bars of health.<P>A larger pet appears.<P>Becomes interesting then. If the pet dies on a bad pull, do you cast another and take health from your tanks? Do you leave the group and cast a solo pet, but lose the xp. Dont allow us to leave a group, make a pet and join the group again. If we leave we're out till the fight is over.<P>I could stay with our current spell line up with this one addition.  I can solo if I want, but the incentive is there to group and we become SO much more useful. Those of us wanting to fight in the front lines on a raid, now have that option to do so.<P>Make it a post 50 spell if you like. Make our pets mean something again post 50. :/ <P>Thank you for your time,<P>Lunara Silvershade<BR>E'ci<BR>53rd Necromancer<BR>Alliance of Darkness<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

We all have expansions, don't we ?<P>Let's trade necromancer overpowered misconception (level 1 to 40) with better balanced power and fix completely ludicrous spells after level 50+ and their uselessness along with drop rate.<P>Please please do NERF level 1-40 pets.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Simply..<P>1)  Don't forget the little guys...a change that only has benfit for the 50+ crowd while making the lower levels that much more difficult is not BALANCING within ITS OWN CLASS let alone in the entire group of classes.  This relates specifically to addressing the changing of the Lich line impact.  (Which when the numbers are run even with the tap ability results in decreased mana available for transfer)<P>2)  Same new Pet spell abilities as granted to Mages.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Im playing everquest for the first time, and all these threads about Nerfing the low level Necro so that a few people 50+ up can do more against Uber Mobs is annoying. <P>The main reason I choose to play a Necro was the solo ability, I don't have time to play 24/7 and form all the bonds for group play.  With a Necro I can log on, play with or without a group and logout.  Chances are I'll never make level 50 and I'm sure most players never do. They either don't have the time, or get bored and play another class.  Don't make the casual player suffer so a few people can fight Uber Mobs on the planes and in velious.<P>Eldrehn<BR>16th Rank Necromancer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Because of pvp code Lich doesnt drain the amount of Hps it was originally intended for...so does that mean that Cannibalize and Mod rods are working as intended? I tried to read all the 16 pages or so of posts, but I wasn't sure if this was answered or not?<P>Its unfortunate that the way classes are "balanced", is by redistributing power...Soon all classes will be mediocre.  This is already happened.  Classes are not special anymore. At the level 50 cap there was something special about every class. But since the game was extended to 60th things changed. I remember an SK posting I want summon corpse and the response was "We feel Necros should only get that ability". I understand things should and will change, but the way they are changing is by giving classes each others abilities.  Classes are becoming "jack of all trades", Instead of Master of (insert here).<P><BR>Necros by "definition" should be able to deal damage over time better then anyone, lifetap and steal hps for mana and have a useful pet. It seems that Verant got sort of confused on what to do to Necros later on... The other night I was Healer/mana transfer role..I have played this role many times in Dungeons before, sometimes being the only healer...But this issue of not being able to lifetap "uber" mobs does leave us with little to do...Lich doesnt work to well without the BoD line of spells and the mana/transfer spells obviously dont either.<P>I find it odd comments like.."you are to powerful so we are going to nerf you"  Too powerful compared to what? Other classes? Other Mobs? If we are so powerful how come everyone doesn't quit thier character and make a Necro?  Because one class can solo doesn't mean they are too powerful, It just means they can solo.  If I play a class which requires a group to kill a mob, but I can bring something usefull to the group which no other class can, am I really less powerful? Does this make me "weak"?  Afraid not..For some reason the ability to solo in EQ equals too powerful..odd when this game is geared to grouping.  Wouldnt that make the best grouping type characters too Powerful? <P>This constant blurring of the classes has created this problem...all in the name of equality and balance.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I just want to feel needed in groups. Even if I didn't play a Necromancer, I would still think it is unfair that one class is unable to bring anything to a group. Soloing is so boring, and lonley. If we could do something that groups desired, we would be much better off. just because someone can solo, doesnt mean they should pay for it by not being able to group, look at Druids. They can solo just as well, if not better than us. However, they bring a lot to a group, this is all we want.

</FONT><HR>I have logged 100+ days playing 5 different necromancer characters, three of them over 40, and one who has done uber-raids.  I think I know a lot about how necromancers work when they work well.  I even remember the days of the 3:2 ratio on the Lich line. <P>Necromancers are easily the most self-sufficent class after the druid, and the most efficient soloists...again, after the druid.  And for most of their casting life, they are very effective in groups as an offensive pet caster, especially in small groups where we can fill a lot of different holes, sometimes simultaneosly.<P>If the necromancer were not a fun class to play, there is no way I would have logged 100+ hours on it.  <P>I have one and only one balance complaint: the necromancer has the most marginal role in large raids after the magician, and if the current test server changes go through for the magician without similar changes for the necromancer class, we will be the MOST marginal class on raids.  <P>I don't really have the same quarrel with becoming a support caster that a lot of my peers do.  My forte is the manipulation of the forces of life and death.  I can accept that some foes grip on life (or unlife, in the case of undead) is so strong that I can not hope to seriously harm them by direct manipulation.  I can accept that these foes are so strong that my summoned servants will be brushed aside like flies.  Although it REALLY bothers me when my mindless undead friends run away in fear.  What exactly are they suppossed to be afriad of?  Dying?<P>But at a roughly 2-1 transfer ratio (If I specialize in alteration), I make a pretty poor mana battery-and that's the only support role I have.  I can overcome this problem to a large extent by using lich/archlich, but ONLY if I can lifetap back my health.  This is especially true if the lich line is changed back to the 3:2 damage ratio.  Without the ability to recover my lost health, it ALWAYS makes sense to bring an extra enchanter or cleric instead, unless there is a dire shortage of one or the other.  <P>I guess what I would like to see to deal with this problem vs. high level mobs is for our lifetaps to land.  This way we can be both a decent mana battery (or HP battery) and a 2nd rate offensive caster.  I honestly do NOT understand why this is a 'balance issue' when a typical wizard will shell out twice as much damage as we do during the fight, a hybrid 4 times, a warrior 5 times or a rogue 10 times.  Necromancers would remain an 'optional' class on an uber-raid, they certainly would not move to the top of the list.<P>As another alternative, I would like to see a unique, desirable buff or two for high level necromancers.  By desirable buffs, I emphatically do not mean group DMF.  The idea is foolish.  DMF does not have a particualrly high mana cost as it is, when you consider it lasts 50+ minutes.  Necromancers are already in demand for DMF when DMF is needed, so a group version would solve no problem. It would be a waste of programming staff time to implement, time better spent making the non-levitate portions of DMF useable in zones like Kedge.<P>I was thinking more along the lines of a necromancer-style Hit point/AC buff.  For instance, a 'Transfer lifeforce' spell that buffed another char by 1000 hitpoints + 20 AC while simultaneously debuffing the necro with the 'resurrection effects' debuff or something along those lines.  <P>Finally, I'd like to see an upgrade to shadow vortex (a spell I think most other necromancers underuse).  I expect every raid would want at least one or two necromancers along just to keep the uber-mobbed affected by 'Vortex of Thule', This assumes L55+ mobs were not simply immune, in which case why bother to add such a spell?<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alan,<P>Background:  I am a lev 55 necro (ERU), started the first day the game was available in stores.  Here are my views and comments/suggestions.<P>Ignite Bones:  Your comments about the effect are indeed acurate.  While I doubt to see large mobs in every zone work correctly with the current effect (Turn into skeleton).  I think the time needed to make that happen is not worth the effort.  Just come up with a better effect to prevent chain casting.  Yes, should also effect Chill Bones (55).<P>Chill Bones:  Since we are talking about chill bones, it does seem a bit high level (55) for the spell.  Most people would take advantage of this spell earlier on and probabaly used most in Sol B.  Think about lowering the level on this one to benefit the level 51-53 crowd who may spend more time in Sol B than 55+.<P>Lifetaps:  On ANY encounter that we see with lifetap resists, a lot of our give mana/life to others break.  Your comments only talk about giving mana, while we can share our lifeforce as well.  Lower the resists so we can be more effective,  dumping mana and calling it a day is not fun.  I usually toss a heal to the cleric who is busy healing tanks, thats drains my life, and I need a way to get it back.  <P>Lich line:  Keep lich as is,  I feel in tests you will discover that it is not as overpowering as you may think.  Also do something with the 2 lev 60 lich line spells, no need for 2 at that level.  Consider taking one out of lev 60 and giving a small increase to lich around level 54-56 or so.  Maybe have the skeleton effect on the mid 50 lev spell and spectre on the lev 60 for example.<P>DOTs and corpse poofing:  I havent seen this is a while, but no harm in keeping it here to make sure is if fully fixed.<P>Mana transfer:  The whole mana battery concept for the necro class seems like a bad idea in the first place.  If you fix the lifetap issue just leave these spells alone.  Since we will be able to use our lich line more, the bad ratios of these spells seem justified.  <P>Infusion and essence emeralds in general:  I like the idea, I dislike the implementation.  Keep sacrifice and essence emerald requirement as is for the res spell we get.  Change the requirements for Infusion and Trucidation, or replace these spells with something else.  I don't know of ANYONE that ever uses these as is.  So do some rethinking on these please.<P>Defoilation:  Lots of things - the lower level spell never went live.  By the time you get this at level 52 things in your immediate surrounding that are affected by this spell is GREEN.  Things where you MAY want to use this spell are not tagged as plants - POG, Seb, etc.   But you should really ask why a NECRO has a DD spell against plants in the first place!  Was it because we don't have many DD spells?  Making plants in POG flagged as plants helps, fungus in seb helps, etc.  There are a couple to add to your list that seems to be empty (even though this has been mentioned before).  This spell is useless and some may even question what its purpose was really intended for.  (Turn in spell to get something better?)  Make this work in POG or take the spell out and maybe put chill bones here instead?!?  (Mentioned earlier, 52 is still good place for Sol B)<P>Track corpse:  No comment here, if its broke by all means fix it.<P>Epic weapon:  Everyone hates the graphic, lots hate the click effect.  Personally I hate the graphic (not very scary, dripping blood, shining blade, etc. would be better accepted).  At the level that one will get this item, the right click effect seems trivial.  If you want us to group more, maybe do something on the effect that benefits a party.  With the graphic change and a group positive right click effect I think more people would be interested in this quest.  We already have a right click summon corpse item, so make the click effect something else.  Get a little more creative here.  I thought it would be conjure corpse before the epic was discovered, and you guys put that on the bonecaster robe.  <P>-------<P>Thats my feedback from your inital list.  Here are some other ideas:<P>DMF/Group DMF:  Make a group DMF at 55 or keep it single target and make a minor improvement, if you pull chill bones down in level.  Maybe small improved DMF spell for the post 50s.  <P>Group FD:  Not to sure, but at least its different and is something unique.<P>Necro taking control of pet:  saw that message somewhere in this huge thread.  While I love the idea, I don't think the time will be spent to implement.  But it is a creative idea and we need more of those!<P>Pets immune to fear:  Let mages have it, cast on their pets only, make the 60 necro pet ALWAYS immune to fear.  That would make him useful as most use the 56 pet today.<P>Expand research again:   Why is research only limited to 49 and below?  Expand some post 50 spells to quests where items are NO DROP and you need research to complete.  Do something as I feel I spent a lot of skill points into something that is never used anymore.  At least then, newer necros have a reason to build research like us early necros did.  As it is today people dont use this skill anymore and just have a high level research the spell for them.  This is something that could be done for all research classes, but since it has not been done up to now, I am not holding my breath.  If lots of dev time would be required, may not be worth the effort, but you already have a strong base of dev already done here.<P>Screaming Terror upgrade:  Saw this mentioned, I wouldnt mine seeing this added, there are plenty of useless kunark spells to pull out if need be for an upgrade of this sort.<P>Night time only spells:  I like the idea, just not the implementation, some spells today shouldnt have this - Veil of Xarn is one.  Who is going to even mem this?  Harmshield will always work and Veil should have been an upgrade.  Levant is another..   I like both spells and their level placement seems fair but the night time restriction causes them to not be used.  Outdoor spells I think was the intention, but indoors is where I spend my time.  Take out the time restriction.  Or put a current game time clock on my screen next to the lag meter.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> memmed spells are precious - I personally cant afford to have either one of them memmed. Was that intent?  What I see today are 2 useless spells.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P><BR>Thats it from me ATM.

</FONT><HR>I don't think what Ogre said would be too fair. I play a Necromancer, I've never once played a mage, but I would be very upset if Necromancer pets were as powerful as Magician pets, since that is the only thing that they are very good at. Everyone should be good at something, and as far as I know, Magicians have the best pets, and it should stay that way. I have no problem with Magicians having an Anti-Fear spell for their pets, like I said, that is all they really have going for them. I do, however, firmly believe that Necros should have SOMETHING to bring to a group! Magicians have GREAT pets to add, plus very good Direct Damage spells, Damage shields, sharable Health to Mana spells, and whatnot. Necros have nothing to bring. DoTs arent useful in group enviroments, and our pets arent that great, often too much of a hastle. Please give us something desirable by groups.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Aside from some of the other commonly mentioned ideas like lifetaps and group DMF, heres a couple more I thought about.<P>-Return the Necros ability to buff pet speed with low delay weapons. <P>-With todays advancements in game engine and code, see about returning Screaming Terror to its original state(being a fear & memory wipe combo).<P>-I think a targetable Feign Death would not be overpowerful. It could save clerics and enchanters. A broken mez and a heal can be some nasty taunt factors. Make it have an icon on the target, and by clicking the icon off they would stand up.<BR>-------------------------------------------------<P>I was going to list some spells Id be willing to give up inorder to get an upgrade, but then I thought "Why should this come down to a barter system?". Why should we have to sacrafice spells and effects just to get an upgrade? I dont see too many other classes playing "Lets Make a Deal" with their spells to get upgrades. <P>As for the whole soling thing. Lets drop it. This horse is so dead a cleric cant rez it. Oh God! Necros can solo! Nerf nerf nerf! No no no. Just look around you sometime. Go to Timorous Deep and watch the Wizards and Druids take *4*..not 1, not 2, not even just 3, but 4 mobs in a single kite session. Aside from root parking and fearing, I dont think Id ever attempt 4 mobs at once. Its too unreliable and risky for the Necro. So before you start ringing that bell again about solo ability, lets stop and look at the incredible solo ability of other a few other classes.

Make it as Efficient as Shock of poisen is or was in lower lvls sheesh. Or Even Increase damage on Torbas Acid Blast which is identical pretty much to lvl 39 lifetap.

</FONT><HR>Absor,<BR>Thank you for starting this thread.  I have been reading the necro threads since one of the first uber-mob threads.  I could tell that you were a bit defensive on the first Necro talk threads but by reading this new Necro talk, I can see that you are genuinely trying to listen to our reasonable (not greedy) needs.  I will make my list brief and to the point, as if a vote, with a optional explaination in parenthises. Then at the end, some attempts at creative ideas for Raid/Uber boss spells.  <BR> There is only one thing that I ask.  Pay no attention to the posts here who scream out "Uber-foul"!  There are some very intelligent posters here and have more fairness and fun in mind then greed.  Thank you.<BR>(This is my opinion as a PC with a necro Primary, and doesn't represent the Necro community as a whole.)<P>Group vs. Solo:<BR>I would rather group better then solo better.  <BR>(We are good at soloing but so are others.  I, however, have much more fun being needed in a group. I loved some of the ideas from Dadok-RodcetNife had. ( boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/056290-4.html posted 02-08-2001 07:16 PM           ) Some of our lower targetable spells would be great to upgrade.  We have gotten so good at these spells, we can now cast on others.  Get rid of all those usless hand trick spells.  Give us something useful for others.  Please consider this for the Necro's class in all.  Not just uber raids.  Being needed means more people met, and more enjoyable playtime.)<P>Ignite/chill bones: <BR>Please change re-sizeing effect.  <BR>(would rather be effective then have an unwanted "cool" graphic.)<P>Lifetaps:<BR>Spell in Neccesary for our effectiveness.<BR>(Please consider giving us a set of bases.  Poison, fire, cold, magic, Disease lifetaps.  Everything dies.  All these elements/effects kill.  Being the Masters of Death, we should know different ways to kill.   Some work better then others, but not any increase in dmg.  Just a shot at working, even partially.  These are not high damage spells and very mana inefficient. With different mobs and different resistances, we have to mem the better spell.  Could mean trouble!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/eek.gif">! Balance shouldn't be effected.  Just a suggestion.)<P>DOTs and Corpse poofing:<BR>We know you are working on this.  Thank you.  <BR>(A message of the day would be appropriate when we know it is fixed so all will know to test if it is fixed.)<P>Mana Transfer:<BR>A better transfer rate would be appreciated, but only if that is to be our final most powerful (lvl 60) role in EQ raids.<BR>(I will always share my mana freely.  But not being able to do anything else saddens me.  I am confident that will be looked into and seen as not an appropriate role for the masters of the undead.)<P>Essence Emeralds (EE):<BR>Please re-think. <BR>(I will never misuse the EE for anything other than rez. Please see Blast of the Banshee for another idea for EE.)<P>Exp Res:<BR>Barely acceptable.  Justified, but tough to swallow.<BR>(I think the EE could be used for a better purpose.  Please read below.  I read in an earlier post [sorry.  Couldn’t find it] that had some very good ideas for necro res.  How about if it costs us a ton of mana and we get the res effect too?  We are suppose to sell our souls for power, so we loose half our hp too.  This idea where we trade a non exp res’able death for a 93% is unfair to other players.  I think there are much better uses for EE.)<P>Attempts at Creativity J:<P>Blast of the Banshee(Damned)-(lvl 55+)<BR>DD<BR>Different versions of spells.  (Cold or disease are most appropriate if we must have just one)<BR>Cost:	half the necros  mana maybe?<BR>300+ health of necro<BR>one Essence Emerald.<BR>Dmg: 	up to you.  Make it worth the sacrifice from the necro and the person the EE was made from.<P>Effect:	 In the same style as the fireball, this instead shoots a blast of a toutured soul’s essence to a Boss (castable only in certain boss zones).  Powered from the sacrifice from a fellow Hero, the Kamakazie effect is a one shot and leaves the necro stumbling from its effects. <BR>Note: 	I was thinking of this and saw a post that was similar to this so I just combined.  I can see ppl actually considering this just to help out, or even neros themselves!<P>Death’s Shadowy Protector:<BR>Pet for Dungeon spell (Indoors only)<BR>Cost: 	Now this could be fun.  PC would need an object found in dungeon (non stackable). And of course a couple bones.  Would have to crawl a bit to find the item needed.<BR>	650 mana<BR>Effect:	Now, I am not a programmer.  But have a pet that takes up the same space as the necro, like his shadow.  This is just a diving point for other much more creative Necros here.  Something that can be controlled and won’t just run off. <P>A final note on what I think of when I think of necromancers.  I think of someone who creates unspeakable undead horrors to help bring about their dark purpose.  When cornered, they use the souls they have gathered or show their power they use against the spirit world to control or strike fear in their earthly enemies.<BR>Since we, as necromancers, can’t take over a plot of land in a dark forest and slowly kill all plantlife near us for miles as we trade our soul for godly powers, we join guilds and use their lives (EE) and sell parts of our souls to perform great deeds.<BR>Necromancer fits me and always will.  Please don’t make me play another class.<P>Just my 1cp.  Sorry.  did this at work and didn't have much time.'<P>-Saintgrim<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>LOL...I posted a statement on this topic 2 threads ago and probably 12 pages ago that is still getting attention...<P>I LOVE IT!!!!<P>Why are so many upset about my posts?...Because I showed that a necromancer is not useless in the upper levels and is accepted in groups and is needed on raids... AS IS....<P>The problem I see with most necros is they spend so much time soloing they never develop deep enough friendships with other players or even their own guilds to be asked on pick up raids etc.<P>Someone even told me that the world doesnt revolve around me...Well guess what?...it sure does.  My world revolves around me and you know why?...Because I built my world that way.  I grouped with people "growing up".  I went on every guild event I could.  And now I am as much wanted and needed as anybody on guild raids.<P>Before you waste your breathe on flaming me...(it being a waste since I actually love to debate and no remark you make to powerbait even scratches my skin)...follow the thread backwards to my very first post.  I forget what part it was under.  You will see that I agree with some "balancing" issues already addressed.  I never said the necro class wouldn't be helped by a few improvements.  What I said was we dont NEED these improvements to function as a helpful and needful class on any large raid.  If you cant figure out how to make such a versatile class needed and useful, maybe you ought to look at what you were doing while leveling.  Dont cry to me just because I have found my necro to be wanted and needed.  There are ways to do it.  Problem with too many people today is they want everything spoon fed right into their mouths.  <P>My favorite posts are those calling me a necro hater, class envy loser, and troll...keep em coming you are wasting your fingers on me.

</FONT><HR>Thanks Grave Robber, I forgot about how insanely easy it is for 50+ wizards to kite.  One of their favorite hangouts is in Burning Woods where I have seen wizzies pull the entire giant fort and getting 5 or 6 at a time.  One wizard laughed at how he was able to earn half an orange bub of exp on a single mass kiting if 3 or 4 of them were ancients...<P>I'd like to see Verant back up whatever actions they take on us Necromancers with hard data like:<P>Level 51-60 necro vs red, yellow, and blue mobs:<BR>  success (killed, not killed) was xx%,<BR>  pet effectiveness (dmg over time) was xx,<BR>  spell success (stuck, resisted) for each line of spells was xx%,<BR>  If fear was resisted or ran out, pet was killed in xxx seconds,<BR>  average time to kill was xx minutes,<BR>  downtime recovery was xx minutes.<P>Now compare that data against Magicians and their pets, Wizards and Enchanters spells against the exact same mobs.<P>The two defining characteristics of necromancers are our lifetaps and our pets.  Both need to be effective for our class to be effictive.  If our lifetaps are not hitting with roughly the same chance of success as any other caster's primary spell line, the question is why?  If our pets are not equal to or nearly to the same spell level mage pet, then again the question is why?  We do have dots and we do have darkness, but those are adjuncts to our primary focus, kill with pet and lifetap.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I would rather have lich the same way it is and everything stay the same,  than be able to cast lifetap on ubers and other upgrades.  If you change lich it will hurt low level players a lot,  and your proposed enhancements will not compensate the lower levels for that nerf.

</FONT><HR> Well, I wouldnt say its easy to quad kite. I imagine someone who has done it often has enough skill and knows when to bail and when to nuke, it might be somewhat easy for them. It does take skill, and I wont rob the Wizards and Druids and sometimes Bards who can do this. I wouldnt dare ask Verant to nerf this ability and take it away from them either. Its wrong to ask for the nerfing of another class simply because you cant do what they can. It burns me up to see people ask this to happen to Necros, and I would never ask it be done to another class.<P>I never considered the Necromancer to be overpowered at any level, pre nerf or post nerf. I considered them to be what all classes should have been from the start. The Necro only seemed so powerful because everyone else was so weak. Perhaps it wasnt the Necro who was the overpowered god class, but perhaps the other classes were starved for improvements. <P>It took Verant a while to figure this out and they have made adjustments to other classes to increase their potential and usefullness. But the Necro class survived a rain of nerfs to get to this point and I believe we are severely lagging behind compared to other classes. <P>The nerfs we recieved over the course of the games current life work "ok" for 1-50 level play, but they carry on into 50+ play and do more damage than good. Perhaps just reverting the Beta Necro into 50+ play is what is called for. Strong buffable pets, Unresistable Lifetaps, and Screaming Terror that isnt a watered down mez. Mix in a few resistance buffs for pets, make them invuln to fear and Viola! Fixed Necro. No need to invent fancy new spells, no need for disciplines that allow us to do what we should normally be able to do anyway, its all right there tucked away on a series of memory cubes labeled Beta/Release Necromancer.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Trying to categorize what we do by area rather than level may be useful in helping to sort through all this.  So...<P>A.  The myth of soloing.<P>Necromancers can solo well, in some areas.  So can druids, magicians, shaman, and enchanters - often better than the necromancer.  The necromancer pays for this ability by having a great many spells self-only where other casters can share their magic, and poor faction in most of the world.<P>Yes, we're good at it, and we don't need to be better (or even the best).  But we're already paying the price for that ability.  There's no reason that the ability to solo should justify an inability to group.<P>B.  The necromancer is a pet class.<P>I think everyone agrees on this, and the necromancer spellbook clearly shows it.  The main complaint is that in the last few levels, the abilities of the pet fall far below par.  Many ideas have been brought up to deal with this issue, and have pointed out the specific problems.<P>The magician pets should be the best, certainly.  The necromancer pets should still be useful.<P>C.  Necromancers are primarily combat spellcasters.<P>The biggest advantage of the necromantic spell line-up is the ability to stack several damage-over-time spells simultaneously and not die from the resulting high taunt.  We have the escape spells (Feign Death, Harmshield, Shadow Step, etc.), the prevention spells (Fear, Shieldskin, etc.), and the healing spells (Lifetaps) so we can survive while that damage is dealt since it takes so long.  Our other spells, many of which are self-only, simply round us out as spellcasters - a few buffs, a few debuffs, a few utilities.  After pets, our spellbook revolves around damage over time.<P>The problems with DoTs have been clearly stated.  The fact that DoTs are often unnecessary/unwanted is the necromancer's greatest barrier to being welcome in a group, since that is one of our greatest strengths.<P>D.  Necromancers are powerful against the undead.<P>Or at least someone may have intended that at some point.  It would make sense, and we'd like that.  We have the largest selection of undead-only spells, but they're typically of little value to a group.  For example:<P>Hungry Earth, undead-only root and damage, at 16... long after most other casters get Root, which works just as well.<P>Ward Undead line, undead-only direct damage... useful when the first two spells are received, but the remaining spells are eclipsed by even our own weak direct damage spells.<P>The underlying problem here is that while undead-only spells are fine, there's no reason to use them instead of a standard spell line.  (Unless you're solo, of course.)  So much for damage, how about control?<P>Dominate Undead line, undead-only charm... powerful when used properly, without a doubt.  Of course, enchanters can do it better, and bards can step in as well.<P>Numb the Dead line, undead-only Lull... well, we know the problems with Lull.  Harmony and Mesmerize do the trick here, not us.<P>Spook the Dead line, undead-only Fear... it's cheap, but anyone's Fear works just as well, and enchanters do it better with their own line.<P>If the undead were immune to standard mind-control spells (not an unprecedented notion), we would have a large selection of group-friendly abilities to choose from in places where the undead are common - exactly where one might traditionally expect to find a necromancer.  We would be wanted in groups in those areas because, thanks to spells we already have, we could make a significant difference in the course of a battle.<P>Yes... it would be a major change in the world.  It would be a very unhappy nerf to enchanters.  It would strengthen the roles of clerics and paladins too in those areas.  Would it be balancing?  Ask the development team...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I just wanted to mention this:<P>Ok, Mage pets have inborn resistances. Fire pets are immune to fire, water pets immune to poison...etc. At level 59(on test so far), Mages get a spell that makes their pets immune to fear. <P>How about a reversal for Necros. Make all Necro pets have an inborn immunity to fear, and at a certian level Necros get a spell that greatly increases the pets other resistances. <P>Plus, I think 59 is too high to introduce this type of spell for Mages and Necros alike. It should be given at 53 when we first start seeing Mages getting stronger pets, and the Necros pet changes from Warrior to Rogue. This way everyone on within a raid level range can partake of these spells and their benefits.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor thanks for the thread, if it was a little belated.<P>As a necromancer one of the things I hate the most is when I hear others uhh and ahh over my solo ability, then when next I see them in a dungeon and ask if I can join the group (non-friends and guildmates) its no thanks were doing fine.  Never fails a few minutes later someone else comes in shouts LFG and then these same folks invite them to join leaving the necro sitting their shouting LFG still.  <P>Verant built a grouping game.  Verant continues to expand and improve the game to further promote grouping.  So why is that when it comes to the necro class much of what we got in the expansions only seems to promote soloing and steer many away from grouping (prime example our epic reward)?  Druids are great soloers but their buffs arent all self-only (I thought druids tended to shy away from societies and spend much time alone?).  When necro spells are self-only it doesnt enhance thier solo game but diminishes their grouping game.  Faster acting dots could be argued dont really enhance soloing all that much, it just takes one less fear/snare maybe - maybe!  However, long acting DOTS (over 60 seconds) diminishes group desirability. Why the double standard with necros? Druids have good solo ability but bring things to groups as well.  I havent seen druids nerfed like the necros in the past couple of years.<P>I ask you Absor is it soooo much that after 50 levels the necro could maybe get a few grp desirable spells??  Clerics are wanted to heal, shamans to malo/sow/other buffs, mages for damage shields, enchanters crowd control, wizards for evacs/nukes, etc. What is a necro GREATLY desired for after lvl 50?  Summon corpse but they dont have to be a part of the hunting grp for that and now just bring a SK? We should be desired for our damage dealing abilities in a grp and our self survive skills not to just dump our mana to a better deserving member!  If we lose the ability to damage mobs and have really no desired grp buffs or debuffs then we lose desireability in other players eyes result our current role on raids.  This same phenonmenon has happened with rogues, enchanters (at early levels), and some other classes to an extent.  Post 50 I believe this is happening to the necromancer, in my own opinion.  If it was just a few mobs I would say fine but the number of mobs on which we bring no benefit to a grp or raid is growing daily!<P>I know this posts probably sounds like a whine but I grp most of the time and do raids consistently.  However when you go to dungeons where you can find pick up grps what is the class most likely to be sitting there LFG? I bet you it is the necro.  Please dont stop telling us we cant be AS useful in a group because we can solo!  Other classes can now solo (better or just as good as a necro) AND bring things to a group.  Please stop the double standard.<P>Thanks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Open your eyes necromancers...  Verant does not want a solo class.  They want classes that CAN solo, but their goal ultimately is to make it so soloers are greatly penalized in the face of groups.<P>That said, forget your dreams about the necro being the "loner".  It's not going to happen because it is not in the Vision.  That said, let us see what we can do to help necros to group.  EQ is a grouping game, and though solo is totally viable, it is never going to be a part of EQ as grouping is.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I appreciate the opportunity you are giving the player base to voice their concerns and the way you are apparently acting on them (at least on Test).<P>First of all, I would like to say that I was a bit dismayed by the tone at which this post was open.  I am refering to the "if you want enhancements, you will have to endure another nerf" tone.  That set the tone for a majority of posters here that have endured nerf after nerf of the necromancer class since EQ went live.  All the necros are now afraid that another nerf is incoming.. and it is a nerf on the core ability that gives us our solo power AND allows us to play our post 50 "support" role as VI likes to call it.  Lich is as good a place to begin as any I guess...<P>LICH<BR>Leave it alone.  I apologize Absor, but lich is not broken.  It is an unintended enhancement by VI that was done when you all nerfed PvP.  If this was such a balance issue, why wasn't this brought up MUCH earlier than now?  Lich obviously isn't a game breaker (like Donal's BP is).  So why not let the necro community keep what they have?  It would be nice to hear some specific instances where lich is overpowered as it now.  I can't think of any.  Can you?<BR>If you must nerf it, make Arch lich give the ratio that lich gives now (or better) and move demi lich down to maybe 55.  Necromancers should have something to look forward to in the lich line if you are going to take away what they have now.  <P>Also, please look at the efficiency of Clarity and Clarity 2 if you decide that lich needs nerfing.  Nerf it too much, and we won't use it<P><BR>SUBVERSION LINE<BR>A lowering of the ratio would be nice.  Currently, Covetious Subversion on the books is a 3:1 ratio of mana taken from the Necro versus mana given to the target.  Now if the necro has specialized in Alteration (which in theory cuts cast time, mana cost, and spell recovery time i think)  this ratio could drop very near 2:1 i would bet although not all the time because a check is made against specialization every time you cast a spell (again, I think).  Again, it is up to you all to determine the balance thing.  Personally I dont have any problems with the subversion line the way it is.<P>LIFE DRAINS<BR>I will not comment too much about this other than to say If VI's vision is that every class can contribute something to any encounter, then necros need a way to get the life back that the lich line takes away.  We need to lich to be efficient manastones which means we need to heal ourselves to keep liching, to keep being manastones...etc.  Arguably we could get a C2 from an enchy, but still not as efficient as the lich line is now.  I for one don't like sitting on the sidelines watching my friends damage the uber killer mob, my pet run by me (feared) and me with nothing to do.<P>PETS<BR>Emissary of Thule.  From a logical point of view... why would an Emissary of the God of Fear be afraid of anything?  Make Emissary Immune to fear.  Additionally, in the current form, Emissary costs too much for what it is.  The pet is not that much more powerful than the 56 pet (offensively anyway).  That pet doesn't seem worth a peridot to me (i'd use the dot on manaskin, heh).  Now if you kicked the pet's strength up some, or gave the Emissary immunity to fear, that would make it worth the peridot IMHO.<P><BR>EPIC WEAPON<BR>Necro epic=Mighty Duckhead of the Drunken Master= GARBAGE!!<P>The difficulty of the epic quest does NOT equate with the coolness of the epic.  We get a duckhead staff with stat buffs that arent as good as most of the other epics and a 9 second casting, 1100 damage cascading darkness (not even our "best" darkness spell)  Please change the graphic to something more fearsome.. and make the effect something useful.  Since the epic is called "The Scythe of the Shadowed Soul", I would suggest that it cast an 1100 point life drain DD with no essence emerald required or a Bond of Death like DoT.. that would be nice.  I would have put forth the right-click summon corpse idea to match the right-click rez stick, but we have a robe that can do that.<P>QUIVERING VEIL/LEVANT<BR>Make them cast all the time or take them out of the game.. they are useless in their current form.  I would settle for you just fixing Veil.  It is supposed to be an upgrade to Harmshield.. so why is it only half as effective (since you can only cast it half of the day)?<P>ESSENCE EMERALD SPELLS<BR>Convergence = very useful spell and component is very much in line with the role playing factor of the necro.  Nice job here.<P>Infusion = if i am ever in a situation when I NEED an infusion of 1000 mana, i am probably close to death anyway.  Why would i cast this spell ever?  Get 1000 mana, still a chance of dying, if dead.. we wasted an essence emerald that we could have used to perform the second best rez in the game.  If this spell was targetable.. that would be something.<P>Trucidation:  Burn an essence emerald for 1100 life and a 15 minute recast time or drop Touch of Night that doesnt cost an essence emerald, instant refresh, and only gives me 400 less life?  Hmmm  <P>I don't think it would be too unbalancing if most of these spells just cost a fine piece of jewelry.. maybe a peridot, or planes stones, like jacinths, diamonds, or black sapphires.<P>All in all I am generally pleased with the Necromancer class as it is. It is my favorite class.  I have endured all the "balancing" of the necromancers almost since day 1 and I still love to play him.  Thanks for your time.<P>Shaithis Deathwalker<BR>55th Season NecroGnomicon of Tunare  <BR> <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

If so why is it not any more affective than Invoke?  Why does it cost twice the mana to cast as invoke but seems to be the same in every way.<P>Chill Bones:  This spell is super rare....why?  I only know of 2 people on our entire server who own this spell.  That is a server of over 2000 people.  Yes I am 56 so I have asked pretty much all the high level Necros about it and some didn't even know this spell existed while other stated they have never seen this spell drop or for sale.<P>Lich series:  Don't change this...you are going to mess with something that most of us have been using and is a HUGE part of the way we play.  If Lich cannot be used without a regrowth to go from 0 mana to full even if you are full health...it will take too much health please don't nerf this.<P>Really I don'have many more complaints about the class.  I am pretty happy with it.

</FONT><HR>That's quite a dilemma we necromancers have to face. Reading though these post, I see most of the people are wanting this and that but don't want any "nerfs". Nothing's free, and playing a necromancer, you should know that by now. Got to give a little (more like a lot) to gain a little.<P>On one hand, we have our over powered lich serious. We've been using the spell in this state for years and fixing this would have a huge impact on the necromancer community. Giving this up would greatly cripple a necromancer's abilities.<BR>On the other hand, we have our hidden power. Locked away because we were blinded by the power of the lich. By fixing lich, we're promised more improvements.<BR>So, basicaly, we can keep the over powered lich, or we can give it up for whatever's in the box... (the box! the box!). So what are some of the "improvements" we're going to get if we fix the lich bug? If it would return our lifetaps serious to it's unresistable state (within the 6 level limit), I say fix the damn bug already.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>Many people made some good suggestions on new improvements and I'd like to comment on them and also give some of my ideas.<BR>Lifetaps: Return it to the unresistable within level limit state. This includes lifetap DOTs as well.<BR>Chill/Ignite bones: I liked the skeleton effect. It's one of those "wow" effect and it's the little thing like this that makes the game more enjoyable. The only problem is that it makes targeting a nightmare.<BR>Lich lines: Fix the bug... Also, why do we get 2 of the spell at level 60? How about moving one of them to demi lich to level 55. Keep arch lich at level 60 but increase the ratio. With the bug fixed it won't be over powered... just makes us die faster.<BR>Group Dead man floating: Not really a fan of this idea.<BR>Group/targetable Feign death: Too overpowered. Rest of the group can die for all I care.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"><BR>Taking control of pet: Has potential.. but too much work and then they probably have to do the same with the magician.<BR>Screaming terror upgrade: Would be nice. Nicer if you can make it do what it was meant to do, fear and mez.<BR>Night time only spells: Not a big fan. Some spells like veil of xarn should have the night time only removed.<BR>Convergence: How bout making it 100% exp return?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> A life for a life. Yea people could take advantage of it, like sacraficing a level 46 to completely rez and level 60. But the component would limit its use.<BR>Infusion: Too costly for what little it gives. How about instead of just the caster getting 1000 mana, the whole group also gets 1000 mana. Still limited use but it will be used a lot more.<BR>Trucidation: Again, too costly. How about making this a point blank area effect lifetap. I was wondering why we never got a lifetap AE, this could be it. Damage would still be 1100. Won't be over powered because of component.<BR>Area effect fear: How come we never got this? We should be feared... even while holding the duck stick.<BR>Subversion line: Bad ratio. I was thinking, coral empathy is something like 300hp + 200mana to transfer 300hp, why not have the subversion be similar like, 300mana + 200Hp to transfer 300mana?<BR>Vampiric embrace: This was a nice spell. At my level (53) it does a 63 damage lifetap per proc. I'd like to see an upgrade to this spell, castable on others or not.<BR>Shadow vortex: An upgrade would be nice.<BR>Impart strength: How about an upgrade that transfer all but 1 of the caster's strength. So a necromancer with 100 strength (yea right), would transfer 99 to a tank. This leaves the caster extremely vulnerable, encumbered and immoble.<P>Epic weapon... have to add this in  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>Comparing pure caster's epics:<BR>Duck of the shadowed soul, Necro<BR>5str 10sta 5cha 20int 20hp 40mana 5fr 5cr 10mr 15dr 15pr Effect: Torment of Shadows <BR>Staff of the Four, Wiz<BR>10str 5dex 10sta 25int 100mana 5dr 5pr 10fr 10cr 10mr Effect: Barrier of Force<BR>Staff of Serpent, Ench<BR>15cha 20int 10sta 5str 40hp 60mana 10cr 10fr 10dr 10pr 10mr Effect: Speed of the Shissar<BR>Orb of mastery, Mage<BR>15str 5dex 10sta 20int 100mana 20fr 20cr 10mr Effect: Manifest Elements<BR>Note:<BR>All epic's stats(str, Sta, etc) adds to 50 except for necro's which adds to 40.<BR>All epic's Hp/Mana adds to 100 except necro which is at 60.<BR>All epic's Resistance add to 50... except for wizard, which is at 40...<BR>See where i'm going with this?<BR>Wizard Epic effect: 800 or so damage absorption shield with slight mana regeneration and no reagent. Nice, I have to go though stacks of peridot just to keep manashield up on raids.<BR>Mage Epic effect: Uber pet. Sweet.<BR>Enchanter Epic effect: Speed, Agi, AC buff... Doesn't really help the caster. Saves time and mana. About it.<BR>Necro Epic effect: Cascading darkness with added casting delay.... woot. I still use dooming darkness.<BR>I'd rather have Bond of death with added casting delay as the effect. Mana free lifetap would really help if the lich bug was fixed. Please change the look also.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR> All that I ask is please please do not nerf our solo ability. You see for me, I am a casual player. I play when I can. My chosen class the Necromancer is not a very group friendly class, but my solo abilitys are wonderful. Ive tried grouping on my vacation time and I cant STAND it. Its usually immature people or whatnot. I love that Necros can solo. Im pleading please do not nerf our solo ability. Otherwise I honestly think we are fine, except well the Call of Bones DD and the life tap on boss mobs.<P>Thank you</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
