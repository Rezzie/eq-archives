</FONT><HR>The Wurmslayer is a fine weapon as it is currently. No need to change it. How it is obtained needs to be changed however. I can easily get 6 Wurmslayers a day if I want to. It's not difficult. The placeholders for the two named wurms in BW spawn every 10 minutes. You have a fair chance, 50% or so to get the named wurm to spawn once you've killed the PH. So on average, you could get 3 named wurm scales every hour. Also, with a group gater, you can do the third scale in a matter of minutes for a full group. Lastly, if you know what Place Holders are for Sir Hobble, you can get him to spawn within 30 minutes of reaching FV also. In all, 6 Wurmslayers within 4 hours is quite easy to do. And since they aren't lore, you can do over and over again. I just traded 6 of them two night ago in Faymart and I already have 4 more on me. Sure the prices are going down, but the dopes in Faymart are easy to con. I got a Sword of Skyfire, Eboots, Clay Guardian Shield, 2 Gold Chitin Bracers, Hooded Black Cloak, and a Jade Mace in one night for 6 Wurmslayers. The thing is, I know how to do the quest fast, while there are lots of people who just don't know what to do. I can make a bomb doing it. I have to admit though, it is a really easy quest to do. I guess this is a case of where Verants Risk vs Reward went in the wrong direction, in the favor of the players!!!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Comparing armor to weapons is silly.  There are TONS, I mean TONS of weapons compared to armors.  Sure, you see everyone in crafted - what other options are there?  And yes, you DO see people complain that too much twinking of the quest armors has made banded and bronze obsolete.  So, that's eliminated 2 other breastplate pieces, oh, and maybe the BI breastplate.  But banded and bronze and even the BI are a hell of a lot easier to buy/acquire than the class armor quests, so there's no problem here anyway.  That balances them.  Do you know how many weapons are obsoleted in stats AND ease of getting AND soon enough purchase value by Wurmslayer?  Probably well over 100.  Those "newbies" and "casual gamers" you're all trying sooooo hard to protect will suffer a huge nerf in the plat value of the few previous items in their banks that they -can- get.<P>Some Gullerbacks are tougher than others.  The level 52 version that can summon does take a full group of 50's, yes (tho I was 45 in my group when I got it the first time), but he's actually kind of uncommon, a few Gullerbacks were yellow to me at 45.  Those can be taken down by a full group of 45's no problem.  And then, guess what?  It's not unusual to see Az spawn 4 or 5 times in a row between Gullerbacks at about 5-10 minutes apart.  Saw it myself a couple of times, and a friend reported the same.  PLUS, Gullerback drops a VERY nice mantle that gives higher levels motive to take him down as well.<P>Oh yeah, due to that mantle, crested spaulders are now -completely- obsolete as well, hehe.  But I'm not complaining about that, cause it made just a few items obsolete.  Wurmslayer makes TONS obsolete.<P>To those of you screaming "NO NERFS EVER", seriously, don't ever be in game design.  You said that those of us asking for this are the same ones that say "Stop whining!"  That's cause we don't go screaming and shouting when Verant puts something in the game that's a challenge - that's no big deal.  We realize that even the whiners stick it out in this game because of the challenge, even when they won't admit it.  It matters far more that the game be balanced, and sometimes, to balance the game, nerfs -are- needed.  <P>You guys say NO NERFS EVER.  Ok, let me give you a hypothetical situation.  Something is implemented in game that makes, oh, let's say Rangers  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> an uber class.  We get some sort of spell that makes us invis to mobs even as we're attacking them, let's say.  Someone figures out that if you do this camo, and then get poisoned and then cure yourself *cough cough* then the invis never wears off.  We can now pretty much down take mob bosses solo cause they can't fight back.  Would you people say NO NERF to that?  Even as everybody in the game ditches their primaries to make a ranger?<P>This is similar.  But instead of making -everyone- play the same class, it's making -everyone- under level 50 use the same weapon.<P>And I'm not saying make it uber rare, I'm saying bring it down to like 6 or 7 a day instead of 30.  Name another decent weapon in the game that drops more than 6 times a day.<P>Nerfs may not be fun in the short run, but they're necessary in the long run.<P>And those of you screaming "no nerfs!" now, ARE the ones that will be complaining about how Verant sucks and there's no weapon worth questing pre 50 and there's no variety anymore 3 months from now.  <P>Qwinn Windfletcher<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>A level 6 will NEVER have a Wurm Slayer unless it is twinked over, and if twinked than they will still have a Wurm Slayer if they wanted to get one or a yak or whatever. <P>So if the Plat value of the item is a low 1000-2000 plat, why get a 2nd or 3rd one? Why does anyone care if a group of lvl 45's or so get together and come away from a quest with a Wurm Slayer?<P>So what if the VALUE in PLAT of the item is low, it is the VALUE to the player yielding it in their group that counts, not how much it would sell for.<P>Please do not take this as a flame, I am just confused why people think that this weapon should be harder to obtain, say so AFTER they already have one? <P>I have hunted Burning Woods and have solo'd Glyton numerous times, though I prefer to group with friends as soloing is so boring. As for the A scale I have only helped kill it once and declined the scale as I can't use the item and let people in group who could use it take it.  <P>As you know to get the A wurm to spawn you have to kill a Gullerback, and if the lvl 50+ one it will summon you and is 100% magic resistant. Sure it can be killed, but not easily unless in a group of 5 or 6 and even than it is not risk free. <P>I read all the threads, and some claim this is an ultra great weapon, others say it is a good midlevel weapon, as I do not play a Melee class I don't really know where it falls. Just that it is sought after still, and I wish you all good luck in obtaining one.  <P>So many people say EVERCAMP - LONG BORING CAMPS etc.. The wurmslayer quest involves hunting/killing mobs. No camping, not boring, the way a quest should be in my opinion at least. <P>Also remember for EVERY wurmslayer in the game, it was obtained in the same exact fashion as every other wurmslayer in the game. The same quest, the same mobs. It does not matter if the person using it bought it or quested for it, the statement stands. Someone did the quest the same way that everyone else yielding one did. <P>It was still the same quest. Done the same way. The number in the game doesn't change that statement. If there are as many as I hear claimed, than a lot of people ran the quest, killed the mobs and were rewarded.

</FONT><HR>"Please do not take this as a flame, I am just confused why people think that this weapon should be harder to obtain, say so AFTER they already have one?"<P>Because, if we hadn't done it ourselves, we'd be pretty silly to say it's too easy, wouldn't it?  I mean, how would we know unless we did it?  Yeah, it's that simple.  It's not greed, it's not I want more plat for mine, like I said, I already have a better weapon (one of the few, Wurmslayer was one item out of like 10 that I traded for it, cause that person knew that they would be worthless soon too)<P>Look.  The giant fortress around which these things spawn is great experience and loot for a group that can do the quest.  There will -always- be people doing it.  There is even more motivation to kill Gullerback for the tattered mantle (which as far as I know is THE best AC shoulder piece for rangers and shamans and rogues in game).  The giant that drops the tree weave is also -right- in that area, a 25 ac breastpiece.  There's too many reasons to be there, and not enough reasons not to do the quest while you're there.  Basically, people are just going to do this quest constantly and -forever- unless -something- is done to slow it down.<P>Remember, when I say it'll be worth 1 or 2k pp soon, I mean really soon, like in 3 weeks.  I think it'll plateau there for a while.<P>If absolutely nothing is done?  Then by Christmas you'll see the value drop down to about 200-400 plat.  Cause I genuinely think that there will be more Wurmslayers on the server than there are -characters- (not even players, characters).  <P>Now think if this weapon was 200 or 400 plat.  Think on what that would do to the weapon economy.  Or do you guys just have "ALL NERFS ARE BAD" so ingrained into your heads that you don't see what a disaster that would be?<P>You think if all quests were like this it would be great?  I can appreciate that.  But that's not going to happen fast enough.  Now what happens when THIS becomes the ONLY weapon worth questing?!  And then what happens when even THIS one isn't worth anything anymore?<P>As some other people on this thread have stated, you can easily get like 10 of these by camping the area for a week.  I know quite a few people who have 3 or 4 right now, who can't sell 'em cause they're sticking it out for the 8 or 9k pp price that it was last weekend.  I tell 'em if you can get more than 4k right now, go for it, cause by next weekend it'll be down to that.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The wurmslayer definitely outclasses most weapons, anyone with any kind of mathematical ability can see that.  Oh yes, there are many 1 hand weapons that have good ratios, but the wurm has a 2 hand damage and ratio that fits in a single hand.  So you have a great 1 hand weapon?  fine, put it in the off hand, now you have the incredible damage and ratio of the wurm, and your (notice the quote) "superior" weapon at the same time.<P>I also think I should point out that "misses are more painful" is fairly ludicrous as an argument, since all weapons have the same chance of hitting at a given skill level.  "If a wurm misses it hurts a lot more"... lol that is so ludicrous its funny... hate to say it, but the LOW delay weapons will miss a lot more in a single fight, just simply because they swing more... so you are still going to do the same damage regardless of delay... that is WHY people use ratio to determine weapon efficiency.<P>Damage bonuses do factor into it, but last I checked, damage monuses were scaled on damage of the weapon, which means a higher ratio weapon is always going to be better regardless of damage bonus.  <P>So far people have listed a ton of weapons that were "better", and unless they proc 9-10 times per combat, they are dead wrong... Yaks for example are nowhere near as efficient as a Wurm... I mean come on, .625 compared to .333? for those of you who can't add, that nearly TWICE as damaging over the same interval... so unless that Yak procs a TON or the damage bonus is unbelievably high, the Wurm will always be better.<P>So do I agree to nerf it?  I don't know about that, but certainly decrease the drop rate.  I suspect it is a bug and it was intended to be a 2 hand weapon ( as a 2 hand weapon, it is fairly decent for the level range required to get it).<P>For those of you who say it is "too hard to get at 30 therefore it isn't broken", consider this:  I know several level 30-40 people who can save enough for a wurm, especially with dropping prices.  Regardless of how hard the QUEST is, it is too COMMON... that means regardless of difficulty, it won't be long before level 20-30 people start buying these in bulk, just from sheer numbers.  Why buy a runic carver, exe axe, mith 2 hander, when I can have a wurm?  and put a Yak in the off hand?  To me the only valid argument is stamina, and that makes sense.  Beyond that, there is nothing you can tell me about "game mechanics" that will justify the number of Wurms available Vs. the value of it as a weapon.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Now everyone can have one!<P>I don't really care to get one since I am a druid, I just find the request to nerf the quest SO selfish.  <P>And most of the people who are asking for the nerf already got one, and those who ask for the nerf and did not get one yet are telling in their post they will get one this weekend. LOL.  "I do not have one BUT I will have one this weekend, so I am requesting a nerf!  But I do not have one right now so you cannot say I ask for a nerf because I have one!!"  yeah, sure.  <P>Really look to me like a selish request. The only way anyone can be honest and ask for a nerf is to completely remove ALL wurmslayer from all servers and then reimplement a new quests.  <P>But of course  we all know what will happen.  All the people who had a wurmslayer will come whinning here , even the ones who asked for the nerf. <P>Whineplay.

Sounds like greed to me. 30000-4000 plat on an EASY TO OBTAIN quest? Sorry they want 8-9000. So it is easy, many have more than 1, but won't sell them till the price is back up to 8-9000PP? You implore them to sell at the 3-4000 range because by next week more will enter the game and drive the price even lower. <P>I am confused. If it is not about making cash, they would be happy to sell for 3-4000PP.<P>If it is about camping them NOW (3 or 4 in bank) than when and if quest is changed gorging those who don't have them for 15-30,000pp. On there too easy to finish quest. Is this NOT greed?<P>As you said there are better weapons in the game, and I know many will ALWAYS want the best and go after it, and those that get a wurmslayer will go after armour or bracers or other items as they always have, as well as look at those better weapons with envy and go after them as well.<P>The wurmslayer has an added benifit for the casual player. AT LONG LAST there is a weapon they can obtain, a good weapon that with a small group of friends can obtain in a reasonable time frame. Feel good about it and move on. I am referring to NON-TWINKED players who play a hour here 2 or 3 there etc.. Why do we want to NURF there fun? Take out a weapon that they can obtain as easily as a power gamer does? I hope not. It is NOT the best weapon in the game as has been mentioned in this thread. <P>So it is not the best weapon, people will ALWAYS have a preference for weapons, weather look, or rarity of them, stats etc.... <P>I guess I an posting because the thought of one more item being Nurf'd, reminds me of Kunark on opening. So many items ultra rare items now, were once plentiful. Those who got them, and than more of them complained it was too easy AFTER getting them to sell. <P>I am just disheartened to hear a player saying, please make this harder to obtain as the market will be ruined. <P>I will support 1 way to slow the number entering the game.

</FONT><HR>Qwinn I just love how you portray yourself as the lone voice of reason. Yeah *whatever*, the rest of us are just immature and don't have the depth of understanding you do.<P>You want this item to be nerfed becuase you have identified it as "uber" and have a secret craving for a sense of superiority. You hate the idea that people can buy a decent item for a reasonable price on the open market, because dammit they should have to be as cool as you to get one.<P>It's the same mentality that used to cause you to flame for pages and pages about twinking, because it 'cheapened' your sense of accomplishment. <P>Everyone, do us all a favor and quit worrying about what others have. This game is not about competing with other players to see who can get the most uber lewt (though sadly, some play it that way). It is about your ability to confront and conquer monsters. Weapons are tools to that end, not status symbols. Considering this aspect alone, the WS is not uber since its damage over time is only average.<P>And one last point, on the diversity issue. Someone (I think it was Qwinn but I'm not going to go back and re-read the whole thread to check) said they were now seeing them on half the people in the zone. You do realize that several Kunark weapons have the exact same graphic don't you? Same for lots of other weapons (heck, half the 1HB weapons in the game look like a rusty mace). Once was a time when practically everyone wielded dual Yaks. Oh yeah, those shoulda been nerfed, they were far too common. Not like they were dragon or planes drops ya know. So unless you're going around inspecting everyone you see there is no way you can know if this is true or not.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Kynara, I'm sorry but you don't fully understand the formulas that the melee system uses. The damage bonus only applies to the main hand, and is solely based on level. (the nerf 2 patches ago only applied to extremely low *delay* weapons, and has nothing to do with the damage rating of those weapons).<P>The to-hit odds are player level and skill level based, so the percentage of hits remains constant no matter the speed of the weapon. So the level based damage bonus helps fast weapons more than slow weapons. So yes, a fast weapon with a worse ratio can *easily* outdamage a slow weapon in the hands of a high level player (why in heck do you think the twig was considered so uber? it's ratio was pretty attrocious). <P>Yes a fast weapon will miss more times in a given fight, it will also hit more times. And each time it hits the level based damage bonus will be added.<P>The wurmslayer is main hand only, meaning the wielder of this weapon will get far less effect from the main hand damage bonus than he would by wielding a fast weapon in his main hand. I would be in complete agreement with the sentiment that this weapon was 'too good' if it could be equipped in the off hand slot, where the damage bonus isn't applied and all that matters is the ratio.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The wurmslayer quest is too easy.  All it takes is a bit of knowledge.  Gee, wurm #1 spawns in BW by the Skyfire zone.  Wurm #2 spawns in the ruins a tad bit north of the hive.  It's placeholder is Gullerback.  The third scale is easy to acquire as well.<P>You can put together a group and get 2 or 3 of these in a night.  Easy.  Way too easy.<P>As for those complaining about people selling them for high prices... it's called supply and demand.  People wanted it... and they were willing to pay the plat for it instead of discovering how easy the quest is... a fool and his money are soon parted.<P>But then, many things in Kunark are too easy to acquire.  These things are mainly considered so because they are weapons that are more affective than the previous "bests" before kunark was released.  We look back at the old days and then anything that is better than a yak but easier to acquire... well, we view it as too easy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Feaglund:  I have not seen nor heard of any other weapon with the same graphic as Wurmslayer.  And if there was, it would almost certainly be a 2hs, so seeing something in the offhand as well is a dead giveaway.<P>"You want this item to be nerfed becuase you have identified it as "uber" and have a secret craving for a sense of superiority. You hate the idea that people can buy a decent item for a reasonable price on the open market, because dammit they should have to be as cool as you to get one"<P>First off, we're talking about a GREAT item for what will soon be at an ABSURDLY low price if nothing is done.  I made that clear already.<P>As for the rest, that's very wise of you.  Ignore every single argument I make and instead psychoanalyze me from the other side of your computer and decide that you know my motives.<P>I have known about this quest for weeks now.  I got two of them - one I used as part of a trade and the next day I got another one to replace it.  That was 3 weeks ago.  I haven't used it much because the same day I got my first one I also got my Swarmcaller.  If I were the greedy bastard you portray me to be, I would have been farming for more.  Hell, I got invited several times to those groups trying for it because it became well known that I -knew- the details of the quest well, and said no.  Why?  Cause I don't like mindlessly repeating the same quest over and over, and because I -don't- like making a huge profit on something that I know will go down in price eventually, I'd feel like I was ripping people off.  The trade value I got for my Wurmslayer was probably about 4k at the time when I could have -easily- gotten 10k for it.  I didn't ask for more, cause I didn't think it was worth more.  So your psychoanalysis of me is so off it ain't even funny.<P>"dammit they should have to be as cool as you to get one"<P>Just ask anyone on Tunare.  DAMN NEAR EVERY TANK OVER LEVEL 35 ALREADY HAS ONE!  Tunare is flooded already, a Wurmslayer is -hardly- a sign of "uberness" right now.  Or haven't I said that ENOUGH already?  If I want to feel uber, believe me, the Swarmcaller impresses people -way- more.  My argument has to do with the worth and value of about 100 other inferior weapons in game that will obviously never be worth more than this item, and if this item floods the market to the extreme it is appearing to, then we'll get a whole TON of people whining that Verant doesn't make quests valuable enough to be worth doing, there's no diversity, blah blah blah.  And in that case, the whiners would be right, because of this ONE item.<P>Are there better items?  Yes.  But I would say that stats wise this weapon is probably around a 90 on the scale of 1 to 100.  This weapon obsoletes 90% of the weapons in game, and is going to become worth about 200 to 400 plat eventually in my opinion if nothing is done.  <P>But no, I couldn't POSSIBLY actually believe any of those arguments, I must just be some superiority driven scumbag.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif">  <P>Generally, I find that those who are superiority driven scumbags are those that throw stupid flames with no actual argument behind them.  In case you didn't catch it, by that I would be referring to you.<P>Cabale would support making it lore - I would certainly support that as well.  That would certainly help the situation.  Dunno if it'll be enough considering how many are coming in game.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Feaglund, you may be right about the damage bonuses.  But consider this.. what kind of damage bonus do you have to have to outweigh a 2 to 1 damage ratio?  Also remember that although the Yak hits more, a Yak has to hit 4 times for every 1 Wurm hit to do more damage... so although in theory a 1 hand weapon is better overall (certainly better for interrupts due to more hits, and usually better on stamina), I don't think ANY damage bonus that they put in the game is likely to overcome a ratio as high as the Wurm.<P>I personally don't have a wurm, I'm too low level with my warrior to justify it yet... but I use a Mithril staff, and I have Yaks... there is no doubt at all that the staff badly outdamages the Yaks... not my math, not by careful calculation, just simply because the Icy orc dies in less than half the time when I use the Staff... of course, that changes with the Yak Proc, but until then, the Staff is better... and I'm fairly certain that even WITH the proc, the Wurm will be far higher damage</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Guys... I mentioned this before... your "You're an ass for asking it to be nerfed after you have one" completely rules out ANY possibility that one could -ever- have a legitimate conversation with you, you realize that right?<P>If I don't have one, I don't know how easy it is to get.<P>If I do have one, then I have a clue of what I'm talking about, but you throw out that argument without listening to any -other- argument on the issue.<P>You can use the same argument if Wurmslayers cost 3 silver.  Purchasable from food vendors.  Better yet, they are a common foraged item in all zones.  They literally grow on trees in Burning Woods.  You people will STILL claim "Bah, you just don't like it cause you already have one and want to keep other people from getting it!".<P>That isn't productive.  It has -nothing- to do with the arguments being made, on -either- side of the issue. <P>It must be coming from the "ALL NERFS ARE BAD, EVEN IF YOU CAN FORAGE 300 OF THEM A DAY DON'T NERF IT CAUSE NERFS ARE BAD DID YOU HEAR ME NERFS ARE BAD YEAH I'M A VERY GOOD DRIVER NERFS ARE BAD ANYONE WHO SUGGESTS A NERF IS A SUXOR LOOSER NERFS ARE BAD KMART SUCKS NERFS SUCK" crowd.<P>No, not all nerfs are bad, people.  Sometimes, things can actually be out of whack.  Sometimes, not nerfing one item can indirectly nerf 100 other items.  And it will hurt casual gamers more than anyone else in the long run.  Powergamers will have better.  Casual gamers will be happy for a couple of weeks, sure.  Try to look at what happens to the casual player in the long run when every single player, casual or not, has one of these cause there's more of them on the server than there are characters.<P>You know what happens?<P>1)  100 items are considered "destroy it, too encumbering" loot along the lines of rusty weapons.  Just took a WHOLE lot of fun and delight at looting what is currently a good weapon out of the game.  Axe of Ironback already did it to a bunch of weapons, you can't even SELL a BIBS anymore.  I find it amazing that you people won't concede that.<P>2) A Wurmslayer becomes considered to be about what a fine steel sword is now.  No one is impressed.  It's not even decent anymore.  It is the lowest common denominator.  It may be better than most things now, but you flood a server with it and it'll become "rusty" gear soon enough, believe me.  <P>3) Verant must boost all mob strength below level 40 or so, because they want this game to be at a certain difficulty level, and those level 20 mobs are gonna be CAKE to those level 20 players wielding wurmslayers.<P>*sigh*  I give up.  The "ALL NERFS ARE BAD" crowd will simply never acknowledge that one can -ever- be necessary.  Which is why really boring games like Asheron's Call and Diablo exist.<P>Qwinn Windfletcher<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I think some people are bitter because life was harder when they were young.<P>I don't think anyone would say that the wurmslayer isn't at least a *decent* weapon from level 20 (when your damage cap mostly goes away) to at least the mid-40s and potentially beyond.<P>The thing that riles some people is that the festering hags, icy goblins, and lizardmen which were so hard to kill back when they were low level become cakewalk to the newer players who have access to these better weapons.<P>It is absolutely true that the wurmslayer has obsoleted lots of weapons, or at least driven their prices down substantially.  Is this a bad thing? You've just compressed the range at which you upgrade.  For some people 25pp is still a lot of money.  Those people are the ones who are boggling at this thread.<P>Other people think that everyone can amass a couple thousand plat, and soon every melee class will have a wurmslayer.<P>The truth is probably in between.  Between twinks and people with high level friends, many people will end up with a wurmslayer.  Is that bad? Who is to say?<P>In regards to the ease of getting the scales, it is indeed fairly trivial.  We put together a group to get wurmslayers.  We needed 4 (this was back when they still fit in the range slot).  We got all the scales (4 A's and 4 G's) in about 1 hour.  Of course, this group was also able to easily dispose of Gullerback.  So if you get a group or a couple group of dedicated farmers, 30 a day isn't that unreasonable.  Of course, farmers aren't going to be there 24/7 so I imagine the number will be a bit lower.<P>Wurmslayers becoming 300pp? I doubt it.  At some point in time, the effort to do the quest becomes more costly than the plat your receive.  How many level 55+ people do you know that farm unrest/perma/cazic/etc.  The last time really high levels farmed those places was when the level cap was 50 and they were already there and bored.  It's pretty easy to acquire a mithril staff or jade prod too for a level 55.  Just requires you to get to LOIO, invis, and whack the mob down.  Instant 1000pp or so.  But most level 55's don't bother because it's simply not worth their time.<P>At some point in time, given the group that is required to get a wurmslayer, and the fact that the X scale is kinda a hassle, and it takes some time to find Sir Hobble, I doubt any group that has the ability to do that would do it if they knew they would only get 300pp for their efforts.<P>The stein is a similar but importantly different.  A level 16 can do the stein quest.  And to a 1st time player at level 16, 100pp is still probably substantial, and the level 16 would probably be happy to farm it several times over.  A level 50 enchanter could do it just as easily (or even easier if they had a porting friend) but it's just not worth the hassle to get 100pp.  You'll probably get 100pp in coin from random mobs in Sebilis over the course of a night, and at least you are getting xp (and maybe good items too) while you are there.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Qwinn is absolutely right on this one, there is a differance between plain old RoK mudflation and wurmflation.<P>1. The 'Paladins of Norrath' devised a formula to estimate weapon damage that takes into account level bonus and strength bonus with both minimum, magic number and maximum hits. Using their formula a wurmslayer is comparable to a jade mace at 50 and vasly outdamages a yak. Not to mention the fact that it provides AC and buffs.<P>2. The wurmslayer is purchasable by players in their mid 30s.<P>3. wurmslayers are not only better for their demographic (the sub 50 player) than a yak, they are easier to get.<P>The wurmslayer is not about post 50 players, it is about the fact that people who are sub 50 aspire to use one and only one weapon. Choosing weapons is supposed to take a little bit of thought and care.

Because that's the only thing YOUR twisted little mind can comprehend as an alternative reason, then that's the only reason I can have too, right?  What the hell is CLEARLY about your conclusion?

</FONT><HR>Pure ratio can't be used to determine weapon strength, but neither can delay + level bonus.<P>Here are some numbers to help people see straight (from copeland's weapon analyzer v1.81):<P>For a level 51 warrior with 143 strength and a common haste item (FBSS), assuming a 60% hit rate (which is accurate, based on my own log parsing), wurmslayer can be expected to do 676 damage per minute in an average minute of fighting.<P>A short sword of ykesha would do 540, so wurmslayer outdamages it by 25%.  That, to anyone who understands these things, is a major upgrade.<P>Clearly there are better weapons, such as a lamentation, which could be expected to do 688 damage per minute.  Note however, that the average dmg/min for a lamentation is only 12 more than that of wurmslayer's, so for our level 51 warrior with 143 str, she could reasonably expect a wurmslayer and a lamentation to perform virtually identically.<P>Those numbers don't, however, take into account ripostes.  Since riposting does not care what weapon you are holding or how fast it is, we can reasonably expect to do twice as much damage (or more) by riposting with wurmslayer than with lamentation.  However, ripostes don't happen often enough to really make an appreciable difference in overall numbers.<P>Now let's increase our warrior's level to 60 and give her 200 strength and a cloak of flames and see how the numbers work out:<P>Wurmslayer:  907<P>Lamenation:  975<P>Lamentation has increased its lead to 7%, but a level 60 warrior ought to have even better weapons, such as a blade of the black dragon eye, which clocks in at a whopping 1167 dmg/min.<P>But what about the level 35 warrior with wurmslayer?  What kind of super advantage is he getting?  Let's say a level 35 warrior with wurmslayer, 130 strength, and no haste item:<P>Wurmslayer:  448<P>Ykesha:  281 (proc not included, since yaks don't proc at 35)<P>Now HERE'S who gets the real benefit of wurmslayer.  When I was level 35 I didn't even have ykeshas due to them still being uber items way back then, but I'd say they are far more common today.  But upgrading to wurmslayer at level 35 from a ykesha yields nearly 60% more damage.<P>Damage over time is really the only way to fairly compare weapons.  It seems pretty clear to me that from 50-60 a lamentation really isn't that big of an improvement from a wurmslayer, and if, by chance, you happen to have one of each, you'd be best served by equipping wurmslayer in the primary hand and lamentation in the offhand.<P>However, lower level (specifically pre-level bonus) people really benefit from wurmslayer's terrific ratio.  Draw your own conclusions as to why people want it for their lower level guildmates/twinks/friends.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
