Whats sad is they believe there game TRULY is this great :/<P>But ya day one was nice because it was new, every one thought EQ would be differnt, we thought they learned from UOs mistakes. Now EQ is just like UO, they have NO customer service, there GM are complete idiots, and whats funny is all this class talk is ONLY because the new games will be here soon, nice to see EQ be FORCED to kiss some ass, after all there "Its our game and OUR vision we will do it OUR way bull **** talk".<P>Cya in Hell EQ.

</FONT><HR>Well, I think all the online game companies do their best to provide service and cooperation only when they need to in order to snag customers, and once the game, as you say, "makes it", they know the players are addicted and they know they can get away with hiring online service reps that dont have a good customer service attitude.  While Verant is right in some ways, such as not making the game TOO easy for us, they should never totally put their vision above ours.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Heh heh I remember Beta and the First night of Release. The biggest thing was seeing a decaying skeleton pop in GFay with a scythe or a scimitar. You were cool then because you didnt have a weapon that looked like the chrome strip off the side of a car door. heh heh<P>Patchwork was a big deal, and people showing up with a mino axe in each hand and chainmail were gods. Everyone would gather around them and oooh and ahhh. People fell to their deaths constantly in Kelethin, and there was a sound bug in the game where you could hear spells really loud, so youd be out in the dark forest(actually only 50 feet from the guards), and hear the sound of a summoning spell, and it gave the forest a really eerie feeling. The growls of orcs sent people running back to the guards, and orc centurians were the uber mobs. heh heh<P>Kill Stealing was unavoidable upon release as there were hundereds of Wood Elves and High Elves running through the newbie areas of GFay. So everyone was always running around from mob to mob trying to gain that little bit of exp. Mino axes sold for 10pp in Qeynos and Halas and people learned to make a fortune off them by carrying backpacks full to the far corners of Norrath. And since hardly anyone had TP spells then, actually walking from GFay to Qeynos or Halas was a big deal. <P>Heh heh During beta, test server would sometimes have 5 people on it total. Sometimes being the only Dark Elf in Nektulos had its advantages.<P>It was alot of fun. The feeling of immersion and newness was overwhelming and quite euphoric. But alas, the dewdz came to town and prices shot up on items and camping and uber guilds slowly came into play. And now you basically get what you have today.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Beta=Fun<P>I enjoyed the Beta, But I had alot of problems with the game, and the beta made me wait intill Kunark came around before I bought the game. I waited for Kunark hopeing that gave them alot of time to fix old problems. And I admit all but one problem was fixed, the worst problem of them all with AMD processors. Caused me to die 65+ times. Death by being tossed up almost to space at random ANYWHERE, and then rapidly falling to the ground for 10,000 damage. Thats why I didn't rush out and buy the game after the beta, and thats why I waited, but it was still broken, and EQ Tech support could do nothing for me :-(<P>But it was cool when I had levitate on, because i would slowly float down from the top of the zone. I was so high up that I could see ALL of any zone just by looking down.<P>-Erana Dragonfire</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ahh, yeah. Memories of beta. Going to the bank to get my whole 4pp out to buy a mino axe and dropping it on the floor where it disappeared (due to a bug now fixed) and wanting to screech with frustration because that was all my lil level 5 warrior had to her name. <P>People not wearing patchwork were GODS. <P>The lift guards at Kelethin would literally never move to help you even if you fell screaming at their feet to 10 cents. We used to joke that Crush had them on his payroll. Yet, the programmers couldn't figure out how to get the guards on the platforms to stay there, so they'd keep hopping off and roaming GFay, KSing everything. Captain Leafstalker was univerally hated. He's Lieutenant Leafstalker now, guess they demoted him for all the KSing. <P>Human-type chars didn't get a newbie candle. Plus, night time was MUCH darker for a human type than it is now. I remember wandering through the teleporter into Toxx forest at night with my level 1 wizzy, couldn't even see to kill a firebeetle for a light source. It was like my monitor was just off. Had to cast my level 1 fire spell on myself repeatedly to find my way back to the zone into Erudin. I swore off Erudites forever as a result. <P>Got burned out in beta, didn't come back to EQ till a year after commercial release. Yes, it's very different.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Heh, the good ole beta days -<P>- I made what seemed like a very good living selling patchwork for 2-3g a piece<P>- I bought a Runed Totem Staff for 60pp and was thrilled<P>- I got a Gossamer Robe and thought I had "arrived"<P>- There was a tremendous, pervasive feeling of camaraderie in the game.  If you asked a question, or asked for help, darn near everyone would jump to assist.  People grouped with whoever happened to be around.

</FONT><HR>Hah, I remember Aradune's speeches (or rather, apologies) in Chat in the entire first week of release. Most communication I've had with ANYONE related to the game ever since. Kinda sad. <P>The great Mino Axe trades were considered the best way in the entire game to make money, and the theory behind "Buying in LFay and selling in the Western half of Antonica" was a well-kept quasi-secret. I never bought one, as I played a High Elf wizard, but I witnessed a large amount of them be traded. Then there's one of my interesting memories: Someone was selling Dervish rings for 3pp each in GFay, at the bank. The line stretched out the bank, around the tree, and down the ramp. I was certain that ANY +stat items would help my High Elf Wizzie. Guess I was KINDA wrong. <P>I think the Screaming Mace was one of the most-camped items on the server. You'd see them going for insane (to a newbie) prices in GFaydark. Interestingly, just about no one hunted in  Butcherblock, except in the immediate newbie area.  I made a whole "ton" of money there, selling off the precious Skunk Glands and Spider Silks (which were then used for NOTHING). First learned about the effect Charisma had on selling prices there, due to SkunkSpray. <P>I even managed to somehow get an interesting bug happen to me: I dinged to level 7. I went adventuring in Steamfont, died to a Kobold, and went down a level. When I returned to my bind point, I was STILL level 7, and had a full exp bar. One kill, and level 8. A level I never had to go through.<P>Oh, and of course, in EXTREMELY early release, nothing in the game gave you faction hits for killing them. Well, actually they DID, but they didn't report it. You just killed something, and it died. No faction lists. /loc also used to give you 3 coordinates, but instead of the Y, X, and Z axes, they gave you X, Y and Heading, which basically made Sense Heading 100% pointless, once you learned the numbers. <P>My favorite thing as a newbie were the events held by guilds considered high level (at least they were then... they could afford to GIVE AWAY 50 platinum!!) There were a couple of events held by Clan Banzai on my server (The Rathe), and I managed to finally get a prize: a Thaumaturgist Robe. Ugly, and gave only +agi, but no one could afford to give away an FBR. I wore that robe for months.<P>Speaking of FBRs, I haven't seen many, if any, worn recently. I see an absurd number of Green Silk Drapes, SMRs, Robe of Enshroudments, Robe of the Elements, and Ishva Robe (I'm a proud Ishva owner, too!) and even more newbie robes worn than FBRs. I guess it went out of style at one of the points I quit playing the game for a month or so. <P>So yes, early release was quite interesting. Wizards were universally hated because they could KS anything (no Group Aggregate Damage), no one EVER got a teleport, Bind Affinity sellers (no one did it for free) were mobbed with people within seconds, and you wouldn't BELIEVE the amount of corpses under Kelethin.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Oh yeah, I love to think back to the old days of beta.<BR>Comraderie was a big issue: I was playing on Rallos Zek and there just was no brainless newbie slaughter. Everyone was busy exploring. I remember how I saw someone with a patchwork skullcap (barbarian version) and jeez..I was so impressed. At level 6 I went to BlackBurrow and fell through the hole in the tree and lost everything (including my prize possession: a worn great staff). Decided to delete the shaman and make a barbarian warrior.<BR>Got her to level 9 and decided that I was good enough to go to different places - VERY different places. It took me about 6 hours to go from Halas to Freeport because there were no maps (except from the cloth map that came with the beta CD). Arrived at Freeport, not knowing that something like 'bind affinity' existed, killed an asp and died to the poison. Made a character in FP, consented (which included looting corpses back then) just to find out that humans can't wear large armor =)<BR>Last day of the beta, the HUGE battle where everyone slaughtered everyone else :-) God, I miss those days....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

All of us dead. heh heh As a young ranger I was actually wanted for tracking mobs in Lesser Fay. Back then the orcs in there were referred to as golden orcs because of the armor they wore. They looked like Deathfist orcs instead of Crushbone orcs.

I remember at higher levels seeing lv 40s in bronze with only a few pieces of their class specific armor, not too long after that the farming started that is when the game went down hill.  I still feel, even today, that the class specific armors (ie Armor of Ro, Crafted, Lambent ect) should have been no drop items, and i feel that the kunark class specific armor (ie Cobalt, Deepwater, ect) should be no drop just like planes armor.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There are 2 things that were wonderful back then.  The most important thing was ignorance.  No one knew anything about EQ.  I started on the day Innoruuk opened, as a 2nd wave server late in March of 1999.  I don't think we got many beta players on innoruuk, since they jumped on the early servers that month.  That meant that 99.9 percent of all of us were complete newbies in every sense of the word.<P>I started in Feydark as a wizard and was killed almost immediately by a big bee.  <P>-- I was level 4 before someone told me that I could go get a robe from my guildmaster for free.<P>-- I was so impressed with fishing.  I spent hours fishing because it was so relaxing.<P>-- The sounds of Faydark scared me.  Orcs terrified me.<P>-- I remember being chased down a dark path by an Orc and my heart was pounding as hard as if I was really being chased down a dark alley.<P>-- I remember thinking how cute Pixies were, and how there was a rumor that killing them would result in not being able to get good spells someday.  So I never killed them and would even leave groups that did.<P>-- I remeber making the trip from Felwithe to Kelthian.<P>-- I remember Orc hill, and how depressed I was that someone I knew made level 9 while I was still struggling with 6.<P>-- I remember the Sister's Nybright, and how they had the best loot around.<P>-- I remember zoning into Steamfont at 9 in mortal fear and standing there until a rat came up and killed me.<P>-- First time I saw a drake I thought it was the coolest thing ever.<P>-- I remember how the gossimer white robe from befallen was the best robe there was, and when I bought mine with all the money I had saved in 17 levels I was the happiest guy on the earth.<P>-- I remember Kalsiferous (head gm) showed up in high pass and presented me with my last name.  (another thing they don't do anymore).<P>-- I remember how no one knew what was below highhold, and that people who went down there didn't come back.  I remember going down there with the highest levels on the server at the time (20-22) and we all died.<P>-- I remember when kithicore was a boring, quiet place, before it become the deathtrap it is today.<P>-- I remember running everywhere, when no one had teleports.  It was a real adventure.  Personally I think teleports change the game way too much.<P>-- I remember when we got a bronze breastplate off a picklaw raider and it was the bets peice of armor anyone had ever seen.<P>-- I remember when Mayong Mistmoore actually existed.<P>-- I remember when no one had ever seen a dragon, because no one could get past the fire/ice giants to take a screenshot.<P>-- I remember when our guild put aside money for the "guildhouse" we were going to buy, because varent said there would be housing someday.<P>-- I remember when we thought stats mattered.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

But they never should have moved the Necro guild from the Library to the Mines of Malfunction.

"/ooc Hello? Anyone out there?" doing a /who all and seeing 50 people on but nowhere near you.<P>AE rain spells would hit all the targets in the area of effect and could be cast thru walls. There were MANY MANY wizards who got to 50 using this in Guk. Before it got fixed.<P>When there was no limits on the level of mob that you could hit with a spell. Hiding out in the tunnel to Befallen slowy nuking away at the HG at the entrance to the tunnel. Wondering how long it would take a level 16 wizard to kill it.<P>Yes there was a lot of fun in the beta. Until half way thru phase 3 and all of phase 4.

They make me wonder if they had some additional zones which didn't make it to release, or if the rumors were just of what are now familiar zones but badly distorted.<P>I remember talking to one guy who said he had apparently zoned into Lake Rathe, fell down a huge cliff and was unable to get his corpse.  Since at the time I had never been there it all seemed fantastic to me.  Was there ever a time in beta 3 when Lake Rathe had no water so that he could have fallen into the hole?<P>I heard another rumor of two players -- a cleric and a melee type.  They were fighting really tough monsters.  The melee would die and the cleric would rez him and he would continue fighting the same monster.  I guess that needed changing.  Then again, I don't know how distorted those rumors are.<P>The first few weeks after release were a nightmare.  It was almost impossible to get on because the Internet connections were so messed up.  That was when I decided I would avoid UUNET in my own dealings whenever I could.  Verant gave everyone a free month to compensate.<P>My big ambition in those early days was to get a mino axe and I was thunderstruck when I managed to get a fine steel 2 handed sword.  Later, when I got the Bone Bladed Claymore (piece of junk by today's standards) I was in heaven.<P>It all started to turn sour when I started to realize that above level 20 or so my paladin would be able to do less and less.  I played less and less until Kunark came out and found renewed interest when I started my Iksar monk.  I'm still playing although this time around I am determined to have fun and not worry so much about leveling.<P>A couple months ago my guild had a party in level 3 of Befallen.  Boy that took me back.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I was able to play starting Day 1 (actually played in beta also).<P>My favorite memory was seeing crowds of players crowded around the pool in Felwithe fishing. Literally 30+ players. For hours on end. All trying to make some money to buy their spells and a backpack~!<P>I was one of the first tailors if not the first tailor on Fennin Ro and I remember traveling from Gfay to outside Kaladim to sell my patchwork (getting competition in GFay). My gawd, the dwarves went nuts because they had not seen it yet since there were no wolves in BB. I remember selling pieces for 8-10pp a pop .. which was a fortune back then~! Then I spent my fortune on my first magic item ... the much covetted Cutthroat Dervish Ring~!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057031-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057031-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057031-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057031&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057031&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
