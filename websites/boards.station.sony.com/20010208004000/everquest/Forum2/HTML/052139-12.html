</FONT><HR>Hmm. Just read your official replys to this tread on castersrealm. The thing that Enchanters have to suffer from the religion they chose even though they can turn into the shape of that race and they for that reason chose agnostic now.<BR>When i was a young chanter (thats aprox 19 months ago) no one told me that its wise to skip that god question. Learned the hard way that quellious might stand for expore and learning, but is not welcome to explore evil citys and learn there. <BR>Didnt mind that much till i wanted to start my EPIC quest. Beeing a erudite and growing up in qeynos i turned in every bandit sash i found for exp and faction. Would you believe that i have to ask a girl in the qeynos sewers for some vial to start the EPIC quest ? Tried it several times, the reply is "i dont trust you" WHACK SMASH LOADING PLS WAIT... NO illusion would help.This girl has Bloodsabre faction. I messed mine long ago with the sashes, but i dont even try to get my faction up, for i got a good god... I doubt that she would EVER talk to me... Multiquesting time...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Now, I honestly as a 53 Enchanter have only used Illusion:Troll in a real situation, I really don't care about Illusions, just don't take away the ones we have  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Now there is one huge thing I have a problem with:<P>Post 50, we get 1 mes, that lasts a generous 30 seconds for 275 mana. There is no ther way to mes a 53+ mob, everyone I have attemted to mes (with the exceptions of ilis in Seb) says that they cannot be mesmerised with this spell (Dazzle, level 49). This makes prefect sense, but we never get a new long duration mes, making us very unreliable in crowd control situations where we cannot do anything to more than 1 mob for a few rounds.<P>And all this about Illusions, it's ridiculous, honestly, let them fix a real problem. I don't care if I can turn into a Female, or change my face, I do care that I get killed all the time  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well I didn't have time to read all the posts but I do agree that tashan line needs to cause less argo.<P>One idea I do have for our class as a possible spell would be an area effect confuse. Instead of causing the mobs to be charmed or mez it could cause each mob to become hostile to everything around it and would make for some interesting possiblities maybe.<P>Another thing is more illusions. I still don't see why enchanters can't turn to a spectre or a Bear. Granted other classes want something speical but what about enchanters. One of our most special things we could do was charm a mob and create a cool scene of monster vs monter but now Magicians can create the same scene (although not as helpful).<P>A mana dump for enchanters would be nice and helpful (I'm often FOM)<P>Longer duration buffs for more mana cost would be nice too<P>We mostly need something to do when we can't mez and there are shamans around and we can't dd.<P>What about a short duration stackable haste. Something like 5-10% that lasts for 1-2 minutes would be cool to have. <P>I am convinced by the high resist rate of higher level mobs and the fact that our later Mez spells are worse than our earlier ones makes me think Verant doesn't want enchanters to mez. If we can't mez a spell that lowers average damage output would be good (not speed cause shamans already have this) if we could like lower attack rating (added effect for cripple maybe) then we could be more effective.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There's one bug I noticed with illusions. When illusioned, your illusioned race is displayed correctly on the local who list (For example, if I'm in Dark Elf form, the who list will report me as Dark Elf), however, the global who list reports  your actual race (such as Human) regardless of illusion. Honestly, this kinda ruins a lot the fun  of illusions, even if many people don't know about it. <P>Of the posts I've read, Mezzmo and Axterix have the really good ideas and thoughts, and I liked a lot of the points they mentioned. I'll try not to repeat the points which a lot of people have already discussed (high level mez, more illusions, ect).<P>One thing I would like to see be improved is more recipies for all trade skills using the thicken mana line of spells. I think the idea behind these spells, being able to channel my mana into a physical form, is really cool. However, there are virtually no uses for these vials of mana. The 'EQ economy' doesn't need anymore Wu's fighting gauntlets. Something that would be really cool is a sort of "Enchanted Temper" for forging that requires a vial from one of the higher level mana spells. I know people already complain enchanters have a close monopoly on magical trade supplies (metals, ores, ect), but Druids and Wizards also have a monopoly on taxi service, Rangers on tracking, Shamans on alchemy, and so on. One important thing to remember when designing Roleplaying Games is that every role should have things about it that are unique. One last thing about the thicken mana and enchant metal spells: Don't change the purchasing source a bit. Figuring out how to get them is part of the fun, a sort of "Test of enchanter skills" to prove yourself worthy. <P>I'm only level 22, so I can't comment on a lot of gameplay issues, but there is one thing I'm rather upset with. The level 16 AoE Mez, Mesmerization is utterly useless. It resists really easily, even with blue mobs. Whenever it resists, the taunt is huge, ensuring a speedy death if it's more than one resist. Also, the spell really shouldn't mez the caster!! It's just disheartening when you're upstaged by a druid's harmony at level 20, which seems to work a lot better. <P>PLEASE please please please give some sort of indication that a monster is mezzed. Changing their name tag color or making it blink would work really well for this. Honestly, it's bad enough trying explain to clueless group members 12 times over that if you want something to stay mezzed, a) don't attack it, and b) don't DOT it (glares at necros). When pulled monsters all run together in a ball and look exactly the same, it's rather difficult to try to point out to your group members which one you have mezzed. <P>Although I understand this is unlikely to happen, it would be nice if the mez spells had a slightly faster casting time. This is for defensive reasons, as the first thing an enchanter will usually do when he/she gets jumped is to mez the thing. The problem is the casting time is slow enough that the mob can usually get two or three hits in before the spell finishes casting, meaning you get interrupted a lot. On anything higher than a middle or low blue, it usually takes two or three attempts before the spell casts correctly, losing a good chunk of HP in the process. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Okay you said something that I am gonna call you on-<P>Enchanters with crowd control can turn the tide of battle basically acting as ten players.<P><BR>And this is a bad thing because??<P>Clerics can make one warrior act like ten with complete heals.<P>Bards can make a group swing faster and change the outcome of the battle.<P>The Hps of the Tank can make him/her worth twenty enchanters.<P>The DMG of a wizard/rogue/monk makes him/her worth 40 enchanters.<P>A Mage pet can change the battle more then four enchanters.<P>A Necro Pet along with the Dots can make one necro as strong as tree warriors and a rogue.<P>A Druid can take down kite a Sand Giant at 24 while enchanters still have trouble with SGs up to level 44.<P><BR>So tell me again how powerful we are, how we can weild our might? Someone over at Verant didnt play an enchanter, just heard that everyone wants on in their group thus they must be overpowered.<P>How is it unbalancing for me as an enchanter to hold my own in a battle and change the outcome, I thought thats what an enchanter does. They can stop mobs in their tracks, alot of the focus of the enchanter is the master of the mind, HECHT, the plane of growth wisps ( enchanters ) talk about phantasmists and how they crawl into your mind. <P>Thats what we do, we change the battle, we make it easier, as do other classes, but nothings a free ticket with an enchanter, you have to learn, and know how long a stun will last and how long a mez will last and what to do when you get beat on.<P>Apparently somewhere along the lines of making the game and designing the game, the vision got blurred, and the enchanters just became a lumping ground for old spells of other classes and give them the ability to shapeshift, although, now every class and their sister can do that.<P>Look at your game, look at what an enchanter sees, our spells are mind icons, we are the masters of changing the battle, coming in freezing enemies in their tracks, often making them stare into space. We are the masters of illusion able to convince anyone to deal with us. Yet you want to change this.<P>Look once again at what you created in EQ, the game itself, the guild masters of the Enchanters, the Master Enchanters, they all shapeshift. Look;<P>Mizzle( Epic Quest Master of Clarity )-Clockwork Gnome <P>Jeb ( Epic Quest Master )-Sarnak <P>Modani ( Epic Quest Master )-Scorpion<P>Guild Trainer in Freeport-Aviak<P><BR>Look at the masters and the shapes they can become, that is an illusionist, someone who can change their form to anything, thats a master.<P>A beguiler, someone who can make you obey them, and want to obey them and serve them, and sometimes just lose control of themselves and obey.<P>A phantasmist, one so skilled they crawl into skull and destroy your mind from within, making you tear at your very skull. I may be a weak skinny elf, but I can crawl into your head and make you sorry you were ever born.<P>Tanks might have brute strength, but the enchanter, the enchanter rules the mind, makes you more able to control you magic, makes you slower, makes things cloudy, makes you like them, makes you follow them. <P>Our strength isnt in the dmg we can command, we arent Wizards with the ability to bring enough fire to level a small mountain, we arent mages who can summon items from the very air and make the elements obey their whim.<P>We arent Necromancers, the masters of the undead, and all that is related to dark art...<P>We are enchanters, illusionists, beguilers, and phatasamists, masters of the mind, the magic, we can and will change the battle.<P>We might not make you as strong as a shaman, or as healthy as cleric, our mission isnt a holy one like shadowknights and palidins, and we arent trackers or woodsmen, not masters of the outdoors, and not scouts and masters of the shadows....<P>We are the enchanters, and we will change your mind, by magic, or charm.......<P><BR>Go back to the vision, see where and why the enchanters were hacked with stupid spells, why our soulbind spell ( the ability to bind any class anywhere ) was removed and replaced with a rather silly spell. Why our illusions suddenly stopped, did the creativity run out at Verant? Lycantropy was an idea and when it wouldnt fly the form was given to enchanters, a give me spell, along with spirit wolf, skeleton, and drybone. These spells were just left overs from other classes, it shows no originality, no spark of creativity, and just makes us the chopped up remains of other classes, and not a class unto ourselves, hecht we didnt even have clarity there for awhile and when that became too unique you gave a form of it to every casting class except the clerics.<P>Your idea of an enchanter is disapointing to say the least, the one described on the box and the in the advertisments doesnt even match the cut and paste job you did to our class, and now you think we are overpowered? No, we arent, we just learned to how to use what we were given better then other class out there, but its time, time for Verant to say, lets make them a legimate class and not the "Fun" class of the game. <P>Enchanters are played by the most intelligent people who play your game, of course we can act as ten people, its who we are, we defined enchanters because all you did was slap us together out of used parts.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OK, addding my two cents.<P>Dyns should be better than Whirl. Should not be broken so easily. At least make it as good as a root of the same level for holding power. Let the stunn portion break, but not the root portion if that is feasible.<P>If a mob can't be charmed, the spell should simply not cast. Same as when a dismiss summoned or undead spell is un-castable against mobs it won't effect.<P>Nukes should not ubber taunt when they are resisted. You didn't hurt the guy, he should be laughing at you. I know I do when I resist a mob's nuke.<P>Lull series should work more like single mob harmony with no agro component. Make it long recast time (2 minutes or something) and it does not become overpowering. Put a level limit on it based on the spell level like charms are.<P>We have the minor illusion, how about a major illusion. The major illusion will work kinda like monster summoning for mages, except it turns you into a random mob illusion in the zone. If you can clone nearby inanimate objects at low levels, why not a animated object at higher levels. This keeps you from having to make sure the form is in every zone, and allows chanter a cool, fun spell. Even if the only bonus is a small faction adjust, it would be neat.<P>Spirit Wolf. Give it the same travelling speed bonus as Jboots. Takes a few of the campers of the Jboots circuit. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>About Gift of brilliance. Sure its a nice spell, but its disturbing to see that it costs so much for so little gain. The other already mentioned spells (aegolism, Protector of the glade, focus, just to name a few) are buff spells that are long lasting and cover a couple of things. An extension of my mana pool by 150 and an extra regen of 2 mana seems a out of whack when compared to the other spells. Your inital idea was a good direction, id just consider the lowering of the mana cost and keep the current time, or increase its time to 2.5 hours.<P>(You may have commeneted on this but unlike you, I dont get paid to read 10000 pages of this thread =P)<P>Thanks for your time.<P>BTW please dont nerf us, i have this scary feeling that instead of being "enchanced" we are gonna get the "shaft". thats just me being paraniod, enchanters havent seen much lately to make us real happy so, i suppose thats where im coming from.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Why would anyone want an enc in SoV?  Since (apparently) we are religated to doing buffs (Haste and Clarity, we don't have much else... Ok CHA too), seems to me I'd want a bard... There songs can clarity, speed, regen hp, increase AC, stamina, movement increase, etc.  They also have better AC, HP, defense, dodge, and can actually contribute to melee too. In SoV a bard does everything just plain better.<P>People want enc's because of the 5-6 mob pulls, otherwise snare and root would be adaquate for a 2 mob pull.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There's only one thing I want:<P>A practical targeting system for when the MOBs are all in the exact same spot. Sometimes, especially in small rooms, AE mez just isn't an option (same with "mez, group backs off, repeat" technique), and it's very frustrating not to be able to mez efficiently just because I can't _target_ the damned things.

It's not like a melee type loses the ability to hit mobs over 53.  By reducing the number of mobs we can affect and the ways we can affect them, you reduce our roll in the game.  Verant seems to be ok with that.  Enchanters as a whole - are not.  <P>It's a pattern of the non-obvious nerfs that really bother me.  At one time, it seemed that very few mobs could see through invisibility.  It was a great spell for lower levels.  However, as time wore on in the game , more and more mobs can now see through inivisibilty to where it's almost useless.  While it was not a publicized nerf - it's one that reduces the value of the spells we started out with.  That's just a simple example.  To relate it to enchanters directly - look at charm, mez.  Great spells - but over time, they become almost worthless in many situations when you get higher in levels. And in conjunction, it's not like Verant ever went back and revisited NPC's and said - oh, lets make these mobs now mezzable or charm-able.  It's ALWAYS been the opposite;  Lets take away instead.  Correct me if I'm wrong.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Oh, and another thing. About the "more illusions" request, I think the copycat illusion would make everyone happy. And there's a very simple way to make sure enchanters can't use it to go places no one should be able to: Make it so it doesn't alter faction in any way! Most enchanters only want this spell for the fun factor, especially since we didn't get any new illusions with Kunark and Velious as we hoped we would.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor I just have to wonder what you personally have against enchanters? If there is something enchanters may want that another class has you say the classes should not be blurred anymore than they already are and they should have "special" things for them. However when it comes to giving out abilities that have been traditionally enchanters you back it 100%. I am honestly scared to death that you are the representative for us to the powers that be inside VI. You have already stated you think we "may" be overpowered and not to be surprised if nerfs come of this balancing of the classes. Again I ask why are you so biased against enchanters?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Thanks for taking the time to read this, after all reading this shear number of messages has got to be hard.<P>I'm a level 56 enchanter on Veeshan and here are my comments.<P>1st. Something has GOT to be done about the magic resist rates of mobs in Velious and future zones. 99% of the enchanters out there decided to play an enchanter because of mesmerize and crowd control. To TAKE it away this late in the stage of the game is just not reasonable. Also the magic resist rate is so high that NON of my spells get through on alot of mobs in velious. In icewell keep there was not a single spell i could cast on those mobs at level 55. NOTHING. I'm sorry but if you are going to reduce my class to casting clarity 1 time every 20 minutes and casting haste 1 time every 20 minutes and then doing NOTHING for 20 minutes then I'm going to quit, period.<P>2nd. Is mesmerize overpowered? Yes in relation to not having it it is. Just like having HEALING power is overpowered to not having it. The problem is only ONE class in the entire game can mesmerize, it's the only skill that was NOT shared with any other class. Yes yes bards, ahhahahahaha as if their mesmerize means ANYTHING.<BR>Mesmerize does NOT need to be removed from the game, it needs to be given to at least ONE other class in a weak form (like bard, but not a USELESS form, just weaker). Then design all encounters with MESMERIZE in mind. I mean you ASSUME people will have HEALERS right? Well if you give at least one other class the mesmerize ability then you can assume it also.<P>3rd. It's just BAD BAD practice to remove 90% of a classes abilities this late in the game. That's what you've done in velious. Enchanters lost the following:<BR>Slow<BR>Cripple debuff line of spells<BR>Str debuff line of spells<BR>Charm (except level 60 charm)<BR>Mesmerize<P>We lost ALL of those abilities because you made monsters too magic resistant. No offense but I AM NOT going to play a class they decide 2 YEARS after release should ONLY buff every 20 minutes and then sit aroudn for 20 minutes till their turn to buff again. The fact that you are ELIMINATING the prime abilities of classes 2 years after release makes me not want to buy any future Verant games. Why? Because who wants to invest 2 years into a character only to wake up and effectively have him deleted one day?<P><BR>I don't care about illusions, I don't care about anything but being able to be a ACTIVE group member like I am in kunark and pre kunark. I WILL NOT play this game where I buff and then watch pseudo TV for 20 minutes, and many many other enchanters will not either.<P><BR>IMO you don't need to nerf mesmerize like you did. There is NOTHING wrong with it. It's extremely powerful, but so is healing. Just GIVE SOME OTHER CLASS mesmerize and then design encounters with it taken as a given like you do healing. Mesmerize IMO is the ONLY thing in EQ that takes any form of skill, removing it removes 90% of the single group combat strategy and tactics.<P>Also if you just can't live with mesmerize as it is then for god sakes give us enchanters the option of converting to another class of equal level minus all our equipment. It's just not reasonable to expect us to have our MAIN abilities REMOVED 2 years after release.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Let enchanters get the spell Brilliance at an earlier level.  By 44 everyone has 200 int already making this spell end up only giving about 15 mana (depending on level) which is really useless.  Can't help but notice that at level 1 enchanters have a +10 str spell... hmmm... i know at lvl 1 i didnt have 200 int yet =).  Im not suggesting to make brilliance a lvl 1 spell but from a wizards point of view i would love to have an enchanter cast that on me back when i was 20 or so.  In theory Brilliance is a wonderful spell but by the time they get it its pretty dumb and in general a waste of mana.<P>Give chanters brilliance earlier!<P>Shadex Neophyre,<BR>52 wiz Ayonae Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This is a little bit of a vague issue, which can be influenced by many things, of course, but here is what I am finding :<BR>I am a Dark Elf Enchanter.<BR>Being a _Role Playing Game_ , I decided to follow Innoruuk.  EVERY enchanter I talked to told me to start over, start over.. be agnostic.<BR>WHY?  I want to role play.. but now that I am progressing in level, I am finding it harder.. almost impossible at times, to group.  At this level, I can solo MABEY two blue mobs.. usually only one, without having to sit and heal up and med for 10-15 minutes, as I summon a new pet, rebuf it, and myself, then wait for both my hp and my mana to regen.<BR>I TRY to group, but I can sit around, with /lfg on<BR>or using /ooc  to let others know of my class, and level, and that I am looking for a group.. I will get a ton of tells to come breeze their group (often NOT full groups) but NO offers to join..<P>I fiiiinally found a group, but I had to travel to highkeep to do it.. and I died twice, I believe, by someone training guards.  Even with my illusion on, whilst I fight, and some npc's are still aggy, and even alliance/soothe, etc.  Will not stop them.<P>Now, I am getting a ton of 'dead time'.  I just sit around.. not realy doing anything, just trying to find a group, for sometimes several hours, until, fed up, I just go practice brewing, or just kill level one mobs for no experience, out of sheer boredom.  I am comming near to quitting, because I simply can not find a group.  I leave around the time things start peaking, but still, up to that point, there are usually quite a few people on the server I play on (Prexus) and I see groups that I would fit in perfectly with, and people either say 'no thanks'  or just ignore me.<P>I ask politely, and am nice in my /ooc .  I try to find dark races, so I can rp with, and when that is unsuccessfull, I turn off /roleplay and try for an hour or two more... still no luck.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><BR>I have tried both roleplay, and not, and I have no luck either way.  Enchanters are _made_ for groups, and once we hit 16, we should never be w/o one.. so I have read, and been told, but I just don't find it so.  When I can actually find a group, the game is great fun, and I gain exp, and I just have a blast.  Hell, even if I die, it does not really upset me.. I kinda laugh, and just make up the exp, since I am actually _gaining_ exp.  I have made some other charcthers, all low level, just to see what the other classes are like, and I had not one bit of trouble finding a group, pretty much at any time I played, in any zone I played in, and at any level I was at.  Oh.. hrm.. this should have went a bit further up in my post, but I am a wee bit tired, so my grammar is lacking tonight.  I have tried my /lof on | /ooc | *wait* *wait* *wait* /ooc | *wait* *move to another zone* | repeat routine in hrm.. Lavastorm, Ecommons, Wcommons, Kithcor forest, Nro, Sro, Oasis, Highpass, OverThere, Timorous Deep, Lake of Ill omen, Firiona Vie, Field of Bone, Befallen, and Swamp of no Hope (I think that's all).  Some of these zones take me a couple, or several hours to walk to, esp. when I am unable to find any assitance with ports, SoW, etc.  I just invis, and walk, hoping I don't die, then bind at each zone, so if/when I die, it's not a long walk.<P>Moral of this story.. I don't know exactly what could be done about situations like mine.  I have to make friends in-game to play with, since My friends that do play EQ are either on another server, and changing servers is unreasonable to him and/or myself, or are not available to play the same times that I am.   Things such as a Mask of Faith spell, that would change/mask religion would help a small bit, so I might try safely in the other zones to group, or something.. I am just at a loss, since I have truly tried, and I just don't know what exactly could be done at my level range.<P>I have also noticed two of my spells, specifically, wear off around 1/2 of the time within 5 seconds of my finishing casting them. (even when I stand perfectly still casting them, and stay still several seconds afterwards, and having ~153int and ~137 cha, with all my spell skill levels maxed for my current level)  These two spells are : Invisibility, and Root.  It _really_ sucks when you cast invis, everything is cool, and you start treking through a zone that you are KoS in (many times to NPC's that don't like your religion, so even having the appropiate illusion will not help), your spell wears off, right in front of a guard, and....<P>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<P><BR>Or, solo'ing a mob, and even though he is cons blue, he takes out your fully buffed blue pet, and  as you cast root with your last bit of mana (memblur will not work sometimes, as you have to be so close to cast it, and they can turn aggy on you), and..<P>Your root spell has worn off (or whatever the actual message is)<P>&lt;insert mob here&gt; hits YOU for 30 damage.<BR>&lt;insert mob here&gt; hits YOU for 28 damage.<BR>&lt;insert mob here&gt; hits YOU for 15 damage.<BR>You have been slain by a &lt;insert mob here&gt;.<P>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<P><BR>Then, of course, a painful ammount of time regaining that exp, esp. when you can't group (see above statement/paragraph/novel)<P><BR>Ok, that is all for now.. I am sorry if I did not provide a huge ammount of suggestions, but that is just what I have expreienced as a low level enchanter,and go through every day I play.<P>From the  upcomming 10BILLION page novel (or the post seems so) The trials and tribulations of a lowbie enchanter.<BR> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>Xaoalo &lt;Dark Divinity&gt;<BR>Enchanter of the 18th Tome<BR>Faithful Follower of our father, Innoruuk<P>Prexus Server<P><BR>Thanks for listening all(who stayed awake though this)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>This is my first post to this message board so I hope its getting to the right place.  I have a 44 enchanter and have several suggestions to offer regarding the enchanter class.<P>The first issue I would like to address is that of illusions.  Many enchanter postings make a big tadoo about the fact that enchanter illusions stop at 44 and want more. Although I feel more would be nice, I would much prefer the ones that we do have be fixed so that they don't wear off upon zoning.  This is a useless way for a spell to work and all it does is lead dark elves like myself into going ld in a horrible place like Kalidim and have nothing to do but eat a death because GMs won't help out with Link Dead related problems.<P>The second issue i would like to address is the enchanter DoT line.  It doesn't really bother me that we only get one line of DoT spells because it isn't the primary focus of our class. However, these spells work horribly and in my opinion not very effective for two reasons. One is that they have an initial DD which acts like all DD spells having a tendancy to break roots. Whats the point of a DoT that agros and breaks roots like a DD.  In my opinion there isn't.  Secondly the duration is much longer than the duration of other DoTs which wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the first point i mentioned.<P>Another area I think the enchanter needs work has been touched on by another post. This is not only in regards to enchanters but to debuffs in general.  The debuffs enchanters and shamans get are in fact useless on NPCs because they have to have limitless stats and mana.  Althought helpful in duels spells like mana sieve, weaken and incapacitate are useless in any other situation.  The other post suggested a % reduction rather than a numeric one.  THis suggestion seems to have merit to me.<P>The last point I would like to touch on is that of enchanters role in group situations and implications of that.  Enchanter's job in many group situations is to keep mobs in line while the warriors do their thing.  This job is very perilous and in fact I have noticed from personal experience that enchanters are the biggest agro target of most NPC mobs.  We get hit hard and often and many times become a mana sponge to healers.  All of our spells seem to megataunt and since memory blur doesn't seem to affect higher lvl mobs there isn't much we can do about it.  This being the case: 1 why do we get next to worthless armor as a class prior to planes armor, 2 why do our defense and dodge skills cap so low, and 3 why well why DOESN'T mem blur work?  Seems if nothing is gonna be done to help our ac or hp the agro rates of our spells could be lowered a bit.  Also an area of effect mezmerize spell above the 24 second lvl 16 one would be nice.<P>I don't feel that these are unreasonable suggestions and for the most part I don't think we need more spells or whatever I just think the ones we have could be more effective.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Excellent posts as far as I have read.  It's a pleasure to see so many thoughtful, relevent posts.<P>In the unlikely event that anyone reads this far, I'd have 2 points only.<P>The first is to reiterate the problem with VoG casting times and recast delay.  A 6 sec cast is ok I guess, although I'd like to see it reduced.  But 15 secs for the recast?  Come on guys.  That's a touch extreme at 21 secs per party member.  If I'm raiding with 10+ tanks it takes me 3 - 4 mins to haste them all.  Its boring and a pain.<P>The Crystal Crown of Confusion is a great item for stats but the proc is a joke.  A right clickable lvl 44 ae stun?  Fine, but make it like the spell.  At the moment it takes 15 secs to cast.  15 secs?  What do you expect us to use it for?  If we're stunning to break gates or CH's then 15 secs is WORSE than useless.  In 15 secs they have gated AND CH'ed.  So, why not make it the same cast time as the lvl 44 stun and the same delay?  Or get rid of the effect and give it serpent sight like the Tranix Crown?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It figures....<P>Ok, there are some serious balance issues that need to be looked in on PVP servers.  Mainly it's that our spells are taken from us.  This has nothing to do with how we're unable to pvp people with high MR.  It focuses on how we can not use AE stuns, mez's, or spells.  To use it is instant death, because the AE mez's hit our group members.  AE stuns don't, but they hit the group's pets, which agro them on you...nother tough thing to deal with.  I'm sure if Absor reads this post, he can see where it's going.  Bottom line, you want balance?  Look at the servers, enchanters on PVP servers can't do nearly as much as enchanters on non-PVP servers.  Fix that first, then worry about the other petty matters.  That AE mez is great when you got 8 mobs.  But nope, we gotta do it one at a time.  It's annoying, and is causin' me to work into a rant.  Check it out Absor.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>hi, its me again.....<P>i am level 8, i know i know its low level, so i really do not know anything about those level 50 spells and i dont care about them for now what i do care about is that i cant kill jacks**t.  when i try to do my job of crowd control, i cant do jacks**t. why coz i die trying, and guess what i kill all my groupmates too because my spell got resisted and all those funny looking orcs, all 5 of em, start ripping off my limbs, oh yeah after they get through with me, they go after my groupmates, GOOD GOING ENCHANTER BOY!! thats why you dont see people asking enchanters to group, they are walking death warrants!  <P>our job is to crowd control, then we should be able to do that, period no friggin questions about it. no resistances no aggros! <P>now, now, i am not suggesting that i can mez a big bad dragon at level 1, heck we dont even get mez at that level =P.  what i suggest is that <P>1) our lull and mez lines will not aggro, either they stick or they dont. look at no. 2<P>2) no resistances on our mez with level limitations. what i mean by this is that  probably a red con will never be mezzed or maybe a small percentage that it will actually work, but mezzing even level and lower levels should always work.  look you're a bad ass 16 level enchanter who has studied all those magical books on how to mez, and you cant even mez a level 10 mob, hey maybe you didnt do your assignments right when you were at enchanter school.  <P>3) if people think that no.2 is too much then give us at least the confidence that when we mez or lull, we wont pull a big train that will kill us and the whole group, i probably killed my grupmates 5 times, good thing they didnt disband and form a group without me, i think they were kind enough not to do that but if you ask me, if a person gets me killed 5 times, im leaving him out of the group or im leaving the group period.<P>why is this needed? because if verant doesnt fix our mez spells, we are USELESS! did you hear that USELESS! we just sit there and pretend we are doing something by casting str and haze...thats it! oh yeah i can dd...sure...be a wizard then. oh yeah i have an animation, sure, be a mage then or a necro. you can turn into lots of wonderful other races, yeah right, will being a half-elf or a gnome stop those charging orcs from killing me and my groupmates because mez made them all angry....<P>i hope they fix this one real soon....i love the idea of an enchanter but like what darkmask said, i think we are all just scraps. thats why i respect all of you high level enchanters. you stuck with this class even though all your frustrated hair pulling made you go bald. to all of you cheers. to us who are frustrated enough to complain this early, i hope we get our way...i read somewhere in the post that this is a thread having more than 400 posts and we arent asking for anything great to be given us, we are simply asking verant to make us into what wee shuld have been from the start.<P>thank you.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't know how changing an illusion's gender is going to give us anything we don't already have. I can see it as a spell that I would never purchase. Why can't we have an illusion like the mage monster summoning spell. Except we would take the form of the monster the same way. We already have illusion earth elemental and the other spells. Can you give us one command for the pet? (/pet guard here) would really help in dungeons so pet doesn't go wandering off and pulling the whole place down on us. As it stands I can't even use my lull line of spells or aggro debuffs because pet gets lost in dungeons. A pet healing spell would be nice. These pets are ALWAYS blue to me when summoned and die rather fast (Create a 29 enchanter and make a pet and time how long it takes a creature that cons blue to you to devour your pet.

</FONT><HR>Hello, Absor and everyone else who might read this:<P>Ive seen lots of flak thrown at Enchanters for being 'too powerful'. Perhaps its just me, but I dont see how anyone who's ever played an enchanter could think such a crock. Allow me to list:<P>1- As an enchanter, you get a pet (awesome! we'll be able to solo!) But he only attacks when you're getting beat on, and he is the weakest pet in the game (Crud).<P>2- You get fear spells (Oh boy! now we can keep the mobs off our pet with a fear spell and Reverse Kite! Now if only we had a snare spell....) Please!! Snare! I beg of you!<P>3- You get the best line of Charm spells in the game (Yes!! Who cares about our weak pets? we can just charm mobs to do our bidding!) But unless you have 160+ charisma, its not lasting you for crap duration. Oh, and one other thing, good luck finding a spot where Charm-Killing is any safer than 'Whew! as long as this charm holds..AGH!!'. <P>4- You get some awesome mana recharging spells. This I admit is a very strong point an enchanter has, however, most of the other classes (cleric and Mage excluded) get some form of mana regeneration (shaman - Canibalize, Wiz - Gather Mana line, Necro- Pact line)<P>5- Be able to debilitate monsters to the point where your weak pet can actualy stand a chance...but..oh yeah, Shamans out do you in that field at any given level.<P>6- Use illusions to get into cities you otherwise could not..This is another strong point, however, I never saw the game world premise that everyone knows what god you follow..probably the same premise that everyone knows what you've killed..but..thats not my beef. Having my illusion fall off because I went LD in Firona only to come back and have my little inky butt beaten into a bloody pulp for the 60th time is kind of annoying..Invis stays with me, why not my illusion? Also, if you're going to give us that illusion power (THANKYOU!!!) please, please please...make it last during zone change..I hate fearing for my life when i have to travel in a multi-zone city.<P>In conclusion, I hope I havent made too much of an idiot of myself, but I think ive got some points. Ive put a lot of hours into my little enchantress, and ive learned a lot about how to play her, but when people say that enchanters are too powerful...it just makes me think that they've never played one, or atleast havent had the bad luck ive had (you know you're not doing well when its hard to keep friends that are your level because everyone you remember being 3 and 4 levels below you is not 3 and 4 levels above you). My playtime for..33 levels now..(hmm..im kinda low, arent I?) is somewhere in the area of 20 days...20 days..thats 480 hours or 28,800 minutes and ive got a guildmate (GO LOST MOON! =P), an Iksar Monk actualy..who has atleast 3 or 4 levels on me ( i never can tell, the bugger always taunts me when he levels 3 times in the time i level once) and his play time is roughly 1/4th of mine. I asked him how he shot up in levels so fast and he told me very simply: Solo m'dear, Lots and lots of solo. And thats when it hit me: Enchanters are the worst solo class in all of Norrath. The only solo technique we have at our disposal is Charm-Kill..and in my expirience, its VERY hard to find a suitable location to do such a complicated and difficult manuver. And then another epiphany (did I spell that right? hmm..maybe not) Charm isnt meant for that kind of thing anyway, Enchanters ARE NOT meant to solo, we are purely group characters. Either that, or Verant has done a very poor job at making us able to solo with the rest of 'em. Now im all for groups, hey, I LOVE having a tank to keep the beasties at bay and a healer to watch my back if I screw up and bring 3 mobs down on myself, but I also found (much to my distress) that unless im in the ultra-dangerous setting of a dungeon, the expirience is below par..getting tiny fractions of blue bubbles for every 4 or so kills (fighting mountian giants in Frontier Mountains). We enchanters have mastry it a very powerful field, Crowd Control, but granted its a great thing it have, its the only thing we can do. The rest of our power lies in PvP (in a PvP setting, Enchanters win every time, I dont care what you are). I like PvP, in fact, I rather hate it..i get killed by mindless monsters enough as it is, I dont need intelligent players on my tail 24/7. Anyway, back to my request =P ( i always get sidetracked, dont I?) I know asking for an Enchanter-Only xp bonus in parties is WAY too much, im SURE Absor will shoot me down if I ask for that (right, Absory? =P) But what I AM asking for...is I way to solo that isnt tossing my life with a roll of the dice on how long my charm is going to last. I respect the fact that we are made to be group characters, and I love being in groups..I just am sick of not having something else to fall back on. 'Enchanters can ALWAYS get a group' ...Yeah..right.<P>-Laylou, Enchantress (33..FINALLY!) of Drinal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One more thing (*blush*)-<P>I just read DarkMask's post up above mine (top of the page or so..you've prolly read it already) and I cant agree with him more, with the addition of SoV (which for enchanters has basicaly been one big nerf that costs 16 bucks and a trip to the local game store). Also, many other people are saying lots of VERY valid things that I love, about how hard it is to be an Enchanter despite how some crazy people (Hmmm..Maybe those who have NEVER even played an Enchanter??) want to nerf us even more. We DID get the 'Shaft' and are continuing to get it while every other class suddenly has our abilities and our strengths, next thing you know every class will be able to Mez (Its all we have left...). I waited a while for Verant to get to this Enchanter Talk, and now that its hear all im seeing is NERF! NERF! Burn the witches! blah blah blah...Absor, you ARE biased against enchanters, and im terrified that you're the one who represents us as players, you want to know about enchanters? Play one. I think i can speak for the rest of my kin when I say that the expirience of being an enchanter isnt something you can learn by telling...its only gained with practice. Until level 24, I was convinced I was some sort of wizard..I didnt even use memory blur until 16, Mez was overlooked. I tried to be some other class...maybe thats because we ARE just a patchwork of the other classes, Dark Mask is right..and im sick of this talk. Its late, and im going to bed. I for one will cancel my account if any nerfs go down, if any you should be sympathizing with the poor enchanters who cant to a damned thing compared to the other classes. To the two young enchanters I read about (one was 8, the other in his 20s), hang in there, guys..read everything you can, and learn...and take a cue from Dark Mask, we're only powerful because we've learned to enchant the copper we've been thrown into a shining bar of platinum.<P>XXOO - May (er..Layou - 33 Enchantress of Drinal)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>okay, heres an idea.. I'm replying to the posts that say something about mez being basically taken away from us in SoV, what i mean is the mobs that cane be mezed should be replaced with something like this. Have high lvl mobs that cast dot on themselfs so they cant be mezed, and make that dot be magic based, and only recant magic can take if off.  so all of the sudden, recant is extremely usefull, and so is mez. so now, the game is a little harder and were still doing our old jobs, but they are a little more challenging.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>** NOTE ** This is an interface issue, not a balance issue.<P>Please improve my ability to target PC's and NPC's.  <P>Summary:  Allow me to use Function keys to target pets within the party and to cycle through all NPCs in the area / aggro'd on my part / etc.<P>First, all pet owners can target their own pet by hitting F1 twice.  I would like to be able to target a party members' pet by hitting F2 twice (or F3-F6 respectively.)<P>Second, when targetting NPC's, clicking on the screen is decidedly inaccurate.  For example, if my group wizzard is medding in front of me and I try to click on a monster over the wizzie's head, I generally get the wizzie targetted.  It's tedious.  So, I use F8... but on a large pull, I still might not get the correct monster.<P>Please give me a key to cycle through monsters.  If it is possible to have a /non-assist type fuction that would be even better.  Perhaps a combat awareness skill for enchanters to be aware of who a monster is attacking and who is attacking a monster.  <P>Why is the a problem?  I was in Velious last night in the Great Divide fighting Kodiaks.  There was a feral kodiak standing entirely inside a savage kodiak (same body, just a bit bigger than the feral.)  I was unable to target the feral at all!  This happened repeatedly - and I eventually came up with a solution : Clear my current target, step in, AE stun and see who hits me... that sets my target... AE stun again and mez current target.  Rinse and repeat.<P>Thank you and Absor, and may your reading be fast!<BR>TJ<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>no offense but if you cant target something then you should move to a different angle. this is what makes good enchanters FAST targetting, i never use f8 and never will, if there is someone in front of you MOVE. and of course the taunt issue. there is a reason why tash is a huge taunt -- its unresistable and in many situation malosi line of spells will never land unless you tash.  and btw, try casting tash after the tanks taunted it off... so basically if you know how to play the game the targetting and agro wont affect you -- it just takes skills.  i can see another post now saying why cant we have mind control and when we look at something it automatically gets tashed/mezed/mem blured/cast berz str on yourself/select-warrior-in-group/right-click-on shissar-staff-and-let-it-cast-the-speedbuff-then-sit-back-down... i think you get the picture</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just to keep this short and sweet (and easy to read)<BR>Problems I've seen:<BR>Enchanters underpowered at low levels. Not many damaging spells, and so forth.  This may not seem to be a problem, but they also do not have much else to contribute.  When leveling with a wizard and a warrior, both were gaining exp much faster than my enchanter.  I suppose this doesn't need to be 'fixed', but I think that it should be taken into account before 'nerfing' the class.<P>Too many spells. (Just a personal gripe)<P>Illusions droping when zoning. (Bad when slipping into Neriak 3rd gate to get enchant spells.)<P>Suggestions for improvement:<P>Make higher level charm/lull types harder to break when used on lower level creatures.<P>Faction/ Religion/ Racial masks are a good thing.  Adding a religion mask would be cool.<P>Enchanting items (yeah you know already)<BR>I would suggest making them much like other buff spells.  Maybe like damage shields (flaming sword anyone?)  Definately non stackable.  Some should be self only (force-staff).  Some should be target only (sword of fire).  Should not be castable on Monsters/NPC's.  Pet enchant item spells for charm pets expire when charm does.  Any item enchanted should be Nodrop/ Norent.  Need not target the item, just the player weilding it.  Might need to treat as proc weapons so lower level characters can't use a high level enchanted weapon. (Spell won't work on characters of too low level)<P>I think I've carried on enough about that.<P>Feadel "The Crimson Knights"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>people might say chanters are overpowered in a group situation, but at the same time they really can't solo - they have some pretty neat spells, but if they are soloing they struggle to get them off, even with their pets.  and they don't have sow or feign death to make an escape.  mez is great, but try getting it off with some mob beating you to death after it has killed your pet.  if chanter balancing means reducing chanter power in group situations, how about doing something to make them able to solo.  take away their group appeal and they may as well forget about leveling.  clerics and chanters are critical to groups - and for these classes to exist, they need to be because they can't level by soloing.    </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>One more thing (*blush*)-<P>I just read DarkMask's post up above mine (top of the page or so..you've prolly read it already) and I cant agree with him more, with the addition of SoV (which for enchanters has basicaly been one big nerf that costs 16 bucks and a trip to the local game store). Also, many other people are saying lots of VERY valid things that I love, about how hard it is to be an Enchanter despite how some crazy people (Hmmm..Maybe those who have NEVER even played an Enchanter??) want to nerf us even more. We DID get the 'Shaft' and are continuing to get it while every other class suddenly has our abilities and our strengths, next thing you know every class will be able to Mez (Its all we have left...). I waited a while for Verant to get to this Enchanter Talk, and now that its hear all im seeing is NERF! NERF! Burn the witches! blah blah blah...Absor, you ARE biased against enchanters, and im terrified that you're the one who represents us as players, you want to know about enchanters? Play one. I think i can speak for the rest of my kin when I say that the expirience of being an enchanter isnt something you can learn by telling...its only gained with practice. Until level 24, I was convinced I was some sort of wizard..I didnt even use memory blur until 16, Mez was overlooked. I tried to be some other class...maybe thats because we ARE just a patchwork of the other classes, Dark Mask is right..and im sick of this talk. Its late, and im going to bed. I for one will cancel my account if any nerfs go down, if any you should be sympathizing with the poor enchanters who cant to a damned thing compared to the other classes. To the two young enchanters I read about (one was 8, the other in his 20s), hang in there, guys..read everything you can, and learn...and take a cue from Dark Mask, we're only powerful because we've learned to enchant the copper we've been thrown into a shining bar of platinum.<P>XXOO - May (er..Layou - 33 Enchantress of Drinal)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I dont think i want any NEW illusions ... what i would like is IMPROVED illusions. The illusions so far are "nice" most of the time and have some side benefits but none really help us with our job.<P>1. elementals are fine and useful in some zones for faction / aggro reduction<BR>2. races are fine for getting the faction benefits in towns<BR>3. skelly illusions are USELESS since the effects are really non existant<BR>4. wolf illusion is neat since i am a pervert and love to confuse druids by asking them for SoW when illusioning a wolf<BR>5. werewolf is really nice since it has some great boni useable at some times (like the STR bonus)<P>Suggestions for improving the illusions:<BR>1. elementals should get some kind of resistance boni (start with +10 and increase that to 30 ??) for the respective elementals (water for cold, fire for fire, air vs poison, earth vs disease)<BR>2. since druids get more than one improvement of their wolf form i think its only fair for us to get an improved illusion which INCLUDES SOW effect<BR>3. as for usefulness of illusions i would like to have an improved illusion werewolf spell which adds regular regeneration (werewolf is designed as combat illusion so give us something to heal as well)<BR>4. since some other classes get some form of class specific mana regeneration increase why not give us the MANA ELEMENTAL ILLUSION which increases our own mana regen (and maybe give resistance to magic compared to 1. above)<P>There is really no need to burden the global texture file with NEW stuff to give us new illusions. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 16 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-11.html">11</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;12&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-13.html">13</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-14.html">14</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-15.html">15</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/052139-16.html">16</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052139&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=052139&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
