</FONT><HR>.    I see people complain about necros in uber-raids, how their spells are useless except to give their mana to others.  As a rebuttal, I see some with lists of how classes can contribute, but the lists were never finished, just "and the list goes on . . ."  Well let me tell you something, especially you necros, stop your whining, you want tough, try being a Shadow Knight.  <BR>     We have lesser versions of your spells (and you're all going on about how good THEY are . . .) and we can't even grant mana to other classes (not that we have as much as you anyway).  Even if we DID have better spells, we can't cast and swing at the same time so it's either cast and hope a spell sticks, or just hack away and hope we hit.  Add to that our total LACK of disciplines (that's right, LACK, our disciplines are jokes on raids, totally ineffectual) and the fact that, on any given average, a warrior will hit for maybe 75% of the time and SKs will be lucky if they top off just under 50%.  <BR>     In my guild raid of Venril Sathir, all the SKs were told, "that's right, TOLD" "uhh, you guys stay out here."  So we sat in the right corner and pulled mobs while everyone else had fun.  No one wants us agains VS when he can hit and drain for over 600, given our lower parry/dodge skills and NO disciplines allowing auto parry or riposte.  Talk about role reversals, WE become the green mobs in the zone we used to use to heal OURselves with lifetap.  Yeah, that's contributing . . . <BR>     What do we have to offer?  Darkness, won't stick, Life Leach resisted, HT resisted (even with discipline), pets (don't get me started), our less-than-effective-uber-mob tanking abilities, MAYBE our siphons will stick, MAYBE take 10 str, 16 ac, 10 or so attack rating, which will get the attention of the mob, get us siphoned and killed while people yell "who healed the MOB!?!" and be a mana dump for rezes. I honestly don't see, having played to level 52 as a troll SK, what we have to offer in uber-raids.  Unless we sit back, feign death, and if everyone dies I'll be there to tell them, "pssst, the coast is clear, come back in and rez everyone . . ."  THAT"S fun . . .<BR>     So please, Necros, I understand your pain, but try to see you're not the only one hurt post 50 in raids (we are still effective in hunting parties for experience, I'm not TOTALLY knocking the SK class, just our abiltity to contribute in high level raids) nor on the bottom of the barrel, (this includes other hybrids, but heck, pallys can act as lesser clerics healing and rezzing if nothing else and rangers now have an auto parry at least).  Work on the SKs a bit at least when you look into necros, we ARE kindred spirits after all . . .<P>   - Vorrek, 52 TSK, Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor: <P>Why was the Mana Transfer spells added in the FIRST PLACE?<P>They were added, if I recall correctly, along with Asystole in Verant's attempt to make up for the nerfing of the necro pets because they were considered "overpowered".  This was also an attempt to make necromancers more group friendly.<P>Yes, it was done in compensation, NOT as a result of original design.  Or if it was originally designed, it came 6 monthes late after the game waas released.  Don't tell me I played 6 monthes to see my class completely changed from its foundations into a role that I did not choose to play!<P>You claim that changing roles should be an accepted part of life, but you state enchanters as the example.  Yeah, enchanters can't mez Trakanon, but mezzing isn't the only job enchanters do.  Enchanters are a UTILITY class.  They do utility, they CHOSE to do utility, they will do utility.  You don't see enchanters whining that they can't fear kite or do massive damage, because enchanters do not care for those things.  I know you understand this concept, but you have to live it to really appreciate it.  Enchanters do not whine about doing massive damage because they never did massive damage.  They are utilities, they want to be utilities, they are PROUD to be utilities.  A necromancer is not proud to be an utility, even less a miserable one.  Different classes for different personalities, right? We are not all the same, true, but if you look at the majority of the necromancers you WILL see that we do share similarities, or else we would not have chosen this class.<P>What you did to necros is like making clerics nuke instead of healing.<P>Will clerics be pissed off at that? Yeah, I think they will.  Will enchanters be pissed if they were given heals and told not to buff/mez/charm? Yeah, I think they will.  Will warriors whine if they became casters? Yeah, I think so.  None of these seems logical or even relevant, but this is exactly what you did to the necro class.  <P>Even if you made the wizard a better tank than the warrior was, even if you made him the best tank there can be, the majority will probably NOT thank you.  If they chose to be a wizard, they did not choose to be a warrior.<P>You say that the necromancer is still good outside epic encounters, but you forget: Velious has proven this to be false.  In Kael Drakkel, Skyshrine, Siren's Grotto, Western Wastes, Necropolis, Temple of Veeshan, Veeshan's Peak, and a load of other zones necromancers go through similar, if not exactly the same, problems.  Make me a Karnor's Castle and make me a Sebilis in Velious, and necromancers will quiet down(though the problem still exists).  But when an entire expansion is meant for raids and necromancers suck at it... Yes, they will complain.  They have a right to.<P>Now addressing the whole board:<P>Consider the following statements, readers.  You may agree with me, but take them only as opinions and nothing more.  <P>I have one gripe personally about the changes that came to the necromancer's class: That I wasn't given the chance to change classes.  If Verant is going to radically change a class's role at higher levels they need to offer players an alternative.  I've stuck it through rain and snow since I started this game back when it was first released.  I've hoped that the darkest hour of necromancers will pass and the new day will bring hope and rebirth.  Yet all I see is a cascading descent into a role that I have not chosen but of which was forced onto me.  When I started to play a necromancer, I did not have mana transfer spells.  I did not have hp transfer spells.  I did not have mez.  I did not have DMF(okay I had it, but it was broken).  I did not have summon corpse.  What I did have was the necromancer, in his basest element, and I enjoyed being one, and was proud to be one, despite adversities, downfalls, or disadvantages.<P>I can't say that anymore.  I can no longer recognize the class that I am.  I can no longer name the face that stares back at me in the log in screen.  Nothing has changed about my past spells, but I have changed.  I have changed because the lands have changed, because the Vision has changed.  I am sorry, but I no longer see myself as a necromancer.  I carry the name still, and perhaps I am a reformed necromancer to all who beholds me, but to myself: I am no more.<P>And this lack of identity, this lost of cause, this fear of the great Vision that could change me at whim and will...  They are elements far stronger than any matter of balance or power.  If all who reads this post can remember nothing else, or wants to read nothing else, remember this:<P>I placed efforts, just like any other player, to become someone in this world of pixels and bits.  Somewhere along the line, the way I had chosen was barred to me, and another road picked and chosen for me and thousands of necromancers everywhere.  We have learned to adapt, we have learned to survive, and we might even prosper.  But ultimately, this road is not our own.  Or perhaps, let me say that this road is not the one the original necromancers have chosen.  The younger generations know nothing more, they have only known this road.  But we have known more, far more.  We have seen the true face of the necromancer and fell in love with what was given us as a future.  It is us who suffers now, and us who cannot abide by these blows.<P>Verant can change many things, but they can never change the hearts of those who play the necromancer.  We had become comfortable with the role the necromancer was, had become content, had embraced it... And it was destroyed.<P>Let us not speak of whether the necromancer is strong or weak, or just how much he offers to a raid.  Those things are important, but not as important as this.  For here is the heart of any roleplaying game: the role.  Change the role and you change the class.  Change the class and you belittle all the hours and work players faithfully placed into your game.  You make a mockery out of them by telling them to change classes if they were not satisfied to be a necro.  You tell them that their hours were wasted, that their efforts were in vain, that they had made a wrong decision when it is Verant who has changed the heart of the class and thus forced them to do so.<P>Yet through all this I can sympathize with Verant.  I can see why you did this.  What a necro can be allowed to solo must never surpass what a group can do, yet if good loot was placed on a monster that the necro can do with some difficulty it would be a walk in the forest for a group.  You knew that you could not make necromancers solo their entire lives - it was not feasible nor was it fair to the other classes.  So you changed the original vision to make necromancers more group friendly.  <P>But somewhere down the line, you lost the way.  Necros ended up half a soloer and half a grouper, slapped into a package and delivered out before he was truly ready.  No wonder the hostility you receive.  You have neither affirmed the necro's soloing tactics(naming the game group-based and stating soloing as only a secondary thing) nor allowed him a good position in groups.  He's a hybrid here, somewhere between solo and group play, but balanced in such a way that he did not come into his own in either one.  You did not make clear the role he was suppose to have, and so kept many of the older necros in solemn anxiety.  You did not land the final blow to make them quit or change classes, but kept them in suspension for hope that the necromancer might revert to that of old.  You made soloing harder and harder, yet kept to your notion that necromancers were masters of soloing.  You made monsters stronger and stronger, yet kept to your notion that necromancers were balanced in groups.<P>Here is where you erred.  The class you did not change as much as the lands, the vision.  With Kunark you stabbed the necro in his heart.  With Velious you twisted the dagger.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor I think you need to do a bit more homework on this.<P>"And a necromancer can return the corpses so that the cleric can work.."<P>But the necro does not even need to be part of the raid to this task.  One could simply be logged online to summon the dead corpses. <P>"You all eschew the use of pets on raids, but they work just fine against any creature that doesn't use fear."<P>Umm... Trak does not fear yet his AoE poison attack kills fully buffed Tanks in less then 30 seconds.  How long do you think Jober will last?  Alot of Epic fights involve Mobs with similar high damage AoE attacks.  Perhaps you need to look at that before you over estimate the pet.<P>"Oh, and you mentioned DoTs making corpses poof."<P>Even if this is true with the track record that VI has [sorry but it is ify at best] try and convience others of this.  It was reported to be fixed once before.<P>"But the high-level-raid-boss-monster-type-NPC corpses shouldn't poof at all due to a fix we made months ago."<P>Umm.. the Ragefire mob poof tonight upon the Tunare server and the GM was nice enough to refund the Cleric the pearl. This is the second time that this has happened.  This seems to be in direct contrast to your above statement.<P>"They shouldn't be poofing any more. Not on NPCs over 55th level"<P>Why 55th lvl?  That still leaves all the planar mobs under that level.  If this is fixed then why not truily fix it and be done with it.  If this still happens upon a Planar mob do you think other players are goign to trust the fact that it should not happen with a Dragon or God?<P>"Changing the resistance to Lifetap is probably not an option"<P>I have heard rumor that their is a special Flag to determine if a mob can be affected by Taps.  Is this true?  If so then how about removing that flag?  Something is blocking Life Taps...<P>"First off, don't you guys know how to mez? You can, you know."<P>Screaming Terror has a level limit to what it will effect.  I can not use it upon a Jugg or some Reets in Lower Seb.<P>"well, frankly, you suck"<P>Well, frankly you have no damn clue what we are talking about...  So when you learn to read and understand we are not talking about day to day grouping then come back and try again.<P>"There are no zones where summon corpse does not work."<P>Yet there are zones where I can only cast the spell in certain spots.  Nice change to the spell but that is another dead topic.<P>"and if you do ALL the damage to an NPC (you or your pet) and go LD before it dies, the corpse might poof."<P>What about if I am killed and I did DoT the mob.  Does the code cover the Necro not being in the same zone or does the mob poof if the DoT kills the mob and I am not in the zone?<P>I am glad you are taking the time to look into these things but I think you need to take a bit more time and look at the problems from the game and not from the numbers upon paper.  <P>But thanks for atleast listening and discussing with us.<P>Bril <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>And what the heck is with you necro haters ANYWAY?<P>You say:<P>"Hahaha suffer necros.  You shone for 50 levels it's now our times to shine."<P>You miss the point!<P>The power gamers, who are really the ones who boast and care about power and strength and uberness have MOVED on.  The first moment they saw the weakness in the necro class and how crappy the necros have become they've switched classes.  They became monks, rogues, warriors, clerics, enchanters, etc.  <P>You are not dealing with power gamers who care nothing more but to be the best here.  You're not dealing with necromancers who give a damn how cool they were during the first fifty levels.  You're dealing with people who has put time into their class because they believed in the class and the role the class plays.  You make it sound as if we were an affront to all you stood for since level 1.  You make it sound like we did you some great wrong because power gamers decided to boast about their uberness.<P>Guess what, I grouped from 1-50, with a solid group of friends who helped each other get items, explore dungeons, complete quests... E.g. All the things that EQ was suppose to be.  I did not HAVE to be a necro to get from 1-50.  I could've done it just as easily as a warrior or cleric.  I played a necro because I wanted to, not because of the raw, cosmic soloing uber power power gamers strived for, but because I thought "hey, the master of the dead, how fun."<P>I can tell you that nobody outside of Verant knew how the classes were going to end up eventually when they first started it.  No one knew that necros were gonna be uber soloers and nobody knew enchanters and clerics would become part of the Big Four.  As we grew, we sort of understood the bigger picture, we grew into the role we played or we switched classes.  It is that simple.  <P>So stop it with your mindless bashing of necros because you thought we did you some wrong by being better at soloing.  The power gamers who specifically chose this class for its soloing abilities are most likely gone once they noticed they could make twinks.  The necros who are left just want to have a viable, useful role over 50.  We don't care about being powerful, but we do care about having some good old necro fun.<P>And we can't even have that. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

This is all assuming a raid situation.<P>Necro vs. Cleric<BR>A cleric can rez after the fight, a necro can summonc corpses after the fight. The key word here is after. Neither rezzing nor summoning makes either class wanted on raids, only for cleanup.<P>A cleric has a transfer rate (mana to health) or something like 1:4 if the tank has 2000 damage on him. Tanks will sometimes have even more, depending on the situation. Necromancers' mana trasfers are 1:3/8 (or if you prefer, 8:3)<P>Look at that for a minute. Clerics are over four times more effecient with their "transfers" than we are. See how the comparison breaks down?<P>DoT bug I'm not sure on. Verant says it's fixed, several high level necros I know say it's not. In any case, no matter what you say, DoTs get us thrown out by the ear on raids.<P>Now for the counterpoints:<BR>Any pets can and will be yelled at by ignorant people. However, our pets are eaten by any AE, not just fear.<P>We are NOT saying we want to do massive damage. We just want to do SOMETHING as useful as the other classes.<P>Yes, we are balking because we suck in the 'big' fight. The clearing stage isn't even worth mentioning, as any raid packing enough punch to take down the big guy will be able to steamroll through any guardians that need clearing.<P>DoTs may or may not poof corpses. See above post where guy asks you to come to Timorous Deep so he can prove they poof.<P>We are not "exceptionally" powerful in "all" other parts of the game. For example, we are not exceptionally powerful anywhere challenging at the 50s. We do not suck, we just aren't the powerhouses we once were. We're in line with other classes, more or less. NOT exceptionally powerful. I feel we are a little weak in fact. But the point stands. We are NOT exceptionally powerful at all other portions. That's just inaccurate.<P>Please take the illusion off our DD. We would vastly appreciate it. I thought the skeleton thing was cool, but form over function is a bad thing.<P>I don't see why our transfers couldn't be improved a bit. even a 2:1 ratio would only allow us to dump a cleric for roughly half his total mana. Allowing us to function as half a cleric DURING the fight won't unbalance us. As for this breaking balance at other points of the game...we have good spells we'd rather cast instead of giving our own mana away, right?<P>I like supporting my group in an uber raid. I don't like being awful at it. We ARE awful for the fight portion as damage, support, or both.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Let's make some of these issues apply to other classes.<P>For melee classes- New mobs, TOTALLY resistant to ALL physical damage, and they Death Touch. The role for tanks? Run in an eat the DT, wow, a new role for tanks, a qucik meat wall to die. as the real important people, casters do damage.<P>The whine from this would set the boards on fire.<P>For wizards- mobs only able to be damaged via DoTs. Hell, due to their *****ing about resists on uber- mobs, they got lures. Let's give them a fine taste of the old days.<P>For support classes- zones where NO buffs can be cast. Then people can just dump all the un-needed classes like shaman, enchanters, and druids, and take important classes.<P>For clerics- a zone where no cleric heals will work, the area is so that the cleric is cut off from their gods, and only necros can heal. That would sure be fun.<P>See, the heart of the matter is this, no class is so totally changed like the necro class on a raid. Every class in essance does what they ALLWAYS do. With the expection of necros. <P>Also, to Alan, why is it over powering to allow taps on "uber" mobs? Make the Taps work with the same resist of lure spells. No guild will take a huge team of necros in place of any wizards and tanks. Why? The basic amazing terrible effecency of taps. The damage to mana ratio is worse for taps than any damage dealing spells. Also, no necro can hope to tap to stay alive once they agro any uber mob. Come on, name one case, even Cazic Thule, a 53rd lvl mob will ripe a 60th lvl necro to bits, when he agro's on them. There is no way in hell to tap to keep up with the damage. The same is true of the average mobs in Hate or Fwear, DEEP blue to a 60th lvl necro, the damage the caster will eat from a agro'd mob completely outstrips the hp a 60th lvl necro can hope to get from taps.<P>Also, to some of the more foolish posters, like the chanter, LordZeus, yeah, you want to get kicked FAST from a group, use ST when not asked to,since chanter mez will NEVER over write ST for some reason. <P>As for the pet issue, pets now at BEST hit 30% of the time. see you people forget something REAL important. Pets were so strong, due to the fact that they were NPCs, NO MORE! Pets are now seen as PCs, to kill the great rate of proc'ing they got from items like a SoR. So, instead of tanking well for a 60th lvl necro, they now tank like a 42nd lvl warrior.<P>Any groups take a 42nd warrior for a tank in OS, Karnor, or HS, let alone deep in SoV?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>For the new and unaware, this is the problem:<P>The following classes contribute to the big fight:<P>Warriors, Shadowknights, Monks, Rangers, Bards, Rogues, Clerics, Enchanters, Shamans.<P>Briefly here is why:<P>Warriors:  AC.  Damage.<BR>[So many disciplines--most excellent]<P>Rangers:   Damage.<BR>[Disciplines suck nothing special here sorry]<P>Monks:   Damage.<BR>[So many disciplines--most excellent]<P>Rogues:  Damage.<BR>[Backstab+Epic+Disc=omg damage]<P>Shadowknights:  Damage.<BR>[Level 60 Disc IS good, the rest not really, forget HT on uber mobs]<P>Bards:  Songs.  Damage.<BR>[Puretone lasts 2 minutes...very good]<P>Paladins:  Damage.<BR>[Holyforge is good but how many uber mob encounters are undead?]<P>Wizards:  Damage.<P>Note the one thing in common?<P>All these classes can do damage, AND at least 1 other thing.<P>What do the others listed do?<P>Clerics? Keep the damage dealers alive.<P>Shamans?  Buff the damage dealers so they are far more effective.  [Mostly stats/resists]<P>Enchanters?  Buff the damage dealers so they are far more effective.  [Mostly speed/runing]<P>Magicians, Druids, Necromancers...what can they do?<P>Magicians?  Magician pets have immunities to certain kinds of damage.   Wanna try doing the Shaman Epic Quest without a Mage?  Good luck in City of Mist.    Magicians can create mana rods BEFORE a fight and pass out the mana during faster than a necromancer ever can.  <P>Druids?   Good luck getting your spells to land offensively, but at least you can heal people (like the clerics using mana rods...).<P>Necromancers?   Sorry to say, you cannot do damage, you cannot afford to heal anyone (as it kills you), and you can provide enough mana over a one minute period for 2 complete cleric heals.<BR>Your pet is worthless since it has very low AC, low resists, and is so low in level that the amount of damage you do in the 15 seconds it takes for the pet to die doesn't mean anything to mobs with hundreds of thousands of HPs.<BR>Chain cast like the mage, you say?    Sorry takes 15 seconds and 500 mana...no chain casting.<P>All the while your DDs (all 4 of them), DOTs (over a dozen of them, half of which you share/overwrite with Shamans...and none of which stack with other necros dots), and your always memmed spell series, Lifetap, won't land.<P>You think 310 damage for 198 mana is efficient?<P>Its not honestly.   Most necromancers can do around 4K damage IF the Lifetap land...at least the high level nicely geared ones.<P>Assuming  (Magician), Sunstrike (Wizard), or Wildfire (Druid) land they can do the following above our 310/198:<P>Magician:  714 more damage for 122 more mana.<BR>Druid:     714 more damage for 122 more mana.<BR>Wizard:   1305 more damage for 252 more mana.<P>I've seen Magicians and Druids do damage where I can't do much but hope Ignite Blood series lands, which means only *1* Necromancer can cast it, and it takes 90+ seconds to work...and we can't land drains.<P>Right, this makes sense to who?  Why are Necromancers not allowed to lifetap, even after Malo and Tash have both been landed??<P>How are we going to unbalance things?<P>Why can't we simply get the 'no lifetaps here' sign taken down and see how it works?<P>Please?<P>Ayama of Povar, 55 Hereticess<BR>Wanderers of the Stoic<P>http://stoic.aplus.net/</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>&lt;"Why can't we simply get the 'no lifetaps here' sign taken down and see how it works?"&gt;<P>There are ways to "try" it right now, actually. It's just that the epic encounter selection is very much limited.<P>I was in a Wuoshi raid the other day. We failed because of her upgrades after the patch, but that is of no revelance. I was able to land 6 Defluxes in-between the constant stuns, and before I got disemboweled by those 520 dmg claws.<P>I didn't go out of mana and the damage from the taps was 1890 (didn't land any DoTs). Pet was feared the whole time. My wiz friend in the group landed maybe 8 DDs in the same amount of time, also without going OOM. He did more than 6K.<P>At level 60, with a full mana bar, a necro may do a bit over 4K damage with taps. This is far from unbalancing when a wizard in the same situation could do more than three times the damage.<P>Unresistable taps are not too much to ask for.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Not all classes will have all things and be useful in all situations. Simple rule of the game, or there would be only one class.<P>Personally, as an enchanter, on the majority of the raids I go on, I not only welcome a necro, but on occassions insist on one. A well played GROUP necro has abilities that are very valuable to any group. So you don't blast and burn, oh well...it happens. I don't even have nuke spells loaded when I do planar level or higher raids, what's the use?<P>As for the Dot/Poof situation, Absor states that all 55+ mobs shouldn't be affected by it any longer? Why the 55+ level cap? Especially when most planar mobs in Hate and Fear are 48-52 with the exception of the boss mobs? <P>From an enchanter's point of view, I don't like Dot's in a raid situation, and insist that they be removed from the memorized spell sets not because they cause mobs to poof, but because they cause mobs to be unmezable. What happens when you're in hate and you're fighting a dotted Lich, with two rats and a Ghast on hold when a Spite Golem decides to pay a visit. I'll tell you what happens, the primary assist calls a target change, the enchanter ATTEMPTS to mez the dotted lich, and  the party ends up rezzing the enchanter after the battle, if they live, because the two rats and the ghast are coming loose long before the enchanter can be rezed and reloaded with mana/buffs. Just another view on why not to use dots in a high level raid. On singular mobs, such as Trak/Vox/Naggy, yea, they should be usable, but not in a situation where it's possible that bigger and badder mobs can be added to the mix.<P>Back to the well played group necro. I have 3 necros that I regularly spend time in multi-group situations, and I'd take each and everyone of them over some other PLAYERS. Notice I said players, not classes. I've not found one class, when played well, that does not contribute to a well balanced group. That necro that stands at my side and throws a getto mez on an extra mob while I get the other two under control just helped the whole party stay alive that much longer. The necro that sends me a tell in a long, multi-mob battle asking how my mana is doing and pumps some of his/hers to me if needed just helped the whole party live that much longer. That necro that just cast a very agro spell on the mob that's beating me senseless so it leaves me and pays the necro a visit just allowed me to cast a good Dazzle on it to keep it quiet, and enabled the whole party to live. That necro that just pacted me so I can live a bit longer, just helped me to survive, thereby helping me to keep the whole party alive. And that's just what a necro can do to help an enchanter in a raid. I've not even mentioned other classes.<P>So your role changes in later life, and you are now support rather than "I can go and kill anything that moves". My enchanter has been support the whole life of him, and if that helps the party, then so be it. Give me anyone who will help ensure the health and well being of the group over one who can do it all themselves, it makes for a more enjoyable, friendly, and companionship building time, and that's what I'm in this game for, fun, friends and companionship.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>K, I think the VI crew has done a pretty good job of telling you guys your position on the big raids.<P>You're basically useless against the big mob.  Sorry.  =/  You mana battery, and against some of the SoV mobs, you can let your pet go nuts.  ((BTW, for some odd reason, most Necro's that apply to our guild shun the pet until we tell them, "CAST YOUR ****ing PET AND BEAT ON THAT MOB!"  If your pet dies, usually means you left Taunt on or the Tank isn't taunting. =/))<P>But pre-big-mob?<P>Y'know, as a wizard, I'm lugged along for the big fight.  That's about it.  Let's take the infamous Trakanon deal.  You don't need any wizards to make it down there.  Hell, when you're clearing away 6 or 8 juggernauts one after the other, wizards are pretty much afk.  We get summoned down, nuke Trak, leave because, well...honestly, who wants/needs a manna robe anymore?<P>Y'know, recently, we attempted the Dain of the dorf keep.  Wanna know how much dmg I did with a full mana bar?  (Note:  I have roughly 2900 mana.)<P>Guess.<P>7040.  I sat down to med and basically died within seconds because...well....I had hoped I hadn't agro'd Dain that much.  =(<P>Guess how much the three Necro's had done?<P>Between the three of them, they did roughly 30k damage.  Not only to the Dain, but to mobs that were spawning while we were trying to take him down.  Not only that, but with the "Mana battery which we hate to be" kept the Clerics from going manaless early in the fight.<P>Let's put it this way, most classes don't like something they've become.  You think I ~like~ being a lure-battery?  Hell no.  I enjoy being out multi-kiting, I enjoy going to remote locations and charging people absurd amounts for teleports, I enjoy seeing if I can tank a sand giant, I enjoy experimenting on new mobs with various kiting methods.  I groan when I see,<P>"We need more wizards..."<P>Cross the chat channel.  It diminishes how much I value my class.  After a point, a guild recurits wizards because it needs the numbers, not because you're a skilled player.  I can kite mobs in Lguk believe it or not.  Sure, I wouldn't have been able to do it at lvl 45 or so.  Just didn't have the spells.  But now?  That requires skill from a class.<P>Ever play a cleric?  There is ~Nothing~ enjoyable about playing that class.<P>I dunno.  I'm beggining to babble.  Thing is, if you view your entire class as useless because you can't do DD to the big mob, you're commiting the same sin the wizards I ~hate~ did pre-50.  They considered themselves worthless because they couldn't do more then 30% of the damage per mob pulled in grouping situations.  Wizards in groups were safety nets...in case of accident, administer smackdown.<P>For Necro's?  In case of accident, FD and rez the cleric after the mobs leave the area.  Or if nothing else, die and summon corpses to the zone later.  Necro's can turn a 5 hour CR into 20 minutes.  Necro's can give that oom cleric enough mana to get another CH off and keep the main tank from dying.  Necro's can keep accidentally pulled mobs from wiping out the entire raiding party while the big guy is going down.<P>What do wizards do?  I empy 7k dmg into the mob and hope everybody else can kill it before something agro's me.  =/  Sure we're needed for the big raid, but everybody has a role to fill.<P><BR>However, your epic weapon effect just sucks.  HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  heh.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alan, maybe it would be enough to get rid of the illusion skele for chill/ignite, lower the resist rates for our taps a little, and ensure the dot bug is really gone. There, we can do moderate damage, or we can transfer mana more efficiently and get our hps back. I think that is reasonable. At least get rid of the illusion skele and ensure dot bug is GONE. That is simple (I don't mean simple to do, just from a class balance perspective) and both are not working as intended. I am sure no one thought the chill/ignite line would be not allowed because of the illusion. I think it was added as a cool effect (which it is), but the game limitations have made it a bad idea. I really hope Verant sees this as a valid concern and changes things. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ok first of all do corpses not poof only on things lvl 55+ if so my case does not apply, but i believe that vi should set a goal of corpses not poofing at least after lvl 40, many many raid mobs are *not* 55+ most of the mobs in pof and poh in fact.<P>anyway, my experience with mobs poofing:<BR>was doing the phenocryst focus quest, spawned the 3 giants, my enchanter friend was with me, he charmed a giant, we were fighting one of the others... i had several dots on the giant, and the charmed giant and my pet were beeting on it, as the giant was *almost* dead my enchanter friend's charm broke, the giant we were fighting proceeded to die (either from my pet hitting it, or one of my dots, i'm not exactly sure) the corpse poofed. Now i'm not sure if this was specifically a dot bug, it may have been something of a charm bug, or a pet bug. It could be that the dot in fact was the problem, or it could be that because the charmed pet did most of the damage and reverted to an npc that it poofed... in any case i believe that this applies to the situation because it almost surely was caused by problems with the aggro and aggregate damage lists. please fix this, if we can get people to believe that dots wont make corpses poof we *will* be more usefull on raids</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Ooooh boy.<P>Sigh.<P>Anyways, flame me for not knowing anything about the Necro class, because I don't.

I seem to recall talking to you in game about Necro issues a while back (or was it Blaloch).   <P>Personaly, I think VI has totaly screwed up game balance between classes, and us Necros are now one of the more heavily screwed classes.   Between that and what Epic quests have done to the game, I just cant work up the desire to log on most days any more.<P>Good luck getting our issues addressed, lord knows I campaigned for a good while there.  Seems most of our class are dropping off fast... of the 60 necros, when was the last time you've seen Nico or Kruella on as their mains?  Come to think of it, the only high end necros I seem to see on very often anymore are Antihera and Heeson.  Guess some people have a higher burnout resistance then others.

</FONT><HR>Absor<P>We never asked to do "massive" amounts of damage. We asked to be ABLE to do ANY damange.  As it is currently we can do NO damage!  Repeat NO damage.<P>My guild is doing Fear again this weekend.  One of the standing rules was NO DOTS!  Even though your posts was brought up, the answer was NO.  Anyone found using dots faced being not invited to future raids!!  What necro who finds it hard enough to get in a raid grp is gonna jeopardize it by Verant promises of a fix, that Sorry we have heard before and been wrong.  Will Verant change the policy so GMs can offer loot that the mob would have dropped had it not poofed?<P>Even if we used DOTS Absor you forgot that only one dot of that spell can be active on the mob.  Now necros share those dots with Shamans, Druids, etc.  So again necros would be limited in number!  If only two dots stack why bring a third necro??<P>Pardon Absor but Summon Corpse happens after the raid NOT during the uber encounter.  I can camp my necro at the zone in and play my twink until it is time to do CR.  Same with DMF before the fight.  Oh you keep mentioning lots of things we can do, but your three examples pretty much are what everyone here has posted, name one other useful thing that we are not mentioning? Please dont mention rezz that happens AFTER the RAID not during the UBER ENCOUNTER and will only be used if no clerics camped or survived.<P>Absor my necro is my only 50+ charater and likely to be my only 50+ charater.  I have one twink I rarely play.  I am very disheartened that my role has changed after this much time.  I will NOT change classes and powerlevel to 50+ again, but will just quit EQ if things dont change for the necro.  WHats the point for me?  I cant do what I love doing - being offensive, which is why I chose the necro.  I dont like being a cleric or enchanter, I tried and didnt like it so I deleted those charaters.<P>I thought your example of enchanters cant mezz Trak and that is their main role is sooo off base.  You dont mezz single mobs!  IF the raid goes right, you engage the uber mob solo so no mezzing is needed.  And if the enchanters cant mezz the mob our ST isnt going to either.  Theres another one of our (poor) skills made useless.<P>Lifetaps should land on uber mobs.  THere not "massive" damage, they have long casting times, and have poor damage to mana ratios.  It is what necros do and is class defining.  If we cant lifetap back HPs we wont be using our reverse lifetaps on grp folks will we now.<P>The Illusions are a sad consequence of the game evolving and causing a unique idea to become a liability to this class.  In addition, to the problems posted with the illusion, no other necro can land this spell if it has already and the mob is in the skellie illusion.  Again making multiple necros not wanted nor useful.  Another potential spell that might not/will not be cast.<P>Also Absor this is the case with ALL uber mobs, NOT just a few or some but ALL. Why?  I dont think we would complain if say others classes had this same impotent problem on certain creatures but they dont.<P>Necros cant chain casts pets, to survive the AOE spells of uber mobs.  Sorry the casting time is WAAAY to long for that.  Our pets die in the 1-2 round of battle - I dont think Jabors 1-2 hits is gonna make a BIG contribution.  Add to that the risk of trains they can cause and its no wonder their outlawed by most guilds on raids.<P>Absor I appreciate the attempt you have made.  But I still wish for the necro talk thread to discuss all the necro issues like the not-so-epic weapon of ours; the essence emerald spells; nite time only spells, etc.  I honestly believe you are just beginning your education on some of the classes issues.<P>Absor thank you for the responses, I honestly disagree with you, and hope we can have a honest discussion of these issues.  We just want to be what we were for 50 levels.<P>Thanks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would like a simple oak coffin for my dead necro please. <P> I now truely wish Verant had never even introduced the Necromancer as a class. YOU goofed it up, not us. If the other classes had half the crap and abilities that they do now at the start of EQ, nobody would be saying squat about Necros "paying" for their ability to kill birds and trees at lower levels. Instead you took a stab in the dark and hit right on the money with Necros, but missed by a long shot on the others. So now we get labeled as a "god class" and are meant to pay for our sins as such. <P> I swear to God I can still remember GZ and even the legendary Abashi himself replying to a disgruntled Shaman post a while back, basically complaining that he could not give his pets weapons to buff the speed of their pet. The response from Abashi and GZ was almost identical. "Its just one of those things Necros can do that other classes cant." - "The ability for Necros to buff their pets with low delay weapons is not a bug, it is an ability that the Necromancer has that others do not. You are not a primary pet class..yadda yadda yadda." Not even two weeks after that statement was made they completely flip flopped on the issue and suddenly it was a bug, and the necros were all made to look like horrible exploiters for doing such a thing. <P> So just what the hell is a Necromancer anyway? At least in Verants eyes. Who sat down and invisioned all of this? It certianly was not someone who had a clue what the term Necromancer actually means. At first, the original design team had a really good impression. They did a wonderful job, all our spells are based on long torturous deaths and the ability to control, manipulate, and destroy the undead. Sounded great. But then all of a sudden, were nerfed into being fuzzy little elfish imp passing out mana candy. Gone are the days of the power hungry evil disease slinging necromancer. Enter the new age Necro with soul crystals in hand and a bright orange robe on chanting mantras and protesting animal lab testing. Bleh...<P> Ahhhh the good old days. When a spell could be cast...and it would work damnit! Why, when I was your level, we had to kite in the snow uphill both ways! Now look at ya...with yer clothes and your hair. Damn hippies, thats all you are. When I was a young Teir'Dal, we didnt have these fancy shmancy mana transfers. We were tough! We ate crocs for lunch! And by God we liked it that way!<P> Ok, in all seriousness though...just bury us Absor and get it over with. Use your Direct Damage spell of Oblivion on us instead of drawing it out with the DoT of Uselessness. Kinda ironic that Necros as a class would die the same exact way we USED TO kill with? Long, slow, and painful.<BR> <BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alan,<P>You say that only 55+ mobs are raid encounters.  Cazic is 53 i belive.  In Western Wastes i have seen a tun of blue dragons and killed many of them in raiding situations and even had one poof.  Not because of a Dot but because of a LD player that got the kill.  Please fix the LD players also.  Now many mobs in planes are not 55+ I think the this should be changed to a lot lower than 55+.  Also what would be wrong with changing the resistances of say all taps that are 54 or higher?  You speak highly of necros because of their ability to summon corpses.  But yet coffins are not stackable and are containers therefore players can not cary them with them.  Sure necros get an upgrade at 57 but that is very higher for a much needed upgrade at lower levels.  I can't wait for conjure corpse because i will then finnaly be able to do summoning of corpses without waiting 2 hours to get a coffin to me.  Also coffins are sold in Nerriak and Sky.  As an iksar i start out KoS how am i supposed to get coffins?  Don't you think you could at least put a coffin vender in a few more places?  Sure necros can FD and clear agro then res a cleric in a whipe.  Thats a great ability and is worth an essance emrald.  But what use is 1100 mana and/or 1200 point lifetap that costs an essance emrald?  Not to mention why would we use a 1200 point lifetap on any mob other than a big encounter (it has a long refresh time, requires an essance emrald, and also has a long casting time have fun getting it off before fear hits you or the mob moves out of meele range)  Not to mention it will be resisted.  Lastly one more pet peave i have is the necro class is focused around life/mana.  They swap back and forth between the two and even give it to others.  Now when you make mobs immune to tap you not only make it immune to tap but you make the necro no longer able to lich/pact.  The necros core is his lifebar that he controls when tap wont stick they no longer have no control.<P>Thanks for reading all of this<BR>Rekna</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I played a dwarven cleric named Albrecht Hammerfell since EQ came out. I played him almost to lvl 53 before I had decided to quit the game back in May. I saw something dreadfully wrong with the cleric class at the time, and still see that problem with them now. Clerics were becoming "too useful". Being a high lvl cleric was a tough job, because now, with Death penaties being so extreme in the 50+ game, resses were hardly ever just absorbed. Also, I discovered with Kunark, that a cleric was more and more pigeonholed into the most boring routine in the world. Buff, Med, CH, Med, Rebuff, Repeat. Gating mobs, weakness of the other healing classes, harder hitting mobs, these things took out the versatility that the cleric used to have. To maximize efficiency, a cleric would have to be ass-sitting at all times save Buffing and CHing, oh... other than Ressing of course. The "Fun" factor of the cleric was going from low, to minimal, and I did not see that changing. Since I quit, the Cleric pet was nerfed, The Mark of Karn was nerfed, and now the Donal's bp and the PoG chestplate. Albrecht is now 56 with the Cleric FA, but is played now by my guild leader and friend, as he now has the time to devote to the 55+ game that I do not.<P>Now that I came back to the game after a 7 month layoff, I restarted as a necromancer. He is now lvl 38, and I have been grouping the whole time. Necromancers are extremely versatile in a group setting from 1-50. Its great. <P>The problem is that everyone who plays this game post 55 knows that the 55-60 game is 90% about epic encounters now, especially with Velious. On my server, many of the old timer necros who were truly devoted to thier class have now either left their class to start a wiz, rogue, or monk... or just quit the game entirely in disgust. That not a good thing, no matter how much classenvy or misguided hatred there is toward the necro class. <P>The simple solution? Lifetaps should NOT be 100% resisted on ubermobs. No way. Lifetapping is an ESSENTIAL element to the necro's role. It works in conjunction with the Lich line, which in turn "helps" facilitate the necro's apparent NEW class role, that of the cleric/wizard manabattery. At least if lifetaps were given a chance to hit, then the necro could actually both DO minor damage AND be a better manabattery. As it stands now, Necros use their lvl 44 buff on people, send a pet in who misses so often it makes little difference, and also manabattery till they no longe can, then log out to alleviate lag. <P>Sound fun? <P>Welp. Apparently, fun really isnt a prerequisite in game balance anymore. See Clerics.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Umm hello Talamay.<P>When you look at the spell list for shaman, what do you see? BUFFS MOSTLY! You picked a buffing class. This is like a cleric complaining about being forced to heal and buff, look at the spell list smart guy, if 80% of your spell list is focused on something, don't expect to be all that great in the few spells that cover the other 20%.<P>In other words, you will not get any sympathy for clerics wanting to do a better job in being a damage dealing class. They are focused as a support class. An to a lesser extant, the same is true for enchanters.<P>Yet, for necros, in a raid, the whole class is reduced to a few spells<P>Mana Dump<BR>Summon Corpse<BR>DMF<P>THAT'S IT! You can not land taps, forget DoT'ing, the pets have such a poor amount of hp for the 53rd, 56th, and 60th pet, that any uber mob will rip them apart to say nothing of the fun if the pet gets feared or the mob taps. Oh, and since you can not land taps, forget about using lich to help regen mana to dump, since the spell will kill a necro pretty damn fast, with 32 pts of damage per tick.<P>So, the necro class is the only class, that can throw out 90% of their spells when working with raids. <P>Yep, that is the Vison, I just wish it would go blind already.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have retired my necro because of verants uninformed post. Sorry guys (verant) you just dont have a clue of what would make a necro happy. It isnt being all powerful or being "the most wanted class" in a raid..its being effective in a raid.<P>I will NOT be a mana tank.<BR>I will NOT sit around till the end to summon bodies.<BR>I will NOT accept your bad pathing that involves me in not being abile to use my pet.<BR>I will NOT accept your fears off 50 damn necros getting together and tapping some umber mob to death. If you didnt know guys this is why it was nerfed in the first place.<BR>I will NOT accept that I cant use my DD's in a raid because of the illusion it produces.<BR>I will NOT accept the role as a "utility" class.<P>All in all I quit this most depressing class. If you want somebody to summon your body get a sk to do it, since they are getting the spell soon anyway. (yeah I know its in testing, but I also know that very few things have not made it past the test server).<P>He is the link to my retirement post. <BR>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/044658.html<P>Imortal/Snoop</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok im gonna list what I know to add to this discussion.  I have played a necro ever since I started playing... picked the class (Necro) and Race (Dark Elf) out well before I even purchased the game.  I have played it and played it as my primary, and spent countless game hours on her.  Here is my conclusions based on all I read.<P>1. When I first started I soloed a lot.. it was easy made this class look like a breeze.<P>2. As I've gone up in levels I usually cannot solo most blue con mobs on the continent of Velious becuase of 2 things.. 1 I run out of mana.. or 2 they hit so incredibly hard my whimpy pets cant take the blow.  <P>So now I cant solo as much.. Hey thats not so bad I can group right?  Well thats not true either... Here is how my typical group situation goes... I ask to get in a group... no response.. someone yells they need members I send a tell get a response back nope we need healer or tank...  Goes on like this for a hour or so... finally some poor soul feels sorry for me and I get a group... k offer DMF to the group if we are not in a zone that disallows its use.  K well no one takes it "they are sick of bobbing up and down" k well I can tolerate that I didnt play a necro to buff other classes... So mob comes up the fight starts... Ignite Bones.. K well ive seen 2 things happen here... 1. the mob turns into the skelly and the tanks turn around to look for the mob... it kills 1 while it laughs and cackles like my pet... or 2. (velious is bad about this) another NPC doesnt like illisuions and turns to beat on the skelly I have seen a whole group of mobs turn on its companion because I cast it on this.... Do you know what happens when NPC1 kills NPC2? corpse poof... no exp... wasted my mana... k well that didnt work... lets address being a mana battery... K well since i cant tap most these mobs.. its gonna be the clerics job to heal me... hmm why is that cleric healing the tank when im giving him mana to heal me some... gee im losing life pretty fast when guess i gotta beg this enchanter for clarity2 so i can give mana to the group...<P>Do you see how useless this is? and then you made the point of "BUT YOU ARE THE ONLY CLASS WHO CAN SUMMON A CORPSE" However... there is a post that sks will get the 39 summon corpse spell... so now... if your smart take a sk on your raid for the corpse recovery at least he can tank... <P>So as you can see i have very little skills...<P>1. NO travel skills cant gg so I cant be used for evac etc.<P>2. Cant use a pet in 99% of the dungeons cause it is so mindless it falls through floors runs through walls.. ends up on  other sides of the zone or runs back and forth 50 times to reach a mob 2 feet in front of it.<P>3. How can i give mana to another class a decent rate without clarity since I cant regaiin my life back?<P>4. Why take me to summon corpse if the sk's are to recive that as well.. or why not jsut call me in for cleanup but leave me out of the raid entirly.. just call me the janitor... i clean up corpses all day long.<P>5. IF the dot mob issue is fixed im very glad BUT our pet was always our strongest point in my opinion not our DOTS.. and i Cant use that<P>Absor please look at this.. Think about it pass it on do what you can.. I want to be useful.. I dont want to out tank I dont want to out dmg a wizzy but I want to be able to do something worthwhile later.. and right now I cant..<BR>But i Dont want to be a janitor to clean up the corpses after the raid and I dont want to be a very poor battery to other casters.. When they are better off taking a good chanter...<P>:-(</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Seems the Abashi played his necro only to the mid levels then SOLD the necros out, because he never really understood the necro past that lvl. <P>Now his replacement understands us even LESS and we are losing it all.  <P>Thanks guys!!!<P>ABASHI STATED NECROMANCERS ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT WILL HAVE SUMMON CORPSE.  (Ummm what happened???)<P>It appears that necros have been raped, beaten, and now locked outside in the cold.  Many don't like thier class Post-50 and here is one more reason. <P>As to Absor's comments ----&gt; <P>CLERIC's are needed - a must have in ever group that is tank heavy - a must have on raids. <P>NO way you can compare healing to transfering MANA unless you lack an understanding for both classes.  <P>(Find me on my server...you'll see me on my cleric.  You don't see me complaining about him.  Why Cleric is Awesome.) <P>On the other hand...you have killed what the necros do.  There prime role has changed and has very little usefulness on raids.   <P>Cleric know they will heal from day 1.  They know they will be the best healers in the game.  <P>Necros know they are damage dealers from day 1.  However that could have had no clue that they would turn into a utility class (with very little need) and there prime abilities would be given away. <P>ALL IN ALL GIVE THE NECRO THE NEW FD...then will be a bit more joyous. <P>WE WANT THE NEW FD...OURS BY RIGHT!!! <P>(and make the lifetap series useful on main mobs)<BR>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
