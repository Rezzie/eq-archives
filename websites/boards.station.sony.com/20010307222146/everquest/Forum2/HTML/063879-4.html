</FONT><HR>ROFL ROFL ROFL ROFL.<P>Uber Cleric Nerf #5.<P>Ive been around since day 1 of commercial release (we like to call this Phase 5 Beta), and Ive played my cleric mainly.  The simple fact of the matter is that the cleric community has been lied to over everyone of these major nerfs. {Manastone, MOK, Heal Aggro, Donals, and now POG bps}.  Eventually someone would make a contradictory statement and the truth would come out, not that it mattered much.  We still got shafted.  <P>VI, you are systematically destroying a class, in terms of fun to play and originality.  And this is not an overstatement.  Every item weve had that has set us apart, *nerf*.  Every spell weve had that made us "clerics" has been passed out to other classes.  And dont give me the "you do it better line", because its not relavant.  When you narrow the gap as far as you have, who does it better becomes irrelavant, because there are so many ppl doing it.  <P>What is clearly obvious is that you are attempting to slow the progression of the high end game via direct attacks on the one class that is 100% vital to those endevours.  You can scream "class and game balance" all you want, but actions speak louder than words.  Items and spells that are equal or greater in thier abuses are left in game, untouched, and unchanged.  What I find *HIGHLY* amusing, is that this backwards logic is going to bite you in the ass in the coming months.  Your attempt to slow the player base is not only going to backfire, but cost you dollars when alternate gaming choices start arriving on the shelves.  My account with my level 60 cleric is gone.  Ill be clicking /cancel on this account after I complete this post, and adding a DAoC bookmark to my explorer favorites folder.<P>My disgust with your treatment of your player base, and the cleric class in general has gone beyond anger.  Now, I can only shake my head and laugh bitterly.<P>Stylean SilverSteel<BR>60 Cleric (permanently retired)<BR>Solusek Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Nothing personal but you don't know how to handle a situation.  Instead of talking to the group you make decisions with no player input.  And while I don't think you need to talk to the players about everything but as far as the clerics nerf you do.  You need to make them understand what you are going to do to make it up to them.<P><BR>Suggesions ideas are:<BR>1. Make casting items with heals give "more" hate then the spells with their same name.  You complain that a cleric can keep a warrior alive infinitely if he can outheal the monsters damage output.<BR>2. The spells use components<BR>3. The spells use mana but less then their non-equipment counterparts (think half the cost).  This combined with long casting times will guarentee that a cleric will eventually run out of mana.<BR>4. The items ad "mana" over time.<P>Don't do silly nerfs of "1 min casting time" or "removing the item."  Fix the problem in another way.<P>Regardless of what you say, the only thing visible to the players is you won't work through a problem, you will simply suppress it.<P>Is your official stance that no item will ever have a heal spell because potentially it can be used to make infinite combat?  If you, the developer of the game, can't find a way to improve the game to allow such items.  Then perhaps you need to accept your days are numbered.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Okay, I'm prefacing this by saying I did not read past the first page of posts...but I wanted to say a couple things.<P>First...for everyone who thinks the BP works for twinking - think again...CE cannot be cast on someone of low level, much like the highest buffs we have.<P>Second...I hunt with a rogue nearly every time I'm doing something that isn't with the guild as a whole.  I have tried to chain cast CE on him using the BP, but it's impossible.  You simply cannot keep up with the damage being dealt by a blue mob - we are both level 60.<P>Third...Verant:  If you are going to nerf our BP's beyond use - which is what you are doing - be fair to those of us who spent many hours obtaining items that you have now deemed too powerful for our use.  It is not our fault that you put an item into the game that was not tested as thoroughly as it should have been.  The only fair thing to do here would be to offer clerics the option to have their existing BP's replaced with whatever BP's you replace in the drop table.<P>Fourth...I wouldn't be talking so much about how nice our epic weapons are - I bet they are next.<P>~Arele Nyxx<BR>&lt;Afterlife&gt;</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Verant you need to ask yourselves a few questions:<P>Is the cleric class actually playable now?<BR>Answer should be NO<P>Is the cleric class fun to play?<BR>Answer should be NO<P>Do we need to do something positive for this class?<BR>Answer should be YES<P>Do we need to maybe totally readdress what we said we would do for balance for this class?<BR>Answer should be YES<P>I guess I could go on and on but I think you should be getting the point this is outrageous and a pox mark on verants hide.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I expect many clerics will leave, because they sense the death of the cleric class and do not want to cast resurrection on it. I am pretty dissapointed in how blind you all are. Are you sure the whiteout didnt fall over in your offices? Or are you passing around the company crack pipe?  I really hope you make a quest mob that you turn in your PoG BP and it gives you the new one, AND gives back your faction to indifferent.

</FONT><HR>I see this is not a very good way to treat the primary healers of the game.  Verant cries that they have given players a item (many actually) that makes it to easy for them.  Although this is the same deisgners and programers that put in quad hitting thousands of damage mobs with over the old 32k hitpoint limits. <P>Verant cries that "the players are too powerful" when they intentionally put mobs in the game that are designed to whipe out even the most uber of guilds.  The complain that since a person has a "uber" item that in a normal situation it makes gives them a unfair advantage.  This is very poor taste for Verant to decide the high level healing items that (that are not a option but a necessity with most 60+ mobs) should be retroactively nerfed. <P>If Verant wants to do something right for a change, balance the mobs to the players.  They cry about balance, but all they are doing is making sure that the uber mobs in the game remain next to impossible to defeat by uber players with uber equipment.  <P>BTW your new AGGRO system is a farce.  Not only is it very "balanced" in to killing even the most skilled and aged players, but changing the "rules" of engagement so very very late at release is a joke.  This wasn't about balance or something being broken.  Verant didn't write this system to be over 50 at first, and now that they have to go back and clean up the code, they would rather rewrite a new system and make it a totally new cluster #&^%. <P>When Verant says something is off balanced or needs to be nerfed, its becuase they themselves are too lazy to go in and fix it right the first time.  When they say something can not be done at all, it is simply because they do not wish it.  They have some of the best code writers in the mmorg industry, and nothing is impossible.  It's due to laziness.<P>Just to end this nice little notice, they are doing their best to make this game unbeatable in a attempt to keep their customer base.  This is a very poor way to go about it, and in the end will drive your customers away.  I am not moveing on to "Star Wars" or any other game Verant will release.  I will on the other hand be very open minded in to seeing and exploring the competition and what they have learned from Verants faults.  They are watching and trying to do it better than this company.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First you nerfed donal breastplate based on the formula that 4 or so clerics could keep a warrior alive in combat unless the NPC could kill him in x number of seconds.. Now you nerf the elixir BPs based on the same formula.. How long is it going to take you to realize that 4 clerics with clarity 2 and a bard singing cantana can do the same thing cycling complete heal on a tank and never run out of mana? Guess you have to nerf complete heal now huh? Or maybe make clerics immune to mana regen effects such as clarity or bard songs? Ohh I know! Remove the cleric class entirely because there isn't anything left of it anyway anymore!!<P>I play a level 58 cleric and over the past couple of months I have seen you take bit after bit from the cleric class and now it's been reduced to something that's not a class anymore.. I feel like I am in the same seat today like I was in january 2000 when I stopped playing my paladin and switched to cleric due to the total uselessness of the paladin at that time, now I am going back to my paladin, since they have gotten a bunch of updates recently, if I decide not to cancel my account..

</FONT><HR>I have a question on the change to the BPs<P>If you make it a one minute cast time - doesn't that create a situation in which the cleric must be stationary and non-attacked for a full minute before casting?  That seems completely useless.<P>Why not create a new spell with the same or similar effect like you did for the Donal's BP of Mourning nerf?  My suggestion would be to analyze when this spell would be cast - post nerf.  <P>If its only going to be cast after combat - make it a 60 second heal over time that does the same total healing as Celistial Elixer.  My calcs show that would be a 95 point heal every 6 seconds for 11 ticks (instead of a 200 point heal every 6 seconds for 5 ticks). <P>Wouldn't that be more play balancing?<P>Forin Ironshield<BR>Paladin of Underfoot<BR>Tunare<BR>Aegis Wolves</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The breastplate wasn't overpowering when compared to the game. It was overpowering compared to Druids and Shamans.<P>It just hit me that Verant is trying to make Druids and Shamans equal healers to Clerics. That means upgrading Druids and Shamans' healing powers and nerfing Clerics. If so, the nerfs may actually continue beyond the breastplate.

</FONT><HR>Well, clerics are definitely going to get paranoid being hit so many times in a row with the Nerf bat. I think Verant needs to learn to balance the swings with the nerf bat with carrots so that people don't feel like their class is being horribly disembowled.<P>I'm usually not one to get overly alarmed by nerfs, but at this point with the changes to hate lists and the BP nerf I am starting to feel a bit edgy.<P>The question that keeps ringing in my mind is:<P>Clerics are pretty scarce now and the 50+ game is difficult or impossible without sufficient clerics.  Does Verant realize this and want to distribute cleric abilities out to more classes because of this?  <P>There's other classes that are pretty critical too (enchanters being the main one) and fairly rare.  Will this happen to them as well?<P>Is this good for the game?  Well, in retrospect perhaps there are too many classes, but lordy, the main reason people play clerics is because they are so desirable in groups.  If you make them less popular then I don't see a heck of a lot of reason to continue to play.<P>If this isn't the reasoning going on inside Verant then I think they should stop swinging the nerf bat so hard at clerics or start throwing us something nice.  They're just breeding a lot of paranoia and it is terribly contagious!

Clerics are not a fun class to play, they were in Unrest in my teens, but not since then.  You can only have so much fun buffing and healing, this BP was a new type of something interresting for us to do.  Clerics suddenly became quite a cool thing to have around.  Plus, the graphics on the BP are soooooooo cool.<P>Please dont take it away, it was just starting to be fun.<P>2 years and 3 lvl 50+ characters later... maybe im just burning out.

</FONT><HR>What people have to realize is that the Live Team have the maturity of 12 year olds. You know, the GM you played D&D with after school, who would have 5 dragons kill your party on the way back to town because you dared to actually live through his killer dungeon?<P>Every time I see a 'balance adjustment', that mental picture comes to me, because that's exactly what Verant is doing. They designed a game, the players came up with an unexpected tactic so the nasty players have to be punished because they aren't playing the right way.<P>Here's a clue for you Verant, a truth which I have held firmly in mind for 20 years of DM'ing various games:<P>If you design an encounter with only 3 ways out of it... the players will find a 4th.<P>Wake up, you pathetic losers. Stop crying to mommy cause the nasty players didn't die to your newest uber-mob as much as they were supposed to.<P>This game isn't for you. It's for US. Making it and keeping it up is your job. Punishing us for having fun is NOT.<P>Another clue: Every time a thousand players tell you something is broken, you swear it isn't, we don't know the mecanics, we're idiots, etc.<P>Then a couple weeks/months later, you fix it.<P>Do you have even the slightest clue how STUPID you all look to the playerbase? We, the players, KNOW that you are all basically clueless, despite your claims that you play and have high level characters. We know you change things without the slightest clue what you're doing, because WE suffer through the resulting mess for long periods before someone finally fixes them.<P>Here's a dollar... buy a clue. You need a few, badly.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If the game is broken really broken by uber-healing at the over 51 level(as it is asserted by VI), then make your changes(after complete testing please for bugs and unforseen consequences - see Test Server now to get my meaning), but before you implement the changes, review the class (classes) most effected by the change and make proportional improvements to that class (classes) to offset what they lost in "fixing the game".  Do both the nerf and improvement at the same time.  This may not be a  perfect solution but at least make an effort to both help the "Vision" and players hard earned Characters.<P>To just outright nerf some class (classes) over and over and over to the point of people actually getting physically and emotionally upset at the thought of what has happened to their character(s) that they have played, for some, up to 2 years is just sadistic.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 8 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063879-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063879.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063879-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063879-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063879-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063879-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063879-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063879-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=063879&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=063879&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
