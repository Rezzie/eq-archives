It's the meaning and intent you showed in some places in your dialog.<P>    And yes...  I could misread things or misunderstand things...

</FONT><HR>Diablo II is just a game.  Age of Empires is just a game.  Warcraft is just a game.  (If all offline, of course).  Its just you and the computer.  You sit and play what the designer programmed as your experience.<P>However EQ, UO and AC are not "just a game". They are societies.  The experience is governed by the actions of real people.  The experience involves real life people interacting with other real life people.  They have the same dynamics as if this was home, work, church or school.  You meet others and make bonds with them.  You return day after day to spend time with your friends.<P>People are upset with this GM because there is an expectation that people should be civil to one another.  Apparently he is not.  If it were just a game, then there would be no basis for such an expectation.<P>To limit ones view of EQ as a just a game is both short sighted and a protection system so you can deny any real attachment.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This reminds me of high profile trials. Its amazing how the law can be read to suit your needs. Guilty are innocent and innocent convicted all the time using loopholes in the law; ignoring commonsense application of that law.<P>Managirl Beachbums and those who use such names are no different. You know good and well its beyond the naming convention guidlines, but you do it anyway because by interpreting the rules, you can always find a way to justify it. You forget the fact that the reason we even have rules like this in place is to prevent stupid names, and names that offend. Sure it may be cute, some are even funny, but the fact remains, that dispite what many argue EQ is or has turned out to be, the premise of EQ is/was a fantasy/roleplaying environment. <P>When you introduce cheese names like Managirl Beachbum, what you basically have is the Dungeon & Dragons effect, those of you who have seen that sorry movie know what I mean. Introducing real world slang in this environment really stagnates the feel of the game.<P>I'm not anal about names, I see cheesy names that should be changed everytime I log on.<P>Here is a few on the server I am on to name a few<BR>Nastylove<BR>Perfection<BR>Prochoice<BR>Burnsobburn<P>I have never petitioned the names, frankly its more trouble than its worth to me, but I can't help thinking that the older this game gets, the more the effort to keep the fantasy atmosphere true fades away. Remember, the rules are not there just to protect people from offensive names, they are there to keep the atmosphere/feel (ie no stupid names) of the game true. Is it really so hard to play the game as intended?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>randonloggin,<P>   hehe...  You mix things here.  This woman don't need therapy.  She had a crying spell because she was hurt by something.  Shock would do that.  And even if you and Oceanus keep bringing up the rules... Doesn't mean she wasn't shocked.  Doesn't mean she didn't get hurt.<P>   He didn't say she hasn't eaten since.  He didn't say she's been so depress, she's been home sick... She cried.  Who's stretching what ?  Do either of you like to be poked at when you did an Ooops.  I'm sure you made mistakes in your life...  Did you like people telling you "I told you so"... "Good, you deserved it!".  That's the kind of talk some teanager had... you know, the "Ignorant" ones...  Cause they didn't care of others feeling, and for some reason... they felt superior to put someone even lower when they were down...  To what cause ?<P>I still say her name was not in Violation, and so do many.  Well, that's my opinion.  And even if it was, there was nothing wrong with it.  Why did the GM get so harsh about it ?  Because it's a rule...  So if I see you cross a road, and you're not doing on the Cross Walk... Can I deck you and beat the crap out of you for braking a rule ?  Should I even say anything ?  Or keep my mouth shot ?  If you get hit by a car, should I come near you and say... You must be ignorant... everyone knows you're not supposed to do that... and walk away with a snicker...<P>Game are not...  The way some of you responded to this post is with lack of Tack, and ignorance... What are you two ignorant about ?  That Other people don't see the world the way you do.  Other dont have the lack of sensitivity you have.  Others feel different about EQ than you do.  It's not all about you two...  Everyone is different...

</FONT><HR>JCDDreamer, I appreciate the humanity of your posts.<P>Of course EQ is more than "just a game" to many people.  Investing an emotional attachment to ANYTHING you devote a lot of time with is entirely normal, acceptable, and healthy.  Yes, this includes characters in virtual world games.<P>It also includes animals, fictional characters in books, cars, keepsakes, and all sorts of seemingly "trivial" items.  Of COURSE the name is meaningful to this person.  OF COURSE it hurt when it was summarily destroyed by an insensitive, over-reaching GM.  <P>It is only considered "unhealthy" if those attachments lead to destructive behavior.<P>It seems to me that the poster and his wife do indeed have a "grip".  She played in a very nice, responsible way; she became emotionally attached to something she spent some time with and found relaxing and enjoyable; she reacted emotionally (read: like a human) when stripped of the name she had grown fond of; her husband posted in a very reasonable, likeable way, and was also affected by the hurt felt by his wife.  <P>We need more people like these two playing the game, and fewer of those who choose to use intellectual justifications as an excuse to engage in hurtful, unwarranted attacks on others.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Lisset, LOL<P>Pretty weak that you have to join in the Bang Wagon with Oceanus to try to get to me... on a word.  Could have tried to come back on what I said about you instead.... hehe<P>As for Oceanus.  As much as "Sh*t" has a different impact in one State to another in the US.  The word Ignorant has different impact depending on where you live.  Upraising could also be a factor.  Because a parent refuses to tell their Kids they are "Ignorant" so they don't feel like they are inferior (Lack of knowledge)... Does not mean they feel so when it is heard or read.  Yet again, Oceanus... You chose to take text value from a book and not the different understanding in the world of that same word.  Or it's impact.  In the same way where you know the Rule, and it's not bendable and you're way to understand it is the only way.  Also in the same way you say this woman needs help, and everyone should probably agree with you.<P>Dictionary will give you the description of a word.  How you use it, and where you use it has a different impact.<P>Oh, I'm semi Ignorant on the Mac... got one on my desk.. 1 of my 5 PC's well...   But I can say I'm totally Ignorant about Cars.  Well, if I was to talk to someone here... I'd replace the word "Ignorant" with the word "Clueless".  For some reason, it doesn't feel as strong...  Probably cause it's the way people talk here...  Does that make me more Ignorant than you ?  Or is it the fact that you refuse to take into account that the word itself has a different impact in other places in the world ?<P>You see Oceanus.  I might not know what's in the dictionary...  But I hell know that If I go across the Hallway to my Boss's office and talk about something I'm working on... and if he says he doesn't understand lets say JavaScript...  Should I say "Sorry, I didn't know you were Ignorant about JavaScript".  Can you say, Pink Slip.  If the word is considered innapropriate, then you acknoledge that it is insulting.  If you say my Boss would be overeacting... They you are totally Clueless of the environment I live in and work in.<P>Same with other peoples emotion, belief, and reactions to things.  Everyone is different.  This is a big world we're in...  What you see around you, the people... could be totally foreign 100 mile away in another Community.  THIS is what I've been hinting at about all along when people just sprang up insults.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Related or not, here is my opinion on some particular names.<P>I have a real life and I also play EQ. I like it becuase it is a people game and not a man's game or a woman's game. It is socially well balanced.<BR>I group with booth men and women in the game without bias. Maybe even more women as I am a gig blue handsome guy.<BR>However! I am uncomfortable grouping with people that would carry a name like, Imagirl, EQgirl, Thisgirl, singlegirl, Nastygirl, Nicegirl, or anything of that nature. People with names like that tend to broadcast their gender and seem to be in the game more to socialize than to roleplay the game. If I wanted to socialize in that manner I would have joined a chat community and not a game community. Managirl may have not intended to broadcast her intent, but I would have taken it that way. So if her hobby is this game and not to socialize, maybe she is better off with a different name. Only takes a day to let everyone know that your name is changed. Not a big deal really unless you want to broadcast your availability to other men for intimate online chat.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>fridayjones and USMCR (and even, for the most part JCDDreamer) are right on the money.<P>EverQuest is a NOT just a game. It is a hobby, pasttime, social circle, and more.<P>randonloggin, goofu, and Oceanum_FOH, we understand your points. But you need to just relax. We don't know that the original poster is a troll, but either way, the point brought up is valid.<P>- The name girl is not a title. Father and Mother are religious titles.<BR>- Being trained or KS'ed is less of a reason to be emotional than having your name changed.<P>The point of the post was that this person's wife had the name of their main, or only, character changed with not much warning. Nobody doubts that if she had been given a little more time she might not have been as upset.<P>Just because she cried does not mean that she is unstable or needs help or that her husband is not paying enough attention to her. In fact if they are both playing EQ, he is probably spending a lot of time with her.<P>She had a lot invested in that collection of bits and bytes. Time, effort, and yes, even some emotional attachment. That is normal. Not understanding that is cold hearted and not understandable.<P>People, this is a game, played by people. The GM should have given her more time to change the name if he felt it inappropriate (which it obviously wasn't).<P>Just relax. Managirl needs to take the next step and petition and/or call customer service.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>randonloggin... LOL<P>Did it EVER cross your mind that she might have thought her name was legal.  You've got half the people in this 8 page of post saying it's legal, and the other half saying not.  Even if she was wrong in the end, can't you even comprehend that she might have thought she was in the right all along.  It said in there you can use 2 word or more, as long as it's not a phrase...  "Mana Girl" is 2 words.  Well, a GM thought of it differently.  Fine!  But don't put someone down for thinking differently than you, and not figuring things out you did.  So bad that people like judging and Critisize (something like that... hehe).<P>Too many people think the world revolves around them.  This is how I think, how dare you think differently.  You have to read the rules, up and down... page 1 to 150 of everything.  Refrigerator manual, Microwave, Car, Computer, Printer, every game you've ever played... And damn you if you ever get caught with something you should have read in any of these books...  Anyone else feels like walking on egg shells here ?

</FONT><HR>Sometimes I am truly astounded at the idiocy some people post. The worst idiot is one who doesn't realize it.<P>Look girls cry, men cry on occasion.<P>Girls cry at MOVIES. Which they have no emotional investment in. Which they have not spent over a year creating themselves.<P>So the ONLY logical conclusion of you idiots' predicate is that all women who cry at movies, or anything less than death or catastrophe is EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE?<P>Do you realize how moronic this position is?<P>Regardless of anything else, saying that this woman is emotionally unstable is cruel, insensitive, shows a total lack of understanding of human nature, and betrays a level of self centeredness and egocentrism that makes me VERY sad.<P>Mainly I would say it says the poster is 12 years old that seems to have deluded himself into thinking he has formed a brain already.<P>Correction, I know many twelve year olds with more logical capacity and human understanding than this.<P>To all the hearltess would be knowitalls (if they knew diddly) who say that Managirl should play YOUR way and not get involved emotionally and be a cold ignorant bastard.. TOO BAD. The world will never be the way you want it and neither will EQ. I would rather play with a dozen nice and intelligent Managirls than one of you self righteous morons with no compassion for any one else and faulty logic to boot.<P>To all of you high and mighty RP nazis, get over yourself. EQ is NOT a roleplaying game, and never will be, and never was INTENDED to be. They won't even allow a RP only server! NOT ONE. What does that say about their commitment or interest in RP?<P>EQ is NOT an RP game for all that it has RP in the description.<P>Was Managirl a frivolous name? Perhaps, but people have frivolous names. Did it hurt anyone? MORE IMPORTANTLY was it a violation of the naming policy in the first place? NO. SvartTheNecro has a very good dissection on page two showing this.<P>Kiron, yes I would definitely advise you get hold of the "How to be a man" asap, you clearly need it. The GM should be let go for _arbitrarily_ enforcing the rules. And they are NOT enforced on everyone. I would be happy to point out MANY worse cases that are ignored, except that I will not be a pathetic low minded rat.<P>Yes GM's are the enforcers.. Still I have NEVER had any one do anything useful, like reprimand a KS'er. I had a PC kill me in a bank on RZ with a GM standing right there.. a banning offense.. and he did nothing. But call yourself Managirl and man gotta do something about THAT.<P>And lastly to all the bubblebrains out there who had the presence of "mind" to post to the effect "she broke the rules she deserves what she gets, uh huh, uh huh".. SHE DIDN'T. Read the damned rules before you quack your beak.<P>FK</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Oceanus,<P>    Just curious... are you English ?  Cause you still don't get it.  I live in New Hampshire, and work in Massachusets.  End in any Social talk, if I EVER put the word "Ignorant" representing the lack of knowledge for someone...  They will take it as an insult.  I was born in Montreal, Quebec.  Same thing in French...  People would use the word as an Insult, not a state.  In French I'd say "Tu as aucune Idee"...  compared to "Tu es ignorant"...  Ignorant would get you in a BIG argument, and it will in New Hampshire or Massachuset.  Let's try this in New York or Boston... thinking that it just states that you have a lack of knowledge...  Please come over and try.  Please do that in New York...  But tell us who we should send our Condolences... hehe<P>You're dictionary is stuck up your Butt so far, that you don't understand still... that a word has different meaning in different places.  Our swears in Quebec are of Religeous nature... pretty bad if you think about it.  Go in France, and they think you're talking about religion, or you're religious... pretty funny if you think about it.  Stop making yourself look like you graduated from Harvard, and that you're a know it all...  You still stick to the same opinion... which is way off topic, but similar... how ?<P>Everyone is different.  Everyone reacts different.  Everyone puts different importance to things...  What is Golden to you, is scrap for me... does that mean I should put you down for my belief's ?<P>Back to topic.  This woman used EQ as a hobby, and invested time into it.  Her Identity in this Hobby was changed.  She got hurt by it, and had a crying spell about it.  It's normal for some people to cry when they are hurt.  Not matter if someone else thinks she made a mistake or diserves it.  So much immaturity flared in this thread...  Putting someone you don't know down, like you know better.<P>As for you randonloggin, re-read the main post.  She didn't Argue..  She was shocked and confused.  At the beginning she though it was a joke... No where in there does it say she Argued.  Why make something up ?  You feel threaten in any way ?  This thread as been complicated enough, we don't need to make up anything to prove a point here... hehe<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Randon,<P>I went back, re-read your dissent post and truly I see only 2 points that you are saying were violated.<P>1.  beachbum has all sorts of popular references.  Umm, sure.  That won't float.  They said treehugger was an acceptable surname and I know that it too has been used in popular culture for a long time.<P>2.  Girl is a title.  LOL.  Number 1, if it was a title then shouldn't it precede the actual name (like Girlmana?) and secondly, LOL!  Girl is not a title, it is a gender reference.  I would love to know how you can call it a title and use it in a sentace as a title.  If you can do that (and not make me laugh my arse off) then I will give it to you.<P>And as for your other posts, you must make a wonderful partner in life, for someone who is as shallow and unfeeling as you are coming off.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Reading the naming rules, I do not see how either the first name, the last name, or the combination of names violates any of the stated restrictions.  All of them are obviously off base except the following two:<P>6)Common words and phrases that would not be found in the place and time setting of the game (e.g. Switchblade, Phaser, Toaster, Cannabis, Sloegin).<P>One could argue that Beachbum counts here, but a) that wasn't the name that was changed, and b) she WAS a beachbum and she WAS in that setting, so it doesn't apply.<P>11) Names that contain sentences, phrases, or more than two words. (Ikillorcs, Ontop, and Petcarbob, Diediedie) Descriptive compound words are allowed, especially in surnames (e.g. Treehugger, Giantslayer) <P>Both of these names are, in fact "descriptive compound words" of no "more than 2 words" which "ARE ALLOWED".  Given that they violate none of the other rules, her name shouldn't have been changed at all.<P>If a policeman walked up to you on the street and said "you're wearing white socks on a Tuesday, please hand them over" would you give him your socks or would you ask him what the heck he was talking about?  She deserved an explanation, particularly since, in my reading of the rules, her name was NOT A VIOLATION.<P>And if the normal practice is to give players 1-3 days to change their name, and the guide was tired of talking to her, he SHOULD have said "I'm sorry, those are the rules, you have 1-3 days to select a new name, you can petition if you disagree, goodbye".  He should NOT have just gone ahead and changed the name.  He's a customer service representative, and she's a customer.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

This means that the INTENT of this rule is to disallow PRHASES, not descriptive compound words like "Darkmoon Treehugger" or "Iceheart Gladestalker", etc.  "Managirl Beachbum" are two completely separate descriptive compound words that do not create a sentence or a phrase, and are EXACTLY like the fantasy names that are allowed and promoted, albeit a little light-hearted.<P><BR>POINT 2<BR>_______________________________________________<BR>&gt;5) Non-fantasy names from popular media (e.g. Rambo, Darthvader).<P>-----Hmm nope, unless the GM confused her with rollergirl----- &lt;<P>Oh come on, Beachbum?? all sorts of pop-media References there.<BR>___________________________________________<P>The rules don't state "pop-media REFERENCES"., they state "Non-fantasy NAMES from popular media.

Both of these would be common terms, and associating them together would have been natural.  The use of the term "beach" and "bum" is rampant even throughout the NPCs, so obviously "beachbum" would be an acceptable extension.<P><BR>"Managirl Beachbum" MIGHT be a very light-hearted, fun-loving name, but it does NOT VIOLATE the rules as expressly stated and these people should contact customer service.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Not being an everyday gamer, she does not understand. He tells her to "change it now please" She asks "why, this has been my name for almost a year sir" He does tell her again "I do not make the rules" in 3 minutes, my wifes character is Named Matemp &lt;&lt;<P>Ok, so this line below :<P>"why, this has been my name for almost a year sir" Is considered arguing?<P>What a nasty woman, talking back to the GM like that... ?!?  What the hell is wrong with you man.  Can't someone ask a question or have a Dialog without someone else saying "Shut up, you're arguying"...   You're just trying to prove a point...
