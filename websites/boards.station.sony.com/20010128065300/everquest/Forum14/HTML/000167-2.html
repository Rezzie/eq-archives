</FONT><HR>Well after read most of the post here i feal i must add my 2 cents<P>1) I never under stood why Druid didn't not have a pet, we got a buff spell that only work on pets.<BR>2) As for the main differance between Shamons and us Druid(I have both) Is the ability to wear much better armor, come on i can't tell you how many time i look at banded armor with my druid and just wish that he could wear it. because frankly the all natural armor rule for druid realy bites some time I sure that my druid would have live afew of the time that i have die if he jus had a better AC( High AC= Survivability). And you canmake potions we can't  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> <P><BR>I was over joyed when i fist saw that We druids were finnaly going to get a pet that wil not agro on us after a few mins(that what happen when you charm them, sure they fight for you but when the charm wears off they and the thing you sent the to fight try to kiill you) Which makes the Charm animal line of spells worthless. I would never use them in a real combat as some time i have all i can handle with one monster and twoi would just kill me. <BR>As for the bear Form spell I not seen it so i don't know. but real bears are slow to respond<BR>So i would say.<BR>A str & Sta increase would be in order. But no ground speed increase as bear are slow to react.How ever i would give it a del reduction and some regenerative abilitys. <BR>(I know there are Shamon out there who are going to just hate this) I also feal that we druids should also get this spell, As Shamons and druid are both Nature Clerics. I also feel that Shamons should get The wolf form Spell as well.<P>In closeing i like to say<BR>Don't begruge other classes for getting better. <BR>We are all one big Gaming family and should be happy that are brothers and sisters are get better.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>To all the shamans out there that were worried about Druids getting a pet....well don't!<P>Big deal, anyone that is level 55 will tell ya BIG DEAL - the pet is lvl 30. You think the mobs that you are fighting at that lvl will even notice a little black bear nipping at it's toes...I don't think so. If anything it's a novelty nothing else.<P>So shamans don't worry about it unbalancing our classes it doesn't at all.<P>Now what we should be complaining about (both druids and shamans) is getting Verant to understand we really need a better HEAL!!<P>Nekaou Sneakabout<BR>55 Druid</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree...with the original poster. Eq is abusing the shamans. Druids would get the pet at 55, the same level as our last pet, they will probably be equal. That probably being the case, the druids group wolf form will be terribly unbalancing. We have no stats on our bear Illusion, even if the stats are equal to wolf form ,ours is self only and not for the group, thus we lose out on that. And imagine the druids kiting with the snare and the pet?<P>Druids are becoming way to powerful. They are becoming better healers, they can teleport anywhere, where we can teleport to 2 places at a cost of 1k plat each. Their dots are about equal, they get snare to make them better at kiting then us. They get group sow which we never get, they get group regens which we never get,both groups we got the spells first, how did we end up so behind? they are now getting our debuffers, they get awesome damage shields compared to ours which we only get through alchemy... which costs and takes up inventory slots, their dd spells seem to be better and they get some decent buffs, and to make it worse they seem to be more mana efficent then us. The group heals ,regens and wolf form (stat buffer) certainly are more mana efficent then us casting our equivlient on each group memeber.<P>I'm sure their new spells for vellious are useful, where ours are much weaker versions of other spells to help us with fighting the cold based monsters. Most of our spells sit in the book being useless. <P>We tank better then a druid, but I would not try to make a living as a tanking Shaman, and as an Iksar shaman I do not get to use plate. And add to this we dont' even get to use the shaman places at the other evil cities, because all the evil people not only don't get along with good races, but also don't get along with other evil races.<P>Ok EQ now that you have made the druid equal to the necro, and fixed our fighters abilities. And the Bard is already a god, it is time to fix the Shaman, the abused step child of the everquest world  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Bloodfangz <BR>lvl 36 shaman</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>And to those of you who say , play a druid. I have a druid and my druid does have it all. That is a game inbalance and that is why i am posting. Just like it is crazy for a lvl 27 Bard to be able to take 2 giants and never have to sit down in between, because he charms one and makes it kill the other. When a fighter can't solo one till like 50th level.<P>And in D&D I do remember the druids being the masters of animal forms, but I don't remember them also being the masters of travel. Either way in EQ no one is a master of two realms. And at this point Shamans are not masters of anything. Clerics have awesome buffs, better then mine for keeping a person alive at least, and Druids go figure also have buffs. <P>The issue is not the stupid pet,most shaman have under powered pets that are just "compainions" as eq has explained the pets weakness. The issue is game inbalance, As some posters have pointed out. For us shamans the issue is we are falling way behind druids on healing, and so many other things that it is got to the point where we have to get eq to address our problems. <P>If you give yet another class a pet...lets see, Mage, Enchanter, Bard (charm) , sk, necro, shaman, druid... Oh yeah lets see a wizard could summon an minion and control it, yeah lets give him one, and a fighter could buy a dog as a companion. Lets give everyone a pet. The point is we are all becoming to much alike. The shamans are fighting for our identity and for much needed power upgrades.<P>I would gladly take the power upgrades and drop the pet. He dies as soon as he gets aggroed on and you have to use him like a enchanter pet, very specificly and cautiously. Using a Shaman pet is an art in itself. And like most shaman spells it is incredibly mana ineffcient. When you use up 2/5's of your mana for this companion and he dies fighting the first blue, you begin to wonder about it. <P>Shamans claim to fame was buffing , that was taken away. Then it was the added dots, now clerics have dots, so that was taken away. Our healing is falling way behind because we have no group heals or regens, yet druids do. Now the pet for druids. That was the only thing we had you didn't. Now we are to much alike, yet in the overall scheme you get the golden teleports anywhere and the great faction. Give that up for your pet!!! <P>And for you roleplayers,what happens to a magic type when he loses his familar? He suffers great penalties. Thus it should be for a druid who makes a bear follow him and then has it die in his service! Most shaman are "evil" and so we make the spirits follow our whims. We wouldn't care about it.<P>And if you want to use the D&D rules all characters get followers of some type after certain levels...do we give the fighters bandits as followers? I'm sure most fighters would pay 500 plat for a bandit to help them out, like shaman have to pay about 1k for a teleport to a hostile area. That would be explainable, but now the Druids get to "summon" a pet? The mages should be upset.<P>SO BROTHER SHAMAN REMEMBER THE ISSUE IS GAME BALANCE, NOT THE PETS!!!!<P>I would gladly give the druids pets for better healing spells, better buffs,better mana efficency, and teleports anywhere, which they now have over us.<P>Bloodfangz<BR>36lvl shaman<P>Drewid <BR>20lvl druid</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Please recall that there is more to playing these classes than soloing.  Shaman buffs beat druid buffs any day... the cold hard truth is that if a group already has an evac-er and a healer, then IMO a shaman is going to be preferred over a druid.  Also, the bear pet is only level 30, and to any mob that a druid might be fighting at level 55, a 30 pet is going to do nothing useful.  And finally... the two classes are NOT in competition with each other.  I don't see the need to act like they are.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think those of you who question the capability of a shaman need to review theyre spells,Shaman is tha 2nd best healer there is thanks Topor rocken spell,and even with all of druids 1-60 spells including mana regeneration spells indoors or out,a shaman can go from 0 mana to full mana quicker than a druid,and produce far more damage output with dots,druid dots by no way even compare review Bane of knife or whatever.I know this because as level 60 druid i group with a level 60 Shaman alot,hes continueing to kick out bane topor slow whatever his pet is tanking level 50-53 54 mobs,while im sitting there trying to muster the mana to do one dot,he's doing 75% of the damage per fight and fom within a min or 2 for the next.Btw the druid pet comparable to a level 20-24 necro pet max damage 28 even fully buffed with druids best,level 34 shaman pet will own it.I like playing druid im not trying to make us look bad,but even if our pet was equal to a shaman 55 pet we still could not accomplish what they can grouped or solo.To many of you look at the lower level spells or 55 or under,check out the stuff much higher,theres some serious uberness there for both classes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
