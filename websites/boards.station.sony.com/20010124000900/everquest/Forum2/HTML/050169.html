</FONT><HR>I just want to get these thoughts on the first page, since it always gets lost on page 2, 3, or 4.  Sorry about the additional thread.<P>On the odd chance a verant employee reads this:  <P>The two little spells that you (Abasor) thinks would be nice to let the druids and shaman have are actually the most used and arguably most important spells the cleric has.<P>CH is situational and raid oriented. Remedy and divine light are the bread and butter spells of healing.<P><BR>Alternative:<P>Drop superior heal to level 44 to reduce the fizzle rates.  Then, rather than give shaman and druids better heals, give the DD classes better (read that as far less resistable) nukes, AoEs, mez, and DoTs.<P>You'll still get the same desired end result, IF the desired end result is to kill the mobs before anyone in the party gets killed.   Game balance restored.<P>2nd alternative: Druids and shaman are not joined at the hip.  You *can* improve the shaman class healing without doing it for the druid as well.<P>If you really must, then give shaman alone the added healing power, by way of remedy at 54 divine light at 59.  <P>If you do this in concert with lowering superior heal to 44 for both classes, and implementing the lower resistance to spells as mentioned above, it would be a no lose situation.<P>Why not druids?  Do I hate them?  Only on this issue.  There are simply *too* many of them, and they are *far* too useful to allow that added healing power (other then reduced level for SH).<P>Like it or not, giving better healing to druids as well as shaman, or even only druids, will kill the cleric class.  <P>I don't think the current 45+ clerics will be deleted, but I do think that most smart players sub 45 will put them on the shelf.<P>You can also count on the fact that only the most rank newbie will start one and, in a few months, the level 55+ game will see less then 1 out of 30 people with an active cleric, or cleric primary.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This is just a blatant anti-druid bias.  Giving shaman better healing spells is FAR more likely to decrease the value of the cleric class than giving the same spells to druids will.  Shamanic slow spells make them much better at dealing with incoming damage than druids.  Just because there was a fad where people saw the versatility of the druid as the way to power is no reason to make the class suffer as a whole.  In the late game druids are weak wizards that traded damage dealing for healing/buffing, in order for them to be balanced those heals and buffs have to compensate for the loss of damage output.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>As a druid I'd be happy if my superior heal at level 54 (a level ABOVE where i get it) with 175 specialize in alteration (respecialized ESPECIALLY for the 53 sup heal and ALREADY this high again) did not fizzle like 4 or 5 times out of several heals on one monk I'm grouping with on one mob. Each fizzle is mana loss and like announcing to the entire area:<P>"I AM A DRUID I AM A HALF AXED(censor) HEALER AND YOU ARE SORRY YOU DON'T HAVE A CLERIC BECAUSE NONE WAS AVAILIBLE OF COURSE AND WE ARE SCUM, HA HA ON US!"<P>Actually druids and shamans are joined at the hip for the cause of healing. I mean.. if you made Sup heal fiz less for one you kinda have to for the other since they get it at the same time.<P>As you suggest, having them get it at 44 or whenever should cut down on fizzing by 54 since they've had it for so long. However, I think the fizzle rate at 54 (having had it one level) is still way higher than the fizzle rate of sup heal for a 35 cleric (having had it one level, and that is when clerics get it right?) and the cleric has MUCH lower specialize alteration than my 175.<P>So I don't think they have to make us get sup heal at 44 so much as just make it like other spells we get at 53 that DON'T FIZZ SO MUCH. I think they set it too high or something but no idea how that works. I've heard that it fizzes more than the 59 treeform spell a druid gets which is also alteration even though they've had the sup heal since LEVEL FIFTY THREE.<P>I think you have one thing backwards though. While I understand your suggestion of giving shamans the remedy and divine light, you are not fully thinking through what shaman's and druids roles are.<P>In a fight, my druid often uses superior heal, damage shield, winged death on the critter. I use superior heal if a tank is going down or something then duck if the cleric gets the complete heal off ( and yes, I have saved lives doing this) I've got a lot of manan, in fact I have a freaking truck load of mana to heal or do other stuff with. AC, as a druid, is not my concern. I'd never get it high enough to matter really so my concern is plus mana and wis. I might nuke some too, though I find with tanks this is a waste of mana better used to support them and if my nuking gets aggro then I'm dead and waste time with a res.<P>Conversely, a shaman's concern is ac first and wis/mana second. Why? Cause he is going to get the living stuffing beat out of him. The shaman's role in the battle is VERY different than a druids. He often malosies (sp) (get the beatdown for that) slows (really gets the beatdown for that one) and quickens the tanks. The ones he casts on the mobs are often ressed, so he has to again and again. As I said, he will have NO WHERE NEAR the mana my druid has, HE CAN'T TOUCH IT. But he will also stay alive when something is quad hitting him for 200, which would pretty much have killed me right there.<P>So after the shaman does the malo, slow, quicken, etc bit, guess what the shaman is saying? That is right. OOOM  or near it basically or medding up to do the same bit again. <P>Guess who meanwhile still has mana after laying winged death on a thing 4 times, pack chloring, Superior healing some and such? Thats right, the druid, who has been medding all that time also if doing its job right so its ready for the next fight before the cleric or shaman who expend more mana (or in the shamans case, don't have more)<P>So although i understand you saying the shaman should get those better faster smaller heals, guess who should based upon what I say above? Thats right, the druid. As a druid I am VERY aware of the differences between myself and a shaman since we often interact.<P>Your "far too useful" doesn't really work in this situation since your party is the best off if it has the cleric, shaman AND druid for some circumstances. For example I've been in icewell lately in groups, its a place where a cleric, shaman and druid all all good to have then basically the rest of the people as tanks and a bard of chanter just for mana if any are availible (chanter can only clarity basically there, doing more gets him dead in about .0000004 seconds and he can't mez really anway, plus its almost always single pulls)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>aandaie, again I can't help but agree about the fizzle rate on superior.<P>As to your other points, I understand them but I don't see that they carry.  If the idea is for  improved healing so that another class can take over primary healing when there is no cleric, the shaman (in this case) will not be using all those other weapons.  At least if he's grouped with one of my secondary characters, he'd better not be.<P>Actually one point you made furthers my own argument for not upping druid healing power.  Clerics must also concentrate on AC first and +wis second.  Clerics also don't have the massive incmome potential that group portals produce for druids starting at level 29.  <P>A player has to be *really* desperate to actually want a cleric to use his level 29 revive, a no experience rez, and pay for the service as well.  Or even for the level 39 minor exp restoration.<P>At least the shaman can save up that 1 to 5 plat for casting sow which he gets at 9.  <P>When was the last time you saw someone /shouting to pay for anything a cleric, prior to level 56 reviviscence, can do? Sure, people always /shout "someone please heal me!", but when you do, he's says "thank you!", or "thx", and runs off to fight while the healer sits down to med back up again.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Because of this, no animal will ever attack him unless first attacked by the Druid. They are spellcasters whose focus is all things natural, allowing them to call upon nature for aid. They share some woodland skills with their Ranger brothers.<P><BR>Shaman <P>They are similar to the Cleric, but are more of a tribal witch doctor and are typically found amongst the more primitve races. Their primary focus is largely healing and other Clerical type spells, but they also have a good deal of offensive spells.<P>Sounds like Shamans are supposed to be the Second tier healers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>If players had more abilities to escape a bad situation the game would not lose any challenge yet taking risks would be more encourageable.<P>The reason why it doesnt take challenge out of the game is that running away is a defeat just as death is a defeat. The difference is that you dont end up losing as much time. Time does not equal challenge. You still lose some downtime because of your wasted mana/health, any travel involved, and the time it takes to re-organize. Those 3 things still make the encounter a risk. There will also still be the risk of a hard diffacult to recover from death as these methods need not be 100 percent effective. It just wont happen as often. The current problem is that the odds of death is too high when compounded with the heavy death penalty. The effect would be simuliar to lessening the death penalty while keeping the high odds of dieing. This way you keep the high penalty but lessen the odds. <P>A cleric's healing and ressurrection provides two things that makes them a neccessity to a group. First is the ability to win a riskier encounter with their heals. The second is the ability to recover from defeat with their ressurections. <P>If you give groups without clerics more abilities to escape and recover from a risky encounter without dieing it can help make up for those two cleric strangleholds without giving any clerical abilities away. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I forgot to give an example suggestion. <P>Give wizards and druids more teleporting locations.<P>What this does is decrease recovery time after an evac. If a cleric less group knows it will only take a few minutes to get back to their location after an evac they will be more likely to take a risk. Once they determine the situation is not going well they admit defeat and quickly evac. No challenge is lost because the group is defeated using the same odds of defeat. <P>It also helps players spread out more but that is getting off topic. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The part of the problem that keeps not being addressed here, now that an alternate solution is on the table, is the oft repeated: <P>"what about all the other classes, huh?  Why should clerics be one of the chosen few"<P>Well, I've tried to address that.  That's what people kept talking about, classes being left out and the game suffering becuase only clerics could keep them alive.<P>I like this added perspective.  It takes the "greedy cleric" argument and throws it right back into their collective faces.<P>Okay, we're greedy.  Seems like we're not alone though, doesn't it?<P>My newest sig line:<P>EQ saved by the druids!

</FONT><HR>&gt; CH is situational and raid oriented.<P>Situational?  Slightly.  Raid oriented?  Not at all.  I've had several groups with clerics where I was the main tank and it was most efficient for the cleric to complete heal me... and I'm a RANGER and only level 43.  Resolution (CLR buff), Symbol (CLR buff), Talisman (SHM buff), and reasonably good gear do wonders to ANY melee class for the efficiency of Complete Heal.  Even without Talisman a warrior would have been better off with CH.<P>&gt; Remedy and divine light are the bread and butter spells of healing.<P>Remedy is wonderful for healing casters quickly, or hitting the main tank after you just fizzled complete heal to give you another chance to cast it before the tank dies.  Those are NOT the bread and butter spells of healing in any of the high level groups I've been in.<P>Any time a person with less AC than the main tank in the group is getting hit, you are spending valuable healer mana.  Any time you have to Remedy a caster, you are spending valuable healer mana on someone who shouldn't really be taking hits.  The only way for this not to be true is if the group healing spells (which ONLY clerics get) are efficient enough to make up for the loss, or if everyone in the group has a regen spell so the hp loss doesn't need to be healed.<P>Therefore, if you accept what I've said so far, you must accept that the most efficient heal on a single target with reasonably buffed hit points is Complete Heal.<P>At my level, if a Druid or Shaman had superior healing, they would be ALMOST as good of a healer as a cleric.  Complete Heal and Celestial Healing both put clerics above that point.  Complete Heal only gets better the higher level I get.  Superior healing doesn't get any better (and arguably gets worse as you start having to chaincast it to keep up with the damage your main tank is sustaining).<P>--<BR>Kiatha Kittenpaw<BR>Feir`Dal Ranger<BR>The Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Kiatha_Kittenpaw:<P>See above where I support SH at 44.  Too high?  Clerics get it at 34, should we move it up to 29 for druids and shaman?<P>As to the rest I, as well as the majority of other cleics, have been saying throughout that CH is only sometimes used (yes, some use it all the time, avoid them).  <P>Level 43 ranger.  You have, what?  2500 HP buffed to the teeth?  And I can't heal you with SH or remedy? 560 points per 4.5 second heal on SH.  How about remedy twice for close to 900 points in 6 seconds?<P>CH to give you back 1500 points will take 10 seconds, and I leave everyone else hung out to dry, including you.  In 9 seconds (plus reaction time) I can cast remedy three times and heal over 1300 HPs without locking myself into you and a 10 second cast.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Actually CH gives back 4k hp in post 55 groups....<P>Warrior has 4400 hp by that time.<P>Oh, and you are concerned that clerics will no longer get groups?  You did say 'threatened' implying that your monopoly would be somewhat busted.  The solutions that you are proposeing imply just that.. you are basically wanting the other healing classes to get totally useless spells while hoarding your precious healing spells.<P>Here's a note... you would rather shaman get better healing than a druid?  If you are wanting to maintain your monopoly better do that the other way around, Shaman are already highly desired at high end game.. they can stach a 400 hp buff on top of cleric symbol and slows, this i smuch more useful than what a druid adds.  So if anyone can replace you in a group its a shaman, not a druid.<P>Gell Strongheart <BR>56 Paladin, Drinal Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Gell1:<P>As with almost everyone else, you skip the first part of the post where healers become less needed overall, and jump the the second.  Fine.<P>Shaman more likely to replace me?  Maybe.  Your example is a bit odd though, since the reason you give that the shaman can replace me is that his buff will stack with mine. Did I miss something here?<P>Anyway, shaman can replace me now, but druids can't?  A small victory for clerics.  Druids breed like tribbles.  Shaman are not that much more common then clerics.  <P>If we only have to compete with shaman, we have a shot.  <P>If we have to compete with both shaman and tribbles, errr.... druids, then we're in it up to our waists.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Quandary:<P>Since when was the most important thing in healing "hp healed/sec"?  I was under the impression the most important thing was "hp healed/mana spent".  Perhaps you can inform me what situations you are fighting in where hp/sec is so much more important?<P>I think hp/sec is somewhat important (that's why regen spells aren't enough).  However there is no possible way for a shaman or druid to even come close to a cleric's -efficiency- in a group at high levels, even if you count their efficiency-increasing options (regens, slows).<P>THIS is why people complain about the cleric monopoly.<P>Because when I'm in a group and the cleric leaves and is replaced by a druid or shaman: our downtime is increased SIGNIFICANTLY to the point that we have a hard time maintaining a steady rythym and keeping up with the backspawn in an area.  And I make the best effort I can to group with downtime-reducing classes (Enchanters and Bards in particular).  If the backspawn catches up to us, we evac or die.<P>This problem is only exacerbated in higher level areas in Kunark and Velious.  Once mosters gain more MR/FR/CR, shamans and druids are crippled compared to clerics.  The ability for the druid to shorten the fight via nukes/DoTs becomes less efficient.  The ability for the shaman to reduce damage taken via slows is less efficient.  This equates to using more mana per monster and sometimes to running OOM and evac or train or death.<P>The only resistable spell line clerics use regularily is the Stun line.  This can increase their efficiency significantly on hard-hitting low-hp mobs (like casters).<P>Compare to shaman: Their Talisman buff is inferior to (but stacks with) Symbol.  Their pure AC buffs are inferior to cleric buffs pure AC buffs.  They have no reasonable HP/AC combination buff.  Their regens are extremely efficient but fall behind monster damage by too much at high levels.  Their slows, which would allow them to compete with clerics in efficiency, are resistable--excessively so at high levels.  Nukes and DoTs are resistable and highly inefficient in a group that is built around melee damage, as most high level groups are.  They have no way to stun a caster aside from getting up to melee range and hoping slam lands.<P>Compare to druids: Their HP/AC combination buffs are inferior or comparable to cleric buffs but cost significantly more mana (= downtime).  Nukes and DoTs are resistable and highly inefficient in a group that is built around melee damage, as most high level groups are.  Group regen spells are incredibly efficient but fall too far behind monster damage at high levels.  They have no way to interrupt a caster indoors, and only a slow-casting inefficient nuke line outdoors.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>While I may disagree with some of what Quandary posted. I do understand the point.<P>I posted in druid talk part 3 but no one really listened. I think it was mainly because my post called for some stuff that would help all classes and not just druids.<P>Basically what I asked for was for them to look at fizzle problems across the board. Post 50 fizzle is not just a druid issue. Look at the fizzle rate on divine light.. My goodness it is as bad as SHeal. What they need to do is not only  move Sheal to 44 for druids but lift the 252 skill cap so that all spells post 50 don't have this issue. <P>They need to fix divine light for the clerics while at the same time not give druids another heal, Just move Sheal to 44 where it belongs (count the spells rounds. Druids and Shaman both should have gotten this spell at 39).<P>Honestly I don't think druids or shamen need a new heal after 50. If Sheal didn't fizzle we would be able to be the secondary healer we want to and should be.<P>Like I said fizzles post 50 is a caster issue not just a druid issue, and the 252 cap has to be the main problem. <P>Well thats it for me usually I get flamed for this point of veiw so flame away. I am getting use to it.<P>Rose<P>PS yes I'm a druid..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Although I don't totally agree about not getting another heal beyond 50 (see the official thread part 4 for my post...at least I think, all these threads are running together now!) I will definitely agree about the fizzle issue across the board.  If I'm doing a round of Resist Magic, I usually get an average of 2 fizzles per attempt for each party member.
