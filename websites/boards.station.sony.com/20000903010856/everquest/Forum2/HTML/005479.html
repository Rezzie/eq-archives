</FONT><HR>Last night I had a rude awakening of the overpower of Magicians in Everquest.  Specifically, their pets.<P>I took a 48th level Rogue in FULL plane of hate armor with UBER gear.. I'm talking Runed Bolster Belt, Gem encrested ring, the WORKS. I mean, this is an uber geared Rogue with about 900ac and 1700hp or so! + the Rogue was BUFFED with 49th level Druid buffs and regen!<P>Well, here comes a 51st level magician, that summons an earth pet that is BLUE to this rogue.  So the uber-rogue duels ONLY THE PET - no casting from the magician at all..<P>In less than TEN SECONDS the pet had killed this super geared - super buffed Rogue/tank.  This uber-pet was QUAD hitting for 40-80 with the equivelent of PC haste of something like 70%.  The pet barely never missed, yet the rogue did very little damage to the pet (indicating the pet had THOUSANDS of hp and HIGH ac)<P>So my question is this..<P>If a blue summoned pet can EASILY kill a completely super buffed, super geared, top notch Rogue/Tank character in less than 10 seconds, we have a serious balance issue in the game.<P>What the hell is going on here?  How the hell can a 51st magician summon the equivelent of a level 60 warrior?!? (perhaps even higher)<P>You guys need to test this crap out, and see it to believe it. Go ahead.. Make a 48th level Rogue, equip the rogue with full planes gear, and the best stuff you can find in the game.. Then have a 49th level druid COMPLETELY buff this rogue, including Chloroplast.  Then watch the pet kill this UBER PC in less than 10 seconds.   Try it.. It will make you sick.<P>I'm not jealous. In fact, I may just make a magician after seeing this crap. But seriously, if your gonna nerf, then your definately nerfing the WRONG classes.  At the very least, Melee/Tank classes (Warriors and Rogues) should have a MAJOR power boost/AC boost and HP boost.  Tanks in EQ are WEAK compared to PC pets and mobs.  An uber geared tank has NO HOPE of standing against a crappy green mob. Whats with that?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Take a uber geared (in full cobalt/indo for highest AC/spell combo) and best weapons (like the darkness and boil blood) against the pet. Pet won't hit for over 37 ish cause of the duel, and can't hit over 55ish normally. Rogues aren't toe to toe'ers, they do the best from behind. Without pets mages are weak wizards, really weak wizards.

</FONT><HR>I play a mage and have dueled people before. Verant has previously nerfed pet damage for duels/pvp/etc. When I have my pet (lv 34) attack an NPC he can max out for 34 damage or so. Sometimes dual wield, sometimes double attack. Mage pets with MASTERY staves (found off gods, zone bosses, veeshans peak) at level 49 summons can do in the 60's to NPC's.   During *duels* though, pets do approximately 50% of their normal damage to PC's.  My level 34 pet did about 17 damage a hit to a level 3 caster in an arena. Yes this same pet does 34 to NPC's. 17 to an untwinked level *3* caster.  The level 49 pets completely buffed out shouldn't be doing any more than 30's at MOST to PC's unless I'm quite mistaken. Yes, please, someone at Verant try the test adiiana mentioned. I would love to hear official results. And if it's true and mage pets in *duels* are doing as much damage in as little time as adiiana says, then I suggest you nerf them. That's WAY too much damage to do against PC's in a duel. (Leaving the NPC damage out of this completely)<P><BR>Kareshi Kanojo<BR>37th Season Mage<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>   I while back while in Cazic Thule waitin for a TR group, I decided to work on Disarm on the mages water pet, I found somethin kinda neat out, if I try to disarm the pet while it is in combat, it attacks me, kinda interesting, but as soon as the mob it was fighting dies, it stops attacking me, well the mage made a few comments to be careful or her pet would kill me, I returned with yeah right, its blue.  Well, we dueled, just the con blue water pet, vs Me, a rogue I think I was 27 or 28, doin my best against this pet, I had to have the mage call the pet off, I was at 1/2 bubble of health, the mage pet was at about 70-80% health.  Thats all the proof I needed to know I was bein outdone by a frickin pet and go back to my necro.<P>Taimat Shadowslayer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Umm, I have to agree. Magician pets are highly overpowered. and YES magicians can easily outdamage wizards with their bolts + pet.<P>but the point really is, magician pets seem to  have like 5000hp, 1200ac and permanent haste as the first post put.<P>/comfort the rogue.  if its any condolence to you, I saw a level 52 magician summon an earth pet that quickly dispatched a 56 warrior in almost no time at all. and it should be noted that the magician was not casting any spells, it was pet vs warrior and the warrior was easily killed off.<P>my question would be, how did all this escape verants attention all this time?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Pets are good for what they are intended.  They keep the caster alive so that the puny little guy has time to get his casts off.  However, who would choose a pet over a warrior for group function?  The pet does reasonable amounts of damage, but he can not taunt a mob well enough to convince it that it'd rather attack him than that meaty looking cleric.  <P>Pets are fine the way they are.  Something that allows mages to solo, yet could never replace a tank.  And if you want to duel, either play a necro or a different rpg.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well really, rouges are the worst melee class face to face.  I bet a blue warrior would beat you also and a similar duel.  And that's really what mage pets are.  Warriors that proc a spell now and then.  Though they have lower ac and hp in most cases.<P>Its not exactly fair comparison if you ask me.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well one of the fundamental flaws here is just that image: Summoning this incredibly powerful hunk of rock or fire or whatever to hide behind while you cast.<P>Try not having that thing some time, and a SLIGHT advantage in damage?  Wizards have been pointing this and other problems out since last July and um... Verant doesn't pay a lot of attention.

</FONT><HR>Hey when I saw a magician send his pet into a mid level dungeon and solo 75% of it, then the magician went in and looted. I knew something was wrong.  But when I see tanks dropping like flies in big battles, and pets fighitng on to the bitter end, seemingly with unlimited hitpoints, something is wrong. After reading the posts here i decided to logon my 46th level ranger and have a 49th level magician freind I know summon a pet and run some tests.  Well all I have to say is.. no matter what I did, the pet beat me in no-time at all!!!  snare/bow/blast, melee, you name it, I tried it, and I got owned in a bad way.  so I had a cleric friend come and throw 50th level cleric buffs on me, and I was still owned bad.<P>wtf is going on here?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Also did the pets have a damage shield up? rogues hit a lot and very fast and if u had a FBSS or other haste item you would have realy gotten messed up by a damage shield<P>Last thing STOP CALLING FOR NERFS! magicians have nothing but their pets, no root, no snare, no darkness, no stun.

</FONT><HR>News Flash for those saying Rogues are the worst face to face melee fighters. Just the facts.<P>1) Rogues have the SAME or higher skill caps as warriors. NO other class can say this. (Defense/Offense)<P>2) Rogues can and DO have equivelent AC as warriors, depending on gear/items.<P>3) Rogues can easily outdamage any melee against mobs.<P>4) Rogues do MORE dmg face to face than warriors. When you factor in the extra attack frontal backstab gives you, higher disarm cap, higher dual weild skill and the usual high str rogues have.<P>The only thing rogues lack over warriors in terms of tankability is hitpoints.  However with smart gearing, and good buffing, a rogue is easily as good of a tank as a warrior with up to double the dmg output.  A rogue that loses a duel to a warrior of the same level is a pretty crappy rogue. IMHO<P>But the topic of this message is Magicians being overpowered, NOT about the fact that Rogues can tank DAMN GOOD and are one of the best classes in the game - and the most balanced overall IMHO. (but I do think melee classes(rogue/warrior) need more hp and ac)<P>BTW im a 46th level ranger, and any rogue my level I have dueled has beaten me pretty hard. but magician pets TAKE ME DOWN immediately.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I agree that pets are a bit too powerful at level 50, however since we've reduced their power at least 3 times since release, we're a little apprehensive about doing so further.  Instead we reduced the amount of the gain in power from 50 to 60 for those pets, both magician and necro.  At 60th level, their power is about right where they should be for that level.<P>One thing that I do want to note here is that though the pets are a bit too powerful at 50th, it doesn't create a "balance" issue in the greater sense of the word.  The power of those pets does not invalidate the need for other classes in the group.  For instance, you never see someone ooc, "group looking for tank or mage/necro with pet for Sebilis run".  There's also issues in the game that often make pets more dangerous to have than not.  These issues serve to balance the pets, though they are powerful in one-on-one combat.  Players on the PvP servers will note that their pets do less damage in PvP combat.  This is for the reason just mentioned.<P>-Gordon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>adiiana, first off, the magician pets have been nerfed time and time again. The level 49 pet used to hit for 90's, maybe 11-12 months ago. Now they hit 60's at best, on top of which there's supposedly a pvp nerf on pets.(don't know about the pvp deal, only actually dueled a mage once, killed his 39 pet easily at 40 with no damage shield on it) But why were you basing your post on a face to face duel between a rogue and an earth pet? It's pretty common knowledge that the high level earth pets have over 3k hitpoints, and they quad hit regularly... and rogues aren't really the best tanks.<BR>  Secondly, for the people calling for nerfs, (Grimstaff, Dazzler), mages have nothing without their pets. They do not have root. They do not have snare. They do not have shield skin. They have extremely SLOW casting nukes that do about the SAME amount of damage for MORE MANA than same level wizard nukes. Lol I can't believe somebody actually thought mages would be balanced with no pet, rofl. <P>I'll say it again. Mages NEVER out damage wizards in terms of spells. Our nukes cost MORE mana, and take LONGER to cast. On top of that most of our spells are bolt spells, lol.  Do I think wizards need work? Yes. Is the answer to wizard problems in nerfing Magicians and Necros? No, obviously. Do I think Melee needs work(particularly monks/rangers!)? Yes.  Is the answer to melee problems in nerfing Magicians and Necros? No.<P>Kinowek<BR>43 monk<BR>21 magician<BR>et al.<P>ps. Lokiomega, your first point: monks also have the same or higher caps as rogues.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"><P>pps.

They should be noticeably stronger than any other pets, or just not give pets to other classes.<P>I do have a problem with wizards not likewise having an obvious advantage in their supposed defining trait.<P>Ok, I have to give my opinion of root/snare vs pet though. If our root holds and/or snare slows, what does that buy us? A little time until it breaks, but no dmg to help kill it.<P>A pet for anywhere near a similar purpose would do nothing more than sort of occupy the mob and not hurt it too much. If a pet was designed to offset the absolutely miniscule (if that) practical dmg aspects of a wizard vs magician by serving as a meat wall version of root + a little bit of dmg, then Verant went a wee bit overboard. The real equivalent balance would be to give us a root+DoT or something, but I am just pointing out these things and do not expect nor want that.<P>I still think mag pets should not be nerfed at all, and just fix Rain and AE spells to bring wizards (and other casters who benefit as well) where they should already be, and also serve to differentiate our classes more.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>My main is a Mage, and I would welcome a pet nerf IF we got some versitility in exchange.  Sure Mages can solo, but not as well as Druids AND we lose half of all our experience to our pet (everytime we get a kill, we split the experience with our pet).<P>That being said, what melee class can really compete with a well played caster class?  A Necro can kill you AND take your experience with DoTs.  Druids can kite you, Enchanters can make you so weak you can't walk.<P>The main point is that Mages are just about smack dab in the middle of the caster "Soloability", not as good as Druids or Necros, about the same as Enchanters, Shamen and Wizards (when you factor in experience gained).  Nerf Mages at the risk of getting yourself nerfed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>first off, what lvl 50 monk have you seen with 1700 hp?  And did your earth pet or water pet have a speed buff?  I have seen water pets fully buffed take down a seafury cyclops (yes, the tough ass ones in oot).  Show me a melee (except prolly for a SK/bard that would fear it for an hour straight) that can take a seafury.  A fully buffed lvl 49 earth pet with damage shield and all, I bet will take down a warrior in full cobalt at lvl 60.  At lvl 51 with my monk buffed to around 970ac and 2400hp, and over 1100atk, I got schooled by a level 49 necro pet (with augument death or whatever buff he put on him)  I had barely taken him down below half health.  this is in a toe to toe situation, me vs a necro's pet after a naggy raid.  Saddest part was that fd failed and necro didnt call back the pet in time so I had to wait for a res...  <P>What I think about mages and necros... yes, they are hella overpowered.  I play a necro mostly cause I'm tired of being outdamaged by pets and seeing warriors and pally/sks being outtanked by earth/necro pets.  If you mages/necros dont think your pets are overpowered, do this:  get a warrior with GOOD equip (full indo/cobalt/twig/lamentation/uberweaponofchoice) (find one who likes to die) and a mage eath pet (dmg shield and all).  send each one of them on a full spawn of FG in lguk.  I bet the earth pet will take down at least one mob with him while the warrior will at his best take a mob down to half.  Wizards... I dunno what to think about them... back in the day when root sticked, and ksing was not a bannable offence, I got KSed by half the wizards on my server.  Now that they're one of the weakest classes, I feel for the ones that I'm friends with, but I really enjoy seeing some of them get resisted with 2 roots in a row and dying...<P>Druids...  I dunno much about, just the fact that when some lvl 49 druid complained to me that it takes him 10 mins to solo the dino in oot and a necro can do it in 5....  I thought I wanted to bind his spoiled behind under that dino...  Any clue how big of a dent would a lvl 60 melee put in that dino's health?  my bets are that the dino would be at full hp by the time the melee gets to load his binding point...<P>Melees, get over your pride, I know it's hard to stare at a stupid spell book for 35 levels, but trust me, you're playing evercaster - just do it. <P>Fosters Kegmeister<BR>lvl 52 monk<BR>The Rathe<P>Fostee Bitz<BR>lvl 29 necro<BR>The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I have recently had a lot of experience with grouping with mages.  I was 41 paladin, and yes I know my class is not supposed to be a major damage maker, but I am using a mith 2H sword and have over 200str with buffs from my druid friend.  The mage I group with was using her 49 fire pet, one of the physically weaker pets I might add, this pet was level 40 because it conned even with another friend.  With BIII on it it CONSISTANTLY hit for mid 50's in QUAD attacks against mobs that were blue to red to me.  The pet sometimes got in 5 hits before I got my attack in on the mob.  One of the mobs that was absolutely killing me at 117hps a hit for doubles, we decided to let the pet tank it where I was not attacking because the pets taunt is not as great as a PC near a mob for some reason.  The pet easily took down this red to me mob, losing 33% of its health, and had regenerated back to full within a couple of minutes.  At that point I had to ask myself "Why am I even here in this group?" <P>I say this because the druid can track and pull, the pet can tank the mobs a lot better than me, I am a mana sink becuase if I try to do MY role as a tank I am wasting the druids mana while he dumps a bar of mana on heals on me (increasing down time by several minutes), and the pet far out damages me.  I hit for an average of 50-60 with a max of low 90's at approximately 1/3 the rate of the pet, yet using 90% of the druids mana at the same time.  There is no reason for me to even be in this group at that point. I question why more mage/necros are not preferred because of these pets, maybe they are I haven't been around the really high level areas yet too much. (BTW we had a duel wielding 49 warrior with us at one time, the pet was embarrasing him as well)  <P>I even discussed this with the mage, she agreed that pets were way more powerful than me and offered her consolation, even stating they are too powerful.  <P>I understand that pets are supposed to be strong, but why are they so far above and beyond what a melee character can ever become?<P>Abashi you have stated your are hesitant about lower mage pet power any further.  That is fine with me, I started playing my mage more after I witnessed this.  What I want to ask is why can't melee be revamped to boost us up some?  Comparing melee classes and caster classes (especially pet classes) at higher levels it is not even a comparison.  A mild boost in defense and offense would greatly help a lot of melee concerns in general.  Yes I could just make my mage my primary, but I am a paladin it is what I want to be, I just like playing other classes some of the time to know the abilities of group members better.<P>If you read this Abashi, thanks for your time and if you say it cannot or will not be done, as long as you have a good arguement I will respect that.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>If summoned elementals were the ONLY source of offense from the magician I would have no problem with them.  A magician would still take as much experience as a PC tank would and his pet could never pull or taunt like a tank.<P>But you add attack spells that are virtually the same as wizard's(or better in some cases), and I have a real problem with magicians.  Wizards don't even come close in overall damage(nuke+pet+damage shields).<P>I say bump up pet AC, take down the nuke damage ALOT, and increase the damage shield output.  And for the love of god give mages something to summon besides pets and frickin beer.<P>That's a radical change and although I believe that's how it should be, it'll never happen.  I figured Verant knew better but they went and made the same mistakes again post-50.  Maybe they'll have learned their lesson by the time EQ2 goes into serious development.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005479-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005479-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005479-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=005479&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=005479&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
