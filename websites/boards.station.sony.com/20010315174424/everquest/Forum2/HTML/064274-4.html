</FONT><HR>People look at you! You think anyone in the comany named 'verant' really cares on what you think, want or care about? GROW UP! THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU OR WHAT YOU WANT THEY CARE ABOUT M O N E Y - money flows they are happy, the money will only flow if they have lots of customers, the only way to keep customers is to make things very hard so you will spend time (T I M E) to aquire items, achieve higher level and so on. So that's why it takes months to complete lvl 54, takes days to kill uber mob (assemble group, organise and raid the mob in some remote place). All that done because they know that we want that piece of equipment and they make it so we spend time thus making them more rich ...<BR>You don't want to make them rich on your suffering the choice is obvious - quit. <P>You want to know why ebaying was closed? Because new people who just started playing the game could have access to things they'd not even dream of getting within next couple of months of playing. So verant realised that new players would achieve more levels faster and they just made sure they can't do it. WAY TO GO VERANT - shadowbane rolls to public i will laugh my ... off seing server population on Eq drop to 100people per server levels <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Shadowbane on i'm out keep your loyal customers and umm sheesh you're gonna loose those too ahaha.. sorry about that you're just pathetic verant abashi abzor or whatever names you guys using.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Just a few suggestions I suppose...<P>First, I should make note of the fact that I don't have any of the uber BP's that are being discussed. Obviously take my words with a grain of salt.<P>&lt;clip&gt;<BR>Yeah, we've pretty much agreed all the way around that high HP heal items are a bad idea. These items were in fact created by a guy who plays a high-50s cleric in an 'uberguild' and even he didn't realise the impact. <P>In any case, while I personally agree that 1 minute more or less makes the effect useless, these items are such that there's not really a middle ground. Usually somewhere between 'Overpowered' and 'Useless' there's 'Balanced'. I don't think there is in this case given our current limitations. <BR>&lt;/clip&gt;<P>I'd like to comment on this statement right here. I personally believe that Verant's correct, any item that had any type of substantial heal without any mana consumption or any "charges" pretty much falls under the heading of Overbalanced or Useless, depending on the casting constraints and limitions (or lack there of).<P>Furthermore, the admission that these items were created by a staff member who happens to play a high level cleric in an uberguild is another issue right here. This was a mistake. Hopefully Verant will learn from that. I'm sure that admission was made with a certain amount of internal wincing.<P>So... what to do now? Let's look at cleric in "typical situations" and see what could be done to improve a cleric's utility in those situations. Note... I'm citing "typical situations" here. I'm not going to comment on uber raids or uber kill situations since I don't have a whole lot of experience in that area... By typical, I mean the everyday stuff that a cleric's doing. Groups in Seb, Howling Stones, Hole, etc... normal stuff.<P>Well, I do have a lvl 54 cleric so I'm somewhat familiar with trials that a cleric has to go through during gameplay. In my opinion, the single largest "typical situation" that comes up that limits a cleric's utility to the group is when buffing the group. Symbols are expensive to maintain on the mana (as well as the pocketbook since peridots are used). Shield of Words is an extremely costly spell to cast on the entire group. Basically, what I'm saying is that I find myself in a tight situation when buffs run out and my group is in the midst of a raid or exp camp. You either pause and rest for the minutes it takes to rebuff and med back up, or you go without buffs.<P>So... my suggestion would be to increase the "fun" factor of a cleric or even to simply increase the cleric's utility, why have items that are limited to heal spells? Why not have Naltron's Mark be a right click effect of the bp? The utility of something along this lines is extremely evident with the cleric's epic weapon. CR is much easier. It's a mana-less effect. This item is a truly useful item. Let's take a lesson from this and apply it to the BP's, shall we?<P>Other suggestions may be to have buff spells like Symbol on the BP's that DON'T TAKE A REAGENT. Would something like this truly be overbalancing? Personally I don't think so, useful? Sure... I know clerics who lug around 200+ peridots when they leave town to go adventuring. Sure, I suppose you could say, "So what? It's just inventory space." Or even simply say that the costs involved with buying Peridots is negligable for many players who are always rich in the PP. But seriously... have you never come across a situation where you accidentally ran low on Peridots and had to either borrow more, or start being selective on who to buff?<P>Granted these solutions don't really do much for improving the cleric's utility WHILE killing Trakanon, but hey... when you're prepping for him, that's less prep time since you don't have to med for the buff you're using.<P>I guess my point of this post is to accept Verant's admission that the BP's are overbalancing. Go ahead, flame me, I'm simply saying that VI's going to do something to the BP's. As to deciding what effect to bestow upon the BP's let's give the cleric's in the game a utilitarian effect that they will use more often during "typical gameplay".<P>For all the clerics who are contemplating quitting or who have quit due to the pending nerf, let's see if we can help Verant re-evaluate what's going to be done.<P>Should any feel I'm so totally out of line with this post, I apologize in advance to you. Personally, I feel that something can be worked out here, some other effect can be given to the BP's that will make "typical gameplay" fun once again.<P>I play on the Saryrn server and I have a 55 Ranger as well as a 54 Cleric. Hopefully this gives my thoughts and opinions some credibility.<P>Thanks for taking note of this...<P>Bodhi Stormchaser (55 Outrider of Towers of Elysium)<BR>Kila Kierstaad (54 Vicar of Towers of Elysium)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OK.. I've calmed down.. I also see that you posted that you all are going to rethink the effect on the BP (no 60 cast time please, thats just plain silly).  You ask for some ideas on what could replace the effect.. Lets look at what clerics have been asking for as some possibilities.<P>Options..<BR>Self Invisibility - Improved<P>Mana Regen (just enough to regain mana while standing at the same rate we would sitting, and an effect not spell)<P>Heroic Bond  - Mind yout this could be used as a group heal, so please dont put it on only to realise its a mistake and take it back off.. /sarcasm on IT IS A HEAL /sarcasm off.. ok you got that  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Group version of a AC buff.. Maybe a Group Bulkwark of Faith, heck.. Even single target if cast time is left as spell is<P>Targetd/AoE Stun With Memblur... 1 sec cast time, 4 sec stun Unresistable.. This would help us avoid the new aggro you have introduced and provide us some new functions in the group<P>Krishack<BR>59 Templar - Tribunal<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>How much you wanna bet that over half the people that have made these posts have never even SEEN one of these BPs much less owned one? Sure I don't like my class or other classes loosing power but these uber healing BPs really were unbalanced. My goodness if changing the ITEMS that clerics get from PoG and Vel quests (ie very rare) make the difference in the class beeing absolutly needed and worthless then the item is WAY BEYOND BROKEN, and the class/situation needs fixing. The item is not worthless now. The cleric simply casts the item spell on the tank before he goes into combat. Bingo a mana free 1500 hps of healing at the start of the fight. Its not as good as it was, but if you look at it that way its not bad either. Nice dang stats otherwise anyway. <P>Yes I wish verant had balanced it before they put it in game. Yes, it sucks getting whooped in the head with the nerf stick. YES, if an item so unbalances a game that mobs have to be tuned because of items one class gets, they NEED to be nerfed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Later after reading spoiler sites I found you are required to be L45 to use that specific piece of armor.  WTG brain children.  You need to replace the effect with RESO, as you already nerfed it to be another useless piece.<P>Thank you for the consistant nerfs (enhancements?) to the player base as a whole since I left your game.

</FONT><HR>Ok here goes after seeing some of the posts of how and what to change the PoG Bp effect, I find myself sick to my stomach. I can not believe that the posts I have seen will be used to judge the effects. For the most part these people have no clue of what they are talking about. They are either very low lvl clerics or just plain uninformed. Most would not survive a high lvl encounter nor would their group. If they did they wouldnt be asking to nerf the BP back to Kunark lvl efficeincy during the age of Vellious.<P>I resind my opinion about mana regeneration such as the mana robe. I dont think they deserve it.<P>#1 Please leave the few Bp in the game as they are. Do not alter them 1 bit. Stop them from dropping anymore.<P>#2 These Bp will not have a large impact on clerics as a whole only the ones that have obtained them will have use of them. Because they are no-drop these BPs will stay with the character and leave the game gradually anyways as people find other avenues of entertainment.<BR>The ones that have no clue, can be replaced with the Naltrons Mark or what ever other inferior buff they vote on.<P>#3 Make these BP Vellious only enabled, and put a limit on Level to cast. Say lvl 59 the same level as the spell. People that have obtained these at lower lvls will still value the BP and give them something to play for to higher lvls. You do it with  weapons why not armor with effects. Give people an option of trading them in for new ones or keeping the old ones.This will effectively remove another 50% of the BPs from use at this time.<P>#4 Others seem to be happy with inferior effects, give it to them with the new BP, they will probally never totally understand what is to be high lvl cleric anyways. They deserve what they ask for another nerf.<P>#5 Reward vs Risk lost faction to gain these will remane rewarded. The high end users will remain happy. The low lvl ignorant cleric classes will be happy. They will now have an item that does absolutely didley for them against Uber Mobs. Ever try to invis in battle after agro. Decide to buff your group after Traknon or any boss mob has been pulled.<P>#6 Level 59-60 Clerics will not be raiding in the zones where Mobs hit less than 300 pts per 6 seconds.<P>This is the best solution and easiest to keep the total player base as happy as possible .<P>While I thought mana regeneration might be a possible solution that would help everyone 46-60 levels, the posts reflect that too many are happy with playing there characters at a much lower lvl therefore penalizing the high end Cleric in this game.<P>Get some imput from people that know how to play their class, test it more to see you are making the right decisions before implementing another mistake. Try putting effects into place on equipment that is deserving of lvl. Start rewarding characters that achieve this lvl, not penalizing them because a lvl 46 can use the same item. I know you can do better than what you offering, but just how much effort are you willing to put in to fixing something the right way. Lets keep the game enjoyable to all that are involved.<P>As a closing statement not to forget our Donals holders who have also been nerfed with their fine BP. Do something similar to allow these people the reward they so deserve.<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, there was a call for ideas, so I don't know how the clerics will like this, but it is *an* idea at least. I have noticed that clerics have a fairly nice variety of spells that don't get used much.  When I asked a friend cleric why, he said there aren't enough spell slots to hold all of the required (healing) spells plus all of the interesting utility spells.  As I see it, the BP pre-fix had the following advantages:<BR>does not require mana<BR>does not require spell slot<BR>no recast time requirement<BR>The BP also had a disadvantage:<BR>locked you into a cast for 24 full seconds (a very dangerous eternity for a cleric)<P>So how about using the BP to effectively give one free spell slot?  Keep the effect on the BP the same, but have it cost the mana (the normal amount), and use the normal spell cast time (not the absurd 24 seconds, and certainly not the ludicrous 1min)<BR>This would eliminate the disadvantage the BP used to have, and would only leave one advantage (does not require a spell slot) - certainly not unbalancing, and just as certainly more useful than a 1min casting time spell.<BR>If this seems like it is not powerful enough for the BP, it could be set up to require slightly less mana or slightly less casting time.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Please just consider alternative spells rather than lengthening the casting time.  I think what bothers me most about the changes to the BP's is that it is almost as if the designers don't know what spells clerics load.  Just in case you're wondering...I load healing spells.  Why is it that we can only have healing effects on our items as long as they aren't used in some beneficial manner?  <P>A one minute casting time is a joke.  Sadly, I'll never have a reason to use the bp's effects again.  I can probably meditate a CH back in 60 seconds.  As it is I'm annoyed with the 20 seconds I stand there.  Please choose another effect.  <P>How about DA to go with the other "enhancements" to healing that you have bestowed upon us recently?  Some kind of Shielding?  Invisibility?  Aegolism (wouldn't mind standing there a minute for something useful)?  Aegis?  Stun command?  Mark of Karn?  Manaskin? Abscond? Harvest?<P>Anyway, please just think about a new effect not this nerfed version.<P>I'd like to think that you would consider your customers as much as the "game's balance"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>/target Absor<BR>/bonk<P>Alan, Alan, Alan...  Sigh.<P>I'm glad to see that you took the advice I gave in a recent post about the necessity of discussing this topic further with the players (or coincidentally popped in here to do it without having even seen my post), but it's too bad you didn't see/heed the other advice in the same post, concerning the need to consider Customer Relations ahead of whatever "game balance" theories are floating around the Live Team chamber.<P>If you had, you might have realized how your recent post would sound when dropped into the angry mob that has gathered in the wake of the recent nerf announcement.<P>Allow me to explain how your comments are going to be taken by a lot of folks here, and (IMNSHO) not unfairly either (given the current context).  I'm not saying that this is necessarily my belief of how you DO mean your comments (and it's not how you meant it I'd suggest that you come back soon to try to clarify), just how they can reasonably be perceived in the current climate:<P># [Absor wrote:] Well, it's the combination<BR># that matters. It's not just 300 hit<BR># points every 6 seconds; it's 300 hit<BR># points every 6 seconds, lasts forever<BR># and starts even before the fight starts,<BR># with almost no chance that the cleric<BR># will be attacked for doing it and at<BR># no mana cost.<P>This isn't an explanation, it's a description.<P>It begs the question, "yeah, so?"  Exactly WHY is this an unacceptably high amount of capability for a high-level Cleric when casting on a high-level groupmate?<P>Exactly which mobs would this make killable that Ought Not Be Killed by a 50+ Cleric and a 50+ tank?  I can't think of any, and neither can anyone else who has weighed in on these threads.  As others have pointed out, 300HP/tick represents a high-green/low-blue mob at 50+.  So what's the Terrible Imbalance here, that would result in The Ruin Of The Game?<P>If it's just the Live Team's personal feeling that "people shouldn't be able to do that", is that truly a good enough reason to cause this sort of uproar?<P>If it's the jealousy of people who can't do it because they haven't bothered to make the effort to get their own BP (or help a friend's Cleric get it), is *THAT* a good enough reason?<P>What is it?  Really?  What will be "broken" if this item remains as is?<P><BR># I can't do much more than that, explain to<BR># you why we feel the item is overpowered.<P>This sounds suspicously like, "I can't really explain it, because we don't have a reason clear enough to spell out, other than to list the effect of the spell and simply declare it Too Much".<P>If 300HP/Tick is "Too High", then perhaps you might want to explain WHY it is too high.  What Not To Be Killed Mob does it topple, what player fun does it ruin, what Philosophical Part Of The Vision(tm) does it blast into smithereens?  If any?<P>The players would like an actual *explanation* of why this ability would allegedly do bad things to the game, not a recitation of the spell effects followed by a repetition of Verant's standard "so you see how awful that is and why we had to remove the item, why are you gathering your pitchforks?" speech.<P>Such explanations wouldn't be necessary if you were simply rejecting suggestions to put such an item INTO the game.  But since Verant itslef put it into the game, and players devoted an awful lot of their time/effort/exp-loss/faction-loss to get it, THEN it seems only fair that Verant should explain AS WELL AS THEY CAN why they are choosing to flush the fruits of that labor down the drain.<P><BR># We've decided to talk more about what <BR># effect to put on the new breastplate, <BR># and exactly how to make this change. <BR>#<BR># With the next patch we will still be <BR># changing the Celestial Elixer effect <BR># (or perhaps removing it entirely) from <BR># existing and future breastplates. But <BR># we are still debating what effect to <BR># put on the item, and I'd like to hear <BR># your ideas.<P>This is going to be received as "even before we know what we're doing, we're perfectly willing to dive into it headfirst anyway, or at least take away current capability and then sit around for an indeterminate amount of time before we decide what, if anything, to give back".<P>Or even "we have no idea how much healing on an item is Just Right, but we sure know how much is more than that amount".<P>Until you decide what to do with the item, why not leave it as it is?  Constant changes only cause hard feelings, especially when you're leaving an indeterminate period in the middle where things are far worse than before.<P><BR># Please, give me your ideas. But, also, <BR># please try to do so in a civilized fashion.<P>Alan, as you have probably noticed, a lot of people are getting to the point (some have already gone beyond it) where they value the ability to tell Verant exactly what they think of the recent game changes (posting rules be, um, danged) more than they value their ability to continue to play the game that they see as being continually undermined by recent changes.<P><BR># I understand that it appears that we <BR># are 'attacking' clerics, with three <BR># recent changes that directly affect<BR># gameplay for the highest level clerics. <BR># That is certainly not our intent.<P>So why do it?  What part of the game would have whithered up and died if you had decided to just leave things as they were, or tweaked them a lot more gently than you have?  What was so necessary about these changes that you knowingly wreaked havoc in the morale of the players by yanking so many rugs out from under them so quickly in succession?<P>In short, where do your priorities actually lie?  Do they lie with whatever armchair ideas you have about Game Philosophy, or with the people who are actually paying you money to (try to) have fun in the world you've created?<P>As time goes by, "You're In Our World Now" sounds less like a welcome, and more like an ominous chortle.<P>If you haven't read the classic "Mudwimping" essay recently, please read it again.  It describes in great detail the death spiral that a game enters when the developers care more about enforcing their philosophy of How The Game Ought To Be, rather than paying primary attention to player satisfaction.  Don't get me wrong, I know that you believe your game philosophy will lead to player satisfaction -- but surely you must try to realize that when the players stand up and almost unanimously express outrage, then something might be a little awry in your philosophy if it causes all hell to break loose.<P>Here's a short passage from the Mudwimping essay, under the "Death Spiral" section -- and remember that this was written long before Everquest.  It's frightening how accurately it describes the past few months:<P>## As time goes by pressures of all kinds, <BR>## from the external player complaints <BR>## about other classes to Imms [game designers'] <BR>## own air-headed want to relegate players <BR>## to a pre-structured jail cell of how the <BR>## Imms expected people to play or level <BR>## becomes much more important than <BR>## player happiness and more and more things<BR>## are slated to be wimped; weapons, gold, <BR>## good-solid established skills or <BR>## spells.. nothing is safe, nothing is sacred.<BR>##<BR>## Within the players, this produces a natural,<BR>## rational, and predictable reaction. What <BR>## they counted on today may not be there<BR>## tomorrow. These gods that were so kind <BR>## and helpful before have now become <BR>## the adversaries, seen as tyrants or  <BR>## people not to be trusted because they <BR>## have betrayed the implied and implicit <BR>## trust that the players gave them when <BR>## they decided to invest their personal <BR>## time and play the mud on a regular<BR>## basis.<P>Sigh.  George Santayana was right.<P><BR># [Absor wrote:] The changes to these healing items are <BR># being made in quick succession due to <BR># the simple fact that we have reevaluated <BR># the idea of healing powers given to <BR># items, and for no other reason.<P>But WHY have you chosen to suddenly "reevaluate the idea of healing powers given to items"?  What required this re-evaluation?  Why was a re-evaluation necessary?  What would have been broken if you had left it alone, what did you "fix" by making these changes?<P>People were having FUN with these healing items.  What re-evaluation process takes precedence over that?<P>Please be honest and open with us for a change.  We know that the reasons given to date are not the "real" and complete reasons, because they make little sense by themselves.<P>Some suspect that the reason is that Verant fears that with these items, people could level up faster, and therefore reach the pinnacle and possibly cancel their subcriptions earlier than Verant would like.  If so, this is not a good reason -- not only do people at the high levels most often turn around and just start twinks of another class if they still find the game fun, but the attempt to put the brakes on players will have the opposite effect, as people begin to (rightly) understand that Verant is making the game harder and harder (and less and less fun) simply for the sake of their own benefit and not that of the players.  This quickly causes people to bail out due to the futility, as you've already seen start to happen.  It also causes people who otherwise would have been satisfied customers (or even satisfied ex-customers) to start warning others away from the game instead of encouraging them to start.<P>If, instead, it's actually being done to try to reduce class envy posts, surely you folks realize that catering to such whiners (not to be confused with people who bring up legitimate balance issues) will only make EVERYONE unhappy.<P><BR># Cassie_Unforgiven wrote:<BR># "I would love to see an official post <BR># from VI stating they will do exchanges <BR># and/or reset faction."<BR>#<BR># [Absor replied:]<BR># I can address the faction issue. There <BR># were/are alternate ways to get those <BR># items. The faction loss was a choice <BR># the player made to get the item one<BR># way rather than the other. We won't be <BR># changing any factions over this.<P>My god (Brell, that is)...<P>Alan, forgive me for saying so, but I find this comment to be either remarkably obtuse, or remarkably callous.  Perhaps both.  And juding from the responses it has gotten so far, I'm hardly the only one.<P>Alan, do we REALLY need to point out to you that while, as you correctly point out, "the faction loss was a choice the player made to get the item",  the fact remains that the players made that choice IN ORDER TO GET THE ITEM AS IT WAS AT THE TIME.<P>By suddenly changing the items they have AFTER they have already knowingly "paid the price" for it, you have done a classic "bait and switch", a practice widely condemned by all fair-minded people as a con job.<P>If you don't want to fix their factions because it would be too much CS work, or too open to abuse, then say so, but it's a slap in the face (yeah, I said it -- a slap in the face) to just shrug your shoulders and say "we're not going to do it because people chose to screw their factions for a reward that we decided to greatly devalue after the fact."  For PETE'S SAKE, Alan.<P>This is like selling someone a year's membership to a health club, then removing most of the exercise equipment and replacing it with an exercise bike.  When the customer yells, they say, "no, we won't give the money back, the money loss was a choice the customer made to get the membership".<P>THIS is the very sort of attitude that has led so many people to start saying, "it's not worth it, we can no longer trust that the effort we put into this game now will continue to be rewarded or even appreciated -- in fact, even after we have achieved something at some cost in time/faction/frustration/pp/whatever, we can't even be sure that an item in-hand won't be yanked away from us or hugely devalued".<P>I quote again from the Mudwimping essay:<P>##  Within the players, this produces a <BR>## natural, rational, and predictable<BR>## reaction. What they counted on today <BR>## may not be there tomorrow. <P><BR># [Absor wrote:] Exchanges (or perhaps just changing <BR># all existing instances of these items) <BR># are something that we are reevaluating.<P>...but don't count on it...<P>This sounds a great deal like, "we had already decided to just nerf this to a worthless one-minute casting time and call it a day and tell people to live with it, but the recent posts (and cancellations) have driven us to schedule a future meeting where we'll see if we can put as much thought into this process as we ought to have put into it in the first place".<P>Again, Alan, I'm not trying to put words in your mouth (and again, please clarify if the impression you're giving is not the same as what your meaning might be) -- I'm just showing how your sketchy post might well be fanning the flames instead of dousing them.<P>I don't think anyone at Verant realizes how much damage has been done to player morale in recent weeks.<P>This situation calls for a lot more dialog, and a lot more information, than has currently been offerred.  And the long string of "we're not sure yets" (not just on this topic, but on almost every nerf riot) doesn't do much to quell the frustration.  If anything, it only reinforces it.<P><BR># When we've come to a decision on what<BR># the replacement effect will be, we'll <BR># then decide about how to deal with<BR># existing items.<P>Until then, everyone is cordially invited to remain dangling -- which is the very sort of "god knows what will happen, but we bet it won't end in rejoicing" uncertainty that has so many people throwing up their hands already.<P>Sigh.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The explanation for this berf from Abashi is flat out BS. A lot of talk, but not a single proven example of how supposedly overpowered the current BP effect is. There is nothing in this game that a group could kill using this breastplate that they couldn't kill just as easily using mana heals.<P>I challeng someone at Verant to actually try to prove that this breasplate is overpowered. Try to find a mob that does less than 300 dmg in 6 seconds that you can't beat without this breastplate. You will not be able to find one because the reason for this nerf given by Verant is a flat out lie and makes no sense whatsoever. That would prove that this breastplate is nothing more than a convenience and not the game-breaking item they claim it is. I'd really like to hear a response beacause I, and many other people are not buying Verant's bogus explanation. Of course they will conveniently skip this reply. =P<P>If the breastplate is given the effect of ageolism or group symbol it will just be nerfed a couple of weeks down the line. These can work both as buffs and good free heals in one. If Verant has learned anything then you won't see any effect like this on the BP. Of course, you can never expect Verant to learn so this effect may very well be put on the BP, hehe.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Copied from another post:<P>There is a serious flaw in the game mechanics of EverQuest. As Verant attempts to scale up higher level encounters to give its best players a challenge, this flaw creates a giant divide in the desirability of classes and of people. This flaw throws the balance of the entire game to one side, forcing the entire tuning of areas and monsters, both big and small, around the new equilibrium.<P>The flaw, simply stated, is this.<P>Melee effectiveness increases with new equipment. Caster effectiveness does not.<P>Chew on this for a bit. You will slowly come to realize that the implications of this are staggering.<P>Under the current model of item acquisition in EverQuest, all casters can do is increase their mana pool. The mana pool is a reservoir. It has no bearing on often you can deal damage, or how quickly you do it. Melee, meanwhile, are increasing their damage every day by real and significant percentages simply by obtaining better weapons.<P>An example? Back in the first days when Fear opened, ykesha's were the hottest swords around. These were 8/28 ratio weapons.<P>Now take a look at the situation 1.5 years later. Almost every melee has something equivalent to a jade mace, a 9/18 ratio weapon.<P>Essentially, every melee class has been able to increase their rate of damage output by nearly 100%.<P>Now take a look at the caster situation. <P>1.5 years ago, a caster had 200 int.<P>Today, a caster has 200 int, and some extra mana items, and perhaps some extra ac or resist items on since the soft cap on wis/int prevents any benefit from going past the limit. Their mana pool grows bigger and they acquire slightly more efficient spells as they level up, but keep in mind melee classes also receive their bonuses to damage and defense, as well as<BR>new disciplines, when they level as well.<P>When all is said and done, casters are essentially at the same place, casting the same spells, that they were 1.5 years ago.<P>So here you are, with melee class effectiveness having been nearly doubled, while a caster is still casting the same spells and doing the same damage that he always has. And you wonder why casters can't get a group? Furthermore, all any melee has to do to improve his damage or efficiency even more is to get new weapons. What are you, as a caster, going to do? Get that +15 int eyepatch you've been lusting after? Oh wait, you're already at the soft cap. And besides that, all it could possibly do would be increase your mana reserves...which has absolutely nothing to do with how fast or how often you can do damage.<P>The downward spiral continues from here. As melee increase in effectiveness, the best groups, naturally, are formed from melee classes. The difficulty of most situations comes to be balanced around these classes, shutting out casters from groups because their efficiency is terrible relative to melee classes and has no chance of ever increasing. Furthermore, as Verant tries to create more challenging encounters, the only possible means of doing so is to provide melee classes with better weapons and armor and balance encounters around these factors, since these are the only factors which are capable of scaling under the current system. Thus, classes which support the melee classes such as the enchanter, cleric, and shaman rise to prominence.<P>Of course, by now, you're asking the obvious question. Where is the magical wristband that increases the damage output of all your fire spells by 20%? Where is the tome which reduces the wizard's casting time by 15%? Where is the staff that reduces the mana cost of your spell by 30%? <P>I don't have that answer for you. How such a fundamental omission could have been made in this game is beyond me. I have constantly suggested the addition of more innovative and creative caster items that were essentially the caster equivalent of a melee's haste item or new weapon. And truthfully, these items really wouldn't be innovative at all...they would have been the natural result of any logical thinking on a designer's part.<P>If EverQuest is to survive, casters must be able to significantly increase their damage output, speed, and effectiveness at the same rate as melee classes. The fundamental gap between melee and casting classes, where casters are left unable to progress while melee classes are rewarded constantly with newer and better ratio weapons, will destroy the game. Under the current system, each new expansion will bring melee classes new and better items, while caster classes stagnate with their virtually useless wis/int items.<P>If you play at the high level game, you will be realizing that we have already travelled down this path to some extent. Your casters are complaining how useless they are in experience groups as well as uber mob fights. Your guild is shifting its emphasis to require more healers and more warriors and rogues. Maybe you been observing these things in action, and agreed with them, but didn't really understand the underlying cause.<P>Now you do. Melee classes and the healing and buffing classes which support them will grow to become more dominant. Kunark made melee classes 100% more effective in dealing damage. With SoV we may see that number grow to 150%. Your casters, meanwhile, have improved by virtually nothing. Each expansion will widen the gulf between melee and caster classes until caster classes are rendered completely irrelevant. That is, unless the ability for casters to improve themselves constantly through the acquisition of unique dropped spells or items is addressed.<P>The way to fix this is clear. Yes, it will require a major overhaul of the way caster incentives and progressions are designed in EverQuest. But it is absolutely critical to the survivability of this game. Can Verant save EverQuest in time?<P>By Heihachi [Povar] Submited on 3/5/2001 <P>Heihachi's points are all true and doesn't even address the further imbalance of CHEAL which is level 39 spell costing 400 mana which is now healing enormous amounts of hp's for a very small amount of mana.Cant get any better than complete.<BR> And clerics cry because shamans and druids get superior heal what a joke.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well firstly, a warrior and cleric combo is no longer the most desirable combo in the game (you can again thank Verant for this).<P>It's cleric and monk.  I play with a 59 monk or a 54 monk and the two of us duo lava duct crawlers, or imp protectors / lava guardians in Sol B all the time, racking up insane experience at these levels with a zero danger level, and we do it far faster than a 60 warrior / 60 cleric combo.<P>Am I pissed about the breastplate nerf?  Only because I wanted one and now it's worthless.  Will I suck it up and move on?  Sure I will.  I still have mana, I still have Complete Healing and tons of hp buffs, and that's all I need to enjoy myself.<P>However, I truly hope Verant continues nerfing and nerfing.  It's my honest desire that they piss off (are you hearing me Brad?) everyone they can.  It just means things will get better when everyone leaves EverQuest for Ultima Online 2, or ShadowBane, or Horizons, or DAOC, or whatever new games are released.  It also means that once Verant's revenue takes a dive into the black abyss of hateful players (after all, money talks, and bs walks), Verant will do one of three things:<P>1.  Belly up like OSI did and start giving people what they want so Miles can keep his porsche outfitted with the latest performance upgrades (I love yah Miles, not pickin' on yah  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">)<BR>2.  Ride out The Vision(TM) all the way until the bitter end of the unemployment line.<BR>3.  Count on Star Wars: Galaxies to save them.<P>Either way, I win, and you lose Verant.  No matter what choice you make, I will win.  You choose 1, I become happy again because I get my power back.  You choose 2, I become happy because you screwed yourself and I got the last laugh.  You choose 3... and we see what happens from there, but you can bet LucasArts is going to be watching you like a hawk for every little slip up you might make.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
