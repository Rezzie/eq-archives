</FONT><HR>Excellent post Muktuk, and your exageration is only slight.<P>I see lots of great ideas for wizards.  I still see no balance issues.  My wizard is fun.  He is very narrow.  And this weekend we will hit Kael, and given the choice between an almost 51 druid and a just-barely 52 wizzie, a VERY serious attack leader wants the big blaster, not the healer/nuker/snaremonkey/althatdruidstuff guy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Muktuk - I really can appreciate your objectivity with the Wizard class.<P>I think that most people here agree that to some degree, the wizard class is fundamentally flawed. After brief descriptions of the flaws, sometimes people follow up with a few suggestions. Some people have interesting and creative suggestions, some people do not.<P>However, unlike you, I don't think the less palatable suggestions will ruin the merits of some of the better ones. And I think everyone should have their say so whether its ridiculous or not. In fact, I think that this catch-22 debacle Verant has created with so-called ‘Wizard Balance’ warrants ridiculous suggestions if only for the sake that those players be able to vent the frustrations realized from two years of being ignored.<P>I'm beginning to get the feeling that people, through hyperbole, are trying to get their point across by perhaps over-emphasizing a balance issue just to be sure that the point is made. And I have to agree with this approach, especially when the resulting official feedback consistently focuses on things like, the shock of fire spell graphically looks like an ice spell grrrrrr!!<P>Anyway, I don’t think Verant needs any help erring on the side of Wizards being underbalanced, so hats off to those trying to make their point, however they can get it across.<P>… Now, haven’t I told you a billion times not to exaggerate?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

This is all nit-picky stuff about minor effects and bugs and such "<P>Please take the time to read ALL 6 parts of this thread and state why you conclude you see "little if anything to do with balance related issues" as you decided in part 2 of this thread.'&lt;<P>Please, stop taking my comments out of context and getting all angry about them.  Please read the entire post before getting critical about what I said.  And I wrote that in the post that I made to start the thread, not in part 2.  And I was talking only about the meager list that I had made before starting the thread, not player suggestions.  If you really want me to read what you've written, please do me the same favor.  You do all of our customers a disservice by misrepresenting my posts that way.<P>Mcdermit wrote:<P>&gt;"Absor, thanks for listening. There's an unbelieveable number of posts stacking up in all the class talks, and many of them are repetetive. I commend you for taking the time to read them."&lt;<P>This far down the thread, I'm mostly just skimming.<P>&gt;"Hey, how about we stop flaming Absor for his "nit-picky" remark? He said that in reference to his own list of issues, before any of us even posted. <BR>Also, go re-read his summary at<BR>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050989-5.html <BR>He covered all my big concerns, and any posts we continue to make at this point really should bring up issues he doesn't already have on his list."&lt;<P>Thanks.  At this point I'm reading looking for refinements and such.  I'll post a more finalized list when I get done with the other five classes (FIVE MORE!  Goodness…).  With all this reading, I can't spend a lot of time cutting and pasting  and commenting.  Thank you for understanding that.  I admit to getting a little frustrated spending an entire day reading hundreds of posts and getting to ones that say things like "Why do we bother, Absor doesn't care anyhow.  Nothing will change."<P>We all care.  You should see the e-mail flying around the office.  A lot of the team is also reading these threads.  Ideas are being churned as I type.  You guys just need to have a little faith and give us some time to get this all worked out.<P>&gt;"How long before Absor responds again? <BR>Or is just going to think up some opinions and stick with them?"&lt;<P>See what I mean?<P>I have a little challenge for you nay-sayers.  Read EVERY post in EVERY class talk thread.  Mail me a COMPLETE summary of the thoughts of the players (in your own words, include arguments both for and against each subject).  I'm no hero for doing it, but I'm not exactly taking long coffee breaks and making paper airplanes.  That was my old job…<P>Ninaeve wrote:<P>&gt;"3) Epics should be hard, but one class's should not be obviously harder than others."&lt;<P>Well, because I'm getting into a snippy mood reading this thread…<P>Yes, one class does have to have the hardest epic quest.  That's just the way things go, they can't all be exactly equal in difficulty.  And, well, wizards do not have the hardest epic quest anyhow…   ppthththththth!<P>*sigh*<P>Sorry, I had to get that out.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Come yell at me if you're in Baltimore this weekend, folks.

</FONT><HR>Absor - <BR>Make me *more* wanted in groups. However you accomplish that, I don't care. I want groups to want me as much as I want to be in a group.<P>Last night, at L40, was the very first time since probably L16 or so that I actually received a private tell to join a group. I was astonished.<P>Killing that feel-good feeling was becoming aware of the fact that there was hardly anyone in the zone and groups were bascially starved for more members - any members, even a wizard.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"Maybe I exaggerated... but there have been more than one poster suggesting that to balance the wizard class, they need to meditate twice as fast and have all their blasts do twice as much. This is an excellent way to ensure that the good suggestions are written off."<P>Personally I have never suggested that.  I have suggested a 15% DD increase across the board or a 15% increase in mana recovery or both.<P>Alluding to your earlier post, yes a well played wizard knows when to nuke when not to nuke.  Often I nuke usually twice on a mob sometimes more if I want to save the tank to pull aggro on me for a few seconds while the cleric heals him.<P>I can also chain nuke below 50% to kill the mob semi-fast on an overpull. <P>All in all you need to get a feel for the group to decide what and when to cast.  The mark of a great wizard.<P>The point that alot of the higher wizards (and I'm not high btw only 43 1/2) is that they are often overlooked because other classes have COMPARABLE and sometimes SUPERIOR DD spells to offer to the group while also offering other group friendly components (pets, heals, buffs, mod rods, etc)<P>I personally don't advocate group friendly buffs for the class.  I prefer to stick to the "one pony" trick approach to our class which is massive DD in a short period of time.<P>However in many levels our DDs are sometimes less than these other classes that also offer group friendly spells and so the veteran players which makes up most of the EQ playerbase will overlook a wizard for another person.<P>The root of the problem for our class is really 75% perception of other players and 25% actually class design flaws.<P>Perhaps if they did increase our damage mana and also give a display of what we hit a mob with we can convince other players of usefulness.<P>And again I would point out I have no problem finding a group, but my fellow wizzies do.  That concerns me.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I have some ideas about wizards that may balance them out to what they are supposed to be as Verant has told us.<P>First of all as many of us have vocalized, wizards are supposed to be the masters of fast damage output.  The problem is our limitations.<P>Rogues would be the equivalent of a melee wizard(sort of).  They're backstabs can do upwards of 400dmg and they are very fast putting in a lot of damage per minute.<P>Wizards cannot keep up with their damage in speed or amount.  I can't even keep up with a monk which is secondary damage-wise to a rogue.  A 55 monk with rbg and his epic can do somewhere around the lines of 5k points of damage.  A 55 wizard like myself can do about the same in the same amount if time if we were kiting the mob and used about 80% of our mana. This isn't even taking resists into consideration.<P>In a group situation, a wizard is expendable.  We are there for one reason, evacs.  If a druid is present, they would throw us right out the window for some real damage.<P>My possible thoughts on fixing wizards(making them more of what Verant thinks we should be):<P>1. This might get complicated so hang with me.  If a wizard uses the correct type of nuke(fire,cold...) against a mob that is weak against that type, then there could be a small chance for a critical hit type of thing. It would do say 50% more damage or something along those lines.<P>2. Give the wizards some type of focus items or focus discipline even...Like we could do /focus fire and focus all our energies into dealing fire damage like for 10 seconds and so the next fire nuke we would cast would be much less likely to resist and a slight chance of doing extra damage. Maybe we could focus at the expense of like 1 mana per tick so that we could focus at any time, but it would cost us a little.<BR>I like the discipline/skill idea with a like 2 minute refresh personally that we could get at like 51, but it could also be done with different types of items kind of like the mage focus items.<P>Either of these things would make the wizard a more viable group member.  We would be doing damage quickly.  Just my 2 copper.<P>But please fix us somehow  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ravenhoth: Point taken.  I dunno... over the past week, when I was stuck in Hate for a couple of days as a shaman, and hence playing the wizard more than I have recently, I stumbled into some periods where I just had the "zen of wizardry" down.  I was finally understanding when to med, when to unload, and when to do something in between, and kept finding that other wizards I was grouping with hadn't figured out how to ration their power.<P>Hence, I get frustrated with what I consider overblown requests, for the same reason that I get frustrated when some shaman says he can't be a primary healer past 35, which is completely untrue.  Just because something's hard doesn't mean it's broken.  Similarly, knowing I was fulfilling my role as a wizard pretty darn well at 34, after being told that wizards "suck" until at least 44 made me think that it was another issue of player problems (much like rangers complaining about their ability to get into a group, after spending months telling everyone their class sucked and shouldn't be grouped with) rather than class problems.<P>But more discussion is better than less discussion, so I will terminate that particular gripe =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Narciss_: Try having the tanks taunt the extras beforehand, wait a little longer before casting, stand further away, and just be ready to root-park anything that runs for you.  I've had better success with AEs than I ever thought likely, given how dangerous I'd always been told they were.<P>That said, there are some dungeons I just don't bother with them in except in case of extreme emergencies.  Lizards in CT seem to have a very short attention span, and rarely fail to mob me after an AE.  Maybe it's a hallucination, but different types of mobs SEEM to react differently to AEs.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Muktuk - I know what you mean when you say you seem to 'get in the zone' so to speak playing your wiz. Your stuns start actually working, letting the enchanter get their mez off. Your nukes land just right so the mob runs or dies. There are those moments us wizzies have. And those moments come by learning to use what you've got, and using those things at the right place and at the right time, which takes skill and strategy.<P>But, if any one single thing has emerged throughout all these posts, it really isn't about any of that.<P>The one thing that sticks out, at least to me, from all these posts, is this:<P>Wizards are not much wanted in groups, especially at higher levels when it becomes more essential for a wizard to group.<P>So, the goal needs to be making wizards more desireable in groups, for reasons above and beyond what we can currently accomplish.<P>That needs to be the goal, however they decide to pull it off, I don't really care - as long as it's effective. I just want to be wanted more in groups.<P>I also play a druid. Aside from the ability differences between a druid and a wizard, one thing that is amazingly differnt is my in-game experiences with others. As a druid, I'm constantly asked to join groups.<P>As a wizard, I always have to be the one to ask to get in a group. No exceptions. Ever. An no that's not because I have a bad reputation or that I'm anti-social. In fact, if you can't get along with me, you probably can't get along with most people.<P>Now, a lot of higher level druids say that as you increase your level, your group desireability goes down. Well all I can say to that is, play a Wizard and you'll stop complaining. Druids need to realize it can get worse, lots worse.<P>Make wizards wanted more in groups. If people find the suggestions here in this thread to be unrealistic and outragous, then by all means conduct a survey with the other classes and ask them who they prefer in groups and why. And when that survey inevitably shows a chronic absence for wizards, ask them, 'why not a wizard?' and see what they tell you.<P>...sorry about any spelling errors, I didn't spell check this time heheh</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Its really that simple, its not my job to read all this stuff, why did you decide to cram all this in the last minute and then comment how tough the job is?  This should have been done a long time ago (like I suggested, then the thread was locked and I got a warning).<P>"Please, stop taking my comments out of context and getting all angry about them. Please read the entire post before getting critical about what I said. And I wrote that in the post that I made to start the thread, not in part 2. And I was talking only about the meager list that I had made before starting the thread, not player suggestions. If you really want me to read what you've written, please do me the same favor. You do all of our customers a disservice by misrepresenting my posts that way."<P>Look over the posts of the other classes and tell me that there isn't nit picky stuff in there.  Honestly.  But this is the only one that we get that comment from, why is that?  See how that makes people feel?  Why even SAY that about our concerns, we wouldn't have posted them if they meant nothing to us, that just feels like a slap in the face, and you should know that before putting it to print.<P>Alan, the problem is you barely expanded that original list, left some stuff off, and then didnt post again for like a week.  All it takes is something like<P>"still reading, boy you guys have a lot to say" <P>and we get the impression you aren't simply blowing off what we have to say.  The fact you totally left off VERY CRITICAL problems from all your lists makes us very nervous.  The fact you are talking about putting a final list up before you go out sounds like you want to avoid discussion of your ideas.<P>I'm sorry if this sounds overly critical or upset, but by Norrath I AM upset, its not like we haven't faced this for almost two years, please give us SOME indication that it will be different this time, or tell us it won't be, at least we can have some peace of mind.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Muktuk, there are two problems in regards to desirability:<P>1)  Bad press (which you already pointed out), and 2) the inability to provide enough value to your group.<P>Regarding #2:<BR>I don't know what level you are, but I do know that at the high levels of the game, groups generally care about one thing: XP (ok, and phat lewts)!<P>That said, for day to day grouping, a mage, necro, or druid is a much better choice for improving group efficiency in an XP group.  A wizard is a better choice in a dungeon where the group is unfamiliar.<P>I have a lady wizard friend who's an excellent wizard (studies the class, the game, the other classes, knows all the "extras" a wizard can add to the group, can execute, etc.), friendly and nice as can be, and absolutely cannot get into a pickup group.  Perhaps attitudes about wizards vary a bit from server to server, but on my server this attitude is quite apparent.  Some don't want us because of bad press, but on my server it's 80% (guessing here since I've havent done a formal poll) due to our lack of efficiency in a typical group.  These people don't care about our "surgical" strike capabilities because they know their XP areas like the back of their hand and they don't need that kind of safety.<P>If wizards were able to use their AE spells more, I would have no problem with our inneficiency for the single target game, but the vast majority do not.<P>To me, this is a balance issue.<P>Sineed, I shouldn't have to start another class to make up for what my wizard is *supposed* to be able to do in the first place.  Plus, some people just don't have the time to level up more than one character.  The fact that I can start another class does not make things balanced.  I don't get your logic.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Muktuk, I have NEVER seen a shout for a group looking for a "nuker."  I see LFG for healer, I see LFG for tank, I see LFG for Enchanters because every healer is better with a Breeze or Clarity.  I have never, ever, EVER seen a group shouting "Group looking for nuker."  Doesn't happen.  Know why?  Because EVERY CASTING CLASS CAN NUKE.  <P>Even though they rarely need to use them, Enchanters get a few really good nukes.  Mages get nukes as good as a Wizard's, just not as often or as many.  Necromancers can nuke, and get HP back for doing it, HP they can convert to mana.  Clerics can nuke quite well, especially Undead.  Shamen are great nukers, especially with a Jaundiced Bone Bracer.  Druids nuke great, I group with one every day and she nukes like a Wizard and can use Harmony to pull anything we need from any situation.  Bards have manaless nukes, including AoE.  Even a Tank class, Shadowknights, can nuke, and Harm Touch is as good or better than anything a Wizard has.<BR> <BR>The only classes that can't really cast nukes are considered Tank classes.  Paladins and Rangers.  They have a tank's AC, can wear good armor, higher hitpoints than a typical caster, these tanks aren't really casters, they are tanks that can toss small heals (and in a Ranger's case, cast SoW at 39 and up).<BR> <BR>So, you will not see a group "looking for a nuker," because there is NO DEMAND for nukers except in a few very specific raid situations like VS, hardly the object of casual pick-up groups.<BR> <BR>Maybe that's the mistake Verant made when they designed their Wizard class:  They designed it entirely around nuking, but did not give them such clear superiority in nuking that they were in demand for nuking.  I mean, all classes can melee, but the Warrior/Rogue/Ranger classes can clearly melee FAR FAR BETTER than, say, an Enchanter can.  A dozen times better at least.<BR> <BR>But the Wizard, of all the classes that can nuke, only has maybe a few percentage points better nukes than our closest rival in nuking, the Magician.  Farthest down on the nuking list is probably the Enchanter, and a Wizard's nuke isn't even twice as good as an Enchanter's at the same spell level.<BR> <BR>Why would melee superiority be so heavily tilted in the favor of a few classes, but in the realm of Magical Direct Damage, all nuke-capable classes are much more homogenous in capability?  How come my Wizard cannot melee one fourth as effectively as a Shaman, yet also cannot nuke at least five times better than a Shaman to balance the abilities?<BR> <BR>To make up for this unbalancing shortfall in capability, other INT casters got pets to help bolster their melee capabilities.  Wizards did NOT get this helper, yet our nukes and/or melee cpabilities were not boosted to compensate.  <P>In short, Wizards are the most broken of all the classes, because they have not been balanced.  Our meleeing capabilities are near to nothing, we have no pet to compensate for that shortcoming like the other INT classes, we have no unique combat abilities whatsoever, only one non-combat ability which we share with Druids, and to top off that list our nukes are not much stronger than any other nuke-capable class.<BR> <BR>There are only four ways to fix this, pick one:<BR>1.  Give Wizards better nukes (like TWICE as good as now)<BR>2.  Make our current nukes cost one-fourth the mana they now do.<BR>3.  Boost the Wizard's meleeing capabilities significantly.  Traditionally, when a Wizard in fantasy lore gets high enough in stature, he can begin to wield a magic sword if he feels like it.  Maybe after we hit level 30 our melee caps should go up to the same as a Rogue's, and we should be able to equip 1H slash weapons as long as they are magical.  It creates a pretty picture that, while not unbalancing really (we won't get hide/sneak, lockpick, pickpocket, or anything else of a Rogue's, just have the same potential capabilities in the form of caps), that of a battling Wizard with a magic sword fighting in a group of adventurers overwhelmed by enemies.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

While it feels great to blow everything to hell when things go horribly wrong, I think it's ALSO a useful thing to be able to strategically nuke when things go JUST badly enough that the group will have to recover its momentum.  A small add, for example, is probably nothing that a group of any competence can't handle... but I think that with a wizard around, that small add can be barely even *noticeable*.  The puller can continue without breaking stride, because the extra is vaporized.<P>Useful enough?  Beats me.  But it is something that enhances the typical xp grind, because the grind can then withstand the typical minor disturbances that always seem to come up, even if they're not party-threatening.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Muktuk,<P>I agree with your analysis to a point.  Yes, we can all play our wizards to their best ability and help groups make a difference.  The point everyone is making is that a Mage or Druid can substitute for us at any time, no questions asked.  Sure they dont get LURE spells but they get a pet and can blast pretty good if not only 100 points less than our best nukes.<P>The way we make ourselves more of a separate entity from the other classes is to make our direct damage and damaging spells much more noticeable than the other classes, or you give us an ability to do that more often...of course keeping balance in mind.<P>I do not want a pet, group buffs, or such things.  This is left to the other classes.  What I want is to be useful to a group in a way that no other class can touch.  Period.<P>I can play my wizard with great skill and be useful to a group...but it is rare in the high level and lower level game that yo ucan get into groups easily.<P>Lastly, I noticed that much of the focus is only on the High Level game...what about the first 49 levels of being a wizard????  I do recall at level 34 being outdamaged by a mage...even one point more damage is insulting to the master of magical damage no matter how Verant tried to assure me I was.<P>It is not an easy task and I wish Absor and Verant tuning staff, GOOD LUCK!<P>Check Six!<P>Ziffnab, 53rd Wizard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Okie dokie, I have retuned my thoughts on wizard's spells to include a NON-buffing aspect.  Here's a suggestion, Absor, I hope this can help the team at least get new ideas to help the wizard class.<P>Ok, here it is...wizards have a "Thirst for Knowledge"...to help balance the wizard in groups, wizards want MUCH more mana efficiency, MUCH more dmg, MUCH more group-friendly tactics.  Okie dokie, I can take out all those 4 in one shot.  *Loads his RL version of Ice Comet*<P>The wizard can begin as he always has...a weak little pup (though I didn't have much trouble lvling my wizard, root actually held well..and still does.)  Anyway, starting at maybe lvl 12, wizards should be made to research ways of the magics.  Like, at lvl 12 your guildmaster would give you a book and say: You've learned alot from me, but now you must train in ways to make your magics more powerful, faster, and more efficient.  <P>The book, written in ONE of the languages available in the game have to be read by the wizard....it will give u a quest in which you must seek out other masters over the world and bring them items they seek (though not the usual "bring me a rat whisker" quests  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  )  Once the master is found, perhaps he can offer REAL advice for the wizard and have an NPC spawn so that the master can train the wizard how to cast, and what spells to use and techniques to use.  Like at 20, the master can say: stun this monster with Tishan's clash when he is ready to heal and he will be interrupted...then add a monster that is weak (and spawns after the master speaks to the wizard), can be soloed...has a LONG casting time on heal, but is only interrupted by stun...and is not resistant at all to magic. (in other words a gimme monster kill...but it would be like training in a RP sense.)  The basis is, once u kill the monster, you get it's head and hand it to the master and he then gives you the ability to cast: faster, more efficiently on mana, and with more dmg.  (Each master of course as u lvl would add to this dmg, efficiency and speed.)<P><BR>Now, at lvl 12 you will get alittle stronger...and as you progress, you can learn an ability called, "Teach."  Maybe, say, at lvl 20.  This ability, when used on others, will impart your knowledge to them, and they will gain more efficiency in mana, faster spell casting, and more dmg in their blasts.  It would be like a "bind wound" sorta spell...maybe add some advice the wizard would tell a group member: "Clear your mind of all distractions and focus on the weakness of the monster.  Once you see where to strike him, use these words to amplify your magical damage: Al'Kabor."  &lt;-- or something less cheesy  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P><BR>It should be an ability that can be used 5 times an hour...so that u can "teach" your 5 members in your group (your ability as a wizard would be inate) to cast better...of course, since you'll have tanks, not everyone will use them all, but hey  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Anyway, this limits wizards just using the "teach" skill to give every caster in a zone more dmg/faster speed/more efficiency.  Also, it should be relatively fast to use this skill on ppl, as making it take awhile would be annoying to re-do every so often when it wears off (like every hour i'm envisioning  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  ) <P>Also, make each master talk in different tounges and somehow make it so that a wizard can't just look up on a web page what the master wants and just breeze thru without learning the languages...maybe the wizard would have to speak back to the master in words of Old Erudin, or in Dragon and if the wizard doesn't have the skill, then he can't learn yet.<P><BR>Make books drop that wizards can study (in different languages of course) to understand how better to reach the next master, or possibly how to reach a Grand Master at lvl 50 and again at 60 that is the ultimate form of study to make your spells the best ratio of dmg/speed/effieciency.  Of course make these books common drops and drop off monsters that a Wizard can actually kill b4 he needs to know where the masters are =)  (In other words, not like how research dropping items are done now LOL  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  )<P><BR>There, I've added a new use to the wizard...using his arcane knowledge and skills to increase his usefulness in groups, some might say: No other group has to work so hard to be so successful with their class....but it's the intellectual side of the wizard that shines thru.  <P><BR>This could be a REALLY exciting change in EQ...and actually make ppl want to group w/ the wizard once more for his abilty to make mana casting: Faster, Much more mana efficient, and Stronger dmg.  Think, even a cleric has to like the fact that they can cast heals faster w/ less mana  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Krytal<P><BR>P.S.: In case there are any questions, yes I can continue  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  <P><BR>P.S.S.: WHen I mean mana efficient, i'm talking like 20 Ice Comets able to be cast on a full bar of mana at lvl 50....I mean, break it down, no wizard in their right mind would chain cast that, but then again, they'd have enuff mana to last awhile and medding back a bubble of mana could mean getting 2 or 3 spells back.  Compared to other classes and how they use mana to damage things (and have one time casting mana sinks, like pets that continue to dmg) this really isn't an overpowering number.  At this rate, u can forget about "Self-Clarity"...as it wouldn't truly be needed (however, I STILL believe a faster meditation rate is needed for post 35 casters of any class.)<P>Also, with the increased dmg given to the other classes, you help your own aggro because now they are somewhat close ot you in magical dmg, and it's like casting now but only scales up the magical dmg the casters can do.  If you only increased the wizard's dmg output, you'd be raising his aggro alone.  ALSO, when the wizard is OOM, he is contributing to the group because they can STILL cast more efficiently, faster, and stronger.  <P><BR>I don't think this would be the ONLY change needed, but it's a BIG step forward, I hope u liked it Absor  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  <P><BR>Thanks for reading  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>Krytal  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>P.S.S.:  I'm on a roll, shoot me  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  heh, anyway, back to the mana efficient thing again: make it so that only certain "wizard spells" would be this efficient...DDs, Tishan's clash, stuff like that....Root and stuff that would allow soloing can take the regular amount of mana...and actually, our DDs once changed should have a greater chance of breaking root (since we get a major upgrade  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  ) </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, i tell you why we are not desired in exp groups past 51:<P>Mage nukes: 800ish<P>Wizard nukes: 650 (yes, they are a little more mana efficient, but we have no pet and not DS)<P>Druid level 59: 1024 damage (this spell can be bought at vendors)<P>Wizard at level 59: 728 damage<P>Wizard at level 60: No magic based free purchasable Spell. We rely on very very very rare spell drops (hello... Sunstrike... very rare, not too good mana damage ratio)<P>The only solution for us can be a higher mana regeneration, les mana cost for our spells and way more damage (15% is absolutely minimum, make it 30%) for each DD as it is now.<P>If people want a nuker they can get past 50: Wizard, Druid or Mage. All are kinda similiar, sept the WIzard can only nuke and a little snaring and evacing. But who wants to evacuate, if it is way easier to get rezzed? <P>Fizzles and Resists mage our life even more harder. Fast dropping Mobs in case of an overpull? Heheh forget it... our damage output is pathtetic compared to Mobs HP.<P>The new damage dealer, in the short AND the long run are:<P>(1) Rogue<BR>(2) Monk<BR>(3) War<BR>(4) Ranger !<P>A cleric outdamaging me regarding single nukes... that hurts... a cleric outdamaging the 'Master of magical damage'...<P>Natan Magus<BR>60 Sorcerer<P>Mith Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>  Oldark I like your idea except for one problem, shouldn't that be your place in the scheme of things. Why don't you take an apprentice under your care and show them how to use thier spells?<BR>This is a tradition that I personally plan on starting, so while I like your idea I say no you may not have my apprentice. I shall teach my pupil using the experience of 30 levels and I will guide that pupil to 24 at which time it will be his/her turn to learn on thier own and eventually take a student of thier own.( Translation: it's a good idea but it is something that the player base should be doing.)<P> Now to the AE detractors, the concept is working fine there are simply some spells in my book that need some tuning ( Al'Kabor's line namely ). As most enchanters are busy on my server I don't normally need to worry about mez's, I pre-root the mobs I can target, then I unleash unholy death on the poor creatures ( 131x4= 524 for 130 mana, that is simply wonderful! though normally I only get 3 for 393 total ). Tell your tank ( preferably tanks ) what you are doing and they are usally rather compliant with doing what they can to keep you alive.<P> Now for the balance part of this post!<P> I'll concede that it may not be possible to make the wizard more offensive magically ( that is either more damage or more mana ). If this is really how Verant feels how about increasing the defence of the wizard so that argoing the creature onto himself becomes an option with a few less teeth. The blink spell in your update, Absor, is a step in that direction ( a magical solution to our lacking dodge skill ). I've also seen mention of an extreme damage shield that while making you amazingly resistant to damage also make you unable to move ( aka. roots you ). Or seeing that warriors are the kings of taking physical damage how about a self only shield that absorbs spell damage only. I know, I know, you don't want to hear about new spells but when talking defence it doesn't make much sence to increase the wizards defensive skills, thus magic is the only alternative.<P>Well I guess this was just more rambling to add to the rambling, everyone else ramble away. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Heres one i dont think ive heard yet change harvest so that it gives the same amount of mana it does now PLUS it increases the mana recharge rate slighty while the spell refreshes. <P>I was thinking that it could regen the inital amount + double the inital amount over the ten mins   ie at level 34 the inital amount would be 170 + 340 over the next ten mins  it would lower our down time between fights some.<P>Also i had a variation on the focus item ideas ie having some spells that  can use spell components (money sink) the spells that use components could be any of the following 1)harder to resist 2)do more max damage 3)be more mana efficient . You could change all the Al-Krapor lines to these types of spells .<P>Also you could change the Rain spells to single target spell with 4 waves hitting one mob that would be a boon to a good deal of all the caster classes<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,If you get a chance to pop back here a sec i hope you see this. <P>You were talking about the "Blink" spell, great idea but i am a bit worried that it would cause a bit of trouble in a real tight place...maybe if the spell sort of "Phases" the Wizard out of his/her current plane and into a sort of "Negivate" plane so if the MOB starts to attack you it in a way it can't because your not really there so to speak, you can't cast, if you try to sit down you return to your current plane,it lasts for maybe 5 or 10 secounds and has a fast cast time like 1 secound much like the shadowstep line and the recast is farely fast as well like 1 or 2 minutes or less(not too sure what would be best there) so if we want to "nuke up a storm" we can without getting beat on that badly till a tank of sorts gets back to the top of the MOB's hate list.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor to your statement about some epic quests will be harder than others I agree, but should 1 epic quest take 3 days to do and have the ability for 9 different players to do it in that 3 days and another (lets take the necro quest) take 4 months of solid camping so the ONE player gets it?  <P>The rate that they come in the game should be somewhere in the same ball park.  But Verant (who ever designed the rogue and cleric quest) made them DRASTICALLY easier/faster (quest wise) to do (to include how fast they enter the game (number of epics per week in both cases) then others.  Mage's have a hard quest in that they need to break the 7th isle of PoS (a event that takes 30 people 3 days to do) I'm happy with that.  A mage epic is fairly doable if you have the willing friends.  (sure they have to camp quillamaine but I do this for my mage friends and have killed him up to 5 times in 1 day)<P>Compair this to a necro that has to get the same 30 friends and constantly keep fear clear for up to 4 months (this 4 month figure comes from the estimation from other web sites that Cazic Thule is only dropping Cazic Blood about 1 in 20 times and is a 1 week spawn.  There for you may have to clear fear over 20 weeks, which is closer to 5 months, to get the blood)<P>Absor do you see the problem here?  2-3 Necros will get their epic a year if Cazic is constantly camped while 100 rouges could get theirs in the same time frame quiet easily.<P>Plus add to this that for the Necro to get his or her epic a bunch of level 55-60's will march into PoF and upset the level 47-55's that are in there actually doing the zone while no one cares much if a rogue sneaks into fear and pickpockets a mob.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053715-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053715&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053715&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
