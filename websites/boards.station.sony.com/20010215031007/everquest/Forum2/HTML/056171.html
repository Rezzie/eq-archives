</FONT><HR>Couple suggestions:<P>1) Damage shields in PvP:  These are way overpowering against melee classes like rogues, monks and rangers that have very fast, low damage weapons.  They should have been nerfed along with DD and DoT Spell damage.  There is no reason that I should be able to die to an even con druid, mage or Wiz that can't even get a spell off on me, strictly due to damage shield damage.  Also, the damage should be base on the level that the buff is cast on, not the caster that buffed the low level.  If I'm fighting a level 20, that a level 50 druid slapped with a nice damage sheild, its completely unfair.  I'm peircing/slashing often for less than 20 damage, and takeing 25+ each hit strictly due to the damage shield.<P>2) Snare and Darkness resists in PvP:  Way too level dependant.  With a 90+ MR, a red con necro, druid, ranger, or SK has NO problem snaring/darking me, everytime.  Resists should play a bigger part than levels here.<P>3) Harm touch is still WAY to overpowering in PvP:  The damage here is rediculous.  Resists don't even play a fair role.  Also, your refresh rate does not work in PvP.  If an SKs dies, no matter when or how often, in PvP, his harmtouch is availible upon respawning.  Totally and completely unfair.<P>Other than that, thanks for the other fixes.  I think the evade nerf might just work out in our favor in the long run, just please make sure to test it thouroughly before making it lie.<P>Thanks in advance.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1) I agree.  Damage shields still do 100% damage in PvP.  If possible, fix the damage shield damage to 60%, like DD/DOT damage.<P>2) I agree.  IMO, level should not be a factor in PvP resist rates.  It should be based purely on your resistance score.  I can take off all my MR gear and still resist 9 out of 10 snares from a druid 8 levels under me, but a druid 8 levels over would be snaring me 9 times out of 10 with that same MR.  This seems like such an easy fix, too.  Just take "level" out of the equation if the caster and target are both PC's.<P>3)  Harm Touch damage just needs to be cut to 60% like all other DD's in the game.  It's ALWAYS done 100% damage, but it used to be resistable, and really sucked anyway so most people didn't notice.  Now it's basically unresistable versus players and the fact that it doesn't get the standard DD reduction has become obvious.  The slew of new PvP shadowknights is really ridiculous.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Point 1:  Against a fast hitting melee, a damage shield is the single most mana efficient spell.  Making the shield 'proc' based upon the level of the recipient would be nice.<BR>My first thought was that due to code sharing between MOBs and characters, this would not work.  Then I thought about the level range of MOBs.  In one area, most MOBs are of a comparable level to each other.  Those that damage shield others would not have those shields reduced by much.  It could work.<P>Point 2:  Any player cast spell which has a reduced chance to save against is overpowered in PvP.  Code sharing stops this from really being fixable.  Any reduction in saves versus the movement reduction spells will have a HUGE impact against the characters who use that tactic against MOBs.  In example - in PvP, Verant could give snare a chance to break each time magical damage is done (like root).  This would carry over to any snared MOB.  Druids, Necros and Rangers immediately loss the most common way they fight.  Any melee who uses a weapon which procs a snare suddenly becomes far more powerful (unless they are also using a DD procing weapon).  Just increasing the resist rates would have a different effect - it would take longer to get a snare to stick, leading to more chances that someone is going to be trained over.<P>Point 3:  Pretty much total agreement.  If I am logged in as a caster, why do my spells take the 66% nerf but a virtually uninteruptable ability which has a chance to "one hit" a caster at high level does not.  Worse yet, if the shadowknight is bound near the fight, he can return to harmtouch every 30 seconds or so.  Paladin lay on hands and shadowknight harmtouch have a built in timer of one game day.  All Verant needs do is set the timer to start counting before it can be used.  In other words, paladin/shadowknight spawns at bind point with the ability greyed out.  One game day later the ability is usable.  The code already exists.  Look at the wizard spell 'Harvest' -- once memorized, the gem remains greyed out for 10 minutes.  Divine Aura and Spirit of Cheetah show this as well.<P>The evade nerf should not affect PvP at all.  Evade should give the rogue a chance to cause the other character to lose targetting.  Or better yet, cause the evaded character to target something else!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>my biggest gripe here is with the damage shields and throwing. That bothers me to no end. It only discourages the few players out there who DO choose throwing over archery...<P>though I do like the enhancements recently given to throwing. I use it a lot more, now... just not on mobs or players with damage shields.<P>I didn't have a problem with damage shields and snare in PvP with the egg-shaped pumice around. That gave us an opportunity to throw the odds in our favor, though it did cost a lot of money. <P>having to stand still for 5 seconds just makes that thing completely useless. I think if you put the egg-shaped pumice back, it would at least give a possible solution to the problems caused by snare and damage shields in PvP. Any other fix would screw up PvE. <P>And as far as the harm touch thing goes... I agree entirely. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The extremely useful and over powered (that was sarcasm!) upgrade to the wizard 'never should have had' damage shield does 5 to 6 points damage.  No more.  I can see some fights in the sub 12th level range being decided by this one, but beyond that.........<P>I fully agree that damage shields should ONLY function when you hit the target with melee damage IN MELEE RANGE.

</FONT><HR>Putting egg shaped pumice back on PvP servers would be a simple solution to a LOT of imbalances.  They really leveled the playing field for everyone, and a lot of things are out of whack without them.<P>I don't think anyone was referring to WIZARD damage shields.  Magicians and druids (and perhaps rangers after the patch) have some VERY nasty damage shields.  A rogue is lucky to do more damage per hit than she is taking from the shield.<P>Against a clever player, damage shields cannot be pumiced with Crystallized Pumice.  The pumice is too weak, and there are too many instant-casting buff items in the game.  You can't debuff me with new pumice faster than I can replace my buffs.  You will never work your way up to the damage shield.<P>And yeah, taking fireshield damage from hitting people with a ranged weapon (like arrows) is an old bug that should be fixed.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Damage shields are ridiculous.  If someone my level has their own shield on it's a pain in the butt, but can be handled.  If they have a higher level damage shield on, then as a rogue, forget about it, I'm dead.  Whoever suggested we have a high damage, high delay weapon has obviously never played a rogue.<P>And the fact that my throwing star also causes me to take shield damage is about the stupidest thing I've ever seen.  Explain how that works.<P>Magic resistance is the most important stat to keep track of on a pvp server, and it's not easy for the average player to get it high.  At level 23 my rogue has 83 MR, and anyone even con and higher will land just about every snare/root/darkness on me they cast.  83 unbuffed MR is high for my level yet it really has no effect unless I'm fighting someone lower level than me.  If I'm rooted, I'm dead.<P>Egg shaped pumice.  The single most horrible nerf in the game imo.  If I'm rooted, and someone is bashing my brains in while I try to pumice, with that casting time it will be interupted every time.  And if it does work it most likely will take off a "good" buff first before it erases the root.<P>Please start looking at PvP Verant.  You're going to lose alot of customers if you don't.

</FONT><HR>I agree completely.<P>Damage shields causing damage to a player using throwing weapons should be fixed.<P>Damage shields are also highly unbalancing when you consider that higher level players can cast these shields on lower level friends who can then strike with impunity against players of their own levels.  One may say that Verant doesn't want to tamper with player's options but it seems in the past that Verant has put in safeguards against "powerleveling" on PvE servers (experience limitations when grouping with players higher than you, %damage done determining who gains exp) why ignore similar discrepancies in the PvP world?<P>I echo as well the wish that egg shaped pumice should be returned to the PvP servers.

</FONT><HR>Nerf damage shields because high level players are casting it on low level players? Sounds to me that it isn't a problem with Damage Shields but with high level players helping low level players.  <P>And we have dealt with that before, haven't we? Remember when high level clerics sat around healing their low level comrades thus making them virtually invincible? I am curious, but did that ever get solved? If so, perhaps the same balancing factor used in that could be used with damage shields.  Calling a general nerf to damage shields, though, is unrealistic.  All you would do is further weaken mages, who are already weak in PvP.<P>To those high levels who says they get killed by damage shields attacking casters... I'm curious, how the heck did you die with 2000+ hps versus someone who has around 1000 hps and a damage shield that does less damage to you than your weapon does to them? To the rogue who said she took more damage from damage shields than from her weapons - perhaps that's because your strategy... Poking your enemy till they die... Isn't exactly the best way to PvP with a rogue?<P>To tell you the truth, rogues can be exceptionally deadly if they wanted to be, as can alot of the other classes.  However, I suggest that you use the environment and timing to your advantage instead of expecting an honorable, one on one duel or a "charge in and randomly attack" fight.  The best rogues aren't the ones who charge out into the open while wizards nuke'em and sk's HT them and warriors bash'em and if you think about that, it makes sense.  <P>Catch them unawares... While they are returning from a battle, or resting from a heavy fight.  Unless you're a paladin or SK, honor should seldom be a factor when we're dealing with day to day racewar.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Honestly I don't think harmtouch should be reduced to 66% dmg (this is comming from a pvp teams necro).  This is a once a day thing and in all my time on PvP I've never seen a necro go ask a buddy to pk him to get his harm touch back.  Harmtouch and lay hands seem to be working fine.  In PvP unless the melee is twinked most melee's if they're not twinked, usually can't touch a caster for long(whether its becuase of snare/root/pet root/mez, and shadow step)<P>I seriuosly am getting tired of hearing people whine that HT is too powerful, all I see in people complaining are those who have been harmtouched, or as everyone seems to call it death touch(I'll get to that in a moment), one too many times and want to call a nerf on the SK class.<P>Then there's that word death touch...  Well 'death touch' to me is non exsistant, becuase the only time it even comes close to doing ALMOST all of a caster's hp is when the SK is 8 level's higher than them and any pvper knows its damn hard to beat anyone 8 level's higher than them, so why should an Sk even waste a Ht on someone 8 levels lower than them when they can often destroy the person without it?<P>Time for some quotes:<P>"Worse yet, if the shadowknight is bound near the fight, he can return to harmtouch every 30 seconds or so."<P>Well seeing that an SK can only be bound in cities... you're obviuosly fighting him/her near one of thier own cities and frankly, when you are going Pking/raiding a city of pc's expect to die in one way or another.<P>Then again I suppose I can see how this can be abused (freeport is the best example I can think of, keep in mind I don't play rallos).  Maybe if a SK is killed by a mob HT is recycled?  After all casters get full mana if a mob kills them.<P>Maybe its because I'm a necro and can take my HP right back /shrug but right now I don't see a need for a HT reduce.  I'll be happy to argue anyone else's good points, flames not appriecated.<P>(sorry if there is bad spelling, don't feel like doing the whole spell check thing right now <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">) </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"Rogues don't have high damage high delay weapons. Rogue weapons are low damage low delay."<P>The fact that rogues can double bs for 1k of dmg should make up for that.<P>Dmg shields should not be nerfed in PvP. As it is now melees are in general much more powerful than casters, at least on the team servers where people are wearing gear in PvP. If you die to a caster at higher levels it's because you can't play properly or it's because you are too lazy to get resist gear. Many players are practically immune to the spells such as snare, root, dark.<P>So instead of coming here saying that you got stomped by a caster get in touch with a more experianced player and ask him what you should do.<P>HT needs to be nerfed though to 66% though.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
