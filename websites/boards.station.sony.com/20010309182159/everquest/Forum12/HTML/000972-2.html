</FONT><HR>It is truely amazing the number of wizards that bring up this same stupid argument with no backing about once a month.<P>First of all alot of you seem to not even know what the abv DD means. DD means Direct Damage. Magician bolt spells are not direct damage spells and never have been. Most of the wizards saying mages are stupid if they cant figure out how to use a bolt have never used one. Untill a few patches ago wizards bolt spells wernt even bolts, they were direct damage spells with a bolt graphic. Bolt spells are extreamly unreliable, you can shoot a bolt at a mob that isnt moving and has nothing between it and you and have the bolt not hit. The code for bolt is extreamly buggy and will probably never be fixed, and untill they are wizards have no right to complain that mages have a bolt that does more damage than a wizard DD of the same level.<P>And for all of you complaining about one stupid spell, why dont you take a look at the spell mages are useing untill they get cinder bolt? They are useing a level 24 magic based shock spell doing 176 damage.<P><BR>"So, yes, magicians DO at times have the bigger nuke"<P>A nuke and a DD are not the same thing, dont confuse the two. And dont think because you can use a low level low casting time bolt without problems that you could use a higher casting time bolt around in a dungeon with 4 things fighting the mob you are trying to hit. In case you didnt know, if you have to spend time lineing up for the bolt you are loseing meditating time.<P><BR>""Now I know, rastasus, has never played a mage or a wizard before.""<P>yeah... you just keep telling yourself that...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Gate as well, especially when a pet is involved.<P>Not to mention your Water pet casts a free Ice DD and your fire pet is ready made with DS and flame nuke.<P>I have a 24 wiz and a 16 Mage. The only thing I think Mages really need is some variety. Improved Pet control would be nice too but not vital.<P>Wizards need an overhaul. I don't think we should be doing double the damage of Mages but Wizards need to count more than just faster casting time and less mana consumption. Who can cast more than two blasts in a fight without aggroing? I can solo no better than you can. I can maybe take a two spawn if I eat a death or zone since I'm usually OOM halfway through #2. I don't get the luxury of meding during the fight and good luck medding while something is rooted.  Root/Enstill are too unpredicatable to leave unchecked. They can break in 6 secs or 120 secs.

</FONT><HR>""Bottom line is this: No single blast by a magician should ever, under any circumstances, of any kind, of any mana efficiency nor casting time do more damage than a similar levelled Wizard. Never. Verant might be waking up to this, according to some of Absor's comments.<P>Bottom line is this: No single blast by a magician should ever, with any delay, with any type of damage, with any mana cost EVER cast faster than a similar levelled Wizard.""<P>This is like saying that no weapon should ever have as high of a damage value on it as a warriors weapon and no weapon should ever have a lower delay on it than a warriors weapon. You are totaly ignoring the other aspects of the weapons. A weapon with 100 damage doesnt really mean much if it has a 1000 delay and a weapon with a 14 delay doesnt do much with 1 damage.<P>It doesnt matter that mages have a bolt at level 34 with a higher base damage than the wizard DD at the same level because that doesnt change the fact that the wizard spell is better.  And god damn, dont even start on scars of sigil. Scares is worse than Char, and Char is pretty damned pathetic as a spell.  Any mage that tries to use scars of sigil as his nuke in a group is being stupid. The only use I have found for this spell is pulling in outdoor zones and cutting runners down fast. The spell is less mana effecient than our 52 direct damage, which in turn is less effecient than our 49th level bolt.<BR>Dont even try compairing your post 50 spells to mage post 50 spells, mages were so screwed over on this spells it isnt funny.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wayshapr, <P>I agree with you.  What I don't like is everyone saying mages need to be nerf because we have this "uber" pet.  You know as well as I do, that with a pet is a very specific sutuation. (a single mob, with no other jumping in) that mages ROCK.  <P>To sum up my whole point it seem that the way most wizzies wanna address their short commings is to call for mage nerfs.  I would have no problem is the mana cost and damage is increased for Wizzies.  <P>Just don't through the blame for it not happening at mages.  Both classes have serious 50+ issue.  and aguring about it isn't going to help.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

But this is an important point.<P>Possibly too many monsters have high magic resistance, and this does affect wizards a lot more than magicians because their pets can beat on<BR>the monsters regardless.<P>When things go wrong though wizards have a better chance to escape (by going wrong I am assuming monsters have got to the caster, so don't say<BR>but the pet will protect the magician, because by going wrong we can assume the pet is dead or away on other business).<P>Should wizards have improved DD spells? probably, they already have the width lacking in the magicians DD spells, but then pets do count for a lot. A magician can indeed do some levels without having to cast a DD spell if they chose to do<BR>so. The nukes for a magician are to complement the pet. The wizard is there to nuke until they are oom and then root and teleport out. So sure, add some more variety in for the wizards, up the damage a bit and reduce the cast time even further so that its easier to get off when actually in combat (hopefully doesn't happen much). They won't cast too often anyway because they will get aggroed and forced to flee.<P>In the same vein though, I would also say that Magicians are slightly misrepresented because its always pet this and pet that, pet will rock their world and save your life.<P>Well, maybe. It might also run off and bring back more monsters than you thought existed to blick yourself and everyone near you. Is this bad control by the magician? well in some cases I don't doubt that it is. You learn the skills you have available and you use them as you can to best affect. The problem with pets in a word is 'dungeons'. <P>A pet in a dungeon is too easily a passport to the netherworld. Again careful use will allow it to be useful, but it takes time effort and a headache.<P>So. Give Wizards better DD's and make that pet behave itself.<P>As for calls for magicians to have escape spells? well maybe, but the pet is fairly useful for running. You just need to know when to run.<P>We should stop pointing at each other saying but.. but.. but.. I want that, cos they have it.<BR>We both have strengths and weaknesses, and they are different. We should in fact be working to make sure both classes move further apart rather than sucking them in together.<P>If as a wizard you want a pet on your side? team with a magician. If as a magician you want faster, more powerful direct damage spells? team with a wizard. That way you get a pet who tanks and two powerful direct damage casters nuking it (one faster and harder than the other)and should things go pearshaped you have twice as many options for getting out of there. resummon pet to hold it off, root it, snare it and then run like crazy.<P>I play a magician btw. The above team sounds good, possibly relegate the magician away from the<BR>DD spells and into a fireshield, pet healing, resummoning machine and that would work even  better IMHO. What I don't want to see is a series of classes which are the same except for the occasional spell. There are already enough common traits/spell within the casters.<P>Thats all folks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Simple reply to all those of you who think that root and shoot is the balls. Make a wizard. Get to level 4. Try it. Go back to playing whatever it is you play for real. Root is not a good spell at low levels, and it gets worse as you grow. IF the root holds for more than 2 blasts you are REAL lucky. You are luckier if you can actually cast the second root. If you are not SoWed, don't bother to try, unless you like losing exp that is.  <P>Also, if anyone thinks that shadowstep/yonder line is anything more than a joke, again, try it. They don't go uphill, they dont go to water, the dont go through objects and they are random, so if they DO give you distance, chances are it is just enough to aggro that sand giant. Wizards dont have escape spells either, unless you count evacs, and that wont help unless you are in a group, and not the subject of aggro.<P>Another thing to consider is this, when you aggro the mob off your pet, at least the pet is still hurting the mob. If we aggro the mob and the root breaks, our melee is so pathetic, we get to do 2 points from our rediculous damage shield. We can't cast "our fast casting, quick recycling" spells any better than you can cast slower spells. But you still do damage from your pet, better damage shields, and DOT's at higher levels. Not to mention that you could have debuffed them, so your effective DD before aggro would have been higher because of resists.<P>I am not saying that a Mage would not die in the above situation. I am just saying, you would have a slightly better chance than the wizard. <P>I am not one to say nerf anyone. I know that the melee classes have benifited from many changes (I play primarily warriors and Paladins) But having extensively played Encanters, Mages, and now a Wizard, I can tell you, The wiz is worse off. PERIOD. They are a cornerstone class in EQ. They are supposed to be focused and fill a defined roll. One that they cannot fill. That is the one and only complaint I and most of the wizards present have. The Mage has a roll, it fills it fairly well. Could they tune the roll a bit to make mages more fun? sure? but they didn't lie to you when you took the class. Same as clerics. You knew going in you were support. When the same can be said for wizards we will all go and play.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The problem here, is not Magician Damage vs Wizard Damage.  They are on par with eachother.  As you can see there are argument both ways blah blah blah blah.<P>What we should be complaing about is Wizard/magician Damage post 50 compared to Melee.  If anyone has turned the table on damage it's them.  Nukes for both classes need to be upped at least 15%, and I love the super long cast, extra hard damage nuke.  Definitly should be added for Wizzies.<P>As for terminology, make sure you use the correct one when creating arguments.<P>DD = Direct Damage.  Any form of spell that is hostile in nature and inflicts harm instantly after the spell is cast.<P>Nuke = Any form spell that is hostile in nature that does full damage to its target in one hit.  All Damage spells that do all their damage in one shot are under this category.  <P>DoT = Damage over Time.  Any form of spell the does it's full Damage over a period Time. <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Basically this is how I see things, and the Magicians I know in the game agree.  Wizards should focus more on blasts, Magicians on their pets.  Making god pets that freak out in dungeons didn't work for balance, Verant figure that out eventually.  The problem is now Magicians have... tough pets that aren't nearly as good but STILL have psychotic pathing.<P>The answer is better control and pathing (their 'come back you dumbass pet' spell is a good example off them leaning this way), better summons for your pets (many good suggestions in Mage Talk thread) and more petlike options (like a decoy at lower levels that works).<P>Wizards can blast big, you can blast a lil and add pets to it for great power.

There is no reason to fight about who is better, Wizards are Mages.  That is never what was intended.<P>What was intended was to bring up the topic that at the certain 10-level span (30s) that I'm locked into right now, it's apparent that Wizards have been screwed into being very little help to a group situation, especially when compared to other 'primary nukers' (Mage).<P>Some of you may say that the fact that we get root, snare, and evacs/ports gives the reason to let you mages have higher damage spells and betters pets.<P>LOL<P>What caster doesn't have root/snare?  Obviously Mages don't have it because they have something to replace it - PETS.  <P>My thread wasn't referring to soloing situations AT ALL.  That is apparent.  The largest consideration that I had referred to the lack of invites to groups that I get while at these levels.<P>I've been in groups with many Mages, and especially in Dungeons, when many of them simply don't even bring a pet up, they still do more damage than I do, even if it is marginal, 10-15dmg, even if they are several levels beneath me.<P>I'm not going to spend 4 days researching numbers or equations, I don't have that much time on my hands.. all I know is what I've seen IN GAME, IN GROUP, where it counts.  50+ may be where it counts once you get there, but everything beneath 50+ is where it counts before hand...<P>And what the heck is the point of ports when related to a group?  I've evaced a group maybe once, or twice.. and I've only ever done it after the cleric and primary tank calls for it.  Running teleports throughout Norrath doesn't offer experience each time you zone...<P>My aggrivation is during the pursuit of experience, and the enjoyment of my character.  It is not fun.. when me, the Wizard, nukes being my only reason for being there, primarily, am being upstaged by the Magician for a 10-level duration, and possibly more-so...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Chew on this mages.<P>How would you feel if Necro's got 4 pets that had 4 different abilties, the exact same as your pets? However, your the masters of pets, so necro's have to have a bad point. Lets say their pets are 1 level lower than yours. Hm...needs one more bad point. So sometimes they get these pets every second spell level, instead of every spell level like you. So it would be a little like this:<P>Level 29:Mage Pets<BR>Level 29: Necro Pets<BR>Level 34: Mage Pets<BR>Level 34: Necro pets<BR>Level 39: Mage Pets<BR>Level 44: Mage Pets<BR>Level 44: Necro Pets<P>Oh, did I mention that because they dont get pets at level 39, they're level 34 pets are stronger than yours until you get your new ones?<P>Doesnt seem fair does it? What would you think Necro's would say if they had this from startgame? I'll bet the same lame excuses as Mages.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>EvantineEssidel, you arent making any sence at all... you might want to try rewording your post.<P>Necros get a single pet that is better than any of the mage pets untill level 44 where the mage pets(some types at least) become better...  So I am not sure what point you are trying to make.<P>I dont think any mage would care if necros had 4 pets that worked like mage pets, as that would make thier pets less effetive than they are now. I think most mages would be happy with that.<P>Do you have any idea how annoying it is for our pets to do less damage than necro pets because they stop attacking for a round every few seconds to cast a pathetic attack spell that does less damage than the melee attacks they would have done in that time? Yet do you see 20 mage posts filling the boards whining about this? No, because we(as a class) understand that we have some advantages over the necromancer when it comes to groups.<P><BR>Once again, I have no idea what point you were trying to make. What would a necro petting multiple pets every other spell level have to do with anything?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yeah, I bet you HATE it when your pets (most of whom have more hit points and better AC than necro pets) stop and cast stun or root.  What a waste of time and mana huh?  Especially after complaining about root not being one of your spells.<P>But Rastasus, is she wrong because Necros already have better pets (which they don't but you think so and say shouldn't be true)?  Isn't that just what we've been saying, we are masters of magical damage (yes, we are, Verant says so) and yet some levels we are out done in it.  And you agree that your pets should be better, and are upset that they aren't.

They are constantly pulling mobs, 1 at a time, sometimes get 2 by accident (where the enchanter then mezzes).  They say, lets get a 6th.<P>(THIS IS A VERY COMMON SCENARIO)<P>They hear the shout<P>lvl 24 mage looking for group<BR>lvl 24 wiz looking for group<P>Who would you take?<P>Okay lets compare what they will bring:<P>Mage: DD, another tank, damage shields<BR>Wiz: DD, stun, root<P>Frost Shock<BR>Lvl 24<BR>Mana 110<BR>Cast time 3.1<BR>Damage max 183<P>Shock of Blades<BR>Lvl 24<BR>Mana 110<BR>cast time 3.5<BR>Damage max 176<P>So, who is your choice?<P>The wizard with a spell that is 4% more efficient? What else can he offer? Well, he has no evacs...hmmm...no snares......hmmmm....no buffs....I know...he can STUN a mob for almost 2 seconds and maybe...er...root it? But, unfortunately, root breaks and the enchanter can stun and mez way better than the wizard.<P>Or the mage, whose pet could probably solo one of the tanks in your group, that absorbs some hits meant for the tanks, that is expendable in emergencies, that roots/stuns/nukes, etc. The mage who casts a 9 point damage shield that is unresistable, and uber mana efficient? The mage who can nukes the same as the wizard (no one will ever notice the 4% difference in damage).<P>I think a group at any level should be indifferent regarding who they would like in a group of a wizard and a mage or a necro if they are looking for a damage caster.<P>The CLEAR fact of the above scenario is that only a braindead vegetable would take a wizard over a mage, and that is UNACCEPTABLE!!!!!!!!!!<P>If a group doesn't want you over a wizard, then you obviously have a reputation of being incompetent or they don't know how powerful you are.<P>Gates will never get us in an exp group (never ever been asked for an evac as I play 90% of the time in Kunark--can we say deathtrap evac)?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It is not until much later that the classes really begin to reach their potential. Only then is it really appropriate to judge utility in any given group.<P>At level 24 Wizards have not gotten their group escape spells which is supposedly a significant aspect and class ability.  <P>So given the choice at level 24 and the group is outdoors I would go with the Mage.  If the group was indoors such as Sol A or Perma I would likely want to go with the Wizard especialy since many mages have not learned the finer aspects of pet control in dungeon settings and can easily become a big detriment to a group (sometimes through no fault of their own).  <P>You must recognize that while pets are very nice and at high levels they are a force to be reconed with, they also can be more of a hinderance and a danger to the party.  There are very big downsides to pets and that must be considered as well.  People sometimes forget that.  Nonpet casters do not have this problem or bagage.  So in that regard they are preferable.  This is very true in the endgame as many mages are being excluded from groups because of the perception (real and imagined) that the pets are more trouble then their benefits.<P>At certain levels and certain places in the world some classes that have similar abilities that are better than the supossed masters.  I remeber in the late 20s and early 30s getting out nuked by a cleric.  Does that seem right?  Not at the time, but I didn't get upset about it.  Some things in the game are for variety's sake so playing your class doesn't become too 1 dimensional (like the occasional cleric big nuke).<P>I really believe from everything I have seen that wizards pre50 are pretty good in the dd department and what is needed for balance for them is a vast improvement of their travel and evac abilities so that they are much more usefull.  I am not saying it should not be tweeked or the variety more meaningful, it should be.  For example in addition to Frost shock at 24 I think wizards should also get Fire shock and Air shock.  All have the same damage, casting times, etc., just different mob saves.  That is true versatility that I think the wizard should have.  To be able to choose the approppriate magical damage depending upon the mob fought.  (They have this now, but obviously not to this degree).<P>To make it more fun, allow for roleplay as well as help distinguish good wizards from mediocre wizards that the the fire and air frost would be obtained by questing.  This would alternate types, frost at 24, fire at 29, etc.<P>Can you imagine if Wizards had the ability to set their own evac bind point (outdoors only).  This would make evac spells extremely usefull and reduce downtime and make them worthwhile and thus the wizard more group friendly.  Right now I get the impression that the evac's benefits are not really worth it except in extreme circumstances and that is a pity.<P>Post 50 all of the casters have problems with the huge hp and magic resistant mobs.  They really screwed all of us up.<P> <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
