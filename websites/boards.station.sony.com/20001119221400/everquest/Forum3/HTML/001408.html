</FONT><HR>I have further problems with the Troopers Pike quest (i.e. The Triplets Heads). There isn't any real clue text dialog that flows with the finishing of the Soldiers Pike quest (Memory of Sebilis). The reason I say something is that there is a flow with all other pike quests to the next pike, so this remains an odd start for this quest.  You can only find out about the quest by asking around Cabalis about a certain someone that resides in the Swamp of No Hope. Even then, when you help this certain someone, no one else will comment on the quest.  This is a little odd since the SoNH garrison would probably know about this situation. There is also a text issue with the Class title of a warrior.  I'm not sure if this is still a current problem but at one time your class didn't aggree with the class stated on the note.  Also the barron of the swamp had a text issue with the type of pike you were to hand in (said footmans pike instead of soldiers pike) if you handed in one of the heads.<BR>The Iksar warrior quests explain a good tale about the trials and tribulations that a warrior would go through when trying to obtain his/her next warrior title/class rank. The fixing of this text stumbling block would help keep the line of quests in a cohesive package that would keep the tale moving yet still allow us "Questers" the difficult chalange to figure them out.<BR>The Issue with the Krupt Warrior guards pertaining to the Legionaire's Mancatcher Pike seems to have been addressed but it seems that these should drop in the Froglok city like the Sarnak Legionaires brains do in the LoIO. As of yet extensive hunting in SoNH (and every where else around cabalis) has left all of us scratching our collective heads as to where Krup Warrior Guard shields could possiblily be. So, a simple "yes there in the game somewhere" would solve our delema and keep us searching.<BR>Thanks for lending an ear to our problems and to all of the work you have done so far.<P>Amenshan (E'ci)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ONe of the more annoying parts of the "pike" line of quests for warriors is the fact that if you fail in your attempt to forge the pike, you lose it all. You lose your Geozite tool, which is a pain in the butt to get in the first place (it's another quest), and you lose all your foraged items, thank goodness we now don't lose the note as well!!<BR>I would really recommend that we not lose the geozite tool if it fails to combine the head of the pike. It is a completely different quest that we already worked hard for, and it's a pain to continuously have to get those components, let alone the components to try to make the pike head again.<BR>I have done the geozite tool quest now, in total over 15 times, and I am getting sick of it.<BR>I also agree with the others in that the quests are very vague. I used to play on test, and I would say that the ONLY reason anyone figured out the first upgraded pike quest (kill the froglock escort, and then the traitor for his head) is because someone who actually tested for Verant slipped it into this guy's guild (it was the bigger one there.) Why do I say that? Because those pies that are needed to get the traitor to spawn are also foraged in Warslisk Woods. How is anyone supposed to make the correlation? Besides from asking every single NPC in all of Cabilis, these quests are just... too vague, too work intailed for the end product, especially if you are constantaly losing your stupid geozite tool to failures.<BR>Thanks for listening!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Not sure if this is technically a "warrior" quest, but it involves the Legion..<P>The Legion restraining order quest that starts with the Clerk in the tink'n'babble tavern.. <P>The reward for this quest is one of several LORE NO-DROP books, but none of these books have any text, or any defined use.<P>Thinking maybe that the text was left out...<P>re: Some other issues that have been raised..<P>Froglok bounders -&gt; Might just be unlucky, I had a drop rate of about 20% when I was hunting them, and i still kill them whenever I see them in case any other warriors are hunting them.<P>Memory of Sebilis -&gt; There are actually NPC's that talk about it, and give you hints about who stole them, and also how to get he ruby.. However, there doesn't seem to be anything that points you even in the vague direction of Kurn's tower, and it's only after other people reported encountering the thick-bone that people put it together with the thick-skulled bandits that stole the gems...<P>Marauder Snout Ring Quest - This quest is definetly out of whack, killing mobs that are blue to a level 20 to get 4 uncommon drops, and you get armor thats worse than the stuff you get for killing 8 level 1 wolf pups.. The black leather look is nice, but it'd be nicer if it had better than patchwork stats..<P>Pike recipes from the smith - these seem to be correct now, after going through several iterations..<P>Geozite tool quest - These are defineatly a pain, especially the swamp of no hope one, as it requires 8 items, whereas the others only require 4. And the escaped froloks are also hunted by necro's and monks for their quests.. All my geozite tools have been obtained by doing the field of bone quest, it'd be nice if the other two were in line with this ones difficulty.<P>re: Smithing the pikes - is it possible to have the skill check part removed entirely? It's a really slow and expensive process to become a master smith, and still have a chance of failing. With our below average foraging skill it can take many hours to get some of the foraged components like the radiant meteorite - and these are in high level zones that we can't really fight in to pass the time.. This is probably what keeps most people from doing the quests and none of the other iksar quest have this kind of requirement..<P>There is also the matter of the ornate tin box dropped by the same froglok that drops one of the triplet heads? Is this actually supposed to be there, or is it just a red herring?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt; Memory of Sebilis -&gt; There are actually NPC's that talk about it, and give you hints about who stole them, and also how to get he ruby.. <P>I know about this - but honestly none of these clues (as you mentioned) have anything to do with the end result.  There's -no- way to solve this quest based on the clues, period.<P>How it was solved on test was people found 2 of the gems and someone ID'ed them as a memory of sebilis.  A monk no less, so not even someone doing the quests.<P>I think I was the guy on test who solved the first pike quest actually.. and it wasn't that hard - pretty fun actually.  The pies come from the escorts too (or used to), and I had previously chatted up the pie baker and had gotten his "If you find any weird pies, bring them to me, I'll tell you all about them".<P>I was most definitely one of the first iksar blacksmiths along with someone who was a friend of a GM and was testing the warrior quests for them.<P>The hilarious part is that the GM ended up giving them some quest components, because they -couldn't spend the time- to camp them.  LOL.<P>"This quest is fine, but we don't have time to actually hunt the froglok bounders".  I laugh right through my tears.<P>The geozite tool.  Oh, yes.  The geozite tool.  I have lost more geozite tools than you can possibly imagine.  20?  More?  I've done this quest so many times I think I am going to puke.<P>Worse, the stupid pikes won't fit in a normal bag, so they take up a bank slot (they do fit in a spit, go figger)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Through doing the Iksar warrior quests, I have gotten to know the area surrounding cabilis fairly well, and I appreciate the fact that these quests give you an opportunity to pursue a goal while exploring your surroundings.  <BR>   However, I must post on a few frustrations about the Iksar warrior quests.  I am currently working on the (footman's?) pike quest, where you need the javelins and redwood, etc..  Here are my complaints regarding this quest:<P>1)  The froglok bounder javelins are much too difficult to get for a (level 8?) quest IMHO.  It is not the frogs themselves are that dangerous, but the fact that they: <P>a) flee, and<BR> b) run into the water a LOT, where it is EXTREMELY difficult to pursue them. <BR>     <BR>     I have found that all too often, the froglok will flee, I'll give chase, and after he enters the water I have to wait for him to come back.  This can EASILY happen 4-5 times for one single frog.  Giving chase is hard enough over a high-latency 56k connection, but even on a cable modem or LAN connection, I have yet to sucessfully  pursue a fleeing, swimming mob of ANY kind regardless of the swiftness of my connection.  I am also disgruntled about the frequency that they load the spear, as well as the frequency of the spawns of boundres, but the fleeing into the water is BY FAR the worst part of the collecting items part of this quest.<P>2)  One of the componants that you QUEST for to get is expendable in the forge.  Yes, that accursed geozite tool.  I think this leads to more frustration and tedium than is appropriate for this level of a quest.<P>3)  YOU have to SMITH your pike.  I say again, **YOU** have to smith your pike.  It is a nodrop lore item, so that means any person attempting this quest MUST have put practices and perhaps even money into their smithing skill.  I do not think FORCING people to learn a trade skill to complete quests is a good idea.  Pretty much all the intermediate ingredients for Iksar (not just warrior) quests that I have seen are nodrop, so you cannot hire someone to smith these for you.  I  was planning on becoming a smith anyway, but I was hoping to be able to make money off it.  If all my other lizard brethren are smiths too, my hopes of scraping an income together from smithing  are hosed as well.  PLease, ENCOURAGE players to seek skilled (PC) tradesmen, instead of forcing people to take up skills to complete quests.<P>4)  I have to agree with Nox, the clues and formulae that NPCs give regarding these quests are at best vague, and are sometimes innacurate or downright misleading.  One of the NPCs says if you have the componants you can forge the pike "...if the plans are yours".  What does this mean?  Inventory?  In the forge?  In the bank?  Where do the plans go?  (I know they go in the forge only because I have read posts on other sites by people who have completed the quests)  It seems like the NPC should give a formula that is accurate an unambiguous.<P>Thanks for your time,<P> Zardoz</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The parchment quest works now that you can actually fish the necessary redd out of the Lake of Ill Omen.  However, the blood globules for the ink are NOT currently dropping.  I have hunted all flavers of leech, mosquito, and plant in the swamp, and thus far, NONE of them have dropped the globules.  In fact, the ones above about level 12 only drop coinage, apart from the occasional gold ring from the vines.  Just an FYI.<P>By the way.. PLEASE fix the warrior quests.  I have utterly forgone the replacement of my pike, even though I have had opportunity to get a better (even Magical so I can hunt the insatiables - The pike isn't magical) weapon for purely roleplaying reasons.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">I would LOVE to advance my rank with the Warriors.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This was posted on 9/24 and should be here.  This is the link to the thread.<P>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum3/HTML/002165.html<BR>QUOTE:<BR>Tanrial<BR>Station Member <BR>posted 09-24-2000 08:31 AM            <P>This is referring to the Iksar Warrior quest for the Trooper's Pike, which comes after doing the Soldier's pike quest. The last patch finally put the 3rd froglok head into the game. However, upon completion of the quest,the Warlord gives you plans to make the SOLDIER'S pike! Thats the wrong reward--he is supposed to give you plans to make the TROOPER'S pike. I mean, you have to give him your soldier's pike along with the 3 heads--it makes absolutely no sense. Please fix this! <P>Also, after the patch, I have still not heard anyone say that they have found Froglok Krup Guards (a shield of some sort). This item is needed for the Mancatcher quest which follows the Trooper's pike quest. Could you make sure that Froglok Krup Guards are live, too?<P>Thanks!<BR>Tanrial<BR>A very patient Iksar Warrior...who is starting to run out of patience.<BR>END QUOTE.<P>These two issues are still very previlent as of right now.  PLEASE look at the pike head plans that Warlord in the SWAMP OF NO HOPE.  Also please look at the drops in the SWAMP OF NO HOPE in reguards to Froglok Krup Guard Shields, which are for the Leagonaire Mancatcher Quest.<P>Thanks in Advance<BR>Cokekid78.<P>P.S. Please give us a conformation that this is being looked into so that our nerves can be put at rest.

</FONT><HR>Well, after 8 hours of camping and chasing the accursed traitor twice through Seblis, I finaly had all the components for the first of the pike quests.<P>Excitedly, I handed in my newbie pike, the head of the traitor and the fife.  I got the xp, and the npc said "here is your new pike, yada yada yada"<P>On problem.  No new pike.  It's gone... poof.<P>The only explanation I can come up with is that I had no empty inventory slots on the top lvl.  I took the pike out of my melee slot to hand it in.  I did, however, have plenty of room in the backpacks I was carrying about.<P>What makes this particularly frustrating is that I can not even go back and redo the quest, my pike is gone for good  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Keadaian,<P>Yikes!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/eek.gif"> The pikes are NO DROP, so they won't fall on the ground. They are also size 4, and the only portable container I know they'll fit in is a tailors kit (go figure).<P>In any case, your only recourse now is to /petition a GM. There is a log of all your items, so they can go back and figure out that you had the quest ingredients and you don't know have the pike. The GM should be able to help you, though some GMs might only give you the letter to turn in to the guildmaster to get a new newbie pike.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>Sheesh<BR>35th Iksar Warrior, the Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Followup to the other poster's comment -<P>Many of the quest rewards in the warrior quest weapon sequence are lore/nodrop and go into inventory when awarded instead of onto cursor.<P>This means that if you can't accept the item, you lose it.  This is a problem since, as I mentioned earlier - the entire series of quests is sequential.  Lose the trooper pike (as I did) because base inventory is full and you have lost everything including all quests up to that point.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
