</FONT><HR>Well I know that most of the discussion is aimed at items post 50+ but some weapons for lower levels would be good also. <P>I have been using a Deepwater Harpoon for almost 20 levels now as I have never been able to afford a new 2hs and haven't been lucky enought to get a Ghoulbane.  <P>Maybe I should head to Kunark and try my luck but right now I'm stuck.  Everytime I try to get a GB it is camped (Povar) although I haven't tried recently.  last time the guys camping were trying to get 13 of them.  Now this brings up another point which I should probably add in another thread but....this is a quest item and Paladin only.

</FONT><HR>I think Abashi's response is the best one I've seen on this issue.  He specifically acknowledged both the scarcity of paladin-specific weapons and (more important in my eyes) the correct reason for wanting paladin-specific weapons: the dual-wield issue.<P>That demonstrates to me that he did indeed read the whole thread and got the correct gist of it.<P>We can only hope that the designers will agree and add in some more paladin specific weapons, and even more hopefully, they will be of varying types to finally give (sorry, forgot your name) his holy axe.<P>I am a warrior and there are lots of really cool warrior-usable and warrior-specific weapons.  I have paladin friends and I think it would be great if they had the same quantity and quality of selection.  It's just more fun, and allows you to personalize your character somewhat, so that you aren't yet another ghoulbane swinger, or ykesha dual wielder.  For example, I have always wanted my character to be using spears, but until Wurmslayer there just weren't any high quality spears that a warrior could use.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>nope, I did my research just fine, I am talking about weapons that 50+ would use, mithril staff is a level 35 weapon, shimmering partisan and viik's dark defender are level 40 weapons, if they are counted then ghoulbane is a level 60 weapon. Warriors don't get 1 "good" warrior only weapon from kunark that they'd actually use, however paladins get sword of the morning which is their best 1hs, rangers get lupine dagger, SKs get MotSS, bards get a ton of good 1handers, but real warrior only options are non existant.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I've seen two arguments for giving Paladins more class-specific weapons.  One I agree with.  The other gives me some concern.<P>The first is an economic argument.  Paladins having to compete for generic weapons and the basic laws of suppl and demand mean that Paladins pay higher prices for good weapons.  This argument is sensible and for this reason I agree with paladins.<P>The other argument, that Paladins need class-specific 1 hand weapons because the generic weapons are made for dual wielders and hence aren't "powerful enough" for Paladins gives me concern.<P>It seems to me that if Paladins want to do more damage than the current 1hs weapons provide, then they can use a 2hs weapon.  "But then they can't wield a shield, you say, and will give up a lot of AC".  Yes that's right.  That's the tradeoff they make.  After all, isn't that basically the same argument many Paladins made to Rangers?  That if we wanted to avoid aggro problems with mobs post-50 that we should cripple our class purpose of damage output by wielding inferior 2hs weapons or even [shudder] equip shields (disregarding for a moment that the 2hs tactic doesn't work)?  Well applying the same argument, if Paladins want to become more offense oriented then they should not expect to be able to maintain their class purpose of being a defensive hybrid.  As many Paladins derisively told Rangers, "You can't have your cake and eat it too".  So pick one:  Defense with shield and 1hs weapon, or offense with 2hs weapon without the shield.<P>So giving Paladins class-specific 1 hand weapons that are not much better (if at all) than current generic 1-hand weapons would address the valid economic arguments made and I certainly would support that.  However, giving Paladins class-specific 1 hand weapons whose damage approximates that of 2hs weapons would present real class-balance issues.<P>Balerius<BR>Outrider<BR>Rodcet Nife  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Just an observation. How quickly things change, eh? I also remember enchanters crying about "not have a decent pet or any good nukes."

</FONT><HR>One thing Abashi, that may be true for Pre ROK, but can you expect 50+ people to use sub 50 weapons?  It is a clean slate for post 50, doesn't matter what we had pre 50.  That said Paladins need more 1handers that can compete with the likes of Ebon Mace.  You do realize that Ebon Mace is the best weapon in the game other than the monk only weapons and the twig.  19 24 to our 16 27 is a LARGE difference in effectiveness.  The only other that comes close is 19 27 from a Plane of Sky quest that has been completed once out of 6+ months of work.  I don't think I need to explain the risk reward fubar of something that can be gotten by 6 people in an afternoon (ebon Mace) being better than something that has been gotten once by 30+ people doing Sky over and over and spending months to get, Zephyrwind.  Paladins deserve to have weapons that can compete and the risk reward is comparable to the results.  Just because there are more Paladins than SKs, doesn't mean balancing the numbers of played classes by not giving one weapons is OK.<P>Thanks for looking into this Abashi.<P>Salerdar Sanctus 56 Knight<BR>Cunnan's Brewing Co.<BR>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Warriors should be able to master all weapons, HOWEVER, there is not one RP reason why a weapon is Warrior only.  There are paladin, sk, and ranger only weapons because the gods/goddesses want them to be.  No divine power is going to grant an item to its basic worshipers but deny it to their elite.<P>Am I the only one that sees this?<P>And there are 13 warrior only weapons released in Kunark that people have found.<P>Why doesn't a 50 plus warrior use the Felhammer?

</FONT><HR>OK people, I feel your pain about being left out of the expansion and all, but consider this, and consider it well:<P>Where would all these Pally wepons on Kunark come from?  The island was ruled by the Iksar, who have no Pallys, only SKs and warriors.  Then the Dragons came, no Pallys there either to be certain.  Then, according to the fiction, the Trolls were major inhabitants, still no Pallys, again SKs and warriors.  The continent was only recently discovered by the good races, so there is only a very limited leak of fictional high-level NPC Pallys to die and leave their weapons around, and Pallys aren't really the type to be doing the scouting anyway, that's the Ranger's job.  Face it, from a background standpoint it makes alot more sense that the SKs and Rangers have alot more weapons scattered around Kunark than the Pallys.<P>I don't dispute that the Pallys got a bit ripped in the class specific weapon department, but maybe the designers were actually following a logical storyline in not having alot of them?  Hence the great many of the weapons they added were not only usable by paladins, but would be far more appropriate for them than the other classes that can use them (Arbitors Combine Greatsword, Argent Defender, Jade Inlaid Crescent Axe, Runed Blade, Ornate Rune Blade, Green Jade Broadsword, Fayguard Bladecatcher, Sword of Skyfire, Stave of Shielding, Warding Star, Ringed Mace of the Ykesha, all great weapons that Pallys can use, and I truncated the list consideably).  I think this is what the designers had in mind, and it was a bit short-sighted of them, to be sure.<P>Should Pally get more class specific weapons to balance things a bit?  Yeah, probably.  But should they be just dropped of some creature in Kunark?  No.  It desn't make sense.  Give them a quest to forge one from some evil that can be turned to the side of good.  Have it given to them by an NPC in FV in trade for some other item.  But don't just give it to some ancient evil who never would have encountered a pally before.  This IS an RPG after all, not a FPS, and the world must have a coherent history in order to RP in it well.<P>OK, rant over.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Beldukil, I am a bit confused:<P>1. What do you mean "meant for dual wield"?  Last time I chacked, a fast, mid damge weapon was eqivalent, if not superior to, a slower, high damage 2-handed weapon.  Especially if there is a proc involved, since the % chance to proc happens with each attempted hit ,and a fast weapon has more attempts.  More hits also means more chances to interrupt casters.  How does this make a weapon strictly "meant for dual wield"?  None of the 1H weapons I listed has a ratio about on average with most high level 2H weapons in the game.  Find a nice shield and go 1H for Tunare's sake, and stop immediately qualifying any weapon that is 1H as "meant for dual wield".  Jaut because a warrior can use 2 of them doesn't make it inferior, that's just why warrior are the best tanks (and have to rely on healers after the fight).<P>2.  Sure there are a thousand things that don't make sense from a RP aspect.  But Kunark was a chance to start over and make some effort towards remedying that.  Look at what they have done there in regards to background; Dalnir's crypt has enough story and thinking behind it to make a decent paper RPG adventure, and the quest to get the keys for Sebilis does as well.  Verant is honestly, seriously trying to put the RP back into this MMRPG.  The fact that mose players don't care is what made all the changes to the original game, and Kunark's stories will all be mucked up by them as well before long, no doubt.<P>3.  I missed the story about the HE Pally.  What is his name, and where is the story?  I'd love to read it.<P>I don't mean to offend by any of this, but you seem so caught up in your cause that you are dismissing alot of ideas that are valid.  Take a step back, and look at what is available to you now, since even if they DO fix the drops, it will be a while, probably a LONG while.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Almost all Paladin only equipment requires a great number of people to aquire! The quests for Ro armor is extremely hard to get at any level where it would be of use! As well as the Soul fire! But there are quest for other classes that are just as hard or worse!

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>DalAren:  A good post; I completely agree with you about Paladins questing being an important part of the class.  As to why the froggy has Ghoulbane, presumably a Pally went to Guk at some point and died with it.  Sad part is that the Frogloks in Guk are non-aggro, and you have to start slaughtering them to get a holy sword.  That idea always bugged me.<P>Bedukil: The only part of the damage/delay formula that I am unclear on is the difference between the damage bonus as applied to 1H vs. 2H weapons.  I have heard several different formulas, and Verant has stated that they are not going to confirm any more statistical information about the game, so we'll never know for sure how it factors in. The most common theory is (LVL-25/3) for 1H and (LVL-25/2 for 2H).  This means that in order to even out the damage bonus at level 50, a 1H weapon must do 9.3 more points of damage than a 2H does in the same period.  This does, indeed create a deficit, as the ratios of the uber-2H weapons are often equal to or even slightly higher than the uber-1H ones.<P>There are other things to consider in this debate, however, than simple damage delt:<P>First is the point that at level 25+, even a fully-stacked warrior cannot come close to dishing it out like an uninterrupted Wizard can; at this point tanks have to resign themselves to being little more than bait to keep the casters clear.  An extra couple dozen points of damage per hit is neglibible compared to the Ice Comet that got interrupted because taunt didn't work and your weapon didn't recycle fast enough to draw the focus back to you from the caster.<P>Second, if a weapon has a good proc, a faster cycle time can seriously upgrade the damage (Skyfire on a halfling warrior with lots of dex items can easily deal an extra 500+ damage per combat from procs alone!).  If this is the case take after the warriors and carry DEX enhancing items, to improve the chance of a proc.<P>Third, using a shield allows you to bash without having to Ghetto Bash.  This is a good way to raise your attack rate and chance for an interrupt and stun (without the chance for a mis-timing and losing an attack when ghetto bashing).  There are also some really nice shields out there now (albeit not as many as there probably should be), and most players will let you loot them since not many classes are interested in them due to the obsession with 2H weapons, and warriors dual wielding.<P>If you want to be a tank, you have to get in there and hit as fast and often as possible to keep the casters from harm.  I don't know of many good tanks who give a rat's behind about how much damage they do (there's always a caster that pipes in and shuts them up); what they care about is how fast they hit, and how long they can last face to face with a formidable foe.  The glory of a kill belongs to the group, and tanks make it possible for the group to survive long enough to get the kill.<P>OK, I'm just meandering around the topic now, so I'll shut up.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>BTW, where can I find the story of Edril?  I try to read whatever background I can so my bard character can seem that much more sage  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
