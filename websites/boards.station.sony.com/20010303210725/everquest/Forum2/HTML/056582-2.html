</FONT><HR>OH - I forgot to put my contructive stuff in - but let me reiterate: DO NOT NERF EVADE the way you were planning.  Your players are talling in detail why your solutions are a Bad Idea and will Screw Up Your World Now(TM).<P>1) Fix the color of the mega-armor.  Its very un-rogue-ish to look like Homey D. Clown in those bright bannana colors.<P>2) Up the limits on Safe Fall to 120.  This makes it valuable without infringing on the Monks title of "Kings of Damage Avoidance".<P>3) Make throwing worth while (maybe extending and closing the range as we go up in skill).<P>4) Do NOT give us a mask for each race - but DO give us one for each "PVP team" - we have Eru for the humans, DE for the dark races, Iksar for the leezardzzz, allegedly there is a Hi Elf one for the elves.  So we only should get one or two more masks - for the small races, and the large races.  <P>Make it a gnome for the smalls and toss a coin between Ogre and Troll for the large (I'd prefer Troll).  If you only want to give ONE of those masks, make it the Gnome.  Maybe make the small race a low 30's quest, and the large one a low 40's quest.<P>I hope you are still reading and listening.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Guys, calm down.<BR>We haven't seen how the Evade change works yet, so what's the panic? Instead of yelling (yet), try adding suggestions to the what can improve and fix what is broken with the class, and our skills. And when you do, try reading and researching first.<P>Stackable poisons: Poison is programmed unlike any other item in EQ. It simply cannot be stacked. Hopefully it can be made into charges, like shaman potions...<P>Hide/sneak past zone: This would take hard programming, and Verant have earlier stated that they don't find the effect worth doing it. I don't miss it much.<P>Assassin armor is possible to tint though. Put the designers sore feelings aside and make our wish come through. Why do you think the ninja is black and not shining gold?<P>"Crit hit" backstab messages may have upsides and downsides.

</FONT><HR>Dont nerf evade - as to those who say "wait and see", you are wrong.  There are those who have been playing rogues a lot of hours, and those who have been rogues a long time, and those who are both.  They all agree that the proposed (or is that IMPOSED?) changes will damage the viability of the class severely, especially at thigher levels and in multiple group or large raids.<P>  <BR>Absor, please draw on the resources you have: Hundreds of players who intimately know and enjoy playing the class.  Come read the Safehouse for compelling disproof of the effectiveness of Absor's proposed changes.   And come read there for some great prposed solutions that address Absor's concerns.  Listen to the players, and at least respond with a "Yes IM reding, keep posting" update.  The players can help you more that your design and programming staff on this.  This is one case where the users DO know more than the programmers - because this is not a word processor or a web page, its a dynamic environment with some fixed rules that interact with other rules and live players.  Its a chaotic system that produces unexpected results - meaning your best soruce is those who experience the results - the players.  <P>What works on test or happened on a development server will not always be indicative of what happens in the real game.  Dont the mistakes from almost every patch tell you this?  There are many instances of unanticipated consequences that have ocurred:  Heres a good example Alchemy was broken for many months - Verant thought it wasn't and turns out that the Players were right all along.  This is another case where the players "en toto" actually know more about the probable end effects than the staff.<P>In light of all that, your best thing to do is DO NOTHING! If you still feel the need to reduce the evade from being put on the bottom of the hate list, ask the people who know the class intimately for a solution.  Here is one I heard:<P>Try inserting them into the middle - not the top 3, not at the bottom.  That would likely maintain the effectiveness of the Evade (which still does not work all that often), and address your concerns about oddities that happen in theory  when the rogue goes to the bottom of a 60 player hate list.  <P>In reality, if you are truthful with yourself, you will realize that you have presented NO evidence to prove that your example actually happens to any extent that it affects the game on a live server.  You're solving a problem that doesnt exist - like applying Chemotherapy and Radiation when theres no cancer.  Stop it.  All the other classes are getting improvments and discussing which ones they get, while the rogues are ALL battling a NERF.  <P>Be fair.  This class works well as is, for solo at lower levels, and they require a group at med-hi levels.  Rogues have a well defined role, they play it well and interact with the other classes fitting in a unique set of strenghts and weaknesses that make them a valuable member of groups and of large raids.  They can participate in Raids and big-mob combat as damage makers, but tend to die more often than the other melee classes.  High reward, higher risk.  They dont replace any other class, they work well with all the other ones.  Sounds to me like they are balanced now.<P>Bottom Line: Rogues are not broken, and the most requested changes are mainly surface ones, not fundamental ones; a resonable observer would conclude Rogues are fine as they are.  <P>DO NOT FIX IF ITS NOT BROKEN.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just a slight clarification.<BR>IMO there is one class that can get to the top of the list just as fast as a rogue can (mabye faster?) -- that is a Wiz. Try chaincasting ice comet on a mob and see how fast we climb the hate list. Our solution? cast once on the mob and wait a LONG time before we contribute to the fight again. Sometimes it is as bad as casting twice during a fight, and risking the fact that the mob will wander over and pummel you into the ground in under 3 seconds. Wait... there's  concussion you say!!!! A spell that requires a group of 50+ buddies to get, and even then it's hard. Quite a few wizzies don't have this option ...<P>And as for being the ONLY class that can get waxed by a green.... think again. Yup wizzes again. If a green pops next to us and aggros on us before we can get a root/snare off on it (and we haven't had the fortune to be sowed or have jboots - both artificial solutions to the problem) that little green can interrupt every spell we try to get off and nickel and dime us to death without us having done a single point of damage to it. Sounds incredible, but it is VERY possible, particularly at lower levels.<P>That being said I DO NOT agree that you rogues should be nerfed in this manner, but if the nerf does go through, talk to your wizz friends about how they deal with aggro, because you're about to become a wiz with a knife.<P>Frustrated wiz. (hmm wiz talk part NINE anyone?)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>So, you increased the size of the hate list of a mob with expansion(s), thus making evade more effective, thus granting a nerf - fair enough.<P><BR>Make evade drop a rogue to the position #&lt;old hate list size&gt;. This will make evade work, "as intended" when it was designed.<P><BR>As an alternative:<BR>- instant refresh on hide(evade)<BR>- decrease nimble recycle to 10 mins (5 at lvl 60)<BR>- additional defence disc at lvl 60, weaponshield equivalent for rogues (parry all frontal attacks for &gt;20 secs). We are better than rangers in damage avoidance aren't we?<P>#3 or 500 points drop ain't gonna cut it. I can easy double stab for 1000+ with my epic and proper buffs at 60, not to mention regular pierce/slash/blunt damage.<P>One more thing to keep in mind is you are nerfing warrior's defencieve - they will do less damage under this disc now, making it even harder for rogues to evade.<P><BR>Karabas - the Assling of Valon<BR>Terris-Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

He has YET, in 4 FULL threads about this, to respond to our concerns about the Evade nerf.  Not a SINGLE line.<P>Absor, we've explained patiently that evade does not do what you think it does.  You've said nothing.  We've pleaded with you to reconsider.  You've said nothing.  We've given examples and even logs SHOWING you that Evade does not work as you think it does.  You've said nothing.  We've asked you not just to take our word for it, but to try it yourself.  You've said NOTHING.<P>I suppose in the grand scheme of things, Rogues make up such a SMALL percentage of your players that we really make no difference to the overall population in Everquest.  But I must say, it's bloody poor business sense to IGNORE any customers at all.  You're supposed to be the Customer Service Representative.  And yet, you ignore our MAJOR concerns and talk about minor details that really are unimportant compared to the BOMB you dropped on us.  Why are you ignoring our concerns?  Why don't you at LEAST post that you understand that we're concerned?  Why can you NOT believe the hundreds of rogues who tell you you're WRONG about evade?  Why don't you TEST the bloody evade as it is now rather than make a spurious change?<P>Absor, SHOW US that you actually give a damn about what we say!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1) Make poison worthwhile to use. At high level i can see no reason to waste my time making poison. It gets resisted WAY too much, and to carry enough poison to make it finally stick on something i have to fill up all my bags with poison.<P>- Please lower the resistance of poisons by the higher lvl mobs. <BR>Poison gets resisted so much it is just frustrating and isn't even a fun skill to use in its present form except for dueling or PvP.<P>- Please make poisons stackable. If my rogue was making poison, it would make sense that he could make an extra strong batch of the poison that has multiple uses.<P>- Give Backstab a message like critical hits to show how much damage it does. I still don't understand why this isn't already in the game. If a healer sees me hit a huge backstab (and understands my evade is now nerfed) he can start watching my health more closely. This is important to me because it sounds like with your new evade im going to die fast.<P>- High Elf Mask quest should be in the game.

</FONT><HR>I do not have many balance concerns with the Rogue class. I do think nerfing Evade would be a drawback and is likely to be the death of many rogues just because there will be little way to escape the wrath of a very angry mob you have been backstabbing over and over again. I understand the need for balance but I also do not think that many Rogues are going to want to lay off attacking and backstabbing a few rounds in order for their Evade skill to be of any use because it is less effective. <P>I think that if you want to do something for Rogues as a class and yes I know this is not as much a class balance issue as a gripe for the Rogue class, make our poison skill useful. In its current state like most trade skills it costs thousands of platinum to perfect but unlike many other trade skills its usefulness is very little. <BR>Yes you can argue that it is useful when your skill is up to a high level but to reach the level where it is effective you are going to spend a huge amount of platinum and at that time unless you have a financial backer in game you are going to be high level and the monsters you are attempting to use the poison on will either resist the poison or it will be totally useless due to the feeble amount of damage or effect it has.<P>In my opinion and only in my opinion I think if you want to help us as a class please consider reworking our poison making skills like you did Alchemy do that it is a more useful skill for us.<P>Do that and I could live with our Evade skill getting nerfed.<P>Just my opinions nothing more.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Myamoshi<BR>I have played a rogue for 18 months, EQ for 20. I have 90 days played and have lived to level 40ish without evade. Verant is not intending to make the class suck. They intend to change the code behind the skill (which may or may not be a waste of resources, because it undoubtly works now...) I'm not even sure most rogues would have noticed if they implemented it without telling us. One of the best players in the EQ team plays a rogue (hehe), and I think I can trust him not to kill the class.<P>We are not the only class dying from greens. I have witnessed level 50 warriors die from dervishes in Iceclad, and have myself saved a 52 paladin from the same fate. Wizards have more chances to survive than the war/rog/pal.<P>People may agree or disagree with the evade change, my point is, that there are other things we would like to see/see get fixed, isn't it? Don't let a change we haven't even seen happen yet occupy 70% of the debate.<P>I would like to see a robe for gnome rogues only <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I realize that you dont' intend evade to become the priamry target of this thread, but evade has become one of the top 3 class defining abilities for the rogue (Backstab, hide+sneak, Evade).  Something like this would be equivelent ot makeing sneak+hide break likie inviz, or backstabs do half as much damage.  My suggestion for evade is this: If the rogue is #1 on the hate list, just drop him to #3, as per the original idea, however, if the rogue is not #1, drop him MUCH lower (Maby it works like current evade, maby puts him at close to bottom of hate list, up to you, but make an evade when not at the top much more effective than one at top).  This IMO is a great way to make rogues "accountable" for their damage.  If a rogue aggros any mob too much, he will need 10 seconds at least before he can start fully laying into said mob once again. From an RP standpoint, this makes a lot more sense than any kind of flat evade.  A mob who has been beating on a rogue will not forget him much when he ducks away from his vision.  A mob that hasn't been beating on a rogue for some time is likely to forget about him a lot more.<P>other points:<BR>2h Piercers: I think these are about as infiesable as the spears that many rogues wield, and so would be worthwhile to see ingame.  I think that 2hpiercing would add a little flavor to the rogue class, and would probably help keep damage up and hate down (slower weapon=less hate)<P>-Hirosaki</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Didn't think I'd be adding my 2cp to this discussion, but after hearing about the change to evade, I feel I should.<P>I have not seen the effect described by Absor while playing my rogue.  I often am top on the hate list VERY quickly.  Then, when I've had a successful evade, I am back on the top of the list within seconds of attacking again, often without even making a backstab.  I haven't seen anyone mention it, but I believe Pick Pocket also puts you higher on their hate list.  So, if you are attacking, back stabbing, and pick pocketing, you end up top on their list a LOT.  If the evade changes, I fear I will NEVER be off the top of their hate list.<P>I will also have to second (well, probably more like 45th now) the call for stackable poisons.  Why weren't these made stackable when the shaman potions were?  I believe I read that this couldn't be done without more coding, and thus you are reluctant to do it.  Does this mean that Rogues are less important that you will fix the same type of problem for another class and not for rogues?<P>I have just now been able to start using poison with my rogue, but I have heard that when you apply poison, it lasts until you zone, but only "procs" once.  IF this is true (like I said, I don't know that it is), it would be nice to have it stay around until one zones or logs.  Otherwise, poison is just too expensive for the good it does. (I've been able to get poison once, and it failed on apply).<P>When they are facing you and you hit the backstab button, does it still continue to increase you on their hate list?  Does it then act like a taunt?<P>Well, that's just my 2cp.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think a good thing to add to the Rogue class would be more running/movement speed(ie run faster than others)  I'm not saying faster than SoW or Bard speed.  Just quicker than normal and gradually goes up as you level.  I just picture the Rogue class as one based off of speed in combat and noncombat situations.  Not only swinging your weapons fast, but moving fast to(ninja/tomb raider/any rogue-thief type).

</FONT><HR>I believe Evade should not be changed, due to it's success rate (less than 50%), and factors that will interrupt it, such as moving or getting hit. Also it does not work quite like you have outlined it. a mob has never ran away from me to attack someone else like a caster after a successful evade. That caster would be pounded if he moved into melee range of the mob, but casters have enough sense not to do that. Also, a mob will not ever attack someone who is not on the hate list after I evade it, no matter how close that other person is. Sometimes even after a successful evade, the mob will continue to attack me and not the tank.<P>If evade is changed then the success rate should be increased (by skill level perhaps), and should not be interrupted by movement and/or enemy hits.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>While my personal concerns about the evade change will be held in reservation until I can actually test it myself (have to wait for it to go live as I dont play on the Test), I would like to voice some of my suggestions.<P>1.)  Poisons - First, I can see the problem with poisons.  Most of the suggestions I have seen are make poisons stackable or make them charged.  Well I have a differnt suggestion.  Change the way poisons work fundamentaly.  Basically, what I purpose (and forgive me if this has already been said) is to basically make poisons like a potion.  When "applied" it gives you a buff that functions like the proc spells help by other classes (sk life taps, the upper level ranger snare proc, ect.) but it is very short lived.  In this way it should allow you to make charged posion potion-esqe items.  As well as completely bypassing current problems with stackable poisons, it allows a greater variety of effects that you could add.  Now I realize that it is unlikely that any implementation like this would occur, and it does purpose its own set of problems with max number of buffs ect., just thought I'd put it on the table.<P>2.)  Soul Bound Lock-picks - I think this is a great idea to provide a rogue with a "fun stuff" item that provides no real over powering advantage that I can tell.  Though I'd prefer not to see this implemented until the soul bound "key-ring" or bag has been implemented.<P>3.)  Pick Pocket - Not really something I've seen suggested, but how bout an indicator message to the effect of "That creature doesn't appear to have any pockets to pick!" when a mob has no viable pick pocketable items.<P>4.)  Apply Poison - I love the new ideas for apply poison.  However providing apply posion for other melee experts like Rang, Pally, War, and SK could be interesting.  Though would be made even more intesting if the previous idea for poisons were made live.  It would provide and interesting revenue choice for the resourceful rogue, and allow lower level melee characters soem fun when they cant get thier hands on a procing weapon.  This would, of course, have to be made with some built in level limits on the activation level of the items.  <P>5.)  Disguise - This is mostly jsut a fluff idea I've been mulling over.  How bout (assuming you put in the Illusion: Sex spell for chanters) a Disguise Kit that has activatable illusion: sex.  Being master of disguise, wouldn't it be in our benifit to be able to assume the fairer sex, or atleast the one most appropriate to the situation  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>6.)  Backstab Message - It would be quite nice if this was made to be a critical announcement style message.  As it would allow classes whom have to keep battlespam as low as possible to see when trouble could be brewing.  As well, it would allow the main tank to know when to start working extra hard on keeping the rogue alive.<P>7.)  Midlevel weapons that dont make me look like captain Ahab - Any chance we will see a weapon that has a comparable damage/delay and aquastion range as the Slime Coated Harpoon that isnt a harpoon.  Something a lil more roguely like a rapier or one of the new punch daggers would be nice. <P>Well thats about it from me.  The fact of the matter is I really enjoy my rogue and think that hes dam near perfect.  Most of my suggestions have very little to do with balance, and much more to do with fun.  Thats because....well....rogues a just right  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  <P>Terribly sorry if I covered things that were already covered, if I did do so I hope I atleast brought some new light and my own perspective to it.<P>45th Testosterone Over-Producing Circus Midget<BR>(thats Halfling for all you non sciency types)<BR>Of Lanys,<BR>Hideakin Tinyfeet.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR> I think it was Absor who mentioned something about a rogue evading and a mob going back across an entire zone to attack someone else. This does need fixing.  <BR> I have evaded before and a mob has gone after someone else , (who was on its hate list too) which coincidently was making his way across the zone. I really don't think that is much of the problem. The major problem is when evading, the creature perceeds to the others on its hate list and randomly attacks people on the way (solb bats) which were not on its hate list. I can see why this needs fixed, but it should be done without putting rogues in damnation. Evade is the perfect tool to save rogues, but it does have flaws.(Not to mention it doesn't freaking work half the time successful or not).<P>On my list I would like to see:<P>Critical Hit backstab messages<BR>Stunning backstabs (2-5 seconds)<BR>New Assassins Armor look<BR>Longer discipline durations<BR>Something rewarding for being Human(exp bonus=not there)<BR>Lower delays for throwing daggers with level<BR>Soul Bound lockpick quest <BR>Frontal "backstab" damage increase<BR>Instill Doubt skill increase<BR>Throwing Discipline<P>And last but not least:<BR>more health points<P>Xakia<P><BR>Doh, must not forget to add:<BR>Fix the Mrylokar Gloves drop!

</FONT><HR>My rogue was my first character to pass lvl 26 and I didn't pass it with another till after my rogue was 49, my rogue's current level in fact.  I only mention that because my rogue is 100% untwinked.  I also don't belong to a large guild so I don't have a very good chance of ever seeing my epic.  All this means is that my rogue is one of very modest equipment.  Despite that fact, I get much more than my fair share of attention from mobs.  The only time I've not been one of the first to die on raids is when there are plenty of rangers or better equipped (weapons) rogues along.   The evade nerf needs to have an extended testing time on the test server to say the least.  Just last night I was fighting crystaline wurms with a full group composed of a 52 wizard, 55 necro, 51 pally, another pally (44ish), and another rogue (about 46 or 47 I think).  When the necro was doing plenty of damage, the wiz and I were just fine, as soon as he slacked off in doing damage, all my successful evades didn't do a thing, not even for a moment.  The poor pallys were getting cleric spots on their butts from the extra meditating they had to do for me.  This scenario is typical of my experiences as a rogue.  If I'm not dwarfed by someone in the group doing damage (which means my exp is being slowed due to much higher levels in group) then I'm gonna be a mana sponge.  I agree that evade needs tweaking, but it needs to work better not worse.  I have yet to see any mob I fight take off on me after I've successfully evaded.  Go ahead and keep the extra long hate list, but whoever tunes this nerf needs to spend a few weeks making it work properly on test before they unleash it on rogues live.<P>I've noticed a bit of clamor for more illusion masks.  I would like to see this as well but please make them no drop, ALL of them.  I really don't have the pp to go around paying for so much armor, weapons AND the class items that should be questable or no drop.  I would like to see just a high elf added.  Perhaps it is already in game but it is obviously extremely tough to get since no one has reported it.  BTW, I think there already is a gnome mask in the game, I recall seeing one on a loot pic by a well known guild.....it was looted in Sleeper's Tomb of all places....guess I won't be getting one of them either.  AS imbalancing as it would be to have all those gnomes running around, I still think this and the masks for erudite and iksar illusion should be about the same difficulty to get as mask of deception.  How about Iksar in Kaesora, gnome in Tower of Frozen Shadow, Erudite in Paw or maybe one of the new Odus zones (if they are midlevel) and High Elf in Mistmoore.  That would round out the masks for teams and all those zones have at least some degree of RP sense.<P>The only other issue I see as needing balancing is poisons.  There's too many that give buffs too strong for the debuffing they do, perhaps tone down the buffs just a bit.  Stacking is the major issue however.  Between keeping stacks of arrows or throwing implements, food and water, extra gear for situational fighting setting up a couple packs for situational poisoning is just too much.  Its especially bad during the combining process with all the components.  I understand there are coding issues.  Ok, then take the time needed to recode it, but please do it.  Mostly,  they work very nicely and add more to the class but they're just too cumbersome to use as more than a novelty at this time.  I don't understand why they can't be made to stack at this time since they have buff effects as well as debuff effects, just as some shaman potions do.  If you wish to argue that the space it takes is the price you must pay for the ability, look again at the time it takes to gather only half the components for any one poison and the pp we pay to vendors for the other half of the components.<P>Other than the poison stacking, my rogue has been a lot of fun to play, I just hope the fun continues for a good long time yet.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1. Make Ravenscale no drop<P>2. Throwing weapons have little to no use except to those who are hard-core roleplayers. Spending any time modifying this is time that could be put to better use.<P>3. I understand the need to change the way evade works due to the changes in the hate list. You could offset some of this "nerf" by increasing the effectiveness of evade and/or lowering the recycle time. A lower recycle time appeals to me by allowing a rogue to more quickly move their way down the hate list by using the skill prior to actually engaging the mob in combat.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well brothers and sister rogues, <BR>     I fear that the time of our nerfing is imminent.  With under 5% of the entire population being rogues, we won't get the attention that, say the Druid or Wizard class will.   We have had to make due, and I mean struggle, with every ability that we have been given.<P>Sense Traps?  BAH!  Disarm Traps?  Double BAH!  And Evade?  How many times have we died when the puller couldn't taunt the mob off of us, or worse, the puller FD.<P>And then we can pick locks too!  Yeah!  But only after spending 40 hours in Befallen to get that skill up to an acceptable level (140+).<P>And when was the last time your heard of a rogue actually acquring all of his RS armor on his own!  BAH, I SAY!  Doesn't happen.  We can't get to it, due to way that it drops and is heavily camped.  Verant, if you want Rogues to have armor, perhaps add a new armor in one of the other 30ish zones.<P>But, in the end, I am sure a nerf is coming.  We already are well aware that tech/customer support is horrid.  So Verant I say to you.....<P>....either listen to your players or go the way of the Macintosh as we run like lemmings to the new MMORPG offerings(such as AO, Neverwinter Nights, etc.)  due out later in the year.<P>Just a frustrated 2cp.<BR>Graey</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>  I have yet to actually get evade, but I have a friend who plays a Rogue that got me interested in this class.  From second hand experience I can sum up this entire argument quite simply:  If you are going to go with what you have planned for Evade (which will drop its effectiveness to ZERO, mind you) then you must do one of the following three things.  1. Allow Rogues to wear Plate Armor, change all piercing weapons to higher damage, give us more hit points, make backstab stronger, and make our poison and magic resists MUCH higher.  2. Eliminate the Rogue class from the game.  3. Prepare yourselves to lose a lot of players.<BR>  Presently, the Rogue class is perfectly balanced.  Changing ANYTHING for the worse will make this class useless.  Groups won't want us and we still won't be able to solo much of anything.  The way things are, this class is useful in groups and they are fun to play.<BR>  In a slightly off-topic remark, what would be wrong with getting all of the classes to where the majority of their players are happy with them and just leaving class modifications alone?  I know that's what you're shooting for, but how can it ever be achieved if non-issue modifications are made (such as changing Evade)?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Okay I felt I need to intervene.  It seems that a lot of people don't quite understand how evade works (I didn't until very recently)<P>When you use evade, your hate drops to 120 pts.  Regardless of what it is.  If I remember correct a standard attack causes 50-500 points of hate (check? This doesnt quite fit in, but I believe I saw it on one of kendrick's posts, 500 hate from 1 attack seems ludicrous since jolt reduces hate by 500) The failure rate on evade is 33% If my reading is correct (Poss. a quote from kendrick also).<P>For those of you who claim you get attacked instantly after you use evade, I have had this happen as well, but ONLY at the beginning of a fight: Why? Most rogues engage, get aggroed and quickly evade dropping them to 120 hate with everyone else fairly low.  As soon as the mob turns, said rogue will backstab and the mob will turn back onto them.  The longer you wait to use evade the more effective it is. The problem with the current evade is that if you know what youre doing, rogues will NEVER get hit 30 seconds after the onset of a battle.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>On evade...while I think that it dropping us to 120 is excessive, I think that dropping us between 2 and 3 on the hate list is not enough. If you have several rogues you will be swapping the top 3 spots, and as for a flat 500 point reduction thats nothing, a level 60 rogue can BS for that amount, and double backstab about 50% of the time, not to mention our weapons are generally better then warriors(arguable) and we are looking at the mobs back which negates there riptose/dodge/parry(assuming things are going right), this all adds up to us doing MUCH MORE then 500 damage more then a warrior every 8 seconds(not counting failed evades). So we will end up tanking or backing out of combat. <P>Therefor I propose you scale evade make the flat reduction be 500 at level 50 and 3000 at level 60.. yes 3000. This makes sure we can keep agro on the tanks.<P>Other issues:<P>Sneak/Hide across zone boundaries<P>Sneak/Hide in water..it doesnt make sense that I can creep right under a mob and he cant see me, yet in the gloomy oceon, where visibility would be in question, I cant even attempt to Sneak. Along with this increase our movement rate for Sneak/Hide in water should scale from 50-60 like it does for dry land.<P>Throwing weapons. Make a ueber drop(or quest) for an item that summons a GOOD throwing weapon for us.  With maxed throwing I can Deadly strike for 50ish damage, or I can use my bow of the Icepaw, with non maxed archery, and hit for 50 damage the majority of the time... it simply makes no sense.<P>It would also be nice if we could Range slot RB again.. there are alot of great weapons for rogues that we will never use simply beacuse we cant afford to loose the haste + stats of RB.<P>Gobs</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
