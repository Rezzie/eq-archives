</FONT><HR>Wrong to complain, maybe not -- but certainly naive if you expect your complaint to have impact.  Or if you expected anything other than this.  There will be level 50's with in a month and at least a couple twinks around.  By 2 months twinkage will be common.  Same thing happened last time they added servers and there were 2 fresh start servers at that time.  If you can't deal with it then yeah, you may as well go home to your old server.  First people to level are the only ones who get to hunt in uncrowded areas -- rest of us get to deal with 50 to 100 + in most commons zones, just the way it is.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Why do you care?<P>Its my game, let me play it  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I so very much understand the concerns people have over a so-called uber guild taking over prime camps on the server.  My advise is not to worry about it.  There simply is not enough population on the server to allow for such a guild.  Any guild that tries is likely to fall on its face having tried to plant its feet too far apart.<P>Leveling as fast as possible is a peculiar obseesion for some.  I certainly dont recommend it for most.  It is grueling, tiresome work for those not played by 3 or 4 peeps.  At 40 in 2 and a half weeks my nerves are shot my eye sunk into my head and Ive had to take out a second morgage to pay for all the Mtn. Dew Im drinking.  But, Im enjoying myself and as far as i can tell not affecting anyone elses game in a negative way.<P>Some peeeps play EQ to roleplay; some play to explore each and every facet of the game; and others play just to hang out with friends.<P>Kickback and relax.  Enjoy EQ in the way you like to best and please don't hate me for having no RL.<P>Hunt well friends  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Poppa Cappo<BR>40th Level Druid<BR>GL of Colleage of Sanctuary<BR>email: poppa@hailcos.org</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Amen Qumil and Poppa !<P>As one of those people that play EQ far too much than is healthy,  I would like to know what you have against people leveling fast, if you don't want to twink then don't, and if your really that anti-twink then make it a personal policy not to group with twinks, but since most of us that are "leveling so fast" are not going to be twinking anytime soon, I cannot really see how its a valid complaint of any kind.  As a finaly note, anyone that comes onto a public message board and complains about people leveling up in EQ having no lives, perhaps you should take a look in the mirror and consider people that post to message boards about other people having no lives.

</FONT><HR>Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. In EQ levels equals power. So by this reasoning I don't want high levels on a server with me because they are corrupt.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>In all seriousness, I feel, most of the evils of EQ can be traced back to higher level players abusing lower level weaker players. <P>A Level 5 can't consistantly KS another level 5. A level 10 can't monoplize a zone to power level some one. A level 15 can't farm a good camp solo that could sere a level 15 group just to sell or ebay the rare drop. A level 20 can't make an insane twink that runs around acting like a spoiled brat, ksing etc. <P>I don't beilieve that all highlevel players are like this but as soon as their are a few 30+ players that have the power to do the things described above at least some will. These things hurt lower level players. I want the opportunity to get as much out of this game as I can and a new server is the only chance to do that without some highlevel jerk exploiting his power to take part of the game away from me to satisfy his/her greed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>hehe....  this is funny.<P>I didn't start a character on this server, cause there were so many when it got open... not crazy about lag.  But I wish I did.  I only put an average of 15 hours a week...   dont' take me wrong warmaker, but I'd be over lvl 10 by now.  I got my Necro to lvl 11 in less than a month... about 60-70 hours...  And if it wasn't for me working on Trade skills... I'd probably be at least 2 lvl's higher.<P>If I had an average of 30-40 hours a week... I'd probably be in the 20's... and some people here play even more than that...  Can't help it if people are Hooked to the point they don't want to do anything else... hehe  It's their right.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I dont see the problem.... If people wanna level fast let them, as long as its done honestly. <P>I do undertstand your complaints when you see druids (played 24/7 by different people) PL'ing people and basicly claiming a vast amount of mobs so that a guild can get the classes they need. But keep in mind that anyone can play this game the way they feel... if someone sees tons of fun in getting PL'ed and getting to 60th as fast as possible, well let them. <P>Enjoy the game the way you want to</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

TWINKS MUST DIE! ( sorry getting out aggression ) i've grouped with twink, he was one lvl higher then me. next week he's lvl 27 ! how can he get 10 lvls in a week ! power lvl'd by his lvl 50 + friend ? maybe the same person that twinked him, who knows. all i know is a lvl -10 can NEVER get bronze or a FBR. jsut doesn't happen. ok, see ya people. gonna work on brewing a bit maybe. nothing else to work on<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR> Hahaha after re-reading this I just have to pick this apart...warmaker states:<P> "i think it's cause they are offended by what i said, i think it's cause they know they have no lives playing so much, i play this game almost all of my free time and all i got is a 20 shaman ( could've had at least 22 but that is a different story :P ) oh well, whatever, i'm having fun, i don't care about these lvl 50 + people with no lives"<P> He says people have no lives playing so much and in the same sentence he says "i play this game almost all of my free time". <P> In that same sentence he says "i play this game almost all of my free time and all i got is a 20 shaman ( could've had at least 22 but that is a different story :P )" - All you got was a L20 shaman huh? Well maybe this game isn't for you then. Sounds like a bit of jealousy to me. I mean what you are essentially saying is that people devote all their free time to this game and attain L30+ and yet when you do it all you manage to get is L20. Basically what that boils down to is that you're upset that people are better/more experienced than you are.<P> And then the clincher: "oh well, whatever, i'm having fun, i don't care about these lvl 50 + people with no lives" - Well warmaker, obviously you do. Otherwise we wouldn't even see your name on these message boards, at least not in relation to this subject. I'll bet when you finally get your drivers license (which I'm assuming you aren't old enough for yet) that you will be saying: "Dood, Patrick has such a nice car cause his parents bought it for him cause he's spoiled and he's an idiot and I hate him, but I don't care cause my car is just fine and even though it's rusty it is just transportation and I have fun driving it and...well I dont care about Patrick....even though he sux I am happy and not jealous and geez...I really dont care what Patrick has...and...".<P> Seriously warmaker, your posts are nothing but self-contradictions and bad comparisons. It hurts my senses just to view your posts, as they are poorly thought, unimaginitive, and utterly unconvincing arguements with horrendous punctuation and sentence structure.<P> Please, just go away =)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>   Ok, this is about leveling and twinking. First a little on players that level fast.<BR>   EQ is a reflection of the human condition you can not escape it you just have to deal with it. People work hard on what is important to them, (most high level characters are very motivated players wishing to excel at advancment to meet new challanges and overcome new obstacles) some people are content with collecting welfare for a living and others are not happy unless they are controling a large market share with a huge corporation. <BR>   Now a little on twinks. Twinking is just a natural occurance. Consider that most parants provide their children with the best oppertunity to succeed in the form of material and non-material gifts. Such as food, clothing, cars, education, advice ect. While some will argue that it is the responsiability of parents to provide all of these things, others would not. My parents never bought me a car! I guess I was not a twinked as much as some of my friends were...<BR>   I would elaborate but I think it best that some of you put your own thought into what I am saying here. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Yeah, it sucks that you don't have as much time to play as you'd like. Cry me a river. The rest of us pay to play too...why shouldn't we get to enjoy it?<P>And your "no life" argument is pretty stupid. I'd venture to guess that a lot of people who don't play video games at all would give you the same advice...to get a life. <P>Those who live in glass houses...<P>btw - I do think that twinking needs to be curbed a lot in this game.
