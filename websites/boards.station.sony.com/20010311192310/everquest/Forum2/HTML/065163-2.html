</FONT><HR>Ok guys, just got done reading the posts that were after mine. Perhaps most of you should reread what Sunndew said. She was just saying that its rediculous how some epics are so amazingly more difficult than the others. She used the druid epic as an example because she IS a druid and therefor knows the most about that quest... plus, she is having difficulty with part of it. Not once did she say that the druid epic was the hardest, she never even said that epics weren't supposed to be difficult. Ok, granted druids generally have life easy in Norrath.. what with their teleporting abilities and whatnot. So what? They aren't the most powerful class in the game. Well, in my opinion, there is no most powerful class. I see it as all opinion, and it's how you play the game.. but I digress. I agree with Sunndew, the epic quests should be balanced. The fact that she is a druid shouldn't make a difference at all to how anyone reacts to what her point was.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The problem with the quests is that they are not balanced internally either.<P>I would have less of a problem with the Necromancer or Druid quests being insanely hard if they were also insanely *useful.*  They aren't.  Not even close.  The Cleric Epic is insanely useful.  The Enchanter Epic is extremely useful.  The Shaman Epic?  Sure, it not even in the same ballpark as the Magician Epic, but it also kinda sucks.<P>Guilds walk through the Cleric quests because it is an enormous benefit to all concerned to have an Epic-wielding Cleric in guild.  My guild would gain nothing for helping me complete my Epic Shaman weapon.  It is a status symbol, little more.<P>So to some respect, the quests should also be balanced based on the utility and desirability of the end result.<P>Under that notion, the Necromancer Epic weapon should require turning in two bat wings and a fire beetle eye I guess...   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Aadania unfortunately what Sundeww said is very important to the argument. Some classes have easy epics because everything else they do is very hard. What if they said tomorrow "We agree sundeww, we should make your quest as easy as the others. BUT we will have to make your everyday life as HARD as the other classes that you think have an easier epic" I guarantee that you will have the very first post complaining about it. As far as saying druids are not the most powerful class I am buckling over in laughter. Because last time I checked NO other classes can fight 4 mobs simutaneously. Hmm interesting you think other classes are more powerful. Can you please name the ones that are?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I said it is all OPINION and the way you play the game. EVERY class is good at one thing or another, it's how you use your class's skills that count. Druids are great soloers, while other classes are great groupers. I still don't see why half of the posts following Sunndew's was about how druids are so powerful, they don't need an easier epic, which wasn't what her post was about anyway. That was all I was saying.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Okay Pytheous.  I never said I wanted my epic handed to me.  I DONT!  I want it Balanced along with all the OTHERS.  You have not read a word I said once you realized I play a druid.  Sure druids have it easy.  We can port instead of run, we can quad kite with ease, but you know what?  We cant get it group most of the time so this is what we are FORCED to do. Even with the lack of groups I have never asked for any of the changes that have been given to druids.  I have never whined about the class I play.  I like playing a druid and thought they were fine they way they were, so dont blame me for whining about that aspect.<BR>And as for knowing what it is like to have to run zones without sow and beg for binds, I also play a Rogue that is on the same account.  So I do know what it is like.  <BR>Go back and check how many times I have posted on this Board.  I have maybe posted a dozen times since I have been playing EQ and only started maybe 3 threads.  Check your facts before you accuse somebody of something.<BR>Please get back to the topic at hand and not the fact that I play a druid. <BR>(OH! and FYI! the reason that I started playing and made a druid was so that I could help my RL husband who plays a shaman, not for the ease of the class)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've been sitting for days in Skar hunting Quillmane for the silly pegasus cloak for my mage epic.<P>Fun things to know about this cloak:<P>1. It drops off a level 30 mob that is a rare spawn.<BR>2.  It is the mob's RARE drop, not the common.<BR>3.  It is No Drop (Verant's early response to Magician complaints was Trade or buy it..didn't even realize that it was no drop)<BR>4.  It has a semi-useful effect (unlimited Lev) that makes is semi-desirable for other classes (it is ALL ALL)<BR>5.  The S Kar zone is low to mid levels.  Well below the exp point for a 50th (epic) magician.<P>Suggestions for improving the Quillmane issue for the magician epic:<P>1.  Up his spawn frequency (downside..more cloaks running about the game used for non-epic)<BR>2.  Increase his level to 45-50 to keep the cloak pretty much only for the cloak hunters for the epic.  Maybe couple this with suggestion 1.  Quilly is non-aggro so he won't be just running rampant killing players.<BR>3.  Replace the Pegasus Cloak with a different item that isn't a lucky no-drop uber rare spawn<BR>4.  Have the cloak also spawn on a different mob in a higher level zone.<P>Other issues with the magi epic would be the extreme rarity of the staffs from Inny and Phinny.  Unreal.<P>Put the items on a mob that is very tough to beat requiring an epic achievement to acquire.  For a mage to have to defeat Phinny, Inny, Capt Rottgrime, Neh'Ashirr, and Mobs from the 7th aisle in Sky IS pretty epic.  Now having parts from those mobs as Uber Rare drops is overkill.  <P>To take down these mobs requires a lot of help and coordination..one or two..probably not too epic..but look in total..to have put together a kill on all of these..at least give a 50% chance that the mob will drop the item required.  Heck, make the items have no other value other than for epics if there is worry of a flood of items into the game.<P>I want an item to be proud of based upon how I acquired it.  Camping a level 30 horse for hours/days on end to get a lucky spawn...that doesn't speak to me in epic terms.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Druids are redused to about 1 epic a week....thats not bad.  <BR>The other classes can get their items to easily IMHO (and my kids rogue will be 50 within a month or 2 and I still think that it should be nerfed right away for fairness)<BR>Try being a Necro or Wizard.  I hear Cazic's Blood drops about 1 in 30 and Skin drops 1 in 20.<BR>Mage's have to get a 1 in 10 or 15 drop also off Inny<BR>both have a spawn of 1 week IF (thats a big if) they are constantly that means that about 3 mages and wizards a year will get get their epics in a year and maybe one lucky necro will get their joke...I mean epic.<P>Leave druids where they are or even make it slightly harder/longer.

</FONT><HR>Since its my class, I'll add a bit to the wiz epic discussion.  It's really just three main fights, a staff off Phinny in KK, a staff off of Venril Sathir &lt; 7 day spawn and very rare drop, plus if you work he's dead for the week before you get home on patch day&gt;, and the skin of Cazic Thule (!) another 7 day spawn and rare drop.  Nothing to it, it's cake.  Add in that the wizard epic is just plain not that great... you'd expect it to be a mega DD spell, or a manaless DD of some sort, but instead its a self buff at no cost.  I don't know why I even bother to worry about it.  Mostly, it just sorta sticks in my craw the number of times I have helped others do a part of their epic, I know that I can't ask them to pitch in and help me.  "Say, guys, why don't we all call in sick next wednesday and the guild can raid VS for my epic..."  Riiiiight.

</FONT><HR>Man this board is brutal.<P>Incessant ranting of children saying "My quest is more difficult than yours.  You can't cry yet."<P>ALL the Epics are of Varying difficulty for varying Reward.  The sad thing is that the Reward isn't always the Best for the Hardest/Rarest items Quest.<P>I'd have to say teh Necro Epic has the single rarest drop (the Black Silk Cape) with the worst effect of all the epics.  Oppositely, the Rogue has the 'easiest' (well tough mobs but triggered spawns so the longest camp really is 6 hours, whereas the Necro one is a rare chance to get hte cloak every week) and yet is one of the best rewards.  The Mage Epic is probably the most balanced for difficulty/Rarity Vs. Reward.  Yes, it is an incrediably hard quest with very rare drops, however Uber Gonaner is a bad@ss.  This is why things are out of whack.  Time put in isn't equal to the reward.  In the case of both Rogue and Necro Epics it is just the opposite (one Neg, one pos).  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree that the quests are far out of balance. <P>Just in my guild, almost every single cleric has their epic, and some alt clerics are working on it.<P>Every Shaman has thier epic.<P>Every Rogue.<P>We also have 1 warrior complete, 1 who only needs to turn in the pieces, and another which will be completed this weekend. We have 1 SK epic, 1 chanter epic, 1 Bard, 1 Druid, 1 Ranger. No Mage epic. And here's the kicker. There isn't a single Necro epic on the server. Why? Simple, the black silk cape for the Cloak of Spiroc Feathers in Sky has *never* dropped on my server. Nobody has it.<P>Balanced? Not even remotely close. As for which is harder, I guess that depends on how you look at them, and the guild you are in. Killing dragons is far easier for us than getting super rare/nonexistent quest pieces.<P>Ledrone Soultaker<BR>59 Defiler<BR>Quell </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Pytheous, if we ever have a competition to find the most bull headed idiot on the whineplay board, remind me to bet on you.<P>You have constantly refused to acknowledge what the original poster ACTUALLY SAID and go into some stupid "overpowered druid" frenzy.<P>Forget druids, I'll rephrase the question for you.<P>Why is the rogue epic so incredibly easy to get compared to the necro epic given that the rogue epic is an awesone weapon and the necro epic , if not useless, at least lives next door to useless and knows him very well.<P>Replace rogue/necro as you see fit. It's not about class it's a question about balance.<P>btw FYI, I'm a warrior, not a druid.
