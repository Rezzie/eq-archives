I will have little access to the Internet while I'm there, and I don't want to start a thread like this right before I leave. Also, for you Rogues reading, I'm moving you back to Tuesday next week, I won't be in the office on Monday.<BR>Monks are one of those interesting types of warrior that, as a class, we have tried to balance a rather large volume of damage dealing with a lesser type of armor. It's not an easy task to build a fighting class that is 'balanced' with a warrior but doesn't wear armor…<P>So tell me what you think needs to be changed about monks. Keep in mind that I am primarily looking for balance issues, but give me whatever you've got. I am also not looking for suggestions that would dramatically change the class, or that would require an army of people to get into the game. I'm mostly looking for tweaks that would help to balance the class.<P>Thanks.<P>Alan<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Time to put a ripple in the pond...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>What I would wish for in a monk:<P>I wish verant would take a look at the intrensic ac/regen/ultravision/better base stats coding from an iksar, and consider dumping a few of those attributes on a human.<P>Before I get bombed off the board, let me try to rationalize.  A good deal of human monks were created LONG before the Iksar existed.  There was no choice in the matter (nullifies the gnome warrior vs troll warrior argument, in that I was never given a choice).  I cannot change my mind.  I am 60, i have close to 200 days played, i have many many no drop items, and to scrap my human for an iksar would be an insult to my guild for rewarding me with these items.  Simply leveling an iksar monk would be no big deal, but replacing the no drop items would be extremely difficult, as well as self indulgent.  With that said, here's the wish(es):  <P>I.  Ultravision<BR>First and foremost, as a human I would die for ultravision (naked ultravision, as i can get this through items / spells).  Countless times on a total party wipeout, monks and necromancers basically 'race' to see who gets CR done first - i win, we save the guild coffin money/time, necro wins, generally when i die trying :/.  Total party wipeout implies that im dead...and naked...and blind.  How imbalancing would it be to make ultravision a class based attribute regarding monks?  Ie: not all humans get ultra, but the monk class, with thier Zen ways, have achieved a skill, human or lizard, to see in the dark.  <P>II.  That ac thing<BR>When im naked, my ac is near 800 (i think more like 780), while my iksar brother is closer to 900 (more like 860).  I understand the scales and so forth.  But when an iksar and human get all geared up in top line equipment, the iksar will always win, by about 30ac.  Would it be too much to ask, to up  the base ac of a human to that of an iksar?  Can't be but 5-10%% difference.  Cant be imbalancing, as its present in game.<P>III.  Regen<BR>Not a huge factor in the high level game.  I'm content regenning less than my iksar counterparts.<P>IV.  Stats<BR>Again, no biggie, im content being a little less 'stat-isfied'.  I can accept it.<P>V. Non iksar jealousy topics<BR>1) FD - please consider letting FD wipe hate on huge mobs.  It has nothing to do with splitting big mobs, it has to to with monk damage being handed over in small amounts with extreme rapid delivery.  We are all over the hate list, and for some reason, FD wont take us off any more.  Generally leads to me getting smooshed.  Typical notion is to just let me die and get ressed, as is would cost far less mana, than to try to keep me alive.<BR>2) Disciplines/damage output<BR>I dont bother with many disc.  Just stonestance,innerflame, and the occational riposte.  Would be great to see stonestance duration extended a bit, and the refresh of innerf/whirl dropped a bit.  Thunderkick is glamordamage.  It doesnt interest me either way.<BR>Im fairly content with damage output.  I have to say flying kick for 3 is silly...something to consider.<BR>3)Defensive Qualities<BR>Would be nice to gain just a bit more ac (see above) and perhaps raise our defensive qualities a bit.<BR>4) Inherent Resists<BR>Naked, lvl 60 hum monk has 44 RF (iksar is deferent i think). (seems like i was born with 33 RF - so an 11 RF bonus through 60 levels).  Would be extremely kind of you to move this 11 RF to RM.  <BR>5) Mend<BR>after skill 100 mend is static.  Would be neat to make mend a bit different after 201.  For instance:<BR>a) shrink the 6 minute cycle a bit (5-10%)<BR>b) make it heal for a touch more (5-10%)<BR>c) allow for us to target others and mend them (loh analogy)<BR>6) Sneak<BR>I see almost no use for sneak.  Can help in scouting / pulling, but very limited.  At the very least, id like to be able to run full speed with sneak, and maybe sneak in the water.  I also wish it would work on at least 90% blue mobs, and not just mobs 7+ levels lower than me. Would love to have sneak function as invis, but dont want to trample into the rogues dept. :P<BR>7) ID<BR>If instill doubt is maxed.  It should 'land every time', with a resist check for the fear component.  As it stands, i can make 4-5 ID attempts (thus omitting 4-5 flying kicks, thus gambeling a kill by not handing the mob more damage) and have it work only once or twice.  I'd be happier with a 'resist' than a 'nothing'.<P>I'd like to add, that im very happy with the monk class in gerneal: the monk role is great.  The playability and 'fun-factor' is way up at the top.  I'd just like a few minor enhancements that would bring us all in line with the evolution that has taken place with RoK / SoV.<BR>That's all for now.

</FONT><HR>I agree with what most are saying in the other threads, especially about mininum damage and such.  I don't think a high-end special attack deserves such low-end damage with a huge time delay.  But I am sure that will be worked out.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>My ideas:<P>Probably been said already, but maybe not, and since I am using valuable work-time (hehe) I can't read all 250+ posts.<P>The vision statement for the monk class does indeed say toe-to-toe we should be the best melee damagers in the game.  What do we lose for this glorious status?  Well, hit points, AC, and we get the notorious weight limit.  Do rogues or warriors get this?  No.  So we should be pumped up a bit to resume our high-end damage reputation.  After all, we sacrifice more than rogues or warriors do to be allowed that ability, we should at least have the ability in return.  From what I remember, pre-RoK was like that.  Monks were, without question, the highest dmg dealers in the game.  Were they the best melee class, unbalancing all?  No.  They did not have the warrior HP or AC, or the rogues evade.  <P>Thus, while pre-RoK we could deal the best damage, we were balanced by our restrictions.  Now we are not the best damage dealers, but still have these restrictions.<P>Solution:  Either loosen up on restrictions, or enhance abilities.  Either way I would be happy.  If I can't deal the most damage, then give me some more HP and AC options in return.  Or if I get boosted up to deal more damage, then the current restrictions will once again make sense.<P>Speaking of sense I hope I made some, and maybe Absor will agree.<P>Raloth - Wandering Monk of Norrath</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm not sure this is a (unintended) bug, nor that it's specifically about monks.<P>If a monk feigns death, then a cleric atones that mob (or memory blur), the mob can still remember the monk when he stands again.  Seems like a successful atone should erase its memory of the monk as well as everything else.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Monk feign should fail when you get hit by a nuke... that is the way it works currently. However if you fully resist the nuke it should not  make feign fail. <P>If you resist a spell your body does not twitch in agony as lightening arcs through you. Mobs cannot tell if you are really dead or if you just resisted the spell. Full resists on force shock don't push you back so how to the mobs know it works? Why not make it so that feign only fails when a spell lands on you? It rewards monks for high resists and yet lets mobs break feign with spells. It would not be overpowering but every once in a blue moon it would actually help make the monk's life a easier in surviving those dungeons with a ton of caster mobs.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I havent been playing a monk for too long, but I have started one and leveled him a bit...<P>I have always viewed a monk as one who is one with their envrionment, for lack of a better choice of words, 'one with the force' par say.<P>Seeing this, I am curious to know why we are so equipment based, instead of skill.<P>Another concern I have is the fact when you wear boxing gloves, and hit someone with a fist, it doesnt hurt nearly as much as when you are wearing some type of plated gloves. Or even no gloves at all, I dont understand why gloves dont have a damage component built in. (Only for H2H, it wouldnt make sense wielding a stick too).<P>P.S. I also understand that the skill based class idea was mentioned earlier, and the only reason I have repeated it, is how strongly I feel about this class.<P>I have stopped playing my monk because the class doesnt really feel like a 'monk'...<P>-=-=-=-=-<P>-Serek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A couple of feign death comments:<P>First, to the person who suggested you should be able to hit feign a second time to stand back up instead of having to hit the sit button, PLEASE don't do this!!!!!  The way feign works right now, you can hit feign repeatedly without ever standing up to clear more agro (with the risk of course that you will botch a feign and everything will come running at you).  Changing this will make it impossible for monks to clear agro on multiple mobs ever.<P>Second, something really should be done to eliminate the need for monks to /q when feigned.  We already have the ability to totally wipe agro by /qing, it takes about 5 minutes to do but most high level monks do this often.  Why not give them the ability to do it legitimately while staying inside the game?  Here's what I would suggest.  Create a new skill (or discipline even if it had a very short reuse time) that would cause the monk to feign and be effectively mezmerized for 3 minutes.  During this time the monk can't get up, move or do anything, but if he's attacked the mez is broken and he can fight back or refeign.  At the END of the 3 minutes, the monk is totally agro wiped and the monk can get up and proceed.  This will only give the monk the ability to do what we already do anyways, but be able to stay in the game, not need to reform groups, etc.<P>And, of course, I agree with most of the other posters that a moderate increase in damage is needed for monks.  If the typically equipped post 50 monk is really doing around the same damage as the typically equipped post 50 warrior (as most of us feel is the case), then we are relatively equal at offence but severely deficient in defense compared to warriors, and the balance needs to be adjusted.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well i have posted on a few things before but there's an idea:  Meditate this can either:<BR>1)cure poison/disease/etc faster<BR>2)Raise our attack for a short time<P>other ideas:<BR>1)Also I think crecent armor needs to be looked into.  It should have at least 1 more ac than cured silk.<P>2)Flying kick minimum: 3dmg for flying kick is pretty lame.<P>3)Give the other special attacks some purpose.  Like dragon punch or tail rake have a stun effect.  <P>4)Increase our dmg output by a bit (not by crit hits on throwing).  Monks need some purpose in groups and when warriors do more damage than us and can tank better what's our purpose in a group?  Now by no means lower the warrior damage output but maybe give us a little more.<P>5)This isn't my idea but here's a new monk skill called grapple, not sure how useful it would be though. What about a skill called grapple. Essentially it reduces the AC of the target by a ton, say from 1000 to 500 or something. The downside is that while the monk is using it, they cannot attack, and if the mob breaks the grapple the monk is stunned for a number of rounds. So it would be sort of dangerous, but it could be used to help the group tear down another mob.<P>6) Many great ideas at: http://pub28.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=4001.topic<BR>this has the best compolation of ideas<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>= Attack =-<BR>this section is about what enhancement could be made to monk attack , damage out put etc.<BR>* Triple attack : should boost up our damage and why would a warrior wish isnt a master of melee but of handling blow get triple attack and monk dont get it ?<BR>* minimum flying kick / thunder kick damage : we often see a 3 damage flying kikc or 24 damage thunderous kick raise the cap like rogue minimum damage back stab so at least we dont see those 3 damage kick no more<P>* off hand damage bonus : being monk we dual wield form our 1st lvl fromt eh game ... we could get a bonus to our off hand damage with fist and 1hb even if the damage is only half of the primary hand would be nice to have some kind of bonus<P>* unbinding strike and kick : if you ever went to a karate or any martial art contest youll see that oponent dont wait 8 second to kick then give a strike , being expert martial artist , monk should be able to strike and kick at nearly the same time .<P>* making monk fist more apropriate at higher lvl , fist always saty kinda slow maybe reduce their delay a lil bit or enhance the damage would help monk use their fist , or make special fist delay for off hand and primary hand .<P>* thunder kick isnt a so nice discipline , making it a innate skill like flyingkikc or dragon claw/tail rake would make monk comunity happy if not simply make it a timed discipline : 2 minute when every flying kick become thunderous kick<P>* fix Celestial fist and robe of the wristling fist stacking issue , also making celestial fist 10/16 instead of 9/16 would be better because rogue é warrior get weapon with delay as good as monk celestial fist and their weapon isnt from quest (fiery weapon) .<P>make one of our innate special attack able to interupt caster often a monk wont be able to kill cleric like creature because they cant interupt him/her from casting their healing spells<P>-= Defense issue =-<P>* as we know monk are well known to be master at doging blocking and riposting using their body , because fot he lack of high end armor having those maxing at 252 would give monk more chance surviving normal mob , wouldnt help all that much vs uber mob .<P>* our curent armor from plane , kurnak , Velious all have low armor class , very low armor class would be nice to make those worth wearing most of monk will wear azure sleeves for ever , because there is no upgrade to them right now , Armor class is KING for now stats really dont help .<P>* a revamp of head bands/sash would be nice , iksar get nice shackle and human dont get really interesting shash / head bands , making them no drop would also be a nice idea making iksar work their faction for the robe of the lost circle<P>* collar of the nekisha is pretty heavy lowerring weight and handing 1 ac would make it more valuable to human monk<P>* treant fist take 35-40 hour to quest for , there is new gloves called gem inlaid gauntlet that take 1 hour and are better , Treant Fist REALLY need an upgrade of some kind a spell of druid fomr lvl 1 4 or 9 would make it more worth questing .<P>* if monk over agro a creature he have no way to make him self lowered from hate list , ranger have spells , rogue have evade , monk are damage dealer so verant might think of an idea to let them lower them self from agro list<P>* Human should be able to wear iksar Shackle since iksar can wear headbands , Sash .<P>* mend : mend is usefull form lvl 1 to 50 after that it dont heal enough to save a monks life in pulling situation mobs hit to hard , thus giving mend a slight upgrade wouldnt be bad . Suggested idea : from level 1 to 50 mend heal 25% or about from lvl 51 to 54 heal 35% from lvl 55 to 59 heal 45% and at lvl 60 would heal of 50-60% <P>* a small hp bonus every lvl like paladin Sk got over ranger would help monk survival Versus BIG monster encounter.<P>-= abilities =-<P>* spreading weight bonus form vll 51 to 60 instead of 55 and 60 would help the monk comunity , lost of monk might not get to 55 so might never reach the bonus i am sure they would love the small +1 bonus at every lvl and it give us a reason to want to lvl more getting small upgrade every level is better then a big one 5 level later .<P>* Feign death to be revamp i dont want to go in detail but other have suggested lots of good idea about how to make Feign death better then it actualy is .<P>thats pretty much all , this would put monk in the middle of a warrior and a rogue . not as much damage then a rogue but better at handling blow , not as much good at taking blow as a warrior but making them deliver more damage . I think this would put Monk just like they were before Kurnak **Balanced** .<P>Drazzel Lezzard <BR>iksar monk of the 44th season<BR>member of the Lost circle<BR>the pacificator = )<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just a idea, but would'nt it be cool if maybe a sucessful instil doubt would fear + maybe like a snare effect. Nothing more enoying then having to chase a mob that can run faster than you. Or maybe im thinking about using it in the wrong way? Like a 10% snare effect would be nice (if it could be done).

</FONT><HR>First off, I completely agree with Zad/Bodi's list they generated on the very first page of the initial monk-talk thread.<P>The thing I see missing from the responce from Absor is the armor issue.  The armors available to the monk class are completely out of line.  Some pieces are better AC then the planar armor, yet designed for the lower lvl player.  Please go back to the Zad/Bodi post and read the armor issue carefully.  Mostly, all monks at high levels are wearing the same identical armor (given thier race allows) until the wt limit is raised.  Then some sacrafice more wt for high ac armor, of which is rarely ever monk only.  In fact, most if not all monks are barely wearing and monk only armor.<P>I am level 51 with over 150 hours of play.  I am a casual gamer.  I have the best 1h blunt combo, at least prior to SoV or Epic, and am halfway done with my Epic.  At present, when I look at other monks around my level, I see the same armor I am wearing.  Usually, the only difference is the occasional dragon/god pieces that some have.  The only monk-only armor I am wearing is the Robe of the Lost Circle (quested version) and Crescent Slippers (haven't had Shiverback Slippers drop for me yet, the only viable planes armor piece.)<P>I have a full suit of Crescent armor, Treant Fist Guantlets, and some pieces of Shiverback armor all sitting in the bank. I'll never touch any of it.<P>And the velious armor.. some of it is nice, some of it I'll just keep with me to use the effects and then put back in the bag, and some I'd wear.  But why are all the different Velious armors almost the same?  Why should I kill things in Temple of Veeshan for quest armor from Keal Drakken that will be just as easy to get from the Plane of Growth at a much lower level?  The risk vrs reward on the Velious armor is sad.  The rewards for the different quests are all near the same with rare differences.<P>I just feel that monk armor should of gotten effects a while ago.  Crescent armor with some effects would be nice, even if minor effects.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Generally I'm happy playing my monk, but there are a few things I can suggest. I'll split it up into what I like, and what I don't like.<P>First off, How about a few new skills? I would suggest the following:<P>COMBO MOVES! I think this would be an excellent way to use skills that you already have, but acts more like a discipline. It could use the monk skills that are already available, like Tail Take and Flying kick simultaneously. Since we can't use these skills simultaneously anyway, it would be a great idea to increase the damage output of monks without necessarily giving them whole new abilities. The higher the level that the Combo skill would get, the greater amount of damage/actual hits/# of skills used. With a good delay on the combo skill, say once every 45 seconds to a minute, it would be an excellent solution to giving monks more damage output.<P>Also,<P>How about giving monks a skill that can decrease their weight for a period of time. There could be a negative effect in there too if it fails, much like mend. <P>Lastly,<P>Speed skill? I don't know how plausable this idea is to verant, but I think it would be an excellent discipline type skill. Using the speed skill to increase ATK speed for a period of 30 seconds with a long re-use delay would be very helpful. Even if it is only 10 - 15%. As the skill got better in it, the more speed % it would do, or the longer it would last.<P>What could be CHANGED:<P>Instill Doubt: This skill should me more effective. My monk currently has I think a 170 Skill in ID, and it's just not that effective.<P>FD agro post 35. While more realistic, it is very difficult to use. Up until 35 monks can pull and FD and almost immedeatly get back up without anything reaggroing. After 35 this all changes however, and mobs will reagro almost indefinitely if a monk stands after FDing. I think this should either be changed to a higher level (45+), or the percentages of reagro should be reduced. Simply put, it's too difficult to continuously /q when FD'd. And it's really not that fair that we have that ability.<P>What I'm happy about:<P>Iksar Regen: Rocks, thank you.<BR>Flying Kick: While I'd like to land more, it's still a very useful skill with a good delay.<BR>Mend: Saves my butt all the time, I can't complain.<P>Feels good to get that off my chest  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Thanks,<P>-Makeit Soo<BR>40 Monk <BR>Lanys T'vyl</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor<P>I realize you cannot be expected to fully know all aspects and details of every class. I was however disappointed when I read your response, where you questioned if monks were to outdamage warriors.<P>High damage output is the trademark of monks, monks have been stated the masters of toe-to-toe melee countless times by verant, and works (this is now repeated n number of times, I know) well until you hit the 50s. They our relative power diminish, and we our situation are getting close to where the rangers was prior to their upgrade in defense and spells.

</FONT><HR>Here are my thoughts:<P>= Quests for weightless bags. We can't carry enough loot and coin to afford 'store-bought' bags, so we should be able to quest for them. Same for coins. A 10%wt reduction coin bag is just ridiculous. Even if it weighs 0.1, you have to carry 40 coins just to break even with the weight of the bag! As we all know, that is 1wt right there, leaving little room for monks to carry more coins (in general)<P>= Spread the increased weight limit over the levels after 50 as Zadkiel stated. This makes sense in every way.. as you gain more exp, you should learn how to tolerate weight more effectively, not in big chunks.<P>= FD fix. Like was said before, SK's can pull much more effectively than monks due to snare/FD. Warriors are more effective due to better HPs. FD isn't used for pulling, fine. But now it fails so frequently on SoV mobs (when being used properly)that it is almost useless.<P>= Minimum Dmg on Thunder Kick and Flying Kick! (did we mention that before? hehe)<P>= We aren't supposed to be reliant upon weapons. Bring our fists up to par with weapons that are dropped<P>= Let us select which coins we want to loot/hold! Auto destroy silver and copper (sometimes gold) would be useful.<P>= Why would Iksar want to gain faction with Qeynos and Freeport, do all their quests, and then deal with even more human (soft-skin) masters to get a RotLC? In a RP sense, Iksar should have to 'steal' a robe if they want it. Do not take the Robe drop off Zephyl, he is one of the reasons I am an evil monk! Humans questing for it can get it at 35 or so, anyone who kills Zephyl has to be post 50 and have a lot of friends helping. That right there is a price to pay.<P>As for humans 'iksar jealousy', ask them if they think 30ac(over even 75ac) and a slight regen at level 50 or later will help Iksar kill 20% more mobs than a human (solo). Nope. 20% xp penalty is totally balanced.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Alrighty, lets face it, at this point anything that is written will just be cast aside seeing as its at the bottom of a master thread. Will most of the changes we proposed happen? Probably not... But we can dream. What I fear is that a couple of the less pressing matters will out-weight the true issues with our class... <P>The main issue as I see it is the Damage Output and the ability to lower ourselves on a mobs aggro list. These changes would have to come hand in hand as it were. Give us only higher damage, and you may as well give monks a 10 minute burst of sow right after death, because we'll be running back to our corpses after every pull (that was not a real suggestion, just a bit o' sarcasm). <P>We've had a lot of great ideas for damage output though, so I wont go into my own personal views on what should be done (triple attack? No. Flying Kick minimum? Definately)<P>So, the problem becomes avoiding damage (or lowering ourselves on a mobs aggro list). Monks truly can be the masters of taunt (and we dont even have to waste a hot key on it!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> At low levels this is just fine (I like taking my medicine from time to time) but once a mob goes over 100 per hit, a monk really has a bigger mental game on his hand than just slamming keys... Do I have a problem with a mental game? No, but I think that we should at least have a better way of avoiding an attack than feign (which practically everything will ignore *from my experience*) or shouting "Root It! For the love of GOD! Ow!" and running around in circles like half of the casters I've partied with when the mob turns on them (not talking about casters in general, just certain ones *you know who you are*  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>The idea that I liked most to lower on the aggro was the Tumble concept. Now, I heard it discribed for rogues by a buddy of mine in the past, but I think it would be quite fitting. What does it do? It throws you back about 5 feet from the mob and works similar to evade. It could be a seperate skill from special attacks (since it really wouldn't be unbalancing) and could only be activated when auto-attack was off. Now, the adding of new skills into the game is always a tough thing, if not impossible, but if I recall correctly Absor, you said that you liked the idea of a trainer for a skill at the end of a quest. But thats just one slight idea, and heck, I'm sure that most of us would just be happy with evade in general... <P>The only other thing I had considered would be a form of meditation for the monk (the words almost go together too well). Now, originally I thought it would be great to sit down and get tunnel vision (which would lesson based on skill) and regen hps faster, but the problem is that I play a human. You truly could not give an Iksar an extra added regen when sitting, and I could understand that. But perhaps the idea of a med for monks could be used for something... And thats just an idea to throw around...<P>Lastly, since I touched on the Human vs. Iksar subject I will say this: Do I think they are balanced? No, not at all. But is this the post that I should be discussing that in? Also no.<P>Evenight Vorpalstryke<BR>Wolves of Truth</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>First of all, i like to say that I have never played a Monk at EQ ... so I wont comment on their allready existing skills or skillcaps, because I wouldn't know how much it would mean for the balance betweem the guilds.<P>But I got some ideas from muds where you also can play monk, and where their role is much like the role they play in EQ.<P>Well here we go.<P>Non combat skills :<P>Yes, why not add some of these, well actually, theres only one, but why do all monk skills have something to do with smacking up people ... well, almost their skills is meant that way  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I named the skill : 'Sustain'.<BR>Monks are described as a class that is spiritual in one with them selves and the world arround them. In that case, I would believe that they shouldn't have the power forget that they are hungry or thirsty and live on spiritual energy. The monk should of course eat and drink, but as he or she increases in this skill, there usage of food should lower. This would also help the Monk, as food weights ... and monks always have to be careful with their weight, so a monk who masters 'sustaining' his hunger, wouldn't have to carry as much food as the younger monk.<P>Well, enough about that, I guess you get the idea.<P>On to the combat skills.<P>I read many posts about people wanting root alike abilities and some stunning powers also.<P>I dont like the idea about a root alike ability, because then all guild should have it ... if a monk could smasg a foot so the opponent couldn't move, then a warrior should have the ability to cut the legs of them ... so lets forget about root.<P>Stunning an opponent is more Monk alike in my monk fashion. And they got 2 really good ways doing it.<P>I call the 2 skills for 'Sweep' and the other for 'Pinch'.<P>'Sweep' is simple, the monk makes almost the same move as in the round kick, except that he sweeps the floor with his leg. This could be a low level ability, and could stun the opponent for a short period of time. And afterall, its pretty easy to lift a leg to avoid it. But hey, in almost any computer game with monk alike moves, then they have a 'sweep' move, so you can get away from you opponet.<P>The other is 'Pinch'. This skill is based on the monks knowledge about the human body. So they noe exactly where to press or 'Pinch' to inflict great pain or even stun someone for a few seconds, or if they choose to stun more than damaging, then they can aim for some spots, where the damage isn't so high, but the opponent slumps into unconsiousness (spelling). Of course this wouldn't be the case in the game, but it could be turned into a skill, where the goal is to stun your opponent.<P>Well, as for both 'Sweep' and 'Pinch' - of cource the race of the target should be considered in some way ... pinching or sweeping a dragon might be a little hard  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>The last one is a AoE based.<P>I called it 'Fists of Fury', sounded nice, and it more or less covers the idea pretty good.<BR>The idea is, that when the monk uses this power he should hit everything in his hitting radius. This could be limited to the opponents that he is facing, but it could also be opponents behind him. The damage output is of course limeted, as the power is focused on hitting many targets, this can also be leathel ... as monks is not tanks, and getting to many bad guys on you, could turn out bad.<P>Guess this was my 25 cents.<P>If anyone got any comments on it, I would very much like a copy in mail form.<P>Send to keller@microsux.dk<P>Happy EQ'ing<P>Dorka lvl 43 Warrior - Brell Serilis<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here's my input, as someone who has played a monk up to post-50 levels, and has been playing said monk since the first week the game went live.<P>One of the biggest gripes of monks is that our damage output compared to warriors and rogues went down a LOT with the release of Kunark. With the addition of new, faster and more damaging weapons, plus the increase of the warrior and rogue skill caps, Monks lost the 'niche' they used to have as the best toe to toe damage dealers, and they fell FAR behind rogues in damage output. <P>There have been many suggestions put forth to remedy this, and it's tough to say what would work, what wouldn't be overbalancing, and what would benefit all monks, whether they use their fists or weapons. I think Triple attack starting at 51 (firing infrequently) and getting better as we went up in levels from there would help a bit.<P> Possibly an innate damage bonus, (affecting hand to hand, 1hb and 2hb) starting with a very small bonus at 51, and getting better with each succeeding level? <P> Like I said, there are lots of suggestions out there, unfortunately many of them only affect a certain percentage of monks, such as those who only use hand to hand, or those who use two 1hb weapons.   I think any increase in damage potential would need to affect all monks, which rules out increases to fist damage or delay, etc.<P><BR>A second gripe monks have, is that their planes/high level armors have either the same, or LESS AC than armor obtainable in the 20s or 30s level wise. They basically have the same AC as cured silk.  A bit of a boost, to give a bit better AC would be really neat, and would probably get monks to actually *wear* their planes/high level armors. <BR> My monk is still wearing Azure sleeves at lvl 53 (almost 54), and I don't see her changing them anytime soon. AC12 vs. AC5 or 6?  I don't think so. She wears shiverback boots, because I haven't found anything with better AC plus stats.. but that's the only piece she wears with any regularity.<BR>I won't go on with any more examples, because you all know what I'm talking about, it's been stated dozens if not hundreds of times before. I just wanted to make sure you know I think it stinks. :P<P> Also on the subject of armor, it SURE would be nice to get a set of armor for monks that looks DIFFERENT than newbie armor!  Hello guys! &lt;whistling loudly and waving my arms around!&gt; My monk looks exactly the same at 53 as she did at level ONE!!  The only thing that makes me look different at all is wearing my Robe of the Lost Circle, and I won't have that much longer, if I get the pipe I need for the Whistling Fists robe, only to turn it in for the start of my epic quest! Sheesh... <P><BR>Next item.<BR>Thunderous Kick is a joke. You guys know it, We know it, you know we know it, and we know you know we know it. It's pathetic. It doesn't do a thing to help our damage output. In fact, with the increased chance to miss instead of hit that it seems to have, it actually DECREASES our damage output.<BR> Giving it the same chance to hit as a regular flying kick (tie it in to FK skill level maybe) and making it a discipline that lasts a couple minutes instead of one lousy kick, plus giving it a bit higher minimum damage than (24), would make it at least a useful discipline. <P>As it is, I just use it to get laughs from people... and it works like a charm for that. The most common phrase I see after I use it is "Ooooooohhh (24)...that was SUCH a thunderous kick!"  .. or variants of that.<P><BR>I would also like to speak about Feign Death.  It's a really great idea, and it's great when it works.. but even with a maxed skill at level 53, I get the "Zandramas has fallen to the ground" message about one in four or five tries!!! <BR> This has only started happening with this frequency in the last few months, since Velious was released I think.  I used to be able to feign twenty or thirty times at least before hitting a "fallen to the ground" message.   I'm starting to feel like a damn newbie again!  <P>The fact that the creatures see through Feign a good percentage of the time even when it supposedly works is pretty annoying also.  I'm not talking about caster mobs here, I know how to time FD so that a creature has already finished casting it's spell before hitting FD.  I'm talking about a melee only creature that's beating the tar out of me, and I feign death to avoid dying.. and it just keeps on beating me to death, even though I didn't get a "fallen to the ground" message. It sometimes happens several times in a row, although usually if I get one failure I'm pretty much going to die for sure, because of how hard things hit now.<P> It seems to happen 90 percent of the time or more if a monk has less than one bubble of health left. It's what I call my "kill the player code" theory. It's almost a sure bet that a monk will die if they're down to less than a bubble of health and try to feign. Even with no "fallen to the ground" message, it's VERY rare that a creature will be fooled once a monk is down that far, with no other way of avoiding death.<P>  Talk about frustrating..  the one thing that's supposed to help someone avoid dying, and it almost never works if one is about to die.. Hmmm<P><BR>I like what some people have said in earlier posts in this thread, about changing the way the weight limit increase works after lvl 50.  Giving us an increase of 1 per level starting at 51 would be a godsend.<BR> I happen to be one of the lucky few monks on Saryrn with a Tranquil Staff, and my AC goes to hell in a handbasket because I can't ever get down below 19 weight when I use my staff. just one point per level post 50 would be very helpful, yet not  an overwhelming change. <P> I love using the staff, but I usually have to set it aside during any battles where things are hitting for more than 150 or so.. or I get pounded into the ground and either die, or become a mana sink for the cleric. That counts for just about anything we fight in Velious. Almost everything there hits for over 150 that gives experience to 50+ people.<BR> After I set it aside of course I'm less effective by a good margin, and I feel more like a liability, and that a warrior could be better utilized, doing more damage and being far more mana efficient to heal. <P><BR> I also like the idea of giving monks a higher jump ability as safe fall goes up towards it's max. (mine is maxxed and has been since level 39 I believe it was.) It would be really fun to be able to jump higher and farther than other people.. just something different  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> Not really all that useful, but definitely something that would add some entertainment value. That's important too  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>The last thing I wanted to say I support was the idea of giving monks a lower capped (than rogues) hide/sneak ability at high levels, it would give us a chance at helping with corpse recovery after total wipeouts in the planes, and other very difficult zones.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><BR> I wouldn't think we could be so good at it as to be able to run while doing it, like rogues can, but it would be nice to be able to hide/sneak slowly even.<P><BR> Well, there's my input.. I hope Absor gets a chance to read down this far.. :/<P> Zandramas Hammerfist<BR> Disciple of the 53rd level of advancement.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>My main character is a level 60 monk on the Xegony server. I'm very happy playing a monk, I think they're a very enjoyable and entertaining class. However I think there are several issues that need to be considered when attempting to balance them with other melee classes.<P>First of all, I think monks should be able to taunt. As a monk I have a lot of difficulty taunting a mob off a caster who has agro'd it, much more than any other tank class.  Would this be unbalancing? No, and here is why--ALL other melee classes have taunt, with the exception of rogues (who are designed with anti-taunt in mind, fighting an enemy from behind while it is attacking someone else).  I have good ac and hp's when properly buffed, and my defensive skills are very good as well. However groups I'm in usually have to rely on a "taunting tank" in order to feel secure that the casters wont get shredded the moment they agro a mob.  Warriors, paladins, shadowknights, rangers all have the ability to taunt and get a mob's attention; monks can only beat on a mob and hope their melee damage causes agro to change at some point. Yes, melee damage does have a taunt factor, but it works nowhere near as fast as the taunt skill and agro caused by spellcasting. If a monk is expected to do all his taunting through melee damage then they need to have their damage output scaled up to be closer to a rogue's. Also there are now weapons available to other melee classes that allow them to approach, if not surpass, a monk's melee damage output so I don't think giving monks the ability to taunt would unbalance them.  If monks were given the taunt skill they would be able to be balanced with other melee types as a group's tank and main damage-taker.<P>Another issue I have is with the near-total inability to interrupt casting mobs. As a monk I am at a severe disadvantage when fighting a mob who casts dangerous spells such as gate or complete heal. Monks need some type of stun attack to interrupt in these situations (yes we do get a discipline at level 59 that has a chance of stunning, but it only works every 10 minutes or so; basically this gives us bash with a 10 minute recycle, as opposed to other classes who have their stun/interrupt skills recycle every few seconds). My solution to this would be to give one of the monk's auxillary attacks (kick, round kick, eagle strike, tiger claw, dragon punch) a stun component. This way a monk would be able to choose between the greater damage of flying kick, or the ability to interrupt casting with the lower damage skills. If a warrior is able to kick with stunning potential, why would a monk not be able to do so with their much more powerful kicks and strikes?<P>Another issue I have is with monk enhancements at 55 and 60 compared with what other melees get. Warriors get stun kicks at 55 and triple attack at 60.  Rogues get double backstab at 55 (making their damage output soar far above anyone else, period) and randomly lethal backstabs in certain situations at 60.  Monks get....1 extra hitpoint per tick while feigned at 55, and another at 60.  This is completely and totally insignificant, as no monk spends enough time feigned to notice any real effect from this. If a monk needs hp while feigned he simply waits for mend to recycle. My solution to this?  Monks should be given the ability to double attack with auxillaries (flying kick, dragon punch etc) and should also get a higher minimum damage to flying kick (kicks for 3 are embarrassing when a rogue is backstabbing for hundreds); or they need to be given some type of stun with one of their special attacks, as mentioned above. Another possibility would be to make the monk special attacks independent of one another (allowing a monk to use both flying kick and dragon punch, for instance) instead the way it is now, where all specials are greyed until the one last used recycles.<P>Another issue has to do with shiverback armor from the plane of fear.  Quite frankly it stinks.  Monks are the ONLY class that does not look forward to getting their planar armor.  Other classes drool from newbiehood at the thought of an apothic robe or indicolite breastplate etc, however monks typically dont even wear their shiverback, much less treasure it as their best pieces of equipment.  I wore my robe of the lost circle (that I quested for at level 37) over a shiverback jerkin when I finally got it, simply because it is a superior piece of equipment. The same goes for nearly all of my inventory slots--I wear some random piece of all/all gear with good ac and/or stats simply because shiverback isnt competitive (I'm not talking about amazingly good or rare stuff here, I'm talking about stuff I've had for 30 levels like azure sleeves or gatorscale legs). I know this is a touchy issue because you dont want monks to have ac that outclasses warriors, but I think something should be done to at least make shiverback armor desirable (maybe give it some rightclick effects since monks got no rightclick kunark armor like other classes, or extra bonuses to resists perhaps?) to the monks who are just becoming planesworthy but not looking forward to improving their gear like other classes.<P>About the epic fists--I love them (although I do think the quest is too easy compared to the other epics, sorry guys but you know it's true, it's not even close). I think they're wonderful, they allow a monk to solo very easily, and have a very viable alternative to grouping. However when grouped the effect is hardly effective at all.  Every haste buff overwrites it, so whenever I get aanya's quickening or speed of the shissar I have to sacrfice the 54 atk and 12ac granted by the fists effect in favor of greater haste.  What should happen is the fists should be made to work like the robe of whistling fists did, namely that it should still grant the atk/ac bonuses while allowing the monk to get haste from a faster enchanter buff.<P>Another issue is with the level 60 discipline, Ashenhand. As many may not be familiar with it, what it does is make the next eagle strike landed do surprising damage (usually around 300, sometimes more/less), and in certain situations has a chance to outright kill a mob (this has NEVER happened to me or anyone else I know who has used this discipline btw). This discipline is much less effective than others; I can sometimes do around 2k damage in 10 seconds with innerflame, and it recycles more than twice as fast as ashenhand.  I'm not sure what should be done to improve it, but I think it should be changed in some way to make it a desirable addition to the monks repertoire of disciplines, most of which are quite nice in my opinion.<P>I hope some of these issues are addressed, and I appreciate the effort that has gone into balancing the classes so that most people will be satisfied to a reasonable extent.<P>Ronne Obvious<BR>level 60 monk, Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Udila<P>Please dont post what you know nothing about.  You only serve to show your own ignorance when you do this.<P>But since some of the people reading the board may have the same understanding of the monk class as you do, I will take it as an opproutunity to explain.<P>First of all.  Feign death has been changed on post 35 mobs specifically is bugged several places.  Feign pulling does not work in the mid/later game as the monsters remember you when you pop up.  This utility does not exists.<P>There are some bugs in feign.  Sometimes, green mobs will not quit attacking on multiple successfull feigns.  A deepwater croc for example shouldnt still be biting you on your 9th successfull feign when you are level 44.<P>Sometimes after standing after a feign you are immobilized, and must sit and stand.  This often happens in conjunction with the aforesaid bug, and gets to sting if you are hit while you are sitting.<P>Moving on, to damage.  Monks were intended, according to the Vision, to be masters of mele, and were intended to outdamage a fighter when utilizing hand to hand.<P>Kunark changed that, and weapons came into the game.  Now monks are on par with fighters damage wise, and less than rogues.<P>This thread is supposed to be class balance.  IF the mele classes are balanced, one could assume that each would have a balancing attribute.  A possible way to look at this is consider you are in a balanced group and looking to add another member and are choosing between a monk, rogue and a warrior.<P>Warrior:  Good damage, Great Tank.<BR>Rogue:  Unmatched conditional damage, lesser defensive assets (hp, ac)<BR>Monk:  Good damage, lesser defensive assets.<P>One can see a viable toss up between the warrior and rogue (their strenghts and weaknesses are reasonably balanced).  What, however, would make you chose to pick the monk?<P>They can feign pull.  (no, we really cant past the mid game)<BR>They can save themselves in a fight.  (again no)<BR>They are the masters of mele and do more damage (well, we are supposed to, but we do no more damage than a warrior)<BR>They will become masters of throwing?!?!?  (God no!  Really, that is rogue area and veriant has stated time and time again that they dont want any class to be a stand off fighter)<P>There are a lot of suggestions in this post.  The crux of the problem i think has been stated and restated simply as:<P>If the monk class is balanced, what offsets their lack of defensive skills?  If our damage is increaced to offset this and move in line with how The Vision of monks has been explaind to us, how does this not become a death sentence due to the increaced agro and limited usefullness of our suposed safety net 'feign death'?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 8 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/053593-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053593&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=053593&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
