</FONT><HR>Zad s recommendations are great in order to balace out our class. But in order to make life much easier, please, pretty please, REMOVE ANY COPPER, SILVER AND EVEN GOLD off 50+ or 40+ mobs. I can hardly imagine the time saved by not throwing away all those worhtless coins when looting. Or just add a nocopper or no silver option to the loot command.That would be ez and much appreciated by the whole monk community.<P><BR>Petale monk 53 Prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I really really like the weight issue the way it is, it makes it more of a challenge for a trade off on what we can and can't do! <P>But can you do something about the Treant Fist's quest. For the level the Fist's can be obtained at, do you really need to make the alchemist outside runnyeye spawn so rarely? Is it a wonder almost no monks have these? Camping a total of 40+ hours for one spawn for a level 30ish fist quest that is semi decent doesn't seem right.<P>Stun would be cool. The damage above 50 I can't comment on since I don't know. The FD thing in a group is really odd though! Thats about it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Maybe if they had some way where they affected fist delay like celestial fists do, or give them something more than just 3Dex and 5HP.<P>Class armor: 2 words. More AC. Shiverback is pretty much a joke.

</FONT><HR>Absor....<P>My comments from my perspectives of my two monks (21 and 17 HUM/IKS respectively) and from the perspective of a post-50 cleric with a bunch of monk friends...<P>-------------------------------------------------<P>Comparisons of the three Melee classes:<P>We have rogue, warrior, and monk. I would like to say that I think rogue and warrior are well balanced. The rogue, in my opinion, is the supreme damage dealer in a group, not the warrior, or even the wizard. Properly equipped rogues outdamage every other melee, in my experience. On the other hand, warriors. Warriors do decent damage to mobs, even though that's not their true function. The explicit purpose of the warrior is to take all the damage from the mob when possible, and to that end they have extra HP's and incredible armor helping them out.<P>In my opinion, the current hierarchy is this:<P>Damage Done:<BR>1) Rogue<BR>2) Warrior(*)<BR>3) Monk(*)        <BR>(A properly equipped monk will outdamage a warrior, but it is far more difficult to outfit a monk than a warrior in the weapons department. Also, see my next point)<BR>Damage Taken:<BR>1) Warrior<BR>2) Rogue(*)<BR>3) Monk(*)<BR>I don't think monks are better at tanking than rogues. They have slightly better caps, but that is mitigated by the fact they take damage at all. Let me explain:<P>Rogues have Evade. Warriors have Warrior bonuses. These both mitigate Damage Taken. Monks have "Feign Death" except that that really doesn't help!<P>Warrior tanks, their job is simple. If a rogue gets agro'd, they will evade. A good rogue can stay almost entirely off the hatelist, and they will be swinging EVERY round. <P>A good monk will have to Feign (loosing a few rounds, possibly up to 1000 damage a fight (5 feigns)) while they wait for someone else's agro to build up. They can't be main tank, perhaps they are better than a rogue, but in a group situation they end up wasting cleric mana when they try to tank and there's a warrior present.<P>--------------------------------------------------<P>Conclusion/Comments:<P>I would like to see Monks get Parry, a fourth defense skill. This would help lessen the damage they take. I would also like to see the AC on a bunch of their equipment upgraded (Shiverback? hah!). If possible, give them third attack. And finally, and most importantly, give them a way to move up and down the hatelist WITHOUT halting their attacks. Discipline, Evade, whatever.<P>Their damage is comparible to a warrior, but their defense is not. Despite what Abashi said months ago, in my experience monks can and often are outdamaged by warriors (and this is post-50) and I believe that they deserve both an offensive and defensive increase, as well as an evade or discipline that will lower their agro.<P>A monk that is tanking when there is a warrior in the group is going to end up wasting the cleric's mana. A monk that can't stop tanking except by feigning is wasting combat rounds.<P>- Gaeb<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm also in support of Zadkiel's post. Those suggestions came about from a long, rational discussion and make a great point: give us a role again! I've been my monk since june of 1999. She's level 51, and has 58 days played. I don't play any other alts.  That list of suggestions addresses many of my concerns as an "old-school" monk.<P>Thanks for taking the time to read these.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>Ok problems I see :<P>Using *only* their melee weapons and no special abilities (even reflexive ones), monks, rogues and warriors will do almost the same damage with the same weapons ( jade maces are a good example ).<P>Add in the special abilities and we get:<BR>Monk<BR>Flying kick - flat damage increase not tied to weapon.<P>Warrior<BR>Critical hit - low percentile increase based on weapon.<BR>Triple attack - low percentile increase based on weapon.<BR>Kick - low percentile increase based on weapon.<P>Rogue<BR>Backstab - high percentile increase based on weapon.<BR>---<P>The problem is fairly obvious - flying kick is lagging drastically behind where it once was. While once providing an indisputable damage advantage over a warrior, it is now in many cases exceeded by the combined damage of critical hit, triple hit and kick/bash.<P>This means that for a monk to outdamage a warrior, they need better weapons, and the more powerful the weapon is to start with, the bigger the bonus for the monk weapon needs to be. This will continue to get worse the more new, improved, weapons are added to the game.<P>---<P>Miscellaneous points of imbalance :<P>Jade mace : ( 9/18 most powerful primary mid-high 1HB shared with monks, warriors, rogues, rangers )<P>Willsapper : ( 13/20 roughly equivalent to monk epic fists with powerful slow proc. )<P>Double backstab : completely bucking the trend of all velious disciplines, this ability has no cost or drawback, while providing a large increase in melee efficiency. In a token effort at "balancing" this ability, monks were given a potential 68 points of AC in the form of increased weight limits. <P>Assassinate vs Ashen Hand : Assassinate is another total freebie. It has no cost, it has no disadvantage, it is used 100% of the time.<BR>Ashen hand has a 72 min recycle, prevents you from using any other discipline, requires a weak untrained attack with a low cap, has a substantial chance of failure, provides no experience, leaves no corpse.<BR> <BR>Evade : the increased rogue damage would be impossible without it, monk damage signficantly exceeding warrior cannot happen without it.<P>Complete Heal : made free in the form of Donal's breastplates, it substantially lessens the relative tanking ability of every class except warrior. To add insult to injury, many uber encounters are "balanced" against raid groups having warriors tank with defensive and CH.<P>Discipline Defensive : uber mob encounters in SoV are balanced against this discipline. This means that any raid attempting to do without this discipline has almost no hope of success. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I had a whole bunch of stuff put in here but deleted it, it comes down to this.<P>Stats, prime stats for a class, make them mean something, if a monk has strength, stamina, dex, agility all 120+ his flying kick should be mashing, the thunderkick disentegrating....the same should apply for all classes to be honest...a warrior with a 200 strength would hit for 200 dmg at least.....if his dex, agility (hand eye) were around 80 the warrior might miss alot cause he could not time it right<P>Monks need dodge, parry, ripost, block tied into our stats, if a monk works hard and increases his stats it should count for something, casters, preist class get a direct increase in mana for casting off prime stats, wisdom, intelligence, agility directly impacts spell fizzle...none of the melee classes get this sort of stat to benefit ratio.....and this would provide for a lot of class balancing issues because the melee class the player would be repsonsible for his OWN stats and items use.<BR>- also, the weight limit needs to be tied into strength as a percentage of; rather than a set limit.<BR>- monk armors should be progressive in ac, crescent is lower ac than cured in all locations, kind of insulting actually (although if stats were fixed it would not be).<BR>- as an example of the stats issue, 127 agility, that is without trying, i can get agility as his as 145 with very little work though there would be some hard ac points lost...in RL, someone with that kind of ability would be doing trapeze, dodging knives, or be bruce lee.....would rate his agility around 150 or so, dex about 170, strength maybe only 120 but his skill, dexterity, agilty allowed him to attain results that a bull elephant would be jealous of.....so fix stats to mean something...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Also completely agree with everything Zad said.  I'd like to also add this to the comment of one of the people above me that it is much harder to properly outfit a Monk with weapons than a Warrior.  Now, not everyone may agree with me on this because it will make it easier to twink a Monk, but I think we all know how many twinks there are already.  I propose you make the drop rates of the Uber Monk weapons more common.  As it is, T Staffs and the like are just so darn rare that usually the only Monk that has one is the Wizard's level 2 Iksar or the level 60 Uber Guild Leader who already has his CF and doesn't use it anymore anyway.<P>Also, I already said I agree with everything in Zad's post but just thought I'd say anyway: change the minimum damage of FK.

</FONT><HR>I have played a Monk to level 33 and have made the following observations : <P>* Can we please have taunt, nothing is more frustrating than trying to get a mob off a caster through damage alone.  It doesn't seem too unfair, due to the fact that we are a melee class.<P>* Can we get some more graphics other than the "cured silk look",  would it be possible to have crescent have a different graphic set for example.<P>* At Level 33 there is no incentive to use hand to hand.  With a Sap of Piety or Fighting Baton you can do 10 pts more dmg per hit.  Would it be possible to up the dmg done in HtH?  Or perhaps a set of gloves that increase HtH dmg.<P>Thanks for you time,<P>Euchrid Ashenfist 33rd Level Monk<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The general consensus seems to be that while many of us may not be happy about it, monks have become, with Kunark, very much equipment dependent, and yet the loot/equipment available for the monk class does not reflect this.  More variety of monk equipment is a necessity.. more types of armor, some interesting stuff a-la the kunark right clickable armor for the rest of the melee classes.. more weapons as well - ach, we really need more weapon variety - unique monk only weapons.. wu sticks and knuckledusters are nice, not just for their stats, but because they are identity pieces for our class..  Make them monk only so we can capitalize on what is supposed to be our damage dealing edge without skewing the curves already in place for warriors/rangers etc.  <P>How about more haste items too, complimenting our role as damage dealer.. perhaps a line of monk only haste goodies starting with minimal effect low level items progressing through the mid level - not sure it's so needed at high level, as there do seem to be several choices availabel<P>But also.. don't forget the importance of fists - either consider retuning the damage/delay weapons of what should be our primary weapons, especially (but not exclusively) post 50, and/or capitalizing on the innovation of our epic Celestial Fists and adding in a monk only line of gloves that augment our barehanded damage and/or delay.<P>Other things (no less important.. sort of stream of consciousness here) (e.g. increasing our defensive skill caps to 252 for riposte, block, dodge), working on our special attacks to make them somehow all have their uses throughout our careers (and let us personalize our fighting styles).<P>I think the heart of what has monks so distraught is that our place, our role has been shaken up a bit.  Rogues are the undisputed king of melee damage thanks to backstab, and that is as it should be - monks however really don't stand out so well in contrast to warrior.  IF we outdamage them, especially at 60, we don't do it by any remarkable amount, and whatever the case, it does not even weigh remotely to what we lose to a warrior in defensive ability.  There are a lot of factors contributing to this, the fact that the level 50+ skill increases bring warriors very close to us with weapons, the fact that many monk type weapons also happen to be warrior weapons (canes of the tranquil at mid-high level, jade maces at high level etc, and the insane non monk exclusive stuff that's dropping in the uberguild zones of velious), the ineffectiveness of our fists in contrast to weapons etc...<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Another backing of Bodi's compilation....<P>And just to stress the main points:<P>Monk Damage:<BR>Rogues from behind are doing about 6000 Damage Per Minute, Wars, Mnks & Rog's from the front are doing roughly 2500 DPM with end level weapons.  Monks should be doing about 4000DPM.  And offhand dmg bonus for H2H seems to be the best solution fixing a few things along the way (Choice of hands vs. weapons, etc)<P>Monk Defense:<BR>Monk AC vs Warrior AC is supposed to be low, but the catch is Dodge, Riposte & Block are supposed to offset this.  The overall damage avoidance for monks needs to be raised.<P>Feign at higher Levels:<BR>Something is broken, the frenzy code is either wiping feigns or something else is causing previously successfully feigned mobs to reaggro while we're feigned.  There's already a fail check in the form of "XXX has fallen to the ground" any other form of feign failing is double jeapordy & overkill.   The exception being spell casting, as much as most monks dont like a spell breaking feign, they accept it adds some skill to pulling.<P>And I just want to point out 1 thing in regards to iksar/human; as I specifically asked in one of your earlier threads whether or not to post it, for fear of it being ignored later on.<P>Very simply -- Iksar Fists at 60 - 14/28, Human Fists at 60 14/26 (this is a balance point for the Iksar 40AC bonus).  Celestial fists on either a human or iksar are 9/16.  The H2H delay bonus should apply, giving Humans 9/15 fists would maintain the same ratio of the normal H2H differences.<P>-Fant, 56 Master, Tarew Marr.<BR>-Fendryl, 57 Troubador, Tarew Marr.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Only a couple things:<P>1) The selection of weapons at low levels is pathetic at best. Yes, we're best off barefisted, but at later levels, you either arm yourself or fall behind. This leads to a huge problem: Skill sits neglected. We need low-end, lightweight, non-magic weapons. Nothing major, probably something that would lag behind fists, but something we can practice 1/2hb with without pushing us over our weight limit.<P>2) Combining special attacks. C'mon, at least put fists(/tail) and feet on seperate cycles. I liked the idea someone else had of giving the special attacks a chance of "triggering" one of the lower-end attacks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think everything has been covered, but I can't reiterate ONE POINT enough..... Kudos Zaddy and Bodi...<P>Oftentimes, Feign Death is brought up as the single thing that innately balances monks.<P>At one point in time, I would have agreed with this.<P>But now, at level 58, I can tell you oen thing- the only times I *NEED* feign death in order to survive, it is *worthless*.<P>Any high level mob encounter (A prime example would be in Kael, fighting near the Arena), if the monk is getting beaten on in a hard battle, it seems that once a certain point is reached, *nothing* will get a mob off of you.<P>If you feign, succesfully, I might add.. no 'fallen to the ground' message, the mob will almsot ALWAYS, and I mean 90% or more of the time, continue hitting the monk.<P>I've tried running away, will be summoned back, and continue to run, then refeign... and the mob will chase me down or resummon me.<P>Feign does *nothing* to save you in such cases. Nothign at all, and I know this... I don't bank on it saving me anymore in times of dire need.  When do I feign most often nowadays? To go AFK, or if I'm playing around with a green mob or avoiding green mobs.<P>If Feign Death is to be considered an important aspect of the monk class, PLEASE- fix it. It is currently completely useless against a summoning mob once they decide that they want to have you for breakfast.<P>I'm not saying this is the only issue that needs to be adressed.. it's just one that hasn't been pushed forward enough.  All the other points made in Zadkiel/Bodi's compilation post seem to cover most of my other thoughts.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>(Oh.. also.. I've now killed over 100 skeletal warlords in Karnor's, and have yet to see a Tranquil Staff- if weapons such as the Tranquil staff are seriously considered in this 'balancing', while obviously powerful weapons for all melees (ie: Jade Mace) are not, it is imperative that the rarity of the Tranquil Staff, perhaps a more 'class defining' item than the Celestial Fists, and certainly mroe rare, decreases... they should be in the hands of more people if they are a serious factor in class balance.)<P>-----Derra Drunkenfist<BR>58th Master, Quellious Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"Make a MONK ONLY quest for a NO DROP 100% weight reduction bag that can carry 10 SMALL items. This would help a monk with a spot for food, bandages and some of the soulbound items that they now must carry."<P>--  I think that's a great idea.<P>Regarding armor and AC:  A few more points of AC on Shiverback wouldn't be too tough to do.  Was it intended that I ditch planar armor (that I fought harder and died a LOT more to obtain) for some of the new Velious armor?<P>Regarding FD:  FD is not the monk equivalent to Evade.   Use it to get singles back to your group.  Don't try to use it for something other than what it was intended.  If you're getting beat down after FDing because someone in your group did damage to the mob....blame your group.  FD != Evade.<P>Regarding weapons and damage:  I think we're fine.  If I wish to add the increased weight of a weapon, then I'm willing to accept the lower AC that it requires.  In some cases, I'll use a weapon for its proc if I've got a good tank that can keep the mob off me.  In others, I'll go straight H2H.  I like having the freedom and choice to make that decision.<P>That being said, I'd like to see the Tranquil Staff's proc fixed.  If I duel another player and use the Tranq staff, then when it procs that player spins in-place for a few seconds allowing me a few quick shots.   It doesn't do a thing against mobs other than the 120 damage.<P>Regarding balance:  I'm ok with we're at there.  But I've been a few duels, and I think the PvP monks might have some legitimate issues.<P>Regarding our special attacks:   I believe the damage range could be enhanced.   There are numerous suggestions as to how this should be done, and each has its own arguments.  If the dev team is unwilling to recode our min/max special attack damage, could they at least hide the Thunderous kick message if the damage is below 100?   Talk about embarrassing!  Try fighting next to a warrior (that you should be outdamaging) and seeing them get Crit Hits for 180-200+ while you "land a Thunderous Kick (24)".  *sigh*<P>Other than those, I'm loving playing a monk and I could care less what that OTHER monk (with the scaly skin) can or can't do better than me.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>CASTERS OWN MONKS!<P>1)  We have lower magic resistance than warriors.<P>Doesn't it make sense that since monks hone their bodies to be fighting machines, we would also have some inate ability to resist magics?  After all, it's much harder for us to find good resistance equipment anyway.<P>2)  We have no way to interrupt casting.<P>We can't even interrupt a 6 second Greater Heal spell (with 10 successful hits and a successful flying kick), what chance do we have against a 1 or 2 second nuke?  A wizard going toe-to-toe with a monk should hardly even bet able to get a spell off, let alone nuke the monk to a pulp in just a few seconds!  (This isn't just a L50+ issue.  Please can you add a stun effect to one of our lower level skills?)<P>My other points have been well made, but I'd like to add my support to the following:<P>3)  Please fix feign death in groups.<P>We need a way to get mobs back onto the main tank.<P>4)  Why was feign pulling nerfed post L35?<P>Verant want us all to move back into dungeons, and yet many high-level dungeons are almost off-limits if you can't single-pull all those casting mobs!  Since enchanters are in short supply, wouldn't it make sense to reinstate FD in dungeons?  Feign pulling is an artform and can be very satisfying - do we really need to go to all the lengths of 'tag pulling' and 'popping' just to be able to adventure into some of those hard-to-reach places without an enchanter?  If necessary, just reinstate FD in dungeons (where SoW isn't an option) but I don't understand what's so hideous about the tactic anyway, it's not as though it's easy to feign pull 2 or 3 casters!<P>Having not played the post L50 monk, I can't comment on many of the other issues but it does concern me that I can't even solo a green caster.<P>Flame on.<P>Srane Inmen.<BR>Saryrn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I mean, we really don't need to do the most damage, and we don't need more hitpoints, but this added healing boost would make us even more difficult to kill, and therefore more balanced.

</FONT><HR>Ok here is what I would like to see happen  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>1. Up the weight limit of 14 stone to something a little higher say 20.  Thats not that much of an increase to unbalance the game.  Maybe even add like every 5 levels it goes up 1 or 2 stone.  I give up carrying money, and don't even think about looting a fine steal weapon.<P>2. Feign Death.  It never ever works the first time you click it, the skill is sucessful but the mob will keep attacking.  It seems like you have to be a certain distance away, unless its a green mob.<BR>  -Another thing on feign death is the regen rate on HP.  Now think of a hospital, <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">, what postion are you in?  Laying down correct!  Why?  Because you use the least amount of energy, thus monks should have a regen higher than 1hp a tick when feigned, say 4hp? 5hp? maybe 10hp at lvl 60?<P>3. Fist damage/delay,  There has to be something done about this.  At lvl 30, the fists are 10dmg 34dly.  Now have you ever tried fighting something blue or even to you with your fists?  I'm talking without haste.  I don't think the fists are powerful enough to keep up with these weapons that monks *shouldn't* be using.  The best idea would be to give monks fists critical hits and or crippling blows, now you would see many more monks using there fists, instead of uber 50k weapons.<P>4. Flying kick, Why does it seem to hit for 3dmg most of the time?  I saw a post saying something which I thought was a really good idea.  Make flying kick hit for damage equal or greater than your level min.  Also i saw a post about this one guy was in marshall arts for a long time and this is what he said about flying kick.  Every flying kick that is done, its not 1 flying kick but 2.  So you kick him once while in the air than kick him again, like double flying kick.  And the 2nd flying kick is always higher damage than the first.<BR>  -Example: You flying kick a "" for 50dmg        You Double Flying kick a "" for 100dmg You have become better at double flying kick (161)<P>Just some things I thought of, that won't make the game unbalancing.

</FONT><HR>Propably all in this long thread but anyways I will voice my opinions.<P>1. Tripple attack, why warriors and not monks ?<P>2. Shiverback and monk plains armour in general, poor ac (ok we can handle that I guess), missing pieces (shiverback hat ?), poor stats, please put them inline with other classes stats resists or perhaps above since the ac is a joke.<P>3. Give us a reason to use our lowlevel special attacks. Maybe the level 1 kick (ie. same as warriors) can become stun kick at 55. Maybe round kick at some high level may cause a mob to be startled (mem blur proc like evade). Maybe Tiger claw at high level can cause a mob to bleed (a small dot). I dunno the whats and wherefors, but give us some reason to spend time working on all our skills. I think a skillful monk should be one that uses a combination of attacks not just flying kick. Other possible effects on the atatcks could be a taunt, a cancel magic and debuf (eg. trembles in fear, or we corked their thigh ;p )<P>4. Flying kick minimum damage... kicking for 3 seems a little lame. maybe minimum damge should be  (level - 27)<P>5. Thunderkick disc is well pretty sad. Perhaps all kicks for the length of the disc have a chance of being thunderous ? min damage on a thunder kick is sad also (but maybe fixing 4 would fix 5).<P>Overall tho I think monks are fun to play perhaps not that useful on uber mobs (ie. lack of a long lasting defensive disc). But overall not to bad and certainly don't need any major overhauls.<P>Monk damage output is definately way below a rogue, but only just above a warrior. And given monks need more exp (not to mention alot of us had the penalty on the way up) to level have way less hp, lower ac and discs that are less useful then a warriors (defensive and mighty strike rock), perhaps monk damage output could be made a bit higher.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

There's something seriously wrong with "Owynn lands a Thunderous Kick(23)!"<P>Reduce the delay on our special attacks.<P>Give us triple attacks, for the love of Quellious(sp?)!!! Why on earth would you give warriors triple attack and rogues double backstab and leave us hanging like that?<P>Let stats like dexterity and agility really mean something to us.<P>If you're going to force us to don heavier armor and weapons, drastically reduce our weight penalty.  To me, though, that's just bandaids on an open chest wound. You attempted to "balance" monks by forcing us to wield weapons.  To me, what made us special was our lack of reliance upon material things.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>     I would like to begin my post by saying that this is my first monk character, and my views may seem somewhat biased, but as a veteran of eq ( 2years now, wow ) I feel that they will be fair thoughts only posted.<P>1.  Monk H2H dmg.  Now, as the monk class was originally designed to be played via H2H combat, it seems that our H2H dmg/dly ratios are not much to talk about....I think 8/36 at lvl 20-25....and I think...well...thats horrible.  I mean if we are supposed to be dealing so much dmg with our bare hands, this is very inadequate, especially when you compare to other melee chars. who can very easily, no, undeniably, get weapons that far out do this dmg, at much, much lower lvls.  I think that an improvement in dmg/dly ratio would greatly benefit our class, and draw more young monks to use this skill ( I personally use 1hb and 2hb weapons ) otherwise I would be getting torn to shreds.  Fair thought.<P>2.  As mentioned in many posts before this one, the amount of weapons for monks ( and not all melee *monk* included ) is minimal.  True we do have our batons, and essense of dol, adam. bo stick etc...but in order to get these lower end weapons, we must be in our 30's, or have nice guild members or friends, we certainly cant afford them, seeing as to we dont loot often.  Also, above mentioned many times, the gap between batons/adam. bo stick== Wu stick/Wu staff is plain scary.  The 1k-2k jump to 9k and skys the limit is very hard on us.  I think that adding some weapons in between, and maybe some that monks can quest for ( go look at any site, and look up monk quests, ours are very limited, and shared by many.)<P>3.  More monk specific quests.  Plain and simple.  Maybe instead of making some of these above mentioned monk only items drop in extreme high lvl dungeons, give us some class specific quests so that we can *earn* our own...besides adding to the probable balance, it would add much to the fun factor and that we accomplished something on our own.  Seems fair.<P>4.  Me being only lvl 24 ( though not my highest lvl character )  I see that our attack skills ( round kick, tiger claw, etc) go unused after the next in line attained.  I agree with the other posters saying that maybe at higher skill lvls, or exp lvls. these skills could have an added affect, ex. stun, deadly strike ( take a % of hp).   I also think that as primary dmg. dealers that we have every right to have crits.  I mean why not, we are masters of these weapons we use, H2H primarily..supposedly...why not hit critical areas of our targets, its what we train to do our whole lives.<P>5. Last one.....at higher lvls. I beleive we should have more evading type skills.  Combat and non combat.  Like hide etc. and maybe one more in combat one, like, lets say...Anticipate.  As monks we learn our enemies head to toe, make it like riposte, but attainable at say lvl 45, and not go off as much, but do double damage, ( now this one is kinda wishful thinkin )<P>These are my thoughts, and I hope that they help in the development of this wonderful class.<P>Feilin Windweaver<BR>24 monk Quellious<BR>Sunrise Caster Clan </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>About more weapons and armor for monks....I thought monks were supposed to be the masters of not using that stuff?  Obviously a warrior is gonna have more tools to use than a monk,  that should be given.  And Warriors definitely do not do more damange than monks.  Flying kick easily jumps a monk ahead in damage almost no matter what he is using.  All in all I think a monk is a great class,  and always welcome in any group.   I don't see much of a need to change anything for the better.  Just my 2cp tho, I could be wrong.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Although I am only level 23 monk, I have read a lot and done some research, and I think I can address some issues that apply to monks 50-:<P>1) FD - I don't know if this changes at higher levels, but i have little problems saving my life with FD even in a group fight. You just have to turn attack off. Sometimes FD fails even when the "fallen" message doesn't appear. Just stand up and FD again, with attack off. It worked for me many many times. <P>2) The weight limit is fine, BUT! we HAVE to have our H2H damage/delay ratios increased so that it is at least comparable with the 1hb weapons available for our levels... examples? a simple Staff is 5/28, while a level 10 fist is 6/36... big difference, and at level 10 you can afford much better than Staff. Enameled black mace is 8/28, and a level 25 fist is 9/35. Again, who wields an EMB at 25? And then again the mighty fighting baton, equaled in efficiency by the level 45 fist or so... And I have one at 23, untwinked! So, how are we encouraged to use fists?<P>3) Fists again - isnt it ridiculous to have fist's delay over 30 even at level 50? I mean, a monk's fists should be quick, and quicker as you level. Decrease damage accordingly, but do something about the delay.<P>4) The way the monk is built makes players continuously search for armor and weapons... is this how it should be? the ac boost should be a bit bigger, and then again, those fists...<P>5) At higher levels, due to availability of good weapons for other classes, monks don't really outdamage a warrior. So... what is a monk good at then?<P>6) Other suggestions to make the monk class more enjoyable have been stated, such as a chance to stun with a special attack, a natural speed boost, lower than sow of course, procs of special attacks, innate haste of 10% or so... Don't have to consider them all, but think about what would come more "realistic" for a monk.<P>7) A "to-the-point" suggestion for fists damage:<P>lv 1: 3/28<BR>lv 5: 4/28<BR>lv 10: 5/28<BR>lv 15: 6/28<BR>lv 20: 7/28<BR>lv 25: 8/27<BR>lv 30: 9/26<BR>lv 35: 10/25<BR>lv 40: 11/25<BR>lv 45: 12/25<BR>lv 50: 13/24<BR>lv 55: 14/23<BR>lv 60: 15/22<P>Would that be overpowering? Please note that at each level there will still be some incentive to look for 1hb weapons, but not as much as now, and we would really outdamage the warriors, compensating for fewer HP's. However, rogues will still be champs of damage with their Backstab skill.<P>I hope this will be heard. If my suggestions are out of line, just tell me why  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Time for my 2 cents.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>First off, let me say that a lot of the posts I've read so far were great.. lots of serious thinking and work went into them.<P>We do need better defense, no question. I'd personally like to be missed a little more, maybe feel like the martial artist I'm supposed to be.<P>I'm going to focus on monk-only equipment, however. Whoever makes this stuff at Verant is just lost, if you ask me. I can't think of a monk who wears monk only stuff over ALL/ALL stuff, because almost 100 percent of the time, ALL/ALL is far better for a monk than monk specific. WHen I see someone wearing ALL/ALL equipment over the planar armor he has in the bank, well... Something is WRONG here, people. Doesn't take a blind man to notice this. WHy don't we take a look at what higher level monks are actually using, then make some monk only pieces with the same stats, but monk equip graphics? I don't want better than what I'm wearing, I just want my monk only stuff to be something other than totally useless. <P>Shall we mention that whoever makes 10 pound monk only weapons is cmpletely unbalanced. "I know, I must make solid stone weapons for a class that depends on light weight an mobility! That'll be successful!"<P>Please.<P>No monk only weapon should EVER weigh more than a pound, and I don't even want to hear the clap about 'It's a decision you need to make'. WHat decision does the warrior need to make about his damage output, other than which uber-weapon to use today? There are few enough killer monk weaps out there, they're stupidly hard to get, and then they blow right past the dinky 14 pound limit.<P>Fix it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Take a close look at Zad's post please, it is the surmation of much discussion on a large monk board.<P>Points I would personally like to emphasise...<P>*** FEIGN DEATH IN GROUPS ***<P>Something is seriously wrong with FD in groups at higher level... please investigate Absor, there *is* a bug here.<P>It's already been mentioned previously, to surmise, FD in groups at higher level is a *fraction* as reliable as solo. We know there is a bug here, please find and fix it, it's our core skill, we deserve to have it working properly.<P>*** MONK DAMAGE: Offhand damage bonus ***<P>If an offhand damage bonus were applied to fists, you've a safe, managable increase to Monk damage. You have no unforseen implications as to balancing it with weapons, as you know exactly how much extra damage it will mean to a Monk at any given level.<P>It also encourages Monks to use at least one of their fists.<P>*** MONKS WANT TO USE THEIR FISTS ***<P>Most people chose a Monk specifically because they wanted to play a particualr type of combatant, for lots of people this meant using their fists.<P>With the Monk epic, VI have resolved fist/weapons, please consider lower level alternative in a similar vein.<P>Which brings me to my next point....<P>*** MONKS DEPENDANT UPON RARE WEAPONS FOR DAMAGE ***<P>Monks not in a large guild reallt are up against it Absor, as we simply cannot afford or reasonably obtain weapons at high level to keep abreast of Warriors.<P>The Fighting Batons from Dalnir were a great move as it garenteed Monks of a certain level a certain amount of damage as they were easy to obtain.<P>Please consider something similar for levels 45 - 55.... Maybe someting 9/19 for peple finding it hard to get their mits around a Jade Mace.<P>We also need better 2H Blunt options, or greater drops on current 2H Blunt options. At 48th I have yet to be anywhere near a viable 2H Blunt.<P>*** TAUNTING MONKS WITH HIGH WT ON THEIR ARMOUR ***<P>Ummm, please stop being cruel  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Kindly consider halfing the weight on Cured and Regular Tizmak, and Black Panther Armour... the ac on them isn't over the top, and would simply suply a viable, but still reasonably heavy slight upgrade for Monks in Vellious.<P>I think if you look at the numbers on these items you will see halving the weight wont overpower them by any means... a modest request.<P>*** CHAINED ATTACKS ***<P>Unhookingthe special attacks post 50 would be really kool Absor... we might actually get to look like martial artists  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>A common theme is we really want to be able to use our "dead" special attacks... most Monks really are into their character, we chose Monk for a reason... the idea of a flurry of special attacks I think is great!<P>*** IN CONCLUSION ***<P>I think if you look back over the more in depth posts presented here you will see that Monks don't want to be godly, we dont want to tank better than Warriors, or deal more damage than Rogues, we simply want to be secure in our role.<P>Since Kunark our position has been eroded, and to some degree this might have been necessary, but it's starting to get on the worrying side.<P>At the moment a lot of the high performance drops for Warriors and Rogues in Vellious are rare as hell so dont really pull class balance one way or another.... in short order they will become more common, and will become an issue.<P>Oh and as a last comment... please buff Pallies and SKs Taunt, even if up to near Warrior level. These chaps deserve to be able to fulfil their role the same as us.<P>Consider upping the Ranger offences and damage, this Monk appreciates that they need a role as damage dealers... and their very low defence means they aren't about to challenge the melees.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
