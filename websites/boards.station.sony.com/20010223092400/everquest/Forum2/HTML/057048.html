Essentially, we are adjusting the level at which some of their spells are attained to make them more in line with their power.<P>Here is a list that I, once again, stole from Everlore because I'm lazy and because it seems accurate:<P>a) Add Endure Cold at 22<BR>b) Add Skin Like Nature at 59<BR>c) Add FireFist at 22<BR>d) Move Bramblecoat from 49 to 39<BR>e) Add Spikecoat at 49<BR>f) Add resist cold at 55<BR>g) Add Panic Animal at 22<BR>i) Offense and weapons skill made identical to warriors<P>Let's talk about these changes and others that might be needed to 'balance' rangers.<P>Keep in mind that I primarily want to talk about 'balance' here. I'll certainly list any bugs that you would like to see addressed, but the focus should be balance. And please be concise when responding. These threads will get very long, and it helps me to be able to read all the responses if they are to the point.<P>Let's hear what you have to say.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Actually, it IS the post 50 rangers that should be complaining. If played right, your ranger can be great. I play a level 31 ranger, and I easily do lots of damage in groups. I do about 40 damage average pulling with arrows. While its running, I dot for 120. Damage shield the main tank. He gets hit about 20 times per battle. Theres 180 damage. I do 100-200 melee, add another 150. I can do some minor buffs like skin like rock, str, and agi. One thing I can say is you are NOT a tank and will never be one. Warriors, paladins, and SKs can do that. Rangers are more like a monk or rogue, doing damage out to the side while others take damage. You can easily do 400-500 damage in one battle at level 31! So I really think it IS the post 50 rangers that need a few things like Jolt fixed. But before 50, you can deal some serious damage! And with minor healing spells and snare, you are even better. 39 is a good level to get sow, about half way through the game (or what I have heard). You can hope for ports, but they wont be added, I never thought rangers to be THAT magical, they are supposed to be lightly armored and agile (the agile part I still have yet to see) while still being able to cast minor spells. <BR>Just never try to tank, you have minor armor abilities so you take the opening hits while the tank taunts off, or take damage when there is more then one creature. I think the pre 50 ranger is a great addition to any group. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>bind- yes. Rangers are by definition an outdoor based, travelling oriented class we should at some level be able to self bind only. i dont see how this could unbalance the game.<P>gate -no. Nowhere in any Sword and Sorcery that i have ever read does a Ranger type character have this ability. we go on foot,if we go.We don't gate.<P>SoW-Rangers being an outdoor based class, and with lower HP that some other arguably warrior based classes, ought to get SoW, even a short duration SoW effect spell at lvl 15 or so.We are a travelling, explorer base class. we need to be quicker,sooner.<P>Archery-fix it, please.for everyone.<P>Panther form / Bear form-ha.ok, give 50+ plus Rangers rat form.that will teach 'em.<P>an additional attack spell such as ice rift would be nice at lvl 9 or 15. please.<P>a Ranger 50+ quest item to be added,"Rangers Rag of Crying" maybe to be added , effects would be 5 charges of panther form, 5 charges of self gate.<BR>Graphic in game to look like large fluffy cryin' towel.<P> Rangers at early levels , are too heavy in banded to move fast, hence the request for a low lvl , brief duration SoW effect type spell. Not all Ranger issues are post 50, they just cry the loudest. i guess cause they have had more levels to get their skill up in this discipline.<P> i think it is like dual wield or double attack, i can't put any end of level points in it to start bringing my skill in it up yet cause i haven't hit level 50 yet.<P> i think i'm gonna drop mine in archery or something useful tho.Seems like a waste of good ability points to me,but apparently some view it as an essential skill.<P>           go figure-<P>              Naz<P>p.s- test server changes are hot, implement them,they are all good.<P>               </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, My confidence in Verant actually fixing Rangers is such that I just deleted my 56(almost 57) ranger. Yep, after 1 year and change playing. Basically 57 levels of me banging my head against the wall. I just got sick of it.<P>Wish 56.9 levels ago someone had informed me that I was playing the "red-headed step-child" of EQ classes the way Verant sees it. Woulda saved me a lot of time, aggravation, grief.<P>So in a rather resplendant display of "screw you verantness" I placed every item I had that wasn't no drop into my bags, and dropped them right in the middle of the zone in at Karnors. (where they were sucked up faster than I could drop them) Then butt naked  - except for my epics I charged the Warlord room and died there.<P>Then logged and cancelled both my accounts.<P>Verant has made it quite apparant recently, in the high level game, that unless you are a Warrior, Rogue, Cleric, Evacer, or Enchanter you aren't wanted. Sk's and Pali's now have some relief that they have summon corpse and XP rez.<P>I have little faith that Verant will give us more than token fixes.<P>There are better games coming down the pike. I'll spend my cash someplace that:<P>1. Has balanced classes<P>2. Has decent, polite, consistent, and semi-inteligent customer support. (4 GM's giving me 4 diffent versions of what a "compensatable death" is, is not enjoyable - especially when the bug is easily verified within 2 minutes)<P>3. Has management that understands the concept that if 100% of customer base Y says X is broken. Odds are that X is broken, not that 100% of customer base Y "is playing their class wrong".<P>4. Understands that putting an epic drop on a mob that drops the best legs in the game - that "Uber guilds" will be farming for eternity - instead of a triggered spawn is well... stupid. Guilds are selling the stones for Multi-Questing for 10-20kpp each.<P>Shugamayatu Mistreaver 56 ranger of karana, Innoruuk server (deceased)<BR>Sildawenu Lifespinner 37 Cleric of Tunare (deceased)<BR>Straferd mistreaver 21 warrior (playing his last quarter out)<BR>Maltos Shugardaddy 21 Cleric (playing his last quarter out)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Give it up guys, we have been told here and other places.The Ranger talks are being skimmed at best,skipped at the worst.<P>I can see whats coming , or more correctly , whats not coming for Rangers. As a hybrid...our recent Exp. changes are going to be considered as big improvements for a Ranger : Its an improvement in the same way that a "by-pass" is an improvement to a blocked artery(does nothing for the cause of the probem). Rangers are going to get a pre-determined set of small improvements and will still be the biggest group liability in the game : In other words the group Cleric will still be saying "anybody,but a Ranger". I cancelled 2 accounts the other day, not only cancelled, but gave away all my things and  deleted all the characters,so I couldnt change my mind. One account didnt even have a Ranger on it.<BR>I just wont pay for this kind of C.S. anymore.<BR>The only way it might ever get better , is if more <BR>people decide as I have.<BR>"Verant will treat you exactly the way you allow them to" <P>Rangers will get: <BR>1.Sow a bit eariler<BR>2.A lowering of some spells (level to aquire,I   mean,might also add upgrade to Kitty feet)<BR>3.MAYBE - a slight increase in Def.<BR>4.A promise of a tracking upgrade ( we have had   that promise before) <BR>5.

"make them happy for a while" stuff, fletching,<BR>    etc.                   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I hope you see that rangers are unbalanced and only second rate in groups, the best way i can see to fix this is make an indoor harmony spell, level 39 or so. I understand it would probably have to be slightly resistable, but this would make rangers wanted at least as a 2nd rate puller/decent dmg dealer in a group. <P>thanks for your time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>From what i read. All we really need is a better sow and better dodging skills (including evade of course). We are just like rogues, but we have spells and attack almost as hard as warriors minus the critical. <BR>And yes, archery is almost useless. I don't even bother to train it and fletching is just an annoyance having to click and drag so much. <BR>I'm a lvl 25 ranger btw. I'm find our ability to avoid taking damage is really making it hard for us. I know we can solo pretty good since i power lvled from 2 lvls in a single day because my cleric friend was nice enough to heal me at the mill in lake of illomens.<BR>We CAN do good damage and pretty fast at that. Just that we should be about to dodge (pardon my choice of words, this have nothing to do with the dodge skill) more and avoid taking damage. Note i meant AVOID, not able to take MORE damage. Rangers are basically treehuggers, they don't like plate too much and are more agile than powerful. <BR>To sum it up, we need better dodging caps and abilities with sow. As well as some advancement from other classes regarding archery. THat's pretty much i think we REALLY need, not want nor wish. <BR>Note: i'm a newbie of the game(2nd mth). But i could tell we are just a patch away from being just right. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Defence<BR>-------<P>Really the only upgrade rangers need is a balancing of defence cap.<P>Even in an RP sense an increase to ranger defence can be justified. Rangers are supposed to be agile and good at avoiding hits. Partly due to game mechanics this pretty much has to take the form of a defence cap upgrade but an upgrade to post 50 Dodge Parry and Riposte would not go amiss.<P>Upgrading offence does not help the rangers problems. Really it just makes it worse.<P>Changing Jolt.....urgh in many groups this spell is gonna kill your enchanter, clerics or casters anyway. The whole idea is that a ranger should be able to take some hits.<P>Archery<BR>-------<P>Archery damage could be increased by 50% and most rangers would still do more damage easily in melee than stepping out and firing some arrows.<P>The height issue should be relaxed a little.<P>Trueshot at the moment is a wasted disc. It was great for a while. But now I dont know many rangers that even bother to use it.<P>Rangers are a great class. A great idea for a class. Yet at the moment even with the best armor in the game for a ranger taking any hits in a post 50 group is very hard.<P>The suggestion to up HP's into line with Paladins/SKs is a nice one but its the defence upgrade that will really make the class playable again and fun to play.<P>Zacarius 54 Wizard<BR>Pantheus 55 Cleric<BR>Guild Leader Phoenix Crusaders on EMarr<P>RL husband to <BR>Serafina 56 Ranger</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well I am just a baby ranger at level 22 and its my first character so I wont pretend to understand all the high level debate. It does strike me, however, that one of the major problems seems to be the ranger role in a group situation and our apparent lack of usefulness when put up against other melee classes. So hows about as that special ranger ability which we lack, we go for something which actually makes sense in role playing terms. <P>I keep seeing people justifying their wish for Sow, gate etc in terms of 'hey were rangers outdoor travel is our thing so we should get Sow, gate etc'. My view is somewhat different - a ranger should be skilled at outdoor stuff not because she can cast some spell, but becuase its a real leared skill. I dont think being a ranger justifies us having early Sow or gates, I already like the fact that travelling is made a lot easier with track (a skill which will I am hoping become more useful with the promised changes) and sense heading (do all classes get this skill by the way?). Yes I would like some kind of outdoor bind because in role playing terms, I see no reason why I should only be bound to cities and also it just gets frustrating having to constantly ask for it - though thats a problem for all melee classes I guess.<P>Anyway, in terms of a class defining skill and something that would make us more popular in groups, I was thinking along the following lines. As a ranger I should be more aware of my surroundings than others in my group. It should be my job to scout out the landscape, be able to sense danger earlier (track) and also be able to devise escape routes and successfully lead a group to safety during a retreat. So hows about we get a skill (not a spell) which replicates the ability for us to successfully lead our group to safety in the great outdoors and to find a safe hiding spot/cover our tracks etc. The mechanics to replicate this skill would simply be the same as a brief hide spell and a loss of mob aggro on the group. It could be a once a day skill and probably wont always be successful, but it would give us a good way to deal with over pulls in a group situation and more importantly would be in keeping with us being rangers.<P>I would also go along with the wishes of many others for an improvement in the archery skill. I dont really understand the argument about it being manaless, and so poor damage. If thats such a worry dont allow us to carry so many arrows at one time, maybe just the components (and yes I would love to be able to forage my own components), so our down time comes in terms of sitting down and making new arrows. I have seen a lot of other really good ideas so far on archery/fletching and it really would for me make being a ranger special for my prowess with a bow to be something to be proud about. Especially since I have spent all of my earnings for the past 12 levels on increasing my fletching skill and have finally made my trueshot bow - only to find that it makes very little difference to the way I can play my character.<P>thanks for reading</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Hi all,<BR>First off I do believe that Rangers need some balancing and I have been posting such for a LOOONG time, so here is my 2 cps worth. Please note I have played many other classes and compared to them we are in need in deed.<BR>A) Bow delay needs to be improved, why: we are the master of the bow yet we are constantly outdamaged by warriors and SKs with their damage reverse kitting abilitys. How: Have an 8 slot quiver, Ranger only, with 3 questable gem inserts, have each gem subtract 2, then 4 then 6 delay from any bow. Make quests appropriate to the Lvl obtainable say 25,35,45. Please note that while this will let us kite a bit better we would still be WELL below the other kiting classes in ability. Also I would make arrows NOT be auto equipable without them being in a quiver.<BR>B) Bow damage needs some improvement: Why see above. How: When you are able to fletch bladed arrows let them also be a DOT, reason, why do hunters use bladed arrows, they bleed out the animals. This would improve our damage output in a small non game unbalancing way. <BR>C) We are considered mana sinks by everyone in the game, Why: we have really no way to get a mob off us. How: There is a spell called Sunbeam, druid, Lvl 24. Let it be an Agro list neutralizer, IE let it have a 1.5 cast time 5 sec duration and the mob is Blinded and the person that casts it has its agro lowered to the bottom of the list. Monks have FD as do SKs, while Rogues have evade, as we are somewhere between the Hybrid warrior and the damage dealers this would improve survivability and be more group friendly(object of game), This would put us on a similar lvl with them, BUT it would also use up a valuable spell slot (Balance/Tradeoffs).<BR>D) Sow should go to 30 but I feel this is a moot point now that Shamans have 10 potion sows out.<BR>E) Move harmony to 9 from 22, Why: This is a very valuable spell but many people dont use it. At 9 it would enable you to start with mob groups in Crushbone, W. karans bandit camps, W. Commons and N. Ro Dervish camps. This would be a valuable tool in groups, encourage grouping and teach rangers how to use a spell. Make it castable indoors. Why: Encourage grouping in dungeon crawls, someplace we are really not welcome (Balance issue).<BR>F) Swap careless lightening for Frost strike (Shaman Lvl 24) Why: Bit more damage but this is appropriate to the lvl (39) that we get these spells, 99 Damage is getting too low here and considering the spells/abilities other Hybrid classes get not unreasonable.<BR>G) Move immolate to 39. Why: this spell is an improved flame lick, has high resistance from mobs due to its dual nature and at 39 would be lvl appropriate but by the time we get it its way to late to be truely effective, not game upsetting at 39 (Balance issue) Would with harmony being indoors make us more rounded Re: indoors group welcome.<BR>H) Change ALL our heals to regenerate type heals. IE: would go with the class as we are foragers and perhaps have a common, stackable componant we would need. Why: We are Rangers, woodsman, we SHOULD be able to make poultaces for wounds and this would make an interesting ingame class only type RP ability.<BR>I) Increase Dodge ability. Why: we wear light armour and should have a fairly high Dodge ability and this would increase our combat survivability (Balance). Increase no other skill. reason: we do NOT train in the combat arms as much as Paly and warriors so IMHO we should not be NEARLY as good as them.<BR>J) Double the effect of Feet like cat and put Spirit of Cat at 49. These 2 abilities would increase our HPs but are spell slot users, and it looks like verant is wanting us to be spell dependent.<BR>K) Add Spirit of Ox at 49. Why: This would increase our stamina and make us better in combat. We are supposed to be high damage output fighter types, this would enable us to keep doing that. (Balance issue).<BR>ok thats my vision (LOL) of changes that while improving the Rangers as a class and putting us more even to some of the other classes, are not game balance upsetting and would make us more likly to get into groups as we lvl up. Please note that I have addressed the Ranger balance problem at all lvls not just post 50. We are high damage output fighters now and get aggroed alot as it is and with getting the "Fists" spell at 22 this would only increase the problem without addressing it. In addition I would remove the DOTs we do get in order to get the Bladed arrows have a DOT ability, And make Ranger only fletched arrows have that ability with an Imbue spell type line. Makes it worthwhile to continue with the fletching skill.<P>Elgor NachtSchritter on the Q<BR>Master Tracker<BR>Master Archer<BR>Master Fletcher<BR>Drunken Brewer (Gotta test it)<BR>Companion of Jadeyes the Everlost<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello Alan,<P>I would like to see a bind npc in every city that will cast bind on a individual for a cost of 5 or more platinum (the cost should be provibitive enough to encourage people to search other players out for binds).  This is specifically for those times melee characters or young ones are not able to find anyone in the zone due to the hour, or the city being Erudin  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>These npcs would tied to the city guard's faction.<P>As for rangers, I am at a real loss to ask for specifics because rangers really are secondary citizens post 50, and I think this is actually due to their limited useful group oriented skillset and not a single aspect of the character that you can focus on.  The best thing I have seen recently is the addition of the trueshot discipline.  It helps rangers bring something substantial to a group raid.  I don't believe it goes far enough currently though.  I would love to see the trueshot discipline have a much increased damage output, or a decreased re-use time.<P>Thanks for your time and consideration,<BR>Andre, ranger, Cazic-Thule<P>p.s.  No melee character should get gate unless it is tied to a specific high level item.  I am fine with things the way they are now (except for Velious) where a ranger with a Trakanon breastplate can get anywhere in kunark or the old world in 20 minutes or so (port to faydark, sow run to butcherblock and catch the boats to timorous deep, levitate sow run to the firepot room).<P>I would like to see more firepot rooms around, not gate spells for meleers.  Again, this is not biased based on class so it doesn't enter into class balancing issues.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, we're being asked for our feelings on balancing our class, yet get told that we aren't properly playing our class?  Who knows better how to play rangers than those of us that have been doing it constantly for 50+ lvls now?<P>Many of the upgrades are easily within the scope of being "proper" for the class:<P>Self Bind:  <P>Being the woodsmen of the game, we should be able to spend more time out in our beloved woods and not bound to some city.  Create a self only "Call of the Woods" spell that binds us in outdoor zones only.  We aren't made for dungeons, but this would help considerably.<P>Archery:<P>Ok, we invested all that time and effort developing our fletching skills.  We've practiced long and hard on our archery and raised it to that 150-200 range.  We now spend 7-10pp per 20 arrows to make those nice dmg6 - dmg8 arrows.  Now, we proceed to miss...miss...miss..... dbl dmg hit for 2 dmg.... miss.... miss.  Let's see the masters of the bow equiped with a viable archery skill to use in combat.  incorporate a stunning blow, crippling blow, killing blow into our archery skill.<P>Offense:<P>We are mini-tanks, we step right in and dish it out with everyone else.  Rangers do damage!  Yeah, we're impressed with the warriors and monks, but we'll go toe-to-toe when we have to.<P>Defense:<P>We are a "lightly armored" class.  We'll never have to pure armor ac we'd like to have.  But being the nimble woodsman we are, we should be able to get out of the way of some of those haymakers L50+ mobs like to dish out.  Improve our chances to dodge/evade some of that damage.  Groups don't discriminate rangers cause we can't do damage, we get discriminated because we can't take the dmg or have the hp to support the dmg we do take.  <P>Spells:<P>Another improvement for the dmg issue would be a chance at a regen spell. SOmething that might stack with other classes, and help facilitate grouping "Woodsman's Cure?"  Yes, a class specific form would be a nice plus.  Wouldn't  solve the balance issue, but might quiet the dissension.  Might be good to incorporate it with added defensive properties.  Upgrade some of the spells for rangers, we're already limited on the amount of mana we use, becomes an issue of mana vs ac, but we definitely could use a better DOT, and some others.  The added prot. vs cold spells are also a welcome addition.<P>Will a self bind ruin the EQ economy? I don't think so.  Will it make it easier for us to group? Definitely.  Will a class specific skill for rangers make us more play-able?... ie Archery, specialized Tracking.... Yes.  Will added defensive abilities balance us for groups? Yes.  The question now becomes:<P>Will these suggestions be taken to heart?<P>Will these things that truly seem to fit with what "being a ranger" is be implemented?<P>Will this post be read by anyone other than other rangers?<P>Only time will tell.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've been reading through the posts of these exceptionally long threads and we can pretty much all agree that Rangers either need better defense or a better damage avoidance method (ie evade).<P>Yes, Rangers are penalized at least FOUR times for being the offensive hybrid (Lower HP Base, Lower AC Base, Lower Damage Avoidance, Lower AC Armor).  And people can say anything and everything they want about all of these, but the fact of the matter remains that we have no greater ability than a priest class to take damage.  So, while it may seem like I am beating a dead horse, Rangers need an increase in defensive skills equal to the other hybrids (Knights and Bards) increase in Offense.  That's a fair and just reciprocal parity.<P>On the other hand, I had a thought on something new to add to the Ranger class, since all of the bad press players have given us has certainly hurt our groupability.  Give Rangers a limited Effect Indoor Harmony.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have read all the posts, at least in brief. Yes, all six threads. Frankly, I am fairly bored with the same old posts. And the solution to our problem is not to snag other's skills as our own, but to devise new skills. The suggestion for the group hide as a once a day skill on par with harm touch and lay on hands was excellent. One last thing:<P>Although I have several levels before I receive the spell that makes your weapon proc, I see this as the most appropriate direction of Ranger change. <P>Instead of being 25% druid and 75% warrior -<P>(and I know some of you are snickering because you think we're only 50% warrior - give it a break, it's not exactly helping our situation)<P>- make our parent classes actually meld. Give us a spell for a small DD weapon proc. Give us a spell, mana consuming, that makes arrows proc. Or make every arrow consume mana. Or give us a bind good for only a SINGLE death(ie, you die once, you go back to your bind place. You die a second time, you go back to your original bind place. This would make it so rangers couldn't just bind themselves at a battlefield and constantly throw themselves at the mob over and over - and make it EXTREMELY mana consuming) <P>To sum it up, instead of giving us mediocre druid spells, give us spells that enhance our melee ability. Firefists is also an excellent example.<P>Anyway, I don't even know if these posts are being read still, but I hope they are. Please consider this shift in paradigm. <P>Kincaidia<BR>35th Ranger<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OK, let's admit upfront that a good portion of the threads in this six-page discussion are well above my weight as a newbie to EQ and the Ranger quest. But a couple things seem odd to me as a longtime (20+ years) RPGer regarding the ranger class.....<BR>1. Archery. Why are the masters of the woodlands amazingly bad at archery? With a high-quality bow, good arrows and decent archery skill, I still miss low-level critters better than 50% of the time, and frequently hit for 2-4 points of damage. Seems a little odd.<P>2. Woodland creatures. It seems like we get neither of the two "traditional" ranger benefits -we are not master hunters; and we are not able to befriend or charm these animals in any way. How about an "animal companion", a charm animal spell for the second option, or an enhanced ability at getting useful items (better pelts, etc) out of the corpses of animals we hunt for the "master hunter" option?<P>3. Grouping. I keep hearing lots about how rangers can't match warriors, can't match paladins, can't match clerics, etc. Well, I came into the game expecting that rangers would be the typical aloof solitary woodsman type, perhaps occasionally assisting city-folk with guiding and tracking skills, but only associating regularly with other Rangers and Druids. Maybe something along those lines could be implemented? Rangers used as point-man/scout initially, then (with enhancements to Archery) used as missile-comabt support after battle is joined?<P>4. Woodlands vs. Cities. For being hearty outdoorsmen, it is awfully weird that we have to A)Get a third party to cast "Bind Affinity" on us and B) Have to have it cast on us in a city, of all places. A better solution would be the ability to do a self-bind in maybe 4-6 wilderness areas around the game world, so we are not doubly penalized by lack of self-reliant quick movement and our inability to bind ourselves to a new location.<P>Just the thoughts of a long-time DM, on ways to enhance the class. I, for one, love the game and will continue playing it whether these items are addressed or not. They just seem to be ways in which the playing experience could be improved!!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have 2 accounts. One for me and one for my kid.<P>I am also waiting to see if we get a class defining skill, or a skill that would make a group want us. <P>I am having the most fun with my ranger right now at lvl 40. I just got alot of really neat spells and can do alot of damage. <P>Right now everyone loves my taunting ability. But later I could see it being a problem. <P>I dont see my HP or AC climbing anymore at all does it just slow drastically at lvl 38 for all classes or is it just rangers?<P>But I dont think we even come close to the damage of a Monk or warrior, Maybe because my weapons aren't twinked from a lvl 50+ mob. Since the weapons make the player. <P>So unless you are twinked don't even think of starting a Ranger as your first character.<P>If Rangers dont get any help I will delete my account and let my kid play the other unless he gets bored of his warrior. Which I kinda think he is starting to ;-). He wishes he had a ranger for the spells, then he reads the problems with groups at higher levels and changes his mind cause he really wants to fight dragons one day.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Did anyone ever stop and think about the HP issue?  What is the difference between rangers and knights?  Why is it we are hearty outdoorsmen and we have less HP?  And before you get in my face and state we are a "light" tank, that applies to the armor, not our HP.  I am sure some here have played D&D before.  All the fighter classes have basically the same hp.  I agree that warriors should have the most.  But why do we as rangers get singled out as having weak HP.  It makes no sense.  Give us the same HP as knights.<P>Also has anyone noticed that most of the changes implemented on the Test Server do NOT address post-50 rangers.  I think this is just another slap in the face to rangers everywhere.  Rangers pre-50 are a good class.  Post-50, the only way I get into groups is when any class will do.<P>Chasmyr Trueplaya<BR>54th Ranger</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1. No class can taunt mobs off of Rangers. We seem to always be the target of the mobs. We cannot handle that damage well and it causes us to die or at least completely drain our healers of mana. If you take the Ranger out of the group and replace with any other melee then the group is more efficeint on mana and damage output.<P>2. This is even more painfull to Rangers on uber raids like when fighting Velkator. If a Ranger decides to attack we usually agro these types of mobs quickly no mater what weapons we use and we cannot survive long enough to even get a heal from our healers. Even if I turn attack off on the first hit from such mobs I die from the next 3-5 hits comming my way before a tank can taunt it off me or healer can heal me. Again replace Ranger with other melee class and they can survive long enough to do damage get heals and actually provide something to the raid. Replace Ranger with a caster you get damage heals etc..<P>3. Almost all Uber mobs resist my Epic and all of my spells so I am not a viable spell caster on these raids and if I actually attack the mob with my swords he kills me before I can do 700 damage to them and they have 200k HP meaning I did nothing to help my guild kill the mob except maybe take off one regen tick.<P>4. My Dots and buffs are overriden by all class dots and buffs meaning they are useless to me when grouped.<P>5. I actually do more damage when not using trueshot than I do using it now. Unnurf it please.<P>6. I add nothing special or unique and lack the special porting abilities of my parent class Druid.<P>7. I cannot solo well I do not have enough mana and AC HP to nuke nor melee or mix both to solo blue mobs and I am left out of groups because of the above mentioned disabilities. <P>8. My root does damage causing me to get constantly summoned to level 51 mobs so I am not a viable crowd control class <P>Give us dodge parry reposte increases and give us the rest of our balance from our Druid parent by giving us improved (not same line) Dots and some of there porting abilities.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The Pre-50 Rangers dont fully comprehend it but they will unless something is done to the Ranger post-50 defense problem.<P>Verant stop playing games and adjust our natural AC/HP (higher defense cap and more HP per level) and lower the level requirement for Jolt.<P>It is ok to admit when you are wrong.

Buffs require mana, buffs wear off at the wrong time, buffs need to be refreshed, buffs can be dispelled, and buffs require valuable buff slots, which are limited.<P>With that said, however, we've gotten some pretty fine buffs.

</FONT><HR>For group apeeal, Call of Earth and Str of Nature are just plain awesome.  My groups normally make me keep those 2 buffs on the tanks.<P>But I wasnt talking about group appeal, I was talking about survivability.  I think rangers have quite a bit of group appeal, it is just we tend to be a hassal on the group because our hps get sucked away so quickly and our taunt is absolutely enormous.<P>Like I said, I appreciate the changes on Test and want to see them go live.  I would just also like to see a few final things go in, a defense cap increase and Jolt lowered.<P>Oh yea.... And where are my tracking changes?

</FONT><HR>Merely lowering Jolt in level is insufficient, I'm afraid.  I admit that it would have been nice to have had Jolt when I was in my low 50s (I don't think it necessary before 50, really), but the problem is that it only takes one mob that has 100%, or even just a high MR to completely invalidate the spell.<P>Jolt is far far to critical a part of high level Ranger survival for these resists to be happening like they do.  The spell should, at the least, have its resistance lowered to Lure levels but more than likely should be changed to an unresistable spell.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>There are only a few things that will really make any difference for high level rangers.<P>1. HP.  No reason we shouldn't have =pally hp.  NOT warrior hp, but Pally.  <P>2. Def.  10-20pts in def OR fix CoE so it stacks better.  if CoE was self only but stacked with everything it wold fix the problem right there.<P>3. Jolt.  needs ot be at LEAST lure level resist based, if not dragon roar level resists.<P>haveing 200ac less than a pally (if they get 250def this WILL happen) is unreal.  Add to that the fact that some shamen of a level or 2 less then me have MORE HP than I do is just wrong.<P>Again<P>RANGER HAVE = &lt; HP then SHAMEN.  not Pally's no warriors, a caster..  Some clerics, and mages are not far behind.  CASTER HP ARE FOR CASTERS.  All HYBIRDS should have the same basic HP pool, modified by STA.<P>Again #1 is about 10x more important than anything else.  This and actaully adding the new tracking stuff to be as good as it was said it was going to be, would really be enough.<P>Your doing alot for the 40-50 rangers which is good.  but NOTHING on your list will help me at 60th level at all.
