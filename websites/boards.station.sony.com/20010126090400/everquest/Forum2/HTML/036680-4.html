</FONT><HR>A while back, a patch said that NPCs were enhanced to be able to respond to new actions. The way I see it, this change is simply a response to the action of /corpse-ing someone elses body that has been coded into some NPCs of Velious.<P>Probably, some script like the following was attached to the NPCs in the faction-based zones:<BR>---<BR>IF I can see you<BR>AND you drag someone else's corpse<BR>THEN I now hate you<BR>---<P>Is my assumption here correct?<P>Absor said that factions are not attached to corpses and I see this as the only flaw with this change. It just doesn't make sense to me that an NPC would start to hate someone that they didn't previously hate for dragging the corpse of someone they don't hate.<P>The example I can think of that might be a problem would be two partners wandering around a town where they are not hated. One "trips" and falls for enough damage to kill them, and they are bound far away. Also in the area is a kind cleric willing to ressurect the fallen hero, but he is not well liked in the town. There would be no way for the survivor to move his dead friend to a safer area for the cleric.<P>Granted, this is a pretty contrived example. I think this flaw is greatly outweighed by the potential exploit that could occur otherwise.<P>--- Geffin Dagrifter<BR>    Wealth Redistribution Engineer<BR>    Level 44, E'ci<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

But this works differently than people are used to, and we don’t want there to be too much confusion over this. You're right in your assumption.

</FONT><HR>Personaly I must say that I am opposed to this change, but besides that.  I think there should definatly be some more codeing done that whats been explained so far, if corpse dragging will agro someone.  If both people are not KOS to a mob than if his corpse is dragged by the mob the person dragging should not have to be afraid.. So therefore in the situation you intending, the corpse MUST have it's own FAC in order to provide a good basis.  Invis is still invis and should never be tainted.  Mobs that can see invis should see invis otherwise you should not have to worry about a CORPSE making you less invisible.  I do agree that if you die by attacking a mob that the mob should attack anyone helping him afterwards.  BUT if the person who died still has a decient fac with the mob then neiter person should have to worry.. like the newbie who accidently attack a guard shouldn't have to be afraid of the guard for the rest of thier lives.  There is ALOT to think about before quick coding this.  Please understand that some people drag corpses simply to help others who do not know the zone as well.  and the guards that like both parties should not attack someone for doing so.  I am very much against this change to begin with but if I were to accept it, I feel there should be much more thought involved.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have to agree here:<BR>1. The idea - mobs attacking people who drag the corpses of their enemies to safety - pretty good.<BR>2. The alleged hack implementation - they attack anyone moving corpses they don't own because looking up the factions of the deceased would be 'too hard' - very bad.<P>This is a new product. Figure out how to do it right.<P>...<P>Actually, you'ld think the mobs would drag the corpses of their dead enemies off anyway. Like to a waste pit, or the 'barbecue room' ... shouldn't all CR in old seb be from the froglok chefs area? And they could drag the corpses of their dead friends somewhere nicer.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

So the powergamers will have to use some brains and cunning on their future CR's instead of having their uber-friends bail them out.  <P>If you're more worried about losing "stuff" and losing "exp" then don't buy Velious.  Frankly I can not WAIT to explore the new zones, this sounds a lot like the old MUD's I used to play where mobs would camp your corpse (no hate lists to "erase" either, they hated you and you worked around it) and you had a limited number of deaths before your character went poof.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The thing is that people don't understand this won't make the game any harder at all. How do you get your corpse out of Sebilis now? Do you log in as your non_KOS gnome who can walk around freely with the frogs? NOPE! You have to find a way to get it out without getting killed many more times. That is all this does, keep you from keeping a non-KOS guy to do your CR, or even to drag your corpse to a safe spot so that you can skip everything and go straight to the disco room (to use a Sebilis example).<P>Please, people get off your high hoarses.

</FONT><HR>Alright - I only read the Absor replies on this issue from Caster's realm, but here's my take on this.<P>This is a bad, bad, time consumeing thing.  After all, if only the same person who died can drag their own body safely...how in the world will Melee people get a timely res?? So far, there is NO word on where melee people can bind.  If I am FORCED to walk back to my body, it is ENTIRELY possible that I can take the full three hours to get back to it - no res for me because of my class??  After all, people who can bind themselves can bind in the same zone, or the next one over.  I can't do that.  <P>Not even considering PVP implications here are you?? When you get Pked, someone else probably will be dragging you so you can get a revive - assumeing you're a melee class and you're bound far away.  So they take EXP loss death chances to move your butt when you did nothing other than get killed by ANOTHER PLAYER.  <P>Bad Idea Verant, Bad Idea.  <P>There has to be another way to address the issues that you want to address, without blatantly screwing people who have a harder time walking to their bodies in the first place - melee classes. <P>If people want to drag, let them drag.  If you want to make something harder, make it HARDER.  High level corpse recoveries are already tricky enough without this added - all this does is make it more time consumeing, which really isn't fair to melee binders, or anybody who can't devote 5 hours to just pulling a corpse.  <P>Don't penalize me further for picking a melee class and then devoteing 70odd days of my time into it.  'Just pick another class' doesn't cut it here either, don't even mention it, because we both know thats not fair to do to someone this far after release.  <P>I picked meleer because bard intrigued me and I now love it as my favorite class.  I accepted melee binding walks when I started it, fine, but don't MAKE me have to drag all of my own bodies after walking to them first.  <P>You guys keep on about how you want this to be a group game where people help eachother...and this is completely against that goal because it makes people NOT willing help eachother.  <P>Unless of course you're a monk or a necro, you just feign anyway...but thats not what you're intending is it Verant?? <P>-Nadira Andante<BR>Rallos Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Fact:<BR>When a player deletes himself, all corpses associated to that person are also deleted.  This reference is done while the player is offline since you can't delete your character from inside the game proper.  That means that there is already a function in the game to keep track of/find all of a player's corpses, offline or not.<P>Question:<BR>If there is code to determine who a corpse belongs to already, how can it be too hard to reference the owner of the corpse's faction?<BR>--<P>I won't pretend to know how your player database is structured, but I would think that each server must have some kind of database which contains every character on it.  Regardless of the database structure, there has to be one or more Primary Keys to allow for character lookup.<P>Let's assume the Primary Key for a character record is the character's name (since they must be unique).  Each corpse has the character's name on it.  This means that you have enough information to lookup a character record and then extract the faction information from there.  From a programming standpoint, any properly created database would be able to do this.<P>Let's say that the Primary Key for a character is not his name; let's pretend there is a unique ID attached to each character.  When a character dies, just add this ID to the corpse information.  This would allow a character to be referenced from its corpse, regardless of online status.<BR>--<P>I just don't understand how it could be 'too hard' for faction to be learned from a corpse.  You don't need to put the faction on the corpse, you just need to get the character record for whom the corpse belongs to, and extract faction information.<P>There _has_ to be a valid reason why you can't, or won't, do this.  I'd just like to know what the reasons are.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, <P>I COMPLETELY agree with the corpse change rule with one caveat. I do believe that faction of whoever you are dragging should be checked prior to the MOBs aggroing the dragger. I understand how the mobs would take offence to someone rescuing their enemies, but I cant see why it would be a problem to rescue friends. Also, what about if someone summon's corpse or casts res ? Do these have the same aggro ? If a non KOS guy reses a non KOS dead guy, will the poor cleric be wasted ? Food for thought. <P>To all of you knee jerking over this, you might try offering constructive criticism instead of merely flaming and blowing your top. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This has got to be the worst idea ever.  The game is already so built up against the player as it is.  Why make it even harder?  Are you trying to make your customers angry? <P>The reason that Absor wouldn't mention is because you can duel death, have your corpse dragged to a safe spot past all the baddies and be rezzed in.  This was VERY common for getting a large number of people past difficult spots.  It just isn't used anymore with CoH.  You can summon your friends directly now so changing the way corpses are dragged to prevent this is absurd as it isn't even used anymore.  <P>On top of that your whole reason for implementing it was because people killing the enemy shouldn't be able to have a non agro friend drag it out (which I am inclined to agree with) EXCEPT you cant drag out ANY corpse cept your own which just means VIs statement is just pure BS.  All this change is, is a NERF to prevent people from moving into harder places that they are not aligned to (which WAS widely used but is so ineffeicient now compared to a single mage CoHing everyone in that this NERF is far too late to fix this issue and only makes the game that much harder for your already underpowered customers). <P>SoV is 35+.  This means VERY few if any classes are able to solo low blues to begin with.  Now not only will they be getting their bu!ts kicked by low blues high greens and even low greens, but they wont even be able to have there friends CR their corpse (a HUGE consideration for a new expansion with no cities, MEANING:  Binding on Velious for the melee classes is going to be EXTREMELY limited)<P>Last and final note:  In a group limited to six members Rogues sure are looking nice for teh 4th slot right about now.  Insane damage output, decent tanking skills, can evade (sorta), and is a CR, trap sensing, disarming god.  As it stand now the most effeicient group in the game is going to be Cleric, Ench, War, and now Rogue.  Don't get me wrong I think Rogues SHOULD be needed in every group considering they are by far the ONLY class that is required to group from mid teens-60.  But that only leaves two slots in a group for the 10 other classes in the game.    <P>On a side note:  I am VERY curious how rez will affect/bother/do nothing to the Mobs around.<P>This is just another Verant 'fix' that is way too late, and has nearly NO time spent in common sense thinking of how this will affect the players (I really hope I don't have to remind you that's who this game is for).  And not only does it have poor thought on general outcome it has VERY poor implementation. ie... A non Kos person draggin out another Non KOS person is just as bad as a non KoS draggin out a KoS.  Is it that hard to make a PLAYER FRIENDLY GAME?  Everything VI has been doing lately has just made the game all that much harder for the average player.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>I think there are some valid questions here not answered.  Please take the time to answer some of them, as this IS a signifigant change to the way things are currently done.  And in the eyes of nearly every poster, myself included, a very anti-player one in the way it's presented.  Most people are asking because they care about the game, but mainly becuase it's a fun game to play.  Some of the responses make it sound very very not fun.<P>1.  If two AMIABLE people zone in to VeliousZoneA and one dies by non-Velious inhabitant attack (let's just say he falls off a building or something), can the other AMIABLE player drag the corpse out without getting attacked?  Mind you the death WAS NOT caused by Velious inhabitants, but, for sake of a better word, geography.<P>1a.  Same question but substitute the other AMIABLE player to be now an AMIABLE Necro or Cleric.  Can they safely Summon Corpse or Rez?<P>2.  Two AMIABLE players enter the new Dwarf town.  Player A does the newbie trick we all know so well and types H-A-I-L, and activates autoattack.  RandomDwarfGuy wipes the floor with him, while his friend stands there.  If Player A returns for his corpse, he will still be AMIABLE it the NPC.  99% of people playing have attacked their guildmaster at one time or another.  The GM did not kill you when you came back (although I always thought he should laugh at you, heh).  Can Player A recover his corpse safely?<P>2b.  As above, but can Player B, who stood next to his friend as he was made into worm food (and who is AMIABLE mind you), drag the body to another location safely?<P>2c.  As above, but AMIABLE Necro or Cleric.  Can they safely Summon Corpse/Rez?<P>3.  The biggie.  We ALL really want to hear these two.  Player A dies in X zone.  Let's just say he's hated intently by whatever killed him.  Necro zones in, and Summon's his corpse. Does the zone go bonkers on the Necro?<P>3a.  Same question, but with a Cleric.  Player drags (somehow) body to Cleric.  When Cleric performs the Rez, does the zone turn him into lunchmeat?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Fact is that ressing, CotH, and summon corpse, will NOT aggro as per what Absor has said.<P>Further if you had read all the posts on the subject, you would have seen a few very thought out posts by me, and I already brought up the exploit with CotH. Also, you _can_ do an exploit in which you cast both res and summon corpse, but I'll let you figure it out (like it's real hard).<P>Why don't people understand that it won't make a 'town' dungeon any harder than a dungeon like Old Sebilis?

</FONT><HR>1) You do not get summoned unless you do damage.<BR>2) You shouldn't have a problem summoning a corpse to a zoneline and then zoning.<BR>3) Shadow Knights, Necros and Monks can FD which has a very good chance of removing aggro.<BR>4) Rogues most likely will be able to pull corpses from some areas without problems.<BR>5) Make a mule to drag corpses beyond the aggro range of the mob. If they die, who cares.<P>The point of this expansion is that you play one area and rely on people who are your allies to do this. Although you may not like this concept, and in time the concept may show that it doesn't work well with Everquest, it's the way they designed this part of the game.<P>Personally, I think this may cause more problems then fun - but I am willing to see how things go before declaring that it's totally disgusting. The biggest thing I see happening that could cause problems is that one side has far beter loot and most people go to that side, leaving those who select the poorer side without a lot of options, especially when they die.

The consensus seems to be that the only realistic place for this code to be present is in Uber areas. Yet, in these uber areas not everyone will be KOS unlike past uber areas, now this would make the uber area not at all challenging if your group/guild had someone not KOS to the uber area sitting there to pull corpses.<P>   I predict getting corpses will be no more difficult then it already was, as long as invis/sneak isn't broken by corpse dragging.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It's an overdue enhancement of the game to anyone that's ever suffered through hours of a dungeon dive, only to get beaten to the mob by a group of pansy-@ss lamers that took some kind of a shortcut.<P>As for the issues surrounding faction hits.......if I understood Absor correctly, and I'm dragging a corpse around mobs that con amiable to me, then they are either going to go X levels more agro towards me or just automatically go to glaring threatenling.   I'm a monk, big friggin' deal.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You people are nuts.  All this does is make it so Velious zones are THE SAME AS ANY OTHER ZONE IN NORRATH!!!  You can't "cheat" by having good faction.  Where else can you drag corpses around at will?  That's right.  Nowhere, cause everything's agro.  Well now they just made that still be the case regardless of faction.  Bravo!!!  I'm all for it.  This just forces rogues to use hide/sneak just like they would anywhere else!  What is everyone getting worked up about???<P>Kordaal - Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>READ THE [explative removed] POSTS BY ABSOR PEOPLE!!!! Here are the answers to all your questions, all of which *I* can answer based soley on Absor's posting. <P>Tacos<BR>Station Member   posted 12-05-2000 01:49 PM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>just curious, someone had it in another post, I doubt, but still gotta double check <BR>Will a necro summoning corpses get himself agro'd?<P><BR>This will not aggro you. It is quite different than dragging a corpse, since you are not targeting corpses. Even if it did agro, as long as you weren't in the aggro range of a creature you wouldn't get aggroed (duh).<P><BR>xwhite<BR>Station Member   posted 12-05-2000 01:49 PM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Checking the faction of the corpse before deciding whether NPC's will aggro would create more problems than it would solve.<BR>All technical issues aside, imagine this situation:<BR>a_d00d shouts: 'Paying 100pp for a corpse drag'<BR>a_poor_player tells a_d00d: 'I'll do it if you aren't KOS'<BR>a_d00d tells a_poor_player: 'I'm amiable here, I swear'<BR>a_poor_player tells a_d00d: 'Ok, I'll drag it to the gate for you'<BR>a_d00d consents a_poor_player to drag his corpse<BR>Dragging a_d00d's corpse...<BR>Dragging a_d00d's corpse...<BR>an_uber_mob_00 hits a_poor_player for 350!<BR>...<BR>a_poor_player has been slain by an_uber_mob!<P> <P>When was the last time you saw a dwarf asking for help getting his corpse in Kaladim. Same concept. This dragging thing will only be in CITY ZONES!!!<P>WAR-DUDE<BR>Station Member   posted 12-05-2000 02:22 PM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Personally I think they should nix this idea and fix the #$%# fact u have to do the bag switch aroo in the banks. <BR>Sheez that is annoying more so than some one draggin a buddys corpse away. Ie Leave none behind. <P>Because they do one thing does not mean they cannot do another. In fact, these are  two seperate groups working on two things. The SoV staff would not be in charge of this change to the game.<P><BR>Casai<BR>Station Member   posted 12-05-2000 02:42 PM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>can we please do not make CR any more difficult when it allready is? Maybe you should consider that some of us like things lil bit easier rather then harder? just for a second. <P>It is not harder than it already is.<P><BR>Gadflye<BR>Station Member   posted 12-05-2000 05:20 PM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Well, that's one way to start removing high level gear from the economy. Unrecoverable corpses. These guys really don't have a clue about playability, except for skinner pellet feeders. ;P <P><BR>Corpses will be just as "unrecoverable" as they are currently in Sebilis.<P><BR>trashen<BR>Station Member   posted 12-05-2000 05:36 PM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Yup..even if you con warmly and are dragging your own corpse!  you become agro'd! sweeeeeet!!! <P>You will not be aggroed.<P>Milena_PAI<BR>Station Member   posted 12-05-2000 06:43 PM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>The only thing this thread has done is convince me that reading comprehension levels are at an all-time low. <P>Agreed.
