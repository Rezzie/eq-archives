</FONT><HR>I respect and admire the bard class, and I truly enjoy every rare time that I get the opportunity to group with one.<P>I have had the opportunity to play a bard.  Currently level 11, but hey, it's better than nothing  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">  I typically avoid the mobs that can bash but at higher levels that gets harder and harder.<BR>Playing a bard requires a lot of concentration.  In order to twist three songs, you have to pay close attention to your spell wearing off messages and be quick on the keys.<P>That being said, lets talk about these spells.<P>As an enchanter, I say: give the bards mez.  I can clarity, it stacks with manasong.  I can give long lasting speed buffs, I can even buff ac when our only buffer is a druid.  I'm not hurting for a group.  Mez is one of our class defining abilities, but, bards are a little bit of us, and we are a little bit of them (they had manasong before we had clarity after all).<P>Mezzing without mana is too powerful?<BR>I can lock down 2 mobs with enthrall (65 second mez) and med up during the time that they're sitting there yawning.  I gain slight mana considering no resists (I have 190 cha.. I get very few resists vs blues.. hardly ever go up against yellows or reds)  If I have only one mob mez'd, I gain back mana at a reasonable rate.  Three mobs?  I am slowly losing mana.<P>Considering that the AOE song can't be used against mobs above 30, I don't consider it unbalancing.  The targeted 'upgrades' I doubt could be sung on three mobs at once by a single bard, so compared to enchanters (Remember, I just said that I can effectively do 'manaless' mezzing on 2 mobs at once) that still works.<P>If making these songs work overpowers bards, then enchanters are already overpowered.<P>Give the bards back their mez.  Give groups more options.  Let me see more of this wonderful and versitle class in the world.<P>In bards I see a lot of promise... I also saw a lot of promise in rogues, and this has now been achieved.  Do the same for bards.  Fix their problems.  Give them back what they once had.  Give them a reason to mem this song once again.<P>=- Remelio Gemweaver - Lvl 48 High Elf Enchanter - Tarew Marr -=</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I will strive to make certain that things like this are<BR>&gt;                         communicated in a much more timely manner.<P>That pretty much says it all, 40%ish resists on any mob 1-30 is as intended.<P>verant please do us a favor and never get involved in the manufacture or quality assurance of any of the following products:<P>Cars<BR>Seatbelts<BR>Airbags<BR>Airplanes<BR>Parachutes<BR>Dog leashes<BR>Garage doors<BR>Buildings or Houses<BR>the list could go on but you see my point..<P>40% is way too high for a spell of this type at any level.  Why not a lower resist with a hard coded cap on 31+ mobs or 30+ wherever you want it to be exactly.<P>You see we agree that we shouldn't be as effective as Enchanters with these songs, but currently it has 0, none, nada, zip, zero, absolutely NO USE except to try and suicide ourselves as fast as possible.<P>/rude a_Moss_Snake04<BR>/say I will get you someday!<P>Anyone ever think that this sing was designed by a team of moss snakes and large rats?

</FONT><HR>i have read all the posts Aeolas (even the ones more long winded than I), and under neath all the number crunching and complaints, it comes down to one sentence "me/my group can't go to a zone where we are attacked by 5+ mobs, and put all but one of them under our mez and pic them off one at a time" if i'm miss reading these i apologise.  Yet, i digress, i am just trying to state that VI is trying to build a co-op for the players, to make the less socal of us work together, or to inovate ways of getting the job done.  No class/race should be solely dependant on its self in a dynamic world, and VI is doing it's best through all the complaints, and VERY few complements &lt;that i've been able to find&gt;, and that is simply because most people like I who are enjoying their experince, and learning to deal/cope with the fantasy world that has been created for us, are usually having to much fun to have time to post. if lulliby &lt;hey i warned ya about my spelling&gt; isn't working to make you happy any more find another song/way of handling the lack that has been placed apon it.<P>As far and those that say well you've never played a bard you wouldn't know, hey i'm working on 3 charaters and haven't even got to work on my rogue, but i'm trying to work on getting my bard started.

</FONT><HR>I think the saddest thing about all of this is Verant's inablity to understand they are doing more harm then good by giving bards songs that rarely work, because if they worked bards would be over powered without a dependence on mana. I've said it before, and I'll say it again, "if you intended for bards to do something let them do it." No more of this you kinda can do it stuff. The inability to do something you've been told you could leads to feelings of hurt and distrust. (Even if Verant had said the spell had limitations.) No body reads the small print. (And as you've said there was no small print until now.)It's like a bait and switch and that leads to a high lvl of distrust.  <BR>Lulluby is only the most recent example of this. With the continued watering down of our songs and the continued lack of understanding of a bards role of a bard besides a mana generator you only has give rise to customer displeasure and the lose of some of the most dedicated high lvl  bards out there.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

But for the time being, I've never ONCE seen a bard turned down for a group, in fact everyone's usually -very- happy to have one, and that's -not- just for the mana song.  <P>You can solo things no other class can dream of.

</FONT><HR>Unlike other hybrids Bards make up for their experiance penalty.  I should point out however that the bard could never solo 3 HGs without using mana, which he cannot get back (mana song does nothing for him, and meditate is at 1).  It is also extremely risky and can lead to death for the bard.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I felt the need to chime in my $0.02, as I just recently started a bard (23rd level) and I'm confused by the firestorm in here. I've been fighting in lake of ill omen against the sarnaks, which range from white to red to me. Every so often I'll nab 2 or 3 when pulling, or we'll get a mob jumping us mid-fight. We'll all pick one to beat on and I'll just burn lullaby as much as I can (Occaisionally having to twist in some stamina, or throw a debuff at the one we are fighting) Sure the mobs dont mez EVERY round the song happens, and sure they break mez sometimes. But they mez more often than not, and every round they are sitting there staring blankly is a round I've not had to take damage. So in my feeble mind, lullaby is a handy utility spell. Sure it isnt like having a chanter around to just mez everything that comes our way, but if you wanted to be an enchanter, be an enchanter!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I do agree with people somewhat, bards are overall weak enough that taking the massive xp hit (Not quite as bad as a SK, but not like say...a warrior =) really sucks. <P>But other than that, I really enjoy my bard. Hell, one of my best friends in the game is a high level bard. I had the pleasure of playing his bard on a nagafen raid recently, and I have to say bards can be pretty effective, their MR and FR resist songs are huge! I think more people would play SKs, bards and wizards if people whined about them less on here mebbe. (Tho my primary is a wizard, and not a day goes by I wish I had some groupfriendly ability  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> )<P>Anyway, cheer up, wear more hats and um...try having fun, it IS a game ya know. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I don't think we're a weak class, I just think our role has been skewed, and the balance of the game is out of kilter because of this issue (Enchanter monopoly on a skill when no other single class has a monopoly on an important skill).<P>Bard's are supposed to be part-enchanter, and are supposed to be the backup crowd controllers.  This may come as news to the newer players, but the Necro CC spell was not in the game at release.  It was added as an enhancement to the class as a fear spell after release, and then later changed to a mez spell.  I should know, my first char was a Necro and I didn't get that spell until after I was already quite a few levels above that point.<P>My point is, Bards are SUPPOSED to be backup Enchanters, but in its current state the only class that can mez besides them are Necros.  This goes against the original design, and it doesn't make any sense.  Doesn't it make more sense to you that a Bard playing a song can put monsters to sleep then, say, breathe underwater, levitate, or be invisible?  It was the one song that made total sense and fit right in as the classic image of a Bard!<P>The reason Bards are mad is because we've been told that the song was supposed to work a certain way, waited a year for it to be fixed to work that way, then told "nevermind, we like it not working."  Wouldn't that make anyone mad?  Many of us kept playing our Bards only because Verant was promising to fix this eventually, and now that they've changed their minds we feel we have nothing left but to be mana batteries =(.<P>- Zanen</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

The problem is that multitudes of folks say that UNDER LEVEL 30 mobs are getting 70% resist rates.  Verant says they tested the resist rates and work as intended.

No bard increase of mana that other hybrids got. But bards dont need alot of mana.<P>Bards need mana for what, one or two songs?

Bards cant regenerate mana in anyway except thru time, bards are the only class like this.<P>Again, it's one or two songs.  I find it really odd that you're making such a big deal about this, when it's so easy to turn it around and point out to you that YOU ARE THE ONLY CASTING CLASS IN THE GAME THAT NEVER ACTUALLY -NEEDS- TO MEDITATE!  This is by FAR your strongest advantage, and reduces your downtime to virtually nil compared to anyone else.  You can even fight while casting and never lose a swing!  In that light, I'm sorry, but your arguments 3 and 4 actually point out your strengths, not your weaknesses, to me.<P>5. Enchanters were given clarity, bard mana song used to be the only way to do this.<P>Hmm, didn't know that.  Oh well.  You have track, and until they fix it, it's better than rangers at high levels.  Really want to stick on this point?  <P>6. Necros are given mez. So bards lose this abilty and necros gain it? <P>Just checking, theirs works on undead only, right?  And it's single mob, not AE, correct?  I believe you do have a working single mob mez, don't you?  None of this is meant to sound condescending, that's just my understanding of the situation and I just want the details before I comment.<P>7. Other hybrids gain an increase in defense capabilities, bards overlooked.<P>HAHAHAHAAH.  You are SO wrong.  Bards are now defensively FAR SUPERIOR to rangers.  Rangers are the only hybrid that got no defensive increase, bards got LARGE increases to defensive skills.<P>8. Selos nerfed. Twice!<P>I never heard that selos was nerfed.  Can you offer details?  I don't want to discount any of your points without all the facts.<P><BR>I wish a lot of my arguments hadn't had to revolve around rangers, but given that you keep mentioning hybrid comparisons, I have to offer them as the comparison, as that's what I know.<P>By the way, while I believe that rangers did get pretty screwed in defense post 50, I don't go nuts and flame Verant for it.  You guys have given new meaning to Verant bashing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

With each nerf I become less versatile and less useful to groups.<P>Qwinn, play a bard up to level 50, then come back here and tell us how satisfied we should be.

</FONT><HR>Qwynn <P>Posts such as yours which state the effectiveness of a character in a certain level range are very misleading. Its the same thing with the hybrids vs melee debate. All the melee classes yell 'but you guys were way more powerful up to level 50! Its our turn now!'<P>You will spend more of your time playing EQ levelling from 50 - 60 than you did from 1 - 50.<BR>Saying that a character class WAS powerful in a certain level range (ie being able to solo hill giants for a brief amount of time) is pure garbage.<P>This goes to the melee classes as well when they yap about hybrids having it easy for a period of time.<BR>Hybrids are now supposed to be left out of trackanon, Venril and planes raids because they could solo a freaking croccodile for an entire 2 week span months ago!<BR>Each class should have something to bring to the table at all level ranges and not be preferred <BR>more than any other class at any level.<BR>THAT is balance. Verant has not achieved this.<P><BR>Cmon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>This was most assuredly using our first charm song, limited to level 37 mobs or under.  Hill giants happen to cap out at EXACTLY 37.<P>The song SHOULD require something like 5 mana really, but it doesn't.  The song is overpowered and its obvious as heck.  But Verant doesn't test bards.<P>And if it gets changed to 5 mana, you cant honestly tell me it wasnt needed.  To level 41 bards are soloing machines, excluding the experience penalty of 50% and another 50% penalty for having your pet getting the exp for the kill.  Meaning that of that if a mob gave 1/10000 of the exp to level, for killing it normally with a human wizard.  That same mob using charm kiting would give 1000th of the level*1.5*2=3000, meaning 1 THIRD of the exp total.<P>A wizard soloing that 1 HG would get the same realtive experience as a bard would charm kiting them with our 1 overpowered song.<P>The 39th song is a perfect example of what the lvl 27 song SHOULD be, minus the MR debuff.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Actually Quinn a bard at low 40s cant solo 2 HGs. The charm song doesnt work past level 37. And we dont get another charm song till high 40s. 47 I think it is. I am not that high yet, so I cant quote the exact level we get the new song. Yes bards do get to solo 2 HGs when they get higher. I wont argue that, what I will argue is that since release bards have had their abilities nerfed and given to other classes more than any other class in this game. Its getting old really really quick. At least they tried to throw rangers a bone with Jolt, and double damage bow shots. Not nearly enough if you ask me. Rangers should get an evade skill like rogues, its only fair. But verant hasnt tried to do one thing to improve bards. Just take away our abilities.<P>I think the bards have a right to be angry<P>Nayami</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>On the Druzzil Ro server there is a bard that can solo 2 ice giants in everfrost kiting them around.  From what I can see he stays ahead of them (snaring or selos I do not know) and using an area effect damage song (anytime I got close got that message saying so-n-so tries to cast on you but you are protected)  anyway, next time I see him I can take screen shots if that is what is truely wanted.   But just to say 1 person can make a bard do that does not mean everyone who plays a bard can.  That 1 person is very talented.  He knows how to play the bard that way.  Technicly (sp) anyone should be able to if 1 person can, but that is not always practicle.  It might take him  20 minutes to kill his 2, I don't now, never stuck around to watch a full fight.   First time I saw him I thought he was running for his life and needed help, til I saw first 1, then moments later the 2nd drop dead.   Anyway, I got off subject.   point is a bard can solo multiple mobs kiting, but it is a rare sight.   I have seen other classes soloing, ever see a cleric solo a seafury?  Rare to be sure, but it can be done.  Saw it happen when I was hunting them in a group.  Ever see a warrior kite a HG?   Done that, just to see if I could with a sow potion and 300 some arrows.   Got several archery improvements, had to melee near the end, ran out of arrows, nearly died, but was fun.   I guess the point is, just because 1 or 2 can, doesn;t mean everyone can.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I have to say, I usually agree with the "nerfs" and changes made to the game.  Although I don't always like them, I can see why VI would feel they are necessary for balance.  I do, however, have express dis-satisfaction with the decisions made on the bard issue.  Why? Bards are a dying class.  They make up a very small percentage of the population, and new bards I see are usually twinks who get played until about level 15 then disbanded.  It's sad.  I always enjoy grouping with a bard, and my husband, who has a level 22 bard, loves to play him.  However, his level 22 bard does little these days except shop in the bazaar and run characters from A to Z.  <P>While classes like Rangers and Wizards who threaten to "quit the game in droves" would have very little impact on the game overall (because even if 10% of them did quit, there would be plenty of others out there to maintain class balance), the same is not true of bards.  If 10% of the bards quit, the impact would be noticed. There just aren't enough of them as is.  <P>I do hope the Bard situation is re-visited.  If Lullaby is over-powered, why not revise it and improve it?  Bards complain of little except that some of their songs need attention.  It is my hope this vital character class sees some positive changes in the near future.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 10 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011801-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011801.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011801-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011801-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011801-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011801-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011801-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011801-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011801-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011801-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=011801&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=011801&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
