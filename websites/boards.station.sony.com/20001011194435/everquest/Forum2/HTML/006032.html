What I find aggrivating is that your programers are now working on things like text colors and other low priority things, while this bug has been around for close to a year. It was thought, that this bug was delayed because you thought it was low priority, but now I don't even know if thats accurate...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Brad promised me it would get fixed after Kunark was released. Then later he said "we're working on it" and now months later its still not fixed! <P>Darkmatter,<P>What Brad promised is that he understood what the claim was and that we'd look into it.  At no point have we agreed that there is a problem.  The screenshots that were posted only show that the when the rain turns off, the fog moves out past the max clipping plane for an instant, then back in.  This isn't indicative of there being any problem with the way that the plane works.  Many zones have clips that are determined by the area.  For instance, Toxxulia Forrest has a max clipping plane that is pretty close because we wanted the zone to appear eerie.  <P>We're still looking into the issue, but it's not the highest of priorities at this time.  The most likely "fix" will be for us to make it so that the plane doesn't extend beyond max when the rain turns off.  The net result of this fix is basically nothing, which is why it's not a high priority at the moment.  We have already confirmed that the min/max clipping plane boundaries are indeed set to the appropriate limits.<P>-Gordon<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>At the risk of being rude (which isn't my intention) I must tell you that you have NO idea what your talking about on this issue. Brad most certainly DID promise to get this fixed. He did so before Kunark was released, during one of my posts. Not the one where I posted screenshots. I would show you the post, but you deleted them all. And the clipping plane is MOST CERTIANLY BROKEN, you can deny it untill your blue in the face but it will STILL be broken. I know this for a fact for 2 very good reasions. <P>1. When zoning into Felwith, you used to be able to see the town from the tunnel, now you can't.<P>2. When zoning into Freeport from Nro, you used to be able to see town, now you can't. <P>There are many other areas where this is the case, Oasis being one. Many people have posted of areas where they could see farther before, but you have continued to ignore them. I have smiled, and took you at your word for a very long time on this issue, but I am getting sick of you glazing over this. You can't even admit theres a problem half the time.<BR>You get an A+ for end run arounds Abashi. I just wish at the end of this end run was an actuall fix...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Would the fact that I sometimes can't see NPCs or PCs until I'm on top of them have something to do with this issue?<P>My plane is maxed, yet invariably (in NRo especially) I'll be bopping along towards a spawn or something, I'll stop from a distance to see how crowded it is, and much to my glee, will see nobody around. Once I get there however, upwards of 5 to 10 players will suddenly appear in front of the spawn, and appear to be attacking an unseen mob. Only moving in closer will cause the mobs to appear, even though they're getting the pants beat off of them.<P>Is this related?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>From what I can gather, Darkmatter, the clipping plane is not BROKEN.  What seems to have happened is that they dropped the maximum viewing distance by a great deal.  If the clipping plane was BROKEN it would not be working as intended.  I'm pretty sure Verant intended for it to be as shallow as it is.<P>So the problem is, Verant, WHY IS THE CLIPPING PLANE SO CLOSE?  Is there any reason why I can't stand atop the Aviak village and see Splitpaw in the distance?  If my computer can handle it, then why is the clipping plane so close?<P>If this isn't what you're referring to, Darkmatter, then please explain exactly how the clipping plane is "broken".  Keep in mind, I'm a programmer, and to me, "broken" means "Not working as intended by the programmers."  It does not mean, "Not the way the users want it."<P>- Teramenor</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Addendum: Gordon, I saw your comment about wanting Toxxulia to be eerie.  Okay, fine, I can dig that.  But what about the huge open plains of the Karanas?  I can't imagine you'd want those to be anything but expansive.<P>If it's because peoples' hardware can't handle it, well, then, why not let people decide that?  It might not work to have to change your clipping slider every time you zone, I'll grant that.  So why not have it save the slider settings on a per-zone basis?  That can be done client-side.<P>- Teramenor</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Not defending anyone, especially VI, but I do remember a post a long time ago that they deliberately reduced visual ranges after the clipping plane was started.<P>If they had left it reduced and increased it by zone until they had the results they wanted, there would be a lot less complaints.<P>I agree that it has been reduced A LOT. In Everfrost, where I was hunting icey orcs when the CP was introduced, I could see bandl from the top of the mountain in the south east corner as well at the entrance to perma.

</FONT><HR>I think the problem, that Abashi claims doesn't exist, is this:<P>Any increase in the clipping plane setting beyond the 13th 'notch' yields NO change in the viewable area, in any zone.  7 notches do absolutely nothing.<P>I'd hazard a guess that because there are people who swear that it does change, and those who swear that it does not, it is a hardware or driver related problem.<P>Both of my computers exhibit this non-existant problem.  In both cases the viewable area extends beyond 'normal'when it stops raining, and then returns to 'normal' shortly thereafter.<P>That said, people should probably post the specifics of their setup on the quality assurance board, for Ester and Hobart to take a look.  Post it again on this board, for Rowyl to take a look.<P>Ahh well.  Maybe someone at Verant will take the time to investigate reported problems before declaring them 'fixed'.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

From there you used to be able to see the Arcane Science building CLEARLY. You could even see it from East Commons if you got up on the side of the zone near the Nektulos Forest entrance!<P>Seeing the Boat and and part of the town from zoning into N Ro is possible if you zone in near the docks. Try the EC -&gt; W Freeport view. If you can't see the Arcane Sciences building then it is broken.<P>For Abashi: We are not making this up. I want you to go to EC - W Feeport zone line. Zone into W Freeport. Set Clipping Plane all the way out. Take a screenshot. If you CAN see the Arcane Science building then something is wrong with either certain video cards or display drivers. If not, then the Clipping Plane is broken for everyone.<P>And yes, I am absolutely freaking ultra positive that I used to be able to see the Arcane Science building.

It was beautiful.<P> I have my clip plane pushed all the way out all the time, because I love being able to see the really great scenery... or at least I used to.  S Ro used to be very beautiful.. could see all the way across it.  It's just not possible anymore.. Much of the beauty of the zones have been taken away with the changing of the clip plane, and I REALLY wish they'd put it back.

</FONT><HR>I think you hit the nail on the head Darkmatter&gt;&gt; "I wonder if perhaps you intentionally nerfed the clipping plane."<P>This is the only explanation I can come up with now. Here's my take on what went down:<P>They decide to improve the clipping plane so we can see all the beautiful scenery. Brad makes a big announcement in the patch to this effect. We all gawk at the added graphics and post accordingly to the message board. (Yes, Abashi some of us have been around long enough to remember this.)<P>Time goes by and someone at Verant realizes that improving clipping plane could result in fewer deaths. Ex.: Someone fighting in North Karanas gets a griffon trained on them. With the new clipping plane they can see both the wooden and stone bridge and they make a run for the closest one.<P>The number one rule at Verant doth state: "Thou shall not avoid death!" Well, the clipping plane might save a few lives so they don't like it. But there is a little problem, Brad made a big deal about the clipping plane improvement and to nerf is now makes Brad, et al look kinda stupid. So, instead of just nerfing it one day they add the fog effects and stealth nerf it in that patch. <P>Now the denials start. "Huh, there is something wrong with the clipping plane?", etc. But, they have a reasonable excuse because it seems like it was a "bug" introduced by the fog effects. They pray that people will forget about it and no bring it up again. Besides, they have time on their side. Each new player doesn't know about the nerf and many older players are leaving. If they just ignore and confuse the issue long enough there won't be any players left who remember what the clipping plane used to do.<P>Then comes Darkmatter. He won't let it die and keeps bringing it up. Brad sees a post and comments on it. Checks it out himself and notices that something wrong. We all know that Verant doesn't seem to be the best at inter-office communication so at this point somewhere someone on the Live Team must have gotten a hold of him and told him that it was nerfed and why and since that time he has been strangely quiet even though he has been posting on the board frequently.<P>So now they are changing their tune again. &gt;&gt;"At no point have we agreed that there is a problem. The screenshots that were posted only show that the when the rain turns off, the fog moves out past the max clipping plane for an instant, then back in. This isn't indicative of there being any problem with the way that the plane works." <P>This is an outright distortion of the truth. Brad specially stated that he agreed that there was a problem in a previous post on the old board.<P>In conclusion this is what we want: Either admit it is a nerf and say so in the patch or FIX IT NOW!! No more stone-walling, no more half truths, no more claims of ignorance. Personally I don't think it will ever be fixed because if it really is a nerf they don't want to admit it (what I believe) or they have dug themselves such a hug hole that to admit they are wrong now would be akin the whole "Alchemy is working" debacle.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

"The clipping plane was broken accidentally and we never got around to fixing it."<BR>4. "We changed it on purpose for the following reason: [good solid straight explanation]."<P>Ideally I'd like to get a #4 from you, Verant, but even #3 would be okay.  #2 would be disappointing and #1 would be appalling.

</FONT><HR><BR>Gordon:  What part of Brad going into the game and VERIFYING with his own two eyes that the plane no longer does anything past 70% are you thinking of when you say "we don't believe it's broken"?<P>Do you have any idea how frustrating it is to get your people to actually look into problems and fix them?<P>History lesson:<P>o  Clipping plane introduced.  Works great - players love it.  Plane works from 0% to 100% in all zones, and even during rain.<P>o  Verant stealth-nerfs rain-fog.  Clipping plane now crashes to 0% any time there's weather.<P>o  Players yell at Verant.  Verant denies that anything changed.<P>o  After three weeks, Verant agrees that "someone did enhance the rain, and it was always intended to be that way."<P>o  Players argue that 15 feet of visibility during rain is stupid.  Verant waves hands.<P>o  After a couple of months, Verant finally is dragged kicking and screaming into the reality that they did mess up the rain-fog code, and that the clip plane is only supposed to go down to 20% or so in most zones during rain instead of the 0% which was delivered.<P>o  Verant quietly fixes rain-fog to allow a very modest increase in visibility up to about 15% or 20% in most zones.<P>o  Players are somewhat happier with the change.<P>o  A few more months go by, and Verant re-introduces rain-fog 0% clip plane bug.  People complain, Verant ignores.<P>o  Kunark comes out.  Clip plane during clear weather is cut back to 60% of its original capacity in ALL zones, both old and new.  Assorted dungeons are cut back from 25% to 0%.  Rain fog is still at 0% and Verant ignores it despite having patched it the last time it was broken.<P>o  Players start telling Verant the clip plane is broken.  Verant denies it.<P>o  Players begin posting screen shots, showing no differences between 60% clip setting and 100% clip setting.  Verant produces two different and self-contradictory versions of how the clip slider works in an effort to explain away the problem.  Neither of the Verant explanations maps to reality.  Verant still refuses to believe anything is wrong with the clip plane despite having at least two active bugs going on (rain, and max clip, plus possibly dungeons).<P>o  More people post, and more screen shots begin to come out.  Verant says "maybe we can help you a little by pushing the min and max zone-specific clip values out a bit".<P>o  The 'fuss with the zone clip values' chance goes in.  No one anywhere is able to see father.  A handful of people report an actual drop in visibility in a few zones.<P>o  Verant swears on a stack of bibles that the graphics engine "is not capable" of showing anything further than what is being seen.<P>o  Some clever players note that the clip plane goes all the way out to 100% for a brief moment at the end of rainstorms.  They catch screen shots, and show them to Verant.  Verant blusters that this is not possible since the zone can't do that.  More screen shots come out.<P>o  Brad himself finally reacts to the presence of rather embarassing looking screen shots that show his game engine is currently nerfed at less than 70% of capacity.  He logs into a Kunark zone and looks around.  He reproduces the end-of-rain issue, and uses a non-standard UI to look at the behavior of the clip slider.  He agrees that the clip slider appears to have no affect past 70% despite his and gordons descriptions that it operates from 0 to 100% in all zones.  He looks at a little display in his UI which claims that the visibility is going out to about 1800 /loc units at 70%, and then goes no further.  He mumbles something about max distance supposed to be somewhere around 2000 to 2400 /loc units, but then quickly moves on to conclude that its no big deal, that everything is fine, that people can see exactly as far as they always did, especially in non Kunark zones (where he didn't even look), and that maybe the little sleder control needs re-scaling to make the 70% thing be 100%.<P>o  Players are left speechless as Gordon and other officials continue to claim that nothing is wrong. <P>o  Players begin to think Gordon is either a moron, or dishonest as he diligently ignores the real issues of:<P>1:  Being able to see as far as we could about 8 months ago - a distance of approx 2000 /loc units in all good-visibility zones.<P>2:  Being able to see further than 0% during rain - again since we used to be able to, we can't now, and Verant had actually specifically patched this problem before breaking it again.<P>3:  Being able to see further than 0% in most dungeons (repeat refrain: we used to be able to see to 20% in Perma, now it's 0%, we don't care what the little table of zone-clip numbers say we use our eyes to test it not an editor)<P>4:  Being able to use the full range of the clip slider in all zones as it used to work and as its correct functionality is described by Verant.<P>Instead of addressing these issues which players patiently and repeatedly bring up, Gordon comes out here and talks about the one little end-of-rain thing which we used to prove his claim of "it can't go out any farther" as a flat out lie.  He ignores all the other broken clip plane things, dismisses the end-of-rain thing with a huge handwave, and then attempts to spin it that there's nothing at all known wrong.<P>I'm past my threshold of belief.  This has gone into dishonesty.  I cannot believe that Verant actually does not know the real issues and cannot use 30 seconds to verify that their stupid zone tables are BROKEN.<P>Gordon:  Pick a nice outdoor zone.  Look in whatever those tables are and find out how far you are supposed to be able to see.  I understand its written in /loc units, and that it's supposed to be on the order of 2000 or more /loc units.  Now go to that zone.  Set you plane to 100%.  Look for the farthest land mark you can see.  Do a /loc, then jog to the landmark and do another /loc.  Subtract the two values to get the distance between.  You will have a value of 1300 /loc units or less according to our tests.  Now come back here and explain to us how 1300 is equal to 2000, and how the clip plane is working correctly.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006032-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006032-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006032-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006032-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=006032&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=006032&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
