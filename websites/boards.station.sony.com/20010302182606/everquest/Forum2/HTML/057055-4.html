</FONT><HR>You know, the more I hear from people, and the more I contemplate the bard class, the more convinced I become that the "eccentric" class of EverQuest needs an "eccentric" balance.<P>We've got a lot of songs that most classes would consider fairly useless, but we've managed to find ways to use them effectively, for the most part. We have managed to specialize in the short-term charm... (tell another class they can have a charm spell that lasts for 5-15 seconds and see if they're as excited as we are to get it). We dance around like maniacs trying to avoid death, while using area-effect damage songs in places where others insist they are fatal. Nearly every song has a use for some bard amongst our ranks...<P>Well, Mellifluous Motion is an exception, since I don't know anyone who has found enough use for it to bother to memorize it.<P>So... perhaps all we really need are a few more unique songs scattered through our list? Maybe even some that rely upon each other to work well. <P>A few ideas might be:<P>Stage Death Song - A Pixie Strike mesmerization effect, with a strong AC reduction component. The target would basically be forced into a "feign death" pose.<P>Dance of Madness - Area Effect hate-list wipe song... Remove the aggro list from everything within range, and force them to dance in a circle for a second or two. This song would essentially shuffle targets in a group combat, since obviously there would be plenty of targets within range after it was played.<P>Call of Atonal Resonance (i.e. the headache song) - High level damage over time on a single target, with an increase in "fizzled" spells... perhaps through intelligence reduction? <P>Ballad of the Bacchanal - A group "drunk" song, where each pulse is the same as a sip of drink. Silly and strange... but potentially useful, kind of.<P>Anthem of Leadership - A song which specifically cancels fear or charm effects on the group. Would by necessity need a huge radius. Would also be very appropriate for a bard.<P>Temporal Timbres - An extreme unstackable area effect and group haste song. A maxxed out haste which affects everything in an area, grouped or not. Basically, it would speed up a physical combat on both sides. Might be to good effect, might be a mistake, but isn't that how all the best bard songs are?<P>The Slippery Song - Increases the breakout chance for roots, snares, and entanglements.<P>-------------<BR>Okay... I could go on, but I just wanted to put this idea out there as an alternative solution, more in keeping with the "flavor" of the bard class, rather than simply bumping up defense or some other bland fix.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt; Fix the song ends/starts/ends bug. This is definitely not a “minor” bug, and I think that Absor just wasn’t aware of the frequency of this bug. It happens several times an evening for me, and mostly due to lag I would suspect. <P>YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES!!!  This one is VERY important.  It happens more than several times per night to me.<P>(more whining follows...) <P>Attributes required to play a bard:<BR>1) Introverted player who does not want to lead groups or talk to other players because they'd rather hit keys every 3 seconds for the duration of all combat and critical situations.<BR>2) Fast network connection to avoid lag, because lag cancels any skill you might develop as a player.<BR>3) A fast computer because of the extra processing power needed to display graphical effects generated by any skill you develop.<P>I think the idea of macroing songs would address at least two of the three issues above.<P>As for balance... well, I don't have a high level bard so it is hard for me to speak to it.  It does seem to me that a high level bard is a "jack of all trades".  So while a cleric is a better healer, a warrior a better tank, a mage a better nuker, and an enchanter a better traffic cop a bard should be able to contribute some effectiveness in any of these areas as the need arises.  Just because your group has an enchanter shouldn't reduce a bard's contribution to crowd control.  Just because you have a cleric shouldn't mean your healing is worthless.  Instead healing should be better.  Crowd control should be better.  Buffing should be better.  Everything should be a little better.<P>Basically, I think a bard should be able to help with whatever role is needed at that moment... A high level bard should be to a well rounded group what spices are to a finely prepared meal.  Alone they really don't provide any nourishment, but in combination they accentuate what is already there, making everything a little better.  Better crowd control when you're mobbed.  Better healing/mana during downtime.  Another tank when you need a target to distract a MOB.  Another puller when your monk is stuck.  Etc. Etc. Etc.<P>But most of all, fix the ends/starts/ends bug.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Bards and Auto Twisting<P>Absor please respond to this post, I'm sure many bards are curious on your feelings on the issue of auto twisting.<P>Option 1: Bards need scalable auto twisting...For example at level 20 you can auto-twist 2 songs,at level 53 you can auto twist 4 songs with a max of 5 songs possible. Having a max amount of songs higher than the auto twist number makes it still an option to twist songs manually. <BR>Option 2:You could also make it a new skill that you learn at 40+ (40+ bards already have enough experience in twisting songs, we dont need any more =).<P>Reasons why bards need auto twisting:<P>1)Its hard to communicate during ANY battle, your friends give you /tells, group info that you need to say, and all other talking is impossible to do while twisting. Everquest is supposed to be a social game, right?<P>2)Carpel Tunnel, I'm sure many heavy computer users are aware of this. Twisting songs for 3+ hours (especially during looong raids that take 7+ hours) is very tiring and and annoying. We already know how to twist songs, high level bards have been doing this monotonious task for hours and hours and we need a break. All EQ bards will thank Verant years from now by not having carpel tunnel.<P>3) Unfair advantages to users with fast connections/computers. When a song is cast/cancelled the song bubbles take a few frames to refresh. Users with high end computers have a fast refresh rate on the bubbles which leads to them singing another song in less time than a bard with a slow computer (to compensate for this i'm sometimes forced to stare at the ground/wall to increase graphics performance). Bards with high latency also have a similar problem (need to wait for a song pulse message to switch songs, high latency = slow message). EQ is supposed to be a game where computer performance is not an issue in determining the strength of your character.<P>I'm sure I missed a few things in the post, if anyone has anything to add, please do so.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Bards are just fine until post 50. I will even go as far as saying they are perhaps the most powerful class before lvl 50. However the damage scaling issue and the resists issue must be looked into. Pixie strike has been a joke eversince the double resist check was added. The post 50 offensive debuffs are double and triple resist checks.... I'm scared to see how much these will get resisted.<P>The recent change to snare root stacking has made the easy life of a druid even easier... while once again removing a tactic from a bards repertoire. &lt;breaking root by chaining yourself&gt; When 2 bards discovered they could essentially immobilize amob by stacking chains and largo's and fearing... they er corrected it. They increased the mana cost of charm by 800% &lt;we still can't regain mana by any artificial means.. not even modulating rods from a mage work&gt; and we all know how long that precious blue bar takes to refill..:P <P> Those are a few examples of er Bug Corrections. No other class has been er corrected more except maybe Necro's. I'm still steaming mad over failure of an emergency patch for when they broke Selo's/drum. Lets face the fact that we are not going to get enhancements to put us on a Par with the other post 50 classes. They would have to make all our songs with multiple resists a single resist check, thats not gonna happen.. see Pixie Strike &lt;used to work great b4 the double resist was added&gt; They are not gonna allow Selo's in Dungeons &lt;I miss barreling around Paw at top speed bumping off walls and getting lost  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> &gt; They will not upgrade melee skills &lt;now them tank types actually have a chance against me in PvP&gt;<BR>The only option they have is more songs... and maybe more disciplines...

</FONT><HR>  Here is my request, Take the double resistance check off pixie strike because it makes the song hardly worth playing, Personaly i think the AoE mez song (Kelins lucid lullaby) should have a way lower resist rate when you have a stringed inturment out, the reason i think this? well when ever i end up useing the song i normaly keep playing it over and over with out meleeing or twisting any song, so i think it should work alot more if all im doing is singing the same song over and over again, otherwise its just a waste of time that i could have spent meleeing and twisting to help out the group more<BR>  Something else i was wondering, i dont know if this is possable for ballance issues, but would it be possable to give bards a bit more hit points or mabey more ac, even at level 30 i do my fair share of tanking and even with skin like nature i still get pounded to bits by blues.<BR>  Another thing is the songs that Do have usefull effects but have a protective damage shield built in, basicly the olny things these songs will effect is someone who is not being hit, i think the olny damageshield song bards need is Shield of song.<BR>Well that is it for my first post, more to come if i find more problems with the class as i gain levels  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Thanks,<BR>Korox 17 cleric high officer of "alliance of the stars"<BR>Bsharp 30 bard<BR>Norcox 35 druid</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I was on here, and thought about my girlfriend who plays a bard and thought I should post on her behalf, as well as my own opinion.<P>I think one of the chief skills of the RL person playing the bard should be the ability to twist songs.  Of course its challenging!  she had to learn, as should everyone else.  She had to refine timing on songs, get a rythm... but it was all in the love of being a bard.  I agree with some of the previous posts... if it is too challenging for some people to twist songs- fine.  just play another class.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A response to Celtmans statement that Bards are just fine until post 50:<P> I have to disagree with you Celtman. Bards are no where near balanced to the other classes pre 50. Granted, Bards can solo better than most classes especially after they receive their charm songs. (Which are not good in groups because of the high resists and short duration except to get something off of someone) But soloing is not the issue, its grouping and groupability. Granted providing mana is at least useful once you hit 32, but if that is the only value a bard can bring to a group, then somone needs to evaluate the bards balance. I know that any other hybrid class can provide more healing (sk exception for self on heals), spell damage and melee damage not to mention tanking. Bards arent asking to be tanks, just more survivable than a person in a dress (caster). <P>I checked out the Ranger talks and I was surprised to read that most of their posts were geared towards making Rangers more equal to warriors. They wanted warrior hit points, higher ac and defense skills. I think Bards would be happy to have even a rangers tank ability. Bards dont want to be tanks, or even the masters of damage in a group, mere balance to the others would suffice.<P>I wont suggest what changes need to be in place post 50, and I would strongly urge post 50'ers to not suggest that Bards are balanced pre 50. If you still believe Bards sre balanced, I suggest leveling a bard to 20 non twinked and see how balanced you feel.<P>UNDER_DOG</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>DIlbahadur,<P>I agree with what you said in your post about us being hybrids or not.  But i do still think were hybrids nontheless.  You had very good points, and after reading it made me think.<P>Yes were a bit less than hybrids. But i think were still.<P>About the song twisting:<P>Yes it is EXTREMELLY unfair for people with slow computers or slow connections.  I can say i am blesses for having a prety decent computer and 56k connection.  At earlier levels i started practicing twisting 4 songs.  Currently i constantly keep 4 songs twisted without any problem.  At some moments i even throw in a 5th song to the twist, but i can only maintain this twist for like 1 second, becuase after that the first one drops off.  But, heres what hapenes.  I have also played my bard on a slower computer, and i mean it is very hard to maintain 3 songs when the spell gem ungray very slwly and you dont know when to start the other one.  When i get connection lag (left number gets over 500 or something), it gets also very hard to keep 3.<P>Now do i ask, is it fair for bard with slower computers or connections?  No.  It isnt fair.  Although twisting songs is 70% the players ability, the other 30%, which is you computers performance, can ruin it all. <P>So please check this out and see if you guys can come with a way for bards to be able to twist songs without "prejudice".  Maybe hotkeys, maybe some skill in game, ...anything.  Just make it fair for everyone.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am a newbie so I will talk about some low level stuff, and my English is not too well, please forgive me.<P>ITEM: Gate<P>DESCRIPTION: As all I know Bard is the only class need to run across two island(or four?) in order to buy their spell, you know how upset when I know I need to run to Kelethin to buy the level 8 song "Kelin's Lugubrious Lament" when I am a Bard that born in Qeynos ? Run to there ? It take how many hours ? So you say I can looking for a port ? How can a level 8 newbie have that much money to pay for one ? Looking for free porter is time consuming and paying for a port to buy spell mean cost of the spell increase, buying many spell at once is also not possible for a newbie since a newbie have too many thing that need to spend money, armor, weapon etc.. so a personal gate will be nice, you can make it can only cast in the Bard Guild and only can gate to bard guild, cost *all* of your mana etc...<P>ITEM: Mana<P>DESCRIPTION: Bard song is weak some of them near useless, why ? Because you can cast while walking and cost no mana.. please... can you make some way for me to use my mana ? If is not funny to FM all the time, I would like to cost my mana to incease the effect of my song, say have a abilty to choice use mana or not when sing, if I use my mana then the effect will become better or less likely being resist or will take hold for a reasonable long period etc... but I think it is hard to make such a change right now, but it is nice to have some cost mana version of some old song.<P>ITEM: Channelling<P>DESCRIPTION: Every caster have the ability to regain concentration, how about Bard ? You know for a Bard it is dispell all the 3 effect<P>ITEM: Do a little of everything quite well<P>DESCRIPTION: A Bard is a class that do a little of everything quite well but master of none, yes I agree that I can do a little of everything but *not* well, below is some example :<P>Meditate - Cap at level 1, I am level 30 right now but the speed to mem a lvl 1 song is somewhat slower that a level 4 Mage mem his newest spell<P>Safe Fall - Cap at 40, with that level I can't jump from anywhere that someone will start to think it is high without taking any damage, this skill level is some what for our speed song only right now<P>Hide - Cap at 40, skill 40 don't mean you have 40% change to success, and 40% change to success is somewhat useless... and can you please change the message of hide ( as well as sneak ) so that we know am I successfully hide ( sneak ) ? I press F9 I change my view and view myself hided but everyone saw me as well as mob.<P>Forage - Cap at 55, With this skill level this skill just can not become my food source... can you please raise this skill to a level that I can find food most of the time but I won't find most or any special item with this skill ?<P>Hymn of Restoration - I call this song "Song of Bind Wound" because it heal more or less the same as the rate a melee calss Bind Wound, if I do healing quite well how can I heal slower than a Paladin ? OR you will say you healing 6 at once but this note that it is race to have more than 3 ppl hurt if you are in a good group<P>ITEM: Language Song<P>DESCRIPTION: Here is and idea, maybe it is good for adding some more effective song, I don't know, what I mean that a Song that you need to know the language in order to sing it, and the song is prefer to get from a quest as well, and maybe it is also a good solution for the Bind ability, you need to know the language of that city in order to Bind there lol<P>ITEM: Cast Time<P>DESCRIPTION: In real life, 30s is a song, 10min is a song, 1hr is a song, and the song take effect after finish singing the whole song is also make sense, why don't make some song have long cast time ( and cost mana ) but have better effect ? You know longer cast time for a Bard mean it have a greater change being stun, and it make sense to have better effect, e.g. sing for 1 min. and cost me 600 mana for a group buff that will take hold for reasonable long period of time<P>ITEM: Selo's Accelerando<P>DESCRIPTION: I can see the reason can't use SoW indoor, but I really didn't see the reason why this song can't sing in indoor... And everyone know Bard is the faster class, so I think make this song can sing indoor won't hurt any class<P>ITEM: Defense<P>DESCRIPTION: Hybrid class is created base on Warrior, while they gain some ability that Warrior didn't have and they loss some of the ability which Warrior have, say Paladin they have less HP and AC then Warrior, but they have HP and AC buff, but what Bard got ? Bard have lower HP and AC then Paladin but didn't got buff to buff it up, and all the effect of the song will loss if being stun, I think it is better to increase the HP, AC etc.. for Bards or make some song effect can take hold for a reasonable long period<P>ITEM: Number of Target<P>DESCRIPTION: Another reason why Bard song weak is because Bard song affect all the group member, but please note that the effect of the song in most case is *not* want by all of the member, healing won't want by who got full HP, hate, STR, AC buff won't want by pure caster type, and mana song won't want by pure melee type, so please design the song effect with this in mine, and why most class can choice to use their spell on one or group target and us Bards can't ?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Bards melee weak compared to any melee or hybrid class. All bards cast weak compared to any hybrid or caster class. <BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<P>At each stage in a bard's life EXCEPT post-50, there is a fair variety for methods of play.<P>Our damage at lower levels while duel wielding & using our buffs as well as other classes buffs aren't so bad, though our tanking ability dramatically reduces post level 15.<P>However, this does not ruin our ability to play altogether.  Yes, we can melee.  But the ability to double attack would overbalance us in the pre-50 game.  Giving us double attack post 50 could potentially help, yes, but personally -- and i know from the responses I've read that others agree with me -- I would rather see resist's on our song's lowered so they can be effective against post 50 encounters, and the amount of damage (and for the chant's series, as well as our new velious song for lowering resist's, to increase the amount they drop resist's by) to scale better in the post 50 game to be more compareable to other classes.<P>I feel this way because I've done the math, I've seen how much potential damage a bard can do if their song's don't resist as much, and it can still <P>When high level bard's have posted timings and such of the damage they can deal with their melee skills using nice haste items and a high end haste buffs, none of them has topped 1500 damage a minute that I've seen, though I'm sure someone might have enough high end equipment to pull it off.<P>Now, add in double attack, and let's just assume for a minute that it actually works most of the time, and we'll give them 90% more damage, assuming they can actually deal 1500 damage a minute.  This will place the bard at 2850 damage a minute, with just melee skills.<P>Not so bad ... but then, most bards can't get all of this equipment.  Should the resist's on song's be lowered enough that their usefull in a majority of situations post 50, ANY bard has the potential to deal as much as 1500-2000 damage a minute just using chant's and a decent drum (any of the magical drums available in fact ... preferably selo's of course).  Add in the fact their dropping resist's for casters to nuke, the damage output their creating is unguessably higher.<P>Personally I'd like to see a poison and disease based chant's to account for the situations in which something is completely fire, cold, or magic resistant (or a combination of the 3), so we can still provide damage output and not get gimped by the resistance of that creature.<P>If you take any of the AVERAGE bards, not those equipped with extremely good gear ... I'm close to doubling the amount of damage they deal.  I'm still besting post 50 bards with very high end gear (in some cases the best).  I think it's pathetic that we're reduced to this, but I do not feel that better melee skills are our answer.  If you hate being a mana battery so much, why do you fight to be a mana battery who can swing weapons better?<P>-Desbarolis -- 47th bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Speaking of the drum graphic and other bad instrument graphics, read the reply on the paladin talk from Absor.  Apparently, the paladin epic graphic which is messed up (and affects a few paladins per server at most, and only has been a problem for a few months) has already been sent to be fixed.  This is while we are being told that fixing the drum graphic is a "low priority" even though it has been a problem for bards since the beginning.<P>Obviously, bards are not one of the favored classes.  This is just another example of how the "vision" does not include bards (with instruments). </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sigh where to begin...<BR> ok I read most of the replies and man it took a while (absor i feel 4u). As I read I saw some good ideas and a few just bad ones. I think someone wanted a pet, but I sure don't. One more reason for a mob to come kill me. Plus the mechanics of a pet song are just hard to imagine, but i digress...<P>Skills:<BR>   Please, make defensive skill caps higher (parry, riposte, and dodge). I would like to use my rogue heritage from classic lore. And like a rogue I think I should sneak and hide as they do, at maybe a quarter rogue skill (or half), not enough to really be usefull in pressured situations.<P>   Leave Offensive skills alone a bard's extra damage ought to come from his Hastes and songs. Example: A solo bard should deal damage slightly less than an unbuffed untwinked pally or Sk.<P>Songs:<P>     Please make the haste songs stack with spells because they are two different types of effects. Heck most songs should stack with spells and a bunch of them do stack, so why not hastes?<BR>     Perhaps a Feign Death song should be introduced post 50 self-only and untwistable.<BR>     Some other revisions should be looked at that I feel are better documented in other posts (pixie strike should work on higher mobs too).<BR>    <BR>Items: <P>     We all agree that some Singing Steel pieces need work on their effects. Oh yeah Bard Ac is fine we just need those defense skills. And please fix the stupid percussion animation. That's just lazyness<P>Anyway that's all I can think of.<P>Depain Del'gato 33 Bard of Nameless.<P>PS Where's Doofy(Drinal)? I'd like to know what he thinks.
