I'll have to rely on you folks to tell me all I need to know about enchanters… <BR>Again, the usual reminder. I am primarily looking for balance concerns here. But I am certainly willing to put bugs on the list. Also, though I really do understand the fact that you want to emphasize and back up statements by others, please, please try to keep the repeat information to a minimum. I'm finding that by page three or four on these threads I'm rereading the same suggestions by people that start their posts with "I didn't read this thread, so I don't know if this had been said…" I don't want to stifle any creativity. But I have to admit that I tend to get bleary eyed reading the same suggestions over and over again, and I know I'm missing good new ideas late in threads when they are buried among things that others have covered several times before.<P>So, please, let's hear what you think is unbalanced or broken about enchanters. Here are the few things that I had already jotted down:<P>Gift of Brilliance: When compared to similar buffs by Clerics and Shamans this spell doesn’t seem good enough. Sure, it will see use, but it could be a better spell. Quick comparison:<P>Aeogolism (60th level Cleric spell): Adds 1,100 to max hit points and 54 to AC for a single target. Lasts 2.5 hours. Costs 750 mana.<BR>Focus of the Spirit (60th level Shaman spell): Adds 405 hit points, 67 strength and 60 dexterity for a single target. Lasts 1.5 hours. Costs 500 mana.<BR>Gift of Brilliance (50th level Enchanter spell): Adds 150 mana and grants a mana regeneration rate increase of 2 points per tick for a single target. Lasts 1.5 hours. Costs 450 mana.<P>The Shaman and Cleric spells essentially replace other buffs. Gift of Brilliance stacks with Clarity II. It might be nice to have the mana regeneration be 2 points greater than Clarity II and NOT stack with it so that enchanters could use it to save a slot. And perhaps rather than increasing the mana bonus, give it an intelligence bonus. But perhaps at this level enchanters just don't need any more intelligence boosts…<P>Illusions drop when zoning: Is there a gameplay reason behind the fact that illusions drop when you zone? If not, can we make it so they do not?<P>More Illusions: I think it’s a good idea to dig through the list of current global characters and see if there are a few more illusions that we can give to enchanters.<P>I know there are more issues…<P>Alan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'll make it short:<P>1) Change alignment penalties so people aren't penalized so badly for chosing a religion.  The negitives far outweigh the few items that require you to be of a certain religion.<P>2) Make our str debuff spells actually work, reducing the amount of melee damage done AND reducing the movement speed, the same way it does on players.<P>3) More illusions, that stress **alignment** over stat buffs.  We don't melee much at all, so what is the point of melee bonuses for werewolf?  Take effects off and put more alignment changing things on.  (Wolf should be indifferent to most animals, skeleton should be indifferent to most undead, etc)<P>4) Evoke training spell<P>5) On PvP servers, AoE should NOT effect pets or groupmates.  Makes the lines useless when you cant use them if you have a pet/group.<P>6) DDs/DoTs that aren't based on all magic, and DD's that aren't full damage or no damage.  Something so we can not have 3 complete resists in a row and lose half a bar of mana.<P>7) Increase Tashan line effectiveness so it is on par with Kunark and especially Velious MR raise.  Lessen aggro so we don't get killed in 3 hits after casting it on boss mobs.<P><BR>These are basic changes that will effect everyone positively, not just groups of levels.  I urge the people who are making these changes to make sure they effect everyone, not just 50+ enchanters.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Alright, Time to RECAP FOR OUR VI FRIENDS.<BR>This is my try at a summary of the things that we wish to be fixed for our beloved class, and at last, things that we wish would be changed. I'll take a backseat conservative type of approach to this to appease as many as I can, while staying well within our bounds of power.<BR>1) PROBLEM:<BR>Getting Killed Frequently, Taunt, Defence, HP, and AC.<P>TREND:<BR>I've read all the threads, and it seems that the root of all these problems are the insanely high taunt rates of our spells. If we did not have such high taunts, we would not be aggroed so much, and we would therefore be hit less. This would eliminate large changes to Equipment, Hp, Defence, or AC. It would also eliminate the complete need for escape spells, even though they would still be nice.<P>SOLUTION:<BR>Lower taunts on all spells such as Mez, Charm, DD's, Tashan, and Stuns. This would stop the general trend of spell resisted == Instant MoBs on you. -- This would solve all of these balance issues, and would NOT require major changes to the position or use of the Enchanter as it is.<P>2) PROBLEM:<BR>Illusions do not change religous factions, which disallow quite a few enchanters any way to get into areas that they should be able to go with Illusions.<P>TREND:<BR>Did not know that religion would be a hinderance later in life when they picked it.<P>SOLUTION:<BR>Give a quest that allows us to return to Agnostic. Not too difficult, so that those who do not have the time to play too much may accomplish it as well. Or compensate.<P>3) WTYH LINE PROBLEM:<BR>Pets, tanks, and other melee types, consistantly break this spells hold, and it would otherwise be a wonderful addition to the arsenal.<P>TREND:<BR>WTYH connects, holds, and affects the monster. A matter of seconds later, the MoB is able to break it for it was bashed or attacked alternately. Immediately comes running to the Enchanter infuriated.<P>SOLUTION:<BR>1) Make MoBs that are WTYH'ed un-bashable, slammable, and other such attacks that would have a similar spell breaking affect.<BR>2} Make it so that WTYH does not break from bashes and such skills.<P>4) DD and DoT PROBLEMS:<BR>See taunt issue above.<P>SOLUTION:<BR>At current, most seem to be agreeing that we are alright in this sector, we are not the major damage dealers, yet it would be nice.<P>5) TASHAN LINE PROBLEMS:<BR>See taunt issue above. Restore Tashania is it? <P>SOLUTION:<BR>To a more powerful - as it was previous or about that - state.<P>6) MEMORY BLUR PROBLEMS:<BR>This is a great idea, and it would be absolutely wonderful, if it worked.<P>TREND:<BR>No resist or inaffective message, no way of knowing what worked unless it stops attacking you, if it's not an aggro MoB. No way to call pet off. Too high resists. Too high casting time.<P>SOLUTION:<BR>Decrease resist rate, mana, casting time, and recast of any form. This would allow us to use it as an escape spell.<P>POSSIBLE WISH LIST:<P>MEZMERIZE: Lower resists at higher levels.<P>CHARM:<BR>Possibly make this spell more reliable for monsters under even or blue con, which would be reasonable. If this is seen as 'unbalancing' you may remove our pet spells, as they are useless in their current state anyway.<P>STUNS:<BR>These seem to be less of an issue than almost anything else, yet still note-worthy.<BR>-- DURATION:<BR>Stuns seem to be very, very short compared to their cast/mana cost/recast time. -- Increase Stun Duration.<BR>-- RANGE:<BR>Stuns have such a small range that it puts the Enchanter in danger to cast these. -- Increase Range.<BR>-- RECAST TIME:<BR>Much longer than needed recast time on these spells than there should be. -- Lower recast time.<P>PETS/CHARM: I shall not say much about this, for we seem not to have come to any form of concensus on this issue. If we do not stand united we do not stand at all. There is one general consensus at the moment: Pets are too weak, and charm is not nearly as reliable as it should be. Also see Taunt Issue and Charm Issue.<P>MEM BLUR SHIELD:<BR>People seem to agree that this is a nice idea, and that it would most definitely help enchanters to survive in battle more. Once hit, and hti again, and again, it shall decrease aggro based on level and skill. One of those one on one psychology sessions where they tell you to "Hit the pillow, and get your anger out." -- In this case, it's us.<P>RUNE IV/V:<BR>Component costs seem too high. Hardly soaks up any damage to survive.<P>SNARE:<BR>As suggested before, a spell that could possibly be like the suggested 'Stagger' would be great. Like an Snare type spell. It's within our range of powers. 'Stagger,' would affect the mind of the beholder, so that the target would be in a bit of a feverish dazed state, and have normal function, yet stagger around as if very wobbly on the legs.<P>DOPPLEGANGER TYPES: I, personally, think these are a good idea. Yet we should keep requests simple for now, and see what ground we can gain later.<P>Thx for your time,<BR>Incendus FuryFyre, The One of Many Names<BR>-- We fight a different battle, one of the mind.<P>P.S.<BR>If I've got this all wrong, tell me!<BR>tearshard@darkmail.com</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>CROWD CONTROL:<BR>+ Blame Spell: assigns all of your aggro to a party member (perhaps bring up a "Enchanter_01  wishes to blame you for his crimes.  Do you wish this?  Yes / No" window), or just have it be an instantaneous, quick-casting thing.  Probably make it a high level quest spell, as this isn't a big problem until level 50+ dungeons, etc.<P>+ Shield of Forgetfulness (Thank you TenZel for this idea).  A shield that, when hit, memory blurs the thing hitting it.<P>+ Edict of Sarbo:  Enchanter_00 says, "You will not evade me, Orc_Pawn_91."  *An Orc Pawn has been SUMMONED.*   Great for pulling, if you're into suicide, great for preventing mobs from fleeing (or gating or whatever).<P>+ Delayed Amnesia:  Also a good idea... a memory blur that occurs 6-12 seconds after it lands.<P>BUFFING AND TEDIUM:<BR>* Mana and time costs of buffs:  Aegolism-like spells that cover Casters (Components: Gift of Brilliance, Clarity 2) at the very least.  <P>* Area of Effect Clarity and Clarity 2.  <P>* Group versions of our other buffs: Group Rune V would be keen.  Group Augment would also be helpful (believe it or not).  Group Arch Shielding (go ahead and make it a casting time of 45 or 60) would be fantastic (and kinda epic, I think... like wizard portals are, for example) and would provide very measurable benefits in certain situations.<P><BR>Maldisdain Atheist<BR>*** Illusionist ***<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok folks...  I see a lot of repetitive talk so lets try to make Alan's work a little more easier so here is a list of things that have currently been brought up.  So please do not repeat this information so that alan has to wade thru needless post.<P>Tashani line spells--- problem with taunt factor                     and people want the MR                    reduction returned<P>WTYH line spells -- problems with how this line of spell, because stuns (ie slam/bash) break the spell<P>illusions --- people want to get rid of the religion faction when they cast an illusion... some people want more illusions there is more so read ALan's post regarding zoning issues and such<P>Velious issues --- unmezzable creatures, can't do crowd control... uber high magic resists... discourages enchanters to goto this continent<P>Strength debuff line spells --- problem is that creatures are not weighted down by equipment like PC's so they do not become encumbered like PC's when strength debuffs are layered on them.  Some people have brought this up  I am suggested replacing choke line spells with one that uses gravity to effect the creature.  Works the same as choke but gives the creature X amount of weight so as to allow the creature to become encumbered and be effected like a PC when he/she is debuffed. (i would not allow this to be used on PC's for it would be too powerful)<P>Memory blur and its effectiveness<P>charm spells and pets have been covered very well so if you have a unique idea then post it if not then don't post it.  We have had many post on how we should give our pets commands and how we should be able to charm our pet and how charms should let us know when the charm is about to fail (or go)<P>Rune spell components -- people state that it is too high in price.<P>Snare like effects --- umm my gravity line instead of choke series spells would give this effect to a certain extent and it fixes the strength debuff problem.. but don't think we will be getting snare or engulfing darkness anytime soon.<P>SOW on our wolf image...  um don't hold your breath... if you want sow then buy the potions like everyone else does or beg for it don't think they would give us even a little personal sow for us.<P>Calm line spells --- thats a thorn in our side no one really ever uses that spell<P>So to recap please post new interesting ideas or solutions to our concerns.  Before you post think it out... has it been posted before... can you abuse this idea and if you can then tone the spell idea or concept down... think how your idea can be abused in a group and with other spells. We want to be unique and fill a niche that no one else fits.. (ie crowd control an such not jsut plain buffers bleh)<BR> <P> ie. My memory blur shield idea (which is self only) in combonation with a rune spell might allow us to survive a hit or two. but if we made the memblur shield targetable then think of how everyone would abuse it.  Or if the shield lasted a long duration... one would just keep casting berserker strength line spells on themselves and they would never be touched.  One draw back of the shield is that you have to waste a spell splot on it which really hurts an enchanter <P><BR>So all in all state the problem then your unique idea. Do not recap on previous ideas constantly unless you are lucky enough to be at the top of page on a post then repost a recap so people will stop spamming the same ideas such as ummm... i want more illusions or tashan type spells have too much aggro.<P>This was not entended as a flame or such but I just want to cut out some of the repetition that is occurring.  Even those that repeat the same information are stating very important concerns that all of us agree on. So good luck on your ideas and concerns!<P>Zelbee Silvertongue<BR>Let all of us enchanters unite!<BR>We can solve the problems that plague us.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>As some people have mentioned please take a look at the enchanter epic.  <P>Magician epic:  Manifest elements (basically a God pet)<P>Monks, sk's, warriors, bards, paladins, rogues, rangers get very nice weapon epics.<P>Shamans get an epic with a very nice dot.<P>Druids get a snare/dot.<P>Wizards get a self buff which also increases mana regen.<P>Clerics get a free casting rez.<P>Necromancers get torment of shadows, snare/dot.<P>Enchanters get an epic to buff other people.  The only reason we would use it on ourselves is beacuase it is free mana.  Augment has greater AC as stated previously and benefits the caster much better than our epic.  To be honest I'd rather use up mana casting augment on people and have an epic that actually helped my chances of some type of survival rather than constantly being a buff mojo.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok folks i need your help and input on this idea... this is in regards to velious problems with high MR creatures and for those on pvp servers they have problems with the ease it is for one to obtain 100 + MR.  This idea of mine would also allow enchanters to effect the uber mobs and plane mobs.<P>Here it goes.. (snicker) i am gonna need help on this idea so it does not become too unbalancing... tis a fine line we have to walk<P>Name of spell "Mystic Chains of Chaos"<P>what does it do?  It supliments the Tashan line spells. by doing this Verant could reduce the taunt on this spell and it would be fixed.<P>Now what does it do?  Well it takes the MR of a creature and uses it against that creature.  The higher the MR the more deadly the spell is.<P>Don't know what level to give this at but imagine you have 2 creatures one with 100 MR and another with 50 MR without using tash line spells this spell would do a percentage damage based on the creatures MR and debuff its MR based on its MR.<P>example 100 MR creature --- do 10 % damage/tick<BR>                                10 % MR reduction<BR>so that creature would take<BR>10 damage a tick and would initially lose 10 MR<BR>-- in pvp settings the person only takes 66% damage so it would be 6 damage a tick and  lose 10 MR (even less damage if the player or creature is moving due to that if you move DoT's do less damage)<P>now the creature with the 50 MR would take 5 damage a tick and only 5 MR.<P>If one stacks tashan line spells with it the power of spell decreases. so if you cast the first spell to get the 10 damage a tick and 10 MR reduction then you cast tashani for the 20 MR debuff then the total MR reduction would be 28 (20 from tashani and 8 from the first spell)<P>So my ideas are to to do a % damage per tick (DoT) based on the targets MR. And  a % MR debuff depending on the targets initial MR.  Make this spell unresistable.<P>By doing this one will allow enchanters to be effective in PvE and PvP environments where the abuse of uber high MR comes into play.  Think who the tashan line spells ( the higher ones) where reduced.  Do not put the tashan line spells back to the high MR debuff (60ish i believe) but allow us this series of spell to stack.  I like the idea of taking a high MR and using it against the target.<P>ok here is an example of me manipulating some numbers<P>level 20 spell *shrug*<BR>10 % damage a tick and 10 % initial MR<P>100 MR creature            50 MR creature<P>---10 damage/tick        --  5 damage/tick<BR> 10 MR debuff               5 MR debuff<P>20 ticks later<P>200 damage                   100 damage<BR>-10 MR                         -5 MR<P>But one must remember that creatures heal while they are still alive and if the creature is moving the damage of a DoT is lowered.  And in PvP environment the damage is further reduced to 66%<P>now if you casted tashani on the beasts then<BR>total MR reduction on the 100 MR creature would be 28 and the 50 MR creature would be 23 MR<P>which then gives you <P>100-28=72 MR             50-23=27 MR<P>7 damage/tick              3 damage/tick<P>20 ticks later<P>140 damage total            60 damage total<P>anyways... please give you input... these are just numbers i plugged in.  See what you think.  you can play with the % damage and % MR debuff depending on the level of the spell.  <P><BR>Zelbee Silvertongue<BR>I like this idea but i need help<BR>filling in the holes in my idea.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Regarding the epic quest posts...  what about giving the epic weapon a clickable memory-blur shield spell that is self only that can be cast once per fight?  Have like a X amout recast time and a X amount duration.  So that for the first part of the battle one can use the memory-blur shield effect and successfully survive casting tashan line spells and mezzin' the initial mob.  Don't have the spell last the entire fight but i think people would like this more then being "mojo buff person"<P>Or give the epic weapon a clickable workable memory-blur spell that is unresistable.  Need a very fast casting time on this.  So that if we get hit we can try memory blurring the beast off of us before we die.

To crowd control creatures that have a DoT on it, un-mezzable creatures. <P>Draw backs... if people attack the target creature  they have a chance of taunting the target creature off of the illusionary foe for the illusionary foe is not doing real damage but has a very high taunt skill so a wizzy or a warrior could easily pull the creature off of the illusionary foe.<P>Mezzes are better but can not be used in all areas (ie against giants)<P>Unbalance issues would be if one could cast this on one creature and keep your groups aggro down so that you could beat on the creature and the creature would only beat on the Illusion.  This is impossible for the creature can only taunt and do no real damage.  The people in the group would out aggro the illusion vary fast.

</FONT><HR>This modification might be too difficult, but it would be very nice. At level 30, and every 5 levels thereafter, the enchanter gets another Spell Gem on a new UI box. Enchanters (and Bards) are constantly in need of additional spell gems to keep more memorized. This wouldn't unduly power the enchanters, but it would be something to give them since they've been so effectively screwed.<P>-----------------<BR>Mico</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Nunber 1 Religious Faction<BR> You have created a Fantasy RolePlaying game and then made it impossible for Enchanters to roleplay. You have granted all NPCs the ability to read our thoughts. Something not even us masters of the mind are unable to do. Choosing a deity does nothing other than add to the roleplaying aspect and yet we are penalized for doing so. We must choose whether to roleplay or become agnostic to be able to fairly compete with other Enchanters. I don't want a quest that allows me to become agnostic, I simply want my religous beliefs hidden to any who do not actually have the ability to read my thoughts. <P>Number 2 Mezz/charm<BR>Some kind of clue when mezz/charm is fading that doesn't involve my personal health being diminished. Maybe a message 10 or even 5 seconds before it goes. Ex. "%T starts to blink and looks bewildered". <P>Number 3 Pets<BR>Personally I always choose a "pet" rather than charm just for the safety factor. On the other hand I think charm is more in line with the way that at least I perceive Enchanters to be. An animation is still something summoned and belongs to the Mages and Necros. But if we are to have pets then I would like just one command. "/pet back off". Gets real frustrating when I tell people to /assist tank and then have my own pet preventing me from successfully Mezzing. Or to have to tell people to forget what I said and now assist pet. Also gets real frustrating not being able to target a mob because pet is always standing between you and target no matter where you move.<P>Wish list<BR>Mirror image illusion. <BR>Something that would disappear when hit but would give you at least a chance to survive when being attacked by mob(s) that just broke charm/mezz or generally unhappy with having their magic resistance being lowered. We just die too quick, too often.<P>Enchanting<BR>To actually be able enchant without having to take up a very expensive trade skill.<BR>Actually having a use for our vials of mana. I like the suggestion of a vial of 200 mana, even if no rent.    <BR>Maybe creating actual Runes from the Rune spell. Then I could just sell them and maybe get back some of the money I have spent to save someone elses arse. Something the group expects of you but never offers to pay for. Personally I would rather have the 10PP the spell cost to cast rather than a "thank you for saving my life". <P>Arichiena on Prexus<BR>If I seem to be playing intelligently<BR>then you have just witnessed my greatest illusion</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Only problem would be those that hunt guards for exp and I have no respect for those folks anyway.  Level 50-60 guards would do I believe.  Those guards if properly adjusted could make life hard.  But put a dragon in the skin of a guard that melees is ridiculous.  EQ is one step from UO... just need to let the guards teleport to a disturbance and give them summon hero too *bleh*  I miss the days when the forces of Dark razed the High Elf city... tis a shame that those same groups o' people could not take on just two of those uber UO guards.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Enchanters are the masters of the mind, but they don't seemed to be designed that way.<P>hmm... spell gems...<P>Change Gift of Magic to provide an extra spell gem *or* lower the spell to lvl 4-12; 50 mana isn't too useful at higher levels but an extra spell gem would be.<P>spirit wolf illusion.  if you're going to give us the druid's limitations (i.e. outdoors only spell) then please give us their benefits (i.e. sow).  Fire elemental has a fire dmg shield, drybone skele has +fire resist, air elemental has levitation, troll illusion has regen, inkie illusion has ultravision, so why not spirit wolf illusion with sow?<P>Masters of the mind, well, not outdoors.  How it is that a lvl 5 druid with Harmony can break a camp of red mobs with 0% chance of failure but an enchanter 10x the druid's level can't get anywhere near the same success rate?  Outdoors at a monster camp, it's STUPID to have the enchanter pull when there's a druid or ranger with harmony in the group.  Harmony is NEVER resisted.  Calm/Lull spells are broken in that they DO aggro when resisted (which is damn near all the time).  Did I mention Harmony is unresistable?<P>I'm not jealous of druids, really.  But I'm jealous of the support their receive from VI developers; that's probably just my perception.  Necros tend to be the VI's favorite class.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Jewelery needs to wear out.  On mature servers (which is nearly all the servers now), the # of jewelry producers keeps increasing.  The number of buyers keeps decreasing.  Why?  New players get jewelry from older players that upgrade to more expensive jewelry.  Since jewelry never wears out, they're simply handed down to the next generation of players (or guild members) or auctioned off under cost.  If trade skill produced items became NORENT after they've existed in game for 20 days of playtime, there would be an actual economy for player made goods (and a money sink to dispose of the cash coming into the world from mobs).  From a programming point of view, you need a dword to count the playtime for each player made item.  After 20 days of playtime (if you only play 4 hours a day, that's four months of real time), you get a message saying "such and such is wearing out" and the item gets flagged as norent.  you need to replace it or the item disappears when you log.  The currently useless IDENTIFY spell could give you the amount of playtime left on a player crafted item (items could have more or less playtime on them depending on the skill of the creator).  Hmm.. think of the item repair skills you could introduce into the game to allow players to keep their existing items.  A second epic quest to repair their epic quest item (which would have a playtime of about 50-60 days [about a six months to a year real time] before becoming norent)...  If you spend the time/money to get it, you need to spend the time/money to keep it.<P>Add a new resist category.  Because of ROOT, SNARE, and other magic based spells used by other classes, mobs get high magic resist.  But ALL spells by enchanters are magic based; so raising the MR on a mob to prevent it from being snared also eliminates the possibility of an enchanter directly affecting the mob.  Make a new class of resost and recategorize all enchanter spells as saving against that category.  Say MIND based spells which is different than MAGIC based spells.  Magic resist can stay high but you can tune the MIND resist levels to compensate for enchanter based spells.  Taking a look at enchanter spells, virtually all of them could be considered to be MIND based spells (except root series, buffs [shielding], pet spells, and enchantment spells).<P>Eye of Confusion.  Works like fear when mob is tryign to get to you (mob runs away while trying to get to the person it hates most).  Change it so that the mob changes direction every three seconds; as it stands, the mob runs away like it's feared.  It's supposed to confuse them and make them run around randomly, not make them run directly away like fear.  Spell would be useful in dungeons if it kept the mob from running far.<P>Specialization Buff.  Increases your specilization skill level by X number of points.  Self only.  Lets enchanter's magic based spells stick on highly magic resistant mobs BUT only in the spell type we specialized in.  Alleviates the high MR problem and is limited to the family of magic spells we chose to specialize in (alteration, conjuration, evocatation, divination).  No specialization?  No effect.  We live and die by the monster's magic resist; we need something to make our spells stick.  Enchanters should be able to make root stick when it fails for all other classes.<P>Epic Quest item.  A combat melee buff... *sigh*  Perhaps an analogy would help VI recognize what a mistake this is.  Suppose the Warrior Epic Quest sword has unlimited right-click clarity and +30 INT.  Warriors would be ticked and calling VI various four letter words.  You don't give a class a buff they can't use; so why did we get a combat melee buff?  We have the lowest HP in the game, we don't melee (except for the suicidal enchanters among us), and we don't do stupid things (or we wouldn't be a high lvl enchanter).  How about a buff we can use?  C2, SoW, RuneV, heck an unresistable CALM spell with no aggro (*cough* single target harmony *cough*).  Enchanters don't like having an epic quest item that they can't use.  We do get upset but we don't use four letter words; we use six and eight letter words to describe this distored version of the Vision(tm).<P>WHAT happened the jewelycrafting from 191 skill onwards?  Yes it's supposed to be more difficult, but 120 success and 50 failures later, NO SKILL GAIN on plat jewelry (all non-trivial combination).  Change this so that after "X" attempts, you WILL gain skill.  If someone is going to do 40 attempts, they should gain skill wether they succeed or not as along as everything they do is non-trivial.<P>Regarding taunt on enchanter spells.  Self-only invis that removes enchanter from ALL hate list IF the enchanter doesn't move, doesn't cast, and doesn't sit.  Any DOT's cast by the enchanter has a CHANCE of makign the enchanter visible (same chance as root breaking).  Same random duration as normal invis.  If we break invis (attack, move, cast, or sit to med), we go to the TOP of the mobs hate list.  Spell alleviates enchanters' complaint about aggroing multiple mobs and dying fast, and spell has enough limitations that it isn't prone to abuse.  And spell would have to be very fast cast (fast like AE stun spells).  Example use, enchanter tries to stop a train and AE mezzes six out of ten mobs.  four start beating up the enchanter.  Enchanter self-invis; now group has to deal with the four mobs on the enchanter without the enchanter's help.  if enchanter doesn't move, cast, attack, or med, the mobs will go back to spawn position (like feign death).  Unlike the monk feign death, the enchanter could become visible at any moment (what else is new).  Make this a low lvl spell  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Enchant Weapon.  Cast on a FS weapon, uses an enchanted gem (there needs to be different degrees of enchant gem spells which could use the mana vial line of spells as spell components) as spell component, make the FS weapon proc a spell.  Weapon is NORENT and converts back to normal FS status when user logs out.  We were promised enchanting weapons...<P>Pet fix.  /pet disassemble and /pet reassemble.  Makes enchanted pet collapse to ground and STAY PUT (think of a dead shadowman on the ground look).  Second command "wakes up" pet and it automagically guards the enchanter.  Pet is a magic item, we should be have an on-off switch to the pet.<P>Friend spell.  Copies faction of a target NPC to yourself.  Random duration, no warning message when it stops.  No warning... makes the impossible quests possible.  Gives a way around the religon faction problem.  No warning when it drops (no spell icon either, like benevolence) is the limitation.  Duration is not based on level but is totally random from 10 seconds to 4 minutes and cannot be recast until it drops on it's own.  Makes corpse recovery dangerous (as it should be) because spell is has unreliable duration.  This should be a fairly low lvl spells like invisibility; totally unreliable spell with huge risks, but at time the only way to get things done.<P>Regards,<BR>Sorcea of Tunare<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, how do I balance my main class?  i've read most of the post now and have come to a few conclusions.  I'll try not to be too sarcastic when I point out flaws in my class. <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"><P>illusions do not balance a group:<BR>Agreed.  As per the "Vision" the ability to travel safely in dangerous zones is an "unique" ability of the rogue class.  We just "thought" that was an ability of ours because we thought factions are based on race more then religon.  Think about it.  If it wasnt for this ability of illusion, you would not have to go to a KOS city twice just to get a spell you need.(tashania)  afterall, wouldnt you like to get the already nerfed spell the easy way just like anyother class?  if there wasnt any illusions you would be able to get the spell easy because you wouldnt be forced to do the quest.  considering ALL of your spells except tash line are magic based wouldnt you prefer not have to die if your invis drops?  Is the "cool" factor really worth worrying about your factions 100 time more then your friends?  If you want illusions, go play the class which the "Vision" intended for them.  play a rogue or bard.  what about the title "illusionist" you say?  that's just a name,  has nothing to do with the "Vision"  afterall there is no such ability as "Phantasmist" in all EQ.  It's just a name.  doesnt have anything to do with the "Vision"  whoever wrote it didn't consult with the game designer and gave those titles anyway.<P>tash need less taunt:<BR>Disagree. I've often used tash to pull mobs off the wizzy channeling out an evac as I leveled up.  All of our spells have uber taunt anyway so what's lowering the taunt for 1 line of spells going do for you?  Learn to play with taunt.  Taunt is your friend.  If you dont like the hot seat, pack a few backstabbing rogues in your pocket while you travel.  this way you can play ping pong with them.  Any enchanter can tell you that we are the only caster class qualified to tank for a group.  after all if you don't channel that mez through, the team is dead anyway.  Enc has always been a thinking man's class,  so start thinking Borg:  we are Borg, we will adapt.  so better learn to play with taunt and learn to tank for your group.  Otherwise, go play some other class.  Don't feel bad, the "Vision" didnt tell me I was supposed to be a tank either.  I had to learn the hard way.<P>mez should be resisted less<BR>Mixed feelings.  As I've just recently found out that the "Vision" does not intend for me to control traffic because by doing so, I alone am acting as several groups of players and are deemed "too powerful" by the "Vision"  While I agree that our class should have some unique ability in controlling traffic that is beyond the ability of the necro, bard, and all other root/fear enabled classes, I can see that having the ability to control traffic so that people dont die and lose days of /played time because the puller had a lag spike and trained the zone can be "too powerful".  So the question is how do you nerf this all powerful life saving class?  simple.  Kill them.  1 resist and 1 intrupt should do it if intrupt "works as intended"  if not, 2 resists will always do the job.  That will teach them to do things that was not intended for them by the "Vision"  afterall, the "Vision" never said that enchanters are traffic controllers.  We know this because the "Vision" is still a mystical beast that is 1000 times harder to find then Veeshan herself.  They are just using the spells the way that was not originally inteneded.  It wasnt intended to be used as a traffic controlling spell just like Feign Death wasnt ment to be used as a pulling technique.  so, now that I've learned that the "Vision" did not intend for me to control traffic, I'll have to take lessons from the friendly shammy on how to waste my mana on buffs so i'll be oom during the fight.  This way i can sit next to the oom wizzy and med through a few fights without aggro.  the difference is that I'll still be invited to raids because I have speed buff and clarity2.  the wizzy is only a taxi and he can be replaced because we only need 1 of them for the entire raid.<P>Well if you've read this far, i know you are not from Verant.  So if you intend to post in this thread please remeber that the problem with "balance" is that we do not know what the "Vision" intend for us.  not because of a few silly buffs or illusions.  Not even the enchant weapon/armor spells or some silly concepts of taunt and factions.  those are part of the game and we are smart enough to work with them.  The reason that there will never be balance is that the "Vision" is not known, not even to the game designers or producers.  it's like trying to run a large corporation without a mission statement.  It's not possible because you are constantly being pulled all different directions.  You cant make 250,000 people aggree on one thing without some kind of structure that everyone knows and understands.  So, please understand this before you post that there is no balance because balance has not been defined by the "Vision" yet.  it does not have anything to do with lack of ideas.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You guys are not seriously thinking about putting in Rune Shield the way it is are you?  2 Peridots, a 10 minute recast time, 350 mana, for only 1000 HPs?  OMG!  Verant has gone insane.  NO ENCHANTERS IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD WASTE MONEY ON THIS SPELL LET ALONE SPEND THE MINUTE OR SO TO SCRIBE IT INTO THEIR BOOK.  What a complete waste of effort on your part Verant.<P>All we asked was that you lower the cost of the gem on Rune 4 and this is what we get?  You guys are out of your minds.  Rune V is a 700 point HP shield.  Casting two of those would be 1400 HPs  which still would take 2 Peridots but give us 400 more HPs and we would not have to dedicate a spell slot to it.  So what if Rune Shield only has a 1 sec cast time.  Do you know how long 1000 HP would last an enchanter in the level of encounters at the level we get this spell?  About 2 secs.  Not even enough time to cast a gate spell.  Ahh, but we will not have room for a gate spell to be memorized because we are dedicating a spot to Rune Shield.  Plus you can still get spells interrupted while Rune is up so gate would probably be irrelavent anyways.  You guys are screwed in the head if you think Enchanters are even going to waste money on this.  Looks like another Sentinal spell (i.e., waste of time and money).<P>Just reduce the cost of the Gem on Rune 4 and forget about Rune Shield and Enchanters everywhere will be happy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Don't know if others have mentioned this yet, but here is some thing that Verant can do for enchanters:<P>1.  Reduce the cast time on POG robe and take out reagent requirement.<BR>2.  Take out recast time on Visions of Grandeur<BR>3.  Give enchanter something that can stack with shaman slow debuff.<BR>4.  Give enchanter a RED message if mob can't be mezed.  A level 60 enchanter sure has hard time to find out which mob is above 53 and can't be mezed with dazzle, or above 55 which cant be mezed with rapture.  Give enchanter a message instead of just eating mana; Rapture takes tons of mana!<BR>5.  Same with stun.  If mob can't be stunned, give enchanter a warning, instead of taking mana and then let mob beat them to death cuz mob can't be stunned.  REMEMBER LEVEL 51 - 59 MOBS ARE ALL BLUE T LEVEL 60!<BR>6.  Same with Dictate!<BR>7.  Same with mana sieve, if mob doesn't have mana, do tell!<BR>8.  Reduce cast time on Magi Shielding.  It doesn't give HP when cast like cleric buffs, what's the point of taking so long to cast it?  Give it 6 seconds or less instead of good long 12 seconds?<BR>9.  Enhance weakness and Cripple spells.  They are totally useless on mobs.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well we talk about wanting to reduce the aggro created by our casting of a spell.

</FONT><HR>I know you guys don't discuss test spells until live. But I had to comment before you do extensive tuning on this spell. You can avoid commenting but please pass on to the appropriate people.<P>The new "Rune Shield" Spell on test.<BR>(To compensate for agro complaints in this thread?)<P>1. It's meant to be cast under melee pressure. It uses reagents. 2 peridots. That's 21pp. When a reagent based spell is interrupted I beleive you LOSE the reagents. So when a cleric casts his reagent free DA 3x before it goes off...we cast our version 3x and it costs us 63pp.<P>2. This spell is like healing yourself in battle it adds to agro a little. Actually I hear rune agro is higher then healing agro from those that use it like a heal.<P>3. Rune V is like 750hp...this is 1000hp I doubt they stack. This is twice as expensive, self-only, and has a 10 minute recast. I'm not sure 250hp at level 55 is worth all those con's. I mean that's what? 1 second on mobs my level?<BR>A) Spell slots is another peeve of ours. Especially the "Always mem" spells with long recasts where swapping is not possible.<BR>B) Reagent cost is a pet peeve of ours.<P>What would I do?<BR>1. Fix level 55 spell "memory flux", make it work like a good jolt. Erase part of MY hate not other peoples. It should be better then jolt (fast, cheap, and actually not be resisted (note new spell cinder jolt on test, because MR is always so high)...this is OUR area of expertise. <P>Memory altering is the playground of the enchanter, not wizard, not ranger, not rogue...atleast make us as good as they are.<P>2. Lower the agro of tash series to be in line with malo. Malo is unresistable (level 60) and lowers 3 stats about as much as we lower one. Shamans have more AC/HP. I don't understand the logic...why is ours like 30x the taunt value of malo again?<P>3. Change the PoG robe to either <BR>A) Rune V w/reagent<BR>B) This new spell "Rune Shield" with 1 peridot cost and a lasting effect like the donals nerf that is 10mins. Be it mana regen, minor Int DEBUFF..<BR>C) Rune III or IV w/o Reagent.<P>Side note: Compare cleric DA spell to our spell.<P>Enchanter<BR>Level 55<BR>21 reagent per cast ATTEMPT (multiple attempts needed)<BR>1-18 second immune to one mob. (avg duration on my level mob 2-3 seconds)<P>Cleric<BR>Level 1<BR>No cost<BR>18 sec invulnerability to all mobs attacking me no matter what level.<P>Obviously clerics are FAR superior when you compare a level 1 to a level 55 spell heh.<P>I will bring up one point clerics can not melee or cast while DA. BUT the enchanter is unlikely to cast while under attack either, even if runed. And if you see him melee...shoot him.<P>I'm not trying to convince you to upgrade the spell. I'm trying to tell you to scrap it and look for other solutions. I don't think your looking for the solution in the right direction.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I heartily agree with the sentiment that the epic quest should NOT result in another melee buff. At that level we are finding it more and more difficult to do more than be buffers. It is a bit foolish to give a melee buf to a class THAT DOES NOT MELEE. How about the illusions we have requested for so long. Mirror illusion, NPC illusion, or perhaps an upgrade to ae mez that lasts as long as our individual mez and is unresistable.<P>as for rune shield...hahahahahahahaah...oops sorry, I casted humor resist debuf on myself by accident.

Enchanters already have WAY too many lines of spells to mem a spell that could only by used once per day or any other significant length of time.

</FONT><HR>two things to note once again:<P>Adding illusions will not solve anything, unless they say..gave the base stats of that race.  Wolf form adds a little sow and they are all castable on others.  Otherwise forget it.<P>Mes should be able to overwrite another mes.  This becomes espically important at the 45+ level's when there are more than one enchanter in a raid party - and is complicated even more if one enchanter is higher level than another.<BR>A good example is in velious.  The high level enchanter manages to mes two things, but casts tash on a third and gets killed.  Now the low level enchanter is left with two mes'd creatures, and cant remes them, nor can he re-cast any buffs on anyone in the group until they are completely gone.<BR>Its a royal pain.<P>In short, take a look a the overwriting of enchanter spells.  Specifically the mes line.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I just had an inspiration of sorts.  What if our Color line of stuns had a built-in memory blur effect.  Perhaps self-only.  This could eliminate the need for a personal memory blur shield or other such devices.  The cast time on our stuns isn't too bad and often having a Rune spell up makes it possible to get one off.  What do people think?   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The only way anyone will ever buy the rune shield spell is if it has a memory blur effect build into it... ie as you get hit they forget about you or when you cast it the first time it also acts like evade.  But this will not happen... *shrug* most people will not give up a slot for it.  But i must aggree a colourflux spell that does memory blur is a good idea.  Have already suggested that but looks like we got Rune shield instead.<P>Instead of giving use ruin shield why not give the higher end rune spells a build in memory blur effect.  Ie. as they hit you it reduces aggro on you.  A spell like that i would waste a 10 plat gem on.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057513-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057513-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057513-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057513&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057513&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
