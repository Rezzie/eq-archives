</FONT><HR>Ya know lately i have had a problem with a lot of people having a problem paying for RES.  It seems people are willing to pay out there wazoo for a TP and that takes away from a Druid or Wizards time.  if offering me clarity is a payment of somekind then *** are druids doing right that clerics arent.  next time you dont wanna pay for a RES then dont ask when you hear the price.  You want a clerics time you pay or eat the EXP loss get off our backs about paying or offering our mana back F*** that pay me!<P><BR>Scirradoo 53 Vicar terris Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just to let you know, regardless of what you think, unlike clerics, most druids never even ask for (nor are they offered) payment for their services. It is a VERY SMALL subset of druids that goes around auctioning ports and sow.<P>Get off your high horse, the groups let you keep all the gems already, geez, how much more do you want?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You'd be surprised how few wizards charge for rides too. The people that charge are the one who do it for a living, IE. they do nothing else with that character all day long. Then they use the cash to twink up their alternates.<P>Most wizzy/druids that play as those characters won't charge you. Unless your a demanding little !@%!@ that makes a nuisance out of yourself, then I will most likely give some outrageous price just to get you off my back. And if you pay it kudo's to me.<P>Anytime I ask for a rezz, rarely since I'm usually grouped with a cleric, I respect peoples time and do not ask more than once. If I get no response I assume they are busy and do not bother them again.<P>You aren't the only cleric in the world ya know :P.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I never specify a amt required for a tp.  its always what they offer.  They send a shout for 100pp for a tp i'll tp.  They offer 30 i'll tp.  They just say wtb tp i will do tp, but won't ask for money.<P>I only get offended when they offer a certain amt of pp for tp, then ask how much he owes me.  Then i say what ever you want to donate.  And decide its now free?  I get annoyed.  Esp if their higher than lvl 35.  <P>I just think cheap.  I always offer clerics 100pp for rezzes assumeing i can find one.

</FONT><HR>Actually had kind of the opposite problem the other day, got a port to BB, and the duid was taking another fellow to WC first. He was asking 10pp, but I was broke and had rougly 7pp and some oddball loot on me, and he said 5pp was fine. When we get to WC, the other guy stiffs him, I sell my loot, and find I now have 8plat to my name.  We get to BB and I give him the 8, and he refuses it.  I offer it again, saying "we agreed on 5, and the other guy didnt pay" he says no, and I offer him the 5, he decides to not take that either. Now, may sound odd, but I don't feel right not paying for a port, I mean, its someones time and mana, and that can be a pain.  <P>Anyhoo, thanks again Sibban, and one day, even after you've forgotten, I'll make sure you get the money.<P>Aeor.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I don't mind making a donation. But the attitude that you are SELLING a res rather than OFFERING it is the clincher.<P>If you port me, I'll drop some plat in a trade window. But if you start haggling with me "No, I want 15" well then I just say forget it and find someone else.<P>I don't like people who sell class powers as a service. Do it as a public service and people will make donations to you.<P>If anybody needs anything summoned, food, bandages, arrows, whatever. It's free. I do it because I'm there to help. If I'm too busy, I'm too busy. If you want to drop me a couple plat for those summoned daggers, fine but it really isn't required.<P>Same with all my other characters. If I'm porting then I'll offer people a ride. If they feel like tipping, that's fine.<P>But a CLERIC charging for RES??? That's friggin retarded. If you're gonna sit there and haggle with me over something that you GET simply by virtue of PLAYING A CLASS, then I don't want a rez from you, nor do I want you in my group.<P>I mean if the only reason you play your class is because of what powers it gets, then you suck ass. Alot of people start twinky clerics because it's easy to get a group and there's a ton of money in it (despite the cost of peridots.) Those people I would rather not associate with. I don't need you, I don't need your rez, and you're not welcome in my group.<P>The best clerics are the ones who started a cleric because it was INTERESTING to them. They wanted to HELP PEOPLE, HEAL PEOPLE, REZ PEOPLE.<P>Alot of people think I started my Mage just because he could solo. BZZZT. WRONG.<P>I started my Mage not knowing anything about the game. I didn't know anything about solo, money, powers, etc. I chose the class because IT WAS INTERESTING TO ME.<P>But then some months pass by, and there's some LOW DOWN SCUM BUCKET sitting there ripping newbies off trying to sell them SUMMONED WEAPONS and generally giving Mages (myself included) a "dood" image.<P>Same with Druids. You think MOST people started druids thinking "Great, now I can quad kite"????<P>You know why the vast majority of Druids started Druids? Because they found the class INTERESTING. Because they watch alot of DISCOVERY CHANNEL AND LIKE ANIMALS.<P>Months passed by, and suddenly you have a TON of druids coming in figuring "Great, now I can quad kite and port people around for money."<P>And that's why Druids today have a reputation of being a bunch of "DOODS" when that's not truly the case.<P>I believe Clerics are the next "dood" class. Over the coming months we're going to be seeing alot of clerics coming out of the wood work to sell rezzes and have groups at their beckon call.<P>Scirradoo 53 Vicar terris Thule, just happens to be the first of the doods to crawl out from under the rocks.<P>Love,<BR>Dad.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Being a cleric can be hideiously expensive. And most folks dont think twice about asking for a peridot and a pearl buff. Folks thats over 100plat per group per buff!! A good group will give you some gems up front **if** they loot some. But it is always an if and not all groups will.<P>The other day I was asked to help in a epic battle. It was not for me or anything I wanted. I got no xp, no loot, and spent 27 peridots and several hours of my time with not even an offer of replacement for the gems. <P>So when you come up to a cleric and without so much as a "please" demand a heal, buff, or Rez, and then he has the "nerve" to ask you to supply your own gems please dont get your panties in a wad. If its not worth the price of a Peridot to you why should he donate one?<P>The folk I really appreciate are the ones who understand our class. They usually will have a supply of gems with them just for rezs. I can't remember ever turning one of them down. Even better when I do a REZ for one of them they pay me a few Peridots.

Simple as that. <P>I don't charge for TPs myself, but whenever I need a rez, I am more than willing to pay for it. If someone isn't then they don't need the rez that bad, do they?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As a druid, I get pestered a lot for ports.  If I'm not busy, or if I'm going that way anyways, I always offer to port people.  I never ask a fee up-front, and when asked "how much?" I just /shrug.<P>But there are two cases that really piss me off..<P>1) Portbeggar shouts "WTB TP to &lt;zone&gt;."  I meet Portbeggar, group, teleport to &lt;zone&gt;, and Portbeggar says "thx," disbands, and runs off.<P>What the hell happened to the "WTB" part?  If you're looking to stiff someone for a port, be up front about it and beg like a n00b.  Don't say you're going to pay, and then stiff me.<P>2) Portbeggar shouts "Need a TP to &lt;zone&gt;."  I'm at the druid rings picking up a friend going that way anyhow, so I send a tell, saying "I will take you, come to the druid rings.  Leaving in a few minutes."<P>10 minutes pass.  Friend is /tapping his foot.  /tell Portbeggar Where are you?<P>Portbeggar tells you, "On my way in a minute, my group is almost done here."<P>You begin casting Circle of &lt;zone&gt;.<P>Five minutes later.....<P>Portbeggar tells you, "Hey!  Where did you go?  You didn't port me!  You suck! I'm going to petition you!"<P>All I can say is KISS MY ASS.  It's not my job to wait around while you waste my time.  If you're getting a port, get your ass to the druid ring PRONTO.  Not after the next spawn, or the next kill, or after you run to the bank, or after you sell.  NOW.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>I'll tell you the difference.  Its simple.<P>When I look for a teleport, i'll have 10pp in my pocket and toss it over to the druid almost without asking.  I've never seen a druid or wizard say "I know you really want this teleport, so its gonna be 100pp this time."<P>When I need a res, I just ask if any clerics are willing to res me, because if a cleric responds who expects money, they're going to want something like 300pp, which I don't even carry around with me.  I usually give them the 50 or so pp I have on me.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058237-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058237-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058237-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=058237&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=058237&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
