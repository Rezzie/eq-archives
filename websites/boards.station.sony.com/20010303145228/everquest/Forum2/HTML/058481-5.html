</FONT><HR>That's all fine and dandy, but druids finally get quest armor and it takes an uber guild to do it?  From what I am reading not even FoH has a complete set of druid quest armor?<P>Varient must really hate druids.  We get a screwed epic quest, noone wants druids on a vs raid since we are useless, but we need that stone like rangers do.  Fay is an idiot to go and get killed by the iskar master.  He should be a triggered mob like the general for rogue epics.<P>Oh, look at them quad kiting and soloing all the time, lets nerf them some more.  It cause we can't get in groups all the time, and quad kiting is a result of you all nerfing DoTs.  Just undo the nerf and folks will go back to snare/dot kiting again.  It much safer and more efficient.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Without registering one way or the other on whether PoG stuff should/should, if one is to believe that the PoG armor is there to provide the non-uber, non-elite players a chance to get [EXPLETIVE] armor, wouldn't this imply that druids, paladins, and rangers ought to be able to get [EXPLETIVE] armor from doing VERY simple (one part, effectively) quests?<P>The only explanation I can think of is that<P>a) Verant just has it in for those three classes (not for good types in general, mind you, just those three classes - Karana druids, Erollisi Marr pallies, and Karana rangers can all kill in plane without worrying about faction, but there's STILL no armor drops for them).<P>b)  They screwed up balancing the risk/reward ratio for killing in the planes/getting ph4t l3wtz from drops.<P>I know which theory I believe is more likely, what about the rest of you?<BR><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]

</FONT><HR>I think it's obvious that EQ was produced by a committee... in which each department designed a zone/class/quest without ever consulting any other dependant/impacted/affected department...<P>Verants idea of a "fix" seems to equal a "nerf".  IMO they would rather nerf PoG (which was only brought up as an example in the original post) than fix the quest items/rates/drops, that need to be reexamined for risk vs reward (what is Verants idea of "risk vs reward", anyway?).<P>I am finding that as I grow, within EQ, that the quests, while fun are not at all balanced.  The joy in questing for a unique piece of armor - when the armor I'm wearing "randomly dropped (non-PoG stuff)" is better than the quested armor/weapon... I wonder why?<P>Nerf the nerfs!  Balance the Quests!  AND test them first!<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Thank you<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

And not returning because her nerf claims were attacked by most that have posted in this thread, is hardly "mature."<P>Look up the definition of "anger."

Giving up on trying to educate a child (YOU) would demonstrate I'm the better man?  Glad I won't ever qualify for your stunted model.<P>How am I not keeping my word?

But the drop rates are woefully low considering that the MOB's are not droping the actual completed piece of armor like MOB's in PoG do.

Don't misunderstand me we aren't a roleplaying guild, but at least some basis.<P>No what is left for a medium size guild ?<BR>Quest armor of course !<P>So we did Thurgadim quest and Skyshrine Quest.<BR>Doing Skyshrine quest we have a good idea of what can be Kael's quest too since they involved a part of ToV.<P>We killed in Kael, Hall of test, Siren's Grotto, Velketor and so on...<P>Conclusion : nothing to add to Furor's comments, he is perfectly right.<P>Guilds or Alliances that do quests don't ask to nerf PoG. We don't want to see your DisneyLand park touched don't panic.<P>We started armour quest more than a month ago. I couldn't tell you the amount of time involved.<BR>How many Cr, buffing session in TOV...<BR>To give you an idea just imagine farming PoG every day since 4 weeks and still no BP, one pair of legs.<P>Funny part is that we have have enough to finish around 18 kind of leggings (around 200 gems in stock) but killing in ToV requiers more efforts than a Trakanon's raid, and Kael's camping is one of the most boring that exists regarding the drop rate.<P>Breastplate ?<BR>We have 4 of them unfinished, only 2 Flawless diamonds, 2 Black marble and 2 Pristine emerald.<P>Should i add that the look you get for Thurgadim armor is exactly the same than the low level armor you get with Guardian armor. And i pity the rangers, druids and shaman that get exactly the same armor look than Ry'Gor armor in Eastern West.<BR>If you do Kael or Skyshrine you get colored armor and many of them of bad taste.<P>Pride to wear quest armor ?<BR>No.<P>Where Kurnak was a good expansion, fairly well test and balanced, Velious is a quick made product.<P>I won't comment today's patch about aggro list...<P>Sabel<BR>Almageste <BR>Karana Server<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I still would not CAMP there for my armor.

I stated that others attacked her "claims".  You focused on the fact that I'm the only one that took her to task for her foolish arrogance (which was also inaccurate [see Wall_Eye 2/19 at 9:36 am and Goladus 2/18 at 11:52 am]).  Reread the thread.  Posts by Sancho, Strom, Zacheus, nillon, Ziann, Big_Kahuna, Dalakar, just on pages 2 and 3, all disagreed with the "Nerf PoG" claims of Millie and company.<P>In the process of cataloging all this for you, I reread Millie's last post and my response.  She never returned after I pointed out the fallacy in her "you're just a farmer" allegation.  Failing to apologize or admit her error is a sign of a lack of maturity.<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Khadgar/Gelaen:  Whatever guys.  nuguk keeps bringing up Millie's actions, and I'm just demonstrating his errors.<P>Khadgar:  No error?  What about how she said she wasn't going to infer that because I was arguing against PoG being nerfed I must be a PoG farmer, even though she'd already made that assertion?  It's in the very last post she made, and I pointed out her hypocrisy in my subsequent post.  She never returned.<P>In any event, my quote from Furor was about the fact that he did not agree with her demand that PoG be nerfed, contrary to nuguk's assertion.  My deduction that Furor asked her to stay out of the thread due to her inflammatory comments, is based simply on the evidence, her lack of return, and Furor's past conduct in controlling his minions.<P>And your definition of "long before" is intriguing.  Furor's post to "lay off the flames" was the next day after Millies last post and not even a page and a half away.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif"><P>Gelaen:  There's nothing to "get over."  nuguk keeps trying to defend Millie for some unfathomable reason, and I am enjoying eviscerating his efforts.  It's amusing.<P>I've admitted to being wrong plenty of times.  I used to play on TZ, and posted in some of the threads with that annoying FREE RALLOS theme.  I'd made some erroneous assumptions in those threads based upon TZ and not knowing of other changes to PvP since I'd quit the horribly broken Zeks.  When those errors were pointed out to me, I admitted my error.  I did the same to nuguk when I'd missed the one sentence where Millie addressed the quest armours in her Nerf PoG campaign.<P>It's fine to make claims that I've never done something, especially when you have no idea what you are talking about.  If you'd like to point to some other alleged error, I'd be happy to examine it to determine whether you are correct.  Until then, you're just pulling stuff out of your ass.  Perhaps you ought to go see the same proctologist as nuguk?<P>The denser people stopped responding to me?  Hmmmm, that makes you . . . even more dense and wrong?   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/tongue.gif">  A couple folks in this thread have directly, positively responded to my comments.  Others have agreed with different elements:  Millie's arrogance, Furor's error regarding "unneeded changes," nuguk's failure to recognize the nose on his face, etc.<P>Sure, a flame isn't going to cure the arrogance of FoH.

</FONT><HR>Khadgar:  As I've said, I refuse to leave lies and errors alone.  She posted her 100 line rant, I posted a brief rebuttal and left it at that.  It was nuguk that decided to keep resurrecting Millie's rants.  It was Millie that decided to post erroneous information and flat-out lie about her "PoG farmer" accusation, and then not return.  I chose not to let those lies remain unchallenged and uncorrected.  I was happy to let it die at that point, but nuguk and you keep bringing it up.  Who is the one that's supposed to be so blindedly focused on Millie?  That would appear to be nuguk and you.<P>To turn your own phrase back on you (one of my favorite things):  I've never seen a virtual woman able to keep a guy so enamored of her this long after she posted.<P>On the "long before" issue.  As I said, my deduction addressed what was said by Furor and his prior statements.  She's in his guild.  He's got her email.  He could've sent her an email to tell her to cork it.<P>Your analogy regarding JFK and the Declaration of Independence is flawed.  Exageration to the degree you have is hardly conducive to such analogies and debate.  See, JFK and the DoI have nothing to do with each other.  Furor said to cork it, and Millie did.

</FONT><HR>As I see it. Some take faction hits for the PoG armor. This leaves the quests to accomplish their endeavors of something equal without ruining faction. Getting to some planes is very difficult to begin with. Why shouldn't the quest armor not be about as difficult?<BR>It seems to me that in the long run it balances out and the same amount of effort to acquire the armor is about the same. After all, will you win the roll everytime for the armor in the planes? And how many peeps do you have there raiding it? No. And neither should the quest armor be something that should just be handed over either. So in turn the work is the same. Just a bit more leg work on lesser mobs to acquire. Let it be. Verant has done the right thing. A person should have to work their butt off for something rather than handed to them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

There's no error in causality."<P>No, he did not. Millie said she was done responding to you, then she left. Then you responded. Then some more people talked about whatever the hell this thread is supposed to be about. Then Furor posted, saying he is indifferent to whether the zone gets nerfed or upgraded or what have you, so long as quest armor is improved. Nowhere in Furor's post did I see any sort of directive issued to Millie. Nowhere in his post did he even address Millie. He simply called in general for people to shut up and stop the flames. You being the prime instigator of arguments and flames on this thread, he meant you as much as he meant anyone else. Furthermore, and I hate to keep having to re-state this, MILLIE HAD LEFT BEFORE FUROR SAID ANYTHING about flames and whatnot. There is NO causality between his post and her departure. GET IT THROUGH YOUR SKULL, which I admit from its thickness must give you quite a high Armor Class.<P>Do you have any PROOF that Furor sent Millie an e-mail? No, you don't. You're making an assumption. And you're passing your wild assumption off as fact in several of your diatribes. Even Thogg could figure out how thin of a limb you're going out on here.<P>In short, I don't care who is right. I don't care if Millie is Satan incarnate. She could be, for all I know, and it wouldn't bother me. My quarrel is with YOU and your apparent failure to leave well enough alone. More than a few people have asked you to kindly stow it.

</FONT><HR>"I never stated it as FACT. I said it was a deduction based upon the evidence."<P>What evidence?!? WHERE is your evidence that Furor might have e-mailed Millie about this? There IS none. It's called baseless conjecture. Your various claims start out adamant and, when corrected in such a manner, slowly begin to sink into silliness. At that point in time you gradually realize they no longer hold water and trivialize them as if to avoid looking like a fool. Case in point: your claim that Millie was only calling for nerfs. You were blown out of the water on that one. And now this. You mixed up your timelines on when millie left the thread and when Furor posted. You're wrong. And clearly you won't admit it.<P>Your claim is even more ludicrous, considering that Furor never espoused anything but indifference toward Millie's posts. If I remember correctly, that one post of Furor's to which you retreat time and again stated that Furor DID NOT CARE what happened to PoG; he just wanted to see people stay on topic. The general populace he was addressing could just as easily mean you as it might have meant her. Are you honestly that stupid, or just stubborn and unable to let your pride abide by a correction of your ridiculous assumptions?<P>Millie's post was ON TOPIC, even if to you it seemed "arrogant and elitist." You're the one who struck the first blow and took it to a personal level by making a post entirely off-topic, whose sole purpose was to criticize Millie's attitude. From that moment on, this thread degenerated into a flame war of your initiation. I'll say it again.

</FONT><HR>Khadgar:  Blown out of the water?   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/confused.gif">  Uh, no.  Her one line concurrence with Furor on the quest armour is hardly contrary to my statement that she was screaming for nerfs.  No, I didn't mix up my timelines.  Despite your tortured reading, Furor's post before Millie's last rant (almost sounds like a movie, "Millie's Last Rant") would have sounded foolish.  Whatever.  As I said, believe what you'd like.<P>I have no doubt that Furor was addressing me as well as Millie and the others that were getting off Furor's quest armour topic.  Never said anything else.  Yes, he was indifferent to the PoG nerf claim, but not to the level of invective coming from Millie.  And why should I not go to Furor's own words, since that is the topic at hand?  He hasn't exactly made a lot.  <P>Time and time again?  Uh, no.  I cited his 8:28 a.m. post once.  You are the one that keeps bringing it up.  And how can Millie's post calling for nerfs of PoG be ON TOPIC (to quote you), if Furor stated it wasn't.  Millie raised PoG nerfing, not Furor.  Therefore, not on topic.  Millie's first line "Hell, why NOT nerf PoG as well?"  Doesn't sound ON TOPIC to me.<P>You can't stand me.  Oooo, I'm hurt.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif">  You really should seek counselling if something someone writes on a Message Board becomes so important to you.<P>I'm not being attacked?  Wow!  I hate to see it if you ever did attack someone on a BBS.  Probably a lot of words that would get bleeped from here.<P>So I struck the first blow?  Wow!  Did you read Millie's first two posts before I ever responded to her?  She calls anyone that goes to PoG a gimp, a complete moron, selfish, with "no friggin clue" how to play the game.  Wanna try again?  I didn't call Millie "arrogant and elitist", just the crap she was spewing.  You understand the difference between these statements, right?<P>1.  You have said something very foolish.<BR>2.  You are very foolish.<P>The first is permissible in general debate and under the Rules of Conduct.  The second is not permissible.  I did the first one to Millie.  She did the second to me and a whole bunch of other folks.<P>You really amuse me.  You talk about trying to act all mature, and then conclude with "Grow up.  PLEASE."  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/rolleyes.gif">  That is fricking, outrageously funny.<P>Later.  I'm done working and time to go play with my kids and then EQ when they go to bed.  I'll check in with you tomorrow and see what new silly things you can say.  It's been a tough week, so your comments are a good way to amuse me.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wheres Furor at?<P>Has anyone tried going into PoM and see if any class armor drops in there? If so, Id just give up on the city based quests. The quest armor is almost identical to PoG armor, just a few stats swapped around. I really doubt Verant will make the drops on this stuff more frequent. Infact as I understand it, they nerfed the gem drops once already, just as they nerfed PoG drops too. <P>Its sad that they cant understand what really motivates a player to keep playing. When there is no reward for putting in tons of effort, everyone just gives up...or they come to these boards and hope for the best. Usually they just give up though.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
