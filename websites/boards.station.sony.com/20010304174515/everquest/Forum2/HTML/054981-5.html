</FONT><HR>Hail again everyone.<P>I don't know if other clerics are feeling the same way I do but this is how it is with me. I've had a blast playing my cleric all the way to 51. I used to think hell he's my first toon and I care about him greatly but now it seems I've been wasting my time playing him(60+ played days).<P>With all the nice things that have been done to enhance hybrids Im thinking about stoping my cleric where he is now(rezzing machine). I mean there is no more point to me playing...less maybe I get to lvl 56 and get that nice rez(better rezzing machine) after that who needs me. There are tons of rezzing machines out there but I've almost completly lost the luster I once thought I had being a(exuse the pun)"Supperior" healer. Maybe we can technically heal better...its not that I don't enjoy saving someones life at the last seccond..or rezzing someones lost level back.<P>Just seems that if soo many other classes are like us in a bunch of different ways theres no point to me playing any more for enjoyment.<P>I like the idea of a group port to our temple. A temple that is put in each city town depending on diety\race. Yes a group port not a self only..tho that would suffice me too. I dunno I know cleric talks are probobly over..but now I have more ideas(after talking with friends who came back from the faire[took pics of absor and "Nerf"Ashi(gordon).]<P>I hope you guys can see there is something wrong here. Please think about it more before giving our abilities to all these other classes. Id like to think im special.<P>-Daeksun Quillmane-<BR>51 Vicar - The Rathe<BR>...OSS...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Man I have heard alot of winey people but you cleric take it. Honely GEE stop complaining. Cleric are sure not the greatest class when you start out, but once you hit 30, I would rather have a cleric healing there a druid or shaman. (Cleric usual have high Wis compaired to shaman who only have Troll, Bar, Orges and iskars). I am a 50 plus shaman and believe me I would rather be blasting and doting then healing, that what cleric are for, yes give us Sup Heal at 51 i think is a good idea because, hell G heal suck once you go past 45, it take to much mana to cast to heal warrior etc etc, sup heal would help us, but not to take the place of a cleric. Believe me Cleric are alway first rate healer, druid and sham are back up ONLY. When I got on a Dragon Raid I am not a healer, I blast and debuff, and cleric do the healing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, you do not understand the argument why these changes to druids and shamans make clerics undesirable.  It is NOT that clerics will no longer be the best healers.  The problem is that the margin by which clerics are the better healers is not enough to compensate for the tremendous versatility that clerics give up compared to the other priests!  None of your posts address this argument. instead you just keep paroting that clerics will still be better healers.  I challenge you to compare the spell lists and still say that clerics are just as desirable to play as shamans and clerics.  SO now a shaman can heal as well as a cleric.  &lt;sarcasm&gt;Well 2 clerics cannot slow as well as a shaman. 2 clerics can not port as well as a druid. 2 clerics cannot DS as well as a druid.  2 clerics cannot SoW as well as a druid.  2 clerics cannot DoT as well as a druid. 2 clerics cannot invis as well as a druid. 2 clerics cannot ... do anything better than a druid except heal a LITTLE better.<BR>&lt;/sarcasm&gt;<P>THINK ABOUT IT!   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>How about lowering the casting difficulty of divine light, or as all the clerics I know refer to it: divine fizzle.  I've fizzled 3 times in a row on numerous occasions.  That's a bit much for a master of healing if you ask me.<P>As far as giving more healing to druids and shamans, it definitely changes the playing field.  Especially with shamans.  Once you slow an NPC, superior healing is sufficient in many places.  Of course, you still need a cleric because hunting post 50 without a rez capable cleric is madness.  One link death and you are set back hours.  I don't see this changing my life as a cleric very much: sit, sit, sit, sit, stand, CH, sit.... <P>I know everyone has complained about the tediousness of the cleric's life but, to be honest, it's a hard problem to fix.  A cleric must sit to med.  The only way that's not going to happen is if his mana recharge is the same (or nearly the same) standing as when sitting.  A spell that did that would drastically change our lives and make it much more interesting.  The problem is: 1) anything short of this won't make much difference and 2) this will never happen.  <P>Why won't it happen?  Because if it did every other class would be screaming for the same thing and I think VI would consider it too radical a change.  There are also other problems.<P>Would it affect balance?  I think so.  With jboots a cleric could run around and kite stuff with basically endless mana.  You don't see that now.  And with mana regenning like he was sitting, it would change the pace of kiting, making it much more rewarding experience wise.  Making it indoor only would deal with this but there are other issues as well, and many I haven't thought of I'm sure.<P>Another idea would be a weapon that proc'd something like "mana gift," a spell that would instantly grant X mana with no health loss.  So, on average, you could melee and get almost as much mana as medding.  Of course, there are lots of issues with this... is the weapon tuned to provide the amount of mana from medding at level 60 or level 30?  Can you make a weapon proc scale appropriately with level?  Does this overpower the cleric class?  Would this weapon be so insanely difficult to get that it made absolutely no difference to 90%+ clerics?  Would clerics with this weapon be given preference over those without based simply upon them having this item?  This seems to be perfectly acceptable for warriors... i.e. you pick warriors based on equipment routinely.  A warrior with good equipment is good, a warrior with great equipment is great, a naked warrior is basically worthless.  This seems to be a "no-no" for priests and casters...  A cleric with 200+ wisdom, unless you are going on a raid, is pretty much interchangeable with any other cleric with 200+ wisdom.  The same goes for pure casters.  I don't understand VI's "vision" here but they seem to be very unwilling to change so I'll pick another battle.<P>In short, I haven't seen any solution to date that doesn't violate balance issues or VI's "vision" of the game.  Clerics were tedious and necessary then.  They are tedious and necessary now.  And they will be tedious and necessary hereafter.  You can usually find a group but you'll be almost as bored as if you didn't.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Wow I cannot believe the things I am seeing said here. Some clerics here seem to not know what a good thing for the game really is. <P>The way it is right now, in many many instances, if you do not have a cleric, you do not have a group. If you have a cleric in your group, and he needs to log out, your group ends if you cannot find another cleric immediately. If you are doing crazy things such as single group juggie raids, you cannot do it without a cleric. You are kinda crazy going to charasis without a cleric. You just cant do a lot of things without a cleric. Clerics currently have the ability to determine whether a group will exist or not for certain purposes. The upgrades to the shaman/druid healing is going to allow those that cannot find a cleric to actually still be able to have a chance at doing the things they want to do. This will not make a cleric obsolete in any way. A cleric will still be the hands down best healer there is. What it will allow to happen is for groups that cannot get a cleric to at least cope with that fact and still be able to function, rather than they just cannot make the group. <P>You know what the number one reason is that friends and I will cancel groups to places? Thats right. "Damn, can't find a cleric  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">" I will always 100% of the time prefer a cleric for group over a second shaman or druid, but at least if this makes it live it will give us some options. It will still take two shamans or druids to be able to come close to being able to heal half as well as a cleric, and even then only in normal single group non uber type mob sorts of camps. The cleric will never be replaced. <P>For those that might say something like "In a well balanced group a cleric can keep tanks healed with remedy only" they should stop and think what a balanced group currently consists of. Now think of the group that many of us wind up in on a regular basis (read as not ideal or unbalanced) and you just cannot do it without the cleric. <P>Anyhow, this will be a positive change all around since the only clerics that have trouble finding a group (at high level at least since this is the only part of the game affected by this) are the clerics that really just aren't any good at their job. I have met quite a few of those and won't group with them again. <P>Aktunka Wormflinger<BR>Lvl 56 Troll Shaman<BR>Drinal<P>PS I think they need to look very closely at all classes fizzle rates for post 50 spells. Nothing sucks more than trying to fire off a superior heal and have it fizzle 6 times in a row with maxxed specialization in alteration and 202 wisdom. That just really stinks and wastes over a bubble of mana. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OK, first off let me start by saying that I'm a shaman.  I've probably only gone solo a total of 7 levels since I was "born" on Tallon Zek well over a year ago.<P>I only started reading this thread because I wanted to see what other classes were complaining about as maybe it would allow me to see how or why some complaints were addressed and others were not.  I'm not coming in here to crash the verant bashing party. Nor do I feel as personally attacked as many of my shaman brothers and sisters.<P>I'm going to address many of the things that I've read up till now with hopes that maybe everybody can get on the same page.  <P>1.  Just because people have not played your class does not mean that they will not see your point.  It does not mean that they are not capable of coming up with proper understanding.  I see a lot of people on the shaman boards making the same comments regarding how "verant hates us," etc.<P>2.  About 99% of all shaman specialize in alteration just like clerics.  Compare and contrast this with the fact that 90% of all druids specialize in Evocation.  This will come into play in any of this as no matter what heals druids get at high levels, most will be unable to use them on a regular/effective basis.  <P>3.  There has been a lot of class envy between Clerics/Shaman/Druids since the beginning of EQ.  Druids are the jacks of all trades with good nukes, snare, DoTs, heals, track, harmony, ports, buffs, etc.  Clerics do lead a very mundane life on the seat of their pants most of the time, and they are the only priest class to not get any kind of travel buffs.  Shaman get good DoTs (Necros have the best in this regards), extremely mana inefficient nukes (couldn't tell ya the last time I nuked anything), heals, buffs (mostly placebos, but it puts a pretty little icon on the screen), "companions" at 34, and various physical debuffs.  We won't even go into all the debates that took place over the stats of the epics and the various pieces of armor.  <P>3.  Most shaman and druids do not want to be clerics.  Most druids and clerics do not want to be shaman.  Most shaman and clerics do not want to be druids.  Simple rule of thumb.  We all picked our class (a great number of us pre-expansion) with some knowledge of what our roles were going to be.  And if you read the profession lists, you will see that shaman and druids are considered healers.  To enhance their abilities to a degree that they can still function as healers is nothing more than fixing an existing problem.  It was stated by a previous poster that if a shaman or druid sat down and did nothing but heal, that they could still do the job.  I have been the only healer in my group many many times post 50.  I will admit that I have in fact been able to do the job as long as it was not a hard battle.  Sure I can keep up with the damage of a single drolvarg.  But, if we end up with a few mobs, I end up chain healing the warrior as soon as he/she drops two bubbles (or ranger if they drop one bubble) just so that I can somehow keep the group alive.  It isn't a whine, it is simple truth.  When the mob double hits for 150 and the healer only can heal 250 with a heal, bad things happen.<P>4.  Verant has done an obsolutely horrible job of keeping defined roles of many classes.  For example, anything a shaman brings to a group can be duplicated almost as well without them.  This is a major issue that I've read of many different classes.<P>5.  We all want to be wanted and to not be diminished.  We all feel slapped in the face when our class defining abilities are given to others.   I do agree that clerics need some new toys.  I would think that getting some of the undead manipulation spells that necros have would be a great place to start.<P>6.  Remember that pre-expansion that Clerics received no regen type spells whatsoever.  Any and all of the celestial line, and other spells that are not a straight heal are spells that were a new bone that was thrown to Clerics.  These spells in most applications are far superior to the classes (Shaman primarily and druid secondarily) that had these to begin with.  I never heard a huge uproar from either class that clerics "stole" some of our abilities and in fact surpassed us in them.  Though I would be much more happy receiving the celestial line as opposed to 40,000 worthless stat buffs.  It would have been more in line with our prior "vision" and we would not have truly had as much need for superior heal.  Shaman getting all those group buffs and other buffs as a huge percentage of our post 50 spells would be the equal of clerics getting a full 1/3 to 1/2 of their spells being summon hammer spells (situationally it might be handy, but in general, it is worthless).  Now, this isn't a shaman topic, and I'm not wanting to detract from the focus of the topic.<P>7.  No matter how many times it is complained about, Verant truly could care less about class distinction.  They have proven it time and again.  Verant will make any change they feel will help in class balance.  Now, nobody will ever be able to say how this balance can be achieved.  Solo-ability of classes can't be the complete benchmark.  Nobody has the raw solo tools of a necro.  No matter what Verant has done to make Necros more group friendly, they have hardly addressed the issue that necros do not NEED to group and in fact can solo in such a way that a group will give less xp.  Same can be said for druids and their quad kiting.  The problem hasn't been that groups do not want necros and druids, it is that druids and necros do not want groups.  I do know of at least one person of almost every class (no warriors) that has basically solod to 50 (including clerics).  It can be done, but reality is that druids and necros are the solo kings.  Shamans can solo, but most do not do so unless there is no better/funner alternative.  So that basically leaves the function in groups as a measuring stick.  You have to balance some solo power with group power.  I don't think that anybody really believes that a shaman or druid will replace clerics due to these changes. Does making this change somehow diminish the raw healing power of a cleric?  nope.  Would a planes run ever go down without clerics for heals (not talking about rez), nope.  Will this change positively never cause a cleric to sit idle for a few minutes while looking for a group?  Its possible that it will.  Nobody can say that it won't for sure until it is implemented.  I will say that the superior healing change will be a bigger boon to shaman than druids.  Most druids will still fizzle a ton as they aren't specialized in alteration.<P>Since this is whine-play, I truly expect somebody will take exception to this post.  It was not written to be a detractant from the clerics argument.  I think that the primary (and most valid) complaint that clerics have is that they need more toys.  Having an adjustment to the power of the other healing classes will not change that problem for the worse.  It may make some situations better.  You may be able to tell that shaman you are grouped with that you would like to nuke a little bit and let him/her take some of the healing load off.<P>Pokes<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Magicx, you seriously do know nothing about what the shaman spells actually do.  The reason canabalize is not unbalancing in a shaman is lower base WIS. Canabalize is the equalizer in mana between the priest classes.  Most shaman end up maxing out at 175 WIS which is a full 250+ mana difference between them and the other priest classes.  Most casting classes have some form of mana regeneration.  Wizards gather mana, enchanters clarity line, shaman canabalize, necros do their dark pact, mages make newbie poppers for emergency use.  Clerics and druids are the only ones that get left out on any of these type (druids may get something, but it isn't prevalent) of spells.  Stat buffs don't do anything worth mentioning (go see the shaman gripe that gets popped to the top on a regular basis and read Tugg's write up on the current shaman issues).<P>You talk about balance issues with shaman and pets.  You say this and so it proves that you have no idea that NPCs have no physical stats that have merit (STR, DEX, AGI, etc).  Give a pet that hits for 40 points max a STR buff, you know what it hits for?  40 points.  Give it a dex buff, does it crit or proc or hit more?  nope, shaman pets do not duel wield or proc or cast, etc.  Give it agi.  Does it get hit less?  Nope.  Does stamina make it live longer due to more HPs?  Nope.  Now, we can give it talisman and speed it up to actually make it live through a fight and possibly deal some damage.  Have a melee class of level 50 go into a duel with a shaman of level 50 with a pet.  The pet in general hits about 1 in 10 attempts and then does about 5 points of damage.  There is a reason that Verant says we aren't a pet class and that we only have a companion.  Basically, the pet in many cases isn't worth the extensive amount of mana to cast it.<P>Giving the change in the healing capability should in no way be a precursor to a nerf of shaman.  If by any reading, I think the only class that seems primed for a nerf is the necros.<P>Pokes</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Please stop lumping shamen and druids together. Shamen do not solo anywhere close to as easily as druids, although we can solo better than clerics. There are far fewer shamen than druids and shamen are probably less common than clerics (hard to tell with all you clerics anon). Shamen are played in large part because if you want to be a barbarian, troll, or ogre caster, you are a shaman. In groups (1-42) I mostly heal because there are not enough healers of any kind except druids, and they are not grouping at those levels. Shamen are (so far) getting less of a healing boost than druids. If I am required to be a healer up to some level because there aren't enough other healers, what happens when I am no longer a viable healer option?<P>I agree that clerics need more variety, but if as others have said, EVERYONE else is waiting around for groups until the ONLY viable healers show up, then Verant WILL make changes because 98% of the players will be asking for them.

</FONT><HR>To Alan,<P>Well after thinking about all that is happened I am truly disappointed on the decision that has been made about giving away a class specialty ability to other classes.  Clerics pay a high price for the very few abilities they receive.  Clerics heal and clerics protect.  That is it.  They do not receive any further abilities past those two points.  In comparison other classes have such diversity and offer far more options to a group than a cleric can.  I have played a cleric for well over a year along with a few other classes and the differences are quite striking.<P>I constantly hear discussions about class balance and game balance.  Here is a point:  List all the players that play each class and total them up.  I would not be surprised in the least to find that clerics are the least played class in the game.  Especially if you keep track of all the current - active - clerics and not mule characters used for exp resurrections only.  Another point is that if clerics are such a fantastic class to play, then we would find clerics running all over the place.  Think about it.  How many times have you run by people and notice a cleric in a group or in the area?  Lastly, people tend to play classes that offer the most benefit to both themselves and to the group. This basically translates to class value in Everquest.<P>Now for the sake of true class and game balance where is the balance here?  Please demonstrate to me how clerics fit into this description of balance?<P><BR>What does everyone else thing about this?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Clerics the least played class in the game!?!<P>I think you will find that SK's, Paladins, Bards, and possibly Shaman and Rangers have you beat in that area. Wizards may be another contender. Depending on your server of course but I bet it hold pretty generally true. Especially if you don't count those under about level 20.<P>Anyway, I wanted to make a suggestion for those Clerics demending something in return for the changes on Test. How about an Undead-Only snare? You guys can already solo undead at many levels and I think that the snare in conjunction with your undead nukes, undead fears, and stuns would make that one less bad thing about playing a cleric. You would be able to solo.<P>I also think that, since you would not be asking for another class's ability and that it fits generally with the Vision(tm) of the cleric in Norrath, you might actually have a decent chance of getting it to happen. What do you guys think?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>If you're a cleric arguing that you don't have damage dealing abilities or traveling abilities like druids or shamans, think about this for a bit.<P>A group needs a healer and damage dealers to be successful.  Healer spot = Cleric.  Damage spot = ~10 classes that could all fit the bill.<P>Still think being able to deal damage is a good motivation to be in a group?

He does not want to wait around for hours until a cleric is available so that he can play.<BR>C.In the absence of a cleric he will take a shaman or druid so that he can enjoy his play time.<P>I'll say this over and over (and feel like I have)- these changes are not about hurting clerics and they are not about making shaman and druids uber. They are about increasing the fun for the other 11 classes, many of whom rely on a healer to do anything at the upper levels.<P>It's incredibly selfish to expect all the other people playing the game to have to stop and wait for a cleric to log on so that they can start playing. <P>It amazes me that Clerics and Warriors are so insecure about their roles in the game when they are the two classes everyone is still going to want to have even after the changes if they go live.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, can't they give clerics something then? Now druids are good at offense and decent at healing post 50, while clerics are bad at offense and great at healing. Not quite as balanced. Anyway its easy for all you druids to say "quit whining cleric monopolizer! Troll bastard!", but what are YOU doing in the process.

</FONT><HR>I never ceased to be amazed by the posters who talk about clerics complaining.  Clerics have had an unending list of nerfs lately with absolutely nothing done to soften the blow.  These posters are either:<P>1) Totally uninformed of the nerfs<BR>2) So wrapped up in getting what they want that they don't give a flip what happens to the dynamics of game playing for the rest of the classes.<P>The group of clerics most hurt by these nerfs are those between 39 an 55 (a cleric's life prior to 39 already sucks but we have lived with it this long so there is little point in going there).  In groups of 55+ clerics still shine.  Remember that clerics are one of the few classes that have to compete with virtually any other cleric who can also cast Cheal(level39 spell).  I often invite 39+ clerics on higher level raids because they can still heal high level tanks.  Of course their experience advancement when grouped with higher level players totally sucks, but that's another story.  The problem is clerics have to get to 55+ in the first place.  <P>A cleric's life is not an easy one.  Clerics lack the versatility of druid and shaman.  As a result clerics don't have the options these classes have when clerics can't find a group.  The short term effect is that a non-primetime high level cleric will become even rarer than they are now.  Fewer players will start clerics or stick with them until clerics reach the higher levels because of the increased difficulty in finding groups.  <P>In the long run, all classes will suffer because experience rezzes will become harder and harder to find.  It is hard to predict what Verant's reaction will be to this change or how long it will take them to realize it is happening.  Who knows, maybe level 60 druids and shaman will get experience rez someday like the paladins.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Gizi,<BR>   You have just re-iterated my point no nothing<BR>has been done to us thats an improvement quite the oppisite we have been infact severely nerfed over the last 12 months we several of our class specific items changed and several of our spells nerfed.  If we are so balanced why are we continually caned with the nerfing stick we are not that balanced.<BR>   Several classes have been improved drastically over the last 12 months and much of the additions have been to give these classes clerical core abilities so that players have an option when there is not a cleric I agree with some of these issues.  What I disagree with is that they are not looking at the overal issue why are there so few clerics on the servers.  So too any zone and<BR>do a who all cleric, then do a who all druid by general default their is 4-5 more druids just my observation so the out cry that druids can't get a group is mainly because groups don't need 2 of them they only need 1 and the abundance of them on the servers is the overall problem although they can go and solo if they like alot still prefer to group for the chance at certain items and they feel that they can't get them because they can't get a group.  Fair enough but this change is not going to change this problem infact it is going to introduce clerics into the same situation of can't find a group etc but unlike druids we are unable to go solo something.<BR>   I agree shamans should get a healing improvement afterall they are the dark race cleric for certain races and they can't solo as well as a druid but they still can solo so again I come back to the problem clerics without a group is stuffed druid/shaman without a group is still playable.  Now do you see what I am trying to get at here.<BR>   If we are giving spells away to other classes I would like splurt clearly a Cleric spell or how about camoflouge (utility spell) better yet lets have Wildfire call it umm Divine Blast. You starting to see my point yet?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>All you people calling cleric's "whiners" need to wake up and see what we're saying.  We're not saying Druids (well, I'm saying druids, but most people aren't) and Shamans don't need new heals.  Shamans especially needed some heal upgrades post 50 since all their stat buffs don't mean that much except for the Dex buff for more procs and crits and maybe Agi and Sta to get a little extra hps and AC.  We're not even saying that it is right that a post 40 group can't survive very easily without a cleric.  Obviously no class should be so necessary that a group can't take on single pulls without them.<P>What we're saying is, we have been nerfed in both spells and in armor since Kunark was released.  We have not recieved a single enhancement.  NOTHING.  All melees got disciplines. hybrids lost their exp penalty, had their mana pools increased, and got some hybrid specific new spells designed to enhance melee abilities.  Wizards got Harvest along with the ability to buy any port spell (they used to be critter drops only, but that was changed).  Druids, well, enough has been said about them.  Shamans had their pets levels increased (I agree this needed to be done) and are getting new heals.  Bards are getting 2 new songs, but they were hit hard with the nerf stick too so it's only right.  Necros had their pets given auto-dual wield (no more carrying daggers around), Mages got auto dual wield and are recieving several new spells.  Chanters... well, they are the clerics of the Int caster world and are getting screwed too.  Rogues had a whole bunch of new stuff added to them over the past year, but once again they were pretty messed up so it was only right.  Still, a rogue is now about as necessary for a group in several zones as a cleric or chanter is, and rogues can do other things than pick locks and find/disarm traps in those few zones where they are found.<P>I really don't understand why you can't see what's going on here.  It took a long time to reach the breaking point for clerics.  We had a few people complaining now and then when we were stealth nerfed or when other classes were getting upgraded and we weren't.  We got a little upset about Pallys getting a 50% rezz, but we still get a 90% and a 96%, so I guess it's all good.  MoK was one of the few things that got a lot of clerical attention, and rightly so.  They took a useful spell and turned it into a spell-slot holder and damage shield remover.  Now the one thing we can still do is being handed out like candy to make Druids and Shamans feel more useful.  In return, we've recieved nothing.  Not a dang thing.  What was the last cleric upgrade?  Lets see... oh, I know!  We got an undead only DoT.  No, wait, that spell is completely useless, my bad.  It does 185 less damage than our 44th undead DD and costs only 20 less mana.  <P>I guess I'm just sick of being left out of the fold.  Call it a whine, because it kinda is.  It is definantly class envy, because I am espressing envious feelings about all the upgrades other classes are getting while we get nothing but nerfs.  <P>You know what spell bone would make me feel better?  Give Valor a 2 per tick regen, Resolution a 4 per tick regen, Heroic bond a 4 per tick regen and a 2 per tick mana regen.  Fortitude a 6 per tick regen with a 4 per tick mana regen.  Suddenly I would feel better, and it's really a small upgrade.  Just give us something here!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

That is what Rezz is.  If you are in a group that needs to keep a cleric aorund just for rezzing then I suggest you try an easier zone or get a smarter healer.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I play a warrior and a cleric, so I can't help feeling left out by recent changes being tried on test as my abilities in both classes are given to other classes (and I get nothing in return).  Yes, both classes still have their role, but what about making them fun to play?  They both have a very narrow focus (healing and main tank/meat shield), so I think both should be undisputed masters of their roles.  We give up having a wide variety of abilities in exchange for a high level of specialization.  Narrowing the gap in our specializations between us and other classes is, IMHO, a huge mistake.  If other classes are getting close to us in our specialization AND they can do so many other things, guess which class will be more fun to play? hmmm.... no offense to druids, but it's not like there's a shortage of them.  Main request: if you insist on giving away some of our core abilities to other classes, then we should get something useful in return so that the classes are both balanced and fun to play.  I'd prefer to keep things as is though.<P>Now to be fair, my warrior will still want a cleric as the primary healer over a shaman or druid in pretty much EVERY situation.  It's a combination of the cleric have rez, better heals, and quite frankly because too many druids I've grouped with don't know how to be a primary healer. However, I love having a druid/shaman AND a cleric in the group.<BR> <BR>::Warning - Rant ahead::<BR>They get nuke happy and then don't have the needed mana for heals to save lives and minimize group downtime.  I really HATE seeing 1 or 2 heals cast and then having the druid say he's "lom" at the end of the battle so we all have to wait.  Thankfully some do know their role, but too many don't.  Anyway... pet peeve of mine... the other thing is shamans requesting upgrades.  huh?! Shamans are a superb class already!  I think they are great in my groups.  I have a number of friends with multiple 50+ characters who really feel that shamans are THE power class now, partly due to abilities, partly items (like that insanely powerful DD bracer they get... I'm amazed it hasn't been nerfed).  So you're not wonderful on direct encounters with dragons, gods, and a few other uber-mobs.
