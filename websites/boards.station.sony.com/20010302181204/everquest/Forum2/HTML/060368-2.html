</FONT><HR>How about the 60 and 65+ mobs?  Say your warrior has 5000hp.  Take Velketor for an example uber encounter.  Now, he melees four times a round for 850dmg.  That comes to 3400hp.<P>70% - 80%....when YOU want them to heal....is 3500-4000hp.  So in essence several clerics would have to time and chain a cel elixir or what have you EVERY melee round.<P>Ah, but with the new aggro, now after the first round/heal he turns on the cleric.  Now what?  The other clerics can't heal that one, as they will fall in turn.  The warrior CANNOT taunt the mob off the cleric.  That cleric dies.<P>Back to the warrior...another 3400+dmg, another heal -- ah, another dead cleric.<P>I don't think you comprehend the issues at hand here.  This isn't a 'boy, the imperial crypt guardian hits for 140 a round, the cleric can just heal after 75% rather than wait to CH' kinda deal here.  This is a 'Verant FUBAR'd big time and everyone who ISN'T a cleric can stand back and laugh it off because they don't know jack.'<P>And by the way, I play a wizard.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Yes we now have 100% equality in healing spells for all the priest classes, except there is a major difference between the priest classes in usefullness now.  With the druid/shaman New healing spells, and us being screwed out of ever using cheal unless we are willing to die for it, clerics have no use in a party if a druid or shaman can be found.  Druids have damage shields, regeneration, good direct damage, teleports to get you to the mob, evac, and DOT's.  Shamans have resist & speed debuffs, attack speed buffs, good direct damage, good DOT's, a pet, mana regen for theirselves....  They both have SOW which helps anyone who cant gate or FD escape bad situations.<P>What do clerics have to offer a party other than heals?  Lets take a look, we have quite possibly the worst direct damage in the game, No DOT's, No Debuff's, No Damage Shield, and No buffs except for hit point and armor class buffs(which druids and shamans and paladins have)...  Oh yes I forgot, we offer a group resurrections that no other class can offer, oh wait nevermind, paladins can do that in the late 50's, so why kill trakanon with a cleric/warrior combo in your group when you could have a paladin/warrior combo instead?<P>And the druids/shamans will still take every group away from a cleric that can get a druid/shaman instead of them, even pre lvl 59.  Nobody will put up with the inferior priest class in their group when that person can only heal once or twice before they die, and then only really help the group AFTER the battle, and not during, by giving some exp back to the members of the party that died.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;...this aggro 'balancing' is Verant's way of getting Complete Heal out of the game without actually having to remove it...<BR>100% equality in healing spells for the priest classes, and they didn't even have to share or remove CH.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Quandry,<P>you claim that clerics have had to deal with aggro is UNTRUE<P>************<BR>We've redressed the amount of hate generated by heal spells. Previously, and *partly* due to a bug, the high level heal spells such as superior heal or complete heal would generate no more hate than greater heal. In fact, so little hate was generated by these spells that it made controlling NPC aggression trivial<BR>******************<P>HENCE, clerics have been casting a 3K HP heal that caused no more aggro than a GREATER HEAL.<BR>gee someone chime in and tell the level of that heal?  now compare casting a heal that has aggro equal to a greater heal while fighting a 51+ mob.  What's that equal?  Considering the size of the mob it equals next to NO aggro.<P>want a fairer comparison?  I can CHAIN CAST my 24 nuke forever in an encounter and not get aggro.  Why?  Because that nuke does jack &^%$ for aggro to a 51+ mob.  That is what clerics were doing with CH prior to this patch.<P>So clerics have gotten used to casting CH with impunity.  Now all of a sudden there are consequences and clerics panic.<P>Learn some strategy and adjust.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have never played a cleric - only an enchanter and mage.  My question is (pardon if I am totally off base here), have any of the clerics tried Atone to see if it helps with the agro situation?  If it does help, maybe an AE version would help with your situation and you might want to push Verant for that.  <P>Also, if it doesn't work (I know Enchanter Blur series is less effective on mobs over level 35 and it's effects are very similar to Atone), then maybe you should push Verant so that it's more effective on high-level mobs.<P>Just a few suggestions to help the clerics since Verant seems pretty firm on these new changes.  If Verant won't change the agro back to the way it was, maybe ask them for more ways to help keep the agro off of you.<P>Knat </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>  "The mob is at 80% and the tank is at 30%, you need a better group"<P>  I'm sorry, but when something quads for 550, and does 2000+ damage per round, when exactly should you heal them? In between their duel wield double attack checks?  Or do you think a warrior can hit the mob back for the same amount of damage in order to balance out the hate list?  Or maybe, as one person suggested, we should use divine light :)<P>  The mobs were designed around the use of CH, now we can't use CH, but the mobs are the same.  Please, don't talk to me about the &lt;50 game, thats not whats at issue as far as I'm concerned.  When you need 4 clerics healing one warrior just so he lives through a fight (We're talking single mob, completely immune to magic btw, so throw out your root/snare ideas, and oh yeah, if you mem blur, it wipes the hate list, and uber mobs instantly regen somewhere in the neighborhood of 30% of their HP back, which, in some cases is upwards of 300k)<P>  I'm listening to all the brilliant suggestions, if you'd like numbers, I have numbers.  Single mob encounter, warriors takes upwards of 35k damage, dishes out 6k.  How did you plan to heal that 35k hp? Add more clerics?  The game already has ridiculous amounts of LD problems with any encounter over 35 people, unless every person is on dsl+.  Should we now have 1 warrior, and 34 clerics to heal him?  (35k hp, healed with divine light is 5.5 clerics worth of full mana by the way, thats assuming none of the heals are wasted)<P>Just my .02<BR>Khalim Richelieu <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Cuprin, think about what you're saying, would you?  <P>If the healer casts too soon they get aggroed. That's why clerics have learned to wait.<P>Now if the cleric waits, he gets aggroed even worse.<P>Put it into a caster perspective.<P>Wizard waits unil a mob is fully engaged before unloading a DD onto it.  Now we change things so that even if the mob is down 40 percent, he's still going to get a ride to the top of the hate list for a single blast.<P>For cerics, what this is going to come down to is waiting to the tank to be at two bubbles then healing him for one bubble worth of HPs while hes going down even more, then trying to keep him around 1.5 to 2 bubbles and hoping the mob doesn't unload a really good shot that will take the tank out.<P>There is No other strategy left other then intentionally deleveling to 50 and staying there forever.<P>You can't heal early, and now you can't heal late for a good amount.  That means the only thing the cleric can do is cross his fingers and hope the dice keep rolling in favor of the tank, or that the group doesn't mind getting most of their experience back after they all get killed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, one thing can be said now: Clerics are no longer as boring as they used to be. Right?<P>Have you tried "Root"? In the cleric guide to soloing to 51 in Lower Guk (casters realm) it recommends use of the low level root spell as it is not much less effective than the upgrades and it much more mana efficient. <P>How about root, heal, then your mem-blur spell (atone I think it is)?<P>Having the Enchanter Mem-Blur it for you?<P>Tried your stuns?<P>Necro Screaming Terror?<P>How about getting a Paladin in the group and having him chain-stun to build agro and reduce the damage done to you?<P>I'm not saying that all, or any, of these will work. These are just some ideas I thought of off the top of my head. I AM saying that there are other options/strategies to be explored before saying the sky is falling and all clerics should quit...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Chyrlene, you are so missing the point. I've played a 50+ Wizard, a 50+ Enchanter, a 50+ Cleric, and soon a 50+ Monk. I have a REAL good understanding of the indepth mechanics of aggro. Better than most players.<P>The point you have totally missed is simple. What gets a Wizard in trouble with her group? Nuking too soon or too much, right? Because we know what happens. And guess what, she has control over when and how often she nukes. Such amazing world design. BUT, the Cleric gets in trouble with her group for what? Anyone? For letting group members die, right? And guess what! Now with the aggro list changes, the Cleric has to decide a) heal the tank who will be dead in 15 seconds if I don't, but which will cause me or the group to die anyway, or b) don't heal the tank.<P>You think the Wizards' choice and the new Clerics' choice are equivalent? Please say you don't.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>ATONE IS CRAP.  Get that through your heads people, and DISCARD it as an idea.  NONE of you have played this game as a cleric in the high end raids that is SO evident.  A dwarf cleric (I have a lvl 52 dwarf cleric) has a charisma of 45.  No typo there, 45.  So Atone just doesn't work all that often, and NEVER on mobs over lvl 52 for me.  So I can chain cast atone till I'm OOM and every one in the party is DEAD and it won't work.  Oh but of course I could swap out all my AC and wisdom gear for charisma gear, I've seen that suggestion before, such BRILLANT insight were getting from you people.  Let me tell you, when your all dying in multi party wipe outs because your druids and shaman and clerics are getting killed, you won't be in such a feeding frenzy anymore.  But the damage is done.  I'm seriously considering the no more rez thing.  See how you like de-leveling awhile.  I bet you don't hate that cleric that just restored 5 hours worth of play time for you do you?  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>hehe<P>So funny, people are ready to put down clerics and even call them Newbies because of the new behavior...<P>One of those people is a Mage.  Which has a pet.  Which can nuke when it is safe...  And won't be the BIG guy on the agrro list in a good group to begin with.  A cleric's job is Only to heal.  They can't deal damage, and shouldn't in a group.<P>I understand them making the Breastplate harder to use cause of the "No mana" use.  But making that a CH will probably get you killed....  How do you time a CH ?  Cause the lower the hp on the tank.... the higher you're hate...  If you cast too soon, better use a SH... and if this is what the Tactics is going to become... than Druids and Shaman will then have the Cleric's spot.  Why ?  Well, if you HAVE to use a SH cause the CH will get you killed, then the Druid & Shaman are a Direct Good Replacement for that.<P>All I can say... it's sad.  I've played other games...  and you learn to live with you're strong points and your weak points...  And know where you're going.  EverQuest is becoming a Hectic world where you can be part of the Classes that get Stronger points Enhanced... or part of the Classes that have Weaker points Enhanced...  And when you have 3 chars and you end up being part of the Weak points getting worse... it gets pretty depressing.  What ?  Start a new char ?  Some people would like to play to reach 50 if at all possible...  But when you find out that it's probably not worth the frustration...  It sucks.<P>I think the changes they did to the Hybrid were Excellent.  Those to Druids and Shaman were very much needed...  But the effects on heals...  Were a bit rash from what I read all over the board.  Seems yet another change not tested, and not really thought of at all by the Guru of Verant Nerf association.<P>As much as I loved playing EQ...  I read so many Negative threads here... I'm not sure if I want to continue any of my chars to feel the frustrations I keep reading here.  We play this game for "Fun"... and when the "Fun" is taken away from it...  What's left ?  And again...  Only a few classes have been hit hard enough to take a degree of fun out of their classes....  Other classes are happy, and I'm also happy for them...  but Verant needs to stop using the Balancing stick and removing any more "Fun" from the classes as they are.  "Getting adjusted" ?  If you play 20, 30 or 50 lvls knowing your Character and knowing what to do, and not do...  How can people be bitter towards cleric when all of a sudden 50-60 lvl's of experience changes to something Foreigh ?  If you're class has been semi-tedious for 50 lvls, how can you be happy that the Clerics is as tedious as yours if not worse...  It's one thing to grow into that knowledge... it's another when it's slammed in your face the way Verant keeps doing it to some classes.<P>I see compassion for others pain is not what people know in these discussion...  All I read is about "You finally feel our pain" type of discussion...  If feel real bad with people living their life pointing fingers and feeling good out of others misfortune...  I'm curious of what these same people will do when they get hit by something like this...  Mages got hit as well as Necros a few months back.  I felt the change.... and you have a Mage here being happy about the Cleric's pain...  Wow... Maturity at it's best....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

What, do you like to stare at your spellbook for 15 minutes between pulls while you cyber with the guy playing the dark elf chick?<P>I for one do NOT like to sit around while my group recovers mana between fights.  That's what's going to be happening as the clerics go oom trying not to build up aggro.  <P>Clerics don't have a choice as to when to heal.  Puller gets stunned a few times on the pull?  He's gonna be at less than 2 bubbles when he gets back to camp.  <P>Know what's going to happen?  either the cleric will cheal him and die, cast less efficient heals during the fight and run oom halfway thru the battle, or use 'aggro-avoidance tactics' and watch the puller die, rezzing him after the fight or watching everyone else die (after all, rezzing is much more mana efficient than healing)<P>You do a /who all 50 60 shaman on my server and you see 6.  You do a /who all 50 60 druid on my server and you see 12.   I've heard that Verant introduce this new aspect of the game (which they didn't test AT ALL..obviously means it's perfect) in part to make shamans and druids more viable group healers in the lvl 50+ game.  Well, they just 'helped' 18 people and hurt everyone who's lvl 50+ on my server.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

There is NO crowd control on 50+ mobs on that continent.  What are people supposed to do there post 50?  Die I guess.<P>It seems that there are ways around the cleric taunt problem in the "normal" areas of EQ (chanters, bards necros, root, stun, timing etc) but in Velious none of this will work.<P>I guess you are supposed to use "one shot" clerics to heal tanks fighting 100% magic immune 60k hp mobs...lol the disposable cleric :P<P>Anyway guys, I hear ya.<P>Akariel 52 chanter</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You people have no clue do you? The CLASS DEFINING spell for a cleric is COMPLETE HEAL. This is why clerics were pissed about druids/shamans getting remedy and other healing spells. Verant was the first to point this out. "Clerics will not be hurt as their primary role is a healer. No class other than cleric gets complete heal". Now they make CH a death sentence. I don't care what they say about "the amount of hate is not equal to a warriors full hit points". They are wrong. This was the most moronic thing I have ever seen them do.<P>If you don't want clerics in the game, remove them. There is simply no way for people to do the mobs in Velious and parts of Kunark with this nerf. The entire encounter table for all of Velious was designed for the "uber hit point tank" and the CHing cleric. You try a quad hitting for 850 mob that has 200,000+ hit points and let us know how it goes when every cleric is dead within seconds. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>People dont think very much it seems. If you are fighting a mob hitting for 800 or something, chances are there is more then one warrior and one cleric am I right? I even bet there is an enchanter. Did you know enchanters have some high level, nigh unresistable mem blurs? Ever think of having the enchanter help manage agro? Or do you honestly just sit there with a cleric and a warrior CH'ing? Stupidest tactic I have ever heard of.<P>Clerics, sorry to say, have been coddled with CH being non-agro. Verant did screw up making the mobs around this, but people's tactics will change and they will overcome. The good clerics I know are already changing and doing just dandy. A fully buffed, heavily armored cleric should be able to tank anything, period.<P>Pretty soon everyone will be happily killing and this will be forgotten, things will be back to usual with different tactics. Shaman and druids can step in and help heal now too, and I know shaman wont care, they tank great and do it often now.<P>Animol</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Why ridicule someone for at least trying to think of solutions? Would any of the proposed solutions work in an EXP group in Sebilis which was the initial topic of this thread?<P>Quote: "This isn't about you and your friend sitting in the frenzy spawn. This is about mobs with poison dots that do 15k dmg....mobs with 1,000,000+ HP that take 20 mins to kill. Mobs that do upwards of 2000dmg+ per EVERY round."<P>No, this is about an EXP (Not Trak) group in Sebilis. Those MOBs not not have the above mentioned attributes.<P>Quote: "There is no strategy involved here. You must heal right away, or the tank dies. If you heal right away, you die. This is all anyone's been left with."<P>So long as nobody tries to think of a strategy, and flames everyone who tries, this is probably true. If people try to think about it though, there may be an answer.<P>Quote: "Before coming up with these 'ideas' of yours, either talk with someone who's played the high lvl game, or wait till you level there yourself. Otherwise, ****"<P>Uber encounters and magic immune MOBs are a different problem than the one being discussed here. We are talking about strategies for EXP grouping in the "high lvl game". For ubermobs/magic immune mobs other strategies will have to be discussed. How about DA & DB after healing for a total of 36 sec of immunity and having multiple clerics around to pass the aggro around? Cleric 1 CH's then DA's then DB's if that is not enough time for the tanks and non-evading rogues, etc. to taunt him off you then cleric 2 pops a CH on you and catches aggro. Rinse and repeat. Might be worth trying if you can get enough clerics on the raid. I figure 7 clerics can do this indefinately with DB alone so long as aggro can be handed of etc.<P>Again, I am not saying that this will work. I am just saying let's try to think about possible solutions instead of restating the problem hundreds of times in multiple threads. I can't believe that people are so irrational as to flame those who are at least trying to brainstorm solutions for them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>As another mage, I agree with the people who are pointing out that casting heal is not the same as timing nukes.  While I'm only level 49 now, some of the effects were obvious last night.  We are an offense heavy group to begin with (two rangers, two mages, rogue, cleric) and the cleric never has anything to do unless we pull doubles or triples, which we often do.<P>The biggest change we saw last night is that while we all focused on one mob, a heal from the cleric, and he wasn't using CH, meant that the two we weren't focused on would go right for the cleric.  When that happened, as it did occasionally before, we did our usual routine... myself and the other mage pull our pets off, stick them on one of the other mobs each, and give it a little love tickle (a nice 600pt nuke).  Most of the time last night it took two nukes to get them off the cleric.  And those are low blues to us too!  (We weren't gonna experiment with high reds  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  If those had been tougher mobs the cleric would have been dead.  Now granted, for xp fighting, it might just say "stick with the low blues" and "don't pull adds", but I can't imagine how on earth our next trip to Skyshrine to fight the cubes is gonna go.<P>I think they will probably have to make some more changes to this before all is said and done.... or changes to the ubermobs.<P>Leo.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree with Gimmel.  I also happen to be in his guild on Veeshan, and I know he is a competent, excellent Cleric.  Those of you criticizing him should group with him and/or play a cleric yourself to such high levels before spewing such offhand commentary.  <P>I do not play the cleric to be a pincushion or punching bag (by default) either.  Just because I have armor doesn't mean that by default, I must be beaten upon constantly and usually to death.  I play the cleric to have fun, heal people and be effective.<P>My options?  Retire the cleric, play my twink chanter or *gulp* gimp wizard.  Since neither class is as fun or satisfying as the cleric, I may end up quitting EQ.  These are not threats, just facts.  These facts are not directed at you people out there with the standard response "good luck, dont let the door hit you on the way out" attitude either, its directed at the dev team. <P>Of course, someone must play clerics or there will be a lot of dead warriors (and other classes).  Oh well, maybe all the druids and shm in the world will simply take over.  Enjoy.  Who cares.  <P>These arguments aside, reverse the cleric nerf (per majority). It was fine the way it was for years-TM. Further discussion is not necessary. Thanks.<P>Aside from that...Gimmel is a level 60 cleric in one of the most powerful guilds on Veeshan.  If he wasn't a cleric or maybe not 60 or something, you would discount him in some other way because he's being honest?  What other qualifications are needed to get an honest opinion regarding a nerf in this game?  You have a level 60 cleric who has been directly affected by this nerf and here he is posting his personal opinion/feelings on how it has affected him.  Off you guys go "diss'ing" him for it and making it sound like he is bad or doesn't know what he's talking about.<P>This goes to show you what kind of people we are dealing with on these boards.<P>Just how much more personal do things have to get in the game for you people to accept that a level 60 cleric knows what he's talking about?  Or perhaps that never crossed your minds.  I would go so far as to say that a level 60 person playing any class character is considered an expert on that particular class, over and above the supposed "experts" who make design changes on the dev team.  Like it or not, you cannot and will not discount them out of hand.  Someone will and must listen to them. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Welp I shelved my 53 cleric last night. Why? Because I went to res a guild member in unrest, he got trained as I was buffing him after res, I cast remedy on him, and had 6 or 7 mobs now chasing my clerical butt. Everyone around me started attacking the mobs... we're talking YARD TRASH HERE FOLKS POUNDING ME. I couldn't even begin to defend myself. A level 53 cleric, getting smacked around by mobs 40 levels below him. NOBODY could get the trash off me. The druid taxi I had with me had to AOE lightning blast everything. <P>Thanks Verant. Thanks for breaking my cleric playing addiction.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This post was in response to the total nerfing of clerics.  In day to day xp groups, such as lower guk II (sebilis) this can be managed.<P>Where it cannot be managed is in the high level encounters I was talking about.<P>Recast time on DA and DB is 10 mins.  As I stated some of these mobs take 20 mins to kill.  You banking that they'll reset before the fight is out?  Who heals if more than 7 people get aggroed while you're invulnerable?  DA and DB also have 1.0 and 2.0 cast times, you banking that you'll get those spells off now? <P>I'm sorry, but you cannot explain away this nerf with 'well, you didn't think of this or strategize this'.  Any situation in the high level game is now next-to-impossible.<P>And what about the next-to-impossible encounters of before?  What of Kerafyrm?  Quads for 1250 a round, I would have liked to see FoH or AL take him down.  What an achievement that would have been.<P>Now it's a pipe-dream.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>What I was trying to point out Quan was that now cleric will have to adapt and over come....waaa....ok so now they are going to be hated for complete healing .....but guess what u have to adapt to this. Find new ideas and new ways of playing. So the cleric will now be agroed if he heals....ok well guess what every caster has a way of pissing off the mobs. Wizard....big nukes....mages big nukes (ever see a mage run when root breaks)....enchanter......mez breaks......shaman.....we slow or dot the mob.......druid snare or dot the mob.......<BR>Yes complete heal is a class defining ability.<BR>So now the cleric can't just do it when ever he wants. So they made the game a little more diffcult. Well I guess groups will have to learn new ways of playing.

</FONT><HR>Clerics are easily the most uncreative class in the game.  Clerics aren't boring--the players behind them are boring.  They all act as if they are in a two-person group: warrior/cleric.  Are there no paladins to stun and root the MOBs?  Are there no rangers to root, DOT, and attack the MOBs?  Are there no backup healers (*gasp*) to heal the cleric and help with healing others?  Are there no Ducks of Death to piss off the MOB?  Is healing really the only thing that aggros the MOB?<P>Try something new--it's just a game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think most people have missed the point. Every other classes agro that has been overcome is because the class that caused the agro taught the group how to best deal with it.<P>From almost every single post I have read, the cleric is still trying to heal a single warrior and has died because of it. Change the strategy.<P>Teach the multiple tanks to move agro around maybe, wait on casting that heal till the last tank is low, then heal the first tank who can then take agro again.<P>Use the little heals on the secondary tanks (rogues, rangers, etc...) Try casting a stun or getting someone else to, just before a heal. Have a shammie slow the mob, they hit like pansies after a shammie has done his thing, gives you more time alive while they taught it off. Have a secondary healer cast a few SH's and save that CH for when really needed, who knows.<P>How about making a shammie or druid responsible for keeping you alive? When I used to play a druid I could keep a enchanter with a mob on him alive with chain casting GH most of the time (in Sebilis).<P>There has to be about 100 different strategies that can be used depending who is in the group, I hope you clerics have enough imagination after all these years of atrophy to try some out instead of banging your head against the wall with the old one.<P>Sounds to me like it might actually be fun to play a cleric again, may have to start mine back up, only level 20 or so now, but he can level pretty quickly.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060368-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060368.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060368-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060368-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=060368&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=060368&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
