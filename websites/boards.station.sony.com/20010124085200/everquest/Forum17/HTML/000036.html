</FONT><HR>This is an observation, and even though this board is barren, it seems to be the appropriate place.<P>I just want to say that I have unfortunately had to have several instances with our guides and GM Therdir (sp?) lately, and it appears to me that E'ci has really improved its CS. <P>Although I don't like the slew of bannings for having different people log onto different accounts, and I hope they rethink that policy quickly and apologize to all who have been suspened/banned unwarranted recently.<P>The reimbursement I needed was verified quickly and the item returned I have seen several others receive reimbursements for items lost to bugs, and the staff has been courteous and empathetic weeven on things they could not help with.<P>I think Therder cares about keeping the players happy as much as he can, and the guide quality seems to be much higher than it was.  For a volunteer staff that is overworked and not paid they are really trying and dedicated. Its too easy to forget that.<P>I think E'ci is moving in the right direction in support, except for that one above horrible mistake.  I say this because I myself am a customer service rep and I know we rarely get enough people thanking us for the hard work we do, and the way some customers treat us.  Its not always fun to be a target with limited powers standing right in front of the abuse.<P>I know how the boards work and if this gets read some will think I am sucking up. I'm not and I don't care what you think so waste your time responding if you care.  I have merely seen a positive trend I like and want to observe on that.<P>Thanks again and Good Day!!!<P>and bring back Bolenie, I dont want to have to map SoV myself for goodness sakes.  Seriously, I don't understand how a player of Bolenie's character can get banned, a policy like that is just plain wrong!!!!!!! </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here is my counter-point to Hiwei's comments...<P>I wish I could have as good of an experience as you with GMs durring my 17 months of playing EQ.<P>My most recent example is with my newbie character "Tocdog" and GM "Sekle".  I lent my newbie my Runed Falchion while leveling in Misty Thicket.  I was having a bit of a bad night (died three times in about 15 minutes), so after my last death, I collected my items from my corpse, ran back to the wall next to the guards, then sat and memmed my spells.  After that was done, I /camp for the night...  Now the fun begins; when I log back on three days later, everything that I was wearing and carrying is gone.  No food, no water.  I /corpse in Misty and Rivervale just in case my mind is gone.  Nothing...  Of course, I do a /petition and politely tell GM Sekle my troubles.  He, for whatever reason, gives me the "bums rush" and says "Sorry nothing I can do for you, the logs dont go back that far".  I ask if there is anything else that I can do about it being that I am not Trump rich in game.  No reply from GM Sekle.  I shrug and shake my head...<P>Of course, this is an isolated incident.  Aren't they all?  Just ask your GM friends to tell you about Tolkein/Tocsin from their message boards.<P>I know that being a GM is most likely not a fun job when you are the bearer of bad news...  But if possible, treat us, the common player, your peers, with a little more courtsey and respect so long as they do so to you.<P>Just my two cents.  BTW, when you have pennies, toss them onto the sidewalks...  Someone has to put all the lucky pennies out for others... I do =)<P><BR>Tocsin / Tocdog<BR>Member in good standing of The Dragon Born<BR>E'Ci Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Greetings one and all. <BR>This is a very good post, i personally think that E'ci is a superb server. I have characters on other servers and think that E'ci staff are most helpful.<P>I have had to contact the in game GM only a few times and on each occasion i have been answered quickly and helpfully. GM Kagorath(sp) has answered my call twice and i thank him very much for his assistance.<BR>We all must remeber that although GM appear to be Gods they in fact are not and are subject to Verant restrictions. I feel very sorry for anyone who does not get a successful conclusion to a problem, perhaps constuctive critisism will help the server GMs to be even better<P>Good luck to you all, may Brell bless and guide you <BR>Syamar Boldheart<BR>Brell Paladin of the 37th circle<BR>Honored member of the Keepers of the Shadows</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Having been with Everquest since it's earliest beginnings. I have seen the good and bad side of CS in E'Ci. However, I have to agree with my esteemed Guildmate Hiwei that things have improved. <P>If I could have an opportunity to make one observation. Although I understand that there is a fine balance between helping a customer who has a legitimate complaint and a customer trying to take advantage of CS to make personal gain, I feel that the policy about replacing lost items, and ressurecting players that died due to something not ment to be "in game".<P>Items and ress's cost Verant nothing in terms of resources. Like many previous GM's have stated, it's just a game, play on. I could equally argue that "it's just a game, please fix the problem."<P>Please dont allow your zeal in keeping the game balanced and unexploited to a level that will allow your GM's and Guides a free'r hand in making these decisions "down in the trenches." They walk among us, who better to make a decision about a players request. Too many times ive had my problems put on hold for a GM or Tech because not enough ability was granted full guides to handle common problems.<P>Thank you for allowing this forum. <P>Play on!! :-)<P>Ancientone<BR>51 Elementalist <BR>E'ci Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR> I agree with the above.  All the GM's try to help best they can.  The full guilds do need to be granted a little more power in fixing every day problems. <BR>  Once I got trapped in a zone on Saturday.  None of the GM's, Guides could help me Had to get Tech Support on Monday to fix this problem.  <BR>  They did their best and tried many different things to help out I.E.  Summon me from zone had me reinstalling files...But none of the efforts paid off.  I would like to thank all that did try and help and  KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think it depends on the GM, and weather they have had a bad day or not. I've spent hours arguing with GM's on issues that shouldn't needed to be argued about, then i've spent seconds talking to certain gm's that are more then happy to help out.  One thing I may note, i've never come into contact with the same GM twice.  I think it may just be luck of the draw when you get a "good" gm compared to a "bad" gm.  In that instance, ask for thier supirior, or the head GM.  Send emails and go through the proper channels.  Eventually either something will get done, it may not be to your liking, but it will be something.  <P>/petition  Why did you do that to me again?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum17&number=17&thisthread=000036&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum17&number=17&thisthread=000036&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
