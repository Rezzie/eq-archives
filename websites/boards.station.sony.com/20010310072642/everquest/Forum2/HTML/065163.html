</FONT><HR>For several months now I have only needed one item to finish my epic weapon.  It is the stone from VS.  <P>I have posted more than once about this subject and am going to post again, but this time I am really pissed, so excuse me if I sound harsh.<P>Look around on any server and you will see that 90% of all Monks, Shamans, Rogues, Enchanters, and Clerics that are level 54+ have Epic weapons. (this is just a guesstament but is based on what I have personally seen) Now look around and see how many of the other classes have epic weapons.  It is more like 10%.  Where is the balance here?  I know that the Shaman epic can be completed in about a week’s worth of time.  The monk epic takes a little longer, but not much.  The Cleric epic is hard but it does have triggered spawns and spawns that are only 2 hours between kills.  I’m not sure about the Enchanter epic, but I sure do see a lot of enchanters running around with that snake.  Now look at the druid epic.  We are forced to camp mobs left and right.  We are forced to sit out on the spires in TD for days upon days waiting for that ugly little dragon to spawn.  We are forced to kill a completely MR Frog that we personally can only do melee damage to.  Then the worst of all is VS. VI in their infinite wisdom has VS on a 7-day spawn timer.  Yes he may spawn up to 24 hours early or 24 hours late but this is a very rare occurrence.  VS is also up when the servers come back up after a reset.  Once again, VI and their wonderful wisdom takes down and then brings the servers back up while the majority of EQ players are at work. This leaves the major mobs like VS, dragons and the Gods wide open to the UBER guilds that are either based overseas or made up of a bunch of college kids that play 24/7. So this leaves the majority of Druids and Rangers sitting on the sidelines waiting till all the UBER guilds are done with him.  Then the Druids and Rangers have to beg the Uber guild to actually kill VS for them and let them loot the stone. I have read that on some servers the UBER guilds are now selling the loot rights to the stone.  This is just rude in my opinion.<P>I am personally to the point that I dread to see the servers come down for a patch. I know that I am going to once again be sitting in Karnors asking to get in on the VS raid and be told "sorry guild only" and know that the UBER guild once again will have another druid/ranger with stones while I sit there not only doubting my guild for not being able to help me (because they all work) but doubting myself for not being able to complete the quest.  <P>PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do something to make these quest more Balanced.  I know that they are supposed to be "EPIC", but it is not balanced if a Cleric/Shaman/Monk/etc can actually set up a raid anytime during the day or night and be able to complete the epic.<P>I hope that somebody with a blue name will read and respond to this.  I know it is a subject that many feel the same way about.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You think you have it tough? Try looking at the mage or necro epic (not that you would want the necro epic)....  <P>At level 49 I know that chances are I will never get my necro epic because of the cloak of spiroc feathers quest (maybe 2 exist on the whole server), and the fact I have to kill both Inny and CT (yea a necro is wanted on a raid).<P>Wah you have to wait for one spawn, yes its annoying, yes the uberguilds farm it, oh wait... I have that problem with 3!!! of the items I need.  The epics are made to be tough, yes it is unfair that so many of the other quests are easier by comparison, but the solution is not to make yours easier, its to make them harder....<P>There should not be 083245083275 epics on a server.<P>Aalavar's .02 worth</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think he is making a plea to balance ALL of the epic quests. This would include Necros and Mages as well. <P>Anyways, I could not agree with this post more. The reward on this item is not worth it to me at this point in time, at level 55. I hate camping with a passion, and it appears Verant thinks camping=hard. Camping does not equal hard, it equals BORING. Why spend days/weeks camping Fay for the epic other than as a status symbol. It has nice wisdom and nice resists (along with every other classes epic) but the effect?? A DoT that gets resisted too much.<P>I may decide to pursue this after I hit level 60. Dunno though, I may just rather spend my time playing an alt than camping Fay for 400 hours.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OK, the VS stone might be a sticking point, but it is fine as it is.  I know it is hard to get it, but seriously...it is supposed to be hard.  VS is a once a week spawn and YES he is farmed, but that makes it all the better because every week a druid and/or ranger is able to get a stone, that means all you have to do is get in on the raid.  VS is by FAR not the hardest part of the druid epic, in my opinion Faydedar is the hardest because he gets killed so shortly after he spawns, this means that maybe one druid every two or three weeks will get the Fay part, while at least four druids get the stone from VS per month.  Think about it...the druid epic involves A LOT of camping and waiting and sitting and solo'ing, but all in all it is not that tough, the only points that we would get stuck on is VS and Fay, and Fay is the sticking point for most of us.<BR>I am definately not saying that the Druid epic is balanced, but the problem is not VS, it is that most of the quest is solo'ing and camping (long hours camping, unbelievably long) easy spawns that are solo'able by any druid 51+ or it is one (and I guess VS) uber spawn that is either farmed every weeks as soon as he is up or never able to be found.<BR>Revamp the Druid epic quest is what I say.  I dont care if they put a 55+ mob in for every 'clensed essence' (so 3), but as long as that mob is able to be found and killed by someone with the number of people needed or if they were trigured spawns and lvl 63, that would still be better then having most of the quest able to be done solo'able and/or with one group and then having the bottleneck of ONE spawn holding up 95% of the Druids.<P>VS is not the bottleneck of the druid epic you think it is...Fay is the bottleneck, on my server alone there are 5 Druids that need Fay, one of them that needs VS as well, but I have gotten a friend a VS stone before simply by asking the guild going to kill VS if they can tag along and loot a stone...they agreed because no druids or rangers in their guild needed the stone.<P>VS is your last peice, if you have tried your hardest and asked to get on every single VS raid in the last month and still no stone, I would look at the guilds you are trying to ask to join...I know for one that the guild I am in would most likely allow you to loot the stone simply because it is your last peice, that is if no one else in the guild was on their last peice.  2 stones per week (not counting server crashes or emergency patches/maintenance) equals 8 stones a month...now it has been about, what, 6 months since the stone for VS was widely known to be for druid/ranger epics...there is most likely one or two guilds on your server that have gotten stones for all of their druids/rangers down to lvl 50 at least...ask a lot of questions and use the 'its my last peice' excuse, hopefully you can get the stone soon.<P>---------<BR>Balise</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>as much as i hate to say it, nothing is wrong with this situation.  these items were created to need a large group to attain. Camping rare spawns, and needing 30+ people to do it is part of the quests.<P>of all, i only have sympathy for magicians. I have had the grace to kill that pegesus twice. once we got the cloak, second time we got the leggings. that was 8 months ago. I spent another 3 months in soutk karana, and never even heard about it being up/killed agian.<P>epic items are for epic players, ie uber guilds, or those well connected to them. it is the reward for playing in such large groups.

</FONT><HR>Well first of all the cleric epic contributes to the raiding party, in minimizing downtime due to cr.  Verant probably wants that to be fairly common, because people were leaving the game due to how boring it was, mainly because of hours of CR for one friggen raid.  The epic doesnt make us any more desirable for exp groups, and a raid only needs one cleric with his epic to minimize downtime.<P>Personally I would like my epic changed from a rez stick to a snare/group evac/or GOOD pet spell.  <P>The rogue is arguably the easiest epic, and it is because rogues simply need the weapon more than others perhaps?  Verant intends them to be the highest damage dealer, because damage is all they are worth. <P>Magician epic is arguably the one that benefits the class the most, maybe on par with rogue weap.  Personally I think its way too hard, I quit my mage at level 55 because I saw no way to get this epic, and without it you basically suck.  <P>The wizard epic I dont understand why its so hard.  They are pretty worthless except for uber encounters in kunark/norrath, so imo the epic should be easy and give them a fairly decent pet or something to make their damage over time (which is sooo important for xp groups) increase.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think she has a point.. Why not balance the issue by putting in side quest that are equally hard and produce the same item (the stone). Just like the rogue has. They can do one of 4 side quest to get any part needed to turn in for the Epic. The rest of the classes have to fight, race or hope they have a great guild without time limitations to get the farmed mobs. Putting any item on VS or Trak for a Epic is very very ignorant in the first place. Why? they are the first mobs taken out when servers come up for the armor.

</FONT><HR>The druid epic is not hard. The druid epic involves endless hours of camping. Druids would instantly have Fay buffed up to level 65 if we could have him be a triggered spawn. We don't want our epic to be easy, but I don't see how camping=hard. And, for the amount of time it takes to invest in the quest, I really don't see the point in doing it (the effect is not all that impressive, IMO)<P>While I take great joy in helping my guildmates get their epics (we have several cleric/rogue/enchanter/and shaman epics) It is pretty disheartening to see how little time it takes in comparison to my own class' epic weapon. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Zaok, the Wiz staff (one of four staffs) for the Wiz epic drops of VS, too. It is much more rare than the stones. So are the Items of Tola, of CT (§$%&) and of Phingy. So, we need for parts for our epic, all harder to get get than those stones.

</FONT><HR>Natan, did you read the original post?  Lemme cut and paste for you again.<P>"Look around on any server and you will see that 90% of all Monks, Shamans, Rogues, Enchanters, and Clerics that are level 54+ have Epic weapons. (this is just a guesstament but is based on what I have personally seen) Now look around and see how many of the other classes have epic weapons. It is more like 10%. Where is the balance here?"<P>Did you somehow feel that Wizards, Mages, and Necros, Bards, SK's ETC. were left out of the "other" classes? Did you bother to read the post at all? He is asking Verant to address why some epics are so easily obtainable, and why others are not. <P>The blatant lack of sympathy and understanding for any class other than the posters own on these boards irritates me. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Before I share with you the details of my mission, however, you must first prove your worthiness. Agreed?<P>You say, 'Agreed'<BR>Kurron Ni says 'Very well then, my new friend. I have an acquaintance that stands in need of three pieces of Darkforge Armor. He requires the breast, greaves and helm to complete his set. I also must pay back a loan that has come due in the amount of 900 platinum. Return this to me and I shall share with you my dark mission, and the immeasurable reward that will be earned at its completion.

You volunteered. By exercising my superior powers of persuasion, I have now taken from you a fine suit of armor and enough coin to ensure that I will be sleeping neither soberly nor alone for quite some time! Now I ask you, worthy shadowknight, do you not feel the fires of hatred coursing through your veins like never before? That is the very reward I spoke of! You have been brought closer to my master. My mission is complete! You foolish excuse for a dark knight, I shall take your head and tell all of your generous donation to the mighty Teir'Dal rogues!<BR>Kurron Ni punches YOU for 200 points of damage.<BR>Kurron Ni glares at you threateningly -- he appears to be quite formidable.<BR>...<BR>You have slain Kurron Ni!<BR>You gain party experience!!<P>Deceased: Kurron Ni - Level 55 rogue - Immune from all spells but disease/poison DoTs and lure line.<BR>Approximate forces required: one 50+ group.<P>You find a Letter to Duriek on his corpse that reads: <P>Duriek, I have searched this godless pit for what seems to be an eternity with nothing to show for my efforts.

In the meanwhile I have run into some unexpected expenses and will need some funds to carry on. An additional ten thousand should suffice.<BR>    Regards, Karnett <P><BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>The New Apprentice<BR>Duriek Bloodpool can be found in Paineel. Hand him the Letter to Duriek you have... found.<P>Duriek Bloodpool says 'Yes, most unfortunate. I was informed last week of the death of my most recent apprentice. A few months ago, I paid a substantial sum to a group of rogues sent from Neriak to collect on a gambling debt. He swore to me that was the end of it, but I suspected otherwise. My warnings of gambling with the rogues fell on deaf ears. Please accept this for your troubles.<BR>Your faction standing with TrueSpirit got better<BR>You gain experience!!<BR>Duriek Bloodpool looks your way apprehensively -- he appears to be quite formidable.<P>Despite what Duriek tells you, you receive neither item nor money.<P>You say, 'What apprentice?'<BR>Duriek Bloodpool says 'As stubborn and foolish as he sometimes was, he was full of potential. Had he managed to achieve my age he doubtless would have surpassed my abilities. Though I am not surprised at his passing, he will be sorely missed. Well, I thank you for your efforts. Feel free to meet me in the tavern for a drink sometime. I must now get to the task of replacing my associate.<P>You say, 'I will replace him'<BR>Duriek Bloodpool says 'Hmm, you seem a bit green and I hesitate to trust you with such an important work, but time is of the essence as my days in this world are running out. Bring me back a bottle of cough elixir and, if you are still interested, I will instruct you further.<P>Head to Neriak Foreign Quarter. Find Smaka.<P>You say, 'hail Smaka'<BR>Smaka says 'You want stuff? Or mebby you looks for a cure?<BR>You say, 'I need a bottle of cough elixir'<BR>Smaka says 'Ahh, you want me cure?! It cost lots of money, big big secret it is. Only us ogres know how to make. You wants? Only 1000 platinum!

Hand the Cough Elixir to Duriek.<P>Duriek Bloodpool says 'Thank you. Now, quickly, there is not much time for me. What I tell you here now must never be shared with another soul. I have spent the better part of my life piecing together clues for the creation of a legendary dark blade, a corrupted Ghoulbane. I am very close to understanding the method used in manipulating the enchantments of the Ghoulbane, but in my current condition, I cannot finish collecting the research. My previous apprentice was searching for this last clue when he met his untimely demise.<BR>Your faction standing with TrueSpirit got better<BR>Duriek Bloodpool looks your way apprehensively -- he appears to be quite formidable.<P>You say, 'where was he searching?'<BR>Duriek Bloodpool says 'I possess a key that will open a sealed tome to be found somewhere in the ruins uncovered here not long ago. Recover that tome for me and I am certain I will be able to corrupt the Ghoulbane. My name will be etched in history and you will wield a legend! You must hurry now, and I must return to my studies. Do not return to me, {your name} , without the tome.<P><BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>More Work<BR>Head to the Hole and find a ratman guard.

It seems I underestimated you. You have succeeded where others failed. I feared it would never come to pass.' Duriek takes the key from his neck, softly muttering some words, and places it in a previously unseen keyhole. The book's hinges creak as Duriek pulls it open. After reading for a few moments, he says, 'It is even better than I had hoped! It will take me weeks to uncover a portion of what this book has to offer. But this is what I have been searching for, so many years! At last I know the items required to corrupt that accursed blade!'<BR>Your faction standing with TrueSpirit got better<BR>Duriek Bloodpool looks your way apprehensively -- he appears to be quite formidable.<P>You say, 'What items?'<BR>Duriek Bloodpool says 'I will need the Ghoulbane, the Soul Leech, the Blade of Abrogation, and the Decrepit Sheath. Alas, I am far too ill to travel and collect these pieces. I must call upon your youth and ability again, {your name} . Return to me with these items and I shall be known throughout history as the greatest grave lord to have walked Norrath and you shall be among the most powerful in our art.<P><BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>The Corruption<BR>The Ghoulbane is in possession of the froglok shin lord in the Ruins of Upper Guk.<P>The Soul Leech, Dark Sword of Blood is in possession of the God of Fear, Cazic-Thule, in the Plane of Fear.<P>The Blade of Abrogation is at times carried by monsters in the Plane of Sky.<P>The Decrepit Sheath is fashioned by Teydar. He is located in the Qeynos Aqueduct System.<P>Teydar looks your way apprehensively -- looks like quite a gamble.<P>You say, 'hail Teydar'<BR>Teydar says 'Hello {your name} , It's good to see another shadowknight. I'm Teydar, I've made it my life to fashion suitable scabbard and sheaths for our order.<P>You say, 'Can you fashion a decrepit sheath?'<BR>Teydar says 'The object you desire is very difficult to fashion, nearly impossible, really. All I can offer to do is try. The real difficulty is the contents that give the sheath its power. They have to be of an almost equal evil. I think some kind of decrepit hide, a drake spine along with a bar of enchanted platinum should prove enough to make this item.<P>Drake Spine can be taken from a drake named Rharzar in Rathe Mountains.<P>Rharzar scowls at you, ready to attack -- it appears to be quite formidable.<BR>Rharzar hits YOU for 288 points of damage.<BR>...<BR>You have slain Rharzar!<BR>You gain party experience!!<P>Deceased: Rharzar - Level 55 cleric - Immune from all magic based spells.<BR>Approximate forces required: two 50+ groups.<P>Decrepit Hide can sometimes be found on the ashenbone drakes in the Plane of Hate.<P>an ashenbone drake scowls at you, ready to attack -- it appears to be quite formidable.<BR>an ashenbone drake hits YOU for 137 points of damage.<BR>...<BR>You have slain an ashenbone drake!<BR>You gain party experience!!<P>Hand the Drake Spine, the Decrepit Hide, and the enchanted platinum bar to Teydar.<P>Teydar says 'I did it! The pieces you got me were perfect! It took a huge effort on my part to craft this, of course. it saddens me that I'm unable to keep one of my best works. A deal is a deal. There is honor among shadowknights.<BR>Your faction standing with Truespirit got better<BR>Teydar looks your way apprehensively -- looks like he would wipe the floor with you!<P>You get a Decrepit Sheath.<P>Head back to Duriek and give him the Ghoulbane, the Soul Leech, Dark Sword of Blood, the Blade of Abrogation, and the Decrepit Sheath.<P>Duriek Bloodpool takes the Ghoulbane and places the other swords on either side of it. The sheath begins to gleam so intensely, you can see the bones inside Duriek's hands. After several minutes, there is a final, blinding flash. Duriek collapses to the ground. After a few moments, Duriek motions you closer and whispers, 'You have done well. I wish fate had been kinder to me and allowed me your aid years ago, I might have lived long enough to enjoy the fame our combined efforts. I studied much of the tome you retrieved and have stumbled upon something that may be the key to unleashing darkness upon the face of Norrath forever. You must seek out a powerful lich by the name of Lhranc. Farewell, {your name}.' With his last bit of energy, Duriek places the corrupted Ghoulbane in your hands.<BR>Your faction standing with TrueSpirit got better<P>You get the Corrupted Ghoulbane.<P>Duriek Bloodpool vanishes (dies.)<P><BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>The Cursed Being<BR>Lhranc is a ghost in the City of Mist.<P>Lhranc looks your way apprehensively -- looks like quite a gamble.<P>You say, 'hail Lhranc'<BR>Lhranc says 'Ahh, finally!

I have been unjustly sentenced to an eternity in this wretched form you see before you, never to leave these walls. In exchange for the cure for this curse, I swear to show you a secret that would make you the most powerful of your kind.<P>You say, 'What is the cure?'<BR>Lhranc says 'I require only four things of you, dark one, and one of them you hold now. Bring me the heart of an innocent, the head of the valiant, and the will of Innoruuk. With these, my curse shall be lifted at last and I will craft a weapon that will cast a shadow over all of Norrath.<P>"one of them you hold" refers to the Corrupted Ghoulbane.<P><BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>The Ritual<BR>In Toxxulia Forest, near the dock, you may find Knarthenne Skurl.<P>You say, 'hail Knarthenne Skurl'<BR>Knarthenne Skurl says 'Ah, you do not possess the heart of an innocent. Be gone with you!<P>You say, 'What heart of an innocent?'<BR>Knarthenne Skurl says 'What's that? Heart of the Innocent, you say?! Ages, it has been, since I was last asked that. The Heart of the Innocent is an item of great power. Few are they who have ever commanded the dark magic of such an object. It is the bound soul of a pure mortal, rare indeed. Take this hollow gem, and combine with it the heart of one who is pure. If your hand is steady and your mind is clear, you shall have what you seek.<P>You get a Soulcase.<P>In Kerra Isle, you may find Marl Kastane.<P>You say, 'hail Marl Kastane'<BR>Marl Kastane says 'Begone!! You do not have the will to do the things I require!<P>You say, 'I have the will of Innoruuk'<BR>Marl Kastane says 'You speak of a myth, friend. Such an object does not exist in this age and the secret of its creation lies locked in my mind, where it shall stay. It has been passed down through generations in my line, not to be revealed to a soul until the prophecy has come to pass.<P>You say, 'What prophecy?'<BR>Marl Kastane says 'My apologies, {Your name} , I have said too much already. Instead, I have an errand to occupy your thoughts. Take this as proof that you are sent from me and find my brother in Paineel. I haven't spoken with him in some time now and his well being is essential to our family's destiny.<P>You get a Seal of Kastane.<P>In Paineel, past the elevator, you may find Gerot Kastane.<P>Gerot Kastane looks your way apprehensively -- he appears to be quite formidable.<BR>Hand the Seal of Kastane to Gerot Kastane.<P>Gerot Kastane says 'At last! I have been waiting for my brother for weeks! We are doomed! Innoruuk will taint our seed into some perverse, twisted, maddened breed. The prophecy has begun to unfold and there are none capable of stopping it. Quickly, return this note to Marl, we must hide! We have failed the master! We must escape the hateful one's wrath!<BR>Your faction standing with Truespirit got better<BR>Gerot Kastane looks your way apprehensively -- he appears to be quite formidable.<P>You get a Note to Marl.<P>You say, 'hail Gerot Kastane'<BR>Gerot Kastane says, '{Your name} ! My hero! I am at your service. I have been told to tell you all I know of the Head of the Valiant. Its construction is a mockery to the gods of Light, an abomination above all others. The method of creation of the Head of the Valiant was passed down through my family for centuries. All I require of you is the physical head of a valiant warrior. I have the rest of the materials right here to fashion this item for you.<P>Head to Kerra Isle and hand the "Note to Marl" to Marl Kastane.<P>Marl Kastane reads the note, eyes widening in panic. He raises his eyes to you and says, 'This is grave news, friend. If the prophecy is allowed to be fulfilled, our strength will vanish into obscurity. Goodness and purity will spread like a plague across the land and the servants of Hate will be powerless to stop it!'<BR>Your faction standing with Truespirit got better<BR>Marl Kastane looks your way apprehensively -- he appears to be quite formidable.<P>You say, 'What prophecy?'<BR>Marl Kastane says 'I suppose it is time for the secret to be shared. Ages ago, two brothers were born. Glohnor was highly favored by the pompous Lightbringer, whose name we do not utter. Lhranc was chosen by the Prince of Hate to bring destruction and turmoil to the sons of men. The one thing they shared in common was their love of the fair priestess, Kyrenna. Kyrenna fell deeply in love with Glohnor. When Lhranc discovered this, he was overcome with rage and unwisely attacked his brother, who happened to be far more adept in combat. The fight cost Lhranc dearly. He lost his dignity as well as an eye in the struggle. He was ordered to leave Freeport and live his life in exile from the only home he had ever known.<P>You say, 'What became of Lhranc?'<BR>Marl Kastane says 'Lhranc wandered the deserts of Ro for weeks, sinking deeper into depression and giving in to rage. Reports from the local merchants and caravans had him roaming the dunes muttering to himself incoherently. Eventually, he was forgotten, blending in with the hermits and madmen common to that region, forgotten by all save one.<P>You say, 'Who is the one?'<BR>Marl Kastane says 'Innoruuk had not forsaken Lhranc. Once his rage and hate had matured and sufficiently altered his soul, the dark prince summoned him and gave him dominion over the demons that had enslaved his mind. He was given a weapon that made him powerful enough to slay any enemy that stood in his way. He was to become the first human to harness the power of the almighty shadowknight. After years of traveling and teaching mankind his newfound abilities, Lhranc sneaked back into Freeport through a series of sewers in search of revenge against his brother and in hopes of kidnapping Kyrenna, the source of his obsession. Waiting until Glohnor was alone, Lhranc sprang from the shadows and slew his brother. This was the act that brought about his curse.<P>You say, 'What curse?'<BR>Marl Kastane says 'As I said, Glohnor was highly favored by the Lightbringer. When the contemptible god of honor discovered what had been done, he transformed Lhranc into a deformed spectral knight and placed him in the ruined city. Lhranc then used what remained of his power to summon Kyrenna to his side and bind her there in a timeless, seamless sphere. He struggled for centuries to break her will and convince her to serve Innoruuk, certain that together they could remove his curse. But then, there was the prediction.<P>You say, 'What prediction?'<BR>Marl Kastane says 'The prophecy states that one day Kyrenna will escape the clutches of Lhranc and that she will resurrect Glohnor. Together, it reads, they will destroy Lhranc and undo all he has done. I trust that I do not need to tell you, {Your name} , that this would decimate our foothold in Norrath. When the prophecy was written, its words spread across the land. A dark council was held to construct a plan that would frustrate the words of the prophets. My ancestors were responsible for robbing Glohnor's tomb and securing his remains. For generations we have been charged with the duty of guarding those remains and the secret plan, should the corpse be discovered.<P>You say, 'What secret plan?'<BR>Marl Kastane says 'The plan is a last resort only to be tried if Kyrenna indeed escapes and the remains are discovered. Judging by my brother's words that time is now. It will take the most powerful hero all the courage and dedication he can muster to complete the ritual.<P>You say, 'I will complete the ritual'<BR>Marl Kastane says 'It would seem we have no choice, and this is our only hope. I must first make a dark shroud. To do this I must stain it with the blood of an innocent. Go find me this rare blood so I can start the creating of the shroud.<P>In the Hole, in a jail cell, you may find Caradon.<P>You say, 'hail Caradon'<BR>Caradon says 'Please help me get out of here! My companion, Kyrenna, and I are trapped in this hellish place!<P>You say, 'Who is Kyrenna?'<BR>Caradon says 'I was with Kyrenna when she attempted to revive the corpse of Glohnor the Valiant. Like fools, we rushed into a trap. Now we sit here and await our deaths.'<P>You say, 'Where is Kyrenna?'<BR>Caradon says 'She is close by. For a price, I shall tell you. Bring me the key to my freedom and I will betray her, who sentenced me to this fate.'<P>In the city area of the Hole you can find mimics.<P>a mimic scowls at you, ready to attack -- it appears to be quite formidable.<BR>a mimic hits YOU for 115 points of damage.<BR>...<BR>You have slain a mimic!<BR>You gain party experience!!<P>Sometimes a mimic will have a Cell Key.<P>Take the Cell Key to Caradon.<P>Caradon says 'Kyrenna!

</FONT><HR>I think it would be nice for Verant to at least address why some are obviously "easier" then others.. I am happy with the druid epic, but I agree... there are some classes that thier epic is so hard it isnt worth doing (or just seems that way to me).<P>A couple things to think about...<P>Should there be more then 26 druids on a server with an epic?  Probably not.. sorry..<P>Should epics be limited to the uber guilds and those who play hours upon hours on end?  Again.. probably.. I dont play enough to ever expect to get an epic for any of my characters and I am realistic about this.  Epics are NOT designed to be common...<P>Basically the only issue here is that it would be nice for Verant to explain why some epics are obviously easier to get then others.  Simple as that..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Sunndew is not talking about the difficultly of the quests at all. None of the epic quests are "easy". Boy,killing Ixiblat Fer(hits for 575 with 300 dmg aoe,and 32k hp) for the cleric epic sure is easy. He is talking about how some of the quests take Luck and patience,not skill. Magicians have to get a ton of rare drops off of rare spawns. It is not "hard" it is just tedious boring and stupid. Killing Venril Sathir means you have to get your whole guild to be on right after a patch and ready to kill him before the other uber guilds. Putting any epic items on a perma-camped 7 day spawn is just stupid,and puts it out of reach to people who are unable to get up at 4 am to kill him. Or for fayader they have to camp a very rare spawn and hope that their guild can stop what they are doing and get over to Timorous Deep before the thing despawns(who's idea was it for this mob that requires a large group of people to depop or be killed after a short time anyway)?<P>The monk,shaman,rogue,enchanter,and cleric epic quests are done more because they do not depend on luck. ALL epic quests should be like these. They have to fight mobs just as hard as the other epic quests,its just those mobs aren't immpossible to get to for 99 percent of the players before they are killed. The cleric epic quest seems to be a great one,since all of their epic mobs are triggered. All of the epic mobs need to be triggered,or not on a long spawn time.<P>The difficulty of the mobs are enough,Epic weapons shouldn't be a sign of who was able to sit in the ocean for 100 hours waiting for a fish and being able to kite it around for a half an hour while help gets there. Or who could get their guild to kill a uber mob at 4am after a patch 20 times to get the rare drop from it. Or who was able to sit in south karana for a month waiting for a flying horse. <P>They should be a sign of who is able to defeat mobs of high difficulty. And who was able to work hard for it.(working is not camping,its doing the interium quests)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I, personally, know nothing of any of the epic quests, aside from my own (Bard), and what I have read from Sunndew's above post. Epic quests are indeed supposed to be difficult, whether it is by spending hours on end waiting for something to spawn, or by killing something difficult that spawns relatively often. Epic quests, however, should not be next to impossible for most people to achieve. Now... regarding VS. Him spawning once a week and not being able to get in on a raid is one thing... an "uber" guild farming him and SELLING loot rights to the epic quest items he drops is completely another, and I know that on Xegony (mine and Sunndew's server) that this DOES happen, not just with VS, but with a LOT of spawns. On Xegony, I have seen ONE Bard with a Singing Short Sword, and only 3 or 4 Druids, but then we have the Shamans.. I've seen 10+ of them with their spears. Sunndew was NOT asking for sympathy, she was saying that it is unfair how a handful of classes can get their epics so much easier than other classes. She was asking for BALANCE, and isn't this game supposed to be balanced?? All of you that mentioned how Druids should stop whining (or even if you thought it), or you thought "oh, its just another Druid, *****ing about how they can't get what they want" and you stop reading... maybe you should go back and read what Sunndew was saying, I mean REALLY read it. I repeat, she was NOT whining, nor was she asking for sympathy.. she was asking for balance with the epic quests.<P><BR>Aadania Nightsong<BR>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You know it kills me to see people calling Druids overpowered.Just because we can solo we're overpowered? Well guess what. It's a good thing we can solo cause we sure can't get a group. People would rather have a Wiz for nukes, a shaman or (obvious choice) cleric for heals, a ranger for snares, and a necro for DoTs. This leaves druids to solo. If druids couldn't solo nobody would play them at all. Sunndew is in the same guild I'm in on Xegony and I have to completely agree with her post. The big bottleneck on Xegony (not speaking for other servers) is VS. There are certain guilds that farm VS. They have people pay to get looting rights on the stone. If nobody pays, they ROT. Something should be done to Ballance ALL the epic quests. Some are ALOT easier than others. All of them should be equal in both time and difficulty to complete. Verant has said that they don't like camping, but druids have to camp the mobd to get thier epic ones to spawn. Having triggered Mobs is the answer. If Fay were triggered or a mob that could drop the VS stone were triggered it would be at least doable. I'm sure there are other ideas as well (both for Druids and the other Classes that have unbalanced quests) so how bout a little less flaming and a little more in the suggestions area. <P>Aluien Shadowstorm<BR>55 Druid<BR>Master Brewer 175<BR>Master Fletcher 187<BR>&lt;CLAW&gt;<BR>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

At absolute least, make the items load more often.<P>Warrior epic: re-goddamn-diculously hard for weapons that aren't even that great<P>Mage epic: up the spawn of the pegasus cloak thingy a tad<P>Necro epic: i know little about this, only that i never have seen it<P>Shaman epic: too easy<P>I'd say along the lines of the Rogue epic or the cleric epic is about right.
