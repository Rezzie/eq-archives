</FONT><HR>Absor said:<BR>&gt; But I can explain why Druid tracking might be getting an increase. It's really the same reason that it was always lower than a Bard's skill before. Before all the cool changes to tracking it was actually better to have a lower skill number than a higher one, unless you had a really high skill. Basically, because there was no scrolling, Bards with their slightly higher skill were actually worse at tracking than druids because the higher skill would create a lot of clutter. This was done at the request of the Druid community.<P>So the plan is to raise the Druid cap so that they are still better at tracking than Bards. That's the plan anyway.&lt;<P>Ok, let's see if I understand this. You wanted druids to be better than bards so you kept their skill lower ... but then for 2 years we had the old interface you had rangers capped higher than bards? <P>Absor, this doesn't make any sense. Can you resolve the contradiction?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I know something that would make clerics happy, give them LoH.  Give necros HT to use on those uber mobs, too.  Oh wait, you wouldn't think of touching paladin's and shadowknight's special abilities, but you hand out the ranger's ability like candy on Halloween.  I don't think druids or bards should have the skill at all, but I know that's not going to happen.  They should each be set to a skill level of 50 or less.  They get the scroll bar now, so it's not like their tracking will be worse, in a practical sense, than it was last week.  Either drop their skill or take away the scroll bar.  RP reasons are irrelevent.  You can point out numerous cases of buffs and nerfs for all classes which go against and RP logic (necromancers not being able to damage against uber mobs, being on example).<P>I can see why clerics are up in arms.  Druids get all kinds of enhancements while clerics get hit with the nerfing stick.  It's not right.  Druids were not a class that was out of balance before.  Why all the changes now?  They don't need it.  They're going to end up being overpowered.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

What the heck is the skill doing?<P><BR>I believe that what he means is that as you get higher levels of skill in tracking it doesn't advance by a factor of 1 for every 1 point of tracking.  More than likely there are stretches of skill increase that you get more or less as you go up in ranking.<P>Note: This does not mean that I'm suggesting that it's ok to give Druids a higher tracking skill.  I still think that it's contradictory to say that Druids (who have been the lowest ranked Trackers since release) were kept low so that they could be better than Bards yet worse than Rangers.  200 Tracking gave us no advantage over anyone for the past two years except knowing if a named spawn had popped at that very second.  Wait too long or come into the zone after the mob had spawned and you would likely never find it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Druids are the main farmers of the game, they are way overpowered, and certainly DO NOT deserve this enhancement.<P>Of course the Druid community is asking for it.  They want all the phat l00ts to themselfs.  Who is farming the spawn in FM, druids, who is farming the spawn in TT, druids, etc etc etc.<P>This last enhancement was great for Rangers, and as a Bard, I would love to have the filters.

</FONT><HR>Well..<P>It is widely accepted that rangers should be the masters of tracking, it is our "class defining" skill (let us disregard the fact that we have to share this defining skill with two other classes...)<P>Before the patch, tracking with a 200 skill was worse than tracking with a lower skill, because you would track stuff half a zone away, but could not track mobs close to you, and as you say yourself, because of all the clutter that would show up. <P>Now as you wish to increase the tracking skill for druids without increasing it for rangers, you are wiping out those invisible lines that makes tracking our "class defining" skill and us the masters of tracking. I do not know what the skill limit for druids on test is set to, but I cannot see that 50 points (assuming it is 150) is much of a difference in what rangers and druids would be able to track.<P>Many rangers have been asking for a true "class defining" skill, such as LoH and DT is for paladins and shadowknights - a once-a-day ability - and I have to say that I agree. If you are going to up tracking for the other classes we share the skill with to the level you have - without upping our skill, you cannot any longer call it the class defining skill of the rangers. <P>Maybe it is time we get a ability that actually is class defining? <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>emedic wrote:<P>"I don't see why a nature priest should track at all."<P>I could not agree more, druids tend to gather together at thier chosen 'divine' spot or act as advisors/leaders to wilderness comunities/clans. They rarely venture away from thier chosen home. It is very rare for a druid to have any tracking ability of his own. Instead they used divination magic or animals to track.<P>Anyhow, whats done is done...the Vision(tm) apparently requires bards & druids to track and that ain't gunna change, so instead of ranting about it i would like to propose a solution i think we can all live with.<P>a) tracking reduces movement speed similar to sneak. Only the very BEST(200+) trackers can actively follow tracks and maintain optimum movement speed. Perhaps a base of 50% movement speed with an extra +5% per 10 skill after 100.<P>b)Limit the amount of mobs to appear in track window based on skill. i would say: Skill / 5. Or make this variable based on skill check success of each tracking attempt. Also perhaps a base of 5+random(5) mobs and keep the current range as is.<P>c) apon selecting a target to track, another skill check is made to determine duration. Or skill checks are make every tick to determine if you can still able to follow your targets trail.<P>d) instead of training each time you hit the 'track' button you have a much reduced chance of training each time a direction message pops up while actively tracking something. This way people train by active use of the skill and not by just hitting the track button repeatedly. Also note that if the tracker is in virtually the same location as he was when the previous message appeared, as in not actively following tracks, no training chance is granted.<P>Class.....Skill...Max movement....Max targets<BR>Ranger....250.....100%............60<BR>Druid.....150.....75%.............40<BR>Bard......100.....50%.............30<P>With these changes a character's tracking ability is a lot more skill based and therefore there is no reason why any tracker can't use the new filters/sort order commands.<P>Give rangers back thier class defining ability!! Every time i hear 'we need a tracker, lets get a druid' i get mad as hell and i'm sure i'm not the only one.<P>Arrolas Lendel<BR>57 Outrider<BR>Torv</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Now, I see all the Nerf the Druid flames and I sit here and wonder....<P>For those of you who have not played a Druid why would you want to make these flames?<P>There are flames that this is the Rangers Class Defining Skill and increasing the Druids Tracking will take away from them.  <P>Lets examine that.<P>Rangers are a Warrior / Druid Hybrid, they get to Melee like warriors and get some nice spells (including Jolt) and most of the spells are druidical in nature, they just get them later than Druids.  Now Druids are the Masters of Nature so why should a Druid not be able to track spawns especially in outdoor areas?  Since Rangers would have been trained by Druids and get most of their abilities from Warriors and Druids I could sit here all day and say that Rangers should be #2 in tracking ability (/em Casts Endure Flames on himself) but I am not.  I could further argue that there is no reason that I can think of for Bards to get tracking at all, but I am not.<P>There are people here stating that Druids are the do all and end all of all classes in Everquest, but having a high level druid that I play let me give you some perspective and things to ponder.<P>We are not invited very often into hunting groups at higher levels unless it is by friends that we have made through out our travels.  How many Rangers and Bards can say this?  What is the Druids Class Defining Skill?  We are at least second best at everything that we do.  Now am I asking Verant to break out the nerf stick and beat all of you with it, No I am Not!!!  <P>What about our use in Epic Raids, we have no use except as fodder to pull Epic Mobs for everyone else to kill, our spells rarely hit Epic Mobs and we sure can not Melee.  Can you say that about Rangers and Bards?<P>As of the last patch I see that Rangers got More Druid Spells Some changes to the Jolt line and their Offense and Weapons Skills were made the same as Warriors, Bards got a new Spell, a change to one Spells and their Defensive Skills raised to the same as Warriors, Druids got Healing Spells along with Shaman to keep up with the increased hitpoints that MOB's have in Velious and Kunark.<P>Here is a quote from Absor<P>"But I can explain why Druid tracking might be getting an increase. It's really the same reason that it was always lower than a Bard's skill before. Before all the cool changes to tracking it was actually better to have a lower skill number than a higher one, unless you had a really high skill. Basically, because there was no scrolling, Bards with their slightly higher skill were actually worse at tracking than druids because the higher skill would create a lot of clutter. This was done at the request of the Druid community.<P>So the plan is to raise the Druid cap so that they are still better at tracking than Bards. That's the plan anyway.   <P>Alan"<P>Now, where in this statement is it stated that Druids are going to even approach Rangers in the ability to Track anything?  It does not!!!  <P>It states that Druids might receive a increase to above Bards level of Tracking as it was always the intention for Druids to be the #2 Trackers.<P>Now, I see Flames about Druids farming things in Frontier Mountains and in other areas, well guess what when you are higher in levels and you can't find a group to hunt with you want to do something to justify paying to play the game and try to have some fun, If I was invited into hunting groups I would rather be getting EXP than trying to solo spawns that other people steal anyways, you see I have seen people that sit in FM and wait for a Druid to run the spawn cycle and run ahead of the druid to see what pops and kill it before the druid can get there and then say that they were there when the MOB pop'd and the Druid better "Play Nice" or they would report him/her for violating the play nice rules!!!  And you might ask how I know this, I have watched it in person and the people who were doing it were now even smart enough to have See Invis up to see me standing right over their shoulders.  Did I report it, No, I did not as I lagged/got booted out of the game just after getting close enough to find out what they were doing and had no proof to prove my point.  I do not cry wolf unless I have concrete proof of what was or is happening. I do not make accusations that I can not back up.<P>The disclamer was posted in Abosr's post "True, this is only on Test right now. And you folks all need to be aware that stuff on Test will not always go live."  So this change may not even go to the Live Servers.<P>Lets use this forum for constructive uses instead of a "NERF THE DRUIDS" forum.<P>Bikkun Wolfen,<BR>Druid of the 51st.

</FONT><HR>It makes sense for a druid to have better tracking than a bard.  As for who has the better skill between druids and rangers?  It's a toss up from a roll play perspective.  But since tracking and archery should be the rangers class specific skill, and archery isn't likely to get much of an upgrade, rangers should be better trackers than druids.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sorry, BikkunWolfen, but that's just a rehash of the same stuff Verant attempts to lay on the EQ community.<P>Druids are not "Masters of Nature." They are SERVANTS of Nature. In this lies the difference. Servants don't know the Master's plans.<P>Rangers are masters of the outdoors. Part caster/part warrior, yes. Less than either of their parent classes, no.<P>As to why Druids might find it hard to get groups at higher levels...perhaps it's simply because they've spent so much time soloing. Many (certainly not all) don't understand the meaning of teamwork; don't understand that the group doesn't simply exist to get them more loot; and have spent too much time gouging their fellow players for hard won cash by charging for simple (although admittedly time-consuming) ports and buffs.<P>I, for one, have never and will never charge for my help, in the form of time or spells. Perhaps if more Druids would take this approach, and stop acting like a bunch of spoiled children rather than the well-endowed class to which they belong, more players would look favorably on them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Greetings,<P>Back in December, I was reading eqcasters, and was really excited with the article at<P>http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=3033<P>It was a preliminary post about tracking changes to come.  The key part was:<P>First, the general changes: <P>The tracking list will default to sorting by distance (closest at the top). <P>The NPC names in the list will be colored the same as their consider color. <P>When you choose a track target you will be sent more frequent updates from the server about the location of your track target. This includes NPCs and PCs. <P>The current /trackplayer command will be made so that it remembers the state when zoning or camping.<BR>There will be a fullview mode window for tracking and it will be global (not requiring Velious). <P>Now the Ranger only stuff: <P>Scroll the list to see everything within the tracking range. <P>Able to change the sorting to be based on consider color, distance, or name. <P>Set the sort order (i.e. farthest at the top vs. closest at the top). <P>Filter the list based on consider color (i.e. don't show greens).<BR>--------------------<P>My level 53 Ranger was really excited by these enhancements.  I am tired of being asked if a critter is on track, and checking, and saying "no, but ask a druid, then ask a bard"<P>I was initially upset to see that bards and druids got scrolling track windows, after hearing that this was to be a Ranger-only enhancement.  I play a high-level druid and bard as well, and have seen that it sure is nice to be able to see more things on track.  I was hoping that the changes would let me outtrack any class.  I was hoping that the Ranger-only enhancements would make the difference, but they are not quite enough to make Rangers the masters of tracking.<P>As it is now, the sorting for Rangers is helpful, but the implementation is not quite complete.  If I am trying to figure out where a named critter is, in a dungeon, it takes several minutes to scroll through the list, and filters won't help.  I can't filter out a /con as the critter could be lost in the soup of 100 greens or 100 blues. <P>What Rangers really need to make them the best trackers is /tracksort1 /tracksort2 and tracksort3.  These would be the criteria to be sorted on.  I want to sort first by /con, then I want an alpha sort on all of the critters of a certain /con, with the closest critters of a type and /con on top.<P>Yes, if you read this, you will see something there -- Alpha as a sort option.  Rangers need to be able to sort with alpha as an option - to group critters of the same type together.  If a Ranger has an alpha sort, they can scan through the track list of 300 critters a lot faster to see if a critter is on track.  I honestly believe this was an oversight when the feature was put in, and it would make a *world* of difference for Rangers.  I am sorry if the feature is in there now, and not exposed in the /tracksort documentation.  This option was mentioned in the post back in Decemeber, and Rangers of the world would love you for putting it in.<P>I want to be able to say:<P>/tracksort1 con<BR>/tracksort2 alpha<BR>/tracksort3 distance<P>The list I see will be very useful, I can see which exp-giving critters are up, and what kinds I have to choose from, and then I can see which is closest.  This will make the Ranger truly the master of tracking.  I can now scan this list really quickly, and start hunting a critter, or tell my group what I see.<P>Sometimes I might want to do:<P>/tracksort1 alpha<BR>/tracksort2 con<BR>/tracksort3 distance<P>If I am after a certain kind of critter for a drop, and would like to see the blues first so I can get exp while I am at it.<P>Having three sort criteria would let the talented Ranger be a great tracker.  I suspect it would not be too hard to implement, and would make a world of difference  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Please make the track list resizable for Rangers, and if possible, add keyboard accelerators for scrolling up and down the track list.<P>I would like the folks who did these great enhancements to Tracking to spend a few minutes with these ideas to make the Ranger really be and enjoy being the master of Tracking.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>In PoF the other night, I saw what my new tracking skill could do.  I could track the entire zone and accurately give everyone a count of all Mobs in zone including pets.  The druids attemped this too, but were much more limited in their findings.  At one point, I probably tracked at least 30% or more Mobs in zone than druids.  This makes me effective, even in the planes... puller asking how many so-and-so's there are in zone and also me reminding him not to miss any of the Tentacle tormentors =P  Please do not lower the gap so much between me and my druid and bard counterparts where the difference doesn't make that big of a difference in the first place.<P>Jareck Thundershot<BR>48th Season Ranger</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The two most powerful changes in tracking are the scroll bar, allowing you to see all targets in your tracking range, and the distance sort, enabling you to find prey that might be in your neighborhood.<P>Given the existence of the scroll bar, the other sorts and filters are tools to make the skill easier to use, but they add no functionality.  All they do is make it easier to pick the name you want out of the list by pushing it to the front page.<P>The only thing that really makes rangers better trackers now is their higher skill.  Raising the skill of druids to over 100 defeats the purpose of the recent changes.<P><BR>I would give:<P>Druid/Bard 75<BR>Ranger 250<P>or give the druids and bards higher skill but not allow them the scroll bar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My tracking distance at 20 was 700 units, and 1000 units at 50 (and linear inbetween).  So the 500 + 10*skill equation does seem to fit.<P>Perhaps he mean that the area covered was not liner.  That definitely is true.  A linear increase in radius results in a much wider area covered.<P>As for Absor's comment about "request of the Druid community," he was referring to the poll taken here a year ago as to what level of tracking Druid tracking should be increased to.  At that time, a large number of druids said don't go beyond 50 or so, because it is better with lower skill level.  So that appears to be the "request" to which he was referring.<P>BTW, Abashi did say at the time that Bards having tracking at 100 was probably a mistake, and that they should be lower than druids (they do get it substantially later, after all).  He also said that they weren't going to nerf bard tracking, and were just going to let it stand.  (And unlike some folks, the druid community at the time didn't call for a nerfing of bard tracking.  I still refuse to play the childish "Bobby got a bigger piece of pie than I did!" game...)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Bikkun: I have no sympathy.<P>Everything you said about Druids having problems post-50 applies equally to Rangers post-50.  We don't have a place in the post-50 raid-oriented game either.  The difference is that Druids (and Necromancers) are VASTLY more powerful than all other classes in the pre-50 game.  That was not true of Rangers, even vis-a-vis other fighter classes once Warriors got some needed upgrades early in the game's history.  (OTOH Rangers may well be overpowered in the pre-50 game following the last patch; the designers may have decided it was easier to break us pre-50 and tell us to bugger off than to fix our post-50 issues.)<P>http://members.home.net/hefferman/EQClips/cougars.jpg<P>EVERY Cougar in this picture is being kited...by the SAME DRUID.  That's obscene.  (I was out there trying to get some Cougar Claw Earrings for myself.  When I saw this, I went to EC and bought them.)<P>You gotta pay the check sometime.<P>As for the Tracking issue, as others have pointed, since the scroll bar was implemented for all classes and not just Rangers, there is simply no room to improve anyone's Tracking without infringing on what is supposed to be the Ranger's class ability.  After having to wait two years to be the best at our own class specialty, it's downright criminal to even TALK about taking away that advantage.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Also sorry for you there emedic since you seem to think that all Druids do it try to take money from people for ports and buffs. <P>While I never charge for Ports or Buffs I will accept donations for the use of my time and hard won mana.<P>By your post it seem as though you have not ever played a Druid.  Try geting a group and while your are fighting you get /tells requesting you to port someone on the other side of the world and when you say that you are busy in a group fighting the people start calling you everything but nice.  Or better yet have the same thing happen with SoW while you are in a fight and poeple come up to your group and ask you for it and when you /tell them that you will do it after the fight and they get all upset that you are not dropping everything that you are doing to help them.<P>Now you want to call Druids a spoiled class what about all the others crying about the Druids.<P>And the thing that I notice most is the lack of courtesy on these boards.  When ever I post I at least put my in game name, level and server, that way anyone who does not believe that I know what I am talking about may visit with me on the server I play on.  Or is it just that people are afraid to post their "Nerf The Druids" posts and then think that Druids will shun them and they will not get ported or buffed.  <P>As you say that most Druids charge for their services, well so do others.  <P>You will always have those that chose to charge for their services it is part of the mentality that Verant has created in their world with the economy the way that it is.  You need PP to get things and how do you get the PP. If I am not fighting creatures to get the PP because I am busy porting a few people around the world how do I get PP.  I have seen almost every class charging for their services (Rangers to Track creatures, Wizards for their Ports, Shaman and Clerics for their Buffs)so the point that you make is not totally valid as other classes do the same thing and yet I don't see you posting that they are cry babies or to Nerf them.<P>The whole point of my post is that flames are coming in saying "Nerf the Druids" on something that Verant always intended to do and now people are up in arms about it, and there is no guarantee that this change will ever go to the live servers.<P>As to the soloing aspect I do solo when I am on and can not find a group, now seeing that I am on the East Coast and I work night shift (mainly 10pm to 6am) when I am on usually in the mornings I usually am at the server low population hours while playing so finding groups is a bit harder for me (I did not say imposible just harder).  But can you blame me for soloing when I do not have a group?  I still pay for the game like everyone else and should be able to enjoy it when ever I am on.  <P>If you get a chance come to the Saryrn Server in the mornings, usually after 7am and say Hi.<P>Bikkun Wolfen<BR>Druid of the 51st. Ring on the Tree of Life<BR>Saryrn<P>By the way there emedic if your station name is close to your profession we are in some what similar lines of work :-) <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Venture: <P>After seeing your link Picture all I can say is that I do not agree with what I see there.  Let me rephrase that I do not like seeing that kind of thing it gives Druids a bad name, I do not quad kite and only take what spawns are available to me.  I wish that Verant would Nerf Quad Kiting, it is done by few but the few that do it give us all a bad name, and leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  I do not want to be an Uber Druid, I am not uber in any way, I do both Group and Solo hunting so I see the best of both worlds and yet I am not here asking for the world I am just following up on some statements made by Verant and Flames by other Players. <P>I do not care if they increase tracking right now My tracking is good enough for me I was just pointing out that Verant had always intended us to be the #2 trackers and now we are not.<P>Bikkun Wolfen<BR>Druid of the 51st.

</FONT><HR>If Verant always intended that Druids should have better tracking then Bards, then why is it Bards have had a higher skill since day 1 ??<P>Why didn't Verant say, oops sorry Tracking has always been broken, and Druids have always had better tracking until now.  I think we should improve druid tracking so they can continue to camp for Phat lutz.<P>Sorry, but this is bull.
