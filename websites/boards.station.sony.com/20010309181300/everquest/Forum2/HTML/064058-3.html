</FONT><HR>&gt; You should re-read the thread. Drazekius began<BR>&gt; the flames, and I have not addressed<BR>&gt; anything other than ideas and behaviors, unlike <BR>&gt; those you defend. You still fail to distinguish<BR>&gt; between the ideas and the person, which explains <BR>&gt; both your hypersensitivity and your inability to <BR>&gt; see which behaviors are allowed under the rules, <BR>&gt; and which not.<BR>&gt; Try harder. Look at the differences between what <BR>&gt; is allowed and what not; you'll see the pattern <BR>&gt; eventually.<P>Thanks for the continued insults. I do honestly appreciate them.  I'm including your first few posts to show you what I meant. NONE of THEM address the taking a break and how it changes your viewpoint. THEY are ALL INSULTS, including the very insulting GQLLFM.  They are also flames back at what you perceive as flames, making them no better than what you are lashing out at.  Why am I listing all this, so that I have it one place so that I can also forward it to the authorities on these boards. We SHOULDN'T have to endure your attacks. I recomment everyone else do likewise and contact Verant that is tired of this garbage.<P>Bloodsage Post 1:<BR>Anything that needs a built-in excuse up front <BR>isn't really worth arguing with; it's already<BR>admitted defeat.<BR>GQLLFM.<P>Bloodsage Post 2:<BR>Ah, last resort of those lacking the<BR>self-discipline to quit by themselves: flame<BR>others in a lame effort to be banned.<BR>The lame virtual equivalent of "suicide by cop."<BR>You chose to characterize anyone who might take<BR>issue with your self-pitying sour grapes as a VAK. <BR>. .pre-emptively. Sure sign of a weak argument<BR>backed by shaky self-esteem.<BR>Don't throw stones unless you're ready to be<BR>bopped yourself.<P>Bloodsage Post 3:<BR>Sorry, but this isn't _your_ thread; it's a public<BR>discussion.<BR>And I choose to take issue with your immature<BR>characterization of anyone who might disagree with <BR>you as a VAK.<BR>Don't post your ideas in public if you can't<BR>handle disagreement. And don't preemptively<BR>insult people if you want a polite discussion.<P>Bloodsage Post 4:<BR>So. . .you've discovered Truth, and it's all<BR>Verant's fault you don't enjoy the game anymore. . <BR>.and anyone who disagrees with you is a VAK<BR>spouting propaganda.<BR>That about sum up your alleged insight?<BR>Had you wanted a flame-free post, you shouldn't<BR>have flamed from the start.<P>Bloodsage Post 5:<BR>I'm quite aware of both the meaning and origin of<BR>the phrase "sour grapes." And I used it correctly,<BR>as well as intentionally.<BR>Do you have any other pearls of wisdom to share?<P>It was Post 6, before you stated a fact and didn't land an insult. It was further even after that before you addressed the topic of the message.<P>You aren't our parent. It's not your right to tell us for how we decide to post. It's not your right to judge us if we're worthy or if we've been insulting to Verant by your standards. That's Verant's job.<P>Now I must go forward this to the appropriate people. I'll take my leave of these boards, because I'm tired of being torn apart by customers and Verant not doing anything about it. I don't pay for that. The ONLY person I need to answer to in my postings is Verant. Only Verant decides if I've gone too far in how a post is.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Grimstaff:<P>You've kept the streak alive: WTG.  Your dodges of the issues, however, are rather blatant, as is your single-mindedly ad hominem focus.<P>I read English quite well, thank you.  As a matter of fact, had you read my posts as closely as you claimed to have during your earlier attempts to psychoanalyze me, you'd realize I have a Master's degree in the subject.  But don't let the facts stand in the way of a good cop-out, by all means.<P>Straithlin:<P>Nowhere did I insult you, or step beyond what is allowed on these boards.  Directing you to re-read something you've obviously misunderstood and perhaps willfully misconstrued is hardly a personal attack.<P>But your continued attempts to have me banned, and to rally others to the cause, are.<P>If you want to suggest something to the moderator, it is generally accepted form simply to e-mail the thread URL and let him make his own decisions.  Attempting to collect posts out of context will just make you appear vindictive.<P>And you still fail to see that Drakezius set the tone by calling anyone who might disagree with him a VAK or a troll.  Why aren't you reporting him, hmmm?<P>If you are so sensitive to disagreement, perhaps you should attempt to be a little more civil in your approach.  You might be surprised how others' approaches to you change.<P>I see nothing at all wrong with defending myself from these attacks begun by Drakezius and continued by Grimstaff and his merry band.  Unlike Absor, I'm not paid to put up with it.  My first post was not, in fact, a personal attack upon Drakezius, but simply taking issue with his preemptive insults.<P>You really think Auric hasn't read this thread, when others are being locked all around it?  Have some integrity, and simply send him the link, if you feel you must, but don't attempt to quote me out of context--I, at least, think he's smart enough to see right through that.  And leave off the rallying others to have me banned: that _is_ against the rules.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&lt;&lt;Drake: I think you've got a problem. What it is, I'm not sure. False expectations are hard to overcome. Here's what I mean:<BR>"3. Justification of my time spent playing, is difficult, as i have spent a long time playing Everquest just to get nowhere in game."<P>Where were you trying to get? As this is a "game", I can't imagine getting anywhere. Did you enjoy yourself? If so, then why are you complaining? If not, why did you play in the first place.&gt;&gt;<P>This is a game... and most games do have a point... beating the game.  However, this is modeled after Role-Playing Games which do NOT have a point, other than to have fun.  Sure, some people put artifical 'endings' into games, but the game really hasn't ended... it just continues with different actors and actresses playing different parts in a different setting and time.<P>Yes, I do feel Verant has screwed up in many things over the past few months, but take a look at what they're doing.  Absor has said they're looking at the Velious encounters... and possibly re-tuning, etc...among many other things. <P>While EQ isn't what I wish it could be... (a truly dynamic world which really changes from week to week at least)... I do enjoy what it is right now for the exploration and such.

I'm not out to get anyone banned, I am out for civility on these boards, especially between customers. That is what I want fixed. Fix the rules they are broke. That will stop individuals like you who just want to come and debate and get their little digs in on us who wish to give feedback to Verant.

Not that they would of, but the insults and flaming guarantee it never will be.<P>I'm still amazed that Verant will allow such to happen. All they are doing is punishing the initial poster based on the actions of others.<P>Drak, we're with ya man.

</FONT><HR>Straithlin,<P>Actually, looking around, it seems there are as many who agree with me as don't.  Nor was it me who turned this into a debate about me.<P>These boards most certainly are for debate and discussion.  That's the whole point.  Were they to function as you state, Straithlin, there'd be no need for a Reply function, would there?  In fact, Verant could simply have an e-mail link to accomplish the purpose you state.<P>Having players debate the merits of various ideas is a good thing.  It shows Verant not only the strengths and weaknesses of any given idea, but it shows the relative popularity as well.  Though the latter is of secondary concern, at best, to the health of the game.  By rationally discussing ideas, we perform a service for Verant, and make EQ better in the process.<P>Except when people cease discussing ideas on their own merits, and begin indicting the company.  Or when people who've screwed up their personal priorities come here blaming Verant.  Or when hypersensitive types mewl, "Can't we all just get along?  Why does there have to be debate?  If you disagree with something, just move on; support others or be silent."  Each of those things is destructive to the meaningful exchange of ideas.<P>Verant has tried very hard, over the years, to have a meaningful exchange of ideas with the playerbase.  But the players have grown so emotionally entagled in their niches that the relationship has soured.  A blue name cannot toss out an idea for comment, because there will be 50 whining children posting the next day, who claim they were promised something.  Day after that, another 50 will claim EQ will be ruined if the suggested changes are implemented.  Look no further than your fellow posters to find the cause of tense relations between Verant and the players.<P>There would be no point, as I said, to having a message board, if debate and exchange were not encouraged.  If you are too delicate to handle that, then present your suggestions to Verant via e-mail, where comment is not possible.  Otherwise, do what everyone else does, and defend your ideas without taking the debate personally.<P>BTW, I re-read your little compendium of out-of-context Bloodsage quotations.  All of what you characterize as "personal attack" are simply addressing the demonstrated behavior and stated ideas of the person to whom I was speaking.  Nice try, though.  Perhaps you should turn that sensitivity on those who _have_ blatantly flamed and insulted others in this thread, rather than those with whom you simply disagree.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Im thinking i should rename this thread:<BR>"Bloodspot flames everyone"<BR>or something like that.<P>he claims we do not adress HIS issues, but he has yet to address the posts.<P>#1.) Verant is making the game harder to play by means of constant, unending nerfs to core class abilities and fundamental stratagies after years of stability.<P>#2.) For every 1 "positive nerf", it is quickly followed by hoards of "negative nerfs". This action sets a bad image and leaves a distateful residue in our mouths.<P>#3.) Soloability is being successively removed from this game. The box said "Massively Multiplayer Online Game". MMORPG can not in any way shape or form be defined as "You need to group or you will die". This means that those of us who originally bought this game under good pretenses are now having the game changed into something we cannot enjoy or even play any longer because we cannot devote our lives to it. in Short, No Soloability = Bad.<P>Now, please Bloodspot, refute and display a long line on nonsensical gibberish about how you are so much more superiour to us, those of us that think this, and then wall yourself in, saying "you dont like me cause i dont agree with you."<P>or, you could offer a change od pace and give us solid reasoning and substansiated facts about how you do not believe my points are valid.<P>Oh, wait... you would just rather type "GQLLFM" then wouldnt you?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Thx more drivel.<P>BS (suitable intials) - re-read your posts. In almost every case you are not arguing the substance of the original post, or any in game ideas. You are simply attacking the way people are presenting their ideas and it's getting old. I see you make these long-winded posts entirely about how people present their ideas. There is absolutely nothing constructive or useful (barring padding your already inflated ego) in that. Using the "exchange of ideas" as justification for what you do is weak. What you usually argue bears no relevance on anything related to this game.<P>Typical BloodSage post:<P>1st reply: Make a controversial statement or disagree with the topic in a confrontational manner.<P>2nd - 999th reply: Write 1000 words, half of which were 10 letters longer than necessary, to simply tell the other person they don't know how to argue and should go away until they do. Mind you, I'm not here to attack your articulation but as a personal opinion you lay it on way too thick sometimes.<P>It impresses very few, but you already knew that.<P>I think you accomplished your goal, though. I doubt we'll see any more posts on the original subject. Thanks, you sure did your part for the "exchange of ideas" thing you keep latching onto.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Drakezius:<P>I addressed those points on page one.  The constant adjustments to the game are what have made it viable for so long.  Read the rest if you want more detail.<P>Straithlin:<P>There are distinct differences between these three statments:<P>"He is silly."<P>"He did something silly."<P>"That is a silly idea."<P>Only the first addresses the person, and is therefore against the rules.  It is quite fair game to address the manner in which something is done--it's what you're doing, is it not?<P>That's the whole point: stating one has gained some insight into EQ and beginning discussion on the topic is quite different than claiming to have discovered Truth, and stating up front that anyone who disagrees is a VAK or a troll.  Similar concepts, but differing in execution.<P>A perfectly valid topic for discussion.<P>And Drakezius, Grimstaff, and the rest of the horde are the ones who've derailed the post; I merely choose to respond to their attacks.  Which began from the first, BTW.<P>So, if you feel you've got Truth, Justice, and the American Way on your side, send your little message to the moderator.  But lay off the self-righteousness, because your grasp of the rules seems tenuous, at best.

I've been posting here since September, but I've never known why. It's been bothering me. I appreciate you clearing up the mystery, and revealing the deep inner motivations that make me tick.<P>You must run a very successful psychic hotline.<P>There was nothing wrong with the original post as a personal statement. By claiming to be the One Truth, and preemptively labeling anyone who might disagree a VAK, troll, or, later, addicted moron, it crossed the boundary from personal opinion to dogmatic assertion.<P>It's upon that point that reasonable people take issue.<P>Perhaps if some of you rabid Verant-bashers would take personal responsibility for your feelings and your conduct, rather than trying to make everything someone else's fault, there would be no need for Auric's crackdown. Verant doesn't cause your feelings, _you_ do. If you're no longer having fun, the reasonable thing to do is to take your bi-weekly McDonald's Quarter Pounder Value Meal's worth of fee and go do something you do enjoy. Not to whine and cry and moan that Verant is somehow at fault for not building a game that meets your personal specifications.<P>It's their world, their vision, and their game. By any reasonable metric, they are wildly successful. Be glad you've been invited to participate in this historic endeavor, and leave quietly when you're no longer having fun. If you feel strongly that you have suggestions how to improve the experience for those who follow you, then send them a letter explaining ways to improve.<P>Not a letter blaming them for your time away from your family, or claiming that they're stupid or incompetent or uncaring for making the changes they have. Those are patently untrue.<P>The fact is, these changes that have all the whiners up in arms are what has kept EQ viable for so long. No other online venture even comes close. They've obviously learned the lessons UO failed, and kept the challenge up. AC, attempting to cater to the EQ dissatisfaction, has not done anywhere near as well.<P>Like it or not, Verant is, by definition, doing the right things.<P>Most of these, "I'm leaving because Verant has spoiled by fun by making me need X to progress," totally miss the point of playing the game. No one but you makes you need X ph4t 1ew+ to proceed or to have fun. <P>"But my friends won't group with me if I don't do that!" the chorus exclaims. Then they're not very good friends, are they? <P>"But I can't do that cool dungeon if I don't level like crazy!" the backup singer lament. Who said everyone, on every personal schedule, will be able to do all and see all in EQ? That would kind of defeat the point of appealing to a wide range of interests and talents and schedules, now wouldn't it?<P>"But little Billy has stuff I don't!" cries the wanna-be powergamer. So what. If your fun is directly tied into competing with others, you'd be better off in Quake III Arena, where you can go head-to-head with others.<P>But quit whining that it's somehow Verant's fault your expectations don't match your abilities or schedule. It's not; it's yours. Had you set expectations in line with your ability or schedule, you'd have no issues; you'd simply play until you were no longer having fun, and leave. Because it's a game, not a competition; it's only purpose is to provide a pleasant diversion from reality for the time you immerse yourself in it. Making it anything else is a personal problem driven by lack of perspective and self-discipline, rather than a plot by the evil corporation to ensnare you and waste your time. You have all the power: at any time, you can take your money elsewhere, with no notice and no consequences.<P>So quit with the piteous mewling, already. It's both tiresome and undignified. And based upon patent falsehood and scapegoating. You are responsible for your own fun, and you have the power to stay, leave, have fun, or be bored.<P>As Milton said, "The mind is its own place / And can make a hell of heav'n, or a heav'n of hell."<P>Neener<P>Bloodsage<BR>Station Member   posted 03-04-2001 08:09 AM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>&lt;&lt;My personal suspicion is that Verant employees have freer reign in how they post and what they say.&gt;&gt;<P>Are you implying that anyone who doesn't share your views must work for the company, Grimstaff? <P>That's petty, shallow, and unsubstantiated, is it not?

Your accusations are simply that, and not even based in fact. First, you claim there's a conspiracy to have Verant employees post here in their defense--and be exempt, somehow, from the rules--as explanation for any opinion that differs from yours. Then you resort to direct attack upon the person, while still ignoring any of the ideas presented. The fact that I'm involved in at least three threads on the front page, at this moment, that belie your ignorance of my habits here seems not to deter your ridiculous assumptions.<P>And your continued sidestepping of the subject of this thread.<P>If you've nothing to say on-topic, here, other than to imply anyone who disagrees with you is somehow evil, I suggest you quietly take your place with Drak and the others amongst the thoughtless whiners and bashers unable to carry on a conversation without resorting to ad hominem reasoning.<P>Otherwise, please discuss, if you can, the ideas presented in this thread, rather than the people.<BR> <BR>________________________________________<P>Hmmm no addressing of the issues this thread presented regarding the playability of EQ in THOSE posts... but wait... maybe you meant the SECOND page, not the first is where you addressed this post's concerns?<BR>________________________________________<P>Bloodsage<BR>Station Member   posted 03-04-2001 08:52 AM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Grimstaff,<BR>You are still clueless, aren't you?

For someone who claims to know me based upon my posts, you seem not to have read any of them closely.<P>And you yet continue to discuss personalities rather than ideas. . .despite your claims that it's a bad thing (when others do it, presumably).<P>Read the original post. It was not simply the musings of someone who's taken some time to reflect upon Life. It is a rather blatant attempt to blame Verant for his lack of self-discipline and skewed personal priorities. And it ends with the disclaimer--that you seem to use, also--that anyone who disagrees is a VAK or a troll.<P>Nice way to start a conversation, no?<P>Have you anything at all to say regarding ideas, concepts, the actual topic of this thread? You claimed that, had I or anyone else actually had the discipline to quit for a couple of weeks, we'd agree with Drakezius. I showed you that's not the case. And your only rejoinder is to imply that I must be lying about who I am, and be an undercover agent for Verant Interactive who is allowed to operate outside the rules here?<P>Why is it that anyone who disagrees with you, and argues from a consistent philosophical basis--correctly identified by Cloudrider--must be part of a grand conspiracy by Verant to undermine your small band of free-thinking heroes fighting oppression and evil?<P>'Splain, Lucy.<BR> <P>Bloodsage<BR>Station Member   posted 03-04-2001 01:39 PM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Thuriniel,<BR>Do you not read?<P>Look at my post earlier on this page: I routinely take weeks or months off of EQ due to RL considerations. Perhaps that's why I'm _not_ angry at Verant: I've got the perspective to realize I have all the power, because I can take my business elsewhere anytime I choose.<P>Therefore, I simply enjoy the game as they present it, until the point I'm no longer having fun, then I'll quit.<P>Easy.<P>Perhaps some of the zealots attempting to remake EQ in their own images will get the clue.<BR> <P>Bloodsage<BR>Station Member   posted 03-04-2001 03:00 PM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>You should ask yourself that question, Grimstaff, as it is you who's characterized anyone who disagrees with you as a VAK, troll, or Verant employee. . .not to mention intimating that I'm a liar, though you claim to have perused my posts in enough depth to characterize me, personally, without seeming to have actually absorbed any of the details or patterns.<BR>I see you folks as zealots because you've latched onto the idea that you've got the answers, while no one else is allowed a differing opinion. Just look at your posts to this thread, as well as the original. Every time you post, you imply that anyone who hasn't reached the same conclusion you have is defective.<P>Had you, or Drazekius, for that matter, been interested in meaningful dialogue to improve the game, you'd have left off the nonsense and preemptive namecalling.<P>_That_ is what I object to.<P> <BR>Bloodsage<BR>Station Member   posted 03-04-2001 03:31 PM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>&lt;&lt;My personal suspicion is that Verant employees have freer reign in how they post and what they say.&gt;&gt;<BR>Here, along with your other comments along these lines, are where you imply anyone who disagrees with you must be an employee of Verant. You've brought this up--with absolutely no supporting evidence--several times.<P>&lt;&lt;Incidentally if you took 2 weeks off you'd come to the same conclusion about the game he did, all of you.&gt;&gt;<P>Here is where you imply you have the One Truth, and attempt to shut off debate. I notice you've completely ignored my rebuttal on this point.<P>Nowhere did I call anyone a VAK. Actually, the people you are defending as gurus of truth and tranquility are the ones who've used it to characterize anyone who disagrees with them. Read the original post: it explicitly states that anyone who comes here with a differing opinion is a VAK or a troll.<P>And, if you'd bother to read your posts, you'd find that each and every one ignores the issue at hand in favor of an ad hominem argument. Not once have you argued the merits of blaming Verant for becoming bored with the game, or for having skewed personal priorities. You simply assert that all right-thinking individuals agree with you, and begin to postulate bizarre theories (everyone else is either a VI employee, or hasn't taken time off to reflect) to explain away the disagreement without addressing the issues.<P>Drazekius is the one who first chose to flame. You are the one who's made personality an issue, though you've botched it rather badly.<P>When are you going to discuss the topic at hand?<BR> <P>Bloodsage<BR>Station Member   posted 03-04-2001 03:47 PM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Thuriniel,<BR>You're a licensed psychiatrist in which state? Please explain your diagnosis, doctor.<P>I find it rather interesting that no one has bothered to address the actual ideas I've presented refuting Drazekius' rather self-indulgent little rant, though many of you seem to think you're qualified to explain my behavior to me.<P>If you're so good, then why not show me where I err?<BR> <P>Bloodsage<BR>Station Member   posted 03-04-2001 04:39 PM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Grimstaff:<BR>Are you aiming to set a record for the longest string of ad hominem posts in board history?<P>In your quotation, you say it is a suspicion that Verant employees are posting here anonymously in an attempt to skew things, but go no further. In your explanation, you say you are stating facts, and that anyone with wit would see it. You choose to characterize my motivation and ability rather than address anything I've said. Prove your point, rather than assert it.<P>Perhaps it is you who should learn logic and debate.<P>I've addressed each of your points, yet you've addressed none of mine; you simply create more bizarre speculations as to my personal life. Which is worse than saying nothing, because it tacitly admits to having nothing relevant to add.<P>Still waiting for you to say anything on topic, rather than fantasizing about my life--which is rather strange in itself.<P>Straithlin:<P>You should re-read the thread. Drazekius began the flames, and I have not addressed anything other than ideas and behaviors, unlike those you defend. You still fail to distinguish between the ideas and the person, which explains both your hypersensitivity and your inability to see which behaviors are allowed under the rules, and which not.<P>Try harder. Look at the differences between what is allowed and what not; you'll see the pattern eventually.<P> <BR>Bloodsage<BR>Station Member   posted 03-04-2001 04:52 PM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>^<BR>|<BR>|<BR>|<BR>Just doesn't get it. <P><BR>________________________________________<P>Hmmm not there either... maybe you meant the THIRD page? lets take a look-see...<BR>________________________________________<P>Bloodsage<BR>Station Member   posted 03-04-2001 05:10 PM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Grimstaff:<BR>You've kept the streak alive: WTG.

But don't let the facts stand in the way of a good cop-out, by all means.<P>Straithlin:<P>Nowhere did I insult you, or step beyond what is allowed on these boards. Directing you to re-read something you've obviously misunderstood and perhaps willfully misconstrued is hardly a personal attack.<P>But your continued attempts to have me banned, and to rally others to the cause, are.<P>If you want to suggest something to the moderator, it is generally accepted form simply to e-mail the thread URL and let him make his own decisions. Attempting to collect posts out of context will just make you appear vindictive.<P>And you still fail to see that Drakezius set the tone by calling anyone who might disagree with him a VAK or a troll. Why aren't you reporting him, hmmm?<P>If you are so sensitive to disagreement, perhaps you should attempt to be a little more civil in your approach. You might be surprised how others' approaches to you change.<P>I see nothing at all wrong with defending myself from these attacks begun by Drakezius and continued by Grimstaff and his merry band. Unlike Absor, I'm not paid to put up with it. My first post was not, in fact, a personal attack upon Drakezius, but simply taking issue with his preemptive insults.<P>You really think Auric hasn't read this thread, when others are being locked all around it? Have some integrity, and simply send him the link, if you feel you must, but don't attempt to quote me out of context--I, at least, think he's smart enough to see right through that. And leave off the rallying others to have me banned: that _is_ against the rules.<BR> <P>Bloodsage<BR>Station Member   posted 03-04-2001 05:52 PM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Straithlin,<BR>You have a mouse in your pocket?<BR>.<BR>.<BR>.<BR>.<BR>.<BR>.<BR>.<BR>.<BR>.<BR>.<BR>Then who is "we?"<P>I'm not going to pamper you simply because you construe any suggestion that you may be mistaken as a mortal insult. This isn't a love-in, and if you can't defend your ideas or handle disagreement without being offended at the mere suggestion you should look deeper than your initial prejudices allow, then you'd probably be better off at Mattel's web site. <P>Try www.barbie.com, it's nice and soothing there.<P>Otherwise, quit whining about being told you're wrong, and start defending your point, if you have one.<P>Please<BR> <P>Bloodsage<BR>Station Member   posted 03-04-2001 06:18 PM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Straithlin,<BR>Actually, looking around, it seems there are as many who agree with me as don't. Nor was it me who turned this into a debate about me.<P>These boards most certainly are for debate and discussion. That's the whole point. Were they to function as you state, Straithlin, there'd be no need for a Reply function, would there? In fact, Verant could simply have an e-mail link to accomplish the purpose you state.<P>Having players debate the merits of various ideas is a good thing. It shows Verant not only the strengths and weaknesses of any given idea, but it shows the relative popularity as well. Though the latter is of secondary concern, at best, to the health of the game. By rationally discussing ideas, we perform a service for Verant, and make EQ better in the process.<P>Except when people cease discussing ideas on their own merits, and begin indicting the company. Or when people who've screwed up their personal priorities come here blaming Verant. Or when hypersensitive types mewl, "Can't we all just get along? Why does there have to be debate? If you disagree with something, just move on; support others or be silent." Each of those things is destructive to the meaningful exchange of ideas.<P>Verant has tried very hard, over the years, to have a meaningful exchange of ideas with the playerbase. But the players have grown so emotionally entagled in their niches that the relationship has soured. A blue name cannot toss out an idea for comment, because there will be 50 whining children posting the next day, who claim they were promised something. Day after that, another 50 will claim EQ will be ruined if the suggested changes are implemented. Look no further than your fellow posters to find the cause of tense relations between Verant and the players.<P>There would be no point, as I said, to having a message board, if debate and exchange were not encouraged. If you are too delicate to handle that, then present your suggestions to Verant via e-mail, where comment is not possible. Otherwise, do what everyone else does, and defend your ideas without taking the debate personally.<P>BTW, I re-read your little compendium of out-of-context Bloodsage quotations. All of what you characterize as "personal attack" are simply addressing the demonstrated behavior and stated ideas of the person to whom I was speaking. Nice try, though. Perhaps you should turn that sensitivity on those who _have_ blatantly flamed and insulted others in this thread, rather than those with whom you simply disagree.<BR> <P>Bloodsage<BR>Station Member   posted 03-04-2001 06:48 PM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Drakezius:<BR>I addressed those points on page one. The constant adjustments to the game are what have made it viable for so long. Read the rest if you want more detail.<P>Straithlin:<P>There are distinct differences between these three statments:<P>"He is silly."<P>"He did something silly."<P>"That is a silly idea."<P>Only the first addresses the person, and is therefore against the rules. It is quite fair game to address the manner in which something is done--it's what you're doing, is it not?<P>That's the whole point: stating one has gained some insight into EQ and beginning discussion on the topic is quite different than claiming to have discovered Truth, and stating up front that anyone who disagrees is a VAK or a troll. Similar concepts, but differing in execution.<P>A perfectly valid topic for discussion.<P>And Drakezius, Grimstaff, and the rest of the horde are the ones who've derailed the post; I merely choose to respond to their attacks. Which began from the first, BTW.<P>So, if you feel you've got Truth, Justice, and the American Way on your side, send your little message to the moderator. But lay off the self-righteousness, because your grasp of the rules seems tenuous, at best. I hope my examples help.<P>_____________________________________________<BR>_____________________________________________<BR>_____________________________________________<P><BR>Sooo.... i kinda missed where you were adressing the intent and purpose of this post...<P>Was it in there? does anyone else see it?<P>What i see is a lot of bashing, flaming, and accusing others of being mean, totally disregarding the fact that he is doing exactly what he claims others are doing to him, and yrlling "sanctuary" and "self defense" to dodge the ban-stick.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I'm willing to bet Absor has no official restrictions on what he is allowed to post beyond common sense guidelines(Profanity, Vulgarity).  However there is pressure, whether slight or great I do not know, to make sure his posts don't get him fired.

Then they should have posted their positive comments to the existing thread, and not bumped another while closing every other one around it.<P>Verant is above the law, it's their game. However, that doesn't mean they need to flaunt it. They can live just as well within the rules they expect of their customers, be it in posting, or in names of their guides/GMs. It's leading by example, and not leading by ordering. And as we are free customers, they'll win a lot more points and customers by leading by example, than saying: "Do as I say, and not as I do".  Save breaking of their own rules for extreme cases, and not practice the breaking of them on a daily/ongoing basis.
