</FONT><HR>Ok guys, and girls, and whatever else...Rogues are undoubtly the indisputible king of damage.  In a good group with just one cleric, and an enchanter, the rogue can just sit there and backstab the crao out of the mob, causing more damage than any other melee class.  Hell they could even go through mobs faster than a group that was nuker heavy.  Add working poison to that, and there is no choice but to make a nod to the rogue.  So they are group dependent, get over it, if you dont like go play a necro or something.  I for one am happy with my rogue, I just wish there were more quests and things like that.  Oh and for thoughs of you who want are class to be more realistic, when was the last time you saw elemental beings walking down the street, or dragons flying throught the air, or demons, ect.  The game is a fantasy nor reality so get over it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Aye, the rogue CAN be king of damage. It all depends on equipment. however, the MONK can do mega damage with his hands alone.<P>In order to get that mouth watering 300pt backstab you must either have planes weapons (bone razor, shrieking ahlspiess), dragon weapons (crys spear) , or Kedge weapons (gloomwater). All mega tough to get. howeve, a monk comes out swinging with his bare hands and natural fast attacks.<P>Also, poison is good now, but only when you first get it. I mean at level 20 a 200 point DoT is awesome, but standing at level 34 the only use I have found is poisoning for PvP/duels. In order for the poison to be effectiove, it must last long, meaning you need APPLY POISON skill. However, making a vial of poison costs a few platinum itself, and with a skill increase every few levels it is hard to get good at it. <P>Jewelers can just buy the components for their trade, but we have to kill mobs that drop poison sacs, and all these mobs are level 6 tops (giant spiders, darkweed snakes). Inlike words, runes, or jewels, poison components are not dropped by anything that could give a poison making rogue (20+) experience. We must go out of our way to revisit newbie grounds and either auction for or kill snake after snake for poison glands, ichors, or what have you. <P>hopefully the expansion can do the following with poison:<P>1) Have components drop more often, so I do not have to spend an hour killing lvl 6 snakes before I can make a vial.<P>2) have rogue guilds sell practice solution, and Idea that jas been discussed amongst rogues of my server, a good way for a rogue to practice apply up to a certain skill level, since APPLY skill affects the duration and strongness of your poison. <P>3) make poison vials stackable. Each poison vial needs its oown slot, hoepfully stacking them will reduce space.<P>4) When apply poison is mastered, allow rogues to poison others' weapons. <P>5) Poison throwing weapons, to hit em with poison before battle. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I didnt really note what he said, if he was a merchant, I cant even remember his name, I would check it out after the server resets cause I think He gets killed because players dont know what hes for.

</FONT><HR>Ruklaol - I've never heard of rogues being the king of damage dealing either.  I've always pictured rogues as the solitary thief.  I've never seen rogues joining with knights and wizards.  They have always had to group with other rogues in fantasy stories.  In my opinion, making rogues more group friendly, makes them less-rogueless.  <P>What I would like to see is exp from pickpocketing  with decent loot, pickpocket at lvl 1, and not losing hide when you successfully pickpocket.  I'd like to see a sniper capability with bow that would cause severe damage or possibly even death with one hit on certain targets.  I'd also like to see pickpocket on teams server.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Things rogues ARE the king of:<P>1.) Melee damage<BR>2.) Corpse Recovery<P>1.)  I have seen a level 40 rogue and level 38 rogue drop a level 35ish mob in 10 seconds.  Both had alacrity and got in 2 backstabs each.  One backstabbed for about 325 and 300 the other for 250 and 240.  I also saw them drop the next mob they faced in 20 seconds.  Then another in 20 seconds and another in 20 seconds. This was all in one fight.  As a cleric all I had to do was group heal twice (200HP total to everyone) since the enchanter got hit once or twice after doing mezzes, and the rogues were trading getting hit for the few seconds it took them to kill the mob.  <P>I have also fought with 2 monks who had alacrity.  A level 47 and a level 42 against the exact same mobs in the exact same place (as we were passing through).  It took them about 30 second to kill each mob.  I had to use a little  more mana on heals too (though still not much overall).  If these monks had been level 40 and 38 I bet it would have taken about a minute per kill and I of course would have needed to heal alot more damage.<P>No melee class can do a lot of damage NOW like a rogue.  I have been in many groups where we didn't bother rooting/snareing runners because the rogue would BS the runners once and they would die.  <P>2.)  Only rogues can be invisible to both live and undead mobs at the same time.  'Nuff said.<P><BR>Rogues don't start doig serious damage until level 30+.  And BS doesn't really start rocking until you get a weapon that does 10 or higher base damage and you have a STR of 150+.   Get those three things (level, str, and base dmg) as high as possible and people who party with you once will be looking for you every time they are online from then on.<P>There are a lot of poorly equipped rogues out there.  Once you work with a well equipped one you will see a world of difference.  <P>Mathilda<P>Cleric of Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>It's all about your skillz. I am always the puller for my group in lower guk. Doesn't matter if there is a monk or not. I know Lower Guk like the back of my hand. I can pull from the Noble to the live zone or the live tower to the zone. EE to zone, done. It all depends on the situation. I can't pull squat from Sol A, I just don't know that dungeon. Give me a couple days and I will pull it like a champ. I really get mad when somebody stereotypes me due to my class. One of the biggest kicks I got out of the game in a long time was a few days ago. Went to Live tower for some CR. Rogues are the king of CR. There was a group of mid to low 40s waiting to pull the top of the tower and work their way down. The corpse I was after was inside the tower in the hall. Pretty much at the cruasader's feet. I was hiding and sneaking and some one had see invis. They say "Hey so and so is here" I say hi and then they pull the top of the tower. 3 frogs no big deal. Their Necro starts to get beat on and none of the tanks notice, so I walk up and Backstab it. Get it's attention and fight it for a few rounds then the tanks come over and I evade and walk away. Now I go to take a look inside the tower and it is full pop. I tell a member or the tower group this and ask him if they are ready for 3 frogs. Well I managed to pull just one. The necro said "How the hell did you pull just 1?" I just responded with "Hehe  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">" Then I proceded to pull the rest of the tower and then CR the corpse back to the zone and I felt all was well with the world. Here I am in a spot with all yellow/red mobs and I am pulling for a party that is all red to me. I felt the power of the rogue. I can also outdamage just about any melee class that is not plane equiped level 50 and below. I know what I can and can't do and I use it to my advantage. Class means little if you can't use your skillz. That is my point. Any class can be a great class if the player knows how to play the game. I do think Rogues are the Kings of melee damage also though.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Static_Buzz<P>What was in that again?

</FONT><HR> I play a rogue and it sucks. They are the weakest  most group dependent class in the game with the least to offer for getting into a group. Rogues dont tank much better than a caster class that has a pet and they will never out damage a caster with that has a pet. Unless your group is melee based with a cleric having a rogue is a detriment to your party.  This is a game that thrives off killing to acheive power.  Furthermore, if you are a de rogue and have terrible strenght base you will never see the 300 bs damage. The barb rogues are the best. The class is far more work than fun.  And if you like to solo or do anything alone dont play a rogue. You are lucky to find low blues you can solo.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Rogues are definitely the masters of melee damage. At 37th, a 45th monk tried to take a kill from me. So, I evaded all the damage onto him and backstabbed away. I didn't get hurt, the monk was near dead when the mob dropped, and I got the kill, easily. And that's versus a monk eight levels higher than me. A 50th monk would prolly have beaten me, but hey, I'm 40th now, not sure a 50th monk could beat me NOW.<P>No melee class can take a kill from me, I don't think, except another rogue of course. Certainly not if they are close to my level. Maybe a 50th warrior with planes gear can still take a kill from me, but I bet it'd be surprisingly close and he'd definitely take the bulk of the damage doing it, while I'd be ready to go try another mob immediately.<P>As to un-soloable, that is a myth. I am 40th now (ugh) and have solo'd my way there mainly. I HAVE grouped some, but not a heck of a lot. And that's with 25 days /played time. The next ten levels (well, 20, if you count expansion), I will probably be grouping mainly, since I have shown people how incredibly effective a rogue can be and now a lot of people want me around.<P>Oh yeah, another funny one. Was walking by Paw at like 30th or so and a gnoll attacked me. Well, it was blue, so I started whacking on it. Some wizard yellow to me decides he wants the gnoll so he blasts it. I evade and it jumps on him and starts pounding him. While he scrambles to get off a root, I backstab away. He finally gets off the root, but 2 secs later, gnoll dead, my kill, pretty beat up wizard. It isn't JUST the melee classes I can beat, I can sometimes beat the casters too.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Kothos Keenblade, 40th Rogue, Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I've played a rogue for a year now, so I feel like I can throw in my 2 coppers here. Are rogues the kings of damage? No, at least not inherently. Like with all melee classes, it depends on the equipment. With a bloodclaw, for example, I could backstab for the upper 60s. However, with a pair of SBDs, I'm doing 100. Piercing goes from 12 to 20. So, with a pair of SBDs, I do much, much more damage. My wife plays a ranger - uses a short sword of morin and a thulian claw. We're about dead even in damage. The MOB is constantly turning from one to the other of us. So, are we damage kings? No more than well equiped rangers, pallies, or any other melee class. That said, however, I'd like to point out that there are things we can do that I have not seen other classes manage. An example would be in mistmoore near the castle entrance - that's a pretty good drop there. Easiest thing in the world for me to come up on a MOB, utterly unseen, BS it for about 80 or 90 (or more if I'm lucky), and then jump off the cliff (taking under 10 dmg, usually) and run like crazy. Meanwhile, the MOB is running down the ramp, taking the long way. Even without SOW, I'm back at my group ready to go long before the Ancil (or whatever) arrives. You see, it's all in how you play the class. Every class is like this, it has good and bad. The key is to learn what your class can do that nobody else can and work that...every day. Myself, I've got a bard, a mage, a monk, and a necro as well, but I keep comming back to the rogue.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum13&number=13&thisthread=001579&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum13&number=13&thisthread=001579&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
