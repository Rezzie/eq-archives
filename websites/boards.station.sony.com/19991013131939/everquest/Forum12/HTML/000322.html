</FONT><HR>Though I do not completely agree with all the original poster said, I must interject on the  comments made in replies.<P>I play a 26th lvl Teir'dal Mage.<P>Someone said "You get a pet, nuff said?"<P>Nope, not enough... While I will admit taht Elementals are fun to fight along side, They have *many* faults.  Number 1 is Mages have NO root of ANY kind.  Aka, Creature runs and if i can't kill it right away then it'll bring back nasties.<P>"Let your Ele kill it" Well think about that.  Ele goes chasing after the creature, kills it... but now is WAY deep in the dungeon, on way back it gets seen and attacked... then all the creatures after it come after me.<BR>ALSO, many real green creatures will attack the Ele even if it's just standing htere... While if a PC is standing next to greens, most of hte time nothing will happen.<P>Another poster listed a number of summoned items Mages can create.  Yup, they're correct about them.  But lets see their usefullness to a group.  <BR>-"Food/water", every once in a while this can be helpful, but generally at my level people already purchase plenty to last w/o need of hte summons. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Sorry about the extra post... hit the wrong button.<P>Continuing on....<P>- "summoned Bandages"  THis is one of the few  handy summons.. but in general most people already have a bunch of bandages if they need them.  So it also (as with food/water) becomes a "personal" assist.  Not good for group<P>-  "Ring of Flying" I love this one... Every other pure magic user can fly right around lvl 30.  Mages get this one at 39.  How nice... Considering it really doesn't help you a *whole* lot, it's more of a "show" spell and not helpful to a group.<P>If you actually look at the *entire* list of summoned items for mages, and *think* about them.  You will realize that there are no helpful summons for a group.  "Coldstone" is the closest, but Everyone by that time has somehting or is used to fighting in the dark that they don't need it.<P>Any other questions?<P><BR>Tyras V'stal<BR>Mage, Povar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Don't get me wrong, I agree Magicians got the shaft.<P>But, just for clarification, most of us wizards aren't wanting God-level damage spells (well, those of us who've graduated high school, at least).<P>Personally, right now, I think a big step would be removing the 6 level cap on damage (hey, even if I can only hit it for a little damage, at least I'm contributing *something*).  And, assuming monster resistances got beefed up during the last patch, tone them back down to where they were a week ago.<P>(To back that up:  I wound up having to solo for a couple of days around the patch.  After the patch, the stuff I'd been handling fairly easily was suddenly resisting everything I threw at it.  These were blues and greens.  I don't think it's too unreasonable to expect to be able to cast a spell that actually hits, say, a yellow).<P>Every other class has a way around that 6 level limit and the monstrous resist rates.  Wizards don't.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>guys i wasnt complaining about magicians DD i think its fine all i was saying is that wiz's is a LOT better and all the wis'z moaning about how good magi DD is should actually play a magi.<BR>DD isnt a big part of magi combat work, nowadays its rare for me to cast more than 1 dd spell at any monster (unless soloing or its an enemy caster) pet buffing and management flame shields and debuffs are my stock in trade these days (not a complaint thats what magi do).<P>i do think magi enc and wiz all need tweaking to bring them up to line with  clerics power.<P>the Enc clarity needs to be upped a bit to compete with that bard song (cant remeber name but it increases mana regen at 100% of med).<BR>wiz's teleprts need increasing in variety at lower levels.<BR>magi summoned items need to be beefed so that a group we join might actually want what we summon.<P>the issue of wiz's and resists is a tuff one, i do agree they have a real prob here, but im not sure it should be fixed or whether its a good and sensible balance to the class, <BR>what i mean is because of wiz's struggling to get full damage and having bad resistsit really makes it worth myself or others debuffing it first, this is good coz it makes us work as a group but bad because it nails wiz's on the solo front,tho with the exception of the odd green thats killed me while i travel i havent solod in 18 levels.<P>iumanu<P>p.s once again i state that i believe the wiz's and magi are equal in combat terms just different, </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>In another post I came up with a bunch of "flavor" summonings that I thought would make the Magician a lot of fun to play and more valuable to a group.  I am completely in favor of this, I think it adds a great deal to the game.<P>That said, I have played a Magician and a Wizard to the 12 lvl (Wiz is finally 13 - Yeah!) and there was NO time when the Wizard could consider taking on a yellow creature.  exp. gain aside (which, it could be argued, is offset by the pet), this has a much larger impact then you might imagine.  Because the Wizard is not able to take on yellows, he's not making the money that the Magician character is making.  With less money he has no resources to buy armor... armor that the Wizard would have gotten much more use out of.<P>"You don't know a character till you play him to the 20 lvl" - I agree with this, however...  The impact of a lower-level character not being usefull to a group is a  bigger handicap than just having to solo.  <P>As a 1-11 Wizard I had a very hard time finding groups to take me - no food/water/bandages, no buffs, no tanking ability, and my DD was/is matched by almost every other spell caster (and Enchanters have such good buff/debuffs who wouldn't want them).  So?  Well, look at it this way, while you were (or should have been) forming good relationships with other characters, relationships that are essential for continuing your characters developmnet, I was the wall flower.<P>This is why I was doing all that bleeting (plus, some prankster changed me into a sheep for awhile).  That, and the fact that I want my gun to be bigger then yours  =P<P>We all need more non-combat ("flavor") spells for this to start to feel more like a real world.  To think that the only spell research that would ever get done is offense/defense is foolish.  Military applications may come fist, but the private sector is always going to turn firepower into fireworks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000322&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000322&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
