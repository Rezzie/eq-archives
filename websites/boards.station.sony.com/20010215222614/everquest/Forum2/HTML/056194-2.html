</FONT><HR>I seriously doubt 90% of groups would choose a druid/shaman over the cleric as the group's healer.  But, it will allow groups to be formed if no cleric is around.  Hey maybe they will get ressurect to help when clerics aren't around.  Maybe by 2004 warriors will be able to SOW.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It's simple really.  As things now stand, post-50 clerics can pretty much be assurred of getting a group shortly after logging in.  Why would they want to give that up?  (I sure wouldn't. /shrug)  Make shaman and druids into effective healers where 2 of them can keep a group alive so a cleric, while preferrable is not *required*, then clerics may have to wait a bit for that group.  The fact that just about all other classes (not enchanters) are in that boat now doesn't count.  Actually it's probably worse right now for some classes than it ever will be for a cleric.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Drakewyn:  It sucks that the low-30's are problematic for you.  I have two good friends in my rather small guild, and they've never mentioned a problem, and I've discussed it with them in recent days.  Whenever a group had a slot, they'd get in it.  If a druid or shaman was present, they'd switch over to another role, since cleric heals are more efficient, and most of them specialize in something other than alteration (I'm a rare exception).<P>In any event, since all the recent complaints are dealing with the post-50 game and the new healing spells for druids and shaman, your concerns don't appear to be part of this thread.  Perhaps you should join Cleric Talk Part 5?  Your issues would seem to be appropriate for that thread, and you'll stand a better chance of them being heard by the folks that matter at Verant.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I dont play a cleric, but I have played another primarily buff based group (chanter). And though there concerns are a little different, the whole idea of sit, mezz, buff, sit.. just gets a little (EXTREMELY) boring. Now Im NOT here to ask for anything for Chanters, that would just be rude. But PLEASE consider helping out the clerics. They deserve to play the game too! <P>Perhaps giving them something like upgraded stun spells with reasonable mana use. Then they could help prevent damage, save chanters when dumb tanks break mezz, and have a little fun.

</FONT><HR>I still would like to know where this "cakewalk" to Level 50 for my Druid is. I sure as Hell haven't found it with all the grouping (since 99% of my time in game is spent grouped), the dungeon crawls (Dalnir, Permafrost, Sol A, Najena, etc.) I've done, and the three-bubbles-into-34-oh-crap-I-died-again-now-I-lost-a-bubble-again dance I've been doing all week in Rathe Mountains.<P>When someone finds the cakewalk route to 50 for this grouping Druid that doesn't involve me trying to quad kite (since I'd rather group), or being powerlevelled by a higher level Druid or Necro, please let me know.<P>Until then, /rude to anyone who thinks that it's all tra la la, easy as pie to get this class to 50.

</FONT><HR>Hehe, I just re-read one of these posts and had to laugh.  It stated that shaman and druids heal just fine right now except for the uber mob encounters.  Ok, I challenge any post-50 cleric to get a group (possibly friends would help you "proove" your point-Heh) together and explain to them that the cleric will only be using their GH spell (which for a cleric is more mana efficient anyway) to keep that group alive (after all it's only fair to warn the group--just have a necro and plenty of coffins available for some of these places).  Ok, then go to Karnor and do the tower--might work ok.  Next go to Hands--&lt;grin&gt;.  Next try Chardock, not the zone though that's too easy.  Now Sebilis disco or crypt.  Then, if you still are not convinced, you can move to SoV.  &lt;grin&gt;  Repeat, using only SH.  Not really a fair comparison because you get it at such a low level that it really doesn't fizzle much at all post 50.  /shrug.<P>IF you can get a group to do that with you, you will find what druids and shaman and the rest of the classes already know.  Druids and shaman don't heal "fine" right now. At least not post-50.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I have more respect for rangers than Druids. People who chose to play a ranger decided to NOT take the path of least resistance and play a druid.<BR> <BR>I've had so many problems with druids. Not ALL druids are like this but I've had druids -<BR> <BR>Ninja loot some very nice items and go "link dead" and not log back on until days later.<BR> <BR>I've had druids who were supposed to heal not heal and let people die because they were watching south park and then they said, "Sorry you died bud! I suxor! Southpark wuz on"<BR> <BR>I've seen druids kite Sand Giants along the beach killing a dozen newbies.<P>A druid KSed the AC from my friend so he could sell multi-quest "rights" to Jboots on Ebay.<P>A druid once KSed the HERO from me when I was trying to get a bracer with my warrior. I asked him why he did that when he saw me killing it and he said, "SUX 2 B U!"<BR> <BR>No, not ALL druids are immature 13 year old kids who farm items for EBay and KS and kite stuff over newbies - but a hell of a lot of them are. SO yes, I will *always* pick a ranger over a druid. In fact, I never group with druids anymore unless I know them in RL.

</FONT><HR>I can't believe how ignorant you clerics are. The changes that were made only affect the post 50 game. And you are worried about not getting a group now? Whatever. A cleric will ALWAYS be chosen over a druid in a post 50 group. ALWAYS. <P>Quit complaining that another class gets an improvement. If you want to have all the abilities of another class, then start over and make a character of that class. <BR>If you don't want to do that  because you LIKE your current class, then quit complaining. <BR>This is nothing more than a "GAME" so quit taking it so seriously. Just play and have fun, or better yet, quit and leave the other classes alone.<P>As clerics, you have BY FAR the best armor of any non melee class, you have a way of making money the same as druids do with ports. If you want to make money for services, just start selling ressurections. If someone is willing to pay 100pp for a port, to save a half hour of travel. How much do you think they are willing to pay to regain between an hour and 6 hours of lost exp. <P>I'm not saying you couldnt use improvements, but STOP trying to get other classes nerfed, or stop them from getting improvements.<P>The most important thing you guys should be whining about right now is getting standard invis spells. Maybe they could even throw you a Dot or 2. That would help you solo, which you are saying you want.

I've grouped with Shamans that have gotten me killed because they'd rather cast a DD on an HG chasing me when I have less than a bubble of health instead of healing me and keeping me alive.<P>I've grouped with Bards that have gotten the entire group killed because they would pull before the healers were ready, or even before the Chanter was ready. <P>Do I hate ALL Bards or Shamans, and reject them ALL or call for ALL of them to be nerfed into extinction because of some idiots I've encountered who just happen to play that class? NO, I don't. Here's a shocker-- I just don't group with those people again.

</FONT><HR>Oh, please Cab, don't be ridiculous.  Each of those crimes has also been committed by every class in the game.  A wizard was kiting spectres at the Oasis Dock last week, that got a dozen of us killed (playing my 16 SK).  I had a Rogue ninja a Forest Loop 2 weeks ago at Karnor's wall.  I've been trained by one Warrior 5 times (separate occasions), and another Ranger 3 times (separate occasions).  The Ranger ks'd twice, too.  <P>A DE Cleric stole the Orc Camp in Misty from my L14 Rogue, so she could get better faction and belts (it was 3 AM PST, and no guides online).  Nothing stopped her from constantly taking the kills and belts, even though she wasn't getting any exp at 30.<P>I've had every class except cleric refuse to pay for a port after touchdown and after agreeing to do so.  I only hired myself out during those levels where I earned the spells.  I've had folks convince me they were in a rush, and I've stopped what I was doing to port, and they then disband and bail as soon as we arrive.  I refuse to demand payment first.<P>If your sole reason for despising an entire class is because of the actions of a few individuals, then you need serious counselling.  It's not that different from racism or classism or other elitist views.  "Those people are all so . . . ."

</FONT><HR>T-Wax said:<BR>"I can't believe how ignorant you clerics are. The changes that were made only affect the post 50 game. And you are worried about not getting a group now? Whatever. A cleric will ALWAYS be chosen over a druid in a post 50 group. ALWAYS."<P>Two points:<BR>1. You assume all characters are the same level? Why would anyone want a cleric level 48 (mainly casting Sup Heal) over a druid 51 (mainly casting Sup Heal)? Sure, clerics buff. Druids buff too. Clerics can rez. Well, I'd rather not be killed than go around relying on the rez in the group.<P>So, at some levels, these changes just might make druids or shaman MORE viable in a group than clerics just a few levels lower.<P>2. Sure, at the highest levels a cleric will be chosen over a shaman or a druid. But that assumes that all three are at the zone LFG. That is not often the case. Hardly ever.<P>Much more realistically, a group that needs a healer finds one at the zone and invites him. If druids/shamans heal well enough to get into groups, and there is one at the zone but no cleric at the zone, then the group will invite the druid/shaman.<P>A few minutes later when a cleric zones in, he will be LFG because that group already got what they needed. Not because that group preferred druid/shaman healing to clerics, but because they took what was available.<P>Morodullin<BR>Rebutting Priest o Brell</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The best analogy i think of to the post 50 game, and the recent changes and why some are upset. Is actually a group of kids lining a fence to play ball in a local park, there are two captains, choosing teams, they look over the lot, and one by one they hand pick the best players one at a time., until all the rest are left standing on the fence to watch the game or go home.<P>Before the change, all the Clerics , warriors, and enchanters and sometimes bards made the group. Some others might have been picked just because they had been friends with the captain, and honestly even then they wondered if the choices will mess up thier chances of winning the game.<P>The Kids who get picked are not surprised, they are picked every single day, and are used to the sorting. Sadly the kids who don't get picked are also used to it, and pair off and go play catch with long faces. <P>Then one day a coach shows up, (verant) and tells the captains that they need to invite the other kids as well. The Captains complain that the other kids are useless for what they want to do, and have to choose as they do. The Coach says "I see, hmmm" and then for the next week works with those kids improving thier skills, so that each could be a valued member on the team. The captains happy that there is more choice and starts to pick more broadly, and some days some kids play, and on differnt days, others are chosen. But for the most part, everyone gets to play and have fun.<P>The coach smiles... "there i think that will work"<P>Suddenly he is kicked in the shins, and looks down at an angry child.<P>the angry kid complains "I worked Very hard through the last 50 games, i practiced and practiced, yet you come along and in a week, you get almost everyone as good as me, now i am usless and will never find a group to play with."<P>"Oh I see," says the coach, looking over at the  the other children playing happily in the field. "none of these other children have played 50 games"<P>"not as hard as i did," said the child "I deserve to be picked everyday because i worked so hard and it was so tough for me."<P>"really" said the coach, "and why should you be the only one to play in this nice new field, this field that didn't even exist before you finished your 45th game of the season. So how could you deserve it."<P>"Becasue im the catcher" says the child in astonishment, the game can't happen without a catcher. Thats what i do, I catch."<P>"true said the coach, smiling, "and you are the best at it, but what if your sick, or need to go home."<P>"then we will play tomorrow" said the boy, with his hands angerly on his hips. "when i have time to come back and play."<P>The coach thinks about this for a minute and says..<P>"do you think it is fair to the other children that they must wait for you to play, and if you don't come they have to go home?"<P>"Im the catcher, its all i do" said the angry child in responce. "been that way for 50 games, its only fair. I don't get to pitch, or field or get a chance to be a short stop."<P>The coach realizing he was not going to get anywhere, tries a differnt Tactic.<P>Well i was working with Johny and Susan, you know them, they are usually playing outfield, but sometimes sit in for third base.<P>"Yea" said the child, making a disgusted face laughing "they stink."<P>"well" said the coach carefully "they did, but now they are almost half as good as you are, not quite, but close to half, and I would like to use them in a pinch, I think two of them might be able to do it together."<P>The childs face alit with anger, done with this conversation, and stomps over to where the other kids where playing ball happily. He walks over to the catcher, and pushes her down hard and takes the ball. "Its my ball, and im going home" with that, he stomps out of the park.<P>Another young player comes to Susans aid, and picks her off the ground. "Don't worry about him," the other says "He was always like that since day one, doesn't surprise me that he doesn't play nice."<P>Susan looks over at the coach unsure, who smile backs and throws back a new ball, One that all can share not just a few.<P>The Coach looks over the group as they play, and is satified everyone is having fun. He notices that allot of the catchers are having a grand time playing with thier new team mates, and don't seem upset at all. <P><BR>Somewhere in the distance, there is a faint noise as  another trashbarrel crashes over down on some deserted street, as the insulted catcher takes his wrath out on anything that lays in his path on his way home.<P><BR>and Thats my analogy, as i see it<P>And yes, i play a cleric, druid and warrior,and i do not have anyproblem with any of the changes<P><BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>In simple terms, when your role in the game is to be FAR better at something than all other classes, it's an attack to reduce this lead without granting additional abilities.<P>Clerics did very well, tolorating the barage of "Can you rez me" requests they get all day long.  The trade-off of this is they get into groups VERY easily because their healing is vastly supperior to other classes.<P>Now, the one benefit, being able to heal others FAR better than other classes is being reduced to only somewhat better.  The cleric will no longer be the REQUIRED class to have.  This means clerics will have a harder time finding a group.<P>Now, on a twisted note, look at wizards, who were supposed to be the masters at dishing out magical damage.  Other classes all get upgrades, but with all the upgrades to the other classes, wizards havn't even gotten a response indicating Absor or anyone else even cares about balancing the wizard class.  When a class is far down the list of desired party members, every upgrade given to the more desired classes becomes an attack, and an insult.  If you've ever wondered why wizards sometimes seem bitter, try going for two years without a significant upgrade to ability, and an insulting selection of post 50 spells.  At least clerics got an upgraded rez, wizards got increased AoE which no one lets wizards use.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR> This was posted in an earlier thread..<P> """On any given day, the number of druids + shaman is roughly 3 to 4 times the number of clerics on most servers."""<P> This is two classes vs one you're comparing. A better estimate, since druids seem to be recieving the most flaming from this is to compare the number of druids vs clerics. The druids will outnumber the clerics, but the warriors also outnumber the clerics, and also, on an even number of occasions outnumber druids too. If you consider that just being one of the main classes always needing heals in battle, not including rangers,rogues,and Sk's, this type of a comparison quickly falls on its face.<P> You ask a high level tank what they need most of the time, several things will come up.<BR>a) Need CH's<BR>b) Need buffs<BR>c) Need ports <BR>d) Need sow<BR>e) Need ress when it all goes wrong<P> Sup heal is not a CH, celestrial elixer is not a CH. SLN is not an Aego, or a Heroism, or a symbol or any sorts. 3-4k hps is ALOT of sup heals to get back up to full and keep it there, not even including mana. No one will ever come close to clerics demands for ress. Strangly, the demand is about as much for ports, since a major amount of the time, the two are tied together.<BR> <BR> A cleric with a self only travel spell, be it sow or a little gate spell wouldn't be too bad, after all, this would lower the demand on druids and shamans in this area, and since demand IS what all the clerics seem to be complaining about, a small price to pay.<P><BR>Jhade<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Just one. Keep a group alive."--<P>WRONG! This is getting tiring to hear. Clerics can do many many things, EVEN post50 (and thats unusual for any class post50 - post50 is the one trick pony race).<P>--"Ok, we can solo a little. Very light blues with tons of downtime."--<P>Jeez, try playing a warrior some time. Soloing the cleric is a breeze.<P>--"Give enough healing ability to druids and shamans, and you have more than tripled the number of group healers, without tripling the number of groups."--<P>Errr .... this is your wake up call. If you triple the number of healers, you triple the number of groups. Have you not played post50? Without a healer you cant play. There are not enough cleric to fill this role as it is (and there should NOT be). <P>--"Since that is all we do, keep groups alive or solo so miserably that it isn't worth the time, failing to join a group means failing to play."--<P>Warriors tank. Thats all they do. are you saying if hybrids can tank the warrior wont get groups and therefore wont be able to play?<P>--"I just don't look forward to tripling the time I spend LFG while I can't play. "--<P>You wont, and even if you did it would be less time than the other 13/14 classes who have to currently wait for the clerics to log on or powerlevel themselves up.<P><BR>Smendle:<P>--"Improving the healing powers of druids and shaman post 50 degraded the value of a cleric in a group, like it or not thats the result."--<P>We are no longer Gods yeah, but we are still the number one desired class in the game. Do we deserve more? No way. We are one class out of 14. We can solo, we can group, we are one of the most fun classes in the game, we are loved, we are sought after ... if you aint happy with that, dont play a cleric.<P>--"The only thing you will "need" a cleric for, after these changes go live, is to regain 96% of your exp if you happend to have died."--<P>No, thats the only reason they will need the bad clerics. The rest of us will be just fine thanks.<P>--"That IS the plain TRUTH. Whether you like it or not, whether you think clerics are *****ing about it or not. It is the 100% pure TRUTH."--<P>It is the truth. Bad clerics will now be less able to get groups. The cleric can no longer hold absolute power over a group based upon his class, rather than his ability. And amen to that change. Some of us chose the class cos we liked it, not cos just being a cleric gave absolute power.<P>--"I am sorry if a druid/shaman dont like to play like a cleric in SoV when no cleric is around, but hey they are getting a taste of what its like to be a cleric. "--<P>Its like being a newscaster giving the same news lines every hour on the hour. Ok here goes: ITS NOT DRUIDS/SHAMANS WHO SUFFER CLERIC DEPENDANCY!<P>Got it? Its all the other classes who need us.

At 34 I could get groups with lvl 50s with ease (if i didnt mind the bad exp i gained in those days).<P>--"Again, I don't care about the post-50 game...

</FONT><HR>Robertl, here's my opinion as a post-50 cleric:<P>Shamans and Druids have underpowered healing abilities in the post-50 arena and need an upgrade.<P>That said, I think more trouble lies with the post-55 game. If a shaman could stick a slow on some of the velious mobs, they would be much more viable.<P>Druids, on the other hand, have had it VERY easy from levels 1-50. Their lack of power in the 50-60 arena is, in my opinion, fair and balanced, pending a minor healing upgrade. Those velious mobs hit too damn hard, it's rough enough on the cleric.<P>- Gaeb<P>PS: As a cleric who's seen nothing but nerfs coming his way lately, I would like some form of upgrade as well. Clerics are boring, the second account is not a joke. Give us more versitality or more interesting spell lines.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Gizzi, Dadi, Phelan...<P>Let me make one thing ONCE AGAIN perfectly clear.<P>I am all for the healing improvements for Druids and Shamen.  I would like to have seen Shamen also get another level 60 spell, like the Druids did... but that's a totally different thread.<P>YES at level 34 Clerics still get passed up for groups.  Yes I can heal twice as many points in a cast, but the groups that I DO group with rarely need that powerful a heal... unless I deliberately let them wait before I heal, which gets most tanks VERY nervous.<BR>The same group with a Druid kills mobs faster because of damage shields and DoTs from the Druid... plus can get away faster because of SoW.  Not to mention that Strength buff that everyone asks for, even if it doesn't appear to actually do anything for my Paladin when she gets it.<BR>The same group with a Shaman kills mobs faster because of Haste, takes less damage because of Slow... plus the bonuses listed above for SoW and stat buffs.<P>My Cleric gets what few groups she gets because of people who know and like me.  Who know that I don't just use Stuns on caster mobs, because Stuns are pretty great against those fast-hitting mobs with daggers/whips too.<P>But you know... those Stuns don't help nearly as much as all the Shaman & Druid bennies.<P>If I am soloing with my Warrior (in her late 20's) and someone were to say "Hey, I can back you up with a Cleric, Shaman or a Druid.  They're all the same level and I have no preference."  I'd ask him to bring his Shaman or his Druid...  After all, I've seen both sides and the Shaman/Druid working with a Warrior is a much more powerful combo than a Cleric working with a Warrior at the mid levels.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Jhade Bard said<P>"This was posted in an earlier thread..<BR>"""On any given day, the number of druids + shaman is roughly 3 to 4 times the number of clerics on most servers."""<P>This is two classes vs one you're comparing. A better estimate, since druids seem to be recieving the most flaming from this is to compare the number of druids vs clerics. The druids will outnumber the clerics, but the warriors also outnumber the clerics, and also, on an even number of occasions outnumber druids too. If you consider that just being one of the main classes always needing heals in battle, not including rangers,rogues,and Sk's, this type of a comparison quickly falls on its face."<P>I wasn't trying to win a fallacied argument by comparing one class to two other classes. It wasn't intended to validate any class by comparing numbers played to any other one or two classes.<P>My point was simply to point out the numbers of healers. If shamans and druids together outnumber clerics by 3:1, then increasing their healing abilities means the number of total healers is multiplied by 4. Simple math. <P>Unless the number of groups is also multiplied by 4, then this increase creates an oversurplus of healers.<P>That was my only point. A simple one. And it doesn't fall on its face.<P>Gizzi_Xegony<P>You said I was wrong that clerics only do one thing: Keep people alive. <P>Ok, what else do we do? Please tell me what else I should be doing in a group other than keeping people alive? I buff them so they live longer (not so they do more damage, or win fights faster, but so they live longer). I heal them when they are hurt to keep them alive. I rez them when they are dead to keep them alive. Occasionally I stun a mob pounding on a chanter to keep the chanter alive.<P>But when the dust settles, every spell I cast and every action I take is all about keeping people alive.<P>What do you think I am doing wrong?<P>You also said that if we triple the number of healers, we triple the number of groups. <P>I disagree.<P>That would literally mean that for every group adventuring in a zone, there were 12 people at the zoneline waiting. I've been in Lguk with every spot camped (6 groups) but there were not 72 players at the zoneline LFG. In KC, 60 players in the dungeon, but only 8 were at zonline meaning 52 were grouped and adventuring. My last trip to Plane of Growth had ZERO people at the zoneline. Your math would have told me their should have been 80 people in there at the zone-in LFG, or at least 80 extra people wandering Norrath LFG. There weren't, I assure you. Better rethink your rebuttal here.<P>And I don't think any of my arguements were strictly about post-50 play. So telling me they should be is your own non-sequitor.<P>And yes, I will triple my LFG time after there are 3x the number of healers. Either you say their healing enhancements aren't good enough to replace a cleric, in which case they need to get Verant to fix this failure (the point was, after all, to enhance their healing to replace clerics when needed; if they can't, then Verant missed the point) or you say they can replace clerics, in which case, at least sometimes, they will. Simple logic. Irrefutable.<P>Dispute my assumption of 3x healers, for it is just an assumption, but the rest of the logic is sound.<P>Please remember everyone, I advocated increased healing for druids and shamans, and I'm glad they got it. I think every post I have made on this subject is clear on that point.<P>My initial post attempted to aske the thread-starter's question about why clerics are complaining.<P>My subsequent posts attempted to dispel some illusions many of you seem to have, and to address some of your rebuttals to my first post.<P>In summary:<P>Druids and shamans needed better healing so they can get groups and help everyone play more when clerics aren't around. To succeed at this goal, their healing enhancements must be sufficient to keep groups alive in the higher levels. <P>The changes on test may not be sufficient. These changes do give the best non-CH cleric healing spells to the other prist classes, and will greatly enhance their healing. But it may not be enough as these healing enhancements may not allow a druid or shaman to fully replace a cleric with CH.<P>If these changes are insufficient, then more changes are still needed.<P>Once sufficient changes have been made to druids and shamans that they can step into the group healer role in the high-end game, then they will. Perhaps clerics will still be preferred (depending on how much enhancing druids and shamans get), but at times when clerics are not immediately available, druids and shamans will fill the role (after all, that is why they got these sufficient changes to their healing). <P>That logic should be easy to follow, and it is true.<P>And this does mean that the numbers of healers will increase greatly. Perhaps 3x or even 4x as many healers (after sufficient enhancements to druids and shamans) as there  are now.<P>I don't believe for a moment that there will be 3x or 4x as many groups. There just arent' THAT many people lfg now.<P>And any economics student can tell you what happens to demand (for healers) when the supply outweighs the demand. Answer: all healers, clerics, druids, and shaman alike, will be devalued.<P>Still following the logic?<P>If all healers are devalued, they will seek other avenues of enjoyment.<P>Druids will be able to solo. Shamans can solo too. Clerics cannot solo well at all.<P>So when the supply so greatly exceeds the demand, druids and shamans will still be able to play, but clerics will not.<P>This is the basis of our complaint.<P>The solution?<P>Give shamans and druids sufficient healing power to fill in when we are not there. <P>BUT...<P>...Realize this devalues us through massive oversuply exceeding demand and provide us with some alternative to forced grouping.<P>Verant has taken the first step without offering any indication of fulfilling the second step. Without even acknowledging the existence of the second step.<P>That, in a nutshell, logically, is why clerics are complaining.<P>Morodullin<BR>Logical Priest o Brell<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
