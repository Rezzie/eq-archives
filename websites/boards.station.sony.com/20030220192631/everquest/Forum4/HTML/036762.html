Guilded together? Holding hands frolicing thru Innothule swamp pretending nothing ever happened. Why does VI write all this lore when nobody even pays attention to it. It's like the lore is for the NPC's only or something. I myself love to roleplay. It's disheartening to see Iksars hanging out in Kelethin or Rivervale. Or Paladins and SK's hanging out. I know, try the FV server.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"> I did. I din't like it for the same reasons that the other poster posted about.

I once left a guild that was supposed to be only for evil races when wood elves and high elves began joining.  But just because your race has tensions with another race, that doesn't mean you can't roleplay out a viable reason why two opposing races might have a need to fight together.  Maybe the darker race is only using the lighter to accomplish some sinister, unreveiled plot.  While the light race is trying to show the other the true path?  <P>With a little imagination, you can reason out any number of scenerios and put to bed any concerns about SOE's innability to make a roleplaying game that actualy works for roleplayers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

There was a time when guilds that followed strict guidelines were fairly common, at least withing their guild.  Most people tend to set their differences aside when it comes to xping.  It's tough to get a group together (unless it's within such a guild) that can follow RP guidelines and be effective in the "high end" game.  Not to say that it can'tbe done, but most people who log in for a couple of hours and decide they want to earn some xp have to kinda take what they can get.<P>I've seen people good at roleplaying some animosity while still grouping and helping people they "hate."  I've also seen the extreme, like clerics that wouldn't heal or buff people on the opposite extreme.  <P>The sad thing is, there are some quests that kinda ruin the whole RP atmosphere.  For example, having to kill someone in OT for the mage epic.  It's ok if you're a good race, but evil mages gotta kill him too.  I think evil wizards face a similar issue with one of their epic pieces (from Venril Sathitr), but I'm not real familiar with that.  I just know trying to get a group of mostly evils together to take down the mage epic mob in OT was tough because of people that needed or wanted their Overthere faction.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

They were not roleplaying a contributing member of society, or a doctor or nurse, or Mother Teresa, but they were roleplaying. <P>What I'm saying is, don't view roleplaying as painting yourself into a corner. Its not behaving a particular way following a particular contrived rule like, "trolls don't like frogs!" Its instead playing the role you choose, such as a troll who likes frogs. Doing either of those things is not "bad" roleplaying, one just takes more imagination than the other.<P>It was "bad" roleplaying, according to your definition, by the first very dark and very light complected couples to get married in the United States but someone did it anyway. Many of their fellows were saying, "Oh how could they betray us?" on both racial sides.<P>It would actually be MORE imaginitive roleplaying on the FV server to play a frog and troll grouping together and holding hands. Learn what the word really means if you don't know.<P>Enforcing people to behave a certain way, or only like certain groups, is the total opposite of roleplaying. It eliminates all extremes, such as Hitler or Mother Teresa. Those are still roles.<P>If you think enforcing behavior would be "enforcing roleplaying" then you, again, really need to learn what it means. Enforcing roleplaying would only be making people keep norrath about norrath and not talk about their playstation two games publically, or their new compact disk. It has nothing to do with someone deciding their character is going to be something besides a walking stereotype.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

To them heading hate and destruction is good.  They aren't just going to realize they are being evil just as much as we (RL) aren't going to suddenly wake up and realize that letting weaker members of society live is bad.

People who pick the "evil" races get several bonuses, but should pay for it.  Nowadays, thanks largely to Luclin and PoP, any faction issues can be ignored entirely.  Sure, a DE necro walking into freeport is going to die, but now theres no NEED to try to walk into freeport.  Just go to the PoP book (easily accessed even though the towns should be guarding the things with their lives) then head over to PoK, and boom: everything you ever need.<P>They seem headed in the wrong direction.  Instead, they should make grouping involve faction: KOS factions should be prevented from grouping or assisting, dubious should get some sort of penalty, and maybe ally faction gets a bonus?  It should be enough just to spark animosity between races without the full-blown race war on a couple servers.<P>I'd hope they would do something more about this in EQ2, but I suspect they'll take their current bad concept and go further with it.<P>Roleplaying is also about choices and consequences, but theres a decided lack of consequences around.  Heck, I even know a tunarean cleric KOS in PoG and Felwithe, and she doesn't even care.<P>&gt; What I'm saying is, don't view roleplaying as <BR>&gt; painting yourself into a corner. Its not <BR>&gt; behaving a particular way following a <BR>&gt; particular contrived rule like, "trolls don't <BR>&gt; like frogs!" <P>Actually, thats the foundation of roleplaying.  You start with a stereotype and build from there.  True, you do have RP icons like Drizzt, for example, who was a "good guy", and an exception to the Dark Elves.  However, your statement is saying that because there was one exception to the rule, that everyone should be allowed to throw out the rule.  Far from it.  Everyone should in fact follow the stereotype as closely as possible, and realize that exceptions are rare.<P>Otherwise, well... you get stuck with the mess we have now.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

If you're playing your character however you feel then you're playing the role of yourself, not your character.  Though I don't entirely like the idea of playing in such a way, I can understand the point about coming up with roleplaying up some reason to ally with a member of an opposing race...  But people generally don't.  Iksar just hang out with Wood Elves, maybe because the people playing them know each other.  But when the other players see an Iksar hanging out at the PoD lift in Kelethin, it looks really out of place and as others have said, it ruins the RP atmosphere.  Read up on the lore of Iksar.  They hate all races other than their own.  One High Elf Paladin doesn't just come along and turn their world upside down.  I cannot agree more with InnorukSK's words.  Maybe I'm an old fashioned RP'er, but the world of EverQuest has such beautifully crafted lore and there is purpose to it.  Indeed, what is the point of all that back story if we just ignore it?  We all know that none of these races (save humans) exist in our modern world, correct?  The same goes for classes, items, etc...  In the real world do you venture out every day and slaughter every animal and bandit in sight for whatever quest items they might hold?  No.  So why bring modern day ideals of racial tolerance with you when you play?  When we play in the world of Norrath, let's play *in the world of Norrath*.  That's what I say, anyway.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

To me the highest form of roleplaying is playing like the place you exist in also actually exists. If it actually exists, your character has the free will to not be a clone.<P>Real world was an example. There are also examples in roleplaying, someone mentioned Drizz in Ad and D. There are even npc examples in Everquest itself, Ogre Boomba the big who is a freeport merchant, the froglok paladin in guk, the wood elf girl who is a merchant in freeport, the half elf bard in Erudin, the ogre "paladin" shipmate of the barbarian lady on the freeport docks.<P>Yeah, a barbarian would "never" be friends with an ogre yet you see them as part of the game world. Saying all players should be "forced" into not doing similar things themselves is silly and about as anti roleplay as you can get. Why make everyone be a cookie cutter character?<P>That iskar hanging out at the POD lift had to do one heck of a lot of faction work to be able to be there. How does that "ruin" the RP atmosphere? Free will means that someone will always go against the stereotypes of their people.<P>You better tell boomba the big that he is not "playing" in the world of Norrath. Does him being where he is ruin roleplaying for you also?<BR>Bronto Thudfoot?<P>Most people DO seem to follow the pattern, they don't bother to improve factions in other areas. That is what makes it so great when someone does.<BR>As a roleplayer you should look upon that iksar with a sense of wonder at his ability to be amongst your people, as well as possibly some distrust.

The roleplayer IS the 'rare' exception.<BR>Roleplaying DOES mean you play as yourself, as you would see your chosen role within a  certain upbringing, and coping with surounding situations.  If you can't get into it, you wouln't be probably playing for very long.  Imagination, and acting it out is what makes it work.<P>The lack of roleplaying also could be because soo many people are just concentrating on raising up their levels or hewing those mobs to aquire quest components, and forgetting to intereact with others.  Forcing people to group woun't necessarily create more roleplay either, and can actually cause more hassel at times.  (Some zones in middle of night on Stormhammer are essentially empty, ....bummer)<P>I tried roleplaying on Rallos as I think PVP should be part of the senario, and found that myself and others of like mind on that server are besest by those immature one who some would call 'grief' players.  An example...  As an iksar shadowknight, I expected other races to try to kill me...The high elf (enchanter I think) that rooted  and ran a few agrooed skeletons into me, then dotted, and then gave killing blow (inspite of self using shadow step), was playing smart, fare, and within what one would expect.  Then there was the gnome that ran through the zone, agrooing everything, and deliberetly running it into various characters on the Field of Bone.  Deliberately causing large amounts of experience loss because he "was bored".  And getting killed by your own kind farming you when you are low on health.  Ruins the roleplaying aspect.  The only way Sony will be able to fix this is if they make it so armor is not lootable and one's own race cannot pvp each other.<P>On 'evil' races.  Why is the race considered evil...check it out...it is because their 'god' is considered evil.  Iksar do not have any choice as to what god they are considered serving, but their evil is more along the lines of being harsh in order to just survive.  If anything Iksar monks and beastlords should be given the option of being 'neutral'.  And it would make sense that an iksar that was 'good' would be outcast and found in other lands...<P>And how about those of the other 'dark' races that have chosen to be agnostic...the general predijuce would be against them due to the race being associated with an evil god, but the agnostics obviously are not...so them going out and working up better faction with others makes perfect sense.<P>One way to perhaps roleplay is to make up a story and then attempt playing it out as a character on the servers.  Tell me, how many of you complaning of the lack of roleplay are posting on Harpy's Head Tavern?  I have taken my half Tier'Dal cursed undead shadowknight and created him as a human sk out of Freeport.  Playing him as before he becomes cursed, undead, and repentent, that is for the future...invited to a guild that was a rather nice one, would have liked to join, and  told  them that I would like to join, but had to take place in the future, as have to join  a 'nasty' guild first.<BR>For a shadowknight to join with a group that has a paladin makes perfect sense....the unscrupulous shadowknight will use everyone, and everything to obtain his goals, and he can always challange the paladin to a duel afterwards, if the paladin doesn't do so first.   Just keep the insults and curses creative, not profane...<P>D'Ron Karr,<BR>(not) at your service.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Why does VI write all this lore when nobody even pays attention to it.</font><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Because they decided that everyone should be dependant on each other and that it should take an insane amount of XP and gear to reach the pinacle of the game.<P>Most of the lore is so contridictory anyway that paying attention to it causes migraines. It is like they had five people write all this garbage but werent allowed to exchange their ideas with each other. Stuff like dragons arent supposed to kill each other, but they can hire players to do it and them reward them?<P>IMO, the lore in the game was only put there to make their shallow and static world seem deeper. I think they failed. Sure RP is fun, but the games isnt a RP game. If staying level 30 forever and sitting around conversing in RP speak with others is fun for you, then more power to you. But you could accomplish the exact same thing using a chat room. High level content was meant to be accessed. Hardcore roleplayers more or less take away the chance to see it and vanquish mighty foes because they are roleplayers. If this was a RP game, then RPers wouldn't be removed from the majority of the game.<P>To advance you need to group with opposing races/classes. But you can RP it. THe lore is so limiting that it would be hard to roleplay many races. Especially Dark Elves and Iksar. Dark Elves are supposed to know only hate, but yet, many factions in neriak view my DE's are warmly or kindly. The guides in game are just that. They are a starting point, a character should grow and change view as he progresses. Just like in RL, kids are usually very sheltered but when they go off to college or the military or whatever their perspectives change. Just like it should in EQ.<P>I think RPers really need to understand that this isnt a RP game. They might actually enjoy the GAME, instead of just interaction. If you don't want to group with certain races/classes then by all means go ahead, but how does other people playing their roles differently( just because you don't like it doesnt mean it isnt RP) affect you in any way? <P>It actually wouldn't be all that hard to turn EQ into a decent RPG.<P>They need to allow players to change religions. You can RP that your DE now worships Tunare but Tunare or her treehugging minions won't buy it. They need to add gameplay mechanics so it can actually happen.<P>Rare spawns and rare drops need to be abolished. Nothing ruins RP faster then having to kill the same named mob over and over and over to get a quest drop.<P>Allow players to raid and control cities and zones. It can't be a RP world if players can't affect anything in the game. The world is a static background, nothing more. There are a few player controlled events that can alter a zone, but it is done in a very static and constricting way, Do X and Y will happen, every time.<P>Things like that might make the lore of the game and RP more relevant. As it stands, EQ is just a huge hack and slash game. And just because something doesn't follow your definition of RP doesn't meant that it isn't. Most roleplayers need to stop being so stodgy and close-minded, and buying a sense of humor wouldn't hurt either.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/tongue.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

One of the goals of my dark elf rogue is to be accepted in every city with a rogue's guild. That includes cities like Kelethin and Halas. (I think those two will be the hardest.) But just because I can freely walk through North Freeport without being attacked by the paladins there doesn't mean I've seen a light.<P>My thought is that a rogue works best if he/she is accepted by others. The fact that the merchants in Rivervale judge me amiably means that I have successfully conned them. I don't see my rogue as either good or evil. More like scheming.<P>I do still have one prejudice though. High elves. In fact, I set up a hot key to make a not nice statement whenever I see one. Other races are just a means to an end.<P>So, by roleplaying my character, I naturally work to improve my faction even withsome of the "good" races. My one restriction is that I will not hurt any Neriak faction just to raise a "good" faction. That is roleplaying. I don't need someone deciding that my dark elf is not roleplaying if she ever does walk freely through Kelethin.<P>Xaedria. Daughter of Innoruuk.

"<P>I see what you're saying here, and it's a mostly true but very disheartening statement.  I think what we're talking about here is mainly Firiona Vie.  This is a roleplaying server.  (Yes, roleplaying PREFERRED simply because they can't police such a thing)  I wonder to myself every single day why people play on FV if they don't intend to roleplay.  There are plenty of other places to play if you don't intend to RP your character, so why come to a server that encourages RP and just do whatever you feel?  To me it's similar to a smoking/non-smoking section.  It's just fine with me if people smoke, but I don't like inhaling it because it makes things less pleasant for me and others who don't enjoy the smoke.  I much more enjoy an environment where everyone RP's, and though I realize that such a thing will never exist, I think people should have at least some consideration for that.<P>I just feel the need to comment and maybe clarify what I said before...  I said that if you do any old thing you please you're just playing the role of yourself, not your character, to which someone said that roleplaying DOES mean playing as yourself.  There's a certain amount of truth in that, but think for a moment.  Roleplaying means playing a role.  It's nearly the same as acting, with the exception that you are allowed to put a certain amount of yourself into the role.  But it has to be a balance of you and your character.  If it's all you, what happens to your character?  Then it's just people playing a game with no hint of the personality granted by the lore of the game world, no different from any Unreal Tournament or C&C.  Balance is the key.  No, you don't have to KOS any opposing race of your character if it's not in your personal designs, but to maintain that balance maybe you should have some real motivation for your High Elf to stroll up to an Iksar and ask to group, and it better be some good motivation for something that extreme, or the balance of the roleplaying is completely upset and you aren't roleplaying, which is fine too, in the appropriate place.<P>And on the subject of freedom to play...  Well actually I don't think I can say it any better than Tenbil did.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=036762&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=036762&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
