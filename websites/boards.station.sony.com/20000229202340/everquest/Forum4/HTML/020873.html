&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
</FONT><HR>Alright,<BR>   Let's just say right now that this document is trying to have no biased opinion, it's just simply trying to get you Rangers to see the "LIGHT" about your class.<BR>   Alright, well, rangers are very good from childhood to late 20's.  This is because they have spells to heal themselves and they could do fairly good melee for the MoB's their LvL.  Then they start sucking because first of all at that LvL (30's up) you are usually roaming the streets with 15-20 other people around your LvL.  Ranger's are just mini-Druids so a Lvl 34 Druid is wanted more than a LvL 34 Ranger because it has all the spells the Ranger has and more.  A LvL 34 Warrior, similarily, is wanted more than a LvL 34 Ranger because he could actually do some damage and melee.  This is the reason why Rangers start sucking later on in the game than the other "pure" classes for groups.  Because they suck more than the pure classes at everything, which kinda sux because at that LvL people group ALOT.<BR>    Rangers also have good track at the beginning that few other classes/races have.  This is a huge advantage to them in several ways (In early stages).  It lets them track MOB's to kill to complete a quest that gives them a item that will help with LvL advancement into the latter stages where they suck.  They can do a quest easier than any other class in Karana or any big zone when earlier than LvL 20, then druids and the other classes start taking over.  Then the tracking moves to Druids.<BR>    Rangers also have the legendary concept of being able to have the best bows.  This is pretty much true, as the TrueShot Bow is the best bow anybody could get.  However, at later lvls it doesnt even matter because spell casters could just nuke and even burn the enemy at a more effective rate than bowing.  Once again, this makes Rangers good till the late 20's.<BR>    Many people choose the Ranger for their versatility.  Being able to have good Melee, decent spells, and being able to used a variety of range weapons makes them what most people think as versatile.  But they suck at later lvls because they can't do anything as good as any warrior as a tank, or any pure spell caster as a caster.  Track becomes useless because Druids get it.  Just think about it, would you rather have a army where everybody does everything mediocre? like having pure Tanks in a real army of real life?  Or would you rather have special corps made for each purpose (EX. Infantry to take spy, APC's to carry infantry, SAM Sites especially powerful against air, etc.)  I would rather have the special corps as a squad (party) since if we encounter something special, somebody would be able to dispatch it well (EX. Clerics V.S. Undead).  Like I said, Rangers are very good SOLO machines, but once the MOBS for their lvl become too hard to solo, and parties are required many of the times, rangers lose their advantage to the pure classes, since the party works as a whole.<BR>    So what is my point in this whole thing?  You guys chose the Ranger for its amazing solo capabilities (versatility), early tracking abilties (so you could do quests easier, but useless for groups after LvL 20), and much more.  All I can say is the Ranger is a good tank with decent spells to provide for himself when soloing (which is usually done in early lvls) but not good enough at either melee or spell casting to fit into groups (mostly latter lvls).  Sure, you guys could say he could be used as a back up cleric. INEFFECTIVE!!!  All the spells the ranger gets a LvL 9 is practically useless to him at that LvL.  Oh well, they are 75% warrior and 25% spell caster.  As the previous post about how rangers pick and not pull, that is pretty true.  It's not worth losing 4000 HP for some little spells that a druid gets at LvL 14 (or something like that).  So you guys chose it, know that it is good SOLO but sucks for parties, and thats the end of it!<P>   What you guys are complaining about is to make it be able to solo at later levels too? Give me a break, every class has to have their disadvantage.  Like its harder at the beginning for spellcasters is a good example.  Well I end my arguement here, I will check this post hourly and respond to any conflicts hopefully.<P>Rashiq<BR>    </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>You don't play a high level or if you do you've never seen a Rangers in combat.<P>For one they are very strong in terms of PC versus PC.  A ranger could take any, yes ANY class at level 50 and have at least a 50/50 chance.  <P>But at the highend where the mobs hit VERY hard its all about AC or dealing damage FAST.  They can not compete with rogues or monks for damage and are about even in terms of melee damage with warriors.  Their spells are nice but very underpowered at high levels in groups where druids take the role of casting thorn, healing, and wolf forming.  Simply said any plane group would much prefer an SK, Paladin, Warrior, Rogue, or monk than a ranger who has the same HP as a rogue with considerably less spell abilities.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Yep, that is why I say they are good for solo, which is the case of PvP, (1v1, just root a warrior and kite him LoL).  THat is why they are a hybrid, and many people prefer pure classes later as they are better at what they do ;0 <P>Seems like I agree with you, just miscommunication.<P>Rashiq</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Rashiq, <P>It's obvious you have absolutely no clue as to why we're complaining.  Also I'll excuse you for knowing basically nothing about the Ranger class, because I can tell you don't play one.<P>I assure you the problem here is not about soloing, nor is it about what a ranger is capable of doing at a certain level etc.  The problem is about group viability.  As you've so eloquently stated, Rangers basically have the same abilities as a Druid/Warrior combo.  This is in fact true, and it's also true that we can do neither as well as the class for which is was designed.  This in itself is the problem -- What do Rangers have as a unique ability?  Nothing, and perhaps that was by design, but what we're arguing is that by the current design, we lack the significant abilities to perform a unique role.  Which in turn henders our group performance because we can't perform up to the standards to which a group is accustomed to for that task.  Our redition of that said role is usually inefficent, and sometimes ineffectual.<P>I'll give you short explanation of what a Ranger is capable of, and where they can be enchanced.<P>-HP: This is understandable, we're not supposed to be an excellant tank.  I have no problem tanking, but I'll give up the job to and play 4th sting tank.  I really see no need for improvement here really, perhaps some better buffs at later levels, or self only buffs.<P>-Melee DMG: We're IMO not up to par with Warrior, and seriously lag behind Monk, and Rogue.  We give up a considerable amount of hitpoints to deal more DMG, and we should deal more than PAL/SK and perhaps even warrior.  Granted we do get spells, but we often times do more with melee in the   time it takes to cast the spells.  So what's the points with casting a spell, except maybe to lure, or kite?  None, or not at least in combat.  Right?  I'm sure you can understand that.<P>-Unique ability: Ugh we don't have one.  Almost every class has at least 1 unique spell or skill, Rangers don't.  Verant should at least give us one, that might help.<P>-Archery and Bows:  I think bows and archery are a non issue, it's too volitile of an issue because of kiting and such -- If Verant wanted us to be archers, they'd have named the class that.<P>-Why do Rangers only get up to level 29 druid spells?  Our spells are given out of order circle wise.  Not to mention the only 29th (Immolate)spell we get has a very high resist rate, and other hybrids get up to level 39 spells.<P>Truthfully we need an increase in availability in weapons, which was promised some time ago.  Also we could stand an increase melee caps, as well as an over all increase in melee abilities (ie dmg).<P>If you ever play a Ranger into the higher levels then we'll talk, til then it'll be hard for you to understand.<P>Lvyn Silverbow<BR>Ranger<BR>Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>&gt;Rangers also have the legendary concept of being able to have the best bows. This is pretty much true, as the TrueShot Bow is the best bow anybody could get. <P>Not true, I think the darkwood cam bow has better stats.  And do not use archery as an argument for rangers.  In this game, archery is a JOKE.  It is not viable for killing anything.  And whichever ranger actually does bow kite, then they are idiots.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I thought for a minute there that Rangers were nerfed recently because they were too strong...about 1 month ago?<BR>Now they are too weak?<P>Well I understand your arguments, as now I play as a LvL 24 ranger, I must have not seen the world yet.<P>Yep, it is agreed that the ranger can deal TONS of damage because they are one of the few hybrids (correct me if im wrong) that can dual and double.<P>I agree that the lack of weapons for the ranger HAS TO BE INCREASED.  As I am fustrated using the Short Swd of Mor and a tentacle whip for my dual wield.<P>Now that I see your arguements, I should say that what most of us are asking for, since your spells are rendered useless, is to make up for it by more melee skills, to be more like 90% Warrior and 10% spell caster.  After thinking for a while, RANGER DOES HAVE TO BE REMODELED COMPLETELY.<P>And they should get a special ability, Like LoH of the Paladin and Back-Stab of the Rogue, but other than that, I see ur arguements are mainly to turn the Ranger into a warrior even more to make up for how useless their spells are.<P>I agree with you all now, seeing that Paladins are cleric / warrior combo, they are specially good against undead<P>Rogues are specially good in dungeons<P>uh...Rangers, druid / warrior combo, what good is that?<P>*smiles*<P>Rashiq</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>well, it seems to me verant is having a hard time defining the ranger class at higher levels, i am currently 23rd and im not really looking forward to 30+. The mobs i can solo now are fewer and fewer, and forget about soloing in dungeons.  We definately need more and better armor, not to mention better 1hs weps.  I think the tracking skill is one of the best reasons to play a ranger, but at higher levels, you need to be in a dungeon to get the really cool stuff, and the only thing tracking does is tell you if the mob your looking for has spawned, i pity the fool who tries to track something in a dungeon.  As for archery, its nice to have but its not as great as many people think, besides, the fletching skill gets VERY expensive at higher levels, and I dont think the cost justifies the damage.  I dont want to be a tank, and i am willing to give up some melee dmg for some REAL spells, but when i hit a mob for 15-17 dmg a hit and hes hitting me for 50-60 a hit, i see a problem.  Hopefully verant will see the light and make the ranger what it was supposed to be, a light tank and a junior druid.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

It adds dext to help the proc'ing weapons many rangers carry.  It adds strength so that you are not as easily encumbered.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I'm going to buzz you wrong there too.<P>Verant went out of their way to make us [b] appear[/b] that we're archers.  How, you ask?  Well, there is the documentation stating as such, BUT... I'm talking about in the frickin' game.  <P>I don't know what class you play, but have you ever glanced over to the left-hand side (when you're not in full screen mode)?  Ever notice what little animated picture is there?  It has something to do with your class, doesn't it?  If you're a warrior, you have a really cool sword indictating that you are melee fighter and will use weapons as such.  If you're a mage, you've got some spell-like things.  Shamen get the "dream-catcher" type deal indicating that their magic is more tribal in nature.  And what do rangers have there?  A nice, big, fat, juicy, BOW with a nice semi-fat, not-as-juicy arrow... with a spellbook underneath.<P>Hrmmmmm....  if that picture is supposed to sum you up as a class (whether you be a warrior, necro, etc) then what the hell are rangers?  We're either supposed to be archers, or Verant thinks we're pullers with weak spells.<P>So I hate to burst your bubble, but SOMEONE from Verant obviously thought the rangers were supposed to kick some arse with archery.<P>-Jais</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>A few points for all to remember when asking for hybrid class changes:<P>Verant has set as immutable design law that, no hybrid shall possess skill abilities in any area owned by either of it's parent classes, BETTER than either of those parent classes.<P>So, those of you who are doing so, stop asking to be better than a warrior in archery. Stop asking to do more melee damage than a warrior. You NEVER WILL.<P>Rangers do the most damage in melee of any hybrid class and do ALMOST the same damage as a warrior of equal level using the same weapons. In that instance the ranger has only a 5 point offense skill difference than the warrior does form level 20 to level 40, which is when both classes have dounble attack, duel wield and kick. Warriors do get criticals but those only occur in 3-4% of attacks so....no amazing biggie.<P>Rangers are the ONLY hybrid to get both duel wield AND double attack.But they generally have lower AC than the rest. Balance. You pay for your increased attack ability by putting your ass out in front. I find if more Hybrids of all sorts concentrated on getting the best AC items they could rather than on stat buff items they would do far better in overall combat. I knwo it worked literally WONDERS for me.<P>That having been said:<P>A) Rangers, as they currently are, have one major problem: High level tracking needs to be fixed so it is usable and sortable to the rangers need.<P>B) Rangers have NO NEED for a SINGLE SPECIAL 'CLASS DEFINING' SKILL. The clas as it stands doesn't need one. The request is strictly a 'grass is greener' one. Ask any Paladin and SK how much they RELY on their 'Class Defining' ability and they will tell you they do not. They are good to have of course but they are far from all powerful abilities. Especially at one use per hour and a half. A well played group will almost NEVER require a Paladins ability.<P>So appreciate what you have. You really have no NEED for more. Your class weakness' are there to balance your class Strength's.<P>That having been said if you STILL NEED a once per hour and a half, class ranger only skill I say do the same thing SK's and Paladins did: Lose one of your main combat skills. <P>Keep duel weild and lose double attack to get this Ranger only class skill usable once per hour and a half. That would be balanced with the rest of the hybrids.<P>I haveno idea what skill it would be mind you but if you really want it I think that losing double attack would be a good trade. It is at least in keeping with Hybrid design philosophy if you look at the rest.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Yes, but the difference is that Tracking is supposed to be our equivalent of LoH.  SoW is not an issue here since that is just one of the spells we get.  Considering that at the level we get SoW we are only just getting our best healing spell (all 90 points of it) while paladins are healing on par with high level Shamans, there's no real comparison there.  The issue is clear, they *must* fix our tracking.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>First of all, I myself was totally in favor of the paladin improvements.  A paladin *should* tank better than a ranger, and I don't mind the fact that a paladin 5 levels lower than me can taunt off me at will.  I am interested in doing more damage, and that's where I believe we should get an upgrade...either in terms of weapons we can use (and there are some new ones coming I'm hoping will be good) or with higher caps on things like riposte.<P>Even if we don't get a damage upgrade, I still think we need two things:<P>1) An improvement to tracking (enough has been said on this issue, I won't rehash.)<P>2) Some type of unique high level spell or ability that would set us apart from the other hybrids.  My personal vote for this would be that at level 49, rangers get evac to butcherblock and south ro.  Though perhaps more in line with the paladin's ability to revive would be personal gates to these places...but the point of the evac is that it would give allow us to bring something to the table for high level groups, especially if a wizard or druid is lacking (or dead  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Freem<BR>Mithaniel Marr<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
