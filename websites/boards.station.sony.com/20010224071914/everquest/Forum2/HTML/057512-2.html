</FONT><HR>Xelene, this spell could easily be made unattractive for gaining xp.  How?  Simply add a very high mana cost and, as I DID remember to mention, a high RECAST.  I expect that my suggestion, if implemented, would be regarded as trash by most magicians anyway.  All it would be is an option(not a very good one) in an emergancy.  An option that fits the character of the mage class, and doesn't help in their soloing efficiency.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

In order to be high enough that it wouldn't be attractive, ever, to use it in an attack, it would be high enough that if you had that kind of mana you wouldn't be in this situation.  It's not something you'd have memmed, so it wouldn't help you.<P>Besides, that totally avoids the point that MAGES DON'T NEED ANY HELP ESCAPING.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Xelene...please then answer my points if mages don't need help escaping.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Okay, so a melee is more screwed for travelling...but if you're a melee you don't EXPECT to be able to use magic to get the **** out of dodge.  Monks can FD.  The classes left without any kind of escape while travelling are rogue (they have hide/sneak but see invis goes through it), warrior and mage.  Hell, at least warriors have some HP and AC to make it to the zone with.  Sorry, but in the interests of (a) class balance and (b) pure travel survivability (as I said, particularly for the uncared about PvPers) mages need a getaway.<P>Lzoril<BR>Elven Empire</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Tasmin-DB,<P>You may be right that mages are more "travel challenged" than the other int casters.  Really, I can only see wizards as having a particular advantage over the others, but whatever, I won't bother to try to convince you otherwise.<P>But that doesn't mean that mages need to be better.<P>Wizards are the worst at pets... they don't get any.  Even Enchanters, whose Animations are the rabid chihuahua of pets, get Charm.  So, therefore, wizards need pets?<P>Mages have, arguably, the best pets.  Certainly the fact that they have four flavors to choose from situationally is nice.  Do all the int casters have to have as good pets as the mages to be balanced?<P>Enchanters are the best at crowd control.  Do all int casters have to be as good at crowd control to be balanced?<P>The point to "balance" is that NOT EVERYONE DOES EVERYTHING.  If Mages need help getting across a zone, then so be it.  If that's the *only* thing that mages need help with... they're way more independent than anyone else.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>HammeyAneggs,<P>You are right about all the great things bards can do.<P>BTW, for those who are less familiar, that nifty charm ability is something you just got at level 27.<P>But it's *hard* to do well, correct?<P>And, do you find that it's harder, or easier, to do all the things mages can do to stay alive?<P>BTW, I would definitely take issue with the idea that it's "easier" to solo with a bard.  A mage can repeat the same actions over and over with similar mobs, and the fight will almost always go the same.  A string of fizzles when the pet's getting whomped and needs a heal might cause a run for the zone... but generally, this happens maybe once in a few hours.<P>Charm soloing with my bard works great about 3/4th of the time; the rest of the time I end up running for the zone.  The resist rate on the song is pretty high, even with a cha of 144... I can charm some reds as reliably as some blues, but one resist will bring me low enough on health that I have to run.  If I misjudge which mob is stronger and have to switch pets, I have to kite around.  But most importantly, I have to do something (i.e. recharm) every 10-15 seconds... a mage can kill a mob by nuking twice and letting the pet do the rest.<P>It's fun as heck, and honestly, I'm not complaining.  But that's my point... *I'm* not complaining about *my* class, which is great fun and I love.  I wish these people, who in many ways have it easier, would stop complaining too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, soloing low blues is better xp for the associated downtime.  <P>I can solo a low blue with 2 nukes and be ready for adds if they show up.  If I kill 3 or 4 on a full bar of mana, it will probably give me most of a blue bubble of xp.  I could solo one, maybe 2 high blues with an earth pet in the same amount of mana.

</FONT><HR>Xelene,<P>At your level as a mage, you have a reasonable argument.  Mages pre-50 are fairly well-balanced, though we die a hell of a lot more often than you'd think.  Specifically though, levels 34 through 43 we drop comparably in performance.  By 44, this picks up again until 51.  Bards also die a lot, but most of the time this should be in indoor and not outdoor zones.  I have both classes post 50 (mage 57, bard 54), and bards do amazing things which enable them to stay alive whereas the mage simply eats the death.  In fact, a pet is usually a poor means of escape.  In the case of single mobs, you generally buy yourself enough time to gate or outrun the mob to zone.  With multiple mobs (you know, they call them Trains), mages no longer have the benefit of their pet pulling the mobs off of them.  There are times I have been able to successfully root and pull off my earth pets to root the next one, but I'm getting wacked the entire time (my mage hps are nearly 1700 self-buffed for good reason).  This takes extraordinary timing, experience, and mostly just luck.  AoE fear whether in a dungeon or outdoors, and I now have enough room to run to zone.  I consider bards the most challenging class to play maintenance-wise.  Triple twisting should be your mantra.  If you have the time to chain/fear, you allow yourself fairly high chances of living through a train.  Ok, now explain to me about this mage not having a need to escape.  Do you believe we prefer death so easily?  Especially above 50th level, you will find more often than not, you simply die.  There is no quick-fix as a mage, and you either get the stats to make it easier to live or you suffer through the rez/revivi.  But do attempt to explain lack of necessity, indoors or outdoors, to run when all other classes would do so.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Also, bard with only 144 cha is just as ineffective as an enchanter with 144 cha.  If you have the effects breaking too quickly, work toward 200 cha.  With the levels, the stats should come, but they certainly aren't going to do much good with substandard primary abilities.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree - magician's should get some form of AE snare or AE root.  When you compare magicians against necros(the class most similarly designed like a magician) they are ludicrous. <P><BR>Necros get:<BR>Shadow Step<BR>Feign Death<BR>Engulfing Darkness (snare)<BR>Fear<BR>Screaming Terror<BR>Root<BR>Gate<P>Magician's get:<BR>Gate<P>The logical answer is for Verant to convert the root cast by mage earth pets to an AE root and/or add an AE snare spell to one of the other magician pets.  Combine the water pet ice spell with an AE snare component.<P>Verant really didn't expend a lot of creative energy in designing magicians.  They deserve a break.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057512-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057512.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057512-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057512&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057512&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
