</FONT><HR>Ok lets look at the numbers.  I am using the spell stats from castersrealm for my calculations, if they are incorrect please post a URL stating otherwise.<P>I am using the equation <P>(mana cost of lifetap)/(mana given per tick of lich) = (number of ticks need to get mana) * (hitpoints lost per tick) =  (total lost hitpoints)<P><BR>(amount of hitpoints gained from lifetap) - (total lost hitpoints lost to lich) = Hitpoint efficiency<P>Call of Bones - takes 16 hps and gives 8 mana, costs 5 mana to cast (lvl 34 spell)<BR>Drain Spirit  - Does 226 dmg and gives 226 hps max costs 189 mana to cast. (lvl 39 spell)<P>Amount of hps lost to get to enough mana to cast Drain Spirit.<BR>189/8 = 23.7 * 16 = 378hitpoints lost (not counting mana to cast since neglidgable)<P>Effect of casting one drain spirit after liching to get enough mana to cast drain spirit.<BR>-378hps(lost) + 226(gained) = -152hps(lost)<BR>and we are now back to 0mana.  <P>So everytime we use call of bones/Lifetap combo we are actually loosing 152 hps, which we will eventually have to sit and med to get back up.<P>Ok now Lich<P>Lich - Takes 32hps and gives 20mana (mana cost 5 and lvl 49 spell)<BR>Drain Soul - Does 338 dmg and gives 338hps (costs 225 mana lvl 49 spell)<P>Amount of hitpoints lost from liching to get enough mana to lifetap to get hitpoints back.<BR>225/20 = 11.25 * 32 = 360<P>Effect of casting one Drain Soul to regain hps<BR>-360hps + 338 hps = -22hps <BR>and we are at 0 mana again<P>Demi Lich (Lvl 60)<BR>Demi Lich -  looses 48 hps and gain 31mana<BR>Touch of Night - Does 720 dmg and gives 720 hps for 405 mana <P>Amount of hps lost to cast one Touch of Night<BR>405/31 = 13.06 * 48 = 627.1hps<P>Effect of casting one touch of night<BR>-627.1 + 720hps = 92hps<P>Arch lich<BR>does roughly the same as lich at 49, only difference is 31hps taken instead of 32<P><BR>So as you can see, Lich doesnt even equal itself out until Lvl 60, when we cant lifetap much of anything we will be using it on anyway.  Clarity 2 gives ll mana for no hps with means you will always gain mana, and never have to worry about trying to get hitpoints back, and this is true for all of the clarity line.  From these calculations, the lich line is actually less efficient than the clarity line.  <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>That's why you don't use taps to heal your Lich damage, you use Bond of Death/Vexing.<P>Bond of Death is 360 mana for 720 damage, and 720 health returned to you over 9 ticks.<P>Over 9 ticks, Lich will give back 180 mana (not including Meditation) and take 288 health.  <P>Net effect of Lich + Bond of Death = 720 damage done, 432 HP healed, for less than 180 mana spent.  Basically, a damage ratio of 4:1 while also healing you at least halfway.<P>Meditating while your Bond + Lich is going only increases the efficiency due to extra regen and meditation.<P>This is after they "fix" Lich, btw, as it is now it is even more efficient.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A few things.<P>#1.  Forget Castersrealm, forget whatever you parsed from the spdat.eff.  Test the spells in game and see what they do to your health and mana.  Those of you saying lich takes 32 hps per tick now...you are wrong.<P>#2.  "Sorry but some of you necros need to learn math. Any necro that stops using lich post-nerf, is an idiot. It will still be far superior to C2 for most situations."<P>Okay, let's do the math for the new lich.<P>According to Absor, the new lich will have a 3:2 hp:mana ratio instead of 1:1.  That means, where it takes 24 hps and gives 24 mana per tick now, it will take 36 hps and give 24 mana.<P>Again, sitting regen post-50 is 5 hp per tick.  So we have 31 hps to replenish.<P>Bond of death, again, taps two hps for every point of mana.  So, it will cost 15.5 mana per tick to replace the 31 hps lost.<P>Total mana regen = 24 - 15.5 = 8.5 mana per tick.<P>Clarity 2 is 12 mana per tick.<P>#3.  "Free damage!"  Maybe so, but it's not that much.  Compare:<P>- bond of death, 720 damage over 9 ticks<P>- envenomed bolt, 1100 damage over 7 ticks<P>- splurt, 1600 damage over 15 ticks<P>Clearly, this is not a necro's primary source of damage.<P>Also, consider that dots need to land near the start of a fight to do full damage.  However, bond of death will not achieve its full effectiveness unless you are down 1-1.5 bubbles when you cast it (depending on how much your hps are buffed), because it will tap much faster than lich will take hps away.  The chance of you hitting this point just as a fight with a mob starts is somewhat slim; thus, you have to choose between:<P>a) cast bond of death early, and lose efficiency (but do full damage)<P>b) cast bond whenever you hit that point, even if a mob is low, sacrificing damage<P>c) let your hps run down until the next fight, which may or may not make you vulnerable (depending on what buffs you have, how quickly pulls are coming, etc)<P>d) use deflux instead of bond.  You avoid the difficulties of a dot, as deflux is a straight tap.  However, it taps 3 hps for every two mana spent, however, and as such is much less efficient as far as mana regen goes.<P>Finally, if you want to maintain efficiency with bond while grouped, you can't cast it every fight.  You have to let your hps drain down first, and lich does so at a constant rate.<P>Bond of Death + Lich may allow a necro to do "free damage", but that damage is very limited in nature.<P>Aatudien, 54 necro, Lanys</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

We would say ok, just don't nerf lich and we will be alright.  Don't worry about giving us anymore just don't nerf lich.  Well, its working, we would be content now to just have a spell the same as it has been for 2 years. <P> I just wish absor would have said, necros are balanced as they are now and no changes will be made or whatever.  Instead he decided to taunt us with a nerf to quit us down about getting no or few positive class changes.  Smart move on his part I guess.  <P>Only problem with necros is against mobs that resist lifetaps(will resist most other spells if they resist our lifetaps).  Against these mobs we pretty much watch the battle like its a show.

</FONT><HR>Where do you get your information from Post_Toasties?  Whenever I cast cannibalize, it takes off exactly 50 hps.  Additionally, I have to stand to cast that spell, which needs to be timed in between ticks or I miss the precious sitting multiplier to my mana and hp regen.  Comparing the two is like comparing apples and oranges.  Quit trying to draw attention away from your own class.  In my opinion, the ONLY thing that necros can complain about is their lack or roles in high lvl encounter events.  Other than that, your complaints are needless drains of resources. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>All I want to say is, you ivory tower people need to learn the necro class before you open your big mouth.<P>There is no comparing your so-called efficiency except in one instance: soloing.  No sane necro is going to wait till his health is at 2 bubbles and then cast Bond of Death in a group with 130+ double hitting mobs, which is the only way your efficiency theorems will work because, as I've said so many times before, BoD/Lifetaps/Lich only carries its own weight if the extra hp aren't wasted, and the only way to do that is to not operate at maxium hp at ANY time.<P>Actually waiting for your health to get to 2 bubbles is even less efficient than if you had just gotten clarity II and regenned mana like a normal person.  I won't deny that Lich/Demilich are useful spells that surpass Clarity II, but to think that they are more efficient to a necro in groups is near-sighted.  Deflux is not a good damage spell and neither are BoD/Vex/Touch of Night.  You don't loose 0 mana by using deflux and lich in conjunctions, because guess what happens after you deflux 1 or 2 times? That's right, you're at full health, and have to wait for lich to take your health down by 300 before casting the spell again.<P>You shouldn't need to do number crunching to know that there is a problem with the necro class, but then again most people speak out on things they have no idea of, such as I've seen so many times on mage/wizard threads where people complain that mage pets are overpowered or wiz nukes are balanced - guess what, they're not.<BR>  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It has really nothing to do with Eduin's post.<P>If Eduin gets rather unfriendly responses that is because he leads a personal one man charge to get Necros nerfed.

However, in case you didn't know this, if you are under a certain amount of health and you cast a offensive spell on a mob - it can FRENZY on you, which means it won't stop attacking you regardless of taunts.  This has happened far too much for me to consider casting an offensive spell while below 2 bubs of health worthwhile.  It has nothing to do with skill, which I don't know why you mentioned.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>/sigh... Etadanik you are combining two completely different situations into one.  Again I said 'When I solo I will lich down to 1/2 HPs' not when I am grouped.<P>I know about mobs tactics to hit Player with low HPs and in groups I am more then able to keep well above 80% HPs with Lich, Regrowth and just using Taps or Vexing [while Shadow pacting]. So that is not an issue.<P>While you are soloing 'Frezny' is a non issue because you will most likely be Fear kiting or Root/Doting. That is when I will Lich down to 1/2 HPs and use Vexing.<P>That seems to be the confusion  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Bril</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Heh Brij I wasn't referring to your original comment, I was referring to the later comment where you dismissed my assertion that the efficiency of Lich is often misinterpreted because people think necros always seems to waste no health - which isn't true.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
