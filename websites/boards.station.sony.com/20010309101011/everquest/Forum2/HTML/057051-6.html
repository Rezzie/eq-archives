</FONT><HR>I strongly suggest that everyone here, ESPECIALLY Absor, go check out the post stating that CLASS balance isn't a problem, GAME balance is.<P>Basically, necromancers want to be able to do something on the high level raids besides play Duracell battery.  We want to be able to hurt the mobs.<P>If you'll notice, mages are having pretty much the same problem we are. I believe ALL of the int casters are.  The high level mobs are so MR that only melee really has a chance against them, and since pathing sucks and our pets are cowards, we can't use those either.<P>It's not the class that needs to be fixed, it's the mobs.  VI needs to make it so that our spells actually STICK, and our pets can actually be USED.<P>One thing that boggles my mind is the whole idea that unresistable lifetaps are going to be somehow unbalancing and open to exploit in the 50+ game whereas in the 1- 49 game they're fine. What, are they afraid that necros are going to take out Trakanon with our mana-inefficient 350 damage lifetaps, just because he can't resist them? Please.<P>But that brings me back to my original point; even if you decide not to make them unresistable, at least make it so they have a chance to actually hurt them mob.  Every other caster class is screaming for the same thing.  Casters can't even touch half of these damn things.<P>In the 1 -49 game I rarely had trouble getting a group, and I was considered a valuable member in the groups I was in.  Why? Necromancers could dot for nice damage (even if we only got one dot in per fight), lifetap for nice damage, our pet was good in melee, and we were pretty self-sufficient.<P>Now, in the 50+ game, everything that made us necromancers is taken away. We can't lifetap, because it gets resisted constantly. We can't dot, because it gets resisted constantly AND makes the mobs disappear. We can't use our pets due to pathing bugs and the fact that they're Feared way to easily.  Mages get the same problem; their nukes don't hit and they can't use their pets.  Wizards are pretty much just there for ports and evacs.<P>Just let us play necromancers in the 50+ game the same way we did in the 1 -49 game. That's all we ask.  That's all I think ANY class asks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'd like to agree with everything Cyanite has just said.  I too find that group members are surprised at the variety of things that I can do - I often wish I had more spell slots.<P>However I am becoming increasingly frustrated with the fact that it seems that not only are we not going to get anything extra for our class but may in fact be nerfed further.<P>I agree that up to level 25 I was able to solo extremely effectively (although not as well as a druid).  After this stage I found that more and more MOBs would resist darkness and as a result I would die more often.  Since then I have been exclusively grouping my necro (am now level 40).<P>It is tough finding a group as no one wants a necro when they could have just about any class who does what we can only better.  We do have the range of spells but not enough people appreciate what we can do.<P>If we are meant to be a solo class then how is it that I am being forced to group as it is the only reliable way to get experience?  How is it also that despite being advertised by Verant as the solo class so many other classes out-solo us past level 25?  Please either give us better abilities to help in a group to make us more in demand or at least allow us to be able to solo without dying!<P>However, it seems that despite all the intelligent postings made here we will end up with another nerf.  Makes me think why doesn't Verant be done with it and just delete the necro class and all the necros out there and make us start from scratch with another more 'popular' class.<P>I'm just fed up with getting nerfed to such a state we are more or less useless whilst Verant still claims that we are the most overpowered class in the game.  Makes me wonder if anyone there has actually ever played a necro beyond level 25.  Give it a try - you might be surprised at our lack of relative weakness at soloing and the extreme lack of demand for our class.  When was the last time you saw a shout saying 'Group looking for Necro around level 40?'  Never.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I have read a lot of post from both the necromancer's community and VI representatives about what is wrong or right with the necromancer class. Unfortunately for us it is quite true that when the game was released the necromancer was a very overpowered class and quite deservedly got a good beating with the nerf stick. However it now seems that VI have developed a nerf mentality towards our class or have mislaid the enhancement stick.  I came to the class after most of the major nerfs happened but was still impressed with how well the necromancer could be played and 51 levels later I am still enjoying it.  My opinion about the necromancer class balance is pre 50 we are completely balanced and if we are more powerful than others, their class needs an improvement not ours a nerf.  Post 50 the ball game starts to change and in fact in a lot of cases the stadium has been rebuilt and the rule book thrown away. I have read from several VI representatives that the necromancer is primarily a solo class and we suffer for this at later levels (post 57) and this, they maintain, is how the class should be.  However in the opening statement to magicians it clearly states that magicians can solo quite well to 60 and that is fine for them to do so, and in fact they're still going to improve the class such that they can also contribute to groups. Well to be honest that is fantastic and I'm very happy for magicians that they are getting this sort of enhancement I just wish that necromancers and indeed all classes were viewed this favourably.  To be honest I'm not sure what will make necromancers more beneficial to raids but no more powerful and up until 57 no more power is needed.  However I do see some very basic things that need to happen.  Among these is to have the pet enhancements that magicians get applied to us this would go a long way to improve our ability in a raid situation whilst not making us more powerful.  I will try and list a few other things that I would like to see, if we are going to be a support class on big raids (a role I can accept happily) then I would like the tools to be able to do the job properly.<P>Firstly I would like to have no changes made to Lich line of spells in any way shape or form<P>Make vampiric curse castable on others. This would be a very valuable group buff and be used throughout the necromancer's life.  As this is also a melee buff will add no power to the necromancer.<P>Apply magician pet enhancement to necromancer pets.  A big complaint is that necromancers don't do any damage on raids.  Well if the necromancers pets were immune to fear (starting at level 49) this would greatly contribute to the damage we could do. I also fell the pets post 49 need a slight upgrade in power.<P>Screaming terror.  This is a great spell and should have an upgrade in the 50's this would not make us a chanter replacement but allow us to help chanters out in a sticky situation.  Nothing major in the upgrade. Maybe +10 seconds to the duration, make it slightly less resistible and have a slightly greater chance of a memory wipe.<P>Essence emeralds.  My first reaction to this spell was not good but after listening to guild mates and friends I have come around a bit.  However this is a spell that requires another member of the paying public to give up their time such that a necromancer can cast a spell.  This is something I have a very hard time accepting.  No other class needs to ask this sort of sacrifice from anyone else so they can cast spells and necromancers should not have to either.  I do agree though that the casting cost for convergence should be high, how high I am not sure.  What to do about the other spells that require an EE I am not sure perhaps someone else can come up with a good idea. <P>Convergence.  Change the spell to require 2 components, a coffin (different to summon corpse coffin) and essence emerald. Make the coffins cost about 300/500pp. Have essence emeralds require the same component but reduce the cost by only causing a 25% exp loss or lower the level of player that sacrifice can be cast upon to 30.  This combined cost will have the same effect as having a complete experience loss sacrifice in that will still be much cheaper and easier for all classes, including the necromancer, to get a rez from a cleric but in an emergency situation a necromancer rez can be used.  Requiring a coffin also has a very undead/necromancer feel to it and the sacrifice element is kept.<P>A lot of people have asked for life taps to be made unresistible so we can be better mana batteries on BGH, to be honest I don't think its great idea.  It would allow necromancers to do to much damage to fast.  However we do need to improve our mana battery ability and for this I would like to see 2 things happen.  Make DoT life taps a lot less resistible (i.e. so they can land on boss mobs) so that any necromancer on a hunt can reclaim life and make more mana.  This would restrict the amount of damage we do whilst making us more valuable to the raid.  Secondly I would like to see the ratio of mana transfer line improved. Ideally a 3:2 ration would be best but I think this may be slightly overpowering so a 2:1 would probably be the way to go. <P>Scent debuff line make them slightly less resisted and reduce the amount of aggro they cause for the caster.  At present I never use any of the scent debuff primarily because they never stick.  When I have had them stick however I usually kills me because of the amount of aggro that is generated no one can taunt the mob off of me.<P>Look at the darkness line of spells. The level 49 spell is resisted much more than level 29. OK it does more damage but most people use this spell for its snare component rather than damage. I would suggest a much smaller damage increase in the spell in exchange for reducing its resistibility and casting time.<P>Post 57 enhancements to solo. As already stated in the opening paragraph. It was written in the opening statement to magicians that they can solo to 60 and that it is OK for them to do this. VI representatives have also written that it is not OK for necromancers to solo to 60 and we should pay for our soloing ability starting at level 57. I see a slight contradiction here. To be honest we are no longer the kings of solo, we now share that crown with a number of other classes namely Wizards, Druids, Magicians and to a lesser extent some of the other casting classes. If we are supposed to be the solo class of EQ this either needs to be addressed or used in our fervour to get better group oriented spells.  As I am not level 57 + and don't think I ever will be I would like my higher level brethren to contribute here.  However, it is about time that, the myth that necromancers are the all-powerful class of EQ now needs to be shown as just that, a myth.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Just to restate something I posted quite a while ago, and I just want to be brief and concise about it.<P>I want one thing.  Give people a reason to invite me into a group (or raid).  Make necros valuable to a group.<P>One note on that, if my place is to be a mana battery (god I hope not) it needs improving, NOT nerfing (cough-litch-cough .. yes, if you nerf litch it hurts us as batteries).  I can have an ok effect on 1 caster's mana but put 2 casters in the group/raid that want pumpin and I might as well not be there.  Enchanters are much better at giving out mana through clarity en-masse and they can mez & buff to boot.<P>Oh, and people don't need us for corpse summoning anymore, they're better off getting an SK.  They can do that too and can tank to boot.  Don't get me wrong, I congratulated my SK friends when they got it, but it made me ill, cause that's a nerf too.  Not a direct one, but you took something that made us unique and you soiled it by giving it to another class.  You made us less unique and thereby less useful, and that's a nerf no matter how you try to talk around it.<P>So, given that, I ask again, please give groups a reason to want a necro.
