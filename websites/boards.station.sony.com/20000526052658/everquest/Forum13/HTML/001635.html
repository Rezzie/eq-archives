&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Crippling blow is a warrior only ability that was recently added. For those of you who don't know what it is, crippling blow is the ability to land quad damage hits ONLY when a warrior is berserk.<P>There is a serious problem here on how "rare" this ability happens, and I think it should be changed to happen at any given time. <P>Warriors DO NOT solo past 12 or so. I could see crippling blow when berserk be useful when a warrior solos and fights past the 2 bubble, fight or flee decision time. But that fact is, they do not solo because downtimes are way too great and without twinked equip, it's just too dangerous.<P>This leads us to Situation #2, the grouped warrior. Warriors almost always are grouped with healers. Now, in order for a warrior to crippling blow, he has to DANGEROUSLY go under 2 bubbles of health. But with a healer in the group, THIS NEVER HAPPENS unless the fight is WAY TOO CLOSE, or they are going to die anyway. Healers keep warriors and other tanks ABOVE 2 bubbles because it's not worth the risk, and if they do not, they are FAILING as a group member. Therefore, warriors NEVER crippling blow, their ability is a complete, and TOTAL waste.<P>Now, if you teach a cleric to "let you go berserk," you are really playing dangerous. When your health dives under 2 bubbles, your stats start taking a hit. Yes, you may be berserk and may fight better, but your agility goes WAY DOWN, and likewise your AC does too. When your AC is low, you have a much better chance for taking max damage, and it is so much easier for you to lose those last 2 bubbles of health than it was the first 2 bubbles. At one moment, you may be berserk and doing fine, then WHAM, double attacked max damage... cleric starts to heal ya, DOUBLE MAX DAMAGE, dead.<P>Whoever designed Crippling blow, IMHO, did not think it through. It should NOT be tied to berserk. It should be an ability that occurs ANYTIME, slightly rarer than critical hit. From my warriors career from 7-20, I have seen 3 crippling blows. One when I pulled 2 aqua goblins by accident and had to fight while berserk. The other time was when I was jumped by a white gargoyle and died, but I scored two crippling blows. Way to go! I'm still dead. Does it really make sense that a warrior will score a more powerful shot when he's almost dead? No. <P>I cannot agree with you, Gordon, when you said "warriors will be quite happy with Crippling blow" for such a rarely seen and anti-group mentality ability. Please look into this.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Personally i think it is prertty cool, in some situations i know i cannot run, and if i try it is going to make it harder for my group to beat the mob so i just suck it in and fight to the death, right before i do down i wouldnt mind beated that mob to a pulp. But that is me personally, i think the problem is that people want this to be a passive skill wich works like crit hits, but it is not, never will or never was planned this way.<P>What i think happed was warriors complained about Berserk making them DEAD meat, as it lowers AGI you get hit more and die faster when beserk than without, So what you have higher str with beserk, but if you cant hit it what use it it!<BR>SO Verant looksed at the situation and agreed to compromise, they didnt want to remove beserk instead they put crippleing blows wich works quite nicely. IT isnt ment to be a new warrior defining skill, but a complement to the beserk skill.<P>And if i look at it that way it works out nice, many hybrids want crippling blow but i do not, as all you have to say is you get beserk with it and they instantly say "no i want it without beserk" wich is not the point, it is a upgrade to beserk to calm down warriors and give them that little bit of extra security, since they have no way of escape (except death of cource) this skills works out quite nicely.<P>If you think it is wrong or bad then i personally think you are greedy, you did not make this game and have no say in it to be honest, if you wrote it, designed it then i would accept your advised but it is cleer what this skill is there for and to give warriors and extra attack it was not.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Personally I don't mind only getting the crippling blows when I am berserk.  However to say,<BR>"it is a upgrade to beserk to calm down warriors and give them that little bit of extra security, since they have no way of escape (except death of cource) this skills works out quite nicely."<BR>is completely incorrect.  I dual wield two reasonable swords, but the scarcity of a crippling blow happening whilst berserk (let alone more than one of them), and the rarity of that blow doing quad damage just does'nt make me feel any more 'secure'. I think the most damage that I managed on one blow was 53 but generally a lot lower - this is hardly likely to save my life whilst berserk; clearly I am taking a lot of damage to be berserk in the first place, so hitting the mob for 53 points of damage is unlikely to do me any favours.<P>IMHO the skill needs to be re-vamped to offer a higher success rate of doing more damage / and going off.<P>Braefar DeamonBlade<BR>Warrior 28th season<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Greedy? You are a bit out line. If I am offered an ability that the dev team brags about will make warriors "quite happy", I do not think I would see it happen LESS than THREE TIMES IN 10 LEVELS! I am NOT exagerrating. I have only seen it go off 3 times.<P>Berserk is a poor ability anyway. If you play the battle "that close", you and your group are pretty much over their head to begin with, or any crippling blows you make are just staving off the inevitable.<P>By themselves, "warriors have no way of escaping death", but it is pretty clear that warriors do not solo. And if they do, it's not very xp/time efficient since they can only bandage to half.<P>That's the problem, nuturing a warriors ability to go "berserk" is not a group-friendly tactic though it makes a warrior a better fighter. That's the dilemma. And it's not greedy to think something has to be done about it, especially for a class that no one complains is too powerful.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Personally, I've been fairly happy with crippling blow being the way that it is. Granted, I have been twinked, and I can still solo at 38 with the expenditure of a LOT of bandages. But I have still been in small groups that only had a druid or shaman for a healer, or that had to rely on paladins to heal, and crippling blows have saved my A$$ a few times. BTW, you only lose agility if you're under 100hp, not below 2 bars of life. And there have been some fights where I have been under 100 hp even, and a 200+ point crippling blow has saved me or my group. And then you've got to consider things like bad pulls or trains. Where either your healer is low on mana, or there's just too many things. In that case, it's not that your healer isn't doing their job (since there is no possible way they could) when you go berserk, and when you do go berserk, if you're like me, you hope to god that you pull off a huge crippling blow. I know it's not reliable, and you shouldn't depend on it, but it hasn't let me down in a situation where it might have won the fight.<P>And another thing, when carstien said that warriors have no way of escape (except death of course), I think he meant that if you're berserk, you can't really get out of that situation. We can't gate, or even shadow step (not like it would help that much). All we can hope for is an evac, a huge crippling blow, or we wait for death in situations like that.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Warriors can't solo past 12 or so? LOL! Well I know I am not the most experienced warrior, but I am still soloing at 15 and plan to do so for quite awhile.

</FONT><HR>As a level 49 troll warrior in full crafted, I'd just like to go on the record that the guy is totally full of crap regarding hill giants and seafuries.  If anyone out there wants to try this, you better keep your JBoots handy, cause you're gonna need em.  His friend is probably a Paladin, not a warrior.<P>But anyway, crippling blows and critical hits are eye candy, nothing more.  Verant has said in the past that these abilities do not effect the balance of the warrior class at all.  Put them in, take them away, it makes no difference, it's just meant to look pretty.<P>I have not once gotten a crippling blow that did any good.  If I'm under 2 bubbles of health for more than 5 seconds, it's because the cleric is dead and I'm about to follow suit, and even a hit for 300 damage with a Skarlon isn't going to dent a mob with 10k HP.<P>300 damage sounds like a lot.  It's pretty much the most you could expect out of a crit with a really good 2-hander.<P>Nevertheless, it's significantly less than a single nuke from any caster.  At level 49, a caster throwing a 300 damage nuke is just playing around.  For a warrior to hit like that, we gotta be almost dead.<P>IMO, a crippling blow should be tied to the health of the mob, not YOUR health.  So you can start landing crippling blows on a mob that's on it's last bubble of health.  More useful, makes sense.<P>Hopefully these effects will get more useful in the expansion.  Can't say I'm really expecting it though.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I agree that crippling blows don't suddenly make a mob thats owning you die.  But they do tip the scales in a close call (these happen, solo or non) and I believe they have a shot at stunning a mob too.  That never hurts.<P>One place they are fun tho is pvp and in duels.  In a good melee confrontation, a berserk warrior can make one helluva comeback and its fun to see.  Sortof an icing skill, like many melee player skills.  <P>Never know though, it might come back to haunt you in the post-50 game with disciplines etc if their mods stack with the effects of your berserker frenzy.. a warrior at &lt; 2 bubs might just be deadlier than ever before.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

We both have partial indo armor and both with yak or better. It took me down to 2 bubble and him down to 3 (it was hitting me more) before we killed it. I really doubt any warrior even an ogre with full indo and the bloodfire/claw combo could solo a sea fury... not yet anyway, lets see what expansion gives us.<P>BTW griffons are not out of the question to solo.

</FONT><HR>Ok, the original post was regarding crippling blows/berserker and usefullness.<P>I must say that getting INTO beserker mode gives a message to the surroundings that you are getting into some problems. Maybe it's not usefull, but in my opinion it is. People know that you are on low health (2bubs) and have a chanse to find you and heal you.  (since they can see that is it YOU that is on low health)<P>For example:<P>I am in the planes and the cleric/healer in my group goes down/Linkdead. I have the mob on me hitting me on the head. suddenly I go into beserker mode. Other healers hear this and try to locate me and keep me healed. We are talking here of 18-30 players in the planes.<P>Regarding crippling blows, if you strike a critical the surroundings hear this, the same counts for critical blows, people hear this and will try to heal you.<BR>I think in large amounts of people these cripplings are good to hear and have.<P>ok. it's a random thing regarding the cripplings, but first of all. warriors are NOT the damage dealers, but the tank!  It's nice if we can do some damage, but doing this does not mean we are the masters at this. <P>Also, Beserker mode and cripplings are for "free" so stop complaining about it. <P>- Xeladin -<BR>50th warrior<BR>Lanys T'vyl</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>well, streetsjr, your roommate must be playing some kind of trick on you.<P>let's compare & contrast for a minute.  to kill guard jendl (in west freeport), you either have to be a caster, or be a level 50 paladin/sk in almost full plains gear.  believe me, i saw doff (anyone on xegony knows him) kill guard jendl.  doff is a level 50 paladin in full plains armor, with fiery avenger, and several GM-only items.  he killed guard jendl, but he only had like 300 HPs left at the end of the battle.<P>doff is a very lucky guy.  most people will never see a full suit of plains armor, or a fiery avenger.  to say that your roommate can "go toe to toe with slate for a while" is just ridiculous.  especially in a full suit of crafted.  slate would beat the hell out of guard jendl, and yet it takes a completely decked-out paladin to beat jendl.<P>and, you don't even know who you're talking to.  i don't talk out of jealousy.  i'm only level 17.  i don't need to kill blue seafuries, or sargent slate.<P>don't talk about what you don't know.  i am making general observaions.  i'm not jealous because i can't do it.  honestly, i wouldn't want to do it either, i find it much more invigorating to be in a group, and to have fun.<P>and, i doubt that you are "more smart" than i.  if you were, you'd have known that the word is "smarter"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Sure, sometimes, maybe once every hour or three, you score a good one, and get oos and ahhs from party members, but the vast majority of criticals are less than the standard damage done in regular combat. And why is it that 70% of the criticals I do are from kick?? at least score hits from a properly damaging weapon instead of a suplementary attack.<P>And finally - I have seen a warrior - level 50 - take out a HG solo, unbuffed.
