</FONT><HR>Let me start this post by thanking Absor for even addresing this issue of balancing, there has been many great changes, the exp penalty and the changes on the test server have all been in the right direction in my mind. <P>But still id like to point something out.  I have read both hybrid and warriors discusions and here is what i found.  Warriors are not complaining about anything substancial, in fact it seems the warrior class is very well of, pre and post lvl 50.  Hybrids on the other hand have the most complains about the end game or 50+ lvls.  This is very intresting since, the only difference between pre 50 and post 50 lvls is, post 50 warrior skills are still improving since warriors have the highest skill caps, while hybrids are not, so warriors get more offence defence parry dodge riposet double atack and weapon skills while hybrids are not.  On the other hand hyrbids continue getting spells which are "should" make up for the loss of their melee skills, but obviosly from all these posts its clear that the hybrid spells are not accomplishing that task very well.<P>Ok now lets take a look at something, b4 lvl 50 warriors and hybrid classes BOTH have pretty much equal skills, take a lvl 35 warrior and a lvl 35 sk and u see that they both have the same offence defence weapon skills dodge parry ripost and double atack.  Now u would think that a sk would be more powerfull at this point right? but if he was why is no one ever mention being underrated?  Seems at the lower lvls warriors haveing to compete with hybrids who have the same skill lvls as them are still doing very well, despite the fact that warriors dont have spells.  <P>How is this possible one might ask?  Well warriors have a some very usefull skills that are only availeble to them, as well as the luxuary of wearing the best armor and weapons. Also warriors have a lot more  as well as better disciplines and more hps and a exp bonus.<P>So the question that comes to my mind is: WHY IS IT THAT HYBRIDS SKILLS ARE CAPPED SO MUCH LOWER? I mean if warriors can hold their own at lower lvls when hybrids have the same skill lvl as them why cant that continue in the higher lvls? Wouldnt a sk with same offence double atack and weapon skills be doing as much damage as a warrior? ofcourse not, warriors get crps/crits tripple atack kick and better weapons, whould a sk with same defence dodge parry and ripost be as good of a tank? Hell no, warriors get best ac armor in the game and have the highest hps by far.<P>So there it is the best solution to a problem is usally the simplest one, why redo evryones spells and add new skill when we can just give hyrbids equal caps to warriors and be done with it, and once and for all close this chapter on hybrid balance?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I view balance as a compromise between the ability to solo and ones desirability to a group.  Pets are still somewhat undesireable to a group.  Post 50 they are better but not to the point of them being a desired item.  Fear is seldom used while grouping.  The lifetaps are useful only when there are MOBs to tap that are not capable of doing more damage to you than you are able to tap from them (need more snow bunnies and fire beetles).  I think our power is comparable to other hybrids and melee when viewed from the ablility to solo a MOB.  Perhaps we are even stronger than some in PVP.<P>Were we lack is desirablity to a group.  Most of our benifical spells are self only.  At the level we get them, our offensive spells are mostly to taunt.  Groups react very poorly when the Shadow Knight fears something.  Not to say that fear is not a powerfull spell, just that is applications in a group are limited.<P>Harmtouch (pause for dramatic effect).  When I was level 1, harmtouch rocked.  It left that moss snake with a sliver of health.  At higher levels, it takes off only a sliver of health.  If harmtouch had the dramatic effect on a MOB's health that it does at lower levels, a recycle time of 72 minutes is approprate.  Every 72 minutes a lvl 50 SK adds 601 points of damage to the group total.  Were we to reduce that cycle time and scale the damage back so that it would cycle with kick/backstab/etc., damage an SK would add would be less than 3 points of damage per harmtouch.  I understand that a group is in constant combat so many of the potential kicks etc. go unused, and many miss.  Assuming the group is in combat 50% of the time and the kicks/etc. hit for an average of 50%, a kick that could hit for 12 is more benificial to a group than harmtouch.  As harmtouch will no longer quickly finish a MOB, nore even make sure I am on top of the hate list, the effect of saving up 72 minutes of 12 damage kicks into one single smack is not much more usefull than the 12 damage kick.  Would I trade harm touch for a normal damage kick?  Without hesitation!  I would lose the ability to destroy a single MOB of lawn trash caliber for the benifit of providing more output to my group.<P>I am not saying that I want to outdamage a rouge.  I want to have more apeal in a group setting.  <BR>(1) Raise the cap for piercing to that of 1HS and allow a weak backstab whose cycle prevents harm touch.<BR>(2) Trade kick for harm touch.<BR>(3) Allow me to give my mana to casters.<BR>(4) Provide a group benifical spell that I can use up my mana with.  Resist cold is usefull, but certianly not something you would seek out a SK for.<P>None of the above suggestions would make us any better at soloing than we are now.  Soloing is what a Shadow Knight does only when they cannot find a group.  The SK is not an efficent solo class, they were meant to be in a group.  The changes to the experiance table was probably the best change yet to allow a Shadow Knight back into a group.  If the changes on test go live, it will be another step toward getting the SK back into a group.  Have we reached balance?  We are getting there but still have a bit to go.<P>When I want to solo, I play my Necromancer.  When I want to group, I play my Enchanter.  When I want to fish, I play my Shadow Knight.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Yeouch.  Well, I read five of the six pages, and I didn't notice this posted, and I figured I might as well post it myself...<P>Shieldskin.  I just hit 39 tonight, and though I had prepared to be insulted by shieldskin, it still hurt.  A 55 pt damage absorbing shield, -AND- it requires a component?  I've been pretty satisfied with most of my spells, and I've found decent use for most of them so far... but I can't imagine why I would want to waste the time, mana, and cat's eye agate, on a damage absorbing shield that can't even absorb one hit from what I fight.  Most of these suckers are hitting me for about 80 at this point, and a 55 pt shield doesn't seem like near enough to be worth the cast.  Perhaps a tiny (like 5 pt damage shield) or even a casters minor shielding would have been a more useful replacement which I might actually cast...<P>Just my two cents, otherwise I love the class more than any I've ever played in my past two years of EQ.<P>Tervyn<BR>39th Shadowknight of Lanys T'vyl<BR>&lt;Chosen Counsel&gt;<BR>&lt;img src="http://members.prestige.net/tervyn/tervynsig.jpg"&gt;<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I just thought I'd post a good thing about this class. Tonight while camping Tolapmuj in Trak's lair, our warriors were not able to taunt the Juggernaughts well enough to keep them from ping poinging all over the place(Since juggernauts do not taunt well at ALL). However with the use of the spells we have, I was able to keep them focused on myself instead of having to chase them all over the place. Now, I wasn't able to tank nearly as well as the warriors could have, but I sure did out-taunt them, I'm also sure they enjoyed not having to chase the juggernauts around the lair, hehe. Our spells, esp. the darkness line, are great taunts even if they get resisted.<P>A couple things I'd like to see are increased bash skills, increased bash damage, and maybe a block skill that's only useable when a shield is equiped.<P>I also kind of like the idea of a skeletal form, perhaps reverse of what the necros have. Instead of taking our hps and give us mana, maybe have it take our mana and give us hps at a very poor transfer rate. Maybe 16 mana for 8 hps or something, or even 20 mana for 8 hps. Also perhaps a slight ac buff, or atk buff. Just sounds kind of neat to me.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>As for our offensive skills, I personally don't see a problem with them, if my spells wouldn't be resisted over half the time. I also personally believe the level 52+ pets are actually very decent, was so excited when I saw one quading for over 30 damage.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> It's not much, but it does add to our offensive ability a tad.<P>Defensive wise, I love the proposed change on the test server to bring our defense skill into line with the warriors. The only thing else I could think of needing for the defensive side is a raised parry, dodge, and riposte cap. Maybe not as high as warriors, but a little higher. I'm not sure if these skills have even broke over 200 for me at level 53...<P>Oh, one more thing. A defensive discipline would be handy, from what I heard leachcurse isn't nearly as handy as I thought it would be when I first heard about it. Now that I think about it, even bards have a discipline thats better defensive wise, as do rangers who are suppose to be the offensive hybrids.<P>Ah well, just my 2cp, I'll stop rambling now.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>At level 56, my troll warrior fully buffed with level 60 cleric/shaman spells, including Aegolism and Focus, wearing a combination of Berserkers, Cobalt and Indicolite has about 4250 hp with 1114 AC.<P>A same level same race shadowknight in similar quality equipment (umbral/POG/BE) has just over 4150 hp and 1068 AC.<P>If the changes on test go through, he will have nearly identical AC, in addition to nearly identical hit point AND a slew of useful spells.  While my armor is overall better than his, he's wielding a noctivigant blade with a 25 AC shield, which makes up for a lot of the difference.<P>The only thing I will have that he doesn't is the level 55 Defensive discipline.  If we were both still level 54-, there would be no reason to want a warrior.  Same tanking ability, but he can snare runners and heal himself and I can't.<P>Right now, hybrids and warriors are FAR too close in tanking ability.  After the patch, warriors will be outdated for anything other than high level ubermobs, and only until they completely destroy us with an inevitable nerf to Defensive.<P>If you want to improve the shadowknight, give them more spells and better spells, but increase the warrior hit points to a meaningful difference and leave us our defense bonus.  Comparing same level, same RACE warriors and shadowknights reveals that hybrids are already overlapping our specialty, in addition to having spells and solo ability.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am doubtful that your comparing similar equipment here ... however lets give you the benefit of the doubt.  I noticed you were comparing a fully buffed character... How bout comparing a non buffed character and lets see how that stacks up.  Even if we Shadow Knights get a Defensive upgrade you will still have several offensive capabilities and skills not to mention Duel Weild which significantly places you higher on the melee list for damage output.  Dont get me started on all those spells you get with your armor and weapons.  Doesnt that make you a HYBRID ... or a melee player that casts spells. Rangers have by far more similar skills and abilities as a Warrior why arent you bugging them.<P>Consider that all the spells you get on your armor and items were spells you never had before. While us Hybrids have 95% of our spells on armor exactly the same ones we have with longer casting times applied.  I will accept our current skill level and abilities only if they take away Melee Spells and Disciplines.  Sound fair???<P>Kaitan (Nightmare Clan)<BR>55 Shadow Knight<BR>Ayonae Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Simply put I think our class is pretty good.  I think we do wiff a bit often in melee even when with an atk of 911.  But with spells to back us up we're not so bad off.  But the one thing I think to look at is the usefulness of a shadowknight in a high lvl group.  All of our abilities can be done by others of an equal lvl better.  I think the one redeeming value in high lvl pick up groups is Feign Death.  But a monks FD is better than ours.  Now we get an improved FD at lvl 60 but how many Sks are going to see lvl 60 especially when they cant get into groups already.  My one biggest suggestion is to move the imroved FD down in lvls.  I would suggest lvl 50 because that i when FD pulling become a big part of most dungeon groups and i dont see how it would unbalance the class with respect to the other ones.  The monks ability to FD is still better than an improved FD skill but at least now we have something a little better to add to a group.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm the SK Slamz is talking about.  =)<P>As it stands now, SK's are very weak against the uppermobs.  The definsive discipline at 55 just owns, or they could opt for the riposte discipline to give them 12 seconds of melee invulnerability.  There is -no- doubt that warriors are what you want for the superbosses in the game.<P>But for almost all except the few guilds like Afterlife and FoH(and other lesser known ub3rguilds) and maybe even them, I dunno,  only about 20% of the game is spent toppling stuff like yelinak or zlandicar.  I'm part of a guild on VZ that is quite powerful, but we dont kill dragons and gods every-waking-hour.   We exp camp, we have fun events, we PvP, we farm greens for those neat little toys.  In the everyday exp groups, I'm easily considered an equal to a warrior.  I can tank only slightly less , I can drain, I can taunt better, I can snare, and a slew of other abilities.<P>What I would like to see SK's receive is bigger, better spells.  Better DoT Lifetap, Venom of Snake, Harm Shield, Subversion Line, Chill/Ignite Bones, take your pick.  The suggestions to lower the cast times for SK's is good, I'd like that.<P>What nobody wants to do except the Hybrids with personal grudges is put warriors out of work.  Upping the defence on Hybrids could possible do that.  Leave Warriors as the masters of melee.  Let them have their much higher weapon and defensive skills.  Leave the SK defence and offense alone as it is, I feel it's fine.<P>Concentrate on the spells for Hybrids.  Less 'useless' spells.  Alow us to contribute to the big raids as casters.  Maybe a whole *new* line of DoT's only available to Shadowknights that will stack with ALL other DoT's so that the 1 necro on the raid isn't overwriting all our level 20 DoT's.  <P>Smackz<BR>Revenant of Xanit K'ven<BR>Vallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Even given identical AC/HP,we're still inferior tanks to a warrior. We're superior direct crowd control,assuming we can land spells due to our taunting capacity. But our parry,riposte,dodge caps being lower means we peak faster defensively than a warrior. And likewise Defense,until the Test changes go through(if they do). <BR> <BR>We also single-wield at a greatly inferior rate of damage. And given identical gear for our level-even if that's me in planar and you in planar-you out-AC,out-HP,and out-defend/attack me in every respect.<BR> <BR>Right now,I'd be happy with the ability to do what we do best and live through it without being a rangeresque manasink.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>It seems to me that SKs get short shifted a lot by EQ.<P>How can we BE defensive? That isn't what I think of when I think of "Anti-Paladin."<P>Nor is it why I started my TSK. I'd like to have that addressed a bit.<P>We should be second only to warriors in our ability to deal out damage. We should only lag behind necros by 10 levels or so, and get most of their offensive spells.<P>We should be able to turn ourselves into a skeleton. That would rock.<P>We should be friends with the UNDEAD. I should con WARMLY to the undead, no matter how many of them I send back to Hell. I should be able to charm them as well.<P>That's my $.02.<P>Hey, why hasn't anyone from EQ posted in this thread? Are the SKs being ignored, as usual?<P>It seems to me that Verant should have Class Advocates on staff, who are familiar with the concerns and issues each class faces. That should be their primary concern. God knows they make enough money to hire such people. It really disturbed me that Absor started this thread off by saying that he had no familiarity with the SK class. That is just wrong somehow.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
