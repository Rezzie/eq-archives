Its not a question you designed such mobs around complete heal agro/donals+growth bps ... yet you take them away after MANY MANY GUILDS spend HOURS GETTING USED TO IT.<P>You are horrible people for making it so much harder (not challenging, just harder) for people who invested so much time in learning a system that you had in place.  Its awful.  I cant believe you.<P>Its like learning a way to do math for nearly 2 years, then someone saying "you cant do it that way anymore, you have to do it this way now" and not giving you a hint on a way to do it (Not nerfing mobs you had designed around these) so what do people do?

</FONT><HR>The obvious point to all this.  Nobody at Verant bothers to test ANYTHING prior to putting it into game.  GG Ester and your crew.  Maybe if you guys played around with this stuff you wouldn't have to continually adjust or remove it.  And before you even think of saying 300,000 people can find stuff you can't look at the obvious friggen nature of these items.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>what I cannot condone about this is the repeat of history.  Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it. I learned that saying in eighth grade.<BR>FACT: You guys admitted, and a good margin of the cleric community conceded, that the Donal's Breastplate of Morning was overpowered as was.  You took multiple steps to reduce the effectiveness of said item, apparently put some decent research into the exploits that players had found, and remedied the situation finally by reducing the breastplate to a 24 second cast time for complete heal, coupled with a 7:30 re-cast time.  Anytime something is changed it results in a few people being upset, regardless of how evident the necessity of those changes seem to be.<BR>This was supposed to be the answer... modify the stats such that this breastplate (Plane of Growth) would be preferable to the Donal's Breastplate of Morning, and make the effect "in line with game mechanics." In testing the new items, I'd have thought that this breastplate would have been under even more scrutiny than other items being that the one major nerf to Kunark armor was in the Cleric Breastplate.  Velious has been live now for some time. Granted, only recently have clerics obtained these items and begun to reap the benefit of its effect, but to nerf it now only says to me that you need to re-think the phenomenon of effect armor before you put any more unbalancing items in game.<BR>What also puzzles me is the new velious armor.  Being a warrior I have not researched the multiple other classes armors, but here's what I gather from my own armor:<BR>Berserker Vambraces: (PoG Drop)<BR>AC24, +4STR, +5AGI, +25HP, +2SV_Cold<BR>Champion's Vambraces: (Quest)<BR>AC24, +4STR, +5AGI, +25HP, +2SV_Cold<BR>Myrmidon's Vambraces: (Quest, lil harder)<BR>AC25, +4STR, +5AGI, +25HP, +2SV_Cold<BR>Warlord's Vambraces (supposed to be THE best)<BR>AC26, +4STR, +5AGI, +25HP, +2SV_Cold<BR>Where, I ask you, is my incentive to upgrade these? PoG armor is only 2 AC less than Warlord's armor.  Months of faction fixing... months of gem hunting... Super rare drop rates on Ancient Tarnished armor in the hardest zone in the game...for 2 AC and the "look"<BR>A cleric who goes through the same ordeals and obtains a Breastplate gains what? It's got the same effect, probably a few extra AC, maybe slightly different stats. <BR>I can agree with the PoG breastplate's effect being overpowered for the time it takes to get one. I've been in PoG all of 3 times, and 2 of the three times some lucky cleric got his Breastplate.  I urge you to however, re-evaluate the reward for the quested cleric Breastplates. Is there no level of attainable power in which a player can be given an advantage for their efforts? You dangle rewards in front of players, dare them to finish the sometimes beyond epic requirements to obtain the reward, then simply recant the mantra of game balance, and take it away from them.  Case in point was the sword that dropped in plane of sky from an "unkillable" mob. You dared players to kill that mob. You pushed them toward it... you had a 150/15 sword on that mob just to spite players.  Well, a group of determined adventurers took it upon themselves to prove you wrong, Slew the very quest-giver for the firey avenger, and obtained this joke of a sword.  <BR>Again I ask you, why create that which you will not allow players to obtain? <BR>Gnerb Thundyrwolf,<BR>53rd Champion of the Grail Brotherhood<BR>E'ci Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Please at least PLAY the game you run, dont try a simulation with a test server MAKE a character and PLAY it for over a year spending your time and MONEY and see how these new changes effect your playing and how much 'fun' you are making it.<P>Clerics adapt to change -SOE (sony online entertainment) nerfs again...  well either you guys will get your head OUT of your *** or players are going to leave... id like to see a raid on any plane without 1 cleric, see how many people are game for that...i sure wouldnt...<P>Ergomas Shaman of the Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I can't believe that this item didn't come up when the discussion took place at Verant to nerf the other breastplate.  What all of a sudden it clicked in that there was another?  Or perhaps it did get discussed. I'd actually be quite amazed if it didn't come up and also get discussed at the same time.<P>So instead of just getting the nerfing of cleric items over all at once, you have to go and string them out once a week or so. Prolonging the agony and frustration of the entire customer base. Sadistic almost comes to mind. <P>Does this mean by next weekend we can expect yet another cleric casting item to be nerfed in the continued prolonging agony? Just tell us how long these will go on so we can at least be prepared.<P>If you are going to nerf, just get the job done and get it over with. We're tired of the changes. Hit us with the blow, and then let's move this game on and get over the bleeding.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>No offence Absor but a one min casting time makes the PoG BP (and others like it) relatively useless even for down time healing.  The mana expendature from casting the spell can be recouped from normal medding with out clarity or bard song in that period of time.<P>It my personal oppinion that when you divise the new BPs that will drop, you should at the very least give those with PoG BPs (and others like it) the option of switching it for the new BP.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Guys, you are missing a point.<P>It's Celestial Heal, remember ? 1500 hp heal over 24 seconds ? The spell itself takes 7 seconds to even get started on the target, and the full 1500 hp doesn't land until 28 seconds after the caster starts (4 second casting time)<P>So, with this new Breastplate nerf, it's 1 minute and 24 seconds to get 1500 hp. Call it 20 hp/second<P>Healing, our 14th level heal is 100 hp in 3 seconds cast, so that makes it 33 hp / second. Hmm, so the breastplate is worse then our 14th level healing spell.<P>OK, lets' look at Light Healing, our 5th level heal is 35 hp in 2 seconds, so that makes it 17 1/2 hp / second.<P>So that makes this breastplate, which is a rare drops from some of the hardest mobs in the Plane of Growth all but equal to a *LEVEL 5 HEALING SPELL*<P>--<P>Multiplayer games in Beta at the moment :<BR>Dark Ages of Camelot (It's like Everquest, but without Verant! - Trust me on this)<BR>Shadowbane (Closed beta, open beta in a month or so)<BR>Anarchy Online<P>And about 10 more coming up the pipe in the next few months.<P>Verant, you are complete idiots.

</FONT><HR>Draconian conduct and policy works quite well in a monopoly, but the landscape is changing.  It will be quite interesting to watch how things turn out.  Especially when another company proves it is possible to see an item is "unbalancing" before putting it into play for several months.<P>Anarchy Online will be out soon, and there are many more to follow.  As other posters have said, this conduct will be remembered by many for years to come.  It will be in an even harsher light when another company treats us as the consumers we are.

</FONT><HR>Just stating the obvious:<P>What they're doing here guys is trying to extend the life of EQ.  CH and CE bp's basically take away the need for mana which is basically time on your butt's which they want you to have.<P>Unfortunately with limited mana vs. the uber mobs they have around now it means you need more people.  Sad part is you really cant have more people because you run into a ton of linkdead/lag issues, deal with lack of participation from friends, etc etc.  That leads to failures and multiple attempts which leads to time on your butt's and a longer life for EQ.<P>Hopefully someday a bigger priority will be fun and not profit.  Im sure that will happen when the mass exodus from EQ to a newer/bigger/better game starts.<P>Clerics are already too scarce, Im sure this wont help.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Why do warriors get useful procs on thier armor (Invis and Levi) while most classes get junk they already have and dont use? Then take away what good procs we get and make them useless.<BR>Dont you realize that thier are uber servers and then normal ones. Even with kunark being out for 9 months, Prexus just barely killed Gorneirre in dl for the first time in late Febuary. Even without the nerfs you have given the game if the sake of fairness, we are still months if not a year behind  FoH and others. You cant make the game fair to us and challenging them unless you just make changes on certain servers. We, not of the uber servers, will continually be left farther and farther behind.

</FONT><HR>Im still trying to figure out why you guys keep nerfing everything.  All you are doing is driving more players away from your game and costing yourself more money.  You may think that if you make mobs impossible that people will play longer because they want to kill those mobs some day, but that is not the case.  As of right now, the most well equiped, well organized, well balanced raid CAN NOT kill mobs like Sleepers Warders/Dozorek the Cursed/etc etc.  If you bring anymore than 40 people, so many go LD because your gimp servers cant handle jack, that the raid is doomed to fail.  You have effectively elliminated the only two high end raid zones in Kunark.  Sleepers and ToV had so much potential, but you killed them. <P>thanks<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>That's just it.  Just like that essay predicted.  Verant cares more about the game than they do the players now.  It doesn't matter if players have fun or not, it is about preserving their ideals of how the game should work ideally and not how it should work to be fun.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well thank you. One of my dearest friends and arguably the best cleric on my server quit tonight.  I'm so furious at you people right now.  Couldn't you wait for the corpse to die before you threw it in with the lions?  <P>Unbelievable.<P>And before you go through the "try it out" routine, SAVE IT.  It's not the nature of the nerf, its the nerf itself.  What a slap in the face, I feel for every cleric in EQ and their friends/guilds who have to watch them go through this.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Dont explain this change to anyone more than you already have. People will assume you did it as part of a vast corporate consipiracy to keep them in game longer and to just throw your power around no matter what you say. So dont say anything, just DO IT. It is for the BEST, you know the big picture, and have my best interests in mind, so I trust you. I actually enjoyed the way you just stated it, "another bp change..". HERE IT IS PEOPLE, now go play. Mom and dad DO know best 99% of the time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063795-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063795.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063795-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063795-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063795-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063795-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/063795-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=063795&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=063795&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
