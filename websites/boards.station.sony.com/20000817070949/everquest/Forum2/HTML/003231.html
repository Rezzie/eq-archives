&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Based on the patch message, I am guessing you made the decision not to make any changes to the existing twigs and branches in the game. Can you confirm this? (I say this because I would not expect you to fix an item, by adding classes to it, if you intended to nerf it).<P>If this is the case, I wish to commend you on this decision. I think it was the right one. The reason I think so, is these items have an inherant anti-twink factor. I would go so far as to say these items are the sorts of things that should be found on Trakanon and Veshans Peak. Without needed a NO DROP flag, they are only good for people over level 50 or so, AND they get better relative to other items the higher level the user.<P>Yes, they dropped off level 20-30 mobs, and that is bad. However, it is level 55s and 60s who are using these items. So some people got lucky. This is no different than those who got some great items in the first weeks of kunark. Because it is very high level players using these items, it does not throw the game out of wack, like it would if a bunch of level 30 players were using items better than what level 60s had.<P>I would like to see Verrant item designers take a lesson from this, and make some moss covered like weapons found in very high level zones. It's probably too late for FA (which if upgraded, will still undoubtably remain 2HS), but some of the other class uber weapons could be made with very low delays. I believe this should be done (although it is best for classes wanting to tank, ie paladins, warriors, shadowknights, because of the great taunt). So, make the SK ubersword 3/10 or the like, with FA like stats. Or the warrior uber-sword 4/11 with stats. These low delay weapons are perfect as high level items, _because_ they are no good for low level players. I think this is a very desirable factor for uber items.<P>-Iustus<BR>56 Knight (with twig)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I've said it once, and I'll say it again- even if VI doesn't agree with me, making things not drop any longer and then not removing them completely is the wrong way to go. It doesn't matter if their are 4 on the server or 400000, unbalanced is unbalanced. And my opinion is that these weapons were more of a mistake on the part of the item designer than anything else.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I would like to know too.  I traded away a twig a long time ago.  Had a chance to get one yesterday for my warrior but hesitated because of the nerf threat.<P>By my count it has been 4 weeks and 3 patches since Abashi said they were thinking of nerfing them.  I think it is unfair to make people who have them to wait that long not knowing if their best weapon will be nerfed...   Decide already and post what the decision is!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>"I've answered this question on the boards about 5 times in the past two weeks."<P>Abashi, I always check Everlore to get a quick summary of your responses to this board and there's one thing Ive noticed about your posting style. You are very condescending to other players and your posts really come off like many of us on this board are idiots. The quote above gives you the presumed attitude of being upset at having to answer such a stupid question over and over. You have to realize that WE don't work for Verant. We play this game for fun, and the majority of us don't have time to read over every single post that is made to this board every day, which woud probably take at least an hour of hour time.  It's a given that people are going to ask the same question multipe times for lack of seeing your answers, and instead of sounding so upset at having to answer a question multiple times, just ignore the question and let the players answer it for you. I'd rather not see a post from you about it at all than to see you getting upset that someone didn't know of one of your responses to a board that gets several thousand posts.  Let's not forget that if the items were not flawed to begin with, players wouldn't have to ask all these questions.  Had the designer not incorrectly put down the ratio for the weapon, you wouldn't have had to answer this question 5 times in the past week.  <P>This isn't a flame, I just don't like feeling stupid because I don't make EQ my life and have the knowledge about it of someone who does.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Condescension and at times open hostility has  been part of Abashi's style since about 4 weeks after he started. Im my opinion, it is one reason why the boards spun out of control to such an extreme in my opinion.<P>Abashi- you might consider taking a Dale Carnegie course.  There are several less confrontational ways you could have said this.<P>In this case, less would have been more.<BR>You could have said..<P><BR>This is still an open issue.

Have since the beginning.  Whether you intend it or not, in many posts you sound angry, condescending, or openly hostile to players who may be posting for the first time.  Just because YOU have answered a question 7 times doesn't mean that a happy customer dropping by for the first time has seen it.<P>Perhaps you could set up a file of canned responses and then answering repetatively would be a simple case of cutting and pasting the answer.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I think it would be nice to get someone new to answer these questions.  It is easy to get burned out answering the same questions daily.  Serious issues like melee binding aren't even considered anymore.  Maybe customer service rep should be a job that is rotated between everyone who works on EQ.<P>Sad to say the fate of the Frontier Mountain weapons may be a nerf.  Abashi finally tryed out a warrior to get some 'insight' into our class.<BR>What does he do?  He went and beat on a monk  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><BR>After all the talk of Player vs. Environment he checks out melee characters by dueling with them.<P>Here is a quote:<P>One of the weapons combos I tested, with both the monk and the warrior actually was the moss-twig/jade mace combo. That twig has some serious problems.<BR>-Gordon<P>All I can say is Abashi, if you are serious about checking balance do this.   Go out to skyfire where your necro breathren are soloing (no class envy). <P> Take the lvl 60 warrior you tested with cobalt armor and twig/mace combo and shoot an arrow at a mature wurm, hit a.  <P> After running from FV to loot your corpse stop by Burning Woods and repeat with a Forest Giant Ancient.  I killed one of these with my 51 druid using just my sleeves a few days back  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Took 45 minutes but it was kinda fun.<P>I know some classes, including monks and warriors were not meant to solo, but it is upsetting to be utterly Destroyed by mobs other classes can solo easily.  <P>Please try a few warrior vs. mob tests before nerfing my favorite weapon.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=003231&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=003231&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
