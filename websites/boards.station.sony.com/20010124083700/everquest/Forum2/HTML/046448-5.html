</FONT><HR>I'm getting rather annoyed here.<P>Listen to you people... Verant Interactive is NOT Absor's companay.. he does not run it.. What Absor is saying is exactly what he said.. its in the next patch!  Quite disrespecting him for things he has no controll over.<P>Why will they not do an emergency patch? Good question.. could be that they're in a catch 22 situation right now.. You want to know what happens if they do an emergency patch? They get yelled at, flamed, and set ultimatums about unannounced patches.<P>A good amount of the people who have posted so far are doing nothing but whining, demanding and making Ultimatums.  You need to grow up, IMO.<P>Am I being a Brown-noser, VAK? No.. what do I have to gain from that? :P<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>"If next patch is in 10 or more days, bard class is no more playable exept in donjons for this period.<BR>Without having instrument bonus for selo, i'm just able to run at SoW speed. As I'm actually hunting in DL/FM, most mobs are druids (drachnids) or shamans (Sarnaks).<BR>This means that I'm no more able to overrun them (and have my group overun them also).<BR>Bard's "way of play" is based on our speed ... loosing it means loosing the class power, like a necro without pet or an ench without mez."<P>So snare them.  It overwrites SoW, then Selos away.  You still have Selos.. they did not take it away.  It is simply bugged for the time being.  This isn't Reducing a Warrior's taunt to 1, maybe a 2/3rds of his normal level limit. Oh you poor babies can't run faster than SoW now. Yeesh.<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>"Some people have noted that snare and root drop with a DD, well this did happen a few times, however not every time, sometimes only snare would drop and other times only root It looks like the %chance for a DD to break root has been passed on to snare."<BR>Eep.. thats no good... I hope this was not intentional.<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>"I just LOVE patch days. They're like playing Russan Roulette with a tazer. It won't kill you, but about one in 6 times, you're in for a nasty shock."<BR>Nice anology  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>"2. Whoever is to blame about the drums being broken, just fix it NOW, or I urge every bard death to go to petition."<BR>Its fixed.. their just waiting for a GOOD time to patch.  I'd be upset as hell if they patched it now.<P>(Especially without fixing snare.. I pray this wasn't intentional)<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>"I'm sorry bards have been disadvantaged, but to bring all the servers down again and deprive the other 90% plus of the playerbase of play for x hours because you all insist on only playing one character or class is hardly a rational response."<BR>Some logic you should all listen to.<P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>"Would this be a good time to mention that when they first nerfed Selo's Consonant Chains, it was an accident they were going to fix real soon also?"<BR>It IS fixed, come next patch, its already IN the patch.  The situation is different.<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>"Please take the time to support this and all positive threads like it regarding the bard drum bug. We will be heard!"<BR>This is NOT a positive thread.  A positive thread would be a thread documenting GOOD unannounced changes.<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>"Verant claims there is no reason to fix this right away. WRONG... FIX IT NOW. Why should bards suffer due to your laziness and incompitance"<BR>Say it with me people.. Its in the next patch.   You should go work for Verant, or any other Game company.. see just how hard this crap is.. Lazy and incompitance is not what they are.<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>"While I understand that us bards are a small eprcent of the popualtion, I feel that the selos bug does indeed warrant a emergency patch. If Spirit of the Wolf or Spirit of the cheetah were bugged by the latest patch - due to the number of people affected I believe this would warrant a emer patch. The bug changes a good majority of the bards tactics and gameplay."<BR>No.. I feel they'd have the same priority.  And there is a big difference from Reducing Selo's to around SoW speed than there is in causing SoW to not work. <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>"Now we return you to your regularly scheduled nerf session...<BR>Druids, Shaman and Rangers will now have SOW working at 25% efficiency.<BR>Clerics will nolonger be able to rez, losing a weeks worth of work in 10 seconds is part of the vision.<BR>Shadowknights HT will now check vs the creatures strongest resistance and all damage will be halfed have a nice day.<BR>Paladins LOH ability will now only be as good as a button pushed Superior Healing.<BR>Monks/Necro/SK FD will now nolonger wipe them from the hate list. Mobs will run over FDed monks like there is no tommorow and pass their hate list throughout the zone."<BR>Hope that was Sarcasm.  In all consideration, you treat this like it was on purpose and permanant.  Its not.<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>"Please fix this, it is a very big deal, and it seems that you were warned by the players on test and chose to ignore them. "<BR>Do not mistake the people responsible for the bugs being fixed with the people who were informed about the bugs.  Verant is not one single body but a collection of individuals who all have the potential to make mistakes, that includes not passing along the proper information to those who need it.<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>"Without the song, many a bard is not capable of soloing and will passed over for groups by someone who can cast SoW until this is fixed "<BR>Untrue.  I haven't used a Bard's Selo's for over 15 levels now.. Even with a bard in the group.  Bards being defined by 2 or so songs is just wrong.  They have much more use than just Mana and speed.<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>"To fix this might mean a late evening. What gets me is that they did not work out the fix before the change. They could have held off on selo's breaking root for one more patch if that is all that they needed to figure out total fix. but OH no we have to fix that darn breaking of root RIGHT NOW that has been in the game for 2years, NO WAY that could wait for 1 more patch."<BR>Its already fixed and ready for next patch.  (I'm repeating myself aren't I?)<BR>It was reported, but that does not mean they were Aware of it.<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Hmmm.. I guess one thing I want to say is, Please look into the snare thing.  If Snare has now become like Root in reguards to duration and breaking.. I'd rather have it the way it was, with root overwriting snare.  Snare was supposed to be reliable when it came to duration.. Making it randomly break just made the situation worse.  If what people say is true, I doubt I an solo at this point, because I have to toss around 20 DD spells over the course of a snare and if what is rumored is true, it'll break the snare unexpectedly.  Also, I was joyous to know pet root would not overwrite snare, I hear this is not the case, Please look into this.

</FONT><HR>Hi Everyone...<BR>I just sent an email to Absor.  I was honest.  I told him he does a great job dealing with us.  Also told him i love some of the recent changes!  FullScreen invty rocks, color coded and distance dependant tracking is **AWESOME**.  <P>I also said that snare breaking is a bad, bad bad thing.  We did 30 tests on E'ci last night, druid only, ranger only, and a druid/cleric combo.<BR>my personal findings, root never broke snare, snare never broke root ... and dd or dots didnt break snare ever in any way.  When root broke normally, snare was still on.  When DD broke root, snare didnt break.<P>However, we had Namuto and Faesomething (I have her name in my log) try, a 57 and 52 druid.  Snare and root broke during dd EACH AND EVERY TIME except 1.  They used different combos of snare/root and differnt levels of DD .. no difference, root broke/snare broke ..  Gindaan, a level 48 druid, 50% of the time root broke, snare broke with it.  Kyladina, a level 52 druid (51?) said she had no problems .. however, when Aynie, a level 45 cleric rooted, the snare broke.<P>I do so hope that Absor, et al, put a fix in for this.  Forget what it does to solo kiting, because it pretty much ruins it (though, i dont know if snare breaks alone now with DD, or only when stacked with root) ... but it makes group play horrible.  I'm mainly a snarer and backup healer with my groups, with a warrior rogue and then blaster.  Crowd control goes to me, snaring main mob from wandering and snare/rooting the 2nd (used to be root and run).  If DD will break snare, or snare breaks when root does. you're gonna negate me, pure and simple.<P>And i sort of sense an "Unintentional Fix" answer coming .. the way Absor mentioned that is how it works on PvP.  <P>Ya know what would make us happy.  And not just the druids, the bards too.  Crank out the fix for this, and patch it immediately.  You have NO idea what that would do for the customer satisfaction level.  You'll make the bard community rejoice and SING your praises, and you'll make the druids plant trees in your honor, cause for once, you fixed something that we depend on.<P>Just my 2pp<P>Rexron Toebiter (Deliverance)<BR>Druid in the 41st Season of Karana's Cleansing Rain<BR>Anyone have a spare SoW?<BR>Rexron checks his back pocket.

</FONT><HR>Just when everything was starting to come together, something like this happens.  Mistakes do happen, and that is cool and all, but to say that it will be fixed in the "next" path is unacceptable.  You have crippled the traveling abilities of a class that is supposed to be able to travel.  Part of being a bard is having this ability, i personally help my friends often with traveling due to me not having to recast a spell, and it allows for alittle RPG.<P>For a company that prides itself in customer relations, you guys dropped the ball BAD on this one.  and then to just half butt it and say that it will be fixed in the next patch is a sign of poor business and a sign of a lack of desire to do the right thing to fix an unacceptable mistake.<P>I could deal with a mistake, but not the laziness or lack of caring to fix something that a class relies on immediately.<P>Good job verant, you have instilled in us all the sense of urgency and desire to fix a mistake immediately,  that you wanted to us to feel(To bad sarcasim does not work on the web)<P>Just my 2 cents, i know no-one in verant or anything will give a rats about this, but i wanted to say it.<P>A company that was worried about their business and one of their biggest revenue gainers would have pulled the servers down and fixed the mistake, then apologised for the servers being down while we fixed it, instead of offering some bull excuse of, "we messed up, we have it fixed ALREADY, but we are gunna stick it to ya with it till the next patch." i mean insult to injury here, you tell us you HAVE it fixed, but ya know, we consider it minor, and we are gunna do nothing about it.

</FONT><HR>You could break ANY OTHER SONG, Verant, and it would not have such a profound effect on bards as this one being broken. <BR>You could break HEAL song and it wouldn't hurt us as bad as this. <BR>Why? <BR>It defines us. Read the boards, many bards have died in the last day due to Selo's being broken. We can't do our thing right. Hill Giants (ANY giants) ,Cat type mobs, any fast mobs, can outrun us now. And now we are easily rootable too ( THINK: Kunark Arachnids, which run at speed of sow and root). <BR>Why does Selo's matter so much?

</FONT><HR>Ruarc: Okay, let me see, we are whiners all the time because EVERY DANG PATCH as screwed at least one of our songs up, every one. Your experience last night was good, hooray for you, but if you guys had had to run to get out of there, you'd of all been dead, THAT is our issue. This song IS the mainstay of our class, it's our one way out of a trouble spot before we die... Hell, every bard by level 6 learns that if you hit 2 bubbles of life, to get your scrawny butt firing up Selo's and haul it to the zone. I've used Selo's more than once to keep a group of enemies after me, and off my group until they could safely take them. Every bard learns these tactics, or doesn't live long, and once these tactics are taken away, we are DEAD. The bard you grouped with was probably one of the luckiest bards in existence, with reality tweaking factors on the order of Mihoshi (watch Tenchi Muyo, watch Mihoshi get out of strange situations through pure luck) in order to have NOT had to try one of those tactics. *sigh*<BR>Okay, I'm tired, I'm bored, and I, for one, am not going to play my bard till this is fixed.

Yes, it's your method of escaping danger.. <P>Bards are a jack-of-all-trades class.  You get the benefit of essentially the best of all classes (dual-wielding meleer, mana replenishment, charm, root, travel speed, etc) but you never master any of them, per se.  <P>What do you use this song for?  Primarily for cross-land travel at great speed and to evade danger.  <P>As a meleer, you should understand that if you don't bite off more than you can chew, then you should be fine.. you should have 5 others helping you.  <P>While it's great to feel as though you're the foundation on which your group is perilously perched, you have to look beyond the fact that you're not the only member in your group..  What about the druid or wizard that succor you away to safety?  What about the hp block you call a warrior? Stand him up while you get away and come back to res him later. That's what s/he does best.<P>Don't get me wrong.. I feel for you.. it's terrible oversight but it's not the end of the world for you.  Can you still dual-wield/hack/slash ? Yes.  Can you still group with others that can cover your inadequecies you're suffering from at the moment? Yes.  Will VI get this fix in to resolve this?  Yes.  <P>If VI didn't care about what we wanted, why did they do a patch of primarily player-complained about problems?<P>Hope to see your fast-feets on the road to success SOON!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am very disappointed, not just in Verant's reaction to the drum bug, but in the reaction of many of the posters here.  Not a big deal, you say.  It's just one song, you say.  Yes, it's just one song, but it's a defining song, a vital song.  I'd have to call Selo's the single most important pre-clarity song bards get.<P>It's the only song I have that is memmed all the time.  To put it in a perspective that other casters might understand, it's our gate spell.  Looking over my logs, I'd say that I play Selo's more than all my other songs... combined.  It's not just used for faster travel, it's our escape spell.  And before we get snare songs (in the 20's), it's our only escape.<P>Even in the original world, there are a lot of critters that can catch up to a bard playing Selo's without a drum.  In Kunark, there are a lot more.  I don't know about Velious, but I'm going to assume there are still more there.  Removing the drums effect may just effect one song, but as I believe I've pointed out, it's the single most important song bards have before they get clarity.  It may be more important even then.<P>If this doesn't deserve an emergency patch to fix, I don't know what does.  This is exactly the same as a wizard or druid losing their evac spell due to a screw up.  This is worse than a warrior losing critical hits due to a screw up.  And what makes it worse is that it seems quite clear that Verant was told about the bug on Test!  For crying out loud, what do the testers have to do, code the fix for you as well?<P>And finally, I'd think that as often as they have accidentally messed up bard songs when the introduced spell changes, that they would take a long, hard look at bards every time they made a spell change.  Yes, Verant programmers and testers are only human.  Yes, they make mistakes.  No, it is not acceptable when they make the same bloody mistake repeatedly.  That's not making a mistake anymore, that's being willfully ignorant.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

It is a required part of most solo techniques, as well as being the closest thing to a class defining ability for what is a jack of all trades class.

</FONT><HR>Ruarc, in the high end game I think you may be right about the relative importance of Selo's to a group.  However, at the low end game, Selo's can be very important to the group, especially if one does not have a Druid or a Shaman in the group.  When I make a comment about an ability, I usually think of the under 30 game, if only because that's where most of the server population plays.  And in that sort of environment, Selo's is definitely a major benefit to a group.  Even with SOW available, Selo's with a drum will allow the group as a whole to move to a hunting ground quickly.<P>Mind you, I wouldn't want to count on Selo's as an escape spell if I wasn't a bard   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Group benefits are beside the point, however.  Let's talk soloing.  I LIKE to solo, much more than I like grouping.  This particular change kicks my preferred playing style right in the tender spot, if you get my meaning.  Let's talk just travelling.  In my younger days, I'd often get jumped while travelling, say, in West Commons by that bloody DE necro there... Only having Selo's with a drum allowed me to get out of casting range fast enough to survive.<P>This is a fairly serious change to a class, well on par with a change to ranger dual wielding, or druid teleporting.  I'm sorry that you disagree, but I really think an emergency patch may be warranted.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You know, I agree to a point... there are times that I would like to be able to SOLO... But I choose not to because that is not really what this game was meant for... there are so many pluses to grouping.  Meeting people, possible friends... talking, and providing for the group.. <P>To not be able to do this for ONE WEEK out of your life is my biggest reason for saying, "screw you all.." and calling you whiners... if someone weer to come on here and say something like this.<P>"man, you guys accidentally screwed up Selo's. and we even said something on the test server when we caught it... do you think you could fix that ASAP, it really henders my soloin' and travelling, but I can live with grouping for now...might be fun to change it up a bit"<P>I would stop and look at someone saying that and go... hmm, he has a good point, how the hell did we miss this...  we better get that in on the next patch...<P>But for the last day or so it has been NOTHING, and I MEAN NOTHING but blatant disregard, and slamming of the people who bring us this game... calling them idiots, and pricks and a$$holes for screwing this, and hurting me, and waaa waaa waaa... I would look at that and go... oh well, next patch will have to do...because I don't have to listen to this crap... and I would get on the defensive...<P>That is why I say... they knoe about the problem...<BR>ABSOR himself has regarded it, and does not see it as a CLASS threatening problem, when in the basic of the matter it is not... so you have to get a SOW, i'm sorry, I do it every day...  So you have to group.. I am sorry 90% of the people on every server do it every day...  it is a threat to movemeny, and a threat to soloing... period.<P>you get a group for a week, and in a week it is fixed... and all the soloing bards who had to ask for sow are happy...  this is what I am trying to point out... you guys bring so much more to a group then just speed... it isnt even funny...  and to threaten a company, and to quit your account.. they are just sitting there shaking their heads at the posts, because it is NOT productive... whining never is<P><BR>Ruarc<BR>52nd Paladin (retired)<BR>37th Cleric<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I understand that what has happened here is simply a coding screwup, with no malign intentions on VI's part.  Just a goof.  What DOES dissappoint me however, is the apparent lack of interest in correcting it.  "Next Patch" indicates to us that it could be as far off as this recent one was to the previous (2 or 3 weeks?), and that's a long time to wait to have a major class issue fixed.  Providing a high-speed getaway is a major part of what makes Bards useful to a party and having it reduced to nearly nothing is comparable to accidentally dropping a cleric's ability to heal, a druid's ability to sow or a necromancer's ability to summon pets.<P>Just because this only affects a limited set of characters doesn't mean that it affects the rest of us any less.  The fact that this seems to be a historical problem (repeated errors with bard songs that go uncorrected for long periods) gives the customer-base the impression that you are not quick to correct your mistakes and that customer-care is not a high priority.  JUST because it seems to be an isolated problem right now doesn't mean that you can sit around and put it off.  It means that you can quickly focus on the issue and fix it.<P><BR>-Anth (who may or may not be starting to worry that after next patch all his armor will accidentally become unwearable to high elves and will not be offered an emergency solution)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Actually, Ruarc, I get to meet and talk with a lot of folks even when soloing.  Massive multiplayer does not equal grouping, in my view.  I still interact with the virtual world, and have other people effect my gaming experience, even when soloing.  That's one of my biggest beefs with Verant's progrouping attitude, but that's a dead horse, I'm not going to get into that more here.<P>As for whining, I think I've posted in total maybe 5 to 10 times since I started playing.  I started 1 month after retail release, so I don't think that I, at least, can be called a whiner.  I consider this situation to be serious enough that it warrants a very rare response from me.  To be honest, I don't like posting.  I hate it, in fact.  This is contrary to my nature, but again, this is a very serious issue for bards, and I play a bard as a primary nowadays.  I take it VERY seriously.<P>I do agree, some people are going a little overboard, but I can understand that.  It seems that every spell system change causes problems for bards, almost as if Verant forgets that we use spells differently than any other class in the game.  It's that difference between spells and songs that I think causes half of our problem.  For example, when they made levitate spells not overwrite themselves (to fix a "bug" on a levitate item), regular casters were not adversely affected much.  They cast lev, and forget about it for a while.  Bards, however, don't cast duration spells, we have to refresh the song every pulse.  Ergo, bards plummeting from the skies everywhere you looked (exaggerating there a bit, you know what I mean  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> )<P>It's not even the situation with the drums that has me angered, it's the lack of testing with bards.  As many times as they've unintetionally changed bard songs, you'd think they'd take a close look at them.  Add that to the fact that bards on test reported this bug BEFORE it went live, and you really have to wonder what the heck some people at Verant are thinking.<P>Finally, yes, Absor said that he didn't see this as a class threatening issue.  I believe that Absor has also said he doesn't know or understand the bard class all that much.  I think I'll take my own experiences of playing a bard for the last year over what Absor says, thank you very much.  (Not a slam at Absor, I just think the man is wrong)<P>Again, I think we're going to have to agree to disagree here. /shrug</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I wouldn't be so quick to condemn Ruarc.<P>You are NOT a bard and this problem has little to no impact on YOU specifically.  I daresay that the fur would fly if a different issue came to the fore that affected YOUR class.<P>All that aside...one of the things that YOU must take into consideration is that you are talking to BARDS.  You have admitted that you yourself are NOT a bard.  Who better to know the scope and impact of an issue on a bard than a bard?<P>I don't really care that this is a bug.  I don't care that it went in with this patch.  What I do care about is that they knew about the bug, put it in anyways, then LUMPED the entire bard community into the 'You are not important enough for us to even consider not putting this in when we knew about the issue OR worthy of correcting this immediately'.<P>Selo's, while not a class defining song for the bard, is HUGELY important in their repertoire.  It's the bard's GATE or Spirit of Cheetah or Lay on Hands or Divine Aura.  Aside from soloing and kiting...it is OUR get out of jail card that all other classes have some form of.  (you may debate this and say that warriors or rogues do not, but I have seen warriors survive massive trains simply because of their AC and HPs..and rogues simply step into the shaodws to avoid that same train)...<P>And if you wish to break it down..I see you play a cleric.  Well I too have played a cleric to lvl 52...IF..Verant had patched and said to YOU...Divine Aura/Barrier has been unintentionally changed..You still do not take any kind of damage from PHYSICAL attacks, but spells will still land...sorry about this...but we'll have a fix in the next patch.  <P>This would be totally unacceptable.  If you were any type of cleric this would be unacceptable to you as well.  It doesn't affect your MAIN role as a healer...it doesn't impact on you casting buffs or Rez, but it has major repurcussions in that 1% of situations where this can make or break your groups Raid or situation.  I don't need Divine Aura/barrier alot, always kept both memmed....but when the need is THERE...man do I really NEED it.  The idea of sitting to camp while in Fear on a bad pull and everyone is pulling stuff off the cleric while Divine Aura is flashing....I PRAY the scareling, glare lord etc etc doesn't hit me in the 10 seconds between the length of DA and the time it takes me to hit the login screen....<P>You are right..we can grab a group..we can play alts...whatever...but that's not really the point..VI has intentionally allowed a bug to go to the LIVE servers simply because they can't be bothered correcting it immediately, and are willing to withstand the bard community's outrage...cause we don't matter.<P>And that's really the issue.  How'd you like it if you were relegated to someone that doesn't matter?<P>Regards</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>  Time to add my opinion to this big thread.<P>As a 51 bard, I find myself using him simply for helping friends, doing raids, being at high level guild events, but not playing just for fun.<P>  Last night, I logged him on for fun.  I decided to run over to help someone in permafrost, then head back to solb for a dragon raid I got invited to about 10 minutes after logging on.  Cool!<P>  So I start running to perma, from EC.  Yeah.<P>  Now lets think.  Once, I was joining a guild raid in mistmoore.  A slow-to-zone druid pickedme up in WC, and took me to STeamfont.  He was already bound at Mistmoore.  He ports into SF, I take off, he hasn't even zoned in yet when I hit Lfay.  Anyhow, I beat the guy to mistmoore.  You know why?  Selo's is MY teleport.  Selo's song of travel is MY safety net when travelling places, and SELOs IS THE REASON I HAVE A BARD AT HIGH LEVELS!  I don't LIKE the mana song, I don't LIKE my melee ability, one is boring and the other worthless.  What I Liked was my ability to TRAVEL, to EXPLORE, to get away as long as I was outside.  This is intensely important to me.<P>  But, it isnt fixed.  So I wasted about 30 minutes extra running from EC to Perma, then another 10 minutes or so too long (maybe more) getting to NK where I had to pay for a teleport to make it to LS on time for a nag raid....and I also bought a sow.  Travelling outdoors, yep I bought a SOW! A FRICKIN SOW.<P>  Trilian Soulwind<BR>Yes this DOES need to be fixed<BR>51 bard, Quellious server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ruarc, if you think that Selo's is just part of solo'ing, then you truly know nothing about bards.  Also, he is right, we have 1 other Selo's song, and guess what, it is drummed based and broken too.  I am 56 and still run same speed as a level 60 sow with 235 singing and 235 percussion, but this added 2+ hours to our Plane of Growth raid.<P>We had a wipe out and CR in the plane is not an easy task.  Before the patch, I would grab one of my extra sets of drums and run around with agro and dispell ready to keep myself alive.  Well, last night, they couldn't just rez, they had to rez and camp multiple times as I was killed multiple times because I could barely get distance on the mobs while naked that if a root finally stuck, I was dead and would have to prepare to run in again.  Also, we use me for fast CRs as I can locate and drag corpses with speed of the wind to help move things along.  This has truly caused an exp hit on me, as I already die a lot pulling off tricky CRs for raids and guildmates and friends and this has crippled my ability to do such a thing.<P>My guild was sad that this bug has crippled their bards to the extent that a defenseless mage can almost pull off same stuff on a CR, with approximately same amount of near naked corpses lying around.  If this does not warrant an emergency patch, then I do not expect to ever see an emergency patch if they ever accidentally make it so druids never have enough mana to evac/gate, or wizards have only the mana to cast 1 nuke or warriors being able to tank about as sufficiently as an enchanter.  This is really sad that they have such a poor view on bards and their abilities as to let something like this hang until "next patch", whenever that is.<P>Dolphin Oceansinger<BR>56 Bard of Domus Divinae<BR>Prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok Mr seem to know it alls. Lets just have Verant do this for each class in a random order for subsequent patches.<P>1. Necros are unable to summon pets and cast 1/2 of their dots.<BR>2. Mages cannot summon any pets<BR>3. Enchanters have no mez or clarity<BR>4. Shamans lose all their buffs<BR>5. Clerics cannot heal<BR>6. Any 1hs weapon will work at 1/5th effectiveness<BR>7. Druids are root/snare lasts 1/5th the normal duration<P>Now I know I haven't given examples for every class, but you know what would happen if a class had bugs such as that? They would most likely patch it, and you guys would be complaining, so don't tell me that we don't have a right to have it fixed hastely just because, as one person put it, "we choose to play bards and bards only"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You are correct, I do not play a Bard, and yes I do play a cleric... if you want the honest truth I have used Divine Barrier in 2 occasions in 37 levels.  I guess to get right down to the point, I understand the frustration... and I am not arguing it.  If I, a cleric, were to loose something like "Superior Heal", or "Complete Heal"... I would come unglued... but here is the difference and the point I am trying to get to.<P>Tact.  There is a way to be constructive, and to get a point across and to be "gentle" about it... even in the midst of frustration, I have yet to see this.  The fact that this has been posted 6-7 times on the same subject EVEN AFTER Absor has said, 'we are aware of this issue, it WILL be fixed and put in at the next patch'.  I see the points I have read EVERY thread on this issue and I agree to an extent..  <P>I am simply saying that there are alternatives to hold you over until it IS fixed... and NO, I do not feel that bards are "second rate citizens", I think they are up in the top for their raid capabilities and incredible group capability...  but I think to bit*( and moan about not being able to go 30x's faster then the average SOW is not a compelling argument... every other class except for 4 (druid/shaman/bard/ranger) have to beg or buy to go as quick, or do a camp for 3 days to get the ring... if it is available to get jboots..<P>group for a bit, and it will be fixed...  that is all I am saying.
