So I see they are still up to their old tricks. Well I only have one thing to say to the two of them. <BR>Sell you game, sell your character, cause everyone that I know of will continue to petition and /report your filthy, inconsiderate, not having a friend in the game, cant group with another character, Low esteem, moron ass's.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I was camping the Oracle with Houngan the other nigh - went afk when he spawned, Dalover poped in stold the kill - and when Houn asked him why - he simply said "report me" and then sat down right there and logged out.  Well I have written a letter to Verant, but from everything I have heard from other players on the servers, this guy and his sidekick have been doing this to alot of people.  Many have reported it and there never seems to be any action taken against him.  So he feels he is justified in what he does.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

He must have nothing to do then to piss people off and the thing that really erks me is that he is so blatent about it, he doesnt care if you report him and to be honest, I dont think that Varent will do a thing about it. makes you wonder....<P>If you havent been KS'ed or Ninja looted by him, you WILL eventually.<P>He is making the game unenjoyable to play and dont be afraid to /report Dalover aka Shyness at the drop of a hat. and mabey, just mabey he will be brought to justice.<P>to Dalover,<BR>Your names will never be trusted by anyone on this server and you will never be able to sell your account via eBay.

</FONT><HR>Annabelle (his partner in crime) is pretty bad as well. Just look at it this way. Dalover will NEVER go to a plane. Dalover will NEVER kill a Dragon. He's a level 50 in a guild where the next highest is like 20, all the big guilds know him and hate him. You'll start heading to guk and get high level items...and he'll keep ksing level 35 mobs for mid level items. You'll got to fear and get your Carmine robe...and he'll still be in his Oracle robe. And if that alone doesn't make you happy, twink a monk out and train his lame ass. thx FD!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I am not to fond of either of the two. They continue to kill steal off everyone I know. It's amazing how we continue to petition and /report them and nothing ever seems to be inforced. Maybe now that we have Lady D on our server she will possibly look into this matter. If only we had her email address. I am almost positive she would take action. Lady D is one of the only GM's in this game who holds her self to strick guidlines on role playing and dose not tolerate this kind of action.I proclaim that any single person or group of people email Verant directly. It would be nice to see somone like this get banned, we do not need people such as them interfearing with our gameplay. I understand how long some of us have camped spawns waiting for the all high booty loot and to have them come and take it away from you. This can not happen no longer. Verant or Lady D if you happen to read these message boards please look into this problem for the sake of this role playing game and its characters.

He kills dwarfs and let newbies loot it for free. Some of ya can't even donate a copper to us newbies like those posting on this bourd.  Ya know why he is still around?  Cause he hasn't done anything bad.  I'm sure some of ya is just whining cuase ya some little 10 year old, (like the person who posted this topic).  Geez, its only a dum game.  Consider this.  For example, fires of heaven.  They KS everything in lower guk.  One night i was playing,a fires of heaven necro (Xerexs)&lt;--- name.  came and charm the frenzied and killed it.  Then charm my&lt;-- yes it was my cavalier and killed it.  Xerexs is not even banned yet.  This is even more worst then dalover.  I have no hard feelings.  its only a game.  One time dalover was in oasis giving out free items, bladed thulian claw, dragoons dirk, lockjaw vest, fs weapons, and last but not least he gave out a mammoth cloak. &lt;---- damn baby.  I bet some of you guys dont even know who he is, but from hearing from some of ya friends to petition and report him, ya just do it.  Ya is feeling guilty doing this, and how would ya feel if this happen to ya.  Last but not least, I have to say the person who posted this topic SUCKS.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>You really must be joking.  If anyone has ever spoken to Dalover, a million to nothing that was posted by him.<P>I've played this game coming up on a year now, and not a single person in this game has left a worse taste in my mouth than you Dalover.  You are hands down the crummiest person I have encountered on this game.<P>You have a reputation that you have built on mistreating others, and it has become very well known.  Many players, not just a few, have been a victim of your take as you please style of playing, and it really is sad you would imply that everyone is wrong because they are 10 years old.

</FONT><HR>I LIKE DALOVER!! I dont know what you guys are talking about but this guy helps me big time.  I was in cazic thule this one time and had to solo the AOF cause my group all died and I was the last one, then he came in as I was dying, "HELP" I said, and he started nuking the thing.  By that time the AOF was down to 60% on energy and I was at two bubbles left and still tanking.  Man I tell you if he wasnt there, I would be a dead man for sure.  Then after he helped me kill it, he looted it and gave me the RAVENSCALE BP!!!  I bow to him and thanked him heartily then he left and said Glad to help anytime bro!     So I dont know what you people are saying.  I have seen even more bad people like Dynamic Ninja looting the SMR in lower guk, and just as the recent post says, he is a Fires of Heaven.  I plan to join his guild shortly. WE definately need more people like him.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Is Dalover by any chance related to Baty?  haha  Just spread teh word that he's scum and he will find it harder and harder to get groups.  He will never get in groups that go to plains.  Thats what players like shyness later learn.  They are jerks to everyone and think its great cause they get crested helms and oracle robes and then they realize at level 50 those items bite and they will never get the best items in the game.

</FONT><HR>Dalover is the most opprobrious, disrespectful, and feckless waste of a human being I have ever met in game.  His partner Annabelle pales in comparison, although she is fond of training people on purpose.  Keep in mind folks, that anyone can register a new account and post here, so most likely he has registered twice to throw approbation his way.  I have never seen two people illicit quite as much of a response when they enter a zone, nor have I seen players in a zone unite against two people so steadfastly.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I kept it on hot key (my hot key only said dragon so that's all I rem hehe) but the guild is either very small and now defunct or they all go anon bc of him. Anyway the pro Dalover poster said they saw him do all that charity stuff - Yeah What were you following him around seeing dalover do many acts of kindness? If you know that much about him you are him or a close friend. nice try tho. Dalover is not a nice person and I don't see how he is still on the game. if his account ever goes on ebay could you imagine the poor sap who  buys it and get insta hate thrown at him? hope he only buys it to gate around with.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I was always under the impression this was a fairly good guild so I guess that's changed.  Anyway I put a shout out asking how Dalover actually got in a guild.  Someone in the guild asked if that was bad that he was in their guild.  A few shouts came out that he's a jerk and what not and Dalover sends me this...<P>"Your harrassment and what you say in zone has been reported to Lady Dagarmo!  I've talked to her about this issue, and she told me to send all evidence!  Say things at your own risk!"<P>Let me get this straight idiot.  People have been petitioning you for ages now, myself included at one point or another, and you think that the GM's are making a special case for you because your such a nice guy?  ROFL!!!  Nothing has ever come out of a petition on you because your still here.  Say things at my own risk?  Reputations are based on actions, you chose your own path.

He's moved quicky up the ladder to being an enemy of my guild, and we wish to see him banned.  Hopefully one day he will be.<P>I've had a few conversations with him.  He's weird that way.  If he is KS'ing you, he will not respond to a single tell, but if you wait until you see him again he will talk to you.  Only thing is, he will bull**** you a lot.  He will tell you that he only has a bad reputation because he is a high level wizard, and people just 'expect' him to KS, and garbage of the like.  I don't know whats more frustrating, the fact that he is the biggest KS'r on the server, or the fact that he likes to pretend as though he has no idea what you are talking about.<P>Dalover, report all you want, you will get yours soon enough.
