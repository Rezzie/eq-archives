</FONT><HR>Brell is a long way from being split. Check Bertox. It was split and many times still has more players than Brell. I agree with the responses concerning Kunark. I spent a lot of time in Timorous Deep. At times I was the only player there. The most people I ever saw at one time was 20 or 22.<P>The newbie zones like EC have gotten really bad. People are bickering, fighting over camps, and kill stealing each other constantly. Let's say you have been playing the game for a long time and decide to develop a new character. You'll find it nearly impossible to find a competent group.<P>I had a level 1 warrior character for the purpose of holding the extra bagage. When Verant said they were going to delete unplayed level 1's I decided to advance this character so I wouldn't lose the stuff. Well I took a vacation from my regular character and kept playing the warrior and he's now level 13 with a mixture of banded and bronze armor, two Langseaxes, Shiny Brass Shield, and a 2H Dwarven Ax. These people are amazed at what I can do. I kill evens and yellows easily. I start fights with blues when I'm three bubbles down. Sure I know it's easy now but won't be later on. It's not easy for my level 30 paladin. A tough blue might kill the pally unless he LoH's. Anyway I've only grouped twice with the warrior. The first group was useless but the second one was a little better. At least two other players were helping me, another healed while the rest stood around gaining from the experience and the loot. I never took any of the loot. It grew late and I said that I had to log. There were no bye's, thank you's, nada. The most I heard during the session was something like, "Wow! He can fight!".<P>The fact is, my warrior is an average fighter but looks really good compaired to the latest generation of uninformed newbies. Obviously many of them don't research their characters. My warrior had the advantage of having some excess bagage, some of it armor. He had the advantage of starting out with banded and bronze which is not that big of twink compared to what a lot of players are doing. He had no coinage at all to start with.<P>Many newbies leave their kills unlooted. It isn't much but it's a start. A thousand coppers equals a platinum. In a second newbie zone it doesn't take all that long to get a thousand cp if one works at it. The new player does have to run to the bank a lot. He/she is also collecting silver which adds up to gold quite quickly. The black bears have rare drops of high quality bear skin that's worth 20 to 25pp. Sometimes the decaying skeletons and orc pawns are carrying weapons such as the cracked staff which are worth over a plat. Sure! Later on no one wants to deal with the copper and silver and similarly valued items, but the newbie should be looting everything! I've noticed more newbies now begging for money or items. My response to them is, "Go kill and loot!"<P>Another thing I've noticed is that newbies are leaving their proper zones much too soon. I see level 3's and 4's wandering around in EC and of course leaving countless corpses all over the zone. I've even seen low levels in Timorous Deep. They have no idea of where they are, how they got there, or how to get out. It's a big watery zone and they don't know which island they are on.<P>It's truly amazing!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Part of the problem is that some people have their own way that they want to play and refuse to adapt to changing conditions.<P>There's the "If I'm not campin' it's not happenin'" attitude.  So many people come up with this belief that they have to camp in order to hunt.  Well, if you believe that, you're in for a LOT of boredom.<P>It's the belief that someone has to find something for you to do.<P>Quit being such a baby, alright?  "I don't want to share" is more indicative of the kind of person you are than anything else in your post.  It's not about "me me me me" and "gimme gimme".  If your chosen place is too crowded for your comfort, MOVE.  don't expect everyone or verant to accomodate your laziness and/or self-centered attitude.<P>And this isn't personal.  It's directed more at the attitude you exhibit.  I really tire of people treating this like it's a single player game which has but one purpose and that's to entertain one person at a time.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hey it really doesnt matter what Kunark is like.  The advertisment on the box says 1500 players to a server when i see 2300 +  it means someone at Headquarters is sacrificing my game enjoyment for their back pockets.  Its over crowded so bad in Kelethin that its nickname is "lag city".  This is a real problem.  Enjoyment of the game is suffering.  PC Gaming magazine rated EQ 4 and one half stars; the reason it didnt get 5 is "overcrowding".  Get with is Sony and Verant.  Split this server and anyother that has more than 1500 players.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>There is no need for a split.  With so many people off in Kunark, it's not bad at all.<P>But I'll definitely second that post about uninformed newbies.  It's murder trying to get many of them to understand the concept of killing one thing at a time.  My 16th level enchantress has wasted bubbles and bubbles of mana on mes's that were instantly broke.<P>I have absolutely no problems with people not understanding and breaking a mes.  But then when I explain to them what to do, and they still continue to do it the wrong way, and when half of the group chimes in asking them to assist someone, and they still don't, and then they get mad about it...  sheesh.  It's one thing to be ignorant, it's another to remain so.<P>And you are right about certain zones.  They are crowded because people who have been playing this game for a long time have a comfort level in those zones.  They know them well, and are willing to accept the crowding to remain with that comfort factor.  That sounds like your problem.  Try and find some new hunting grounds.  Get on the web and ask what places you can hunt at your level.<P>For one place that is usually deserted, I would love sol A to be a little more crowded.  That place is a gold mine of xp and loot, with lots of special drops, but all the 25-35 crowd seem to be off in South Karana killing gnolls and Aviaks...<P>If anything, Kunark has made it a little harder to find groups in good zones, because there aren't as many people, and you can't always keep a group full...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

The advertisment on the box says 1500<BR>&gt; players to a server when i see 2300 +<P>The 1500 number was pre-Kunark.<P>You don't seem to be aware of how EQ is built. <BR>Each "server" (i e "instance of the world"), pre-<BR>Kunark, was run on 13 NT servers. Some of those <BR>servers only served a few zones with high loads; <BR>others serve many more zones which are typically <BR>not so populated.<P>When Kunark came out, they added more machines <BR>for all the new Kunark zones. Thus, people playing<BR>in Kunark do not impact your machine's load at <BR>all. Now, suppose Kithicor forest and Qeynos were <BR>sharing a physical machine. If a lot of people <BR>suddenly crowded to Kithicor, Qeynos would also <BR>get more laggy. However, as long as they spread <BR>the zones in a reasonable way across the <BR>machines, they can easily run with 2000-2500 <BR>people per "server" because the now have many <BR>more machines per "server".<P>Incidentally, I believe this is why you sometimes <BR>see messages like "These 5 zones will go down in <BR>10 minutes, and then be right up again: ....".<BR>Those zones share a machine, and that machine <BR>needs a kick in the behind for some reason.<P>Anyway, given the attitude in the original post, <BR>I wouldn't want to be grouped with that player, <BR>so no doubt he's having a hard time finding <BR>enjoyment in the game if others feel the same.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

You will have no problems finding hunting grounds with no competition.<P>Mid Teens, I traveled my little gnome cleric to Kunark and braved the journey to Kurns Tower.  I don't think I ever saw more then 10 people in this zone!  FoB is great too!  I get a backpack full of food and off I run.<P>20's: Try Lake of Ill Owmen and War Woods, Najena, MistMoore, UpperGuk.  Ill Owmen I have seen this zone with 50+ people and I didn't see a single peep where I was camping for very long periods of time.  Groups are pretty easy to come by here also or start your own.<P>30's: Frontier Mtns, Overthere and Dalnir, SOL A, (I made levels 40-43 and about 6k in loot in 2 weeks in SOL A killing Gnomes) Rathe Mtns, Tracks Teeth (lots of mid 30's stuff to pull, leave the 40+ mobs to the farming Druids) - Lots to camp, mobs to pull, some Mid Level Dungeons to explore, great xp and relatively safe if you have half a brain.<P>40's: Dreadlands, CoM, Overthere (still), Burning Woods:  Same thing, lots to camp, easy pulls, doesn't take a high level of skill to be successfull.<P>50+: Kunark is your only real option now (minus a few places, IE Efreeti Room in SOL B  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Karnor's, I never have a problem getting a group together here.  Granted I usually pick up 3 or 4 guildies and get a few zone lfg pickups.  I almost never camp the zone in Karnor's.  I hit the tower or move back to the second tower.  Nothing better then pissing off 3 groups at the zone by camping the Court Yard.  Skyfire, very easy pulling! I never see more then 20 people in this zone.  Get your friendly Necro or SK and Fear kite all day long!<P>Bottom line, there are MANY MANY zones you can go to that are not crowded.  You just have to get away from the general geek population that follow a certain migration pattern.  The Geek Patroll usually start in GF, EC and Crushbone, then move to Oasis and Unrest, then head to SK.  I find the same mindless banter in OOC and Shout there now that I did 11 months ago when I first started playing EQ.  Get out, travel, see the lands.  You will find good uncrowded camps, meet decent people and have more fun.<P>Redspine Bladeslinger</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>As an Iksar necro (I think I am still the highest iksar necro in the server I am lvl 52  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">), I have some hard time to find a group in Karnor. Also never be invited to join any raid like Howling stone, Seb.... I almost solo all the way from lvl 1 to 52 in Kunark. Kunark is good for newbies. but when I hit 50+, Like red say, Kunark almost the only choice. When more ppl become 50+ the zones are become crowd. Too many high lvl necro on the server, necros can't find a group easy. besides most group dont need necro. in my lvl, I solo the bruning wood gaint fort. It's boring, I went to other zones, like skyfire no group needs me  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"> how sad. Also I am started late, so not much friend in the server. so I quited to play my necro, and went to the newest server TP  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> to start a new char. I agree that we need a split soon. Maybe I will back with my necro when the server split. now I just play with my Cleric on TP. Cya all and happy hunting.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I hate to say it, but Lisset did not even slightly understand what I originally posted. He is way off the track.<P>"Part of the problem is that some people have their own way that they want to play and refuse to adapt to changing conditions."<P>1) Everyone has to adapt to the changing conditions. That statement is irrelevant to the subject matter.<P>"There's the "If I'm not campin' it's not happenin'" attitude. So many people come up with this belief that they have to camp in order to hunt. Well, if you believe that, you're in for a LOT of boredom."<P>2) I never said a word about camping, but if Lisset is not willing to ever camp anything, he will never get the good stuff.<P>"It's the belief that someone has to find something for you to do."<P>3) Again totally irrelevant.<P>"Quit being such a baby, alright? "I don't want to share" is more indicative of the kind of person you are than anything else in your post. It's not about "me me me me" and "gimme gimme". If your chosen place is too crowded for your comfort, MOVE. don't expect everyone or verant to accomodate your laziness and/or self-centered attitude."<P>4) Lisset completely derailed the train on this paragraph. He didn't understand a word I said. Doing all the work IS NOT LAZINESS! Letting others take all the loot IS SHARING! I don't expect anything out anybody except for them to pull their weight if they are going to group with me. I have a feeling that I hit a nerve in Mr. Lisset and that he is much like the people that I find annoying.<P>"And this isn't personal. It's directed more at the attitude you exhibit. I really tire of people treating this like it's a single player game which has but one purpose and that's to entertain one person at a time."<P>5) I don't take it personal, but what I really tire of is annoying clonish people and that's what the ignore list is for.<P>But back to the original subject... The server is NOT going to be split for a long time. Trust me!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>/agree Redspine<BR>There is definitely a I want to level fast and disregard other players aura to some zones : Oasis, SK, EC, Gfay, Crushbone.  Last Januaty, I would hunt in Oasis with about 30 people, now I take my druid there, and at peak times there are 90.  I ended up porting him to toxullia and camped Neclin Shaah a necro that's lvl 18 in Paineel.  I made so much exp and saw practically no one in the zone.  To all the newbies, just go to a place less crowded, it might seem like weaker mobs, but you'll make more exp because you won't be fighting over spawns, or KSing.<BR>Banuram Battlerain</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum40&number=40&thisthread=000009&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum40&number=40&thisthread=000009&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
