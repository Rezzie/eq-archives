</FONT><HR>Ok, since the SK discussion was closed, I start a new topic. I do not believe SK's should get Dual weild, Why? because together with DoT's and HT we would be near unstoppable with the Uber wepons people are putting on their twinks now a days. The improvement I think SK's should get deals with SPELLS. "Either upgrade the useless spells in the Lifetap series or make some new ones, My lord at lvl 25 it would take your entire mana pool let alone 30 minutes to suck enough life out of a MoB to fill on bub of hp's i.e. these spell are so inefficient they are totally useless. Pets could use improvement also, the reason I say this is because I see VERY VERY few of my SK brethren even bothering to summon a pet ESPECIALLY in a dungeon. Summoning a pet in a dungeon = instant greernie train. Dual Wield? No. Kick.. maybe just an extra attack so the small races of SK's will be more appealing. I do have to say man to man I could take any warrior on my server of comparable level in a duel.... I will post more later<P>Cynder Stormreaver<BR>30th Shadow Knight of Innoruuk<BR>Prexus<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok there we go with the dual weild again if SK's get dual weild, Who is going to play a warrior when an SK has most of the skills ( not taking into account disciplines ) I agree it would be GREAT to get dual weild but I think it would make the SK to powerful cranking out that much damage that fast since Darkforge adds alot of stamina we would not get as fatigued as warrios. So anyways I think the best thing they can do for SK's is as follows   1) Add the kick skill. 2) upgrade the lifetap spells so they are an efficient heal such as are necrmancers, leave all the other spells as they are. 3) If anyone is sayin anything about Harm Touch, if you want to make it a special advantage make it so powerful that it is pretty much INSTADEATH to anything it is used upon, Why? because all in all character balance melee type classes are at the bottom of the barrel they are very inferior to pure caster type characters in all around gameplay, they cannot bind themselves (long runs) they cannot heal ( die alot in unbalanced group) Which is not as uncommon as you might think. ( they are severely hindered when it comes to traveling. ( Keep in mind I am talking about ALL melee classes ) What do I propose? Up the damage output of ALL melee classes if you want better melle, not just SK's because casters Ccrank out way more damage then melee classes and also have the ability to heal, gate, teleport, buff etc. In my experience CASTER type classes outweigh melee classes in number than melee classes by 5 to 1 on prexus. So.. where is the balance issue? between casters and melee not hybrids and pure melee classes.<P>Cynder Stormreaver<BR>30th Shadow Knight of Innoruuk<BR>Prexus<P>reply with any further commentary I am anxious for more opinions.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't think SKs should get dual weild either, but double attack and ONLY double attack, with no combat disciplines whatsoever, doesn't do jack against uber mobs, or any 50+ mob for that matter. <P>My suggestion? Triple Attack post 50 or maybe 45+, and a combat discipline or two.<P>It won't make the sk the supreme tank by any means, not even close, but it will give us some means of dmg out put when we're faced with uber mobs and uber MR.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If Shadow Knights are going to be changed I think it should be in skill or spell aspect, I totally disagree with adding items like procing shields and such to balance a class, Why you ask? because items in the game are hard to come by for people who haven't the time to play EQ 8-12 ours a day if so I would have full Darkforge by now and if you don't camp an item you have to buy it and thats a whole other story since money is REALLY hard to come by and people would sell a Shield of Ykesha or whatever for up in the thousands of pp making it unavailable to casual or newbie players so adding items will NOT balance the class unless you can twink one, which as of yet I cannot do because I play EQ about 3-5 hours a day simply for the fact that thats all the time I have away from work and sleep to play. So my opinion is to add the kick skill to SK's if dual weild is added the MoSS and Noct Blade, (2 examples of weapons there a more like them ) will have to be made lore or some will have to be made unusable by SK's, giving SK's dual weild would be a huge undertaking so I think we should get kick so small races can have an extra attack with 2hs/2hb weapons. The larger races would still have the advantage of higher strength (ie More Damage per strike) and the fact that they cannot be stunned ( which being stunned while running from a dungeon train has so often ended my life ) also Trolls of course have the regen thing. So kick would be an easy addition and a tremendous help to the medium/small SK's<P>post more more more  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Cynder Stormreaver<BR>30th Shadow Knight of Innoruuk<BR>Prexus<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It will be resisted as much as your life taps are...  And at 55 even less (I haven't had it resisted at all since the chance).  It was changed in the latest big patch.  Try it out.

</FONT><HR>Another point on the duel wield (which I'm against) is that I like the shield, and in alot if instances I NEED the shield.  Extra AC from the shield almost makes up for the Warrior's higher AC Armor.  I'm an AC is King kind of guy so duel wield isn't an option for me.  <P>I like the increased Bash skill, increased damage from bash and increasing at least one weapon skil to equal Warriors.  Also I think Critical hits would be nice at the same rate Warriors get it just give it to us later.  Warriors have had that skill since level 12 or so, giving it to us at level 40 doesn't seem unreasonable.<P>Those who want archery skills increased, WHY??? do you actually still carry a bow in your range slot after about level 15.  We get spells to pull with, put a AC/Resist/+Stat thing in your range slot and get over it.  Archery is for Rangers and the classes without magic to Pull with, 'not a true combat skill'.<P>Higher Defence and Offense skills I think are agreed upon as a good thing by all (SK's at least).  I think we could realistically get 1 of the 4 major weapons skills raised to equal a Warriors without upsetting anyone else.  I'd like to see them all raised, but if we had 1hs or 1hb raised with an REAL improvement to Bash and the ability to score critical hits post 40 we would be on the right track.<P>Not overpowering for melee improvements but it would balance us there alot better than we are now.  Then fix Vamperic Embrace and I'd be happy.<P>Neptunis Rex<BR>LVL 39 DE SK</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, you don't really need a MoSS at level 35.  I use a Sap of Piety and do doubles for 40 all the time.  Fot 1hs I have a Gleaming Short Sword, I only get hits in the 30's with it but it is fast.  I use 1hs/1hb more often than not, my 2hs stays at max, but I'm fighting in dungeons now which means CASTERS, which means you want every opertunity to disrupt them.  I'd say your Mithral is nice but for the same money you could have gotten 2 very nice 1 handers or like I did, go get them yourself.  Both can be gotten at level 32.<BR>Remember, the next time you swing with that 2hs how many times you hit fo 5HPs or miss entirely.  I don't parse logs, but those that do keep reminding us that the misses and low hits account for alot and a 1hs isn't all that far behind.  And if you want true damage with a 1hs trade your Mithral for a wormslayer, its almost an even trade now and when you add that to bash and the extra AC of a shield you will end up a winner.<P>Neptunis Rex<BR>LVL 39 DE SK</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Basically, I love my ShadowKnight.  I am lvl 46 right now, and I have 1701hp and 838ac(no umbral or anything cool like that, just sentinent and darkforge and the cougar earrings.  I use a Moss(3k on veeshan), and since I am a DE i maxed out the skill going through lvl 45 from a skill lvl of 1. INT! Also, I look at a human sk and laugh, i look at a troll or ogre and think they look absolutely stupid. So glad i made a DE<P>  I think that shadowknights should possibly get a kick, but Dual Wield would be entirely out of the question.  Not only would it be unbalancing, but everyone would want me in their group.  Wouldnt be fair at all.  With the moss and 106str haha, i hit for 65 or so.  I was fighting a solusek kobold in solb with me and an equal lvl warrior hacking on it, and I got the exp.  It all depends on how much we miss, and with the moss i dont seem to be missing a bunch anymore.  I like the fact that i dont have to constanlty ask for a sta buff.  I like a shield, I bash for 12 or so.(shield is 25ac 100hp 5sta off general something in Kith.  More damage.  Think about this for a second, we have FD, we have invis(short timer =P) we have lifetaps(if u arent a troll or ogre u can actually do a ton of them)(142int myself, I know a 51sk with 182) and 3 dots that stack for about 350 damage or so.  I normally get 2 rounds of dots off per fight, so thats 700dmg.  Plus we snare, got the sorta FD pulling(no mem wipe it seems like though). How does a warrior get this? spending money on potions. vs undead ones at least.  With the exception of kick or possibly a lvl to increase in MR ratio, SKs are pretty fun.  And cmon, at 52 we get a good pet finally! I cant wait.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm a level 22 Shadow Knight. A bit twinked but these days who isn't? My only gripe at this time is the fact that I use 2hs weapons and I'm human so I don't get bash. I get my 2 attacks per round MAX. Sure I can stack DoT's and use spells like Vampiric Embrace to drain a little extra health from a mob but it still comes down to the fact that I can't bash, or Kick. I see ranger kicking and even though its not alot of damage it can sometimes turn a fight if you have a couple of guys kicking a mob. I don't think SK's should get kick and bash but I think they all should get kick, while only the larger races can bash.<BR>Just my outlook on this situation.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>In regards to giving shadowknights kick, or duel wield.  If you want more damage output play a large race. Take the disadvantage of the exp penalty and not being able to go to many cities. That is the price you pay for added damage, or regen. Which I have found sucks alot at times.  Unless you kill uber orcs and are able to "walk around in Kelethin with the Banker hating you".  <P>If you are playing a small race and are a sk then you down right arent going to do as much damage, but will probably have access to more equipment. Getting armor in a "no twink" fashion is quite difficult for us large races. I think that SK's have it pretty good right now (i am only 25) We will see.  <P>Aust, 25 SK Troll<BR>"AuSt SmAsH LItTLe TingS!!!!"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>WAKE UP PEOPLE!!!!!! I have only read half the post, and stoped cause of all the posts I have read about dual wielding MOSSes.  First off, the MOSS is a LORE ITEM, so if you are not a dumb ass newb, you's know that you cant dual a lore item.  You say a SK gets his strength from his spells, but if you are on in a group with a necro, you can through out all your spells pretty much, he got them many lvls ago.  The pet is only usefull as another target for a mob so its not beating on you as you wittle away at it with you ONE weapon, and if you take the time to cast DOTs instead os melee even if you DONT have a necro in group, AND the mob doesnt resist them since the spell is a spell for half your lvl, you end up wasting attacks that do almost as much damage as the DOT IF it sticks.  Yes SK get a very nice mace, but its still not the same damage output of a dual wielding melee class.  Dual wieling melee class?? What is that realy?  Look how the class are broken up.  They are you have 14 classes, 7 primarily caster classes( that all get bind and gate) and 7 melee classes, that all but 2 get dual wield.  If simply in the interest fo balancing out the classes, SK and Pally should get dual wield the same as a BARD(***? a bard gets dual over a SK and Pally? explain that one to me!) and every other melee class in the game.  If you want to say they are more caster class then the other melee, I have to disagree.  Bard are by far more magical in what they do then SK and Pally. Even if you still say they are to much of a caster, then why not give them Bind and Gate?  I personly think that bind and gate spells are where they belong, but dual wield is a melee classes RIGHT to have.  Do you realy think that a SK with dual wield would be more powerfull then a Necro? Do you tink that a little more damage output( and might I add that it will also mean a LOWER AC cause of the lack of shield )in melee would make the SK or Pally the next Uber class that every one will want to start playing cause its so powerfull? Get real! It will only give the SK and Pally more options on how to play thier character.  The same options that all the other melee classes have, but are not allowed to a SK or Pally; do i use this 2hander or that, do I want to use a shield for the AC, would I be better off with this weapon and that weapon or maybe this one?  Verant wants this game to be balanced among the classes but also has an almost unnumberable different weapons to chose from and use for all classes and class specific, and almost all of you better ones are LORE, like the ALMIGHTY moss.<P>To add one last thing to this post, I have one HUGE reason that I would like to see SK get dual wield.  I think it LOOKS cool.  For no toher reason then that I would love to have dual wield.  I know there are many players out there that also like to select certain items to use based upon the way they look.  After all, IMAGE IS EVERYTHING!!!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Even if we got dual wield at 60. It would almost make no difference in the end-uber game as it stands now. The most imortant thing verant could do, is increase all our skill caps. Pre-Kunark we had similar caps with warriors wich made us balanced. Why did they chose to eliminate this?<P>BTW: I in no way shape or form want dual wield. Im just demonstrating that at level 60 with dual wield, we would be far from being the gods you newbies think we would be.<P>At level 20, yes, that would be a bit too unballancing.<P>Tripple Attack at 60? now thats a more legitimate suggestion</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It's a nice Ranger ability to get them killed faster, lets leave it at that, oh and yes Bards can duel wield, but they aren't know as damage dealers so its more of a gimick for them anyway.<P>Get yourself a nice 25AC shield, use a wormslayer or better and have at it.  No you won't outdamage a Warior (and won't be that close i know) but if you feel completely useless your doing something wrong.<P>Neptunis Rex<BR>LVL 40 DE SK</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I dont see why our casting skills cap at 255 while our weapons skills cap at 200, i was under the imprestion that we were supposedly 3/4 warrior and 1/4 necro so shouldnt our casting skills cap lower than our weapons skills? I mean im sure there is some reason why they dont but that makes alotta sense to me under the circumstances.<BR>Wolfaal Fleshrender<BR>shadow knight of the 40th killing cycle<BR>Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Lord-Wolf, STOP THAT, yor trying to make sense angain and you should know that's no allowed.<P>On the plus side Channeling is great and probably more important to me than a Necro.  Now if they reduce the cost of pre-50 LifeTap series it may become useful (but I'm not holding my breath)<P>Back to the Duel Wield, STOP, I hate the look, if I wanted to duel wield I'd be a Ranger.  How about some originality and identity.  When you see someone run by with a Sword and Shield what is he.....Pali or SK.  I like that.  When someone runs by with duel wield what is he.....Bard, Ranger, Rogue, Warrior  any of the LESSER classes.  There is nothing mystical about duel wield except you get to buy 2 ubber weapons instead of 1.  <P>Lets leave some flavor in the game.  We all don't need to look just like Warriors.  And I do plenty of damage now to feel needed in my group.<P>Neptunis Rex<BR>lvl 41 DE SK</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Can someone tell me how often a normal day-to-day occurance it is that a shadowknight is attacking a level 60+ mob? And how their inability to do damage against that mob is justification for the need to dual wield?<P>-Wadin Pureheart of Quellious<BR>Ranger, 55 summers<P>PS&gt; Oh BTW, the argument that rangers would be making if shadowknights got dual wield would be to give rangers the AC and hit points of shadowknights. Hey we would still be hit harder by those level 60 mobs because our defense skill is still 40-50 points less.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000590-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum15/HTML/000590-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000590&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000590&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
