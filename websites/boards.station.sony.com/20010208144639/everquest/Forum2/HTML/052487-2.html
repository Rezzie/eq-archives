&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I'll try and keep this short...<P>Iceclad Ocean: WAYYYYYY too empty.<P>Thurgadin: A breath of fresh air - I'd like to see the npc "animation" go further and in more zones. It adds dimension to "the storyline".<P>Icewell: We have to take two groups down here, and people rapidly stop wanting to go because balancing exp can be difficult. A reasonably nice zone tho. The bear is a novel challenge  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Tower of Frozen Shadows: Whilst this was a terrific zone to explore, it seemed a bit unrewarding, although a plentiful supply of pet weapons is on hand. A bit like Najena, it felt very boss-mob focused rather than dungeony. Maybe we just didn't see the rare drops, and many of the mobs seem to be all or nothing droppers.<P>Great Divide: Not hunted here much, but it appears to have settled in to the usual "find a safe spot and camp from it". NPC pathing could use a review so that encounters of multiple mobs are rarest if you move around and make it the "hunting" zone it appears to have been intended to be.<P>Eastern Wastes: Superb zone. Ry'gorr armor seems to be fairly well placed, but the other armors, e.g. ulthork, seem to be twink material as obtaining it is generally just beyond the people who would probably most want it. Also the Ulthork stats are a little... Odd... Who would want to wear -35hp armor?<P>Kael: One tough dungeon. The "giant scalemail" armor is a bit of a mystery to me. You're lucky if merchants will pay 1pp for it. Getting the quest material is multi-group hunting stuff. Our two groups got in "comfortably deep" and were fighting lvl 55 and 56 mobs. Again, balancing exp was difficult because in a raid of 12 you only really have 6 'juggleable' slots (3 taken up in each group by cleric, chanter, evacer), and we didn't want to start telling people "you can't come you will unbalance things!" Seems to be a bit small, we got torn enchanted silk. Other than that we didn't really come back with much.<P>Captain Bvellos drops interesting stuff that has monk-like stats but is WAR only. Our monk cried when he saw the stats and the WAR only attribute =)<P>Velketor's Lair: Not hunted here, just explored. Boy o boy o boy, what a superbly designed zone. Great work. Why haven't I hunted there? All reports have been of atrocious loot and horrible resists.<P>Wakening Lands: An interesting, underused zone. Mainly underused because people have bad CoV faction. Also because of the faction-while-zoneing bug that is killing lots of people who try to get into the zone via portage. Loot? Is there any here?<P>Skyshrine: What an awesome zone! And although it is the biggest non-ocean zone in the world (people think the courtyard is deep; I have to laugh at that, they aren't even out of the basement, rotflac [lac = laughing and crying]). Unfortunately many of the quests are broken; the baker & cook quest (they give you the quest but not the items needed for it), the sentry emil quests (items aren't available), the mercenary assignments quest and giant toes quest (neither kcor or emil will respond to being given the items). Also, yelinak faction is a little *too* hard to come by given these broken quests.<P>Cobalt Scar: A nice zone, actually. Not sure what will happen when general populations finally reach there and learn more about it. I've seen no loot drop of worth or mention. The quests are a little "iffy", and it's a long haul to have rewards more random than the sentry kale ones. Only two real issues with this zone; the siren's undercon somewhat. They are rather on the tough side. Other issue; fighting bulthar's is a bit of a tight squeeze, especially with the shellfish collector that regularly wanders up and steals kills. We lost probably one in 3 kills to him, until we got a cleric to start rooting & atoning him, but even then we had problems.<P>Plane of Growth: Only explored this one. Looks very impressive. After a year of trying for Imbrued armor in hate, I'm about ready to blow tunare and go up there and hunt... Everyone is telling me great bard armor rots up there almost every hunt, and after over 305 logged (probably over 500 hours total) hours in hate and singing steel being more suited to warriors than bards...<P>Beyond? I don't think ordinary players like myself or my guild are intended to be able to pass the rather firm barrier that is Siren's Grotto. Most players seem to consider Velious the realm of the uberguild. Personally my feeling is that Siren's Grotto is the beginning of that.<P>I haven't tried to venture beyond Cobalt Scar, tho, primarily because the nearest cleric is usually nearer thurgadin, and I don't fancy paying 1kpp for a cleric to haul himself all that way for a rez...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>This is the opinion of one Albrion Hammerfell. lvl 45 necro. Spent lvls 28-45 almost EXCLUSIVELY in velious. so here goes. As a former 50+ cleric since day one of retail EQ, I have played Kunark and Norrath prime for almost 2 years, so I can judge these zones based on those. <P>Here goes...<P>********ICECLAD OCEAN*********<P>**INTENDED LVLS: Good for lvl 30-40ish<P>**RISK vs REWARD: 6 (rating 1-10)<BR>Sparse loot but decent, Cougar Claws too common now, and are saturating the market. Should likely be more rare given the tremendous amount of cougars around. As for XP, Some mobs are decent xp, while others are not, no huge variance of note though. Melees get real antsy about fighting here because the bind location is very far away and dangerous for one who cannot self invis, so caster classes are the only ones who tend to xp here with any frequency.<P>**FUN FACTOR: 4 (rating 1-10)<BR>Gets old fast, not much to do here but pull to coast and fight there. Not a lot of people choose to fight here for very long because of this. The teleport isle is a deathtrap of aggro roamers, so noone hunts around there, kind of a waste of space. Might have been different if you could have your back to a wall or a lake, but no such luck so people tend to run to the bridge as fast as you can. The "ubermob" of the zone is the turtle, and some people have already pointed out the problems with that mob. There is an awful lot of wasted water space here, and an interesting far off island might have made this zone, and the ubermob more interesting, rather than a KS fest.<BR>**OVERALL: Decent zone, nothing special.<P><BR>********TOWER OF FROZEN SHADOW*********<BR>**RISK/REWARD: 2 (rating 1-10)<BR>This is another Kaesora, a waste of a great dungeon design because of the risk/reward. Most players of appropriate lvl have come here once, or never. Mostly because they come in to see blue conning mobs at lvl 40, yet these mobs hit hard and fast well beyond their con. Even greens hit pose a risk here. The dungeon layout is great for a dungeon romp, but the risk in this place is just to great for a 6 man party of appropriate lvls. Hence, people rarely come to this zone for xp, as it is VERY HIGH risk for the lvl of the mobs, yet XP seems no better than your average dungeon. Like Kaesora, this zone usually has several lvl 50s farming the good item drops at the top lvls. Thats all. Also, this is very dangerous for a Melee to die in, as the bind point is so far, and with a dungeon with keys, the general rule of thumb is... dont die. For players who "should" be coming here at he lvl intended, this place is : Major danger, little reward.<BR>**FUN FACTOR: potential 9, but currently 2<BR>This dungeon has the potential to be a really great zone. It has a story, it has different lvls, and a real sense of achievement. The problem is, it is a keyed dungeon, and that produces prohibitive risk for the lvl that the mobs were intended for. Most people who have done this dungeon have had to fight there way through greens to get the keys, and were suffieciently overconned that to them, there was little or no risk involved. Only then, was it worth the risk reward, which was.. no risk, high reward. For appropriate lvl parties, it is High risk, low reward.<BR>**Overall: I came here first with a lvl 58 mage who was farming for key/items. The next four times I came I was 38, 39, 42, and 44. At none of those times was the risk/reward worth it. The mobs hit so hard compared to the mobs just outside that I find it hard to reccomend to my permagroup to come here. Sad really cuz its a really cool zone.<P><BR>********EASTERN WASTES*********<BR>**RISK/REWARD: 7<BR>Very good zone for XP and grouping. This zone allows full well for both grouping and solo play. The orc camp is a great gathering place for people, and it is usually easy to find a group there. People pull to bridge area when hunting regular mobs, and the Oracle was a well known solo or duo xp permacamp for lvl 55+ players. The walrusses and Uthorks are good risk/reward in both loot and xp for thier lvls, and are fun to fight, but... like everywhere else, the common method is to pull to the waterline. This gives the obvious advantage of not having wanderer adds, at the very least, from only one side. Wandering mobs are all over this place so it makes the center areas devoid of players. The southern part of this zone has no players because it had no camps or varied mobs of note. The Giant fort here has the occaisional group, but mainly giants are done for faction or soloed by necros/druids. Giants give very poor xp for the time/risk involved in killing them. It used to be at least that Giants at least gave good treasure to compensate for having double or triple the hps of a similar conning mob. But without the rewards, people tend to do giants only for faction and quest pieces. At the lvl they con here, its just much easier to find other mobs to xp on. Again, this is too bad, since Giants are very fun to kill in a group. Increasing their lvls such that they are still blue to a lvl 53 will help things a lot here. <BR>**FUN FACTOR: 7<BR>This is a fun zone overall. The mobs are nice and varied, the xp is generally good. The risk is decent but not overly so. The Loot is decent but not too great. This zone has a lot going for it, but like most others, it could have been much better if the south part was more interesting. Adding a few more smallish Orc outposts would have really juiced up this zone a lot. A helluva lot. Also... where is the Ubermob of this zone? Usually, every zone like this has a really high con rare spawn Ubermob to add spice to the zone. There is no such mob here. This zone would have been much cooler if a named large griffon spawned here to add a bit of excitement. Again, not a fault, but could have been better.<P>********CRYSTAL CAVERNS*********<BR>RISK/REWARD: 10<BR>This zone is PERFECT. The risk reward here is great. Rygor Oracle cloaks are very rare booby prizes. XP is not great per mob, but the mobs are more frequent and are not overly difficult which gives the appearance of danger, and creates a lot of excitement. The random spawns of some of the named mobs makes this zone difficult for high lvl players to roam through and Farm. Beautifully done in that respect. Not a single item here is "overpowered" for the difficulty involved in getting them, but they are great for their intended lvl. The fact that there is a hidden dwarven city down below adds so much spice to this place. Too bad Melees cannot bind in this little city. Kind of strange that they cant.<BR>**FUN:<BR>If you were fortunate enough to be of low enough lvl to experience this place for xp, you know full well that this is likely the best and funnest dungeon crawl to date designed by Verant Interactive. Whoever it was who designed and tuned this place should get a raise. Beautifully done on all counts. The ubermob (spider queen) is the only mob constantly farmed by high lvl players, but that is hard to avoid. At the very least, they made it difficult enough for those high lvl farmers so that they usually cannot do it alone.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> I would have liked to see more quests obtainable in the dwarven city there, but because of faction issues for the lvls required, most vendors and NPCs were non-responsive. <BR>**Overall: This zone puts a lot of faith into the idea that Verant can really get things right sometimes. Too bad there arent other zones like it in Velious. Velkinor's could have been like this. It could have, but its not, for many reasons. I bet the same guy who designed CCaverns designed Velkinor's but it was someone else who screwed up the tuning there.  Anyway. Congrats on such a fine piece of work. Im just glad i got to experience this zone while it was blue. This zone in itself made me very happy that I returned to Everquest after 7 months away. Cheers.<P><BR>********EASTERN WASTES*********<BR>RISK/REWARD: 8<BR>People XP here. They do it because Tizmaks are great XP and are fun. They do it because Kodiacs are great XP and fun. They do it because Wurms are AWEFUL XP but fun and (used to) drop good loot. Wurms suffer from the same problem that some Giant camps have. They take a long time to kill, and present a decent amount of risk, yet provide for Very Low group xp. Anyone in the group who is looking for XP will be sorely dissapointed. You can make 4 or 5 times as much XP on bears as you can on Wurms. Risk vs. Reward is kind of out of wack there. The Wurms also used to drop other items with much more frequency. It is common for a group to spend all day on worms and leave with nothing to show for it. That would be ok if the xp and pp was decent, but it is not. Not at all. People will still hunt them with frequency, as its the only place to get some of the dropped lower lvl spells, but it does not have to be laborious.<BR>Oh. And one more thing. The rate at which ICETOOTH CLAWS come into the world is way too high. There is no way that an 11 29 1hslash weapon should be selling for 200pp now since the market is so flooded. This is the cause of some major low lvl mudflation.<BR>The Tizmaks are good constant XP for their lvls, though it is very dissapointing that despite the world builder's effort in creating such a large and diverse cave system for them... they populated the whole caves with the same 4 or 5 tizmak mobs. It would have been much greater had they created a "benefit" to exploring within. Noone goes deep in outside of the one area with the named. Why go inside when you can just as easily pull to the outside? This is a waste, and if it were retuned to harder mobs as it gets deeper, players of higher lvl would camp and explore deeper inside. As of now, the inside caves remains a ghost town, and for obvious reasons.<BR>**FUN<BR>This zone is really kind of fun. The geography layout is interesting. There are plently of places to set up shop, and pull to as well. Loads of landmarks to keep you from getting too dissoriented. Many many caves which free the options to form new groups or join ones in progress. Very well thought out zone. Kind of surprised that there was no scary Ubermob randomly roaming around here. Remember the Griffon in West Commons? Remember the roaming Giants in East Commons? That one random Sand Giant in south part of North Ro? The Mino Hero in Steamfont? Most larger zones have a form of ubermobs to keep players in check and to raise anxiety and fun level. This one does not. If there was, lets say, an Abominable Giant, (a white colored Larger version of a Gaint) then people would have to keep a lookout for him and hence there would be a greater sense of danger and fun in every general camp. <BR>**Overall:<BR>This zone is a very well made zone that could have been a little better, but is very good nonetheless. No major issues.<BR> <P>********VELKINOR'S LAB*********<BR>RISK/REWARD: 3<BR>What a great dungeon design. As a lvl 45 necro, I only xped on the inside entrance area to this place. Everything was blue to me, but they were green to my lvl 53 SK friend. Only thing is... they might as well have been high blue, because they hit for well over 100 damage and to my surprise, had ZERO for loot and provided miniscule xp. I really tried on several occasions to get my group to come here to explore or XP, but when risk/reward was evaluated after an hour or so on several tries, the group just realized it was not worth the time or effort. Sad. Really sad. I explored much of the front area by myself, using feign and invis. Some random spiders seem to see invis, which is ok, but the problem is, the density of the mobs here makes it Train central. Also, DMF for some reason doesnt seem to work here. Kind of strange that my best buff is somehow negated in what seems like a normal zone. There are FAR too many spiders at the entrance. Less density of the mobs and higher lvl and xp would make this place a viable xp area and grind. But... the way it currently stands. NOONE is ever here unless its an uberguild raid. Seriously take a look at retuning this zone. The risk/reward for the intended lvls is NIL, so at any given time there is NOONE in the zone. Welcome to Chardok II. At least in Chardok, people get decent xp for the entrance mobs. But those mobs are lvl 50 and hit for the same damage as some of these lvl 40 mobs. A real mistake. <BR>FUN: <BR>In exploring this place as much as I could, it seems clear that this dungeon would KICK BUTT as far as dungeon romps and fun place is concerned. The layout is very interesting and there are plenty of places to pull to and explore. The only thing is... why? Why would anyone in their right mind fight hordes of underconning low xp no loot mobs? Well. The answer is... noone does.<BR>OVERALL: A broken zone. Nice layout, great design. Poorly tuned. No risk/reward unless you multigroup raid to get to the ubermobs.<P>********KAEL*********<BR>RISK/REWARD: 4<BR>Did some grinding here. A lot of people enjoy killing giants as they also give great Thurgadin faction. The problem is, they have higher hps than other similarly conned mobs so therefor they should net much more xp as the kill per minute ratio is much lower for a full group. Well. They dont. XP does seem better inside here than it was on outside giants, but over the course of 4 hours full group grind, xp was less than to be expected, and loot was very low considering the risk involved.Giants should drop spells and gems a little more often and perhaps the random rich giant drops 21pp or so. Its just unrealiztic to look 8gold pieces off a lvl 42 frost giant, no matter what the economomy tells you. And as for XP, boost it up a bit. People WILL grind here more often and have a better time if they get decent XP on these mobs. They dont though when compared to other mobs elsewhere. There is nowhere to run here, its an indoor zone with giants all over the place, so risk is higher than outdoor mobs. But XP seems the same. People will notice this over time. <BR>FUN: The simple fact is... people like long fights. They like Big adversaries. It is why we play the game. It is much more fun to kill a huge giant than it is to kill for instance a similarly lvled frog. People inherently like the battle. The challenge. The risk. The whole drama of it. But.. when its all said and done, people will learn to avoid places where risk/reward is to their disadvantage. That is the case here, though not nearly as drastic as the Wurms of Great Divide. <BR>OVERALL: A strange hybrid of dungeon and town, I have a hard time thinking what to make of this zone. Very cool dungeon design, but there seem to be a select few areas to pull to when fighting, otherwise it becomes a deathtrap. IF Everquest allowed for 12 person groups, exploring might be more of an option here, but a six man group is relegated to pulling the same old spawns to a safe spot. Strange tuning here. It makes me wonder what they had in mind for this zone in the first place.<P><BR>I havent spent as much time in Western Wastes and Skyshrine to give it a judgement, but ill say this.<P>********WESTERN WASTES*********<BR>A good zone which allows for some serious raid possibilites. Loads of dragons and many new mobs to hunt. For me, at lvl 40-45 I grinded on some Sentient Armors, Tigerraptors, Pixie thingies, Panthers, and flying apes right out of wizard of oz.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><BR>The loot was good, and the xp was also quite good. Seems like a zone I will be spending quite a bit of time in. The density of the trees in the northern areas presents a very large risk since you have to pull to the wall if you want controlled fighting. <P>********SKYSHRINE*********<BR>Severely nerfed drop rates on the armor have caused the grind rate here to slow considerably. The mobs here seem to hit hard, and xp seems very slow but given the previous drop rate of Sentient and Sentry items it was sometimes worth the risk. That seems to be no longer the case, and single group grinding has become much more difficult to accomplish at the intended lvl now. <P>.....<P>So there is a brief synopsis of my experiences so far in Velious. Overall I have to say I am extremely pleased with the expansion. I am even more surprised by the fact that there are no HUGE bugs and pathing errors. I have yet to see people exploiting pathing and quests with great frequency, and the speed at which verant developed this expansion is nothing short of remarkable.<P>PS: Plane of Growth is a joke, and is called by all the guilds PLANE OF GIMP as it seems to be designed to be farmed. This makes the whole high lvl risk/reward ratio very sad indeed, and diminishes the accomplishments of those longtime players who tried so hard to earn their Trakanon and Venril Sathir BP and Leggings. Also. The fact that there is no Break-In is really quite pathetic. This plane is Farm Central and will and has thrown the risk reward ratio into a spin.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>In the Wakenlands, the Flying Monkeys tends not to fly in the air. They rather go under the world and beat on you and your party until you zone. Wuoshi must be moved from the portal.<P>Cobalt Scar is really messed up. Not only do the mobs gate out after they are nearly dead but they don't go back to their spawn points. Even if they do guess what? Their corpse goes POOF. Secondly, the drakes there have a huge AoE radius so it doesn't make sense to try and kill them because they will aggro the otters. Lastly, if there is more han two druids there then the whole zone is camped.<P>A guildmate went to Kael Drakkel and conned warmly to both giants factions and still they killed him.<P>In the Tower of Shadows a Necromancer cannot land a single spell (including debuffs) on Tserrina which is level 51. /boggle<P>Sirens Grotto=A big joke.<P>In Skyshrine, mobs that are Enchanters can charm people who's MR is over 150.

</FONT><HR>As a high-mid level player here`s my perspective.<P>Icelclad: Good intro zone, lots of wasted space. A good 30`s zone to hunt with friends. 34 level spells should drop here (Garou is too rare for it to not be a joke)<P>Eastern Wastes: Fantastic zone. Decent loot and risk, lots of things to do and room to do it. Roamers are too plentyfull to make hunting in the middle of the zone worthwhile. 39 level spells should drop here.<P>Great Divide: Another good zone. Tizmak/Giant/wurms/coldain to hunt here depending what you want. Loot is low compared to risk but zone is well designed and plenty of spot to set up shop. 44th level spells should drop here<P>Kael/Thurgadin: Enemy or friendly city, good design, some quests which are either impossible to complete without setting up raids or worthless. Attacking one requires multi-groups of high level people. <P><BR>Rest of the zones: haven`t been, prolly won`t ever go.<P>Standard complaints: Everything is a miscon. it was ok for old world exceptional npc`s, but not for EVERY creature on the continue. just indicate them as 5 level higher than they are presently.<P>High MR/HP. Just plain nuts<P>Too much of Velious designed exclusively for the uberguild. Yes they have a right to play but so do the casual players. To get anything done in a lot of places will require raid sized groups of 18 or so. Guess what, most of us don`t have the time/inclination to put together raids on a daily basis.<P>Quests: You put more quests in, but made them incompletable by 90% of the playing population. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Okay, lets start this off, I'm a level 45 (43 when I started off) rogue on the Druzzil Ro server.<P>I've spent ALL my time in Skyshrine since Velious came up (well, after about four days, when it was found, hah) and I've seen some pretty huge creature / loot changes since I've been there.<P>-The sentries near the zone were buffed to hell, making it a pain in the ass for clerics and such to get through.<P>-The creatures called "Gargoyle Guards" have been buffed, making it just a pain in the ass, as they don't drop any loot beyond cash. <P>-The drops on Sentry armor were completely NERFED about two weeks ago<P>-The drops on EVERYTHING were NERFED about a week ago.<P>The zone is decent exp, but not really worth the effort anymore, I could goto lower guk, or Sol B and get BETTER exp, and more loot. <P>The Sentry and Guardian drops were, I admit, a bit out of hand when the zone first came up, you'd get a drop every 10ish kills, which may seem like alot, but with a good group, you can pull the whole area near the zone, and get items dropping like wildfire.<P>Then they nerfed the drops on sentry, which pissed me off, as it's the only armor I could wear.  Guardian armor dropped about at about a 50% ratio with how often it dropped before, and sentry just didn't drop. This was fine, and still could have used some re-tuning.<P>I think what really needs to be done, is this. - Make sentry and guardian have a 5% dropping off of each kill, but ALSO make it a 50/50 chance of it being either.  Having only sentry, or only guardian drop is just stupid, as it makes it no fun for all the chain classes.  Aswell, tone down the drops on the sentry / guardian robes, they drop like wildfire.<P>If you want to get ahold of me for more information, you know my email address =p<P>-Exitilus Ebrius<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ice Clad: Lodizal eeds to be made tougher. The loot he drops is way too good for how easy he is. Make Stormfeather tougher too. Seaworthy planks are broken.<P>Kael: Quest armor needs to be made more common. Chainmail quest tunics are non-existant so rangers are pretty screwed.<P>Mischief: Is it finished or isn't it? Make up your minds.<P>Growth: Ranger/Druid armor should drop there. Many mobs are rangers and druids so it makes sense. Quest items should be useable by non-tunare worshippers. My Karana worshipping ranger is double screwed in Growth. No armor drops and can't even use the nice quest helm.<P>Necropolis: Nice zone. Loot could drop more frequently. Queen's carapace should be chain class useable. <P>Western Wastes: Nice zone, but dumb that roaming dragons gate. There are a couple ways to stop it though.<P>Icewell Keep: Very bad pathing issues. The Dain will poof if you try to pull him without levitate. The Dain banishes people to the pit, then often runs right off to the pit to fight that person. If he wanted to fight that person why did he banish them away?

</FONT><HR>From what I've seen.<P>Coin loot so far has been good. I've hunted in EW, Kael, Iceclad, Great Divide, Crystal Caverns, Frozen Shadow, and have gotten some good impressions out of Icewell. Infact, to be honest, coin loot is the main reason I keep going back. Velium Weapons drop often in ALL zones, which is a good thing since they sell for FS rates at a vendor and about 10pp each to players on the mainland. I love the random rare drops off of masses of mobs - that type of stuff, tho lacking in quality, is still fun to aquire.<P>I want to say thank you for Royal Frosted Velium armor. I never have to go to PoF or PoH again. Bless your souls. (Hell, and it LOOKS better too)<P>Gotta LOVE the ease of some of the mini quests, I am a quester by nature and these are tons of fun. =) The new armor looks are grand, and sells for a pretty decent price.<P>Overall, from the zones i've been in, I think this was great.. Btw, non kos gnolls? WONDERFUL change of pace.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Other than that I haven't gone in too far.. being guildless does have it's good and bad points. One thing tho, please make the new texture files an optional patch..some of this stuff should be shown to all considering how much effort goes into getting it. =)<P><BR>~Akaran DeHawk, 49th Paladin, Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>In my opinion, SoV is not worth the time to get to for the most part. When Kunark was added, I went there, and for the most part have stayed there for almost 20 levels. I have gone on day trips to Velious, but I won't be living there like I did with Kunark. Why? First because the mobs are seriously underconned. I am a level 52 ranger, a LOOOOW green should not be pounding the snot out of me, no cracks about rangers please. The experience gaining mobs are easier than the greens it seems to me. <P>Thurgadin is what FV should have been, you can live there and almost never have to leave. You have supplies there for the tradeskills, you used to even be able to buy food there (but that's another thread  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ). Icewell keep is insanity. I went in there with several groups the other night and I must say, who was the one on drugs when they put the HP's on these mobs? These things have far too many HP's, and almost no loot. Spells and some crushed gems, for the quest armors, were all I ever saw. What is the RvR in this zone? Lots of risk, zero reward, and you can't just walk out of the zone when done. You need to be able to gate or be TP'd out. Very limiting in who you get to invite with you, you need at least one druid or wizard or no tanks will be ABLE to go with you.<P>Wuoshi is a major problem for those that want to get in further without having to go thru KD. Move him and lower his aggro range or that zone will be avoided like the plague by those that hunt dragons. They will just bypass it and head further in to SS instead, causing that zone to fill up.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Finally, some adventure to be had.  I hate everything being safe, this is an adventure game, there should be times that are dangerous.  It's sorta dangerous to solo port to here, but if you bring a group ready to fight, it's fine.  Takes a bit of tactics.<P><BR>Eastern Wastes: This is a fun zone, good fast-paced camps with lots to hunt.  Much closer to a bind point, so melees are willing to hunt here too.  Just wish there weren't any static spawns, it's the old camp and wait for Chief and Blacksmith.<P>Woushi:  See above, I love it.  Fix the zone bug and it will be perfect.  Should be a choice, if you don't want Dragon faction, don't go there... find a dragon ring that you can use.<P>The Bad:<BR>Dragon rings: Very cool, why are the spells so hard to get?  We really need a key ring, for these and all the other places with 5+ rings required.<P>The Ugly:<BR>Spell Drops:<BR>I never liked this in Kunark, I hate it here.  Warriors camp these things so they can turn around and sell them for 1 - 3kpp, can never get in the group, and they are super rare.<P>I play for fun, I never camp items I can't use, and I rarely have more than 300pp on me, which all goes towards Trade Skills for fun, or my next set of spells.  You have made these things impossible to get for all but the uber-l33t players that constantly have 10k in the bank for whatever reason, camp spawns for stuff they only plan on selling, etc.<P>I really, really, really think that all casters should always be able to get their primary spells.  Mage research is a joke (read: time/money sink, we are the only ones that ALWAYS have to buy a spell, or worse yet, do TWO difficult researches in a row).<P>Enchanter research is close to perfect, you go around, collect and combine, easy to train, etc, but I digress.<P>If I want a super-duper robe, I have to camp for it for hours (got my wife the one off the Queen), and that's fine... that's the type of thing that should require lots of camping, my basic spell line should not force me to stop having fun (Camping guardian wurms is NOT fun, static spawns suck, period, and are boring, no risk, no fun, no excitement).<P>-- Fabmatil Fabulous<BR>41 Mage, The Tribunal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Only two comments to add, and they are just repeats of what others already said.<P>Resists are too high on lot of mobs to make exp camping here worthwhile. Takes too long to have melees tank everything down and eats too much cleric mana which equates to more downtime yet.<P>PoGrowth is a candy store. Might as well just have the armor randomly spawn on the ground and then everyone can just go pick up their full suit of ubergear. The risk factor for the reward would be about the same as it is now. Having full suit of PoG armor is no mark of accomplishment and carries no justifiable satisfaction for having earned anything.<P>Vertex</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Kael Drakkel: Love it! My heart is always racing whenever I have to pass through this zone. It's very nicely set up.<P>Plane of Growth: It looks unfinished. Tunare is sitting in a plain room all by herself. No throne, no servants, no decorations. Where's the Tunarean Court? I didn't see any faeries, pixies, or fae drakes up there. Only one tiny little thifling 'village'(4 huts). No wandering Druids. Didn't see any unicorns or pegasi. Maybe put some centaurs up there too. Do something to spruce up the zone a little.<P>Crystal Caverns: Awesome zone! Good job on this one.<P>Thurgadin: I love this place. The atmosphere in the bars with the talking and clinking of glasses in the background was a very nice touch. The initiates getting trained at the Paladin's guild was very amusing stuff. The city just feels alive. I like the detail that went into this place.<P>Great Divide: Eh...you nerfed the drop rate on spells here just a little too much in my opinion. <P>Iceclad: What happened to the Garou? Did you remove him? *sarcasm* Even when he does show he never has the quest item anymore. Other than the Tower of FS this is just a so so zone. <P>Eastern Wastes: The battle between the dwarves and the giants that's triggered by a quest is VERY cool. I'd like to see more random events like this in the game that don't require a quest to trigger them but happen on their own at random times. The orc fort is cool however it has a couple bugs. First one is a pathing bug. An elite guard will walk out of the main building and stand there a bit...then walk around back going around the 'tower' that contains Chief Ry'gorr. He will walk towards the other side and end up walking into the wall and getting stuck but you can't see him...until he aggros and junps you. The other bug is that if you pull an orc past either of the side buildings it aggros the orcs inside but you can walk past visible with no problem. not really a big deal but annoying. <P>Tower of Frozen Shadow: One of the best damn dungeons in the game! I love this place. The only problem is sometimes the mobs that drop keys to the next level for level 1 & 2 will sometimes take hours to spawn. It's too bad there isn't some way to raise faction with Tserina and do a couple quests for her. My necromancer would join her side in a second.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Wakening Lands: Wuoshi is a jerk. Tar goos splitting upon killing one was a rather nasty surprise. =P<P>A thought...back when you put the unsavory individuals in Qeynos Hills you were onto something there that might help with camping. The camp started off low level. Kill a set and the next would respawn very quickly but higher level and so on. Leave it alone and eventually it would reset. Both low and high levels could share the same camp because of the quick respawn and varying levels. The quick respawn gave you something to do constantly. I'd like to see more spawns(not all, just a few) set up this way. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Velious has several problems:<P>1) After 50th level, it's extremely unfriendly to pickup groups. Unless your guild organizes raids daily there, or the guild druids and wizards just love teleporting people around all the time going to Velious is a major hassle because people generally stay in Kunark.<P>2) Mobflation - Honestly, mobflation was getting very bad in Kunark and in Velious, it's gone completely nuts. MR, HP, Damage per round, you name it. Not only does demand owning the best gear (and even more radical time commitments - but that's also a zone design thing) but it renders any class that isn't a total specialist pretty much obsolete. Furthermore, it's completely unfriendly to alternative strategies. <P>3) Risk for the sheer sake of risk - I'm completely unthrilled about putting great amounts of risk in some of the more mundane parts of the game. You're in danger porting to iceclad. You're in danger porting to great divide. You're committing suicide if you gate to WL while wuoshi is up, and trying to escort a group on the run through Kael is crazy.<P>4) &gt;&gt;I think this is the most important&lt;&lt; - Remember how when you designed the experience tables you built them so a typical group of friends could level up together? Well, a year and a half later, those same group of friends who were able to be a balanced group for much of their life will probably find themselves very unbalanced in Kunark, and completely unworkable in Velious unless they just happened to pick just the right classes. <P>5) This is very important. Many groups of friends I know don't play together now, not because they don't want to, but because the demands of zone and monster inflation are so high it renders almost every typical group of friends that used to be reasonably well balanced, now obsolete - unless they just happened to make the narrow team of specialists. What was once the "dream team" in the old days is now pretty much the minimum standard, and if you can't make the cut or squeeze your old group of friends into that "6th man sympathy position" they can't really play with you. This was already happening in Kunark, but in Velious it's taken out to the extreme.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>SoV Overall: Great concept in that it gives lots of options for big guild raids. It fails however to provide the other resource the 50+ crowd are missing, pick-up group dungeons. Am I really expected to sit in KC until 60 to have any reasonable chance of getting a pick-up group?<BR>Also you need to retune ubermobs as a priority - how shortsighted are you keeping 100% magic resistance now that you can have mobs with 2 billion hp. Think back, way back - Vox/Nag originally didn't have too bad MR but were significantly buffed once it became clear the 32k hp limit made the encounters far too easy if casters were invloved. Now we can have a 2 billion hp mob and you're still dumb enoungh to resort to excluding have the classes in the game?<P>Wakening Lands: Woushi really does need to be re-examined. If you must have it guard the portal then please reduce it's aggro range! Running through Wakening Lands is tough enough with all the high level mobs wandering through it without having to play russian roulette with a dragon.<P>Crystal Caverns: I was lvl 53 when I went there so a bit over what it was designed for but it IS a great dungeon. If only we had more like this for the 50+ crowd.<P>PoG: Admittedly this was candy land pre-nerf but now drops are extremely rare - much rarer than Fear/Hate drops. I'd either increase drop rate slightly or consider further miscellaneous drops (like the wands and weapons in Fear).<P>Sirens Grotto: Ahahahahahahaha<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First, the faction triad is almost perfect except for one thing.. the royal factions (King Tormax, Dain, Yelinak).  Quests which raise this faction are utterly ineffective.  To raise a bottom of the basement Scowls faction to reasonable levels 1 point at a time is Tedium ad Infinitum.  The only realistic way to win his faction is to raid the royal areas of the other cities - problem is, the vast majority of the player population is not in a uber guild equipped to do this, you seem to forget this.  <P>This is a common theme in Velious.  The meat for the elite (this being the top handfull of guilds on a server), garbage for the rest. It was obviously made with love and precision, it quite frankly makes Kunark look like garbage, and yet most of us have slinked back, with our small to midsize guilds, to Kunark in disappointment, giving up on the quests we cannot complete, faction triangles we cannot ever hope to really take part in fully, amazing new lands for which we cannot muster VS/Trakanon armored level 60 legions to enter.. if we are choosing dreary, stillborn (where did that VS storyline go?) Kunark over a work of art like velious, something really is wrong.<P>Retune the factions, retune the zones to make them accessible to the average long term player - STOP TUNING THINGS FOR UBERGUILDS.  This game is not a challenge between the dev team and the elite guilds to see who can beat who.  But that's the impression Velious gives.  I think it's time you stepped back, conceded the war to the ubers, and started working to challenge and entertain the rest of the player base who have really been relegated to the sloppily designed, overcrowding bandaid lands of Kunark...  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Kael<BR>----<P>This zone is a descent zone. The monsters arnt too hard, and you can handle things with a group of 6 players. However, the loot in this zone is rather poor quaility and the exp modifer here is HORRIBLE. I have spent 8 hours of hunting in Kael before, and did not even get more then 1 or 2 blue bubbles, this does not seem right.<P>Waeking Lands<BR>-------------<P>This zone is not that bad, but there are holgrish which consnatny get stuck beneath the earth. Should be looked into<P>Velktors Lab<BR>------------<P>You really need to "tighten up" the level range in this zone. Is it a mid level exp zone, a high level raid zone? Hrmm<P>The Kobolds in this zone are to hard for the risk vs reward factor, and their HP, Magic Resist and attack speed should be looked into. As it stands now, only the "best group" can hope to handle this area with only 6 people, and the exp is VERY slow.<P>I'd suggest raising the ZEM on this zone, adjusting toe Kobolds accordingly so the "avg" 6 man group can handle it, and not just "the best", and possibly raise the level on the monsters leading upto the Kobold area.<P>Western Wastest<BR>---------------<P>This zone has monsters in it that are KOS, but give -COV/-Yelinak hits, and wil aggro on you regardless of your standing with COV/Yelinak, should be looked into.<P>The non-dragon mobs in this zone, such as the ice-worms, Wurms and Drakes could use some random drops added to them aside from the odd spell.<P>SkyShrine<BR>---------<P>From a hunting persepctive, I dont know. Havnt gone here yet, but I can only assume it suffers from the same ZEM problems as the other zones.<P>But from a town/quest perspective, this zone is HORRIBLE. Complete lacking of quests and a very non-working city area. Needs to be re-tuned.<P>Sirens Grotto<BR>-------------<P>bad bad bad evil zone. This is the goatass of all SOV zones. It takes all the worst game design elements and slaps them into 1 zone. This zone has<P>- Horrible pathing<BR>- Aggro though walls/floor/roof<BR>- Mobs that hit way to hard for their level<BR>- Green mobs that can charm lvl 60s<BR>- Mobs that have way to much HP<BR>- Mobs that are magic immune AND run<P>Suggestion for this zone?<P>-- Lower aggro radius on all mobs<BR>-- Lower mob density (to help cut back on trianing)<BR>-- Try to reposition all mobs so they are away from walls, adjust pathing to compenaste<BR>-- Make them check resists when casting spells, green mobs charming lvl 60 PCs with maxed MR is just absurd<BR>-- Lower their magic resist OR make it so they do not run<P>IceWall Keep<BR>------------<P>The dwarfs could use a few random drops other then frosted velium armour. The "well" area in this zone seems rather lacking, you can go exping htere and get the odd gem/spell. But it could use a few random drops and the Gruzzelnort bear guy could use a few items other then the cloak he has.<P>The monsters in the well are also a tad too magic resistant and have to many HPs, and suffer from the "hit to hard, fights take to long"<P>I think to help compensate for the longer fights, the ZEM in this zone needs to be raised.<P>Plane of Growth<BR>---------------<P>Fine as is. I dont go there often, find it horribly boring .. But I dont see any need to change it.<P>Temple of Veeshan<BR>-----------------<P>This zone deserves the "good idea gone wrong" idea of the year award.<P>Currently, you need the ancient tarnished, or unadourned armour from this zone to do the kael / skyshrine armour quests. These quests are MUCH harder to complete then Thudagrim quests or POG armour, yet have similar stats. Their stats should be noticbly better, or these drops moved to another location in the zone.<P>Aside from the named dragons in this zone, there are no item drops to speak of. With the difficulty of getting to this zone, and each individual encounter, there should be the chance for some nice random-drops here. <P>----------------------<P>In short. My general impression of SOV for the high-level group of players that are not raiding.<P>- The exp in most of the zones is way to low. Many players that are lvl 50+ are returning to zones like Sebilis/Chardok/Charisis to get exp. <P>- There are to many magic resistant monsters. Not only does this hurt enchanters as they cant mez/etc. It is also a big blow to wizards, as the power of wizards come from their AE spells, but the bread and butter of an AE group is the enchanter and their stuns<P>- Most mobs have to much HP to be considered "good exp", they hit to hard and ahve alot of hp, causing for long fights AND long down times. Tie this in with a low ZEM, and its just not worth the effort<P>- A lacking of good drops.. this is pretty self explinatory<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Biggest Problem with SoV was it was suppose to give higher level players more places to go.  I DARE you to take just one group of 55+ someplace to enjoy, explore, and get some experience.<P>Unmezzable mobs that come in twos or threes that have 15k hps and insane regen.  The mobs that con blue hit for well over 200 if not 300 and quad.  Alot of green mobs quad for mid 100s.<P>I was under the impression that SoV was going to give me somewhere other then selected parts of Karnors, Seb, Chardok and Charasis.  Instead it is someplace to go for people level 30 to 50 maybe lower, and uber guilds to go raid (I have no problem with the raiding, gives them something to do and other guild chances at the other mobs they previously didn't have a shot at).<P>As far as loot...some of it is good, I like the idea of being able to quest for stuff that drops in "uber" zones.  However, NO LOOT EVER should be BETTER then the epic weapons...EVER.  Something that DROPS should NOT be better then doing any of those quests.....I don't know what anyone was thinking, I don't care where it drops or how hard it is to get there.<P>I do however wish that maybe in future releases the equipment might not be so obviously better it isn't funny, but maybe it's about the same with different stats and/or effects....I mean it took alot of people month to obtain that full suit of cobolt upon the release of kunark, yet a week maybe to get full berzerker and it's an obvious choice because the berzerker gear is way better....<P>Also, simply removing the ability of use of spells in a zone is lame, always has been always will be. I mean why not allow the use of call of the hero....C'mon.  Take Velketor of instance, a single group can get significantly close to Velk. Why not let that one group go in and then just summon other people.  40 level 60 people do not have fun bashing low green mobs for an hour before they see blue.....or their target which could have been gotten to by one group.<P>CR - CR in most zones should not consist of finding a necro friend, buying coffins and summoning.  <P>Keyed zones:  something has to be done about this. I mean I personally don't really like the idea of keyed zones as all it does is take content away from people...taking keys away would help the overcrowding, but other then that....too many soul bound keys is causing problems.  Make a key ring to hold all keys, or make it so you do the quest to gane access to a dungeoun, not a key to gain access.<P>Well, that's about all.  I know I was highly critical, but if you want to improve SoV don't ask the ones that make it sound like the greatest thing to hit everquest.

</FONT><HR>To me, SoV shows clearly that the Dev Team can't think beyond the most linier scope. Pretty sad. What do I mean by that? Well, when they make a mob 'harder' they kick up its damage, its hp, its resistances, and its speed by a fixed ammount. Why not just create a 45th level mob with 100k hp that is NOT immune to spell (so wizards and such can nuke it) and have it max hit for 80 or so? The challange here would be in the 10 minutes of fighting which can be fun now and then.<BR>As it is now, Velious is a prime example of 'hybrids need not apply.' Only warriors have a remote chance of standing up to these mobs. Why would you ask a wizard to come along to nuke said mob for 8000 damage (after resists) when you could bring a rouge to melee it for 20,000?<P>For me, large raids are not fun every day. I don't really want to spend all afternoon waiting for 18-24 people to all get to one place to raid a dungeon. Honestly, a dungeon that is geared towards dragon raid sized partys ought to be dropping dragon quality loot along the way. In this regard, western wastes is nice. Probably could do okay there with 1 'uber' group, 2 pretty good groups, or clean house with 3. The thing is, almost every kill has a nice reward for someone.<P>Icewall vs Kael:<BR>Icewall you pull 48+ level mobs to the zone and kill them and are rewarded with ugly, but pretty nice armor. No need to wait till level 46 to go to the planes, just port your level 1 over to Icewall and hang around.<BR>Kael on the other hand you've got to go deap inside to get super rare drops to get your armor. On top of that, you need to return to Thurg AND collect various gems (mob drop only) for the armor.<P>Also, someone mentioned earlier.. Killing mobs in icewall gives royal faction in Kael. Killing mobs in Kael does NOT give royal faction with Thurg or Skyshrine.<P>All in all, Kael seems like a dead end for hunting there. In this sort of game where EVERYONE is going to be min/maxing, almost NO ONE will end up hunting Kael.<P>Kill dirfs: good faction with giants, decent rewards.<BR>Kill giants: crap reward, crap faction.<BR>Kill dragons: phat lewt.<P>PoG: Its the new farm. I don't think I'd change it, I'd just write it off as a learning experience. Knowing Verant, its gonna get made harder, worse drops, and all in all, mostly undeserable to go there. As it is now though, my friends have a blast going there.<BR>As for the 'good' classes... Where are the quests? I've seen maybe 1 quest per class, and they go something like, 'Please kill three giants in Wakening lands and bring me there heads'<BR>You say, 'okay, fair enough.'<BR>Then, 'oh, by the way, bring me the head of the Vindicator in Kael too'<BR>You respond,'...'<BR>Now, as I said earlier, most people won't bother hunting Kael because of the crap loot and much greater (but a LONG shot) rewards for being the giants allys. So, not only can you not get armor in PoG, you can't do PoG quests because all your PoG farming friends are friendly to the giants and won't help you.<BR>Since Druid/Ranger/Paladin armor doesn't drop in PoG, why not have quests for it there? Also consider that since a guild can farm PoG for 7 days and get everyone a full suit of class armor a quest for class armor there ought not be something crazy like "go kill the vindicator, the king, and the dain and return their heads to me for your ac3 +3 str bracer."<BR>Also, as far as I know, PoG is the only 'walk in' zone you can't 'walk out' of. Why? Hate requires a gate to get in so its reasonable to expect a gate to get out. You walk into fear, but its a hard battle to walk out. Why not have a 'walk out' gate from PoG in Tunare's tree?<P>Sirens Grotto: Um... Why? Other's have said enough about this. On a scale of 1 to 10, Risk is 40, reward is 0.<P>Last note.. would it be possible to get some sort of tinted sunglasses iten or a 'filter sight' spell? All that snow in the day time is SO bright it hurts my eyes. I'm being serious too. I guess I could turn down my contrast, but then I wouldn't be able to see other parts of my screen.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The magic resistance is slightly crazy.  I'm one of the 11 people or so on my server who actually kills dorfs.  I spent 10 hours there yesterday...Turgur's Insects wasn't mem'd the whole time.  Why bother, it's not like it can land on ANY of the dorfs, even after Malo/Tash.<P>Looking at it from an objective point of view though, it's kind of obvious that it's balanced that way.  Dwarves have less hp and hit softer than giants, but giants are FAR less resistant.  Kinda balances out overall, but ****s some classes in the process either way.  Our most successful dorf group so far was 60 shaman (myself), 60 cleric, 57 cleric, 60 Warrior, 60 Rogue, 59 Mage W/Epic.<P>Siren's Grotto is just useless.  Soon after the release of Velious, we took like 30 level 57+ people there.  Eventually 8 sirens aggro'd through the floor, EVERY tank was slowed within 30 seconds,  and they chain casted gravity flux (which landed almost every time vs me (and most everyone else) at level 60 with 215 magic resist) while killing us quite rapidly.  A big hearty *** when it comes to this zone.<P>Necropolis is obnoxious, add more non-melee loot to the drop tables.<P>Kael is my favorite zone.  I wander around it watching raids die.  Now that my Tormax faction is finally amiable, I can watch even more raids die!  All kidding aside, it's a fun zone, but you should add some gem, general, and alchemy merchants.  If you want it to be less convienent than Thurgadin, add them to Tormax faction, which is kind of a pain in the ass to get up.  Took me like 150 royal guards, Chamberlain kill, Seneschal kill, 200 delivery quests, etc. to get it to amiably.  Being as Royal Guards drop no real loot other than level 55 spells, it's irksome.  And no, no matter how much harder Tormax is, 6 people can't kill Dain Frostreaver...no matter how many times we tried. <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>You tell your group, 'Grats well Sitten!'<P>Ahem, where was I.  Western Wastes is a cool zone, and you should look to it for what people like.  LOTS of loot, but without being monty haul.  Some dragons can be done with 3 people, while others require 30.<P>Let me stress this.  The ability to do things with one group is VERY important to most players.<P>Plane of Growth is an example of that as well.  You CAN break and kill with 6 people, however you'll get far less drops than if you do it with 30.  There are challenges for 30 people in the zone, like Ail the Elder or Rumbleroot.  My recommendation for PoG is to add MORE treants like that with guaranteed drops.  It makes it harder for smaller groups, though still possible with some care, and makes it more desirable for larger groups.  Basically upgrades the difficulty without decreasing drop frequency or the like, which is what I think people want (the drop rates are no higher than Plane of Fear's).<P>What else...ah.  Wakening Lands SUCKS!  I can't even cast spells there on my older computer due to the frame rate.  My new computer (1.5 gigahertz and other specs to match) can KIND of handle it.  And if you drop clipping at all, Wuoshi sees you before you see Wuoshi.<P>Skyshrine apparently sucks less than when I went there (thanks lack of itemization from zone in to Seer), so I won't comment.<P>To recap:<P>Less magic resist, please.<BR>Less undercons, please.<BR>Add a massive exp bonus to most of the zones to make hunting in them give comparable exp to sebilis or chardok, please.<BR>Siren's Grotto sucks like a fox, make it suck less, please.<BR>Make Trakanon drop more Donal's breastplates so that our group of 6 can kill more, please.<BR>As long as I'm dreaming, give me a pony, please.<P>And that's why saying please too much devalues the point of the word. <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Gathu the Tactician, Troll Oracle.<BR>Fenadiel, Troll's Dragonmule 52 Monk.<BR>Gathwar, Troll's Uncreative level 51 warrior, and rising fast.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>EQ as a whole needed more Pick-Up Group friendly areas. I was hoping Velious would bring such areas to the game as well as bring areas for Guilds with Raiding lifestyles.<P>However, Velious did not. Only on the first week was I able to get Pick-Up Groups, but after that I could not.<P>Theoritically, East Wastes and Great Divide should play like a Pick-Up Group friendly zone, but it does not.<P>East Wastes is semi Pick-Up friendly for 30-45,but definitely not for players around 48-52. The Orcs are the main attraction and getting groups with that camp is like getting a group in a popular dungeon. Which means you're on a list, IF there is a list being kept in the first place.<P>Great Divide, should be Pick-Up Friendly, there's the Giants Fort and the Wurm Cave. Why is no one there? Actually there are people there, but they are usually farmers(what are they farming? I thought spells could be bought now....) or high level pet classes doing "something" that seems to ellude and not include anyone else.<P>No Pick-Up Groups of Giant Hunting Players in Kael either.<P>Besides EW and GD, everything else in Velious is BYOG (Bring Your Own Group). Perhaps you intended by design for Velious to be BYOG, thus catering to the well organized Guilds filled with players with no RL responsibilities. But the impact of not introducing more Pick-Up Group friendly areas for the 50+ means the very small limited Pick-Up Group areas (for 50+) in Kunark are still over crowded.<P>As it stands currenlty I dedicate perhaps too many hours to EQ a week. Im not casual, but yet I still have troubles getting into groups. I do not play an undesirable class either. I am a part of a Guild, but my Guild is probably prototypical of most Guilds. That being Guilds that are formed around friendship and not necessarily around cold strict efficiency. This means, we have players in a variety of time zones, limited number available during overlapping hours of play that can group with each other, and if they could, their classes are incapatable in composing an efficient or even survivable hunting group. (ie, 5 rangers and druid or something like that)<P>With this typical play enviroment, one has to fend for himself till the next Guild Raid (which doesn't yield much exp anyways). Fending for yourself means getting into Pick-Up groups in the meantime.<P>Right now, Pick-Up groups places for the increasing population of the 50+ Players are way overcrowded. Places like Karnors and O.Sebilis. The chances of me getting into a group within 2-3 hours upon entering these zones is very very low to none. Burning Woods and Skyfire provide some hunting for the 50+ too, however I can never get a group there because they are near empty of players. Thus, those zones are BYOG.<P>The counter arguement that can be made is: "Perhaps you should make a group in a crowded zone and take them to an under-crowded zone." <P>It's a good idea, and several people have tried it. However, it is rare because the reason people are in the crowded zones to begin with is because they need/seek items that drop in that zone.<P>Wrapping up my post here, basically...it would have been nice if Velious alleviated the problems of Guild Raiders in overpopulated zones as well as over population in Pick-Up Group zones. It only solved the former....( Maybe ). EQ could still do with some more Pick-Up Group zones for 50-55 players and 56-60 players.<P>Possible solutions could be re-tuning both under populated Kunark and Velios zones to drop more attractive loot that draws more players making them more Pick-Up friendly.<P>Mud-Flation is a concern I understand. However the loot need not be uber. It just has to be worth something. Even if it's nothing players want but something NPC Quest givers give money for or whatever.<P>Seems to me there are two types of loot in EQ,<BR>1. loot that is worth very very little (1-100pp)<BR>2. loot that is worth a HUGE amount (10k-80k)<P>However, that's a whole other topic. . . .<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'll comment on the Velious zones I've hunted in, from the perspective of a level 36 - 39 enchanter (levels achieved while in Velious).<P>Iceclad Ocean:<P>The cougar hunting next to the gnome huts was very good.  The occasional drops were great, not overpowering and even useful to some characters of the level that were hunting there.  Decent solo, decent in groups.  I did both charm soloing and full grouping.<P>The gnoll camp is great, I love how the gnolls freak out when the turtle comes by... one thing though...  They let the turtle kill them one by one.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif">   If the whole camp rushed the turtle they could take it for sure, but they all stand their scared out of their boots until the turtle finally gets close enough to the "boss gnoll" that he aggros.  The gnolls should really team up when the turtle comes by.<P>The boat is pretty slow, anyone with sow and levitate skips it because the boat doesn't need to zone.<P>Tower of Frozen Shadow<P>Great design!  I love the portals...  no huge trains to the entrance!  Thus far I've been to level 4, grouping all the way.  I wouldn't want to solo here.<P>The first floor is a bit frustrating because for any group that just wants to move to the next level it requires camping a load of greens for the keyholder to spawn.  We spent over an hour on the first floor with no keyholder.  <P>It also isn't a viable area to hunt in because if you're low enough to get exp off the skeletons (the majority of mobs in the 1st level are skeles) that means the rest of the mobs on the floor will wipe you out easily.<P>The second floor, library...  As far as atmosphere goes you guys couldn't have done better!  Sounds, mobs, voices, *shivers*.<P>Again my complaint would be the rarity of the keyholder, Angry Librarian.  We camped this zone for 2 hours without seeing her once.  She does drop some very useful items  (ie. homework, I love it because it fits in range slot)  If that's why she doesn't spawn very often then I'd suggest lowering the drop rate of her items and increasing her spawn.<P>3rd and 4th floors:  Was in a full group for these... where they already had the keys so I can't comment on keyholders.  Again the level 4th keyholder was a big yawn.  Was there for over 2 hours and never saw it.  Again if you're concerned about their items then make them rarer drops but increase spawn times.<P>East Wastes.  Great both from a solo and group perspective. Some drops are useful, others are nice enough to pass on to newbies at least. (like the walrus tooth and uthgor armor)<P>That pretty much concludes my Velious adventures.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
