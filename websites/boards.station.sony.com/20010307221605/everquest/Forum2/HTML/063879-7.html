</FONT><HR>I have spent 140 days of playing time on my cleric. That is 3360 hours or basically the same as working a full time job for over a year and half. So excuse my arrogance when I say I have a better idea what it is like to play this class then most anyone that actually works at Verant.<P>Changing the cast time of the PoG/Cleric Quest BP's to one minute makes them completely and utterly useless. As someone stated earlier the Donals BP is totally different since multiple BP's could be used to heal one person, with the PoG bp since it is a heal over time you can't have multiples of Celestial Heal stacking. (Yes it would over write it if cast by a higher level but still won't change the healing amount) Any mob over 55th level can outdamage the healing of the PoG BP so by saying it was destroying the game is totally false. This spell heals 300hp every 6 seconds plus the cleric is tied up for 20 seconds as is by using this BP. So in many situations this BP is already some what useless since I can't be committed to healing a tank with a 20 second heal as if the enchanter or wizard starts getting hit I can't interrupt this spell to heal them.<P> So by changing the casting time to one minute is insane, why would I even use it when even if I was OOM I could med up that much mana without clarity and cast this spell. I wouldn't even use it during down time because that the minute it takes to cast I could be medding. No sane person would use it during a fight as the person would be dead before the heal ever hit.<P> As much as you would like to think it is over powered it is NOT! As is I mostly use this BP after wipe outs to heal the resurrected people. In fights with the Uber mobs out of 8 clerics we some times have 1 cleric using this BP but lately we found we can't even do that as we need someone else to heal the other clerics after they get beat on from healing people.<P> Unless you want to replace my PoG BP with a Butt Cushion of Mana Regeneration please leave my PoG BP the way it is, I earned it and I don't care that you "think" it ruins the game. The only thing it has ruined is my attitute towards Verant.<P>Bunion Steeltoe<BR>58th Level Templar<BR>Innoruuk<BR>The Pantheon<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well verent has nerfed clerics with the mark of karn nerf. Then come the donals nerf. Now the pog nerf. But an enchanter sucking mana or a necro is ok. Now we get agroed non stop so bgh turn into big game crs. Verent how about giveing us anything other than a slap in the face. Play a cleric sometime. Ow by the way nice affect on pog pants what a pharse. 100 hp heal on group. Over 50 tanks have 4000 to 6000 hp. Umm ever tried to heal a group with that. I mean if your gonna put something on them make it worth while. At least one of the pieces summons food and drink seems thats all we are good for anymore. But at least we can make 10 copper selling food to newbies for all the time and effort we put into our char.<BR>   THe problem is you give other classes incredible upgrades and nerf us. Well i think once the wizard spells are done ill go back to my wizard or just quit this game. Everytime i invest my time into getting something you take it away. Hmmm lets see months camping manastone win one ow its useless in a month. 2 donals do 30 tracs ow wait its worthless now. 3 pog wahy bother doing anything in this game if its a good piece for clerics dont bother cuase it wont be for long.<BR>Thanks verant can we at least get a kiss on the next one</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I play a level 60 clerics, most of the time only for raid situations now, but yes my cleric is my main character. I also play a level 54 enchanter. I like being a group character, I enjoy being a "vital" part of a group. I like to be challenged and tested, that is why I chose to play the classes I play. I got the very first Donals Breastplate dropped off Trakanon for my guild. I *chose* to pass that breastplate along, and loot the very first Chestplate of Stability our guild obtained. I *chose* to sit in plane of growth for hours trying to help other clerics get their breastplates. Other clerics *chose* to spend ALOT of time questing for breastplates. And now..... well these breastplates are now even more worthless than those Donals breastplate we gave away.<P>So you have taken away our choices. We can no longer make an informed choice on anything, if in a month or two it will be changed.<P>My opinions on the balance issue:<BR>Let me talk about when I used this breastplate. <P>Very very rarely in a group situation, the risk of a mob changing agro just is too high to justify risking other group members lives, the only time I would use it was in downtime, after fights or rezes. <P>On raids, I would use this breastplate generally same times as indicated above to minimize downtime. If we had a bad pull and i went OOM I would use it in the hope that heals would get there on time. But when you have to wait 50seconds for a 1500 heal there is no guarantee that this will help you at all. It *may* save one person, it makes you a slightly better cleric to have around because of your ability to try and heal when you are oom.<P>OK lets talk UBER mobs.... well if you get to the point where you have to cast your breastplate then you are dead, in the 50 seconds it would take me too heal 1500 HP, the mob is quading for 800..... Ummmmm so in 50 seconds it could mow through 10-15tanks? and you of course cos of heal agro!<P>So its not unbalancing, it just makes us slightly better at the job we do, and isnt that what every piece of equipment upgrade is supposed to do?<P>I have close to the best equipment a cleric can get. I have worked hard for that. The more you take away from my class, the less I want to play it. Maybe i should retire my cleric and play my enchanter instead? Oh wait.... never mind, enchanters are useless in Velious too. I guess I should go play a rogue.<P>If you go through with this change there are two things you need to do also:<BR>1) you need to reset POG factions.<BR>2) you need to give every cleric who has a chestplate of stability (or quest breastplate) the opportunity to trade it in with a GM for the new breastplate if that is what they chose.<P>I WILL continue to play my cleric. Why? Because of my guild, because of my friends, those are the things that make me continue to play this game. Because they need my rezes and the healing I can manage. My cleric will be active until the day I quit the game, you are just pushing that day closer.<P>Naelana M`hir<BR>High Priestess of Innoruuk<BR>Sol Invictus<BR>Tribunal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>My name is Morniel, a level 60 cleric on the Tunare server. I have a PoG bp, have had one since they first started dropping (when they had a 6 second cast time).<P>When I heard last night that my bp is to be the next target of the nerf stick (for the second time), I was pretty upset. It's my favorite item... and this nerf hurts. A one minute casting time basically removes the use of the bp from combat.<P>Over the past 24 hours, I've thought about it. I've paid attention to when I use it, thinking about whether/how that use will need to change/end. I've thought about why some of those uses aren't in Verant's 'vision' and what use they intended originally. Here are my thoughts.<P>First - how do I use it? In a bunch of ways. <P>~ For mana regen when I am in the old world. I can 'crunch' mana by using a mana stone and then using the bp on myself. I can probably go from oom to fm in about 3-4 minutes using this method. <P>While this is great for recovering from buffs (a harmless use I think), I can also use it during combat to regen mana. I no longer hunt in Solb, but when I was level 57 I spent a fair amount of time duo'ing the Efreeti Lord with a 57 monk. The bp was a key factor in this ability, partly because of my ability to regen mana with it. I suspect that this is part of what Verant wants to stop.<P><BR>~ Chain casting it on a tank during combat. With that same monk, I also hunted dwarves in Icewell. We were able to duo them quite efficiently - including Royals and Watchers, which the monk was able to pull singly. Granted, I had to supplement heal with real mana - bp ch bp bp ch - but it was a major factor in our ability to kill them as a duo. Adding in a bard and a warrior, the four of us were able to kill the Chancellor - a mob that I really don't think Verant intended to be killed by less than a full group of players. <P><BR>~ Supplemental healing in a group. Use of the bp in a full group is a little limited. I can use it as long as I don't have to worry about my enchanter getting pounded, for example. I don't use it in pressed combat unless I am forced to, too risky... casting a bp when your group is in combat in Siren's Grotto, for example, is just asking for one of your casters to get pounded and die while you are waiting for the cast time to finish. <P><BR>~ CR clean up. Any time I res someone, I heal them up a cast from the bp - as long as they are of a level to get it. It's also an incredible aid to putting a wiped out raid back on their feet. Clerics with epics res people back in, bp clerics can heal the newly res'd. I loved this, it was a great elimination of downtime. This use won't really be taken away, although getting people back up in a rush situation (ie before a room spawns) will be a little more difficult.<P><BR>The increase in casting time won't affect some of these uses very much. I'll still be able to crunch mana in the 'old world', just not as fast and not in a combat situation. I'll still be able to cast it on someone who was just res'd, it (again) just slows things down a little. <P>What I *won't* be able to do is chain cast it on a tank during combat (unless what we are fighting is dealing out less than 120 damage a tick, which is pretty much never at high levels). Nor will I be able to use it at all to do supplemental healing.<P>It looks to me like what Verant basically intended with this bp is that it only be cast during downtime (with the exception of casting on the puller right before a pull). I can respect that (as much as I don't like it). However, it occurs to me that I could spend that one minute cast time medding instead of using my bp, and gain back significantly enough more mana than I would need to cast Celestial Elixir... So I'm not really going to use it unless I am full mana to begin with. This means it's not restricted just to downtime, but also to times when I am not grouped/hunting (pretty much the only times I'm going to be full mana). <P>The bp will be nice for when I res someone on the fly, and potentially for crunching mana in the old world... but that's about it.  /sigh. I'm going to miss the other uses a lot. I am somewhat resigned to it at this point, though - because I think that this decision has been made and just isn't subject to change, no matter how much I don't like it.<P>What I am really curious to know is what the replacement bp will be. I assume that the stats will be identical or at least comparable, but that the effect will be different. What I would really like to see as the effect on the new bp is a buff - ideally Aegolism, or an entirely new buff that is similar but gives fewer hp/ac. This would be an incredible mana and time saver, while not affecting combat at all - it will simply reduce downtime, which I think was the idea behind this bp to begin with. If you think that Aegolism is too much, then Aegis would be another great affect. I absolutely love my Donal's legs because they let me get a wiped out group/raid back up on their feet fast - getting a mana free Naltron on everyone can make a big difference. <P>Anyway, I don't want to ramble on too much. I'm not happy, but I guess I can see where Verant is coming from. I just hope that the replacement bp will have a useful effect.<P><BR>~Morniel Everhate, Teir'dal healer of the 60th circle<BR>Tunare Server<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I play a lvl 59 cleric and was second on my server to get the PoG BP.  I have really enjoyed its uses for saving down time and the whole new level of skill it brought to trying to use in groups.  I can honestly say this item is NOT unbalancing by any means and only serves to enhance a clerics ability as is befitting a cleric of high enough level to get one.  If it absolutely has to be nerfed why not just raise the level limit on who can use it cause No Way is this thing going to unbalance any fight for a level 60.<P>I am beginning to feel like this thread is really just a support group for post-cleric-nerf stress disorder.  Those at VI have already made up their minds this item unbalances the game and don't give two &#!%'s what we think.  I still plan on playing my cleric when my guild needs me but don't plan on playing him for fun any more.  Actually, almost all the "old school" clerics in my guild play twinks and only mains when they have to.  <P>All I can say is that I am really disappointed in VI on this one.  They are taking away a lot of my fun for something that really has no impact on game balance.  They really don't have a clue, but think they do giving us a completely bogus explanation.  The math just doesn't work out on that excuse since it is almost the same infinite heal/delay ratio as a cleric with C2 using C heal.  Which is safer than getting stuck for 20 secs.<P>/prays they come to their senses and realize they are doing more harm than good to the game as a whole.<P>*Wakes up*.......goes to play twink<P>Gairloch Daimonios<BR>Eastern Keep<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I say you knew you were destroying your faction when you decided to get the BP and even though Verant is nerfing it the faction that you destroyed you did before you got the BP and hence it should not be reset.<P>Maybe there should be a way to regain faction with PoG but no they definately shouldn't reset it.

</FONT><HR>It's probably been said plenty of times, yet why not make a new spell completely that has like a 20 second cast time, has near the same healing effect, and have it have a 3-5 minute recast time on it (ie, make a spell specifically like rubicite aura).  That way you can keep the bp's but just add the different spell effect to the bp's.  That way you don't have to go through and write out new code to make the spell different on the bp than it is straight used.<P>Dovan Longtooth</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Let me tell you all a little store.  I first started my cleric with the thought that I would be doing my fellow residents of Norrath a great service by helping to prevent their death.  I dreamed of the day that I would be powerful enough to really make a difference.  I saw all the wonderous items I may one day have a chance to own and use to better the world.......but now that that day is close at hand I am alarmed to see these items are being taken from me one by one.  Our specialty is....let me thing.....ummmm.....can anyone help me here....OH...YEAH....*HEALING*....almost forgot because it seems Verant does not want us to be able to help people much anymore.  Rather than give us something we can use to cast a healing spell they would rather us be able to summon food or water with our armor......I know that is something I have been wanting a while......can't tell you how high the mana drain is for me to do that myself!  I think that the simple fact is that cleric have really not gotten that many nerfs over the course of EQ history compared to other classes and they just want to catch us up. I mean why else put good items in the game that you KNOW ahead of time will violate your sacred Vision (because you have put similar items in the game recently and had to change them) other than to just have something to nerf?  Now that may have been a bit acidic on my part but here are some cold, hard facts.....it is getting harder and harder for me to get a group as a higher level cleric thanks to most of the other classes getting upgraded heals.....the only time anyone wants me is if they need a rez..."No...we don't need you in the group.....but could you rez us?  Oh...you don't have the 98% XP rez??  Sorry we bothered you."  Why can't we have something wonderful for once? In the end it is not out fault that the game designers must have been lookouts at Pearl Harbor and did not see the need to put recast times on items, so why must we be punished for only wanting to help our fellow players.  THAT is why many people are pushing that account cancel button.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>A discussion regarding on our private forums that I thought I would share here in the hopes that some smart lawyer reads it.  I dunno if this is even possible, I know nothing about law really except that this just seems "wrong"<P>-----------------------------------------------<P>Bah it's just a cop out. It's much easier for them to say "Wow is this guy a bonehead!!" in their explanation. That is nothing more than poor leadership on their part.  I could work at Verant and make a 100/5 Rogue usable piercer, that doesn't mean that the supervisor who approves the item database would have to approve it. And yeah Thuulsa, your comments are right on the mark. In a single group environment this heal is just awesome whereas it's only marginally useful on big raids. The smaller the group size, the more this becomes a factor. I'm sure the group size that Verant is worried about is an ungrouped meleer and a cleric with a BP sitting right next to them.<P>It just really frustrates me from the fairness standpoint. Although I doubt anything will happen anytime soon since EQ is really the first MMORPG that was extremely successful, I truly think that there are grounds for legal action with respect to changing items that were obtained in an MMORPG retroactively. I'm not sure on the angle or the spin since I'm not a bloodsucking lawyer, but it's analagous to someone working for a month to buy a stereo system and then have the system manufacturer sneak in your house one night and disable Dolby Digital on your receiver and replace your 200 watt amp with a 50 watt one. So if any of you are smart lawyers, maybe you could pick up some cash with this one.<P>The really funny thing is, if they just stopped the item from dropping I don't think there would be so much of an outcry, but changing stuff that is ON peoples bodies is just flat out wrong, and I'm sure we will lose a signficant amount of high level clerics serverwide over this. We all know how critical clerics are to playing eq, and this could (I say could because we all know what a bunch of crackheads we are) result in a large exodus of high level players.<P>Does Verant care? Probably not... we are realistically near the end of our "useful" lives anyway. They just need to keep throwing stuff in the game to keep that level 30 player leveling... and levling slowly. It makes sense from a business standpoint, but it just shows that Verant is willing to screw over their long time supporters to turn a little extra profit. This neither inspires me to be loyal to them, or ever engage in another Verant product ever. So yeah, I'm totally vested in eq, but... the buck freakin stops here.

</FONT><HR>Those cleric breastplates should never have entered the game as they were. Don't you have anyone that checks these things before they enter the game to make sure they're balanced? Being able to chain cast healing spells should set off all kinds of alarm bells. I expect you'll be changing items that chain cast DD spells next. :P<P>I agree with the fact that they need to be changed but you should not have waited so long to do so. What's done is done though. You know, instead of increasing the casting times you could have had the items cost mana instead. Maybe cost 25% less mana than casting the spell normally but the cleric could still chain cast....until he's dry. Just a thought.<P>The amount of hate being generated from Healing is being reduced....good!<P>You're removing the cleric breastplate drops from PoG...bad! Not that stuff drops there enough to make it worthwhile anymore anyways.<P><BR>One all important item of note though...since you are balancing these items out how about balancing the mob encounters as well eh? You know, the ones that were beefed up to compensate for these items? Like oh, Velketor, Yelinak, some stuff in Western Wastes, etc.<P>And how about giving Clerics some nice high end spells like for example:<P>Divine Wrath: 1k AE spell, 600 mana, 9 hour recast time...hits everything within a certain radius of the cleric.<P>Divine Intervention: Complete heals the entire party. 500 mana, 3 hour recast time<P>You get the idea.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This has probably already been said as I read something like it in an earlier reply, and Absor obviously doesn't care but.....<P>How the heck is outhealing a mob that does 300 hp every 6 seconds overbalancing?  We can do that already.  Anyway, the last time a mob did 50 damage a minute or less was at what?  Fighting wans or zols in lower guk?  Yeah, I'm sure this BP would be INCREDIBLY overpowered fighting Juggernauts in Selibis.  /snicker  If this BP was kept in its current form, I would most likely be too lazy to do the quest.  It's a decent item, but not worth alienating all your 51 + clerics to nerf.<P>You keep throwing out meager apologies and plead to us that it is in the interest of the game.  Could that excuse possibly be slightly overused?  First, you destroy Mark of Karn, systematically destroy every cleric bp with an effect, then give some form of ressurection (Ehhh, wasn't this class defining?) to paladins and necromancers.  Oh, and don't forget remedy for druids (along with another heal spell) and shamans.  This was a condensed version of our nerfings.  <P>Here is an idea to give clerics a reason to feel something other than disgust!  Throw us a bone!  Something, anything to give us reason to play without worry of having our usefulness lessened at the next turn.  Oh, and if you feel like treading all over cleric "sacred ground" by sharing all of the things that make us clerics.  Just give us one tiny thing from each of the classes who defiled us.  I wouldn't mind having snare, a level one spell =). <P>Last of all, I've always wondered, why are necromancers equal in ability to kill undead?  Clerics wish to rid the world of evil and undead beings, our goal is to vanquish and clense the land of undead.  Necromancers can summon undead, charm undead, and become undead.  Is it just me or should the clenser of evil be *slightly* stronger against undead, than he who controls them to do his bidding?......<P>Deladan<BR>High Priest, Bringers of Fire<BR>55 Templar<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

It isn't that much of a nerf because it was BARELY more efficient than casting a spell that most people prefer CH to anyways.  The only reason they would use CE over CH is to avoid massive aggro which was recently bestowed upon them.<BR>Bottom line:  Stop wigging out because a few uberguilds killed the Velious mobs you thought to be godly.

All of a sudden FoH shows up with 24 players, 12 of them handling their Epic weapons, and that critter goes down. Boom, they will immeidately tell you ...

It's the fact that they are never explained, or discussed. They are just plain .. exploded on people's heads. And this, is the one thing that will kill this game faster than any other.

</FONT><HR>I do not have any of the armor in question here, but several things about this "fix" do bother me.  Verant will be nerfing the PoG and other Velious cleric breastplates, without putting a suitable replacement into the game one the SAME patch, and not putting it off, so that way it doesn't get put aside for several months.<P>  Also, I'm not sure if this was a typo, but a casting time of 1 MINUTE???  Come on now, that is ridiculous.  I think Complete Heal with 10 seconds is bad enough, now someone will have to wait 6 times that long for the spell to be cast, 60 seconds to be interupted, 60 seconds to not be medding.  A LOT can happen in 60 seconds.  You should finish reading this post in less than 60 seconds.  If I had just completed the quest or killed the mob who drops these breastplates, after spending HOURS of time getting it done, and then having them changed to something like this.....well....I would be EXTREMELY upset, spending my time on something that is now useless.<P>  Well, that is my 2 copper pieces.  I think Verant dropped the ball releasing this so soon after the Donal BP change, and not even waiting to institute the new replacement breastplates right away.  This is gonna make the Clerics of Norrath think that Verant is out to get them, regardless of what the real intentions are, its not good press.  Everyone pays good money each month to play the game, and to reach the level of these breastplates, they would have to spend a sizable portion of their time to the game as well.  Please realize the impact of your changes from our perspective.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>What Xathae Said.<P>You guys have some ****ty PR people.  Instead of yanking the hard work away from everyone, and believe me, 1 minute is just stupidity by Verant to do this, why not give those that already have one an option to trade it for the new effect?  Why not make the new effect Celestial Healing?  <P>Or if nothing else, give us a 25 HP per tick self regen like the Iksar Ceremonial BP or something in the least *USEFULL*.<P>It was your damn mistake, dont totally kick us in the nuts for it, compensate us for your obvious mistake.  <P>   Here is what the current situtation is like:<BR>   <BR>   Pretend you work for a whole a year to make a living, and when you get some spare cash you buy this uber GPS system, that lets you see into the backyards of any person on earth, to boot.  <P>   The company, realizing how devastating it is to privacy, shuts down the image service, and tells those that bought one, "Sorry, the 500 extra you paid was well spent, but tough luck, you dont get our money back since you still have a good GPS system"<P>   Those company's are brought to court, but since its your game, all the legal mumbo jumbo makes this impossible.  Its a shame that Verant does something like this though, and it shows that you are complete and utter A-Holes for this.<P>57 Templar of Karana?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Abashi,<P>If a spell designer can do the math to show how this is unbalanced in a sentence or two in a post, why can't Verant have the same spell designer review this types of items prior to putting them in the game?  <P>I'm not high enough level to have the item in question, so I can't say that I can really care about this change.  However, I *am* concerned about the level of quality control Verant has on it's game design team (or whatever the department is called).  For the sake of a simple review by someone knowledgable about the spell effect, you can save a TON of ill-will that pulling the item out at later date causes.<P>It's not that we can argue the reason for the change.  I mean, come on:  the math is right there.  HOWEVER, Verant needs to get it's act together to keep these types of things from occuring in the first place.  It only exacerbates the problem when it affects a class where this has happened in the past (Mark of Karn, Donal's Breastplate, etc), not to mention that we're still a little raw over the whole hate fiasco.  <P>Fiasco?  Yes, that's an appropriate word.  After so many attempts by you and others exorting us to just try them out, it seems that you yourselves have agreed that it was a bad idea.  Again...it's all math.  All numbers. DO THE MATH and work this stuff out before you subject it to the public.<P>Change shouldn't be a painful thing.  A lot of what was done over the last 6 months has done a lot to smooth the game out.  However, Verant shouldn't be in such a rush to throw in "enhancements" before they playtest this stuff.<P>-Mattatron Aestivalis, 38th Cleric<P>P.S.

They are making half changes with no regard to the players they are effecting.  They should have saved this nerf until they could give specifics on the replacement BP.  They should have waited on the agro change until they had tested it and got it right.  Instead they are doing stupid things in an incompetent and half-arsed way.  I guess it is not enough to make questionable or poor decisions they have to follow it up with poorer implementation.  I hope they get those QA positions filled with some competent people and fire some of the useless people there.<P>I have seen poor implementation in projects before and I always point it out.  It is my job to anticipate problems and fix them before they are noticed.  So I have to plan for the errors and mistakes I know others will make.  If this level of performance was achieved in my organization someone would be fired very quickly.  If I had failed to anticipate the problems and have a recovery plan in place the person getting fired would be me.  I would think VI would have hired someone who could look at the larger picture and still see the details.

None, and I mean none of our concerns about our class were adressed.  I was actually looking forward to the patch, even though I knew the Donal's BP was going to be nerfed (which btw doesn't even work right.  When the buff is on myself I can't cast on anyone else /laugh).  I was expecting some neat upgrade like -gasp- invisibility (self-only) or something drastic such as that.  Or perhaps they would replace that silly pet with an undead DoT.  Instead they're looking at temple ports like they're a good idea.  All it would be is easy access to a bank.

</FONT><HR>Well, though I'm far from supportive of nerfs in general, they are correct about this one.<P>&lt;waits for the barrage&gt;<P>Basically, any non-mana-using items that provide either damage or healing are risky.  They CAN be balanced (depending on cast time, recast time, damage/healing provided), but they are inherently risky.  The Donals was broken... and far too powerful.  Should they have revised it with a downtime reducing capability?  Probably.  Should they do the same with these?  Probably.  However, their hearts are in the right place.<P>Don't get me wrong... VI has used the nerf cannon in many situations where it was unnecessary.  The healing agro change was one of the worst nerfs in this game's history (and is being repaired).  As a veteran cleric, I certainly remember the heal-range nerf and the DA/DB stun nerf... both of which were unnecessary.  Yet, in this specific case, they are right.<P>My preference would be to alter the effect of all these breastplates, but NOT create a "new" item... just fix the old one.  Personally, I would have MUCH preferred the 56th res spell to be on the BP, not on the Epic.  The idea of the Epic Weapon being just a raid-res stick is kinda silly imho.  Letting the epic weapon have some sort of hardcore undead nuke or the like would have been infinitely preferable to me... but that's just my opinion.<P>Anyway, I'd still prefer a fix rather than a nerf... but either way these items were broken and needed addressing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
