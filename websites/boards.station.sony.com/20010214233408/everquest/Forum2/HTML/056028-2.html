</FONT><HR>KrenkFeen<P>If want you say is true, and please do give us an actionable reference to the information you are quoting, then the pictures changes completely.<P>I was expressing my position by accepting that the "Things that fall on the ground are fair game" policy was, in fact, Verant's policy.<P>There was no bug here.  That item dropped to the ground because it did not fit into the other players inventory.  A deliberate action. It was not because of some fat fingering of a key or inadvertant click of mouse.  That is the technical truth.  Verant has put in measures, such as the drop confirm dialog window, for such inadvertant acts.<P>However, I also believe that Verant wants everyone to play nice.  So, even though I appreciate the "evil" side of EQ being part of the world, Verant apparently doesn't.  At least this is true if your reference exists and your representation is accurate.<P>But I still feel strongly that the experience one gets from playing EQ is strongly diminished if any player can have any chosen act reversed.  I realize this particular act is against the rules so I am overruled by the higher authority.<P>Regardling your reference to morality in EQ.  Whew, that is a player by player choice.  EQ may try to legislate morality but it can effectively enforce it. As such you have both sides.  Since I tend to be on the side of moral acts, the immoral give me something to act upon.   You see, intellectually, I am interested in a game that has an operable good vs. evil system.  The evil ones give the good ones something to do. Moralistically, I would stomp that thief.  Unfortunately Verant has hobbled most of the good vs evil capabilities.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If I admit to being in the program I will be banned. If I admit to having been in the program I could be banned.<P>LordOberon-MiM, you are blatantly callous as normal. Maybe learning to think before you write may help you somewhat, for you are not an expert of all that is known to man. I do have experience in this particular matter, and no I can not post it. Catch 22. Now since I "learned" what I do know, the object I refer to may have been rewritten. They do that often. But the policy of item reimbursement should still stand as declared.<P>Players should not be punished for game bugs and exploits. Abashi once clearly defined this in a thread on these boards. Items can not be stolen when dropped to the ground in a bugged trade nor when dropped via a disarm.<P>Now if you think people should be punished for these obvious exploits, then you have a serious problem and I suggest help.<P>If Verant would simply fix this known and acknowledged exploit then I wouldn't have to try and defend others from the ignorant.<P>Contact your head GM. That is the only recourse. They do indeed have logs of this event, and can indeed force the return of the item even after time has passed. I am not saying that this will be done, as many a Gm and Guide can be just as callous as some of the above posters. (Big difference between a GM and a guide Oberon, learn a little eh.).<P>The log should clearly show a trade in which the item immediately falls to the ground, and the other player picking it up. That's all the proof they need.<P>I come here suggesting a real methods to help someone. Many others come here to ridicule the problem. What is wrong with you people that you rejoice in the misery of others?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>KrenkFeen,<P>Hmmmm, your argument started out well stated but it got disappointing when you had to resort to:<P>"and anyone who wants to argue over this is an @@@@@@@."<P>What's up with that.  It doesn't further your argument.  No one is what you claim to them to be just because they argue against your point.  It only detracts from what started out as a good agrument.<P>However, you still make a claim that the transaction was "bugged".  How is that so?  Are you asserting that it is a bug to have any item fall to the ground because it does not fit into the target inventory?  Are you saying that the ONLY way an item should EVER go to the ground is when you intentionally drop it and even then after you confirm that you want to drop it?<P>Now, if that is what you are saying then it has to be proven that that is Verant's policy.  If it is, then its a bug.  If it isn't stated as such, then it was a poorly executed transaction.<P>If it is a bug, then my assertion remains.  A GM should intervene with a bug.  If it isn't a bug, then a GM should not.<P>I will always be the first to admit that "should" have no bearing whatsoever except in informing Verant of what their customers desire. What does have bearing are the rules or policies that are in place at the time of the event.  These forums are packed with "shoulds" but they are all irrelevent in the face of the rules or policies.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>While it is possible that a scam is being played based on MY morality, it is highly unlikely.  I was paid in full for the item, thus the buyer must not have expected me to *automatically* refund him when he dropped the item. Now I am a honest guy and I do hold myself to a higher moral standard than some choose to so I will take it upon myself to split or refund the total amount if the lead GM does not wish to help resolve this case. (petition still pending)  The real problem that I personally have, beyond the morality of this situation, is the lack of control that I feel. I can't exact some form of retribution on my own "policing our own" , the laws governing Norrath wont allow this... and the "law" (Guides-gm) won't or cannot help. It is extremely infuriating to not be able to protect my own interests.  I know some will say I am no better than the thief himself for wanting to take revenge, but when the law doest protect the citizens, the citizens need to protect themselves.. thievery will flourish if there is no retribution.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I appreciate your comments Net, and in fact, all comments.  If I didn't care about the greater good then I wouldn't persue this issue as I was paid. As I see it, there are several tangible issues at stake here.<BR>1. Is the Wurmslayer not fitting in a bag and susequently being dropped a bug? And on a greater scale, shouldn't any trade that will leave items on the ground require a confirm box?<BR>2. Do the Play nice policies come into play here?<BR>After these 2 points have been dicussed we must delve into the psychological aspects. I play EQ to have fun and get away from "Real Life", an experience like this ruined my "EQ day" and has generally left a sour taste in my mouth regarding the game.

</FONT><HR>Why assume it even dropped?  It's not like you have time to look down and see it on the ground, unless you already are looking there.<P>So the supposed buyer gets the item but then instantly says, "I didn't get it."  The friend lurking nearby takes on the role of the person picking up the item.  The supposed buyers gets some or all of the plat back and disappears, saying give me a tell if you get the Wurmslayer back from the GM.  Meanwhile, the seller petitions about the person who picked it up, yet even if the GM were to investigate, they wouldn't find any indication that that person picked up a Wurmslayer.  <P>Think outside the box... <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, like most threads that go more that a few posts, its because there are several controversial angles to the thread.<P>This one is no exception. What we have going here is:<P>1. Morality.  Should an evil deed such as "stealing" an item be allowed. It is stealing simply by virtue that the WS did not belong to the thief who took it.<P>2. Bug.  Should trades be protected by the software from any sort of unintended action such as the case here.<P>3. GM intervention.  Should GM's intervene in avoidable (i.e. not a bug) actions because of the Play Nice policies.<P>4. Play Nice policies. Should a thief stealing a dropped item be considered not playing nice.<P>5. EQ world. What is the EQ world?  Is it a fantasy setting where there is no law and order, no justice, just awareness of how things work?  Should how things in RL bear upon how things in EQ should work?<P>If any of these points are discussed, they will surely draw well-formed strong opinions on both sides.  Who is right then?  What should be done?  Well, I think it all boils down to what the individual involved let happen and which side the GM choose to take.  I think that is the realities of EQ.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It is common knowledge to many if it's on the ground it's fair game.  What I find curious though is the fact you only gave half of the money back to the buyer (if I understood your post correctly).  Can this be seen as you stealing since the other party never received the item you sold him?  Maybe, just maybe you and this dwarf are scam artist who travel across the zones repeating this same scam to unsuspecting dupes over and over, just speculating mind you, not accusing.  Take some responsibility for not assuring that the transaction went smoothly, because if you hadn't provided the opportunity for the item to be stolen it never would have.  Life ain't fair, it ain't never gonna be fair eat it, swallow it, accept it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Sorry to tell you Oberan, but on Rallos the guides can and HAVE taken action on this topic. 10 days ago a female character dropped a backpack with a Jacinth and a Diamond. Another character picked it up and refused to give it back saying "Hey, you dropepd it...". The female character petitioned and said the guy who picked it up would not give it back. Guy who picked it up handed it to a friend to pass to another character of his who has a jewelery skill. Guide shows up (I believe his name was Googy or something...watch for him and you'll see him). Guide reports that characters are refusing to give back the items and they are now subject to suspension. Well, I know the character who was holding the bag and he is still currently suspended. But it is under review by the GMs. So guess what? Guides will intervene.....But not in a fair manner. I know I have lost all respect for them and their attitudes which is funny since I had a very good opinion of them not too long ago.<P>---The Reverend</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;5. EQ world. What is the EQ world? Is it a fantasy setting where there is no law and order, no justice, just awareness of how things work? Should how things in RL bear upon how things in EQ should work?<P>There is law and there is order, and justice in EQ. It is not real life. It has published rules, and non-puplished rules. It has support staff that know what they can and cannot do,  and some who are clueless.<P>Should there be GM intervention here? Yes<P>Why? Because in the manual it states thre is a safe trade capability. It does not state, safe, but you have to do.......something to make it safe, it says safe. When a transaction occurs between players the implied safety requires GM/Guides to be Police.<P>Will it be fair? nope. <P>Why? Because all GM/Guides are not equal. They are people, and they make the same mistakes we all do, except theirs is easier to see.<P>Is it a bug? of course it is, because it violates the safe trade window statement.  If buyer cannot accept the item, then it should be canceled and all items/money should go back to orignal holders.<P>If it was not a bug, why is it being abused on all servers? Why did people start saying "Let me inspect your wurmslayer?" Just to hit cancel and see it drop, so they could grab it.<P>It is an expolit plain ans simple. It is an unfair advantage. It is against game design.<P>Someone who throws a wurmslayer on the ground , and someone walks by and picks it up is working as designed. Cancelling a trade/watching a trade for a possible drop is cheating, just as much as finding a spot a mob can not hit, can not get to, or abusing a quest to advance quickly.<P>Saying stuff happens does not fit in EQ. Because it was a world designed and controlled by humans. Which is why it has rules, and abusing those rules should carry penalties.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OutofPocket makes a compelling argument.<P>The "Safe Trade" assurance is in play here.<P>However, it is pretty obvious that the Trade window software does NOT check for available space, which is the same as all the other actions that are attempting to put something automatically into your inventory like looting a mob.<P>It is suggested that the "Safe Trade" assurance should be idiot-proof (just a term, not intended to cast any aspirsion on anyone) and to the extent that its not, then a GM should intervene.  <P>Well what I think is really to be drawn from this is the following concepts:<P>1. The parties involved could have been smarter about this and avoided any mishap.  And in hindsight have learned a lesson (as we have here on the thread, as well.)<P>2. Trading involves valuable items being exchanged via a software process. That process should do all that it can to assure the trade go as intended by the controls in the interface. When it fails, that is a bug. <P>3. GMs should intervene when the "law and order" has been violated OR when a bug occurs.  I think that this example can be validly argued that both those case apply.  With the "Play Nice" policy, law and order has been violated.  With "Safe Trade" assurance, the software has a bug.<P>BUG REPORT: Trade window does not check for available space before conducting the exchange.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Drewbles wrote: "on a greater scale, shouldn't any trade that will leave items on the ground require a confirm box?"<P>Every trade requires a confirm box.  The trade window *is* a confirm box.<P>There's a few things that need to be done to limit the possibility of these things happening:<P>1) Change autoinventory, such that it recurses into bag slots *before* going to the next main inventory slot.  What I mean by this is if I have an empty backpack in slot 1, and nothing in slot 2, and I loot an item that can go in the backpack, it should go there instead of into the main inventory slot.  If they changed this, it would be much easier to always keep slot 8 of the main inventory available for things like this.  As it now stands, if you try to keep a main slot open, you are forever manually opening bags and putting things in them.<P>2) If a person is trying to receive traded items and any of them will drop to the ground, instead of dropping them, the trade should go back to red and a message should appear in the chat box.  For the player receiving the items, it should say: "You do not have space for all of the items in the trade window.  Clear inventory space or press cancel to end the transaction."  For the player giving the items, it would say "The recipient of this trade does not have inventory space for the items.  You may press cancel to close the trade window and restart the trade."<P>3) It would be VERY cool if items had a "size" tag.  Granted, we've now got so many tags... magic, lore, nodrop, norent, slot, etc., but this would be really nice.  I remember buying a wrist pouch for my enchanter and being mystified that tiny daggers didn't fit in it.  They're "tiny", right?  Tags might be Infinitesimal, Miniscule, Small, Medium, Large, Gigantic, Humongous or something.  Then when you right click on a container, it will tell you the largest item size it can hold.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The designs must have thought about this and said that this is avoidable and therefore we are not going to disallow (or in another light, protect against) it.<P>Given this, I must now say that this is strictly a lesson learned situation on the basis of the "Safe Trade" assurance angle.<P>However, the "Play Nice" angle is still valid.  If it is a violation to "steal" something that validly has fallen to the ground, then a GM should go "arrest" the thief and return the "stolen" property.  But I am not confident that this is a violation nor am I yet convinced that it "should" be.  I still think that "intellectually" (as oppposed to moralistically) such acts add to the "flavor" of a world replete with scum and scoundrel and heros and champions. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Net<BR>You have forgotten that in the mind of  the buyer he had resaonable room in his inventory. He had large bags with empty slots in them. By that logic, the software is still faulty. Thus it is a bug unless you can prove that he should have known the item didn't fit in bags. Without a tag or in game mechanism this is impossible. I assume partial responsibility for not warning him myself, but in the 2 years of EQ this is probably the only weapon I have sold that required an inventory slot of its own.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You have forgotten that in the mind of the buyer he had resaonable room in his inventory."<P>Reasonable, yes for say 98% of all things.  But it did not have EXACTLY the room needed for a Wurmslayer.  A fact that COULD have been determined prior to the transaction.  A fact that WOULD have been determined if you and the buyer were aware that there are some SPECIAL CASE items that need additional attention.<P>The buyer could do little to avoid this. He did not have the Wurmslayer to determine its space requirement.  I am sorry to say, that the onus was on you.  You had it, you COULD have been aware that it would only fit into an open inventory slot (or a large sewing kit).  You weren't, so this unfortunate mishap occured.<P>Think of it this way... what if that whole thing went down but no one stole the WS.  I think you would of determined that the trade failed and that the WS was on the ground.  You would quickly pick it up and wonder what just happened.  After figuring it out, you would think to yourself "Wow that was a close call.  Good thing I now know that the WS needs an open slot".  No harm, different perspective.  You are upset because of "PART 2, Fallen Item stolen" of the story and rightfully so.<P>The Wurmslayer fell to the ground EXACTLY because the proper place for a Wurmslayer did not exist. The software can not be expected to handle SPECIAL CASES.  It dealt with the situation EXACTLY as is does for any item that does not have a suitable place for it to be received.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
