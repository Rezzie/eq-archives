</FONT><HR>Lets clear something up about the supposed "unresistable" Enchanter memory blur spells.<P>They don't work.<P>Memory blur works 100% on mobs below 35, after that it drops off fast; and there is NO "fail" message whatsoever (helpful huh?)<P>The higher level blur spells, such as blanket of forgetfulness and recurring amnesia are also problematic.<P>Recurring amnesia has never done ANYTHING for me...ever.  Its widely known to be broken.<P>Blanket may work.  About 33-50% of the time, and it is AE with almost no aggro.  That's nice.  Its also a big time mana-suck and has a VERY long recast time.  Worse, it hits PC's, so the spam is horrible.  That is not nice.<P>In the end, Mezz is a better bet to save the cleric, as is AE stun to give the healer a second or two to recover.  The bad news is, that in Uber encounters and in Velious, none of this will work.<P>I guess we can always cast Rune V and Bezerker Spirit on a Cleric that's getting beaten on.<P>Akariel, 52 chanter</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hmm dvin no I'm a shaman......oh wait I get agroed to when I heal..... Well I adapted my play to roll with the punches. Yes I have died healing others since that patch. How many time have you and your group kill a mob that could heal first???? Well now the mobs play like the players.<BR>Oh well flame me for be logical. What the mob suppose to be dumb and kill the tanks first then the healers. If anything should be fixed is ammount of damage a mob can do. I mean how many wizards that can hit u barehanded for 60 pts of damage( ex cythis in rathe moutain) I think the mobs should be more on level of players.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>let me kick this idea out and see what you think. <P>since now a cleric can't cast cheal (or at least not very often and live) the only other alternative is to add more tanks to the group.  tanks that can taunt too so they can pass a mob back and forth with each other and spread out the damage.  <P>with the recent trend to using more melees and less casting classes caused by velious i think this could be a bad thing.  just kinda thinking out loud   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I guess this means that we will have to group with enchanter so in a group you need cleric, enchanter, gater, warrior damage dealer and monk for pulling since if he is hurt the cleric cant heal him til the warriro and others have built up taunt.

</FONT><HR>Went to the hole to test, first CH the cleric got summoned (war at 2 bars), and even with a monk, warrior and rogue beating the hell out of it, we couldnt save the cleric.<P>Even scarier thing is seeing a large nubmer of clerics summoned 1 by 1 to the mob and getting killed by dual or quad 400's and more.  They stopped doing CH after that.  And we lost the tanks in larger numbers than ever.  Ended up with everyone dying:  clerics could NOT heal without being summoned and killed, tanks got too low and got whacked.  Pretty soon, it was just a few casters who got out while the last tanks bravely stood in there and died to let them survive.  We got the necro to summon corpses and let the clerics rez themselves and the rest of us.  Then the clerics went to go play their twinks and seconds.<P>Looks like there arent going to be any raids for a while.

</FONT><HR>Yes, would take 25 clerics instead of 7. Sorry I have bad recast time info. Still possible and would only need this if the 18 or 36 secs was not enough for the rest of the raid to pull the MOB off. Bonus would be that, all this time, the MOB would not be meleeing anyone for damage which has to be an advantage since they hit so hard. It may not be possible to get the 1 sec and 2 sec spells off but, then again, it may be possible. I don't think anyone has tested this yet. Come on guys, you who play level 60 Clerics know more than me. Let's toss around ideas instead of re-stating how bad things suck.<P>I believe many said that Trak was unkillable for weeks at first...

</FONT><HR>Speaking as a 55 cleric now, the problem is the fact that taunt is and always has been broken at the high level game.<P>People wouldn't be in such an uproar, nor would this be such a bad patch if taunt worked properly.<P>2 level 60 warriors were completely unable to taunt mobs off me last night after casting 1 Divine Light on one of the warriors.  I had to heal myself with Remedy 5 times while being beat on before the mobs would leave me and go after some other poor schmuck.  <P>Yes, I know how to control agro, my primary is a level 60 wizard.  I know ALL about controlling agro.  The current incarnation of the cleric, with this agro factor multiplied, is VERY bad.  Does it make the game unplayable?  No, but it makes it ridiculously frustrating, I have absolutely NO desire to play my cleric in a combat role now.  I will be using him for buffs/power leveling now... at least he's still good at that.<P>Fix taunt.  Up the taunt factor to match the hate factor.  If "Hate lists" on the mobs have been "broken" for 2 years now, then Kunark and SoV have been DESIGNED around those values.  Now, arbitrarily "fixing" them, breaks Kunark and SoV, making them much harder than intended, or even impossible in some cases.<P>As for that ridiculous little quip from Absor, who was quoting a Dev team member "Think how mad you are when Vox CH's after you've almost killed her."<P>People get MAD about that becuase Vox, somehow, manages to cast CH on herself with 40 people BEATING THE STUFFING out of her.  No PC in the world can get a CH off with 40 mobs beating on them. THAT's what's so annoying, the total imbalance between NPC/PC spell casting.  If Vox followed the same interrupt rules as a PC, people would not NEARLY be so frustrated when Vox tries to CH (as she never would).  Get a clue before you try to quote people.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

There has never been a healing spell, from level 1 minor heal up, that didn't cause aggro.<P>Pinacle:<P>Where are you getting these "ideas" from?  The patch message included the fact that other aggro factors no longer pertain.  Gods below, but talk about selective perception!<P>At the Same Time they reduced aggro on various spells, killed the taunt from weapon procs, left MR and mez resistant mobs unchanged, left HPs per mob unchanged, left damager per round unchanged, and made heals go up in the hate list by amount healed.<P>You can work around one or two of these things, but not all of them at once.<P>Quotes:<P>&gt;&gt;We reduced the amount of hate that can be caused by a proc.<P>&gt;&gt;We've capped the amount of hate that can be awarded to most casters,<P>&gt;&gt;We've redressed the amount of hate generated by heal spells......Heal spells will now generate an amount of hate more in line with the number of hitpoints actually healed<P><BR>That last one doesn't say per heal.  It says the total amount healed.  In some encounters I could get off two, sometimes three heal spells before I got aggroed with a single mob pull, but after that every time I healed again I was attacked again.

</FONT><HR>I honestly cannot believe what I am seeing here today. Do any of you have a clue? 50+, Clerics are the foundation of any group action, be it a exp group or a raid. 50+, enchanters are needed as well. Every group must have a tank(be it a player or a pet). Like it or not, the way the game works, you MUST have a cleric to do anything other than zone-in trash at seb and karnors, the occasional crap zones like skyfire, and the off handed goofy quest. WHY? Verant has made the game as such.<P>I hear people say heal at 80% instead of 20%. Sounds good right? Wrong! First, those heals such as remedy and celestial healing are 50+ spells. Read the patch message again CAREFULLY this time. You will see it if you do. The second part against this arguement is have you every actually USED SH or one of the lower powered heal spells on a tank? Have you? Can you tell me how much it actually does? Let me tell you. On a level 55 warrior/ranger/SK/paladin, SH will heal 1, yes 1, bubble of health. Ok, np if the tank is at 80%, but what about on the new monsters like Velketor that are level 75(read: only wizards with lure can land anything short of an unresistable spell on them), QUAD, yes quad was added to the new Velios mobs unlike anything we have ever had to deal with before that wasn't dual-wielding, 850 max dmg, and are hitting 2X as fast as anything that has ever been seen in the past. Now add to this concoction the fact that Velketor(a wizard mob with fewer hps than the other uber mobs of Velios) has 180,000+ hps. Verant made these encounters to last for LONG periods of time. The shortest I have ever seen Velketor drop in the 5 times I have seen him drop was in 10 minutes. 10 MINUTES FOR 1 SINGLE MOB, NOT A GROUP OF MOBS, BUT A SINGLE MOB. That's not counting the time it takes to get to him. Dain Frostreaver has 400,000+ hps roughly. Do the math, THINK about this for a bit. You should start to realize shortly afterwards.<P>Let's talk about Icewell Keep for a bit(my guild went giant faction so I cannot say if giants are the same, but I suspect they are). EVERY mob in Icewell Keep above the sewerline is 100 PERCENT resistant to ALL forms of resistable magic(again lures and unresistable spells do not apply as they are in effect unresistable or close to it). Turgurs? Nope, resisted EVERY TIME IT IS CAST. Mez? Nope, resisted EVERY TIME IT IS CAST. Cripple, Snare, any normal debuff? Nope, resisted EVERY TIME IT IS CAST. More to think about.<P>This is my warning to all to think before you speak. If all the clerics canceled their accounts today, ALL of us wouldn't be to far behind them. Think about it before you jump on the feeding fenzy bandwagon of the few that are uninformed or unthinking.<P>Zukaril Dreadfire &lt;The Harmonium&gt;<BR>Level 58 iksar Luminary of Xev.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Look, in the past clerics didn't have to worry about aggro when they used CH because it didn't taunt.  Now, its a big taunt, so you'll have to change your tactics.  For example, cast Celestial Healing (Or whatever that heal over time spell is) the second the tank is engaged with the mob.  Its a slow heal, so that it won't build much aggro.  It will, however, prevent the tank's health from plummeting so quickly.  If his health is dropping too fast, use the smaller heals to keep it up until the mob's health has dropped significantly.  Then, when the mob is at an acceptably low health, you can let the tank drop to 20 or 30% before you use a CH.<P>Is this method as mana efficient as only using CH?  No, and I suspect that was the point of this nerf.  I suspect that Verant thought that CH as used was unbalancing.  However, does this mean that clerics will be replaced in groups by Druids and Shammy's?  No, of course not.  CH is still the most efficient method of healing, and having it available in between fights and at the end of fights is still a big advantage.  Also, don't forget that clerics can also resurrect, and so will always be wanted in groups.<P>Darq</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Did anyone stop to think that perhaps this nerf is intended to change group dynamics entirely? In one nerf, Verant has suddenly made Druids and Shamen not just secondary healers in groups but almost essential so that one person does not have to take all the healing responsibility upon themselves. This also REALLY opens the door for Palys to get back into groups as they are Tank/Healers. Suddenly a Paly and Shaman/Druid almost become required personel for a group to work. Groups can no longer consist of 4 or more damage dealers and 1 healer to back them up. The added aggro also really helps Palys to become more viable tanks. If healing is now an Uber taunt, they can now do something to get a mobs attention while helping other group members. Will this work in the long run? Who knows. Verant is trying to shake things up a bit in order to make different classes more group friendly and group viable again. In this one nerf to Clerics, they may have made secondary healers and Palys more viable and required classes in groups. I respect that and I'm sorry for all the people who played characters which they may not have like the most in order to be viable in the later stages of the game. You had to know this was coming though as Verant couldn't let the previous dynamic which excluded half of the classes in the game go on. <P>/shrug</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well said, Zukaril.<P>I agree wholeheartedly with the original post. I too have gotten my cleric to 60th level. Last night was one of the most disheartening EQ experiences I have ever dealt with.<P>Clerics generate a decent amount of hate, always have. However, I see a group of 30 tanks beating on one mob, for say 20-30 seconds. I throw off a CH or two on my group members and I am instantly dog food. How the hell does that work? You have a huge group of people literally gangbanging a mob, and the cleric takes priority over ALL those people? Simply put, this change is crap.<P>I was oh so happy to log in last night to see my Donal's BP now creates a handy dandy buff called "Complete Heal". Boy, this just removed every use I have for the item. Back to wearing Rubicite. At least it has a worthwhile effect.  &lt;note, this is sarcasm!&gt; but again, this change is crap.<P>For all those of you who say "Clerics are a plate wearing class, they can tank!" get a clue. My AC is over 1000, but have you ever seen how fast seneschal or dain rip through 2500-3000 hp's? Instant dead cleric. Not to mention if you manage to get some of these mobs SOLO you are a god. Most of these pulls result in 2-4 mobs. ONE heal on the puller makes 3 of 4 mobs run straight for the cleric. Great, I've just wasted divine aura and if the tanks don't immediately jump right on the adds, i will also go through divine barrier. What happens if I don't get 15 minutes between pulls to let these spells refresh? Dead cleric!<P>Another misconception is the comparison of cleric agro to enchanter agro. Why would you even think of comparing the two? The cleric is casting on players who are using offensive on the mobs. Enchanters are casting DIRECTLY on the mobs. Sure, they generate a ton of agro, but thats why the cleric keeps them alive! What happens when the cleric generates just as much or more agro to MULTIPLE mobs &lt;chanters usually get one at a time, unless they use aoe stun etc&gt; Do you know anyone with good enough channeling to heal him/herself while 3 mobs are beating and bashing them for over 100? Nope, this simply does not work. Again, dead cleric.<P>Why would any high level cleric continue to play this game with these changes put into effect? You've just removed my ability to med and save lives. Isn't that what my class was designed to do? Oh, I neglected to mention earlier that even if you DON'T immediately agro a mob with a CH or Remedy, try sitting down! that is sure to do the trick. Last night in icewell keep I managed to out taunt over 20 level 60 players just by medding! Now do you still wonder why you see bitter posts by clerics, *****ing about their class!? <P>Verant, If you had half a braincell, you would reverse the changes of yesterday immediately. INCLUDING the Donal's BP. Myself and a ton of other high level clerics have had it. Some of us &lt;sad as it may be&gt; have over 1.5 years and 130+ days of time invested into this game. Do the math, that is quite a bit of money there. Without clerics, your game will not survive.<P>Also, for all of you people posting flames, or making comments, I'd say try playing the game as a level 50+ cleric sometime. You'll eat your words.<P>Zarach Lionstar &lt;The Harmonium&gt;<BR>High Priest - Xev</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok....<P><BR>We knew about the Donal's nerf for about a month, was not a big suprise. We also knew about the evade nerf for a few weeks, no big suprise. What Verant FAILED to mention was the entire change to agro system designed to bend over clerics jailhouse style.<P>Verant has made the spell "Complete Heal" the staple for high level operations in both large raids and small exp groups. Let me start with an example.<P>I am a 60th Rogue. I am a 60th Rogue with Willsapper/Ragebringer combo, pretty much highest agro in game. Last night with full buffs I was fighting a Royal Guard in Icewell. I was Complete healed by my cleric, we will just call him Deven for this experiment. Shortly after the lil guard ran away from the 10 tanks beating on him with max haste, epics, everything to proceed to beat on Deven. I flipped on duelist spamming 140-150 normal hits along with 700-800 pt backstabs repeatedly and the guard did not leave until Deven was dead 10 seconds later.<P>That is some nice coding. If you dont want any hard mobs killed Verant, just make it so Clerics cannot go into zones with blue mobs. Until then you are simply wasting my time along with everyone elses. <P>Nenja The Silent<BR>Leader of Harmonium<BR>Xev</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Look, in the past clerics didn't have to worry about aggro when they used CH because it didn't taunt. Now, its a big taunt, so you'll have to change your tactics. For example, cast Celestial Healing (Or whatever that heal over time spell is) the second the tank is engaged with the mob. &lt;&lt;&lt;<P>Not to single you out, but will all you people making this suggestion try to pay attention here.  We are talking about situations where CH is NEEDED.  If it is not NEEDED then we don't NEED to use it and we can use something else.  See how that works.<P>And for all you non-clerics and lower levels who have all the answers, we are also not talking about the level 20, 30, or 40 game, and we are not talking about sunning yourself in OOT whacking an SF now and then.  We are talking about high level encounters where use of CH is the only thing that makes the situation manageable.<P>So you folks want us to time our heals better?  No problem for us ... of course, YOU are dead.  This should work real well.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bye my cleric  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>I love being a cleric. I only play cleric since day 1. I don't have twink. My cleric has 1059 ac self buffed.<P>My group was killing in OS. Whenever I healed, I got jumped.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> Yes, no matter what kind of heals I use.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Warning to clerics:<BR>1. Don't heal someone if more than 1 on him. <BR>2. Don't heal someone if he doesn't do anything to piss the mob.<BR>3. Don't heal someone if the mob he tanking isn't almost down.<BR>4. Don't heal yourself after u got attacked.<BR>5. The better ratio heal you use, the faster your group dead cos you dead.<BR>6. Shaman and Druid heals better than cleric now. And Don't forget shaman has CAN III and druid's 60 buff has mana regen effect, free of charge and groupwide  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>7. Don't level up your cleric. Pally can 49 res or finish your epic at 50.<BR>8. Make sure your cleric never hit 60. FYI, I spend about 10k on perdiots per month.<BR>9. Words of Restoration in trak raid and hoshkar = instant death.<BR>10. Feel free to refuse res request from druids until they stop whining about how underpower they are.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060368-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060368.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060368-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/060368-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=060368&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=060368&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
