Tell me what needs balancing for bards. You may as well give me bugs and broken stuff too. But my focus is going to be on things that are needed to move bards closer to 'balanced' in the game. This may include a nerf or two, I want to warn you of that. I am just as willing to suggest a negative change that helps to achieve balance as a positive one.<P>Also, I understand that a bard is a complicated class to play. And I have no problem with that. This complicated nature will always mean that there are fewer bards in the game than other classes. I'm fine with that too.<P>Please, be detailed where you need to. Try to avoid abbreviations, my simian mind can't decipher many of them.<P>Thanks.<P>Alan<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I do not neccessarily think that all our haste songs should stack. Though I firmly believe it would in no way throw balance out of whack if it were so.<P>What I do think is that we should have types of haste songs. Ones that do stack, and ones that do not. Much as was attempted with the Ervaj songs....<BR>The main difference being that we'd like songs that stacked and were not basicaly pointless... which the Ervaj songs currently are.<BR>This for two reasons, really. One: They don't show up 'til 49 and 60. Which does no good whatsoever for all the bards wanting to group with enchanters in any prior level. Two: The amount of increase for the level is pathetic. (I could see a +5% at level 20, not at level 49.. and +10% at 60?! The horror!)<P>Basically, if Verant wants to work on bards, they should make REALISTIC efforts to simply make the songs we do have, work like they are supposed to.<BR>And don't go on a tangent about 'supposed to'. It is fairly clear, in many cases, that songs do not work in some or any situation, when they most likely should.<P> - Mana songs that actually drain mana in any significant amount. (Solves some high level raid usefullness issues)<BR> - Various Song stacking issues, that lesson our desirability when shaman are present, and almost axe it completely when an enchanter shows up.<BR> - Lullaby to actually work. Giving us at least some ability to do cc via mez at some level before 53. No, it does not have to be as good as an enchanter. But useless is a far cry from working.<BR> - Haste type instrument based songs that actually increased the haste component when instruments were used.<BR> - Damage songs that actually scaled up like every other classes ability to do damage scales. (Contrary to some oppinion, it is not a factor of us being able to apply melee and song damage at once. Adding a flat curve, to a flat curve, is still a flat curve. It just points out that neither our songs or melee damage scales comparably to anyone else.)<BR> - Reconsidering mana requirements on some songs. (Not neccessarily removing them, but changing in some ways. Desperate Dirge is pointless as is.)<P>There are many issues... remains to be seen if Verant cares to deal with them. Bards tend to get layed by the wayside, or misrepresented alot, due to lack of understanding. (The whole 'its free' issue being an example. Anyone who believes that has no business addressing the issues at all. They clearly don't get it.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, all the whining is getting out of hand.  use a logical argument to explain, among other things, why haste should stack.  you can't just throw out they should stack just because.  the best argument has come from Thott's use of power curves to explain the effectiveness of Bards, as opposed to other classes, specifically in the end game.  While other classes power rises exponentially in the end game, Bard power rises geometrically, resulting in our ineffectiveness.<P>I was recently grouped with a Chanter AND a Shaman.  What does a Bard do in this situation?  the only thing we can do, dmg, mana, and probably snare.  Is that the Vision of Bards?  Because that is what we usually end up doing.<P>50+, no one wants Bard haste, and certainly not Bard slow.  Mezzing is unreliable at best, and given the opportunity, any group would take a Chanter over a Bard.  If you want to not increase Bard crowd control ability, at least let us fill another niche.  A balanced group is much more important in the end game, and you want a group of specialists, more than a group of general abilities.  Haste stacking would give Bards a way to enhance a group, so that even if there is a Chanter, and lord knows everyone wants a Chanter, Bards are valuable to the group.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Until they fixed haste last year, all haste effects gave maximum increase in attack speed.  That didn't unbalance the game, which suggests that allowing bards the ability to stack their haste wouldn't hurt things.<P>Further, since Bard effects are better done by other classes as they get higher level, the ability to contribute and benefit a group lowers the higher level you get.  Put an enchanter and shaman in a group and you can be hard pressed to figure out what to play, the contribution has gone down significantly.<P>If it is Verant's intent for Bards to be group contributers and help every group out wonderfully like they do at lower levels, then stacking ALL songs is a logical choice. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>  Nothing wrong with the low level mana song... should probably have been added when breeze was.  One the other hand, I agree... it does nothing to fix the problems bards have; 20-30 are not the levels where bards need balance work.<P>1.) Song/Spell stacking issues<P> I am personally against general haste stacking... I would like to see bards as useful as an enchanter (if in somewhat a different way)... not just useful as a sidekick to the enchanter. <P>On a related issue, Ervaj should be changed to singing... would 5% more haste be better than 10 strength and the regen effect from niv's?  Better than a stackable 9 pt damage shield, plus resistance?  Do more than chanting, which makes caster spells able to hit harder?  In some cases yes... in other no.  More flexible, but not really more powerful; which kind of describes bards.  Its hard to win big by adding a bard, but we make everything run just a bit smoother.<P>2.) Offense issues<BR>I don't think bards need to be improved much in this area IF we have other things to offer a party.... see (3)<P>3.) A increse in Song power scaleing <BR>over the levels, relative to other classes.<P>This is the big one.  Bard songs should get step increases at certain levels to keep the relative power level the same.<P>4.) Twisting/repetitive motion solutions<P>How about changing Catana to (a) be as good as the mana song AND the healing song AND jig, and (b) not allow it to be twisted with any of those songs.  (It should still *stack* with the mana song from another bard)?<P>How about an untwistable song that is the healing from the Heal song... plus Niv's.<P>The idea is to not make songs that add *new* abilties... just add songs that can be used instead of twisting a couple older ones.<P><BR>5.) Possable Charm line "changes" in favor <BR>of much better group enhancing songs.<P>Kind of capped low at (51?) anyway... and drain mana... not too much room left to nerf these and still be useful.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The biggest reason that haste should stack is the opportunity cost of a bard vs any other melee class. Take your normal group of 3 melees and 3 non-melees. Fundamentally, adding a bard, supposedly the best group class, to a group should cause them to get better. Currently this is not the case. Damage output goes down. In a group with 3 melee, substituting one for a bard will cause a %20 drop in damage output. Substituting a non-melee may give you a slight raise is melee damage, but any other class can do more damage than a bard, over time. pets/dots/nukes, everything. <P> In my opinion, adding a bard to a balanced 5 man group, should be better than adding any other class. That's what we live for, groups. As it stands just about any other class, well played, is more useful than the best played bard.<P> Yes, this assumes you have an enchanter in the group. Who the hell cares if you don't. We're talking about class balance here. Being able to contribute in unbalanced groups that suck is not something which draws me back to the class.<P> Please Please Please at least give us an acknowledgement that you understand there is a problem with bards when there is an enchanter around. Even if you then say, 'well we can't fix it cause that would mess up the game balance.' At least we'd know that you had a clue enough to realize there was a problem. One that we've been pointing out for 2+ years now.<P>Creed<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Many people more technically oriented than I have posted, well covering many issues<BR>I agree with.  My strongest agreements are with haste/slow stacking, resists, and<BR>picking whether we're defensive or offensive, and adjusting our skills more in line<BR>with that idea.<P>I have only a couple of things I'd like to address in detail.<P>&gt;"3. Song instance creation at the same point that old instance fades erases both old and<BR>new instance of the song. Very very annoying when you're selo's cuts out while kiting a<BR>mob."&lt; <P>(Absor)I consider this a very minor bug. It can't be very common. But I'll add it to the list.<P>This is nowhere near minor or uncommon.  In my experience, it's extremely common, to the point<BR>of every day occurance.<P>I would also like to mention that I believe I've seen the same thing happen with my 30 druid.<BR>I have, 6 times that I recognized in that char's past, casted SoW at the moment the previous<BR>spell wore off.  I did not mistarget, I did not fizzle and not notice.  It simply didn't renew.<P>Granted, compared to the amount of times I cast SoW, and how many that's happened, it's exceptionally<BR>low.  However, it does exists, and in the bard class, is much more prevalent because each song<BR>start is equivalent to renewing a spell.<P>&gt;"- Casting animation on bard songs. We are bards, we play our instruments...we don't cast spells.<BR>I should not be swinging my arms over my head while playing my Chant series or while playing Niv's<BR>Melody of Preservation."&lt; <P>(Absor) But aren't bards supposed to look silly?<P>I think you addressed this later, but I'd like to stress it.  We are singing, not casting.  I don't<BR>feel we should be making casting movements.  As well, while holding an instrument, it seems inconsistent<BR>to me not to show it being played as opposed to random arm swinging that does not relate to our class.<P>I'd like to make an addition to other's arguments regarding snare/root, etc.<P>I was distressed the other day, to notice our Enchanter had root.  This does not seem consistent<BR>with class-related abilities.  What is an Enchanter - master of illusion and mind control - doing<BR>with a complete-stop, long lasting, renewable root?  Mes/charm are mental limitations, root is a<BR>physical action - the mob is aware and its own mentality is functioning.  This is a great disparity,<BR>in my opinion.<P>My last issue, is regarding effects on our armor.<P>Balance, in my opinion, is not just numbers, or even how we compare to other classes.

</FONT><HR>&gt; In my opinion, adding a bard to a balanced 5 <BR>&gt; man group, should be better than adding any <BR>&gt; other class. That's what we live for, groups. <BR>&gt; As it stands just about any other class, well <BR>&gt; played, is more useful than the best played <BR>&gt; bard.<P>&gt; Yes, this assumes you have an enchanter in the <BR>&gt; group. Who the hell cares if you don't. We're <BR>&gt; talking about class balance here. Being able to <BR>&gt; contribute in unbalanced groups that suck is <BR>&gt; not something which draws me back to the class.<P>  I think your point is absolutely correct... just the conclusion is wrong.  If an otherwise balanced 5-man group wanted to add another member, there should be compelling reasons that the bard should be added in some situations, an enchanter in others, a shaman in still others, a warrior in some, a rogue in some, a wizard in still more.<P>  I don't ask that a 5 man group always grab a bard, just that a bard be as valuable as any other member they might grab:  the best in some situations, not the best in others.  If all of those situations that bards would be best to add start with: "assume a enchanter is already present...", then its not very balanced.<P>  I feel like the general haste stacking is just copping out.  There *is* an opportunity cost to adding a bard...   just like a necro whose role is to twitch the enchanter... you are probably better with a second enchanter; necro's are valuable to groups because they bring lots of other things (like heap loads of damage) AND they are still useful in less ideal parties and big raids.  There are situations where necro's are just better than enchanters... the same should be true of bards.<P>This opportunity cost should be resolved by saying:<BR>"50% of groups should benefit more by adding a bard than by adding an enchanter"<P>rather than saying: <BR>"We realize chanters are required... bards are balanced because they are useful given this constraint."<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>With regards to the new changes from Test.<P>A level 20 mana song is unballancing: The early level songs were already very well balanced. The bard at lower levels is not a bad fighter, making him useful in caster-based groups just on the merrit of his mele skills and songs like healing. At these levels, enchanters are not yet quite the masters of mez, and the level 16 breeze went a long way towards balancing them back in to a slot the bard had stolen from the. This balance is why we were told that the bard's lullaby had to be adjusted. Obviously this is no-longer the official stance, and perhaps lullaby finally deserves a review. It never was as good as having an enchanter.<P>A lot of the bards have professed to having difficulty obtaining class items, and disputed the values of those items.<P>Instead of seriously investigating this, you simply give us warrior like defense? The problem with this is that it is ill considered given the numerous defensive songs that a bard has available to them. Bards are soft and squishy and create lots of agro. This is the baseline challenge of the class. What justification is there for increasing our defensive capabilities?<P>From a role-play perspective, the bard is a proud fellow who hides behind masks. In battle he may be quite a tough nut to crack when he is fully garbed and in full voice. But catch him raw and he is quite without capabilities.<P>K</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Could you consider either adding a target based mana drain to the mid 40's low 50's, moving the high 50's mana drain down and changing it, or changing our level 35 mana drain song to work differently?<P>I'm thinking it would be nice if we got something like this:<P>Some Bard Drain Song<BR>type: target based<BR>duration: 3 ticks<BR>effect: drains 125 mana from the target and simultaneously gives an equivelant amount of mana to all the party as the level 34 cantana of soothing (roughly 3-4 per tick), except it would be immediate injection of mana to party members ala level 32 chorus of clarity.<P>This song would drain a fair amount of mana from the target, give 1/3 the mana that chorus of clarity would give to the party, only be target based, would stop me from using any other songs if I wanted to drain an effective amount of mana, and if you make it instrument only you would either need the epic weapon or would not be able to melee.<P>-Desbarolis -- 47th bard<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I wanted to throw my own two cents in on this, especially since most of the comments here seem to focus on the high end game and less on stuff below 40 to 45. My bard isn't 40 yet and issues for her are different, and fit into a few broad categories.  I think one of the core balancing issues is how our songs seem to be valued for balancing.  <P>First at all levels we seem to be evaluated as a partial tank, well depending on who you ask we are a pure caster after some level in the high 20s or 30s doing very little tanking because we have this massive aggro rate and pure caster level hp, and both weak combat defense and offense.  At some point our songs must be powerful enough to compete with pure casters for effectiveness because we are effectively casters that stop tanking later than other casters, or we must have our combat skills increased in some way to make it realistic that we are a secondary tank.  <P>Second, we get a huge penalty in our song effectiveness relative to other hybrids because they are mostly manaless (with Dirge costing so much mana that nobody uses it, and I don't intend to buy it when I get to that level if it doesn't change).  Although this is nice and it has a side effect that we can cast while moving this seems to be quite overvalued. To balance this our songs are weaker, much more easily resisted and shorter duration.  In just about every case except running with our drums our songs are the weakest of their type when compared to even a much lower level caster of the parent class of that type of spell.<P>One reason that this is the case I think is because the fact that our songs are manaless is seen as a bonus without any downside.  Our songs should be evaluated not as "free" but as having a different opportunity cost.  That is how much effect can our songs have over time vs. a caster taking into account caster downtime for medding.  This should also take into account the level of the song/singer (a little intricate since our songs are better as we level, but at a rate that doesn't keep up with other increases in abilities for other classes) vs. level of spell/caster. I think the major reason that our songs are so much weaker than caster class spells in most cases, is they are overvalued because of being mana-free and not seen as each song being a third to a half  of our total casting ability at any time.  Because other classes can med back mana for their buffs in much less than the time they last, they are usually worth much less than anything close to a third of their casting balance.  Also mana casters can give (or in the case of clarity and SOW) sell their spells to people not in their group, and the effect of the spells continue for some time whether they are still in their group, stunned,  far away or dead, this is not true of the Bard. This also means a caster can cast a buff and free up a spell slot to mem another, having more variety of spells available over time. And lastly mana casters can split their spells between only those who need them. Our songs effect everyone in the group who is in range, which is great, except we are rarely in a group where everyone is helped by any given song, so unlike a caster we are effectively casting spells on party members that don't benefit or benefit very little. I think our songs are balanced assuming every member of the party is benefitting from our buffs all the time, and in fact this is rarely true. It is a weak group that is all casters to benefit from our mana songs,  and it is rarely the case that all of the members of our party need hp regen. Considering the cost-over-time of songs versus spells, the only real benefits of being manaless are that we can always sing songs (except for charm {because dirge is useless}we never are oom), and cast songs when moving. Over time the effectiveness of these songs is much less than that for a pure or hybrid caster of the same level, and sometimes lower level.<P>The other part of the miscalculation is based on aggro.  I am the queen of aggro.  I have been in a number of parties with two characters with taunt and a rogue backtabbing, and I am the target for the mob or mobs.  I understand that it used to be worse, it is still way ahead of any other class.  I think this is partly true because it seems like a lot of our songs are evaluated for aggro based on their potential effect instead of actual.  So for example our healing song seems to aggro as if I am healing every party member, even if only one of them is injured.  For our buffs and debuffs we are hit a for aggro in a way that no other class is.  Mobs don't get pissed at any other class for buffing party members because they buff in down time, and/or one party member at a time.  We get hit with agro for buffing, and that haste component falling on the cleric sitting medding to heal counts.  And unlike any other caster we need to be close in to the fight to have our buffs, and debuffs work, making it much easier for the mobs to hit us.  We don't have significantly more HP than those casters who get to sit back further from the fight.  They aren't immune to aggro, but tend to be in much better shape than us, by being further from the fight. <P>So how to balance.  I have a few suggestions.  I envision the bard as a class that never gives up melee the same as hybrids, and therefore I am discussing modifications that would balance them in that direction. I use the fact that we get a sword that functions as all insruments as evidence that you expect us to keep fighting, otherwise an all type insturment with bigger bonuses would have made more sense. I know others see us as becoming that pure caster type at some point.  If it is really your vision that we become pure casters, than increase the power of our songs, duration of songs, lower resists, and give us target AE damage and debuff songs that we can use against groups of mobs from the caster area, instead of in the melee. <P>We are part rogue, some people have suggested raising the caps on our pick locks and disarm traps,  I don't care about these skills as much as the skill evade.  I think evade is the one rogue skill that makes the most sense for our class.  We are nimble fast fighters and our songs are more than competitive with backstab for aggro. I can't count the number of times I've been in a group, the mob is on me, the rogue backstabs,  the mob turns looks at rogue long enough to tell him s/he is rude and comes back to pound on me. Evade along with raising our other defense skills (including parry and riposte) is the one thing that would really help, and seems to me to to fit well with our nature. <P>Songs that use mana should have longer duration than our normal songs, maybe not as long as pure casters, but there needs to be a balance that takes into account that Bard mana is rarer stuff, because we take so long to regen,  but isn't the same as caster mana because it doesn't eliminate our ability to sing any song, just songs that use mana.  Currently this would not effect any songs but the lvl 39 charm, and that one only if you raised the mana cost, but I think charging 80 mana and letting it last a minute would make a lot of bards happy.  Maybe a mana option that allows me to cast a song on somebody and they keep it for a while, as a higher level skill<P>Whatever your vision for bards more of our songs should stack both with each other and with caster magic.  This has the most impact with haste, but there are lots of cases. Other classes can cast cast AC buffs that stack but we can't. This would even help every so often in the marginal case of Selo's stacking with SOW so party members can run at bard speed when Selo's is up and default back to SOW if I die.  Many a party member of mine would have lived with that little extra burst of speed.  As it is, if we have somebody in the party that can cast SOW we will always be sure to keep that on everyone for escape (haven't been to the planes yet).  I might die, or get separated from the party so Selo's is too unreliable.  <P>We need more weapons that double as insturments.  Denons Dagger of drumming,  Selo's sword of singing etc.  At least one for each intrument type along with a singing focus.  This is sort of obvious as a step to our epic weapon. Probably one for the 30s and upgrades in the 40s. <P>Aesthetics. Along with the no waddle running and our drums shouldn't look like flutes, our higher level instruments should look special. I have a machine that can handle our particle effects, but they should be toned down. Our icons shouldn't blink, and any song that has duration should get an icon. My bard wouldn't forget she is singing an AE damage song, so give me an icon so I don't forget and aggro a guard. I haven't done it in a long time,  but I need something visual.  I'm more likely to have miskeyed the song. A visual remider would be good.<P>And no matter what find a way to eliminate carpal tunnel.  I like the idea of 3 or 4 songs being active, and we need to turn one off to start another,  but that would be weird for songs like Bellow that don't continue, or charm that you want to target differently.<P>I enjoy my bard over my shaman, magician, wizard or monk, because she is much more challenging to play, but I want a challenge that I can meet to be just as effective as other classes, not matter the size or composition of my group.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here is a different perspective.<P>I play an Enchanter, and I can tell you I dread grouping with a Bard.  To be short and to the point, they get in my way.  I give my group Clarity and Haste spells, but the Bard want to use their songs and waste time.  The bard wants to use short duration charm or mesmerisation to 'help out' and ruins my well set up mezz's.<P>I would like to see Bards more Enchanter compatible, thank you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Look, I haven't used the test server, si I don't have ALL the info, but something was said to me in game today that REALLY pissed me off. After ALL the talk on these boards about balancing the bard class, the FIRST thing i hear when i log on is... "bards get a lvl 20 mana song on test.  When is it going live???" I DON'T MEAN TO SHOUT BUT WHO ACTUALLY ASKED FOR A LVL 20 MANA SONG? A wizard? Necro?  Who? Who did it?  I'm just so P.O.ed that THIS is what we get?  I would rather not get an alternate lvl 20 song and i am only lvl 22!  And this is my main.  I don't have any problem getting into groups at this point so why not use precious changes to do something to help BARDS.  As I see it, this some helps everyone BUT the bard.  THANKS.  Really, thanks.  i thought I just had to look forward to being a mana battery til i turned 32, and now I can be prepared to experiance this sooner. Tell ya' what.  If THIS goes live and none of the other issues that have been brought up in the bard talks are touched, well, maybe i'll just hang up the lambent. WAIT!  I'm not even big enough yet to do the lambent quests...

</FONT><HR>-Our defense should be increased through our skills in Defense, and Dodge, and higher AC items.<P>-Our offense should be increased through our songs.  While all other classes have increased in offensive power, the bard is static. I do not desire double attack, that would be pointless, and just make us a different type of ranger.<P>-Due to the short duration of our songs, all of our songs should stack with cast spells. <P>-The inability of our songs to stack with other class's spells is the primary reason that we are not desired in the post 50 groups. We do not bring anything to a group that isn't done much better by another class.<P>-Enchanter mesmerize line of spells should overwrite our mesmerization songs.<P>-Mana usage needs to be relooked at, The power of our mana use songs are pre-Kunark, and post 50 are useless.<P>-Finally, the level caps on charms need to be removed. Enchanter and bards. Post 50 charms are purely traffic control, and post 50 charms are practically useless now, except in very rare circumstances.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think haste and almost all, well in fact our songs should stack with any other spells in the group. Bards are built for grouping, if you have songs that don't stack you're making players to then choose which do they prefer? Bard song power or the same spell from a spellcaster? Usually too the spell is stronger than the song eg haste songs. You take away the stacking you make them less group friendly.<P>The mana song at level 20 gives bards an early boost in groups, since they run into a lil bump on the way to 32. They have to start grouping at 18+ until they receive their fear and charm songs late 20's, when they can go back to soloing if they wanted, even if its more of a pain than grouping.<P>-Fix haste songs to stack with other hastes, Most of the bards battle songs have haste!<BR>-Give Desperate Dirge another look and see if mana requirement can be dropped or some sort of recast time inserted instead of using mana.<BR>-Raise med caps to Improve meming spells<BR>-Set longer durations for Snare songs<BR>-Move level 32 mana song to 20 and have cantana  as the new mana song for level 34, to spread the levels when we get them.<BR>-Look into possibly increasing the damage on some of our dots.<BR>-Look into scripting twisting into socials in the hotkey slots<BR>There's only five lines available in the socials button, so something like this should be made..<P>~Hotkey 1~<BR>/cast 1 <BR>/pause 30 /cast 2 /cast 2 <BR>/pause 30 /cast 3 /cast 3 <BR>/pause 30 /cast 4 (turns off last song)<BR>/hotkey 2 (would then play hotkey social button 2)<P>~Hotkey 2~<BR>/cast 4 <BR>/pause 30 /cast 5 /cast 5 <BR>/pause 30 /cast 6 /cast 6 <BR>/pause 30 /cast 1 (turns off last song)<BR>/hotkey 1 (would then play hotkey social button 1)<P>Someone pointed out to me a command /stopsong<BR>not sure if thats even a real command as I couldn't get it to work.<BR>But they had something along the lines of this<BR>/cast 1<BR>/pause 5, /stopsong<BR>/cast 2<BR>/pause 5, /stopsong<BR>/cast 3<P>Does that actually work? if not can something along the lines of what I mentioned be implemented?<P>thanxs</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi absor and poor bardish friends :P<P>Anyone else noticed the new download file as of Wednesday 31 and there was a new one not long ago.<P>the gequip file is the Graphic file mainly, for items and etc.<P>ABSOR tell me our drum is in there, i already seen some new goggles tinkering gnomes can make. Please dont tell me you have implement this as a bigger priority than fixing my roleplay experience as a bard? I dont like swinging my arms in the air having a flute in my hand while its suppose to be a drum. or stringing a flute while its supposed to be a drum.<P>I got a idea for a bard primary only sword.<BR>this could be applyed to other class as well…for new items.<P>I tought about a sword (dancing blade for example) to have a gem slot in it.<BR>You could put this sword in the hotkey and drag a spell in it.<BR>when rightclicking the sword ( song would still have same effect and same casting time)<BR>Would be mainly like a Breath of harmony but you could drag any of your songs in it.<BR>So it could be a weapon and have Would make like a 9th Slot.<BR>You would need to have weapon equipped for this to work etc.<BR>Think it could be a neat creative idea.<BR>(tought would be too much to ask maybe for coding even if it wouldnt be too far of the Breath of harmony coding)<P><BR>Also id like to tell verant that even if your songs on paper might look neat you need to put them in a context to really test them out. <P>For example in a standard group in general you got 2 tank max. post 50…<P>Our songs effect the whole group. But why would a wizard care if i sing HAste song or not …….<P>or cleric,shm,nec,dru,ench(they just told us to stop because our sucks),mage.<P>Haste is for the melees(and post 50 you never have more than 2 in the group in about 99% of the time)<P>Sur our song a free and continuous for most of them. But you have to keep in mind that we cannot have more than 3 of them up at once, 4-5 with a breath of harmony and perfect timing maybe.<P>Its not like a shaman who takes 1 min to buff his whole group and med for 5 mins. Then he doesnt have to buff for 1 hour. and can do dots, dd,slows etc.<P>In the evolution of Everquest, all buffs last longer now they are better. Also casters dont need us as much now to keep them up with mana since they dont have to buff that often now. Our songs on the other side scale up Very SLOWLY to an unefficient level post 50.<P>Even some stop scaling up at all.<BR>Lot of our songs capping 51-53 like fear charm mez(55).----means bard cannot do any mob control on 55+ mobs(thats fine thats the enchanter job, then gives us something else to do…not just being a mana battery)<P>Mana sieving not working at all. would take ages to drain a normal mob completely or significately and on the hard ones(it just get resisted even after malosini and occlusion of sound and im level 60).<P>And the equipment and other spells is WAY better than it was at 50(would be ok if it was proportional but its not, at least to our songs). it just didnt go up by 12,5% or so it nearly doubled in the ammount of stats, resists, Effects(btw our need to looked into, i already posted about this), AC,HP,disciplines.<P>What does this means?<BR>bard hastea nd his other songs vs the Major increase other classes gets as they level because they keep getting new  spells in their lines of spells, who increase by a lot so the bard is less efficient as he levels vs the other classes<P>for haste….Anyway enchanters beat the hell out of this there.(make it stack)…its ok their have better haste but then we cannot use our when they are around. and you always need an enchanter in uber raids or 55+ places.<P>I wont even make a comparaison for speed, enchanter beat us by 40%. <P>Since haste doesnt Stack. this means when an enchanter is in the group, bard have no use to sing his haste songs.<P><BR>Bard slow down efficient( our best slow at 60 equal to a level 29 shaman slow-tagar's insect)<BR>Enchanter get a best slow than us at level 24 (tepid deeds, its 32% at level 24 and scale to 50% at level 60)<BR>Our best slow down is Largos absonant binding at 51(35% at level 60).<P>Since bard slow is about 2 and half x slower and we get it 30 levels later theres no use to the bard singing a slow down song because it doesnt stack.<P>How many of our songs turn around speed and slow down songs? LOTS, WE dont want a higher speed song than enchanters. We only want our song to stack so we are useful when they are around. same for slow down with shamans.<P>With slow downs and haste songs and i excluded the stats only buffing songs. i came up with 15 useless songs when enchanters or shaman is there.  How many songs does a bard have? around 73<P>Means 21% of our songs are useless when we are with a enchanter or shaman or both.<P>what does this leave us with?<P>the mob control songs….oh wait theres an enchanter go away stupid bard..(thats normal in my mind just showing what is left to do)<BR>damage shields( bugged for psalm …..gives ultravision but it song wears off even if u got infravision class based you will be like a human…not sure if still bugged havent used it in a while)<P>Leaves us really with mana song line and few other cool ones like see invis song( woot) and random tp song if you get tired of your group and feel like throwing them in a lava pit or drowning your friends in cobalt scar. hehe<P><BR>(btw psalm of purity and psalm of vitality doesnt cure disease and poison anymore, please make it get off 1 poison counter or disease counter like before…fun when a level 60 bard cannot cure himself with this song, he can get 70 resist off this but cannot cure rabies which can be given by a level 10 mummy, woot go SUPER BARD VERSATILITY!!!)<P>stats buffs……as i said equipment is way better than it was so are buffs….stats often capped.<BR>resists……same as equipment with all buffs potions and new resist stuff. we arent much of use there.<BR>Travel songs endure breathing etc…endure breath items, sow and so on. off course we faster but it doesnt worth traveling with a bard. he has to stop everytime because you loose item. LD with travel song can result in deaths 10k falls. Player just prefer to use sow Most of the time.<P>Our songs make others lagged. the bug that needs to get the hotkey spammed when ur song just wont stop singing is getting people spammed. even if they have bard songs on. They still get the info it just doesnt show…makes their lag goes up.<P>The rune songs and Ervaj song are really spammy and make everyone lags…it comes with a damn noisy sound getting on nerves.<P>I am still making my arm going crazy like in the air on a lot of songs when im using an instrument. tuyens chant of flame,tuyens chant of frost and lot more(drum songs).<P>Btw thanks absor for increasing our defense(sarcastic…. : P), it doesnt do anything post 50 anyway…With our stupid damage only our taunting songs will make the mobs hit us in raids or uber group. Or if a player (melee or other hybrid) level 55 is equipped like a level 35 and we can do more dmg than him.<P>Please remember absor bards were made to make their power increase as they level since the songs power were groing, lots stopped at 50. and from 51 to 60 not much increased significantly vs the other classes increases were getting.<BR>from level 50 to 60…all classes were about 2x stronger while bard song increase got a 5-12% increase perhaps…..all other classes duration spells increase, power increases, better stats, faster casting time and so on.<P>While bards remains with 3 sec casting time evoluting in harder zones with low increasing curves songs power.<BR> being tagged alone for their friends they met before 50.<P>As for occlusion of sound. make the duration last longer please. Its way too low for such spell malo spell. magi and shaman have a Huge duration on theirs. I would like to see occlusion of sound getting 1 min duration a little like anglistich assonance. So we wouldnt have to keep singing it on all mobs. If we wanna malo 3 mobs for example. we cannot do anything else than to malo them( occlusion of sound) because …song requires a drum. cant really hit( well hand to hand but it doesnt do much really for a bard).<P>Also if i put occlusion of sound on a mob then a shaman malo it will stack BUT when my song wears off, his malo will wears off as well.

</FONT><HR>Well my primary characters is a cleric (now 56).  I started a bard after about 5 months after release to play on the side as an alt.  Mostly I soloed.  The short downtime was great and I had a lot of fun when I needed a break.  My bard is 46 now.<P>I've been in groups where the difference between us all dying and pulling it off has been the bard singing mana song so I would have mana to heal people.  From all the songs I have at 46, I have a hard time finding anything more effective for a well balanced group.  As soon as an enchanter shows up, I try to have them haste since it's better anyway, the extra mana they get from the song should more than make up for it.  Manasong and snare is about all I end up doing then.  I figure the extra mana lets the casters nuke more or otherwise reduce downtime much more than if I played dots.  I guess once I get the new slow song it will be a different story.  The level 34 mana/regen/jig song is nice, but the instrument requirement makes it hard to twist in.<P>And as others say, I can't really stand twisting for more than a few hours.  I like the idea of more combo songs.  It would be nicer to just put something in client side to somehow auto-twist.<P>From the number of mana drain songs in game going to bards, you'd think bards where intended to be masters of stealing mana.  As it is now, enchanters are better at this.  IMO, enchanters are masters of enough other things (mana regen, haste, crowd control), perhaps upping these songs to make bards masters of draining mana would be an apropriate specialist niche.<P>As it is now bards seem to be masters of running, resists, and maybe flexibility.  Perhaps that is enough.<P>One thing to fix, please make clarity 2 stack with the 55 catana.  As it is now, the enchanter gets annoyed having to ask the bard to drop the song to give everyone clarity.<P>Either give bards a higher or equal haste % song than enchanters or put in more stacking haste songs (~5-10%).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, here's another way to look at the bard song stacking issue.<P>Like it or not, most groups in the lvl 50+ range include an enchanter.<P>We can debate all day long whether or not an enchanter is NEEDED for most groups lvl 50+ and it won't change the fact that the perception is such. <P>Bards most coveted abilities overlap with enchanter abilities.  Enchanters do them better.  Enchanters charm better, mezz better, haste better, slow better.  The ONLY thing a bard does better is mana regen. <P>Bard haste songs, slow songs and mezz songs don't stack w/ enchanter spells.  Bards don't charm when an enchanter is mezzing mobs.  That means that if an enchanter is present, bards are relegated to playing the mana song.<P>A bard doing nothing but playing the mana song is not very usefull to the party and not very fun for the bard.<P>Put in more simple terms:<BR>1. Most groups lvl 50+ won't hunt w/out a chanter.<BR>2. Bards group very poorly with enchanters because of song stacking issues.<BR>3. Most groups lvl 50+ therefore do not need or want a bard.<P><BR>There are two solutions:<BR>1. Give bards more crowd control abilities so that we are an acceptable substitute for an enchanter.  We don't need to be as good as an enchanter... But we should be able to fill in if a group doesn't have an enchanter.<BR>2. Make enchanters and bards better able to work in one group together.  The best way to do this is to fix the song stacking issue.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I would like to point out that the major lacking points of our classes have already been expressed by most posts.<P>1. Not enough to do with enchanters(because of stacking issues.)<BR>2. The stackable speeds need to be increased to make them worth using ... 5-10% is a sadly lacking considering what is available in 'haste' resources at those levels.<P><BR>I would like to also say that the defensive skill cap increases are un-needed.  As a level 59 Bard I 'tank' better than well equipped rangers, shamans and rogues, reasonable equipped monks, and not as well as Paladins, SKs, and Warriors. <P>More importantly, in NORMAL situations I aggro mobs during melee MUCH LESS than ANY of the above (with the possible exceptions of rogues using their evade).<BR>Secondly, additional defensive skills would further blur the line between our abilities and enchanters.  I already have an ac averaging over 400 points higher than the average enchanter, not to mention reasonable dodge, parry, riposte skills to add.  Lastly, I can RUN and mesmerize thanks.<P>I would like to point out that our melee abilities are quite lacking, from a damage outpost standpoint.  I would suggest removing the defensive component of your proposed change and <BR>consider adding a melee offensive component.  <P>A low powered skill of dual wield would be a welcome and sorely needed component to the bard aresenal.  At the moment bards get weapons kills and attack/defense that cap at 235? (correct me if I'm wrong).  Dual wield caps at 155? also.  I would recommend a double attack ability capping at 100 or so, to round out our classes ability to provide as a secondary damage source.   I don't think double attack should be seen prior to level 45 though.<P>Lastly, and although it may be inappropriate here, many skills for classes appear at level 51 or 50, instead of level 40 or so.  This was primarily done because of the addition of Kunark... and how gameplay was supposed to be affected by people buying the supplement.  Could some review of when classes get skills be done to provide more gradual increases?<P>Thankyou for your time Reading this,<BR>Resso Judicata<BR>Level 59 Bard<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm not even going to address the song stacking issue - if Verant can't see that is our primary concern by now there is nothing one more post will do to sway them.<P>However the mana-drain issue hasn't been beaten into the ground yet, and since it appears Absor is fond of making the classes unique and adhere to some type of class definition this could be the ideal niche for the bard.  After all, our songs (for the most part) don't use mana, why shouldn't we scorn others' dependance on it and drain it when the opportunity presents?  <P>To further explore this possibilty, perhaps since we get none of the benefits of med or clarity we could SING to replace the mana we lose from dirge or being rezzed by 'stealing' it from a MOB (after all, we are kin to rogues)  This would change Dirge from being the song you use once to see how it works and never touching again to a possible damage-dealing option.<P>Obviously below the stacking issues as a priority, but it would definitely give us a unique value on high-level encounters since for the frequently the enchanters are far too busy mezzing/charming to use their drains with high effectiveness.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just a quick observation... I don't take issue with our current melee abilities. They're definitely not strong enough to base a career on, but enough to let us strap on the weapons every once in a while when it makes sense.<P>I'd rather see our damage, enhancements, and "debuffs" from songs increase at a commensurate rate with the level increases for other classes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Not sure if I posted this but:<P>1. Need a save like magic users versus getting hit so their songs aren't disrupted.  Caster get channeling<P>2. Need to buff their crowd control songs back up to near equal to Enchanters. This is one of their specialties.<P>3. Let Ogres/trolls be bards.
