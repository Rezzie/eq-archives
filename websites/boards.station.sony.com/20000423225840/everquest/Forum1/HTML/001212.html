</FONT><HR>***There is a big security hole in Verant's support, My Everquest account got hacked 3 times and password got changed by the hackers. I have to phone them 3 times in order to get my password reset. At the second time, the one who answered the hotline support just asked my Station Name and then reset the password and told me without confirm any other information. That means everyone have a chance to guess a Station Name and phone the hotline, then you may get a chance to use and have all items on that account. ****<P>And each time I've tried to get support from Verant, each time I've got disappointed.<P>1. First time I sent email about the login problem, they asked information for Sound Card and other hardware config.<P>2. Second time got hacked, lost many high end items and some characters got killed since EXP lost. I email the problem and they replied they've reset my password throught email, but I've found the password DID NOT work, damn. Then I have to pay long distance call telephone fee again since I am lived far from USA. After wait a long time and finally got a supporter answered me. He just asked my Station Name, then reset the password and told me WITHOUT verifying other information.<P>3. Third time I've count totally I have to wait more than 30 minutes in order to get an answer from the hotline support. And finally got my password. After I make sure I've lost some items again and my character got moved. I've did a petition and wait for the turtose-speed reponse from GM (I've sent a direct tell to the online Guides but they said they couldnt handle this case and asked me to wait and wait), I've collected some information from friends since one saw my character online during the period my account got hacked. And also a tell from a player WuXXXX (finally I know he helped my character *** used by the hacked *** tansfered items to another player,  WuXXXX seems just kind to help a player as he dont know that the character is playing by a hacker). I told these information to the Guide, but they still asked me wait and wait. Althought my friend and WuXXXX have helped my did a petition. <P>After wait around more than 2 hours, I've got some reply from a Guide and they said they've told a GM, but the GM is VERY busy and they will get back to me later again.<P>a bit later, I've got a message read like "Someone is trying to use your account, Cheaters information logged" (something like this, since I didnt keep log and just from my memory). I tried give a tell to online Guide but the /tell didnt show any message in my window, I've repeatly typed it again and again. There's still not response. Afterward, I typed "/quit" and try to relog and check my password which was changed to very Complex including both character and digit. I've found my password got changed again. Then I login my sister's Everquest account asap and found that SOMEONE was using my level 50 character, I've sent her a tell, but he seems Linkdead as it was shown in my "/who MY_LEVEL_50_Character_NAME". Later I check she back again, then I sent a direct tell to the Guide who have handle my case before, but damn he asked me to WAIT and WAIT. I asked the one who used my own account "who're u ?". The hacked log-off not long. And later I checked he used my other character. I've told the Guide and other online Guides again, but again they just ask me to WAIT.<P>Damn, that is the way Verant can do with a poor customer and that is the help they can provide to customers. Every time you sent an email to accounts@station.sony.com, you will get a response that they will handle it within 48 hours, but it fail. And the online GM/Guides will just asked players to WAIT and WAIT/WAIT/WAIT even you've got SERIOUS problems.<P>I will quit my Everquest after got my password and stopped the payments. I am afraid the hackers/illegal user can even get the credit card infomation from the poor Sercutiy inside Verant since I've scanned my hard disk using the latest Virus Scanner, it reported NO Virus found.<P>As a poor customer to the EverWaiting Game and just with the poor customer support, the only thing I can do is to quit the game.<P>Good luck to all. hope that won't happen to you, else you have to bear the ****GREAT **** support from EverWait game.<P>***There is a big security hole in Verant's support, My Everquest account got hacked 3 times and password got changed by the hackers.
