</FONT><HR>Getting back to the issue of items to increase the power of casters… I'm pretty sure there is pre-existing code architecture in place to allow for some of these suggestions. Well, I know for a fact that Clarity can be attached to any item, just as haste is(funny how both of those come from an Enchanter, but only Clarity was targeted as being that classes "bread and butter" in a group, thus we[casters] can't get an item with it).<P>I'm also pretty sure that items could be added to the game to make existing spells more powerful, via the exact method that certain items affect Bard song. If a drum from Lord Nagafen increases the speed of Selo's by 20% over a Mistmoore drum, then I think that same coding could be applied to an item that would increase the damage of a spell by 20%, it only makes sense. Giving melee classes percentage(almost exponential) increases in power while casters get a few more hit points or mana is just stupid.<P>Thought of the day: Are we[casters] being scaled to a lesser extent due to the PvP side of the game?<P>This came to me as I was sitting on my ass, like I do every night as a Cleric, in the depths of Sleepers Tomb(thx NERF btw!). Are my spells, items and abilities being affected in anyway by the PvP side of the game? Lets look at the facts… It really doesn’t matter how much Haste, Strength, AC or whatever you give to a melee on the PvP servers. He still has to catch anyone he wants to PK and chase them around long enough to beat them to a pulp. Casters, on the other hand, can take up a tactical position and snipe people from max range so we have to keep them in check. Is that why Wizards haven't been given 1500-2000 point Lures to compete in the Velious game(realize that a 1500-2000 point Lure is very close to a one-shot kill on a PvP server)? Is that why Necros don't have 1200 point taps, why Mages don't have bigger damage shields or stronger pets, etc…? Are casters doomed to a life of suck because of grieffers?<P>Let me just state, for the record that the EQ PvP system completely and totally sucks. The game wasn’t designed with PvP in mind, it was something added to appease a very small audience of players(5ish%). Do casters suck vs. large encounters because of the balance Verant is trying to maintain on the Red servers? If so, that’s the most obscene and ludicrous idea that I've heard.<P>Thou shall not kill'th the MOB, lest ye would have the power to slay thy fellow man!<P>Vendrix<BR>Da`Kor<BR>Cleric whos sick of seeing his friends reduced to speed bumps and log parsers!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Best way to get a good mental picture of how much more damage tanks do now, compared to before, is to compare them to mage pets, because mage pets werent really upgraded:<P>pre-kunark melee classes were upset that mage pets outdamaged them 1.5x over.<P>post-kunark,60 mages are upset that uber rogues outdamage their pets 3x over.<P>there's the rough increase in damage output: 4.5x <P>Basically, if casters (who used to do more damage than melee) were to be given these increases:<P>*Wizard's ice comet would be upgraded from 1000 damage to 4500 damage (for the same mana) <P>*mage/necro pets would be quad attacking for up to 250 damage <P>*A single shaman/druid DoT would be doing rougly 5000 damage every minute.<P><BR>of course, tanks arent all about damage, they were upgraded in their tanking abilities as well. Here's an example (a personal one I can offer) of how the combined defensive/offensive skills of the melee class have made them more effective:<P>***rangers were killed by sonic bats (sol b) with relative ease (pre-kunark)***<P>***rangers can now kill sonic bats w/o even losing half bub hp (post-kunark)***<P>As a final note, want to add that tanks arent overpowered in the slightest; trust me, my 55 ranger isnt overpowered, even if I can solo the same stuff as my 60 magician = )<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>As 54th cleric I would have to agree that the value of or casters is slowly being dwindled away. I've been playng EQ since October '98 and have watched as it's evoloved completely. Wizards and Mages were originally feared and respected for the amount of damage that they did. Melee could equal them over time, but the MOBs were already dead long before then. This made having large groups more valuable then Melee. Now it's a complete reverse with Melee dishing out massive amounts of damage and the casters not able to keep up. I think the idea of Items that would give casters some decreased resists is a excelent idea. I don't think casters should have their damage output increased dramatically to be able to out do Melee though. Think it would cause a severe imbalance to the average players normal XP hunts. We all remember going into Lower Guk and seeing 3 Wizard/Necros camping a room on their own because of that insane damage they could do. I don't want to see us back at a point that where casters once again don't need to group or control a area on their own. We still have that to some extent in outdoor zones with casters kiting large amounts at Mobs at the same time alone that would completely drain and beat down yor normal group. The addition of items to help cast faster and use less mana is going to just increase the casters abilities in this department. While it would be great against the Epc/Uber mob fights it will make them solo kings once again, which needs to be avoided. Resistant reducing gear wouldn't have as large a impact though I think and should definetely be added, even possibly be added to the Epic Weapons for all the casters.<P>I think what happened is Verant saw in pre-kunark that casters were the ruling class. They tried to make some changes so your casters sitting in a dungeon farming items for hours alone didn't happen in Kunark and at the same time give Melee a bit more use then it currently had. They just increased the resists slightly more then what was needed on certain mobs.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Place mana regen items that stack with enchanter mana spells in the game at levels 30, 40, 50 and 60. Possibly give wizards/mages a couple extra through quests.<P>Make some of those items campable others random zone drops.<P>Change haste so it affects spell casting times and introduce a couple haste items in the game that are caster-only.<P>Nerf the uber monsters so normal spells can hit them, they should be immune to one or two elements but not all spells.<P>To balance the above change the snare effect so it breaks in the same manner root does, that will curb a lot of the caster's solo ability and end quad kiting.<P>Pretty simple, no?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Casters should deal more damage than a melee.  They pay for this with there crappy AC and HP.  With the release of Velious's 100% mr mobs, this doesn't hold true.  A caster has to go in and melee if he/she wants to put in some damage...and we all know how there melee skills are haha.  By making mobs 100% resistant, you basically take out Wizards, Necros (pets are still good, but..), Mages (see necros), and enchanters.  If you play one of these classes, you may as well not buy velious cause you can't do anything there anyway.<P>I think part of the problem is that Verant is afraid of making more powerfull DD spells cause of the fact that there will be some people who go to Rathe and one-shot HG's all day for loot.  Or go and solo lguk or solb.  I feel they are trying to protect the old world for lower level/less uber players.<P>I also feel they think melee is the only classes they can upgrade and keep oldworld dungeons sage simply cause a melee can't solo like a caster can.  The strongest warrior with the best items would have a real hard time soloing the ghoul lord, but a wizzie with some new no-resist/2-5k dmg dealing nukes would have now problem...<P>The problem with that is that with mudflation, new mobs require groups of people able to solo old world high level dungeons.  I am interested to see how Verant handles this....  They already put a level limit on Naggy, is the same gonna happen for HG's and old world good loot dungeons?

</FONT><HR>Agree, 100%.  Have thought about this for awhile, just not in these terms.<P>I've always felt Kunark was more melee-friendly.  Just look at the armor drops.  Cobalt helm - AC25, effect serpent sight versus Elder Spiritist's Helm - AC10 (less than a froggie crown) effect Superior Camo (a spell I can already cast at a much longer cast time).  Cobalt Bracer - AC20 effect Shrink(!!) versus Elder Spiritist's Bracer - AC7 (same as a vox bracer) effect share wolf form (a spell that I don't use anyway).  Sure, some of the pieces of ES have ok AC but I can't replace what bracers I wear because I need the wisdom.  But for tank classes, even without the nifty effects, their armor is still superior to what they were wearing because it has ungodly AC, the effects are just a nice bonus.  So now, tanks can buff themselves, summon their own arrows/throwing knives etc., while I'm stuck with a bunch of effects that are just low level versions of spells I already have.  Oh, and if you feel like camping a bunch of greenies in Droga, you can even bind yourself wherever.<P>But wait!  Casters get new spells with the expansion!  But we don't get to buy our spells, oh no!  We have to kill endless amounts of mobs for our spells while all a warrior/rogue/monk/etc just has to type in /disc whatever when they reach the appropriate level.  And so what if I get all my dropped spells.  At level 58 I have no nuke that is capable of outdamaging one double backstab of a rogue of the same level, much less all the other melee damage he does.  Hell, I was fighting shrooms the other day with a couple of other groups on our way to reets/jugs and my group consisted of me and a monk w/epics.  We were getting over 50% of the kills and I usually didn't cast anything other than heal.<P>Point is, you are absolutely correct.  If it weren't for ports, I'd feel totally useless.<P>Carathos Ollathir<BR>58th level druid<BR>Affliction<BR>Erollisi Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Nice post, Vendrix.<P>I think that Verant was horribly shortsighted from day 1. SoV only highlights the fact that Verant never planned for 2 expansions aimed almost exclusively at the high end game.<P>Mistake #1: 1 byte stats. The highest you can get in any given stat is 253. While this worked well pre 50 it's awful post 50. For instance, monks were put at the max on melee skills. As a post 50 reward warriors were placed there as well. Monks had nowhere to go so they basically watched another melee class play catch up.<P>This has hurt casters much worse, however. Casters max meditation at level 50. There are 10 more levels, however. This means the closer you go to 60, the longer it takes you to completely regen your mana pool. This can take, literally, upwards of 10 minutes. Verant's solution appears to be Clarity 2 and Clarity song 2. That's fine and good, provided you have a class to give those to you. Otherwise, grab a book or turn on the TV because you're not going to be doing anything for a while.<P>Mistake #2: Increasing the Magic Resistance of mobs. I have stun. It is literally useless in more than 50% of SoV either because the mob has Lure only MR or else the creature is unstunable (yet another smart move). This has, ironically, increased the need for hybrids while pushing all damage casters out of the picture. Shamen, druids, mages, necros and even enchanters are forced to rely upon whatever other skills they have. Enchanters find this easy. Shamen find it somewhat easy. The rest are, literally, useless.<P>Mistake #3: AE silence (Tunare, Ali the Elder). This is so unbelievably unfair to casters it's not even funny. A single spell that can render 7 classes useless?!?!? This needs to be removed from the game.<P>Quick rundown of the post 50 classes...<P>Warriors - disciplines were awesome and made warriors even more optimal tanks.<P>Monks - watched Warriors catch up to them in melee ability without anything new for them being added. Disciplines were nice but really didn't help. Some skills (like Thunderous Kick) were just plain insulting.<P>Rogues - became the new wizards of combat. Rogues outdamage everyone, period. Backstab for 500 every few seconds really adds up.<P>Paladins - really wasn't much reason to play one and so the post 50 paladin community is often very small. Moreover, they were billed as definitive 1h slash and yet all their defining weapons are 2h. They have improved as a class but are still lagging behind.<P>Shadow Knights - in the same boat as pallies for melee but also really diminished as second rate necros. Giving them Summon Corpse was a good move tho.<P>Rangers - They've come a long way. Tracking is being fixed at last. Arrows can now do lots of damage, making RANGErs a bit more viable there. But rangers have gotten little respect. Their taunt factor is HUGE but they lack the AC to tank. To put it simply, there is no Vision(tm) for a light, fast tank. The high end game requires people to stand next to mobs and beat on them and take whatever is dished out in return. Rangers can give better than just about anyone but they can't take it. Rangers dying has become something of a cliche joke. I've heard rangers going out to putt say jokingly "Well, I'm off to die" only to have it come true shortly thereafter. To have put a ranged weapon class into a game where there was no intent to make ranged weapons a viable mode of combat was a mistake. Go play PSO and roll up a ranger. They're not easy to play, but they can match melees in long range damage. Hopefully EQ2 will make bows and arrows a better form of combat to justify their absurdly low AC.<P>Druids - Druids are a jack of all trades. At low levels they can fill all 3 roles: tank, nuker, healer. As melees begin to break away druid tanking ceases to exist but the other 2 roles remain. Druids actually wind up pretty well at 60... except that they don't excel at anything. They can heal, but not well enough to keep a tank alive. They can nuke, but thanks to the new MR that's pretty much gone. So druids find themselves in the "pretty good" category while the game puts out ads for "Wanted: specialists".<P>Shamen: Verant is scared of shamen. A healing class that can covert HP to mana has potential for abuse. Hence why Verant has refused to upgrade their healing and why Absor has repeatedly stated that he doesn't like Shamen getting Superios Heal. Without the ability to land slow and magic debuffs, shamen have no real uses to a group and that's what the new MR has done. A shaman with slow can keep a group healthy by themselves in Kunark but not in SoV.<P>Clerics: The one dimensional healers with some buffs and res. Clerics have no other roles. Period. Nobody takes a cleric into a group to do anything but buff and heal. And given the nice exp losses Kunark and SoV have it makes begging for a res a near necessity or else throw away hours of exp work. Complete Heal is the only spell that has scaled with the game and as such, it has sparked much class envy. But clerics really don't get much else. Moreover, clerics are not respected by Verant. Nobody listened to the class over MoK and nobody listened to the class over the Donal's nerf. Other options weren't even discussed. As such, many clerics resign in disgust and to replace them many people powerlevel cleric twinks up. As such, finding a good cleric has become much harder. Moreover, Verant has been reluctant to expand the class as they consider them "balanced already".<P>Wizards - aka the "Fixed in RoK" class. Wizards pre 50 had limited uses. Ice Comet was the king of nukes but it really didn't give people much of an incentive to play one. Post RoK came Lures which made the wizards able to nuke practically anything. Wizards have it very good now. They stand as one of the few classes that can attack anything in the game successfully and now find themselves wanted on every raid.<P>Mages - the other nuking class. They have pets and as such they blew past wizards and were enjoyable to play. Post 50, however, they lack lures and as such are often reduced to casting Call of Heroes and summoning pets. Worse, pets are often more of a hinderance than anything else in many areas and pathing sometimes demands that mages be without pets in many areas.<P>Enchanters - Always wanted for their ability to enhance thought, speed melee and slow and even halt mobs, the enchanter has become much more useful in the post 50 game, to the point they are often as required as clerics. They have been hit hardest by the MR increase as they must try to mes or slow mobs while buffing casters and tanks. Unlike the ranger, however, enchanters have no AC and much less HP and, as such, are often the first to die. Their spells have such a high taunt value most healers often spend all their mana trying to keep them alive.<P>Necromancers - the hated class. Necros are notorious for soloing. Snare + fear + pet + DoT = reverse kiting. They have no real grouping spells per se. They can stack DoTs like crazy and lifetap but, even with the low resist lifetap, they just can't keep up past 50. Verant has told them that, in the end game, all they are is mana batteries and pet producers and that is the penalty for having the ability to solo so well.<P>Bards - Bards have it good. They can wear plate, unlike their enchanter parents and they can do the same things... speed melee, speed mana regen and mes creatures, all for 0 mana. Their main problem has been that Verant simply didn't want to acknowledge problems the class has had. Bards have always had a long list of broken or problematic songs.<P>I'm waiting for the final "class balance" stuff to be posted. Hopefully we'll get some things fixed...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Boanerges-CC<P>You don't play post 55, do you?  Or at least not a nuker.<P>After level 55 there is one mob that a nuker/pet user has an advantage, or need in a raid.  Even he can be taken just fine by tanks (Lord Nah'ashir in CoM).  Wizards, even with lure do less damage than a rogue while in full burn.  They are just able to hit, but are more masquitos, just a little irritating to mobs.  They "Can" land a nuke, it's just inconcequintial.  Do logs, I have.  Being a mage, I have time to do so, since my nukes are worthless anywhere a post 55 group would go.  The only spell that has any potintial is AE, but that's limited on what you can do.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am relatively new to this board so I need to ask.  Is this par for the course?  Verant just refuses to respond or reply to these types of posts.  It's funny seeing as the concerned player base are the ones paying their salaries.  I wonder if they all have up to date resumes and good contacts laying the ground work for new jobs when this once great game finally colapses on their heads.  The most frustrating thing to me is not what has happened but their total lack of respect for us in not talking/debating with us.  Basically "we will do what we want you addicts cause we know you will still keep playing."  I so can't wait for SB or DAoC.  "Are you sure you want to send these files to the recycling bin?"

</FONT><HR>Unfortunately I have to agree with Vendrix.<P>I am a 60th level Shaman on Emarr.  A guildmate of Vendrix in fact and deed. I too have levelled my class to 60 and have been nearly everywhere in Norrath, seen everything except for Howling Stone, Sleeper's Tomb, and the Plane of Mischief.  Though unlike Vendrix I'm very familiar with the foul treachery of Ambassador D'vinn.<P>Now I wonder what the point of going to Sleeper's Tomb is going to be if all I am to do is buff and then watch my melee friends do battle.  All I can contribute now is extra lag if I were to go up to a mob and decide to want to melee.  I might even actually cause a guildmate that matters to lag out.  The only thing I could possibly do is heal using Superior Heal and THAT horse has been beaten to death with the same old dirty stick for months now.<P>I am very proud of my guild and what it has accomplished.  More than they can possibly know.  It pains me that I cannot be there to help them.  But basically I understand the fact that I am so secondary to the success of our guild in Sleepers Tomb that I have accepted the fact that all the Sleeper's Keys that we get will first go to the classes that are needed in the zone.  Clerics, Warriors, Rogues, Monks.  However NO CLASS should have to accept this.  None of my friends deserve to feel as if they spent all this time just to have wasted it like Azakar.<P>Prior to guild raids, I could find work doing things shamans were created to do.  Crowd control, buffing, support healing, and support damage.  We weren't the masters of any of these but we at least had a role.<P>Now I am hard pressed in any guild raid to do anything than support heal and buff.   I even find my days as a contributing class numbered as more and more items are being found that are given to melee classes that do what I do.  Weapons that slow, weapons that DOT, weapons that DD, armor that buffs.<P>EVERY other caster class has similar tales of their spells, nay CLASS DEFINING ABILITIES, being handed over to melee classes.<P>I find it funny that nearly every guildmate that was a caster has now made a Warrior or Rogue now.  What does this tell you?  In my opinion only when you have balanced the game can you even hope to balance out the classes.<P>Respectfully,<BR>Warren Magnuson</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Reading this post and others like it, as well as posting a few of my own, and not seeing any sort of response from VI on this issue has brought my eq playing way down.  <P>I am disheartened by the future of my casting characters..  I love casting classes, they are what I choose to play, but it is hard to get excited about finishing them(read getting all the way to 60)knowing that I will become less and less powerful/useful/desired.  The pendilum has swung too far on us.  Melee has been handed the game and the only casting classes that will survive eventually are the healing/buffing classes.<P>Perhaps I appear to hopeless but I can't seem to see it anyother way.  Everyday I read the EQ sites and see all the items dropping in game, you probably do too, and all I see is GODLIKE melee armor/weapons.  Let's face it, they are the only ones who appear to get more and more powerfull with every expansion and new zone that is discovered.  Realy, does it matter all that much that an item has +20int +20wis on it or something once you hit 200int/wis.  No.  So you can move some wis around and maybe get some resist gear or some measly AC.  That won't save you nowadays and it CERTAINLY wont help you land your spells for more dmg.  AND no matter how uber you item is, you still come back to medding at some point.  When does melee have to do this?<P>I hope that someone at VI is beginning to see this flaw and getting worried.  I hope there is some sort of meeting going on trying to reign in the melee powers and begin to address the casting side of things.  I would like to believe that someone there is thinking beyond PVP and limiting casting classes to PRE EXPANSION apropriate dmg spells.  A level 60 pet hits for 2 more dmg then your level 49 pet does.  Could the same be said about a level 49 warrior/munk/rogue etc?<P>Look at the spells being added to hybrid melee'rs on test.  What can't they do?  Besides bind and gate they are almost equally powerfull on dmg output and dmg absorbsion.  Casting classes, are niether.  Almost all the best spells are available on some item somewhere for them.  REgen/haste/resists/heals/speed/invis/dmg shields/nukes/pets/illusions/summons/snare/root. etc.  IT is gone.  <P>Can you see a day when all of the sudden a wiz nuke goes from doing 1100dmg to 3300dmg? no?  Can you see a time when they will stop giving away spell casting abilities to items in game for melee?  Can you see HUGE percentage reductions in casting times or mana costs?  Can you see a time when Mana regens at the same speed as stamina?  I can't see it happening.  All I see is a gradual death for non-healing casting classes, and it is accelerated by every expansion that comes out.<P>a very saddened lvl 51 mage.<P>nerma<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello!<P>/bump.<P>This thread needs to be addressed.  This is definately a problem and it needs to be fixed.<P>The thing that I really don't understand is this Gravedirt fellow.  Which game have you been playing?  I don't see people whining at all here - I see a geniune problem with the game mechanics here.  So what are people supposed to do?  Oh wait lets all just have fun and forget there are problems with the game because we are all having so much fun.  Yeah.  Good idea.  I'll level a wizard to 60, go on a raid and have my spells resisted to no end for hours, in the meantime I will watch melee outdamage me and sit on my butt the whole time.  I am having a blast!  Thats the most fun I have had in a long time.  Oh wait - I'll level up a magician or necro instead and then send my pet in to fight.  Yeah at least now my pet can do some damage and I am contributing SOMETHING.  But wait?!  Wouldn't it be better to put a cleric or melee class in my spot instead?  I can give the cleric mana if I am a necro - that sounds like fun.  I will buff the cleric's mana for hours and send my pet in to fight - but all my other spells are worthless.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  No problem!  I am still having fun, right?<P>Wrong.<P>Just because people are pointing out a flaw in the game doesn't mean they don't care about it.  If they didn't want to continue playing the game why would they waste all this time trying to get the issue fixed?  Telling them to quit because they feel the issue effects their enjoyment of the game is silly.  They have a right to express how they feel because they pay the same monthly fee you do.  If you enjoy your class and see no problems more power to you but don't bash the people who honestly feel there is something wrong and post intelligently in order to get them fixed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>First off, I'd like to say I'm not a caster I have no real grasp on all caster problems.<P>With that being said, I think casters are getting underpowered when you get the numbers out...I also think a LITTLE tweaking could be done to melee DEFENSE skill not attack skill.  Having 1100ac is great but when your pulling a mob or fighting anything and getting hit for full damage all the time by a blue its just obsurd, I think same holds true for casters, greenies and blues should have an extreamly lower chance of hitting.  That's totally off topic I know but I think its important and I threw it in there, sue me.<P>About Casters...my best friends in EQ are casters, Qyesa, Shazanti, Khael, Thallous, ect. ect. I heard their complaints, and well I agree compleately.  Shazanti(a necro) has this "great" spell that's 1000 instant mana...at the cost of a lvl 46-59(not 50 though) person's exp.  Who would use this? really? Spells are getting just rediculous, great effects but the price is just stupid or they get nerfed .000001ms after implemented on live servers with the rare minute chance that someone would actually abuse some of this stuff in such a way.<P>I believe Vendrix compleatly in the fact that he brought up regaurding groups...you walk into Sebilis today you see groups saying "no we don't need you we need a _______" All classes have their disadvantages but some of them far outweigh others.  Verant has fixed a big one, the exp penalty, but they've got a LONG way to go, be it Caster, melee, item effects, whatever, they really need to think before they implement total ****.<P>Regaurding Melee never being able to cast spells, they could in EQ before Kunark or Velious by using potions.  Different yes but spells all the same.  True I don't think my vambraces should be casting caster shielding, or my boots and gloves casting strength, but some effects are reasonable(Infravision being one example).  I guess verant put some of these effects on to give a person a reason to give up some stats for pure ac, I don't know. /shrug<P>Jumbled, mixed up, mispelled, unorganized, those are my views.<P>I'm no caster but I'd hate for my friends to leave because of lack of respect from Verant, I think class armor should be there for them just like any other class, but The Vision(tm) will not allow it.<P>-Breus McBaine<BR> 57th Myrmidon<BR> Affliction</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have no problem with tanks casting spells, or spells on items. <P>The big problem here is that blaster/casters are just that, damage at the cost of not being able to servive if hit (thats why we have tanks to keep things off the casters).<P>Whats the point of being a caster if tanks out damage you? <P>Post 50 is basicly tanks, and tank support classes, magic damage is not keeping up. Add the magic resists and basiclly only reason to bring an other blaster/caster is for any support spells they may bring to the tanks. In almost every case an other tanks is more benifit to a group and a damage caster. <P>Items should drop that make DD's do twice the damage and/or cost half as much mana.<BR>(look at the % increase in damage from a Yak to jade mace, spells post 50 should have the same benifit).<P>Oh well off to play my war twink.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I like some of those ideas Azakar.  I always wondered why there weren't items or buffs that would increase the effectiveness of casters (i.e. decreace cast times, increase specialization skill, decrease resists, etc.).  There are buffs, for instance, that increase a tank's attack rating, so why not have buffs/armor that increase the caster's magical attack rating (i.e. lowers chance of resists or partial resists)?<BR>On the subject of mana-regen items, I can't see much point to them if casters can't land a spell on the mob anyway in SoV.  And a 7 mana per tick item stackable with the clarity line should be ultra-rare or have serious level caps for balance reasons. I don't think it would be unreasonable, however, to have reasonably attainable items that give maybe 2-3 mana per tick.<P>As far as SoV goes, something obviously has to be done to make casters useful again so they don't feel like extras in a movie shoot.  I guess Verant didn't think that giving mobs 15khp+ and making them immune to mez etc. was enough of a challenge for us so they gave them 100% resists.  Blah!!!!   <P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The dirty little secret in the game was always that this wasn't CasterQuest ever.  People used to call it that because melee couldn't bind, had a tougher time with corpse recovery, etc.<P>The fact is, the only thing that matters is combat in this game.  There are annoyances for having to walk a long ways, but you get no xps for anything but butchering monsters, even quests require you to slaughter things (like assassinate the bridge engineers quest for paladins... what a joke).<P>And when it comes down to that, melee always was better.  Yes, casters can solo, in some places.  But when it comes down to groups grinding xps in a dungeon or anywhere, melee is more useful, always has been.<P>Blasting stuff is more flashy, but uses up mana, and that goes away leading to downtime.  The only thing that has changed is that the weapons and armor have made twinks so much more powerful that even the quick damage edge of casters is being eclipsed.<P>Its always been about melee, just recent events have made it more clear... the balance used to be closer.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>2 small suggestions:<P>1. I'm not sure that a caster haste can be implemented in the game. Certainly it won't be very easy. There is another alternative, however. Simply make rare, no drop spell scrolls drop from the high level encounters. Do not make it level based so that every 60th mob will drop it, make it encounter based. Give the wizard who killed Yelinak or the Cleric who went to Zlandicar something to make it worthwile. A better heal, a faster, more efficient nuke. A lifetap that actually affects a mob would allow necros to do something besides med. Alternately, drop an "illegible spell page" that you can do a quest for said spells. <P>2. To make this balanced in PVP, make the spells check against the giant flag. You know, the one that says that all enchanter mes's and stuns will not land. All high level encounters are automatically set to be giant flagged. Make this count for something positive as well as negative. A wizard with this spell still has to rely on his lures for PVP, but can actually affect something in Velious. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Playing a shaman to 60 I have grasped the big VI %)(#*& in the behind when it comes to class useability.  Focus / primal sit down and watch the people fight -- does this sound like fun to you? My only use is for added hps and minimal buffs..  That bieng said when it comes time like others have mentioned to get keys or if you have absolutly necessary classes in SoV the shaman class is not one of those classes considering im only there for one purpose to toss out a few buffs then add my lag to the others<P>VI has made a serious mistake when it came to casters.. I also have a 50 magi that I do not intend on playing though he used to be fun to play pre kunark... Now I will do as any other smart person who actually wants to have some fun in a major fight do -- Play a warrior or rogue<P>The problem is that casters are so seriously looked over when it comes to upgrades and general issues its pathetic.. Why cant we have haste spells for our spells or haste items for our spells?? Or like Azakar&lt;ugly duck boy&gt; said items that decrease the resistance of the epic mob or any mob for that matter so our spells CAN actually make us usefull???  <P>Wait I forgot a lvl 60 is gonna be runing around soloing the green mob camps that any lvl 60 is dead set against even going near and ruin the balance of the game cause they have these UBER items &lt;insert donals bp here&gt; <P>VI you already have a pathetic excuse of a CS department although Emarr is blessed with Valtron who actually DOES care about his server ... when it comes to Abasor and Abashi it is nearly like a presidential coverup trying to get things out of you all<P>So what is the big deal? why cant you admit you F%)($#& up and actually do the right thing and FIX the problem??<P>Fionord<BR>60 Oracle<BR>Storm's Fury<BR>Erollisi Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057442-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057442.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057442-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057442-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057442-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057442-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057442&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057442&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
