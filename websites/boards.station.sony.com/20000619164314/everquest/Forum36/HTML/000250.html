&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>I am prompted to post this because of a warning i was issued for XP killing earlier today, and i would genuinely like to see some general discussion on this topic.  Now, i'm not here to whine about how the oppressive GM's have stifled my will to play; i think the GM in question(sorry, forgot name) dealt with me very fairly and given a similar situation, i would most likely have issued a warning as well.  <P>Here was the situation:  <BR>I have been soloing in the frontier mountain zone since i got my charm song at lvl 27(i am almost lvl 30 now), and i've found the best place to charm stuff is an open area northwest of the giant castle, lots of space, good sight radius, and it seems to be between the 'easy' and the 'hard' side of the zone, giving a good mix of creatures.  I returned to my spot after a break and noticed a group of three dark elves had taken up station in the middle of my area.  There was a mage, a SK, and i'm not sure on the other, cleric maybe.  I don't know what lvl they were, but were all were red to me.  I decided to try to scare them away from my spot, so i charmed a nearby mountain giant and told it to attack.  <P>For those of you who don't know how bard charm works, here's the scoop:  The song, Solon's Song of the Sirens, charms a monster for a maximum of three ticks (9 seconds), and is not refreshable, meaning that you have to wait for the charm to wear off before you can recharm the mob.  The other feature of Solon's is that when the charm is applied, and not when it cancels, it is a complete mem whipe for everyone except the bard.  This means that the monster can still build up hatred for players while it's charmed, making it VERY difficult to use in cross-race groups, and is really only a solo-ing tool on the PvP servers.  <BR>What this adds up to is that if you sic a pet on someone and they fight back against the pet, and it killes them while un-charmed, they loose XP.<P>So anyway, the giant tore into whoever it was i quick-targeted, i think it was the mage.  I expected them to take off, leaving me with the angry giant, but they tried to fight it, so i dinked and dunked around the rocks they were sitting on and got through a couple charm cycles before they started casting on me.  I got nuked and then blinded, so i do what i always do when i get blinded, i ran away until it wore off.  By the time i got back, the giant was just finishing off the last of them, and it and another giant came after me, of course.  Giants are really hard to get to fight other giants, so i thought it was a good time for a bank run, and to also give them time to collect their belongings and find other, less bard-infested hunting grouds.  After banking and chatting with some people(and recieving a few verbose tells from the group), i returned about an hour later to find them back in the same spot.  I grabbed another giant and set it upon them again.  They were a little more ready for me this time, and i got blinded right away, so i ran off again.  I had informed them of the way bard pets work, but when i returned, the giant had finished them off.  What i didn't know was that there was a cloaked guide there watching, and i was issued a warning for XP killing.  The guide was very nice though, and humored me in a lengthy discussion about verant policies on this issue.  What i gathered from the conversation is that in order to use pets in pvp and not be issued a warning, a bard will have to make a reasonable effort to keep their pet charmed and avoid XP loss for their enemy.  This policy presents serveral difficulties.<P>1. What constitutes a reasonable effort?  Obviously guides can't be everywhere, and player mediation is an important part of PvP.  Perhaps this thread will help to answer this question.<P>2. What happens in a case like mine where an opponent's action(blinding me in this case) renders me unable to control my pet?  Almost every class has a spell that would do this: snare, root, mez, blind, stun, ect.<P>3. What happens if my pet gets in the death blow between charm cycles?  I know when i'm charming for routine hunting, my pets are only under charm for approxamately 1/2 the time, and even pets that i've charmed successfully have been known to have up to 10 resists in a row.  <P>4. What happens when i feel i am loosing a fight and wish to retreat?  I know when i played a magician, i often let my pet deal with an opponent while i ran and hid.  Am i obligated to hang around and keep my pet charmed<P>5. Similarly, what happens when in the normal course of hunting, i get jumped by a pkiller?  Must i save my attacker by not running, doing nothing but keeping my pet charmed, while they pound me into dust?<P>6. After the pkiller(or anything else for that matter) pounds me into dust, am i then responsible if my now uncontrolled pet finishes them off?<P>I'm sure you can think of more of these kind of situations.<P>The delimma of my the situation is obvious; do we try and kill a very nasty bard pet, or go after the bard and risk loosing xp?  I proposed to the guide, that if someone wanted to avoid XP loss from a bard pet, they could simply not attack the pet, but i was told that i cannot expect the players to not defend themselves, which certainly makes sense.  I suppose i could set up a /ooc hotkey that explains the way bard charm works and spam it whenever i think there's someone off-race in the zone(e.g. constantly).  Like i said, i am not here to ***** and whine about the warning i was given, it really doesn't bother me much at all; i know i wasn't trying to XP kill, and i am a more aware player for it.  I would like however, to see some vigorous discussion on this point, because i think it's something that we of the PvP servers need to talk about.  The simple answer of 'don't charm stuff' is not going to cut it.  Asking a class to just not use their skills because it may inconvenience their enemies is not acceptable.  Bump if you'd like, but i'd like some serious conversation here.<P>Deiko<BR>&lt;Norrath's Elite&gt;<BR>bard of the 6th page, 4th song</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hmmm... that clears up a lot.  Thank you for the explanation of Bard charm mechanics.<P>I've been exped by bards more than any other class - and in just this manner.  (In fact, I think only once have I NOT been exped by a bard pet. And that was because a gnome necro got the killing blow.) <P>It's usually followed by a song and dance (appropriate) about how I shouldn't have lost exp - it was charmed - if the charm breaks it agros the bard first - yadda yadda.<P>Given the mechanics of Bard charm, ANY atempt to use it in PvP should be considered an intentional attempt to Exp kill an opponent. <P>That's how I'm going to treat it from here on out...<P>Grimjakk<BR>Shadoewatch<BR>Tallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>oh yes, lets once again make the lowly bard even lower! Obviously the group could have at least tried to run away, and what about all those PKing mages, necros and shadowknights who wait until a creature has almost killed you, you are just about to get away and they blind you nuke you whatever and the beast finishes you off?  I have lost a lot of exp from PKers as a bard, and I consider it part of the risk. Deal with it. Its bad enough that none of our songs (save maybe the invisibility and heal) are worth a damn compared to spells and we are granted such a high amount of melee (JOKING) to compensate.  Verant COULD allow the song to last for a few minutes like a ranger's pet, but that would be intelligent.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum36&number=36&thisthread=000250&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum36&number=36&thisthread=000250&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
