"How many of you ever even tried to use gate or port when your gettin beat on?

Why?  We are masters of DIRECT damage, not AREA damage, however we have more AoE Suicide Spells than DD?  How about we call them SS for short from now on?

</FONT><HR>Rainlin,<BR>Forgive me, but how high have you played your wizard?  I think you underestimate the power of the AOE spells.  If you're soloing, true, AOE are not a great idea.  But I've stood in awe and watched while four wizards, a cleric and a paladin (puller) TRASHED an entire dungeon - while the cleric complained of being bored, and the wizards were kidding the pally "What?  Why'd you only bring five or six?" because they could handle ten to twelve per pull so long as the mana held out.<P>I'll let someone else take you to task for wanting snares removed.  Oh, and BTW, wizards don't have any AOE DOTs.<P>SoulFrost DeDanaan<BR>42nd Enchanter<BR>Order of the Jade Dragon<BR>Xegony<P>Rhian B'Zorch<BR>23rd Wizard<BR>Order of the Jade Dragon <BR>Xegony<P>p.s.

Wizzys have LIMITED hps, and LIMITED armor, Im sitting pretty with 612 hps and a 426AC, and a 181INT at level 34, and I am NOT a twink, Im the best damn "non tweek" wizzy ever to grace Bertox.  I formulate plans, and I can tell you ahead of time how horrably your plans will fail. A party is only as good as the quality of the members in it.  Im the group leader that will not be afraid to kick you fmro my group for being a rageing idiot.  Mistakes are acceptable, but being an idiot is not.  I bet you fight anything worth giving you exp, and in about 10 hits your dead.  game over, cleric can cast as fast as your losing hps, thats all there is to it, OH! and not to mention that thier AoE spells, affect the caster as well...brainiack, come up with a new story.<P>Rainlin Weatherhem,<BR>*Thinks some of these wannabee's need to learn when and when NOT to bull**** someone  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Rainlin,<BR>  I don't really believe you are the best wizard on Bertox just by listening to you.  I too play on bertox as a level 35 wizard, non-twinked with 200 int and a little over 100 extra in mana items.  As far as AoE in dungeons, I've done it several times, you just have to know when to do it.  As a matter of fact I've saved my group before by using AoE in a dungeon.  Also I've seen pictures of the tactic that ArcherBear was talking about, and unless it was doctored up I counted that the particular wizard that did the screenshot did several thousand damage on one cast.  Not sure which spell it was, but it must have been a high level one with no limit to the amount of targets.  They were using enchanters to mezz the targets and then all the wizzies would AoE them for incredible damage, then mez, then AoE.  It can work if you know how to do it.<P>Wizards do still need work, though, as AoE spells cannot be used that often, and a lot of times that they can be used there is an enchanter in the group and everyone just wants the enchanter to mez.  We really need work from the mid levels on.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Rainlin, you have sooooooooo embarrassed yourself with the answer you gave about AOE spells in dungeons.<P>Look, at lvl 34, you're still a low level and low skill, therefore AoE will get you killed in a dungeon.<P>That said, there are groups and players good enough to form what they call AOE groups, most commonly held in Sebilis.<P>Here's basically how it works.<P>4 wizzies (or 3 and a magician)<BR>1 puller (pick someone who likes trains)<BR>1 enchanter.<P>Puller pulls (the best record I know off is 23 mobs AoE killed in Sebilis by a player on Bristlebane called Bramel - To his credit, he was the enchanter and was also the puller.)<P>Essentially, when the mobs come back, the Enchanter chain AoE stuns (meaning enchanter casts it over and over again) while all the casters chain cast area effect spells. When all the mobs are dead, med up and repeat. The chain stun keeps the mobs from ever actually hitting an AoE caster.<P>So Rainlain, all your big talk about kicking people out of your group who would try such a thing is a comment that you're basing purely on your experience and at such a low level (34 is nothing to write home about) is to be expected.<P>Not quite the master tactician you thought you were, are you?<P>Afangia<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Rain you're missing what's really wrong with wizards. It's not our selection of spells, or the purpose of them. Instead it's how we stack up to the rest of the classes in terms of contribution to a group.<P>Before Kunark it wasn't much of a problem as wizards were pretty well balanced (if not overpowered). However, Kunark weapons have made melee the kings of the 51+ world. Wizards, being the only class that totally relies on direct damage to contribute to a group, are hurt the most by this.<P>What we wizards really need is either an indirect method of contributing to a group (other than dd) or greater mana efficiency to keep up with melee output. Our snare is fine (seems like you need to learn how to use it), our AEs are fine (especially past 51), our armor spells are as good or better than other casting classes, and our Lures set us apart from the other nuking classes.<P>Verant's vision on what a wizard is supposed to be is fine - namely dish out magical damage. It's just that they didn't provide the wizard with the appropriate tools for the task after adding Kunark melee weapons to the game.<P>Delilah<BR>60 Sorceress</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

If that is your game Rainlin please keep it to yourself.  It only goes to motive of a weak minded power gamer who hasnt caught on to any nuance of the game beyond power gaming.<P>Just because you have little experience in the game doesnt mean you have to show the world how inept you are at your art by condeming a class you have little knowledge of.  <P>If you had any experience at all you might know that the Staff of the Wheel quest is found fully at www.graffe.com (where competent Wizards share information, not on EQDruids).  <P>Before asking for the nerfing of snare you might try using it to solo with for a level or eighteen.  <P>Before condeming AOE spells you might try a week of quad kiting to take you from 34 to 44, or joining a group of casters inside Seblis who chain stun and AOE multiple mobs for thouands of points of damage without ever taking a point of damage to their thin skins.<P>I suppose you made this a separate thread away from the Wizard class balance hoping for attention?  You have my attention now.  I expect I wasted more time typing a response than you are worth, but you did get some attention.  <P>You are more than welcome to your opinion, but when you have no idea what you are talking about and call for a nerf to my chosen main class you deserve to be told you have no clue what you are talking about. Wizards do have problems with being the masters of magical damage.  They do not need to be compounded.<P>I did find merit with your suggestion to add wall spells however, we do have push and hurl spells already accounted for.  Thunderstrike(29) and Gravity Flux(44).  I dont think I care about a remake of Bigby's Hand line in this game, but thats just me.<P>There are some wonderful ideas on the wizard's threads that will actually help achieve some balance.  You might want to read through some of them to see what people who have been playing this class a long time have experienced.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Let me spell out to you how AE works. Since you seem so skeptical of AE, I'll use actual numbers.<P>Karnor's Castle. Average mob has around 6k hps. Can pull as many as 20 mobs from the basement at once if you so desire. Since my personal best is only 14 at a time, let's use that.<P>Group composition was 2 wizards, 1 druid, 2 enchanters, plus a few clerics and tanks. In all we had 2 groups of 5.<P>When the tank brings 14 mobs, the trick is to have the enchanters AE stun till they are all bunched up together. Then wizards chain Jylls Static Pulse (2s cast, 285 mana, 495 damage) and Jylls Zephyr of Ice (2s cast, 313 mana, 594 damage). The damage is to ALL mobs in a radius around you. That's why it's important to bunch them all up.<P>Each cast of Static Pulse does up to 6930 damage for 285 mana or a 24 to 1 mana efficiency. Zephyr does up to 8316 damage and has a ratio of almost 27 to 1. Each wizard would have to cast about 7 AEs to kill every mob between the 2 of them and they would still have about 20% mana left.<P>The trick is to AE stun to keep the mobs off the wizards. Enchies have 3 of these at their disposal so they can easily keep 14 mobs permanently stunned. This particular train was dropped in less than 30 seconds with no casualties. In fact, the only one that took any damage was the puller.<P>Should try it sometime. Wizard AE is the best in the game by far. And no, it's not useless.<P>Delilah<BR>60 Sorceress<BR>Emarr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Risk vs. reward... I would pee my kilt if someone asked me to try that  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  I also have to wonder how many deaths were sucked by various participants before they had it down to the "20 at a time" level.  (I'm guessing a non-trivial number.)  And it requires a perfect match of classes even more than people think a standard one-at-a-time group does.  <P>IMHO, AEs are fine as they stand--dramatically increased efficiency at dramatically increased risk--but single-target DDs are out of whack compared to others' damage output.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Rainlin, some basic concepts for you:<P>First, learn the power of the spells you have.  Single mob, no pets, the rain spells will generally do as much if not more damage to that mob than your DD spell.<P>Second, AoE spells work very well, even when NOT in an AoE group, you just need to learn how and when to use them.  I've been in many groups, start with a bonds of force, or Atol's Spectral Shackles, wait a little bit, then go in, and use your PB AoE spells, then run back out from the melees.  Let the enchanter mezz the mobs again, duck back around, AoE, mezz, repeat.  With this method, a group with even a single wizard will take down a set of 6 mobs without much of a problem.  Just remember to use a powerful enough AoE to agro the mobs to you.<P>I've experimented a bit with all of this, and have used it in practice, it works well, and the tanks appreciate not being bored because only one mob is free at one time, without endangering the group.  <P>From what you have said, it's clear you've never worked with a highly experienced group that knows how to work well together.  It's not always easy to find, but a well balanced group can do amazing things.  Groups that let the wizard use rains(up to 1800 damage from Tears of Druzzil for under 400 mana), and will set up pulls, but then pull the "active mob" away from the mezzed mobs to encourage this sort of activity will give a new appreciation for the wizard class.  Groups that will allow a wizard to use AoE also tend to clear mobs VERY VERY VERY quickly.  Those that limit themselves to DD spells, and medding, are the players that make people not want to group with them.  I've had tanks amazed when they see wizards using our full abilities, just because so few use them.<P>  The fact that you havn't learned how to control agro yet is also obvious.  There are times when mezz breaks that it can be up to the wizard to save the group.  Over 54 levels, I've made a LOT of friends, just by knowing that sometimes it's better to agro the mobs to yourself and then run, than to stay and have the group die.  Paladins do it, there are a few skilled wizards that do it, warriors do it all the time.  The trick is knowing when it's time to do massive damage, and then run.  Worst case, you save your group by getting yourself killed.  Best case is you've done so much damage with your AoE, that the group is able to kill the mobs before YOU get killed.  Remember, snare is a form of crowd control too.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
