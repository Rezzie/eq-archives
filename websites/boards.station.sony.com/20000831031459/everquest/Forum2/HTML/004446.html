</FONT><HR>My friend who I spoke of earlier today was BANNED from EQ for something he didn't do. He sent me the email, here it is for everyone to see:<P>-----------------------<P>Greetings,<P>This in regards to the account Lesssthannjakee. Any time an account becomes suspended it gets put into a reviewed for banning. After the review<BR>the account we have found that it was used to try to duplicate items and scamming of a GM. We take a very strong stance against such issues. At <BR>this time we have no choice but to ban the account from EverQuest. I am very sorry it has come to this point but people that decide to not follow the rules and polices that set are not wanted in our world. Good luck and good day.<P>Rod L. Haza<BR>Lead GM Dartok<BR>Verant Interactive, Inc.<P>-----------------------<P>Someone TRADED duplicated items to this character and others (long story short) and because he and several other characters had some of these duplicated items on them (btw we have no clue how they were duplicated) they were suspended and now banned because of the reasons stated above. This is CRAZY!!!<P>I know that posting on this board does absolutely nothing and that emailing verant does absolutely nothing. However, given the choice, and the fact that my friend can email verant while he can no longer come to these boards, I thought I would post it here so at least some of the player base can see this abuse of power.<P>Let me tell you one thing I know as a good friend to this person: he might have had a few warnings, but they were for goofing around, not cheating. There is no way he was involved in duplicating items and the only proof the GMs had was that some of the items he had were DUPLICATED. Then, the part about scamming GMs, is because he told them the truth and they didn't believe it!<P>So, you want to ban my account now too? Hit me, I don't even care. I've already cancelled it.<P>- Salien Curealot<BR>Former Level 50 Cleric<BR>Tired of seeing CS staff ruin a great game</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I wasn't looking for supporters - heck I wasn't the one who was banned! I simply wanted everyone to see how easy it is to get banned with so little information. He was suspended for 8 days with no information, then they said they were giving him his account back after they removed the deleted items (which obviously didn't happen), then they banned him.<P>- Salien "Clarifyalot" Curealot<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I think the main problem is that CS has no real way to find out a) who did the duping first  b) if the person recieving the duped items knew about it and was inovled in a scam.  They are told by their managers to assume guilt unless the player (who usually can't) provides evidence to the contray.  They'll assume, if the player is addicted enough, that they'll start over with a new account (blowing another $40.00).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Do you really think that they sit in a room over at Verant HQ trying to figure out how to ban people?<P>Also, you cannot get warnings for simply goofing around... 3 times even!  And someone with so many warnings just happens to innocently have dup'd items in his inventory... yea right!<P>Look, perhaps you guys should play a little Diablo II open games.

</FONT><HR>"he might have had a few warnings, but they were for goofing around, not cheating."<P>Funny, I goof around *all* the time, and not once have I ever received a GM warning.<P>"I believe he has one warning for disrupting a GM event and another for training someone."<P>This is "goofing around"??? I hate to tell you, but this *is* cheating. Cheating is doing something against the rules. You have to repeatedly train someone in order to get a GM to show up. And as far as the disrupting a GM event goes, how many people's fun were ruined because he was doing something so disrupting it warranted a warning? Sounds to me like your friend's banning was justified. And you've cancelled your account too? Good riddance. If you're the type to hang with a guy that enjoys ruining the fun of other people, maybe the next GM event on your server will actually go smoothly with the two of you gone.<P>Quite frankly, whenever someone is accused of doing something wrong, the history of their actions will come into the decision. When you go around being a jerk to other people (training them and ruining GM events) you gain a reputation of being a jerk. Then whenever something really bad like this happens, your character is suspect. I do not know if your friend knew that his items were duplicated or not, but judging from the actions you have mentioned here, he's definitely the type to do it. <P>The best way to ensure that something like this doesn't happen to you is to play the game by ALL the rules, and be cooperative whenever the GMs do show up. Be helpful whenever you can. It's amazing the difference in the amount of trust people give you when you haven't wronged them before.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>i personally have only had to deal with the GM's three times. Once besause I was stuck, and two other times because of broken quests. Never have I in all my goofing around ever gotten a warning. Hell, I haven't even been yelled at by other players. The last time I dealt with a GM he fell out a window. You know when a GM comes to you they always pop up 6ft in front of you? Well I was looking out a window in the upper levels of Kelethin  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> oop. Even then all the GM did was laugh. In my experiance you actually have to work to get a warning. And when you do get one it is logged in your account information (one of the reasons it is rarely done, who wants to do more paperwork?) So even if your friend is totally innocent in this his previous actions warrant the banning. If he had never before recieved a warning they would most likely just ask him to delete the duped items. I know, i was a Aprantice guid on Karana about 6 months back.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I wasn't looking to be flamed. Again, I'm not sure myself that he is innocent. But I'm pretty sure. And that should be enough unless there is some evidence against him.<P>Sure, warnings and suspensions should be given out based on only some inconclusive evidence. They are only temporary and even if the person is wrongly acused, it's not a huge deal.<P>BANNINGS should require some solid evidence - they are, after all, permanent. Heck, Guides take such extreme care when giving out warnings: they need to ACTUALLY SEE YOU DOING SOMETHING WRONG whereas GMs will just ban you on cirumstancial evidence!<P>Why can't they take the same care as guides to actually see someone duping and trading items or have pretty darn good evidence based on monitoring of activities ( I thought GMs and Senior guides were supposed to do investigative work?! ) <P>Had they said in that email, "You've been banned because a senior guide was appointed to monitor your activities. This senior guide watched you make a deal with person_x for 15 fbss's and 15 golden efreeti boots after giving person_x only one of each. Person_x has a reputation for duping items. We've banned you both." ... or something like that.<P>If that were the message, I wouldn't be here and I would be telling my friend that he deserved it very much. But when he claims he didn't do it, I don't think he did it and all the evidence the GMs have is a hunch or a guity-until-proven-innocent mandate, I don't believe that's fair. This is the point I am trying to make. <P>Btw, I have two warnings myself. One of them is also for disrupting a GM event. I consider this goofing around - a GM was deathtouching anyone who wasn't registered at the event who went into the battle area. I thought it would be fairly amusing if I feared my friend into it, knowing there was no xp loss and he was bound right there, and the GM gave us both warnings after deathtouching us both and having the whole zone erupt into laughter. THATS goofing around, not cheating. <P>Salien</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>first off GM's dont investigate most of the time. THEY SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THE TIME and are not paid well enough to do a practical investigation. Secondly most of them simply don't care. In fact I am willing to bet that they go on gut instinct alone since most of the times the incidents are older than one week. Yep one week is how long their logs last, pretty stupid if you ask me. These guys are bigger than an ISP and isps keep their logs longer than verant.

I had a bunch of friends and a guild mate suspended under the same sort of accusations: having duped items.<P>They were compeltely exonerated (unfortuneatly they didn't ban one of the people who has been scamming people and who acted in ways to cause us to assume he had a GM buddy) and given their accounts back a week later without so much as an apology.<P>Tell yer friend to go take an EQ vacation and come back once VI reinstates them.<P>Yeah, posting and emailing doesn't seem to help, but it makes ya feel better.

</FONT><HR>&lt;&lt;BANNINGS should require some solid evidence - they are, after all, permanent. Heck, Guides take such extreme care when giving out warnings: they need to ACTUALLY SEE YOU DOING SOMETHING WRONG whereas GMs will just ban you on cirumstancial evidence!&gt;&gt;<P>If that were the case, no one would ever get banned.  You have any idea how hard it is to actually see you doing something?  Even if a GM did spy on your activities ingame, they are pretty conspicuous, all youd have to do is behave till they leave.  Besides, you dont think they have alternate means to figure things out that players might not be aware of?  <P>That aside, his history probly did him in. Its not like EQ is a democracy, trial by jury etc.  Verant can do what it wants.  If they didnt ban people who look pretty damn guilty but they just dont have that one piece of damning evidence, people would be posting here that Verant never does anything to police the game.<P>IMO, you dont get banned while being an innocent player.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

Now, what we were doing was moving the fight right on top the wizard, so if he tried to root it, we could back off and it would attack him.   We WERE NOT training this feeb, we were just fighting and this scumbag was feeding off of us for hours stealing almost every yellow mob - all named spawns and being an ass about it. <P>He called a guide, who told me "Don't you ever do that again, this is a warning."  and then refused to answer any of my tells or petitions after.<P>I know that most of the jerks are just here to laugh at someone else's misery, but I think that's a crap attitude.  Verant has a huge game, and they try to enforce policies to make life livable for the people who really don't abuse the system.

</FONT><HR>There is a lot to this story that Salien isn't telling. Basically, Slayden, a char on bertoxx was going around promising people RL cash or in game items for their accounts. Bermanx, a well known idiot/trainer/lootwhore on the Bertoxx server (After he got moved back from TT) got into cahoots with Slayden and gave him his password. Slayden then used Bermanx to dupe items, and to transfer duped items. When Slayden got over ambitious, word of his exploits got out, and someone he was trying to scam by getting their password ripped him off, and some how the GMs found out about the whole issue, and indiscriminately banned everyone with a duped item in their account, including some people that just got theirs by trades.<P>Since then, many have had their accounts restored. Bermanx got banned. Honestly, I think he deserved it. He is young, admittedly, but this guy payed people to KS rare MOBs. He intentionally FD trained people that he wanted out of a camp spot on multiple occasions. He payed people to powerlevel him, and basically, he is generally regarded as an idiot by the whole server. He was dumb enough to give his password to a complete stranger, and he knew items were being duped. He admitted it on the message board, but he still wants to be held blameless. <P>Sorry, Salien, Berman deserved it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Berman was banned because the GM's after searching the logs, found that his character (With or without his knowledge/consent) was used to dupe high end items.<P>The problem here is actually a long drawn out process where he was conned into giving his account information to an unsavory person.<P>Perhaps this is the lesson people need, sorry it has to be your friend, but he brought it upon himself.<P>I'm sorry, but GM's will not arbitrarily make decisions like that, even if it was in fact Djembe in the first place to make the decisions. I would bet that there was a higher up involved in this particular problem.<P>That being said, I will take this time to defend Djembe.<P>I recently had an issue where my Box of Abu-Kar went poof with a game bug.<P>He answered my petition (3 days later when he was scheduled to be there.) and actually checked the logs.<P>How do you know he checked the logs you ask?<P>It took him about 45 minutes to get back to me, and STATED that I lost it in West Freeport, and told me the exact location that it "Vanished".<P>He knew from my information that it was in West Freeport, but I never told him where I was standing when it went poof. Therefore, I know that he did his duty, checked the logs, found it to be a legitimate poofing, and returned my Box.<P>Even if I had not gotten the box back. I would have been content that he went and did the research he was supposed to do.<P>I will say that it is a refreshing pace from the GM we had before him (No not Valtron the there for one day) Tinysa. Tinysa did things in the method that you are accusing of here. She would have happily banned Berman for whatever reason. <P>That being said. I think that the banning has reasons, and Verant has always said. YOU are responsible for your account. "Little Brother" or "Aliens from Mars" excuses won't help in situations such as this.<P>Again, this is a lesson learned. Read the rules if you want to play the game.

</FONT><HR>Well,<P>This post has nothing to do with Berman as a person.<P>This has to do with assumed GM bannings without reason. (At least that's how I percieve the intent of this post.)<P>The Banning in fact had plenty of reason. There were many infractions.<P>I just came forward with the other side of the story that was convieniently left out.<P>It was no way an attack on Berman, though I have had my share of trouble with him. (As Pkin mostly)<P>Like I said before, use it as a learning experience. If the rules say "Duping is bad, and you will be banned." and "Don't give out your passwords, you are responsible for your account." Listen to it....there is a reason they say it.<P>Good luck in your next game Berman, I hope you learned the hard lesson.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>It's easy to come here to the boards and assume that something bad is going on behind the scenes because we don't come provide public "proof" for the account actions we take.  We will discuss these issues, but only with the account holder and only via email.  We don't drag these issues out to the court of public opinion. <P>&gt;&gt;&gt;BANNINGS should require some solid evidence - they are, after all, permanent. <P>Bannings do have solid evidence, or we don't do them.  It would make sense for us to systematically kick customers off the system, and thus off of our balance sheets, by doing bannings without proof.  Please don't assume that just because we won't come here to the boards to "tell our side" that the proof doesn't exist. <P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Had they said in that email, "You've been banned because a senior guide was appointed to monitor your activities. This senior guide watched you make a deal with person_x for 15 fbss's and 15 golden efreeti boots after giving person_x only one of each. Person_x has a reputation for duping items. We've banned you both." ... or something like that.<P>We won't even give this level of detail to the person banned, let alone state it publicly.  I'm sorry, but this is necessary in order for us to conduct business.  If we divuldged in detail all of our investigative abilities and powers, we'd open ourselves to those who would search out potential loopholes.  <P>-Gordon<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I remember way back when.  You guys would ALWAYS announce public bannings.  Ak`Anon Alliance anyone?  Most people who caused trouble were announced to have been banned in the /motd or somewhere else.  I recall seeing it plastered all over EQ Vault "Yay!  Soandso has finally been banned!"<P>*shrug*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Abashi, the GM's have made mistakes before and I'm sure they'll continue to not be perfect in these regards.<P>I have seen a few very poor GM decision myself on Vallon, so I know it happens.  Of course, you're going to automatically stick up for your employer.  If you didn't, you probably won't be employed long.  And the fact is, banning one customer (or even a hundred) isn't going to hurt ya that bad.  So if you make a mistake..big deal (from your standpoint).  <P>But I can say with certaintly, that if you were that one player, you were sure you were innocent, you'd be talking to anyone that would listen to get your account back (if for principle alone).<P>Don't automatically discount these kinds of posts under the auspices of "We NEVER ban a player without good reason".  Hell, real courts of law make mistakes, I bet EQ does too.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Anyone else remember all those folks that were banned a few months back, that were reinstated?  After Verant FINALLY reviewed their case and realized, "Oops."<P>I think it was posted over at EQ Druids about their incident.<P>And what ever happened to that poor chap who was timing the spawns?
