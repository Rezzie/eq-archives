</FONT><HR>When I started playing this game over a year ago. I was told by a lot of people, including GM's and guides that Firey Avenger was the end-all, be-all, Uber weapon in the game that defined what a Paladin really is. It gives them a chance to shine as a class. Gives them a chance to become really what they were meant to be . . . a true holy warrior.<P>Well now everyone gets a Uber weapon.<P>What is the FREAKING POINT in playing a FREAKIN paladin. Any cleric that is the same level as me is going to have better spells. Any fighter that is the same level as me is going to out damage me and have more hit points. When compared to these classes at the same level there is only two words that come to mind. . Piss Poor. That is where Firey Avenger comes in. It defined a Piss Poor class that can never cast spells good enough or fight well enough to do anything. Now you have taken away the only thing that matters to most paladins.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/mad.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I never got my Ghoulbane until Level 40, I still don't have a Soulfire and a Fiery Avenger is a fond dream.<P>Don't play a Paladin becuase you want some phat loot.

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;the end-all, be-all, Uber weapon in the game <P>I may be wrong, but I don't think it would be appropriate to attach the best weapon in the game to a level 50 quest (Remember--this is a Pre-Kunark weapon).  I've read that there are more powerful weapons dropping off of Kunark MOb's.<P><BR>&gt;&gt;It gives them a chance to shine as a class. <BR>&gt;&gt;Gives them a chance to become really what they <BR>&gt;&gt;were meant to be . . . a true holy warrior.<P>I have yet to fight alongside of a pally (who knew how to play as a pally) that didn't shine as a class.  They make VERY good tanks, deal out a decent amount of damage, and do wonders for aiding clerics during post-battle recovery.  They can crush undead with a holy vengeance (pun intended), and can save a life and turn the tide in a battle with a mere touch of their healing hand.  What is the point of being a Paladin?  To be a defender, not a walking slaughterhouse.  <P><BR>&gt;&gt;What is the FREAKING POINT in playing a FREAKIN <BR>&gt;&gt;paladin. <P>If having a "more special" weapon than every other class was your only reason for playing a pally, I'm sorry.  It's been said many times that the classes should be balanced, even if they aren't.  The only thing that might lead one to believe that Paladins are supposed to be the "Über" class is having Firiona Vie, a Paladin, as the game mascot.<P>There are many things in the game that make it worth playing.  The Fiery Avenger is most likely one of them for Paladins, but I don't think that should be the only goal, and most certainly not the pinnacle of your adventures.  If that were the case, there wouldn't be anything left to do after level 53.  =)<P>Personally, as a Ranger, I have spent a couple of weeks /played wandering the world, trying to find what it is that drives me to keep playing my class.  In that time, I've discovered many fighting methods, explored many strange lands, completed quite a few quests, and decided that I *love* being a Ranger.  Life didn't stop when I made my Trueshot bow, nor did it end when I first viewed myself in full Ivy Etched armor.  All I did was ask myself "OK, what's next?" and continue my journeys with my friends, helping them with their quests and learning more about the world of Norrath.  The new "Über" weapons just added another goal for me to strive for.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Paladins were Verant's coverboys when EQ first came out. It seems to have gone down hill from there. While I have no opposition to other classes getting epic quest weapons, VI should not have made the promises they did with Paladin swords(Fiery Avenger promised for over a year, then a few months later, new class defining weapons which everyone gets). Fiery swords and such did define the paladin when those weapons were once useful(ex. Soulfire) I havn't seen the all the stats on all these new weapons but, hopefully, if rogues get such a good weapon that can be duel wielded with another good weapon maybe the paladin and Sk swords will be even better to make up for the low offense and inability to duel wield. Let's just wait and see though until we make too many judgements. Paladins truly aren't a cover art class anymore but at least they still have their usefulnesses at certain times.<P>Thanakos Trueblade<BR>Defenders of Light</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I think it is time for clarification.  I am not opposed to other classes having "epic" quests.  I do not play a paladin because of the wepons or UBER abilities or weapons that they may or may not get.  <P>it just seems to me that VI does not put any thought into what they do.  They give Paladins, by far, the most drawn out and involved quests.  Which is a good thing.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  <P>It's just that FV, by a majority of people, is seen as the weapon that defines the Paladin.  As for Kunark, I personally have not been there with my paladin.  But I have heard through others, and correct me if I am incorrect.  That there is only one paladin-only weapon available through Kunark. <P>If the intent was to get other classes a "epic" quest and a weapon to go along with it. (or anything for that matter) all the better.  But I still feel that it once again proves that VI has screwed the Paladin and that as paladins we once again become the red-headed step child of the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I'm sorry - but I think it's time for a wakeup call. I don't know where you get the idea that Paladins are "red headed" step children. Before you make statements such as those - you should make sure you have ALL the facts.<P>If you want to see "red headed" why not take a look at other classes. Here's 2 common ones for example:<P>SK - Took over 1 year to get any positive changes done to them. They consistantly had pets nerfed, spells pulled, and mana costs upped on them, with little warning, and no reasoning behind the changes; not to mention the fact that there's tell tale signs that hybrid's in general are NOT balanced with pure classes as a whole.<P>Rogue - The single non RP reason for playing one was the poison skill, which for the longest time was broke, and had to be fixed via a complete skill revamp. They have a find/detect and disarm trap skill - which is totally useless as there's no real traps in game save pit traps in some areas.<P>In short, those are but 2 good examples. I can contine on and on about this, but what would be the point?<P>I've played EVERY - that's right EVERY class (but not every racial combination) ingame to at least level 5 (excluding Iks) and paladins are by far no where near what you claim them to be.<P>Heck - if you look at it - even with the addition of Kunark, the FA Epic Quests, and various other skills etc. that have been added in, Paladins STILL get some of the most powerful gear in the game pretty easily.<P>I personally think you've just got a case of class envy, and that you want your Paladin to be an uber class. I'm sorry - but NO ONE class deserves to be the uber class. We all have our benefits/drawbacks - we just need to learn to live with them and find how to work with/around them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>"Fact Paladins were the most quest give class. over the time of eq we have been water down beyond<BR>belief. the last thing we clung to was our quests."<P>Not True. Please provide facts and argue the point. This is complete suppisition and and false.<P>"Tell me true do u honestly think rogues who are not known for the degree of dificulty quests that paladins are should be able to quest their defineing weapon in shorter time then it took paladins for an equaly stat quest weapon?"<P>I think you just answered you own question. Paladins are known for their quest. They are known for having dynamic and complicated quest. They are congradulated and given more honor for completing their complicated quest. So unless, you want paladins to lose prestigue in the quest department, rogue quest should not be as difficult at paladin quest. But as for me, it does not matter which is more difficult, paladins or rogues. I guess you would be happy only if no one but paladins had quest.<P>"Fact rogues are great damage dealers and you should have your poisons' damage increased"<P>And may I ask, what does this have to do with the topic being discussed. This is so way off topic it should not be here.<P>"Fact there should be two classes with the BEST FA QUESTS Paladin and Shadow Knights"<P>Pure and simple class greed at its finest. I guess I was correct in my belief that you wish that other class should not even have any quests. FYI, this is Everquest, not LordSoulbreach's Dream.<P>"In endgame at lvl 60 paladins and sk should be the only two winners in duals. all casters should be able to flee the battle sceane..."<P>Pure and simple class greed at its finest. Why should it be a must that paladins and shadowknights win all duals at level 60? What is it that gives them the right to be the Uber-class? Again, this is Everquest (or Necroquest), not your fantisy game.<P>"i see lots of raven scale and crafted and ivory but i see very very few ro amored knights &lt;i know since kunark there..."<P>First off, it is Ivy not Ivory. Second, if you do not see Ro armor it is because you are not looking. Paladins do have Ro armor. I helped many level 30 paladins get the pieces that they wanted back when I was level 30. If you are not seeing Ro armor it is because you are not looking for it on others. It may also be the case that you really did not notice since Ro armor looks a lot like steel. But either case is because you are blind to the reality of the situation. Fact, Ro armor is a bit more difficult then the other class specific armor. Fact, Ro armor is NOT impossible to get. Fact, many paladins do have Ro armor. Those are the facts, not fiction like what you were mentioning.<P>"btw i'd like to see two new spells for lvl 40+ sk n paladins i'd like paladins"<P>Why?<P><BR>-Wadin Pureheart of Quellious<BR>Ranger, 52 summers<BR>Bootleggers Guild Master</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

If some one has a harder quest to do then plane and simple that class should have a greater reward n not just "wow u went through alot of crap just to get the same thing so n so got in less time and effort" <BR>.. i.e.  paladin/rogue  paladin quest is harder and do to him not cheating or looking for the easy way in life but rather the right way of life his weapon should be better but a longer quest (perhaps this is what verant has done but right now it is not so) the rogue should have a shorter quest for tis the rogues way of life to look for the easy way in life. but the rogue weapon should be a LESSER WEAPON THEN THE PALADIN.  <BR>.<BR>.as for my opnion on the end game duals it is not out of greed &lt;my 51 lvl necro is higher then the paladin n i'm not asking her to be the winner&gt; but rather out of fantasy edicate.  the end winners in fantasy as far as duals go has always always been the paladins and the shadow knights.  now since some one will say "it's not a wizards desire to dual"  bs it seems tome every evil caster wanted to kill the good paladin and every evil caster feared the paladin.<BR>.<BR>.examples of evil casters and sk/paladins duals.<BR>.<BR>...star wars emporer and vader who won?<BR>.<BR>...merlin's evil son and king arthur were the ones who died in the last war but merlin and his ex-lover were either killed or vanquished or left befoe the end from great batle scars.   <BR>.<BR>...robin hood robin hood and the evil sherif were the two deadly ones and the witch was killed by a knight.  <BR>.<BR>...the list goes on n on if i was to enter d&d books and other fantasy books.  casters are great in wars but in duals they do not stand up to a tank.  sorry guys but it seems even conan the barbarian killed every evil caster he ran into and yes they seemed to have more power then he did.  sorry i knew a;lll the nerds want the caster who relies on their brains to beat the dumb old tank but all and all tanks win in end game in fantasy.   <BR>.<BR>.one last word.  paladins do have the hardest quests in game bar none.  this isn't just my opinion it's the truth u add up every step needed to finish any other class armor and weapon quest and u compare it to what a paladin needs to do for his ro armor and his fiery avenger quest and u will see the paladin wins hands down of more steps and time needed.   so ya since we have the hardest quests we should have the best items given r our personal stats should increase i.e. our wisdom and other stats to to our constent life leasons learned in our quests.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Wadin ...Long bow men?<P>Hmm, ok. To a certain extent this can be considered remotely true, but your history is a little out. I don't know which historical period you are talking about, but i'll start with Romans. Long bow men? *cough*<BR>Crusades .. long bow men? *cough*<BR>Napoleonic .. fair enough<BR>Imperialism .. long bow men? weren't they shooting at this stage?<P>I don't know one single battle conducted during the period that bowmen, using long bows over their shorter crossbow partners, where Knights in full plate didn't outweigh the mortality rate of the enemies troops. Sure bow men had their uses, but beyond being pounded into the ground and having their bow string fingers cut off, they really didn't do as much damage to the opposing troops as you seem to think. You seem to forget that by the time men starting wearing full plate, bowmen weren't using long bows, but shorter stouter versions and even with the reach and therefore acceleration of the arrow from a long bow, the impact on ground troops, be they pikemen or knights, or somesuch, was minimal.<P>I am sure there were huge impacts made by bowmen, but historically I think you'll find the Pics/Celts actually did more damage per man than any weapon used  = )<P>Thx info<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Varrioth, you may want to check you history again with regards to bowmen. But that is all besides the point. The true point of my post is that LordSoulbreach believes that paladins and shadowknights should be the Super-class. He believes that because Dark Vader took out the Emperior in Star Wars, that paladins and shadowknights in EQ should win every battle. Are you attempting to suggest to me that you believe the same thing. <P>For every fantisy that a person can name where a paladin/shadowknight character is the tough central role, I can name you one where another class style was designed as better. I can name you one that the paladin/shadowknight character was a whip and traitor. It is stupid of us to think that because we can name movies and fantisy things like Star Wars and believe that justifies the argument that paladins and shadowknights should be a Super-class. The stupidity of nature of my comment on historical accounts of bowmen is in that same nature.<P>-Wadin Pureheart of Quellious<BR>Ranger, 52 summers<BR>Bootleggers Guild Master<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Wadin - I still think i'm right with regards Bowmen but as you said that's beside the point.<P>From an AD&D point of view, Paladins should be the strongest ubber melee class out there. BUT this isn't AD&D. I think people are right in saying Paladins are pretty much the joke of Everquest but I play a Paladin and it's not THAT bad. I mean you get constantly reamed with quests, items not being made available at the same time as other classes, quest items not being implemented etc.. The fact that we're not really 3/4 , 1/4 anything. Pathetic cleric spells and melee output. However in the way Verant wanted the Paladin we are 100% on the ball.<BR>I guess I could write and argue all day long that Paladins need this, and Paladins need that. Bottom line is, they are not ever going to be in line with any others classes. I've learnt to enjoy my character (fnar, fnar) and come to terms with the fact Verant won't address the issues with the class. It's all swings and roundabouts.<P>V</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Varrioth, I agree with you that the paladin class has problems and issues that could be resolved. I will never denign that. I just do not believe that the paladin class should be better then every other class in the game. That was the premiss behind my original and follow up post. There are some people (not exclussive to the paladin class) that believe that a specific class should be an all powerful class. I believe if you want something like that, go play Diablo or AC where there is things like that. I believe that each class should have a set of strengths and weaknesses. And that these strengths and weaknesses should be balanced with other classes strength and weaknesses.<P>On the topic of paladin quest, that really is a double edged sword. There are some people that want to have complicated and involved quest to complete. They enjoy that type of play. But if you make a quest involved and complicated, you make it "hard". Furthermore, you make that class have a level shift in its completion of quest. The harder a quest is, more of the level shift that occurs in completing it. The paladin class is known for its involved and complicated quest. This gives it both the advantages and disadvantages that such quest entail. Really, can you tell me that people do not give more respect to a paladin that has obtained a set of Ro armor then they do to a ranger that has obtained a set of Ivy. Everyone says that Ivy quest is a joke (although it is not the easiest of the class armors) which leads to few people respecting rangers that have a set of it. But show me a paladin with a full set of Ro, I will show you a person that is envied and believed to be a very good player by others. It is a Catch-22 situation.<P>-Wadin Pureheart of Quellious<BR>Ranger, 52 summers<BR>Bootleggers Guild Master<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The battles you are thinking of are Crecy, Agincourt and Poitiers.<P>In Agincourt the battle was swung in favour of the english because the French had idiotic commanders and tactics because they sent waves of heavy cavalry into a virtual bog where they all got mired down and thus were easy targets for the English longbowmen who, although they were half-starved, diseased, and small in numbers still thumped the French knights all the way to Paris and back.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Tryst : Aye I believe that's pretty much the three battles that spring to mind. Funniest being the english finger gesture for F*** you having come from the taunts of the english bowmen who had had some of their troops captured by the french to subsequently have those two fingers removed. &lt;-- digression<P>Wadin : Yes friend, it's very true. Our quests are definately quite complex and as such I do believe people show some respect to the achievements. The Silent watch shield quest took me 50+ hours on it's own. = )<P>There is the 'Verant orginial statement' policy which is where I believe gdwallace made his comments from, however as games move through development stages it's obvious that some things aren't going to be pushed through as promised. Sure people can get upset we didn't have our quest spell for (what was it ... 4, 3 months?) ages, FA wasn't implemented etc... you can beat your head against a wall for pretty much every single bad aspect in life.<P>Sure there are issues with our class. Someday they might get addressed, they might not. As a Paladin though most players will respect you continuing to trudge through because the class is hard to play. That is not to say it's harder than any other, etc... As far as i've seen all the class have lesser and better points to them. Paladins have gone towards the defense side much more than some might have liked, that's our jobs as we are now. High AC, lots of healing. <P>Not everyone is going to be happy though, that's just life.<P>Hooray the Hybrids!<P>V</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000225&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000225&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
