</FONT><HR>I just want to say let trolls and ogres use the imbued granite pauldrons.  I don't understand why we can't use it.  Our penalties lie our exp penalty, our huge size, the horrible faction, and I know the trolls have a very low base fire resist.  What the races get for these negatives are higher stats, trolls have regen(which doesn't do much at higher lvls), and ogres can't be stunned from the front.  Studies have shown stats don't have any drastic effects for warriors.  It seems fair to me.  Then you say we can't use the pauldrons because we have higher stats.  So take away our exp penalty then  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">   I know this is old news but my warrior is new, didn't realize how important it was. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The defeinsive discipline is way too overpwoering in its current state. It does more to make Warrior required on high end encounters then nearly any of skill or ability. You're already nerfing donals bp on the basis that they should not be required to do encoutners. However, a Warrior using defensive is also currently a requirement. No one does high end fights without that as a basis. Even if the discipline was found to be fair, the timing on it is fo far ahead of anything either of the other 2 pure melee's get. Its a common statement amount warriors that there is only 1 discipline. Surely this wa not your intent when creating it?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Increase the range of taunt. Maybe dubble it's current range or at least increase it by half. it's very frustrating to have a mob move out of taunt range so easy.<P>AE taunt is a good idea.<P>Please ignore the idea to move our 56 disc to 59. We already have to wait 3 lvl's longer then monks and rogues to get it.<P>Put kick and bash on seperate delays. I have never understood why they are on the same. Neither can do much dmg and they are slow to refresh anyway. This would also help offset the dmg output we lose for using a shield.<P>Move the stun with kick to 51. I don't see why we don't get it till mid 50's. Is it that powerfull? Does it stun every time a kick is landed? I doubt it.<P>Disarm. It's a nice idea but has little use outside of pvp or duels. In pvp or a duel it actually reduces the effectiveness of who you are fighting. If a mob is using a slow weapon/2h and I disarm it then I have just increased it's effectiveness against me and my group. Because a mob doesn't need a weapon to be effective it makes the skill near useless. And caster mobs don't need spells to kill you. Why is it caster mobs are able to melee for as much dmg as non caster mobs?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Any plans on adding crossbows to this game?<P>Casters can hit targets regardless of where they are - above, below, partially obscured.<P>Would like archery/throwing fixed so that targets above or below the bowman can be hit.<P>Also, if targets are paritially obscured by a rock, a hill crest, whatever - seems that archery fails 100%.<P>Why are throwing weapons so darn expensive?<BR>It's cheaper to use a bow.<BR>If I threw an axe at something and killed it - why can't I just go over there and pick my axe up?<BR>Please have throwing weapons return to the owner automatically with a percentage chance that the weapon is damaged or is lost.<P>After about level 40, why would any warrior use a 2H weapon? <P>I know damage for 2H weapons was recently adjusted, however they still suck. <P>When I have to kill something fast - which is always the mode I'm in, I switch to dual wield. It also taunts better than 2H off the casters.<P>I would recommend that when 2 handers crit, they do triple or quad damage. They don't crit that often because of the infrequency of the swings. But when they land - they should really hurt!<P>And the game is also lacking in decent high level shields.<P>There's no point in using a 1h weapon and shield at higher levels - the amount of kill power one looses for the pitiful amount of AC gained - isn't worth it. <P>A shield should have higher AC than a breast plate!<P>Bash and slam are worthless skills - they hardly ever work to interrupt the caster.<P>Bash takes forever to raise in skill.<P>Disarm - another useless skill - the damage the mob inflicts after loosing its weapon is not even perceptable! And not all weapons can be disarmed.<P>Warriors should get bonuses to crafting armor and weapons. Why? Because they use them, they should know better than a book-read Wizard. Wizards should get bonuses for making pots, skewers and lanterns.<P>Instead of disarm or bash - warriors should get a STUN ability. After all Mobs (esp skeletons) stun when they hit hard. <P>Casters get spell specialization?<BR>How about adding a specialization for piercing, 1HS, 2HS, 1HB, and 2HB<P>The higher the speciality the greater the attack skill and damage done and a greater chance of crits.<P>The only problem with this idea - warriors would select the same category as their epic weapons<P>So add an epic weapon for each category.<P>In fact each class should have multiple epci weapons - some of them should be religion and race based!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>if you take away invis from warrior armor (cobalt legs and incarnadine breastplate) I will be TRULY disappointed.  Both of those items are very hard to obtain and it makes it so much worth it just having the invis effect because I hate having to bug a wizard or someone for an invis just so I can run through kael to get to skyshrine or somewhere.  You might as well make invis potions all except warriors/ all if you are going to go this route.  I dumped so much plat on invis potions...and got so sick of carrying 15 non stackable invis potions around everywhere i went that i jumped for joy when i finally got an item where i didnt have to worry about taking up all my inventory and plat just for some freakin potions, or bugging ppl for invises everywhere i went.  Its not like it makes us fight better since we can invis if were lucky enuff to have one of these items.  It doesnt make warriors too powerfull, it just makes it a little easier for us to get around in some places where we would have to rely on other classes to get us where we need to be. I will be truly heartbroken  along with alot of other warriors if you go through with it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The halfling that was going on about how great warriors are and how easy high end gear is to get HAS to be the high warrior in some uberguild.  Now, I'm sure we all would like to sit at the cool table, but I'm not going to sell out and join a kill-stealing, regular player bullying, GM-favored uberguild.  The warrior gear is HARD to get.  Warriors NEED help, and often the help doesnt NEED us back!<P>As the power/damage/hp of mobs increases exponentially at higher levels, the differences between warriors and hybrids become irrelevant and therefore unbalancing.  Warriors need more hp, more ac, and EITHER a better taunt or change the primary hand level-based damage bonus to a percentage increase instead of a flat numeric bonus.  That way a higher delay weapon would have more of a level-based damage bonus than the light, fast weapons.  (Actually that would irritate a lot of warriors since all weapons would be effected.  So nevermind that part, and just boost the taunt.)  When the mobs hit for 300 and have 10k hp, the benefits warriors enjoy become meaningless - so why be a warrior when you could be a 95% warrior with spells?  Therefore the benefits warriors normally enjoy need to be tweaked up at high levels.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hello, <BR>  I am lvl 58 ogre warrior on Tunare. I just like to add I do use a two hand weapon. I love the idea of using a shield with it or placing our Fear shield on our back. Atleast I use it rather than taking up space in my bank. <P>My taunting methods: <BR>  If Enchanter cast mez taunt 2 or 3 times before I break mez. Shaman cast slow during fight prey I can taunt of it or someone else does. Maybe taunt needs to be raised I dont know maybe not.<P>zone movement. We really have hard time hear inless we have someone to help, invis item or potion. We are very dependent class.<P>Items: live and die and consider ubber or non ubber by them. Like no other class our strength lies in items. All our strength lies in them as well as abilities. We fight amongst our friends who are also warriors to attain anything that will aid us in becoming a better warrior. I have seen cobalt bracer go for cof, jade mace, idol of thorned, etc.  Is the vision of Verant to have only several players to be equipped with cobalt? However, I do like the new plane of growth armor looks awesome and comparable stats. However, like all planes I hear there is 10 warriors there scrapping of the crumbs also. Even when there is 2 or 3 we warriors shreak at the sight of another warrior. Regardless if there our friends or not. Why shouldnt we? We are the begger class :P. Think about it sec  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>I also agree that our epic items should be 100% drop. It is very difficult to muster these groups one, succeed at these ubber mobs two, decide which ubber warrior will get the item.<P>Triple attack at lvl 60 sounds great.<P>Also as a ogre I don't use slam any more because kick does the same and I can be in dark elf form without the size issue. I know ogre do take a experience penality, but I dont know how it compares to other warriors. I heard that we get the ability to not be stun from the front but as a dark elf who looses my ogre abilities I don't get stun from the front either (In dark elf form I cannot bash so I presume polymorphism because my size is no longer an issue also rather than an illusion). Also talking to other barbarian, human, etc warrior that stun ability really only helps at low levels I hear because they hardly get stun in the front as well. If you see me I 100% of the time play my de form using ogre stats.<P>I also like the idea of cobalt gauntlets producing arrows, or throwing daggers whatever rather than a berserker strength which conflicts with our boots.<P>I think berserk mode should not loose points in agility regardless of what hitpoints you have because your adrenalin has hit the roof. To compensate maybe make it where we can not flee and allow us to produce 1 and a half the damage we normally would. Maybe that would be to unbalincing? <P>I like the idea of finding rare scrolls that give us and all melees new skills. Thusly we are not so dependent on items. Just my thoughts, i love my warrior and enjoy playing him. However there has to be more in the game then log on. get group hopefully, pull, taunt, kick, taunt, kick sleep wake up next pull :P<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Maybee raise it 5 or ten points for ALL levels. WArriors are supposed to be the ones that soak up the damage, whell when they can't pull a mob off a wizerd that takes away half of the warriors job.<P>A battle cry would be nice, doesn't have to be a spell, Maybee take of stamina. could increase str, dex, agi, con and Mresist a bit.<P>2 thing that does get me about my class is this.<P>Strength and constitution do very little. I read the whole "magick number" thing that someone wroght up and it's true ( wariors constintly hit between two numbers called magick numbers regardless of any str modifiers, you only hit for more some times, and tehn it's just 6 or so damage more). a long story short, str does not help our average damage much (same goes for the other meelee classes).<P>I'm a troll and I'm very dishearted when I do the same amount of damage as a hafling of my level. Make it so that our massive str does something.<P>Also constitution. as a troll I have Maybee 30 hp more than a human of my level (30th). thats 40 more constitution points and I only get a couple of more hp. Make constitution do more, More hp, better saving throws, something.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Although the following post is about hybrids, it addresses the inherent balance issues in general for EverQuest.<P>The problem with warriors -vs- hybrids (not counting bards) is this:<P>If not a single hybrid showed up for an "uber" mob raid in Kunark, or even a non-uber raid in some of the high level Velious zones (and especially the ubers in Velious), the raid can and would still go on, the hybrids would not be missed (if the raid had the needed numbers) and in some encounters (Venril Sathir for example) the hybrids presence would actually HURT the raid, not help it.<P>If not a single warrior showed up for an "uber" mob raid in Kunark, or even a non-uber raid in some of the high level Velious zones (and expecially the ubers in Velious), the raid would not and COULD not continue (even IF the raid had the needed numbers), warriors of the appropriate levels would be solicited from other places by any means possible. No warriors, no raids.<P>This to me is unacceptable. HOW can this be considered 'balanced?' I'm not asking warriors' skills to be reduced. I'm asking hybrids skills, abilities and spells (our spells are difficult at BEST to "stick" to Kunark "boss" mobs or the 56+ mobs in Velious) to be increased so we can be a significant contribution to the raid. Yes, we DO want to be needed. Isn't that what we, as the PEOPLE behind the characters want in game and in real life? Knowing that our presence made a difference, that we helped the group and not hurt it is not only fun, it is very gratifying.<P>For one class of a particular type (fighter/tank/melee or whatever you wanna call us) to be needed EXCLUSIVELY over ALL of the others is very imbalanced.<P>As an analogy, take Diablo II (granted, that is MUCH more of a single player game, but the analogy still applies). Each character class in that game adds their own unique skills and abilities to the game, each would be able to defeat the final "boss" mob on their own, but as a group they would be much more effective, each adding skills the others don't have.<P>Now I'm not asking for each class to have the power and ability to solo boss mobs (or even solo for that matter). For EQ to be a "grouping" game, class interdependency is needed. However, reading the "class talk" boards and hearing the complaints of other classes, and especially with the advent of Velious (mob level and hitpoint cap gone), the only classes that are truly NEEDED are clerics and warriors. And although the other classes do add utility and needed skills, if either one or both of those two "core" classes do not show up for a "raid," the raid wouldn't happen. If one of any other class didn't show up, the raid could still continue. THAT is the fundamental problem with EQ and why many people are losing interest with a particular class or with EverQuest itself. <P>No one wants to be a burden. (well, maybe some people do . . .) But I know I don't. But until I'm given the proper tools, I'll continue to be a burden. This, Verant, I request be changed. How? I don't know. It's your game, you designed it, you control it, you need to decide and implement this change. Otherwise, what are we paying you for?<P>- Vorrek, 52 SK, Quellious<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, well I just wanted to make a comment about your persistant remarks about wanting invis removed from the warrior armor. In EVERY city that has a potions vendor you can buy invisibility potions for very cheap (cheap to a warrior that would be of level to get cobalt legs). So we dont get anything new with the legs except not having to go through the added downtime of going to town. Having a shielding or str buff on armor seems more out of line than invis to me because that is something totally new. If you remove the effect, one of which cannot possibly be an issue of game balance but rather seems to just be a peave of yours, warriors will still be able to invis themselves unless you nerf everyone else as well and remove these potions. <P>So, all you are doing is creating even MORE downtime. This is something that I thought was being decreased, not intentionally increased for no reason, other than, someone not liking it who just happens to have some influence. <P>The invis potions have been on the Grobb vendor for over a year (before Kunark) and invis was never a game balancing issue before. So why is it a game balancing issue now? If it isnt about balance then why are you mentioning it in the balance thread?  I thought you guys liked to stay on topic. Or are you just trying to goat the warriors? <P>If you are looking for some ideas on what kinds of spells to put on armor then make them spells that decrease downtime, like invis and shrink, and take away the buffs, which honestly do not fit a warrior. Examples are items that make food and drink, make ranged ammo, make some form of pouch that will at the minimum deposit coin in the bank or make it wieghtless, invis and IVU items, shrink items for SK's.<P>Invis being the effect on an item handles the issue of decreasing downtime and not to the point that upsets game balance.<P>On the topic of doing something different with going bezerker, ummm  the suggestions that were made stink and so please just leave that as is. Maybe it should last longer after you get healed but please dont make it into a disc. I would think that at lvl 60 it would be neat if the warrior got a rare chance of flat out killing the target if a crippling blow landed, similar to a rogues assassinate, but only when in bezerker and even then happen more rare than the rogue. Also replace the lvl 60 disc with one that makes your weapon proc on every hit. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Warrior hp/ac certainly doesn't need tweaking.<P>Monks are reaching 4500hp pretty much max. Warriors can max out at near 6k. If that difference isn't enough for you, I dunno what would be. Yes monks can reach comparable ac to warriors, but even with uber buffs the hp difference is huge. Realize that the 1500hp difference gets higher in percentage the less hp buffs you have up.<P>Warriors are one of the most powerful classes as it is, the only very legimate gripe imho are the drop rates for some of the epic drops. *** is up with the Queen not dropping a blade every time?<P>AoE taunt might not be bad, but its only a minor enhancement anyway so doesn't really touch balance issues. Also not having it lets you see the great warriors (who'll have every mob on them even without aoe taunt) from the average ones.<P>-- Delheru Tanreall<BR>Avatars of Discord, Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

This means you would finally see a difference between a big fat sturdy Ogre warrior and a flimsy but nimbel Halfling.<P>Although Hobbits and Trolls should really be different beasts, it currently all boils down to a tradeoff of a few hundred hp in exchange for faster leveling and different faction in EQ.<P>Ogre warriors should live on their hit points while gnomes and halflings rely on not getting hit in the first place.<P>Pros:<BR>Some kind of "specialisation" would be possible, e.g. Ogres and Trolls with massive hit points would be perfect caster killers, taking harmtouches and ice comets without problems while the shorties could shine when a pack of 6 blue melee mobs aggros on them.<P>Shaman buffs for dex and agi would become useful and wanted. <P>Cons:<BR>A lot of work for the programmers to make stats and stat buffs meaningful and even more work to balance this meaningfulnes inside the warrior class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Leave berzerk and taunt alone, but have a taunt discipline that lasts for a given amount of time which aggro's ANY NPC within it's range on you, NO MATTER WHAT, and it stays on you for the duration of the discipline.  On top of this, whether the NPC is normally capable of becoming enraged, it becomes enraged and hits harder/faster than normal.<P>What you think?<P>-Desbarolis -- 46th bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>Okay, i have to admit that i haven't read everything on this topic so far, but i have read quite a few things i like<P>i like the idea of having a stun button, i would rather have a stun button that is 3 times slower than kick, or slam than kick or slam themselves.<P>i would like to have berserker frenzy on a button, similar to lay of hands.  I hate having it only be triggered when i am practically dead, i can't think of a single time that it has helped.<P>i would like an increased resistance to stun, i think warriors would know how to take a hit better than other classes.<P>i think the higher ac on shields would be a good idea.  shields are usually known to be made thicker than most other pieces of armor, and are built to protect a wider portion of the body.<P>I saw someone mention Warriors should have a bonus in blacksmithing to making weapons and armor.  it sounds like a good idea to me, maybe make it something like followers of Rallos Zek are better at making weapons, and followers of Mithaniel Marr are better at making armor. something along those lines, and also making strength play a bigger part in blacksmithing, i mean, i think an ogre warrior could pound on the steel with his hammer quite a bit harder than a gnome enchanter.<P>I also think you should be able to bind wound up to 100% or at least close to it, even at level 1.  it is a big enough penalty that it is ten times slower than casting, but you also have to carry around 10 stacks of bandages if you want to stay anywhere for a while anyway.  Maybe you could also add a penalty like mend wound, where there is the potential to hurt yourself more on occasion<P>i also think you need to improve your consider system.  it is a bit ridiculous that a griffawn that cons green to me can kick my ass.  and even if i do manage to beat it, i don't get jack for exp because he is green. how stupid is that?  Whereas my brothers druid has been befriending the griffawns and abusing the heck out of em because they con way lower than they should, they can take out every non-griff common red spawns in the zone without breakin a sweat.  he has gained 5 levels there in what would be 2 full days of playing, maybe.  I would love to be able to solo something and get decent exp.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>(1)Cobalt is way too rare.  Or, on the other hand, the other class-specific is way too common.  On E'ci for example, its getting more and more common to see bards of *any* level wearing at least a pair of SS Boots.<BR>Heck, just tonight in EC before I logged for the evening, I saw the following /auctions:<P>Selling SS Boots (Bard Only) 2k<BR>WTB Cobalt Vambs, Paying/Trading 20k in pp,items<P>Talk about screwed up.  Not only is cobalt rare to begin with, but with the insanely sparse drop rates, its lucratice to camp every cobalt-bearing mob there is.  Whats that mean? Warriors are having a real hard time trying to obtain their armor over others trying to make some *great cash*.  Now, before you say it, I will agree with you that the rarer it is, the better the item is / more impressive it is / etc.  But damn, why are warriors singled out amongst the melees to be the poster children for Excedrin Headaches over class-specific dropped armor?  Simple solutions...either increase drop rates, or decrease drop rates on other class-specific armor.<P>Oh look, another Cleric with Donal's gear.<P>(2)The Epic Weapon - Yikes.  I see a great deal of Shaman with the Spear of Fate, Chanters with their epic weap (forget name offhand), Rangers with theirs, etc.  Just curious...but why is ours so dang hard? Ya, not everybody should have one.  And ya, of course, the quest should be challenging and rewarding.  Maybe some things could be adjusted? Not sure.

</FONT><HR>I play a lvl 37 Iksar warrior on the Karana server, and noticed that my kick & dodge skills have not gone up at all since lvl 29/30. I tried spending my practice points at the guild master in Cabilis, and I got a message saying that those two skills are already maxed although I haven't seen them go up at all during fights in the last 7 or 8 levels. My other skills (offense, defense, riposte, parry, etc.) have been working just fine, though.<P>I'm just wondering if it's supposed to be this way, but I doubt it since I don't recall reading anything about this. I hope this is not a bug, but if it really is...it needs to be fixed soon.<P>Btw...I also agree that the effectiveness of Taunt needs to be improved. This problem doesn't just happen post lvl 50, but also happen to warriors in their 30's. There have been numerous times when I had difficulties in taunting the mobs away off a monk group mate.<P>Another thing I would like to see is the availabitlity of more armor pieces that are wearable by Iksar warriors.<P>And finally, I think it would be really nice if there are more places where melee classes can be bound. The reason for this is that there are times when druids/wizards in the zone you're bound in are too busy camping/hunting, and don't want to be bothered with TP requests.<P>Besides those things I mentioned above, I think the warrior is a pretty well defined class. That's my 2cp. Thanks.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor said "Actually, even if knights had exactly the same armor class and defensive skills as a warrior, they would be worse tanks, since they have noticeably fewer hit points. As I said earlier, improving warriors would almost by default mean an improvement in those other classes, so that the gap would not close. If we choose to close the gap, then warriors will have to remain where they are. I'm certainly not going to advocate an increase in warrior power _just_ so we can give more power to the hybrids. That seems sorta backward to me."<P>I wanted to look at some hard numbers, so I went to Caster's Realm and sampled from their player's database.  I recorded the hitpoints of ten random (legitimate looking characters as opposed to made up sounding ones like Thisserversux) players from each of the plate wearing melee classes.  All characters were level 60 and the hps listed included equipment bonuses.  Here are the average hps of each class from the samples:<P>Paladin - 2343<BR>Shadowknight - 2412<BR>Warrior - 2909<P>Since Warriors have been named the base class, I'll use their hps as the standard here.  Unbuffed, the percentages are as follows:<P>Paladins - 80 percent of warrior<BR>Shadowknight - 83 percent of warrior<P>These percentages seem proper to me.  However, I think it would be a mistake to a judgement on these numbers.  We need to factor in buffs still.  At the endgame, level 60, the following buffs are standard on tanks:<P>Symbol of Marzin - 700hps<BR>Heroism - 400hps<BR>Talisman of Kragg - 380hps<BR>Riotous Health - 300hps (from +50 stamina)<BR>Divine Strength - 200hps<P>Now let's buff our tanks and look at the numbers again:<P>Paladin - 4323 hps<BR>Shadowknight - 4392 hps<BR>Warrior - 4889 hps<P>Percentages:<P>Paladin - 88 percent of warrior<BR>Shadowknight - 90 percent of a warrior<P>Note how the warrior still has the same number of hps more than the others before and after buffs, yet the effective balance has changed.<P>For starters, 500hps is not a terribly large advantage in the first place.  That's less than one hit from Ixiblat Fer, two third of a hit from Treah Greenroot and two hits from Prince Thirneg.  So a warrior's claim to fame, that of more hitpoints, can be negated in a split second by any number of mob encuonters. But this is nothing new, this situation has existed since the last time either of the classes had hp modifications.<P>I wanted to point these numbers to help discourage hp increases for paladins and shadowknights.  The gap between us really isn't much at all, and closing that gap would be a major blow to the warrior class. <P>I am especially concerned by Absor's comment "If we choose to close the gap, then warriors will have to remain where they are."  If I read this right, then a hybrid hp increase would not be followed by a warrior increase.  Suppose that increase were 150hps. The new totals would be:<P>Paladin - 2493 unbuffed (86 percent warrior), 4473 buffed (92 percent)<P>Shadowknights - 2562 unbuffed (88 percent warrior), 4542 buffed (93 percent warrior)<P>The primary advantage a warrior has in melee combat is hitpoints.  AC is rumored to have a softcap of 1100, which is easily obtained and exceeded by all three classes, so the warrior will not exceed in that area.  Damage output would still be somewhat better for a warrior, but I don't know of a way to bring this data to light.<P>So where does this leave the warrior?<P>HPs only slightly better than other plate classes.<BR>AC equal.<BR>Damage slightly better.<P>Now the questions arise.  Are these melee benefits worth passing up on the myriad of spells and skills a hybrid has to offer?  I don't think they would be.  There would be no underlying reason to play a warrior, and that would be a violation of class balance.<P>I apologize to drag this out, and I will admit the averages were not from a proper statistical sampling, but I think they're accurate enough for this purpose.<P>I hope these numbers and opinions help.<P>Coffinn Unforgiven<BR>lvl 59 Dark Elf Warrior<BR>Sol Invictus<BR>Tribunal<P>Bombastic P.

</FONT><HR>Hello,<P><BR>SHIELDS - please, there has been numerous inputs on the use of the shield, but still (at least in the first reply from Absor) it hasn't been noted by Verant people. Some nice ideas have been something like <P>a) Make most of the shield BACK wearable for warriors <P>b) Add block or similiar skill for using shield and thus making it effect a lot more (hybrids would like this too) <P>c) Make shield ACs waaaaaay bigger, if all else is too 'difficult' <P>d) Give shield new stats like +parry/+defense <P>e) Make parry skill take inpupt as how much the user of the shield wants to concentrate on parrying (without shield the parrying would be the same as now). If the user want to concentrate on parrying (with shield) for 100% this would mean maybe double the parrying chance than without shield? But would off course affect attacking abilities some (well allready does, by letting wield only one weapon). This would introduce new defensive warriors, that don't worry that much about not being cool and deliver huge damage. This idea woulnd't work too well without upping taunt ability off course...<P>SHIELDS - I want to see them made somewhat more useful. That's it.<P>Tguk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
