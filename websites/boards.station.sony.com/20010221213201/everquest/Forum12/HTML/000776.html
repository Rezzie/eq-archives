&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>About these lists:<P>First and foremost, understand that this is only a list of concerns to be brought to the Live Team.  This is not a list of promises, and I'm certainly not telling you that any or all of these items will be changed or implemented.<P>Also, there are three types of items that I don't have listed here.  Epic Quests, Magic Resistances in Velious and Mid-level quests.  Those three items were mentioned by enough classes that I've pulled them out for separate examination.<P>All items are currently marked with NONE for status.  Obviously we've already started working on some items, you've seen the lists from the patch messages on the Test Server.  I will be updating the status for items early next week to reflect those potential changes and with any responses from the team.  I just wanted to get these lists out to you fresh.<P>I want these lists to be final as you see them now, but I know there will need to be changes made.  So this list is not final.  But if you want something added to or removed from the list, please be convincing about the change.  At this point I don't want to tack on too many more items, since the team is already reviewing the original list.<P>Thanks for the input so far.<P>Alan<P>Magicians:<P>ITEM:  No Rent Items.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Recently the way players log back into the servers after disconnect was changed, and it affected magicians (not to mention people holding no rent quest items).  It would be nice to fix this by making No Rent items disappear on log-in instead of log-out, and only if the last log in time was more than 30 minutes prior.  Whatever the solution, Magicians are greatly inconvenienced by this change.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Rain Spells.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It seems that removing the pets from the equation would be the best way to make rain spells useful without making them too useful.  And it might also just eliminate the bug where some pets attack other PCs when they are caught in a rain or AoE spell.  It might also be a good idea to look at the resist rates on these spells, which seem to be higher than with most spells.  Some people would also like there to be one or two waves to these spell types.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Pathing.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Any continuing improvement on pathing would be a great benefit to magicians.  There are several places where the pathing, rather than the actual pet or the zone design intent, is bad enough to exclude the use of a pet.<P>STATUS:  None<P>Notes: Plane of Hate, Chardok, Nurga, the Hole, Old Sebilis, Trakanon’s Lair were the zones suggested.<P>---<P>ITEM:  Pets and AoE fear.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Pets are unwanted against any enemy that can cast an area of effect fear spell (and those are some of the more important encounters, at least emotionally), because the pet will always flee, and will often run directly into other monsters that the party does not want to engage.  It might be nice to give magicians the ability to make their pets immune to fear for short periods of time.  It could be debated about letting them make other pets immune to fear.  And it will most certainly be expected by the players that immunity to fear would make sense for necromancer pets than mage pets.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Voceration: Fire and Greater Voceration: Fire.<P>DESCRIPTION:  The claim is that these two pets do less damage than the level 29 fire pet.  Are they really less useful than the 29th level pet?<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Spell Drops.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Players believe that the 54th level Water Pet Spell (heck, all the 54th level pets) is dropping off the wrong level monsters.  There is a rumor that the water pet is dropping off of lower level mobs in Skyfire.  Is that really where it should drop?  Also, the Muzzle of Mardu is supposedly way too rare.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Pet Names.<P>DESCRIPTION:  How about letting players pick a pet name (just one per character) and have all of their pets named by that name.  It would be no more likely to be abused than the naming of characters, and it would make people with pets much happier.  Not to mention it would help diversify the landscape a bit.  Or, perhaps, have pets show up as &lt;Character&gt;’s Pet.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Pet Graphics.<P>How about a new graphic for high level magician and enchanter pets, something to match the spectre for the necros.  At least can we look into getting an interesting look for the epic magician pet?<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Rage of Zomm.<P>DESCRIPTION:  How about making it look like a big fat Eye of Zomm<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  DoTs.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Why give them DoT's with Velious?  It does seem a bit out of line.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Dyzil's Deafening Decoy.<P>DESCRIPTION:  The claim is that it doesn't actually decoy very well.  The ability for this pet to taunt could be increased.  There seems to be no reason that it can’t be a super taunter.  With its low hit points, letting it taunt the heck out of things wouldn’t seem to overpower it.  Though, if it’s going to be attacked so much perhaps more hit points would not be out of line.  Also, perhaps making it more of an escape spell would be a good idea.  Give it a very short casting time (2 seconds), so that magicians could summon it in bad situations real quick and then run like heck.  (Summary of requests for this spell:  A lot more taunt, more hit points, 2 second cast time).<P>STATUS:  None<BR> <BR>---<P>ITEM:  Higher level pet healing spell.<P>DESCRIPTION:  By giving them a better pet healing spell (a standard upgrade) at higher levels, they can decide if they want to heal or summon a new pet in a tight spot.  The last one they get is at 20th level, I think.  It’s a good spell line that really should be continued.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Improved Invisibility.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Why don’t magicians get this spell when all other Int casters do?<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Phantom Armor.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Two concerns here.  The first is that it uses 4 components!  That’s an awful lot of components to carry around.  It would be nice to make the component a single item that costs 4 (or even more) times as much.  The second concern is that it is overwritten by Shield of Words. It seems logical that the 52nd level personal magician spell should hold over the 49th level cleric spell.  Though the cleric spell seems to have more AC, the mage spell also gives additional regen…<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Robe of Conjuration.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Both necromancer and magician pantaloons (legs) for caster classes give them mana free level 50 pet buffs (Burnout III, Augment Death), but the necromancer robe has the level 57 Conjure corpse, while the Robe of Conjuration gives the level 49 damage shield.  How about changing the magician leggings to the level 56 damage shield?<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Pet Health Bars.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It would be nice if the magician could see his pet's health bar at all times.  Even better if every party member could see the health bars of all party pets.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Summoning text:<P>DESCRIPTION:  There is no text message when summoning magician pets.  Necromancers get a ‘rises from the dead’ emote.  How about something for magician pets, a different one for each type.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Magician Research.<P>DESCRIPTION:  Magician research is a little harsh compared to the others, with chain research and all.  Perhaps this could be changed a bit.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Pet SoW.<P>DESCRIPTION:  A spell to allow the pet to keep up with the master when he is moving fast.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Summoned Levitation Rings.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It seems that these rings don’t always report the right number of charges left, often saying that there is one left when there are none.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Summoned Staves.<P>DESCRIPTION:  It might be nice if more of them were one-handed.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Shard of the Core.<P>DESCRIPTION:  How about letting the item summoned by this spell be equipable in the ranged slot, like the Coldstones and Heatstones.<P>STATUS:  None<P>---<P>ITEM:  Aegis of Ro.<P>DESCRIPTION:  The players think that this spell is more than rare, that it is not dropping at all.  I've also been told by a very few players (one that I can think of) that it does indeed drop off a dragon in Dreadlands.<P>STATUS:  Spell scroll was never created.  It is now dropping.  Item fixed.<P>---<P>ITEM:  New Summoned Proc’ing Weapons.<P>DESCRIPTION:  With the recent changes to the status of pets (making them Pets instead of NPCs) and the fix to the way their weapons proc (and the ‘nerf’ of Sword of Runes) it should now be possible to add new proc’ing summoned weapons for Magicians.<P>STATUS:  N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>HURRAY!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>1) Don't get rid of DoTs just fix them (resists., mana costs and special effects?), too many folk do not understand how incredibly useful they are. Especially when engaging mutliple foes with no enchanter or unmezzable foes.<P>2) Fix the MONSTER SUMMONING spells, currently they are next to useless. Fun and that's all. Please make these spells:<BR>- Fast cast and with no reagent (3 sec max).<BR>- Summon a "standard" mob for that level, with mobs high damage and hit points, but the burnout and Renew Elements spells would have no effect on them since they are not elementals.<BR>- Chance to have a "special", such as a shaman, SK, rogue or wizard. They must NOT cast gate, AOEs or Dispels however. This would be incredibly fun and make the mage wanted in groups, but since these summoned pets would be lower level than the party, it would not threaten player classes standing.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Additionally:<BR>- Call of the Hero, please make this a level 50 spell, and introduce a lvl 55 variant that can summon a player across zones to the mage. That would make mages a desired class instead of one that is NEVER /shouted for to group.<P>- Summon Monster. A reverse sort of Monster Summoning. This would summon a random mob near the mage, basically causing a random spawn of any non-named or special mob within a set level range (blue to the caster). Give it a long recast time (3-5minutes?) so it isn't over used, this would help with camping since often you can't get to a safe place to play as they are taken, and with horrendous pulls. That is most parties do not have a ranger or monk to assist with pullling, this adds a new class to those who can help with pulling. The long recast stops the ordinary ways of pulling from being ignored, and since a random mob is summoned it makes it rather exciting...<P>"Mountain giant hillocks are easy!

The AoE was a big one...  i feel you only missed one gameplay one though..<P>The pet spells (more the earth elemental) are resisted an awful lot.  The earth elemental may as well just not cast, and add damage.  The root rarely sticks, and when it does, any damage to the mob breaks it.<P>Thanks, Absor!! =)<P>--Secias</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, you seem to have missed what I consider to be a very very important mage issue.<P>There is a rumor floating around which my experience seems to support that goes like this:<P>If a magician is soloing, and his pet does more than half the damage to the mob, the magician only gets 50% of the normal experience for the kill.<P>I've noticed that my experience gain seems to be no faster solo than it is partnered (on a per-kill basis) unless I nuke the mob heavily.  There is a very clear difference when I use a lot of mana on a solo kill.  Please please have someone look into this and either give us a difinitive 'No, this isn't happening, we did this test so we know' or fix it!<P>I feel the need to remind the good folk at Verant about the dual-wield bug, which they scoffed at until someone actually looked into it... it was a thorn in the Mage's side for ages.<P>Nemuneir Noldaron<BR>Elementalist from Ayonae Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Pet resistances:<BR>- Fire, air and water pets have resistances (to Fire, Cold and Poison respectively). But the Earth pet doesn't seem to have ANY resistances. Could you make it have high Magic resistamnce? Earth is durable, "magic flows off it", if you see what I mean. This gives us a pet good for certain mobs who employ Magic based attacks, like Grav Flux.<P>- I hear that the Epic Pet doesn't have the resistances of the ordinary pets, which is strange since its meant to be a combination of ALL the elements, so it shoudl be resistant to fire, cold, poison (and perhaps magic?)<P>Thanks for your time  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Thanks Absor!  Your list addresses none of the post 50 mage concerns.  Do you know I can count the number of post 50 mages on my server on both my hands.  And more than half have stopped playing them almost completely and have started twink rogues, warriors and monks.  Great job!  You haven't a clue about what our concerns are still or you simply don't care.  I play a 57 mage and I am useful to coth late raid members and to help kill the stupid AoE fire mob in CoM.  Any other raid and I have absolutely nothing to contribute.  Hey Absor for president!  Keep up the great work.  EQ will in the near future no longer have post 50 mages as a class since no one will play them.  Great way to destroy a class.  We have no identity post 50 and I can see that that will not change.

</FONT><HR>I agree that these are all issues, Absor, with the following changes:<P>PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE give us ONE additional pet command:<P>/pet no aggro (feel free to change the name of the command)<P>This would cause your pet to NOT ADD ANY MOBS TO ITS HATELIST unless you did /pet attack.  /pet attack would cause your pet to attack the mob you told it to, but if something else hit it, or hit you, the pet WOULD NOT AGGRO ON IT.  This would make our pets 1000% more desired on raids, where there would be no chance of them breaking mez on dangerous high-level mobs.<P>For this one change by itself, I would forgo ALL OTHER MAGICIAN BALANCE ISSUES.<P>Pets and AoE fear: Do not make the pets immune to fear.  Instead, when pets are feared, they should simply shut down -- i.e., stand still, stop attacking/casting, and do nothing until fear wears off, then they resume fighting.  The issue with AoE fear is that they run away and train things; this would eliminate that issue without making them too powerful (pets immune to fear = bring 20 mages on your raids, cause who needs tanks?)<P>- Teramenor<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hmmm, hmmm, well now.<P>Absor, sorry man, but you haven't listed any of the key concerns we wished added to your original list. Now, why is that?<P>Here's a bit o' a recap from my point of view:<P>1: stop giving out magician magick to other classes on various pieces of armor--you're hurting our chances for grouping here and violating the theme of this game (such as it is)<P>2: alter the levels of the silly Gift/Bundle series of post 50 spells to range 29 to 49 (or thereabouts). These spells were assigned bogus levels. Post 50 Magicians should have spells comparable in power and effectiveness to the other classes. Doh! Hint: summoning cake isn't a powerful spell; and, please, don't lapse into 'these spells are primarily for role-play' propoganda. Er, hello! EQ is NOT about role-play.<P>3: pet control! /pet no attack! or whatever. something that nullifies the bad pathing and the hair-trigger response to protect the Mage in precarious situations.<P>4: our promised proc'ing weapons!<P>5: change our staff summonings to 1hb and load them with spells or effects that will make any class want them---need not be unbalancing---but something to make them useful. <P>6: let us summon armor---a whole series of spells just for armor and armor that will actually be helpful to ourselves and others.<P>7: add CotH II that allows summoning of any player from any zone (well, except the Planes, I guess).<P>8: fix all the spell drops! They aren't happening like they should and they are dropping off of mobs too high in level. This is really a bad idea in the first place since you've forced us all to learn research.<P>9: Fix the DOTs that you're forcing us to use. Never mind the fact that we've never used anything like this before---but if you insist on forcing us to use Necro/Druid and Shammy magick, then at least make the spells worth the mana cost.<BR>Too high mana cost, too long cast time and the damage is ludicrous. <P>10: Give us a full range of elemental spells--not merely fire and earth(steel). You can't call us elementalists if we only use 2 elements.<P>11: Er, we want the AoE wave spells to ignore our pets, have lower resistance and to have one or two more waves if at all possible. Let them strike everything in the AoE. Balance it with mana cost and casting time if you need to.<P>12: More Mage specific Items and *gasp* items that are worth the effort and risk to get! Unique spells or summonings or even bonuses to summoning! Hint: reclaim energy isn't a unique spell and we already have many items that can cast it. And, if you insist on placing phantom armor spells on items, then make them cast with no reagent, please? come on...we've suffered enough carrying backpacks stuffed with cats eye around.<P>13: evidentally, you won't discuss the Epic Quest. Fine. I'll leave that one off.<P>I could go on, but I'll leave it at this list. I believe, Absor, that the LT can accomodate most of our wishes without skewing the balance of our class. Of course, I don't have the sheer data. I come up with ideas based on my interpretation of the 'theme' of the Magician class in this game. I realize that you have a real problem adding content that won't be exploited in a fashion you never intended---but I believe you CAN give us what we seek without this consequence.<P>What I find the most annoying of all, is your admonishment to refrain from asking for magick belonging to other classes when the LT purposefully designs ludicrous armor that steals most if not all of OUR magick. Who's idea was that, anyway?<P>Alcarian<BR>45 Mage<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This has got to be a tough job.  You just can't please everybody and no matter what you do someone is going to complain.  For example:<P>"1: stop giving out magician magick to other classes on various pieces of armor--you're hurting our chances for grouping here and violating the theme of this game (such as it is)"<P>vs. <P>"1) Don't get rid of DoTs just fix them (resists., mana costs and special effects?), too many folk do not understand how incredibly useful they are. Especially when engaging mutliple foes with no enchanter or unmezzable foes."<P>I know the first one is referring to armor but when you get down to it I think it amounts to the same thing.  If you give mages DOTs who needs a necromancer for example?  I don't think the original intent of a mage was for them to have DOTs.<P>Why should mages get improved DOT spells?  The DOT line of spells has always been the realm of the shaman, necromancer and druid.  I think by making the DOTs better for mages you are giving the best of both worlds and that's not totally fair. <P>If you DO improve the DOTs the other DOT casting classes will want improved DD's which will of course cause mages and wizard to complain.  So what can you do?<P>But then you can't please everybody can you?  No matter how hard Verant tries. <P>I think this entire tuning thing is just opening a big ugly can of worms and no matter what is done somebody is going to get p*ssed off.<P>Silvus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Couple more things<P>The PoG and Velious quested for mage armor effects.<P>We get DS on robe, sucks if you are 56+, good idea to put the 56 d on robe.<P>Legs have burnout 3... I will NEVER use this effect, if you have burnout 4...theres no point, at all. I think both necromacer and magician legs should be upgraded on the effect.<P>Spells<BR>=======<BR>DoTs-I really dont think we should get these DoT's spells. I would think you guys agree since you made em so sucky. Either remove them or make them better. Ie: Less mana, more damage, less cast time.<P>Stun spells- This is a major request, maybe you can replace our DoT's with them, when the chanter or cleric or whoever forgets to stun the gater or gets resisted we can help out. Doesnt have to do damage, just work =)<P>Mana Regen- Some form of this please, dont understand why you gave it to all casters, wis and int, but clerics and mages.<P>New pet weapons- That proc like they used to, would be great.<P>Upgraded pet heal- I dont think we need this.<P>Pet SoW- we already have it, its called Velocity<P>Shard of the Core- Make these go in ammo slot and make them tradable.<P>Dragons/Gods/Boss mobs- Make us more useful against these guys. Need it be less resistable nukes or pets immune to fear, something.<BR>======================================<P>And i guess since we arent discussing epics here, theres nothing else i can think of atm.<P>Solkain<BR>60th Arch Mage<BR>Elysian of Brell<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I totally agree with the poster who said the mages shouldn't lose 50% of the experience when their pet does most of the damage.  How the hell are we supposed to fight without pets?  And if you think that we should just nuke more to make sure we do more damage, you're crazy.  I didn't start a mage to play the 'out damage Jebeker' game.<P>I fully support the idea of giving us DD spells based on ALL the elements.<P>"Yeah, I control the elements, so do you want me to nuke this thing with fire, or some magic based DD?  Cold Based?  What's this c-o-l-d that you speak of?"<P>After all these excellent posts about things that were missed, I have to add a small idea of my own.<BR>It has to do with roleplay... I know it's likely useless to many of you, but dammit, it'd be fun.  Let us do pet emotes!  This would be easy to implement and fun for some of us.  Just don't put it higher up on the list than more important issues...

</FONT><HR>You have my agreement about DOTs. Why in the name of all the Gods of Norrath do we get these kinds of spells?  I said it when I first heard of it:<P>we aren't Necros, Druids or Shaman.<P>So WHY give us this kind of magick when so much of what we should be doing isn't working right or is simply useless?<P>But yes, if you insist on FORCING us to use this magick, at least make it worth using.

</FONT><HR>/sigh<P>I read all the threads/responses, for the most part the lists reflect the talk thread (with a few omissions, odd interpretations), with the exception of THIS one.<P>You ignored everything in the thread, and just stuck with your original list.  We want more useful summons, yes (1hb anyone? armor? Move the cutsie spells to 44/49, give us real post 50 spells)<P>Replace DoTs with new Cold and Magic based resist spells (we are master of elements, remember?)<P>I don't agree with the above posters about the /pet no attack, etc... In game most people don't want it, thnk i will be too overpowering (sound of the few on the board), just fix the pathing.<P>Master of elements, master of elements, master of elements.<P>Also, the Monster summoning is great (It's fun, and doesn't take away any power) but it would be great if the level of the pet went up with us (IOW, let us use it for a wider range of levels)<P>Also, spell drops... I think everyone, except warriors that make tons of money on them, agrees that we don't like spell drops, period.  Let us buy them...
