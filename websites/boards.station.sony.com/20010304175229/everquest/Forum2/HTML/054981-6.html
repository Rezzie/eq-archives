</FONT><HR>Why the perception of clerics are imbalanced.  I think I've figured this out (I hope)  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I've done my share of ranting and raving, mostly in support, but some objection to the whole druid/cleric/shaman debate.<P>I think I know why clerics are deemed by many to be too powerful, needed on raids, and any number is ok.  We are the only class whos primary role is casting spells on group members that will never get resisted, always tack on for full, always work.  I'm by no means implying a resistable heal, that would destroy EQ for every class.  I'm simply saying when we spend 400 mana on a CH, we know its going to work if the mana is spent.  And since healing is something you can never have too much of, thats why many clerics are desired at once.  Necros for instance, their dots stack only once (when they hit of course).  So, having 5 necros in a group would be a pointless thing.  Shaman kind of go the same way in the respects to DOTs done by one shaman dont need to be casted from another.  They won't stack  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.  Clerics, well, you can heal someone 92138473 times in a row, and it'll hit everytime.<P>Is it clerics fault that so many mobs are so magic resistant that other classes (Druid, Shaman, etc) feel the effects of it, but clerics do not, since we (for the most part) do nothing to the mob itself.  Is it clerics fault that mobs in Velious are pretty much unmezzable?  No, thats not a "get a group free" card for a cleric, thats a stupid decision made by Verant.  Ask any cleric, they love their enchanter first and foremost, or at least they should  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.  We dont want *ANY* class to be hampered, but because Verant has made this decision to make mobs so resistant to magic, etc, clerics get a bad name because - besides melee, we're not affected by it.  That make sense?<P>If anything, Verant needs to drop the MR on some of these mobs.  When you make a mob thats 100% MR, you are *BEGGING* for a uber melee/uber healer combo.  THAT needs to change for the betterment of all classes, imo.<P> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I am just glad that when I play my cleric, I pretty much only team with the friends I have made in the last 2 years.<BR>  My cleric is my primary. Hes boring. He has to rely on other people... for travel, for invis to go rez someone, for corpse locations so i can rez, for corpse "pulling" by necros (once again for rez's) - I've traveled from Vellious to Kunark by boat to rez a friend, because as a cleric - i like helping people. I go out of my way to help people.  But the sad part and fact of the game - this isn't a roleplay game folks... this is a Video Arcade Game that verant is selling to make money.  The guy who puts the most quarters into the game gets to play to the highest levels and have the most fun.  Right now the avarage on my server is 38% druids.  This means that druids put the most quarters in the game...<P>I won't revoice the opinions of my fellow clerics, i read FIFTEEN of these web "pages" saying pretty much the same things.. and all through the whole thing ... all FIFTEEN pages of posts.. probably 1000 posts.... all i could think of was:<P>Isn't this a discussion on how clerics can be made better?<P>All i saw as a response from Alan, was how he was changing other classes... Druids mostly (shaman's really didn't get that much.<P>----------------------------------------------<BR>I don't play a shaman, but I don't mind them getting the heals, even remedy.. after all - shamans are just clerics for the "dumb/evil/uncultured" races... they should be able to heal. But druids are "uber" enough -<P>Lets look at the breakdown from my unoffical polling of the percentage of classes, since people say a cleric shouldn't be required to create a group:  <P>Each group needs at least 1 healer - so of 100% of the population, at least 16.7% - we will round up to 17%, needs to be a healing class.  In my unofficial query of my server at about 2200 people online during primetime weekend, I saw the following breakdown:<P>12% Cleric<BR>7% shaman<BR>38% druid<BR>1% bard (token healing for humor?)<P>So to get a healer, you need 5% more clerics to make up that 17% - which, seeing as boring as clerics are - your probably not going to find (thus the other class's complaint of waiting on a cleric)<P>So, lets give Shamans the lower level and more reliable Sheal, and the Remedy like spell. That gives us another 7%. Add in 12% cleric and it totals 19% of 17% needed.  2% overlap - nothing to worry about.<P>But lets consider giving druids those healing spells instead: 38% + 12% = 50% of 17% needed, a 33% overlap thats not needed... ouch. See why clerics are worried?<P>Now lets look at All three getting Remedy and reliable Sheal -&gt;  12 + 38 + 7 = 57% of 17% needed, a whapping 40% left in the cold... or even ASSUMING 2 in a group... thats a 34% need, with 12% left in the cold... hmmm.. 12% clerics? they are the least multifunctional after all...<P>Okay, I had stated the same thing as 1000 other posts - but i tried to show how it effects the "group dynamics" <P>Give shamans's better heals, and you shouldn't need to find a cleric to team - a shaman would be just as good without hurting clerics chances much.  Shamans and clerics are brother healers from diffrent cultures.<P>Druids are the "Jack of all trades (healing, DD, DOT, Port, SoW, Snare, solo, group)" and shouldn't be "super-uber" at anything - But I am sure Verant is gonna make them such, because as I stated in the beginning, they pay the most quarters to support the game and have the loudest voice because of the sheer numbers of them.<P>I am just glad I have a good guild - one with friends that will always prefer me over some L33t Phat Lewts ninja lootin Kewl Dr00d!  (and thats what's sad, some of the druids are really nice folk but the class as a whole tends to be the get rich quick type personality).<P>Shuttin Up now.<P>Garon Silverfist<BR>42 Circle, Dwarven Priest of Brell<BR>Guktofey Trading Company (guild)<BR>Bertoxx Server<BR>Created April 1, 1999, played 70+ Days.<BR>Yes, I spend as much time helping others as I do leveling  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>AKA Dielgore, 16 Ogre Warrior, Played 2 days  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am sad to see how this whole thing has turned into a whining contest.<P>  I play a cleric, druid, and shaman they are the three highest level characters I have.  My favorite is playing the cleric, with this class I can help others by healing and buffing.  I also go out of my way to res people if I am in zone and it will not interfer with my adventures.<P>  Clerics can melee at lower levels for a short period of time, it is all about how you play your cleric.  While developing my cleric I would agro many blues and let them beat on me, this increased my Defense skill.  At 34th with FS armor I was sitting at 649 AC....that is pretty good when most other clerics at that level were lower than I.  What that means is when something agro's on me I can stand there and take a beating for a bit longer to allow time for the warrior to taunt the thing off, or finish off the creature he is killing before taking this one on.<P> While playing my druid I found that you can't get beat on, it is a diferent playing style....same as the shaman.  They each have a different playing style.<P>  What everyone should understand that each class brings a different bonus to a group.  I found as druid I get less offers for group when inside....makes sense since my spells are mostly outside spells.  But at the same time the druid gets many offers when in outside zones.  Clerics are wanted no matter where they are, especially when you get to higher levels.  Shamans are a good mix of both classes.<P>  I have yet to suffer with any of these 3 classes like everyone says.<P>  To the Druids and shamans who call us clerics whiners.....if you read thru the posts you find it to be a handful of the same people arguing with you about how we clerics got the shaft.  Please don't let the minority of whining clerics represent the majority of us clerics.<P>  To the Clerics who are whining about the Druids and Shamans getting these upgrades.  We will never lose our ability to be master healers.  The res line of spells alone will keep us in groups.  Our buffs are second to none....stats bonus or hp/ac buffs.....I take ac/hp buffs.  We get to slaughter the undead, soloing them is very easy.<P>  All in all, I don't think this will make a big difference in the game.  Clerics are a very rare class played and no matter what changes you make, I doubt they will become more popular than they are now.<P>  My favorite being the Cleric, I love the idea of having Druids and Shaman with better heals.  Means less deaths in groups or raids, since I wont be OOM all the time with a great deal of time medding.  I can let them do some healing and enjoy the raid even more.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/054981-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/054981.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/054981-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/054981-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/054981-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/054981-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=054981&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=054981&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
