</FONT><HR>Why are you starting with an already well balanced class? Granted they proly do need somethings fixed like thier fizzle rate on SH but you're overhauling them when there are other classes like paladins, sks, and rangers that have been begging for overhauls for months.<P>I do not appreciate having my post 50 heal spells given away. You've nerfed everything you've ever given us that gave us any versatility beyond healing/rezzing.  You even nerfed our trakanon bp to an insane cast time.   There is no reason to give druids Remedy nor any of our healing spells.  If you're rehauling classes to keep us playing I sincerely suggest you realise if you give away cleric healing spells that you better do clerics next or  you'll prolly lose alot of us. Then you'll have no one to rezz your precious druids. <P>I'm sick of classes that are more stable than other classes getting buffed up when classes that really need looking over and hav been begging for it are ignored.<P>I love being a cleric but if you give away my healing spells and do nothing to add to my enjoyment. I"ll make a druid on my second account, solo my way to 60, and just rezz myself everytime I die.  Because if you give away my healing spells I have lost even more to my class.  We have very VERY few spells that aren't in part shared with another class. Skin like series overwrite reso.  Healing you're wanting to give away. Soon all I'll have to look forward to is logging in to be chased by people wanting rezzes.  Yes chased. I had to buy a robe so I could walk through a low level zone without being asked for money, buffs, and rezzs.  Even with the robe i still get harassed so much it's insane. <P>Leave our cleric 50+ heal spells alone.  Fix the SH fizzles for druids and leave the rest of our spells alone. Druids do NOT need remedy nor any of our 50+ heal spells. If you do feel you must give our 50+ heal spells away then I damn well better see at the very least a self invisibility spell added to my spellbook.<P><BR>Miktiku MendHeart<BR>Level 51 Enfuriated Cleric<BR>Adamantine Kinship<BR>Mithaniel Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have played my cleric up and like so many other clerics had been turned down for groups before 34 in preference to a druid or shaman because they can buff (See: DS/DoT/Nuke/Regen/SoW/WF/Snare/Slow) and all we can do is HEAL. Our HP buffs are negligable to that of a druid, and in some cases (SLN vs Resolution) not as good when you consider the regen aspects. We do one thing, HEAL. Have I said that? Ok then. This is why we're in demand. If you try to shift that deman onto another class, and especially a class that already has so much to offer in a group, then clerics are useless anymore.<P>At 50th level Superior Heal is our real class-defining heal spell, since it is most often used in comparison to Complete Heal. That spell has been given to Dru/Sha after 50 and I agree that they should have it and it should not fizzle nearly as much as it does. However, this spell should remain at it's current level and NOT reduced to 44 or 49 as this ONCE AGAIN put clerics in the same boat! After 34th level I had very little trouble finding a group, but now here comes Uber-Druid or Uber-Shaman with his new 44th level SH. Great, 10 levels of gameplay, and then quit playing a cleric because everyone can heal just as well as I can. What's the point in having a cleric then? Honestly? What would we be contributing to the group? Nothing but the same heals that you have.<P>No group in thier right mind would choose a cleric over a druid or shaman if thier healing powers were equal (and they WOULD be if SH was lowered in level). Do you see someone saying "Hey get the cleric, he can heal and... cast divine aura on himself if he gets in trouble so he's invulvnerable for 19 seconds and unable to heal during that time!". Nope.<P>Take away our superiority at healing and all you have left is our ability to Resurrect. Does that get us groups? NO. It gets us sought for AFTER a group dies (much like Necro's with thier 'Group Friendly' Summon Corpse spell) but does not get us groups.<P>In any case, I have stated that I agree they need to fix the fizzle rate. Absor opened a whole can of worms when he let his jaw flap about what "he thinks" and now we're seeing what WE think about that. Hopefully he reads this and the many threads posted about this topic and makes the right decision.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oh, and ONE MORE thing...<P>Why is it that Dru/Sha should get Superior Heal at 44 or 49 when the discussion was generated based on 55+ mobs?  That makes NO SENSE.  Check any of the other Cle/Dru/Sha threads posted throughout the boards now and you will see Dru/Sha pointing to 55+ creatures and saying they are not efficient to heal in those cases.<P>I repeat to you, Absor, WHY would you LOWER superior heal in level when what they're talking about only happen post-55 anyways?  If thier spell didn't fizzle so much they would be fine AS IS.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>=Fix the SH fizzles for druids and leave the rest of our spells alone. Druids do NOT need remedy nor any of our 50+ heal spells. <P>Druids need a decent hp heal ( 1000hp+ ) so they can be a usable alternate to a cleric in a grp.  SH isnt enough to heal a war over 50.<P>=If you do feel you must give our 50+ heal spells away then I damn well better see at the very least a self invisibility spell added to my spellbook.=<P>I've never seen a class whine so much.  Pre-50 druids got most heals at the next spell lvl after clerics, yet your all whining about druids being given the ability to be an alternate to a cleric, as they always were in the original game.  If clerics get self invis druids should get self invis to undead.

</FONT><HR>I never knew that EverQuest was designed for the few 50+ people in the game.  I guess i was wrong when i thought that balancing issues were usually supposed to be towards the majority of the player (90%) who are waging battles with 6 or less people.<P>I guess i keep forgetting that all the tuning that needs to be done from 1-45 takes a second seat to planes raids and dragon hunts, because you 's3l3kT 3l337' are the ones who think you are entitled to it because you have more free time.<P>Can we quit being selfish here and focus on the problems that affect more than 10% of the druids?  Can we focus on the pre 50 stuff and quit trying to get rez and CH and unresistable things in our quest to become s00p3rUb3r?<P>Personally, i would think that things like Class Qeust armour, Treant Form and other similiar additions to the 'lower level caste' would be a tad more important since 90% of the players do not have the time or have too many responsibilities to ever get to the post 50 game.  <P>Am i way off base?  No, powergamers, i dont want you to answer, since you are obviously biased.  I am just really sick of the board being monopolized with the post 50 whining because they can't do everything under the sun and the other levels getting shafted because they don't complain as loud.<P>Thanks.<P>--Secias</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>After thinking about the whole situation about who has what healing rights as a cleric/druid/shaman, I have come to this conclusion.<P>The healing game is pretty much the way it should be up till after lvl 29. ie druids/shammys lvl they get greater heal.  <P>This is where it should have drastically changed in a different way.  I really don't think druids/shammys should be instant healers.  They channel forces of nature/spirits to do their bidding.  As well Clerics are not healers over time as druids/shammys are.<P>In effect I think it was a slap in druids/shammys face that clerics recieved the celestial elixir type healing spells and a slap in clerics faces that druids/shammys recieved sheal/possibly remedy/divine light.<P>Around lvl 44 dru/shammy should have recieved a celestial elixir type spell that healed aroudn 600-700 hp over 20 second period.  Then at 55-60 recieved another celestial type heal spell that healed aroudn 1000-1400 hp over 20 seconds.<P>That makes them a suitable back up healer along the lines that they should heal.  Not as a main healer but as one that saves a cleric or caster or keeps a tank alive for a ch.<P>I for one was very mad when I used 600 mana on regrowth of the grove to have it nulled by a cleric with celestial elixir.  I do feel druids/shammys were tread on with those type of spells.<P>I don't want to be prime healer, how ever, I do want to beable to keep others alive as well be used on epic battles other then getting people there and then porting them out.  I am seriously considering changing class to warrior just so I am useful cause being a "taxi" is no fun at all.<P>I'll share something with you real fast.  Most fun epic raid I had in a while was for warrior epic killing Queen in chardok.  Why?  cuase I could actually damage her with my spells, it was very refreshing to have a purpose other then to wait for it to be all over to port everyone out.  Even though after my first cast everytime she instantly agroed on me cause as everyone knows druids have agro like mad.  Sigh and our equip sux.  You'd think that we give up AC we'd get equip with better stats then clerics but eh...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I really like playing my level 35 druid.  I appreciate the versatility of the class.  While I truly enjoy the social dynamics of grouping, there are times when I can only play for a short time.  During those times, my druid can travel quickly to her destination and solo for experience without taking the time to get a group, or I can get pleasure from sitting at the gates of a city making life a little easier on lower level characters.  I hope the changes you are considering do not take away those options from me.  If I had to suggest any changes, it would be the superficial change of upgrading the appearance of the armor.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>EQCLERIC's post is indeed well written and exceptionaly well thought out. However this is the point that is missed. A viable replacement for the cleric in the day to day group IS needed. I'm sorry, if there is NO acceptable replacements as primary healer, not secondary that is already what druids are, in a daily group then you are resitricting the MAJORITY of players, yes majority because of the number of clerics compaired to total server population, to the necessity of ONE class. When the majority, see above, of the players have the option of sitting at a zone and pulling door trash or playing a twink because there simply ISN'T an acceptable replacemnt to a cleric then something is very very wrong. <P>Several posts have mentioned the cleric be religated to only being logged in to do rez's. Ask around in the druid community what they have been religated to post 50. The majority will say they are just logged in to port.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I play a cleric and my wife plays a druid, both plus 50. Druids are by far and away the more fun and versatile of the two classes.  Fixing fizzle rates on sheal and maybe droping it to lvl 52 are the only reasonable changes to the other priest classes in the area of healing. If the other cleric heals are given to those classes and/or sheal is droped to a much lower level, with all the other advantages they already have then you might as well fold up the tent on the cleric class.  Complete heal is a great spell, but I and most clerics cast sheal more often in a wider varity of situations. As for rezzing, that ability has never gotten me in a group. People want it after they are dead but they DO NOT group with you ahead of time to get it, except in the planes.  Most of the other cleric spells are of limited practical use. I will gladly trade ITU for greater camo, atone for levitate, and divine aura for SoW. I realize that the idea of destroying the cleric class is of no threat to the game because you can always give our spells to other classes if the lack of clerics was truely precived as a problem. It would however be a great disservice to long time players of clerics like myself who don't have a stable of other high level characters to switch to because our playing time is limited.  Every class has a role to play beyond the lower levels. For clerics that is healing and that is all.  Druids are gaters/evacer's, SoWer's, nukers, and BACK UP healers. Give them the ablity to even come close to a clerics healing power particularly between levels 34 to 50 and the cleric class and all those who have dedicated themselves and hundreds of playing hours to it are gone.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

You find another warrior or 2 sub warriors (pal/sk)<BR>What if the chanter left?  You find another chanter or 2 sub chanters (bard/nec)<BR>What if your evacer or group gater left(no one logs deep in a dungeon)?  You find another wiz or druid.<BR>What if your cleric left?  You find another cleric or 2 sub clerics (druid/sha/pal)<P>This formula holds true in 98%+ encounters.  Its the few uber areas where it doesnt.  Why not? Its the encounters themselves.  VI made 'hard' encounters = high mr/hp/damage.  This made the warrior/cleric ideal in these situations.  Where are the melee resistant mobs (90-100% parry)?  Where are the mobs that can only be harmed by certain types of damage (cold,fire,magic,poison,disease)?  Where are the mobs that hit for 50X8 a round instead of 200X2 a round so your damage shields become needed? Its VI's poor vision of a 'hard' encounter that has caused this imbalance problem.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The day druids and shamans can fill in for the cleric isn't the day people stop inviting clerics to their groups. It's the day people keep playing when the cleric already has a group or goes to bed. Without ressurection, a druid or shaman isn't *ever* going to picked when a cleric is available, and pickup groups will *still* fall apart when the cleric leaves because now the risks spiral totally out of control.<P>If it's the day some clerics quit too because their EQ careers aren't fulfilling enough anymore, two kinds of clerics will quit:<P>1) the kind that started or keep playing clerics for their utter domination of their role, not because they love taking care of people. Don't let the door hit you on the way out.<P>2) the kind that love being a healer, but just aren't having fun with the realities of 50+ cleric life. (beside the fact that the realities of 50+ life are usually less fun for everybody). For you guys, the real problem isn't whether druids and shamans should heal well, it's "how can Verant make your class fun enough to stand on it's own merits without the crutch of being the only good healer in the 50+ game?"<P>Let's face it. Being the only healers in the high level game is a crutch, because clerics are obviously not satisfied by being the best healers, and they're obviously not satisfied by being the most wanted healers thanks to ressurection.<P>We have to find a way to make the cleric class a fun and rewarding class itself without that crutch for the sake of clerics, class balance, and so the game can be more about just playing with friends and having fun again without being so stuck on one cookie cutter group after another for the sake of safety.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am a 53 Druid.  I was finally able to get in on my first raid.  My heals there?  Pretty much forget it.  The action is way to swift and by the time I got one off, the caster was dead already.  I knew going in that I would be backup healer only.  Sow not allowed.  DoTs not allowed.  My buffs were not needed.  Death?  Yup...over and over!  But I did have a blast seeing a new place!  I was able to save a couple players due to the mobs enjoying taking the time to kill me early on and the cleric able to get off that needed heal.  Of course, most clerics had to make themselves invulnerable and camp to be able to rez the rest.  Now...one thing that super slowed the raid down that a Druid or Wiz could be very valuable at has not even been addressed.  <P>Why not give the Druid and Wizard the ability to group TP to "their" bind spot?  This would allow both of these classes to have something in line with their current exclusive rights that would in no way unbalance the game and make us a more wanted class in groups or raids.  How many times has the group died and you have spent over an hour getting all back together to "re-break" the area so the cleric can relog and rez folks?  If the Druid and Wiz could Group TP to bind spot...they could TP and pick up all those tanks and get the rebreak back underway and the fun going again.  Raids take an unbelievable amount of organization and setup.  Most are planned for weeks.  Most of the time spent on a raid is spent sitting and twiddling your fingers.  The one Fear raid I went to, we spent at least 90% of the 14 hours doing nothing.  <P>Armor...yup...is sad to look like a newbie and completely recognizable as a druid even after getting our nice titles after 50.  The constant request for TPs do not stop even if you go anon because one look and everyone around you knows for a fact that you are a druid...not a doubt!  They haven't much of a clue of your level unless they ask.  I have been mistaken for a newbie so many times that the pride in the hard work on my level is only visable to me.  My sister is a cleric (Lev 60) and has such a wide wardrobe.  Folks are constantly asking her, "Where did you get that?".  Her hard work shows and she beams with pride as she launches into the exploits that garnished that special item.  I now have the nice Nature's Garb.  Looks exactly like the leather I wore as a lev 1.  Even the icon is all tattered and ugly.<P>As for healing...with less fizzles I would be happy.  I don't want to be a cleric.  I don't want the primary healing role, even though I end up as that most of the time.  I want to have some skill though that could be of a great help to groups after 50.  Making helping out in the Teleporting area would do that.  Instead of just being a taxi, we would have that skill to assist the group thru normal play.  Wouldn't it be nice if your Druid or Wizard was able to bind, TP to a ring elsewhere, pick up the tank and group back to the group instead of an extra 20-40 mins of travel time to get them there?<P>Thanks for listening.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

(do tanks even come on to these boards or is it only casters and druids) Druids are built to be the "average" character...can't anhialate with spells and don't have permanent pets that do dmg equal to tanks...on the flipside, damage shield is the only thing enabling us to tank....as for quad-kiting, i'll belive that when i see it, AoE spells dmg:mana is a no go...baiscally you're oom while they have half life unless you're a 200wis twink.<P>I agree - stop hogging the boards 50+...maybe legit concerns but enuf about superior healing...i think we need a sperate board for post50 considering they have specific concerns that lower levels wouldn't see with their mobs and/or groupings.<P>***Idea 9 - Effect equip<BR>In a previous post they mentioned there are ways to get druid effects with equip, perhaps it's our turn...maybe the mana regen i mention be an equip effect druid only.<P>***Idea 10 - more quests<BR>how's about some mid level spells gotten through quests, maybe components through a quest in order to use the spell.<P>***Idea 11 - shield HP/AC line won't overwrite cleric HP/AC line<P>***Idea 12 - new discipline (you're gonna love this)we are the masters of traveling, make us do it then<P>*Mana Focus Discipline - increased through quests only, (use less mana for spells), you can mess with it a little, make it alteration only, choose a school, or whatever...Group Focus?? :&gt; )<P>*Spell Focus Discipline - increased through quests only, (make spell cast faster or make more powerful, I'll let you choose seeing as how it's your game), mess with it same as above...faster as discipline increase = spell faster by .1<P>their HP/AC buffs are double or triple in amount of increase and length of spell<P><BR>as for the healing part of it, maybe there is some ratio that was used to figure when and what a druid would get, at 35 i'm content with the heal, if it stays with that ratio then no one can say too much about it....if there isn't a ratio make one and stick with it, right now i believe i can heal a tank non-cleric-buff 1 and 1/2 bubs of hp, somehwere around there anyway...most likely these high level people are buffed so much that the ratio might be reduced by half...oh well, that's the point of the buff, not the heal. <BR>___________________________________________<BR>Also make spells by quest no drop, ya go to fironia vie and it's nothing but a black market.<P>It seems the only way to help balance things is to add more stuff...i've mentioned somethings that try to even it out - penalty exp, quest for items (if you make mana regen an effect from equip, don't make it oudoors only), components...We are mediocre and i expect to stay that way, though i wouldn't mind a power increase :&gt; )<P>Good Luck appeasing the people that expect nothing less than an easy fight for lots of exp.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I would just like to state first that I believe we were nerfed far more than any other class in the first 6 months, maybe even year of this game opening. It's time to rectify that. To this end, here's the issues I would like to see addressed(and I'm sure a lot of them already have been by other people in this and previous threads. So without further ado...<P>Superior Healing - Something absolutely HAS to be done about the fizzle rate of this spell. Imagine being on a raid deep in a dungeon somewhere and there aren't enough clerics to go around. You as a druid have been put in charge of healing for a particular group but oops! Guess what? When people start to lose health and you go to cast your best healing you get....fizzle. Fizzle. Fizzle. Fizzle. Do you know how frustrating it is to be on top of things and ready to heal and that's what you get? And if the tank(or whoever) ends up getting killed because of it then that's a problem. A big problem. Lowering the level I don't think will solve it. It will help the people that don't even have it up until 54 because then they have a viable healing spell but only if it WORKS. If I can't cast the damn thing 6 levels after I get it, 5 more won't help. You need to tweak whatever code you have to to get it to fizzle less. PERIOD. This would also help with grouping aspects whereas druids get heavily overlooked for groups in dungeons as far as healing goes. More about the grouping and dungeon aspect later though.<P>Charm Animals and Plants - Good concept but VERY poorly implemented. What about us high level druids? There's nothing for us to charm. I know, Absor states "we don't want to redo zones or put in new stuff" or something to that effect(god forbid they do anything new or creative). I don't know if that's a programming issue or not but how about for your next expansion actually putting animals and plants in WORTHY of charming? And while I'm on the subject, how about more outdoor zones with named NPC's and better loot? Most of the good items come from dungeons, a place where druids are woefully inadequate.<P>I'm pretty happy with spells in general. I think that's part of the reason druids get a bum rap. I still would like to see less resists overall though. A fire based mob that resists a cold based spell(or visa versa)? That's just stupid. But as far as druids it's like "you have all those great spells; you can teleport, sow, heal, buff, have good DD's and good dots, etc., so why do you need anything else"? We do, which brings me to my next topic and possibly the sorest spot with me...<P>Equipment - Pathetic. That isn't even a strong enough word. The leather look until 50, thanks for that piece of work. Who thought of that? And where's all the druid specific gear? We get very little stuff in general we can use but there's hardly ANYTHING that's druid only. I'm tired of wearing other classes' hand me downs! There are WAY too many wisdom items in this game that can only be worn by clerics and shamans. FIX THAT.<P>As far as quad kiting, never done it don't care. I certainly don't see it as a balance issue and if it was then I would say it should be nerfed actually. GASP! I can't beleive I just said to nerf a druid feature! But when a warrior of your same level can't even solo one blue con mob and you're doing 4 of them? That's pretty screwed up. I'm talking about high levels here mostly. Lower level warriors can actually solo one thing at a time, but that's about it...hehe.<P>Getting back to the dungeon aspect. Druids are shunned like the plague in dungeons. Hey, if you're going to make necros more group friendly(the most powerful solo class in the game bar none) then you better lend us some help too.<P>And as far as the "infringement" spell issue you mentioned in one of the other threads Absor...all the classes don't infringe on all the others? PLEASE! If you want to make an argument for not letting druids get a better heal after Sup Heal you better come up with something better than that. There's got to be a way to make druids more viable in dungeons. It HAS to be done. I'll break it down for you: If you're a cleric or enchanter you get a group a nanosecond after you zone into a dungeon, any other class forget it. You call that balanced? <P>Don't tell me about the outdoor zones either because I already touched on that. There's NOTHING OUT THERE. Experience yes, but the loot in the outdoor zones sucks compared to the items you can get in dungeons. Then you would probably bring up risk vs. reward, that there's more risk in dungeons. That would be true if the whole risk vs. reward factor even worked in this game. It's all risk while very little reward. Or a reward that you only get after camping for a week straight, thus ensuring us playing more and PAYING more. That's pathetic and not in the spirit of an RPG. But that's getting into a whole LOT of other issues I have with this game.<P>Other people have pointed out things that I'm sure I missed, but the things I stated were my "major" issues. I'm really not that hard of a person to please, I just want to play a class that's logical and viable, that's all. And most of all FUN.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, I'll wade in on this one - I love my little druid, matter of fact - love druids so much I've had two.<P>That said - I am not your typical player, nor are some things that are important to some important at all to me - if I NEVER see a dragon - it will be too soon.<P>Druids as a package seem absolutely the most well balanced class right now of any - and I've at least dabbled in most classes. I would advise extreme caution messing about with druid balance, if it ain't broke - don't fix it.<P>The only two gripes (and someone mentioned these above) I've ever had were not enough port points - and this affects EVERYONE, not just druids. Many unused rings around the world, we just need to get'em turned on. True exploring for the newbie is part of the adventure, but once past that point - it's just time consuming tedium.<P>The other is that the better my equipment gets as a halfling the more I look like a Lvl 1. The cultural armor looks like plain leather - I think it was well thoughtout and makes very nice filler pieces for those tween stages - but looks are important, and I think it make it a more sought after armor for more than just the marginal stats.<P>The port location issue is world impacting. I've always had the opinion we should never have to run more than one zone max to get ANYWHERE. At the very least - setup a keyring of some sort and make folks get to the ring once like Velious - then let us avoid the tedium of it being a daily 30 min jog. <P>Now, as I said above - my priorties are different than most folks that play druids. I lothe kiting (although the ability is nice to have in a pinch), I much prefer grouping and using my abilities in a support fashion. And druids CAN be nice support characters. Heck - I'm one of the few druids I know that master specialized in Alteration instead of Evocation. There are quite conceivably other issues at the 50+ level - but I will personally never see them, nor do I much care to. Folks that are knowledgeable about those levels will undoubtedly inform you of their take on the matter, but I will chime in to say - keep it there. A post 50 problem is probably not relevant to a pre 50 condition - and I'd really be leary about changing too much for something that actually works very well.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The mana efficiency of the healing is only one part of the equation.  You also must consider the healing over time.<P>Clerics (with CHEAL) heal 10K of damage in 12.5 seconds (counting recharge time)<P>Druids with SHEAL (at 53) (assuming  a 20% fizzle rate) heal 10k of damage in 151 seconds<P>If you assume you've somewhat less than 10k to heal, say 4k,  the cleric STILL takes 12.5 seconds. the Druid takes 60 seconds.<P>The cleric is capable of healing 800 damage per second.  On a 4K target, it's only 320 damage per second.<P>The Druid is capable of healing about 66 damage per second.  If you thow in the Regen the druid can add, you add 2 or 3 damage per second healing.<P><BR>If your mob is doing significantly more than 66 DPS, or you have more than one of them, then the druid can't keep up.<P>(I assume the numbers for Shamans are similar.)<P>However, (IMO) if you give groups the opportunity to replace the cleric with a druid (or shaman) on a one-for-one basis, they WILL, for all the OTHER things the druid (or shaman) bring to the group.  The cleric, IMO, should EASILY outheal any single other healer, or they will have no place.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Oh Boy, I was really hoping this day wouldn't come.  Sometimes I wish that everyone could just get a long ya know =).<P>I know this is alot of rehashed stuff, and many other druids have posted concerns/issues with the druid class post 50.  However, the more that the class says about itself even if rehashed, the more Absor and Brad will take a look at it.  <P>1.) Healing Abilities.  All I can say is that I'm not that very happy with Sup Heal.  The fizzle rate is skyhigh, and beyond unreliable.  My specialize alteration is 200, normal alt 235 and I still get way over the 20% fizzle rate that most are saying.  One time I actually fizzled it 8 times in a row, luckly this was outdoors and not in a crusial situation.  It really needs to be looked into.  Not to mention the fact that when it is working it cannot keep up with the mobs hitting for 400-600 dmg in 4 seconds with a cast time of 6 and 20% fizzle adding on an extra second or more.  I've made it a point to pound on my hotkey until it goes off or the situation steadys.  There is a couple of solutions that people have proposed that would benifit not only the dru/sha community, but ALL players.  With the current setup, I call myself a Ghetto healer.<P>Solution:<BR>Move Sup heal to dru/sham to 49, and lower the fizzle rate at least to acceptable levels.  Now this leaves a big void for the dru/sham class in the post 50's, what would we use to heal?  I suggest a *NEW* spell for BOTH the dru/sham that does a heal in the approx range of 1k, weither it be 900-1300 heal is obsolete.  The clerics still have better heals, rez, and better stackable buffs.  You arn't gonna see druids and shammys replacing the power of clerics anytime soon and they shouldn't, and infact if you are a good cleric you see that your job might just infact become a little easier if both of these classes have a little boost to their healing power.  I suggest level 55 for this type of spell, as sup heal will carry us backup healers through 49-55.  What else would help would be a slightly lower casting time than Sup heal on this spell, some where in the range of 4.9 seconds with 325 mana use.  Keep in mind to keep this fizzle rate LOWER than the current state Sup heal has.  A spell that fizzles 2-3 times each cast goes to the back of my spell book.  Cleric's get CH which does 4k+ on high level tanks, a 1k heal is not even 1/4th of that and not very efficient when it comes to the power of a cleric, however 1/5th of someones life DOES help, 1/16th of someones life by the time you cast doesnt, else we wouldn't have the term of secondary healer =).  And please guys, don't rehash old spells or make it mob only drops, once you hit 55 you should be proud to get that spell, 2 major hell levels, and 2 minor ones inbetween, you should get somewhat of a reward at that point for sticking it out and it should be something a tad unique to both of our classes that doesn't require camping freeport or your local marketplace.<P>Conclusion:<BR>Would this make clerics obsolete in group?  Uhh, no.  Lets face it, there are 3 required classes for any high level dungeon grinding and that is Warrior, Enc, and Cleric.  Even with these changes you arn't going to see required dungeon grinding as Warrior, Enc, Dru/sham.  Most groups I've seen form don't even bother getting an evac'er and they do just fine.  High level raids, you don't evac so what really is the point of grabbing a druid into that?  We do need a little boost with healing and most high level players agree.<P>2.) Fizzle rate on Breath of Ro.  Worse in some cases than the current state of Sup heal.  I rarely use this spell cause it's a waste of mana, highly resisted even if fire resistance is debuffed and only use it if I absolutely have to (which is nearly never).  This needs to be looked into as one of the higest fizzle rate spells around.<P>3.) Scoriae Direct Damage needs a quick look.  Before I get torn a new one from players that will scream unballanced DD's if this is uped from 688 to 712, but lets get some facts out about it.  Starfire a level 49 spell is 612 damage, just fine for the level that you get it, 6 second cast time is just fine for level 49, it has a moderate resist rate and prolly one of the best druid spells around until wildfire.  5 Levels later you get Scoriae, not 100 dmg more, but only 70ish dmg more with a higher resist rate for 2 seconds less cast time, but overly not that an impressive of an upgrade to starfire.  I usually stick to starfire because in the long run with resists vs Scoriae, I can do more dmg with starfire than Scoriae.  A lil boost in dmg output/lower resist would help out the druid community.  In groups it's winged death and es arms all the way.<P>4.) Lack of interrupt spells until fury of sky (INDOORS).  One thing I felt before fury of sky was complete helplessness when it came to a mob casting the gate spell in a good dungeon.  All I could do was sit and med and not really help out the fellow enc/cleric or wizzie to stun the mobs and just keep my fingers crossed.  We have our windline, which does have a high resist rate but CAN interrupt casters.  There is one disadvantage to this and that is the fact that our windline is outdoors only.  The spells are there, but we can't use them.  The only time I really dust these spells off are in karnors or dueling, other than that they really don't have many more uses other than the pretty blue effects.  If a caster trys to gate and fury of air aint up, my mouse hovers over evac while i feel useless.<P>5.) Verminclated Armor and ES armor included.  Heavy weight, crappy AC and not really that great of stats except a few selected ones.  Your hard earned planier armor that you wear with pride should not require you to cast an STR spell on yourself just so you can walk around.  The only reason that druids wear verm is for the look, most keep it in the bank.  I currently have 205 wisdom, 69/78 weight and +175 mana and 752 AC on my character without wearing verm, can't see why i'd want to give that up for a few extra points of ac or other than a fasion statement so i can look like a ranger.<P>6.) Kunark teleports, namely Emerald Jungle and Skyfire.  I understand that you don't want to make the game to accessable to all parts of the world, and want people to explore the world to get to that point instead of just gating there.  However, it's now almost a year later, and I cannot count how many times I've gated to dreadlands (using the circle spell), levitating, running to karnors, and evac to EJ or Skyfire.  It's a tad repetative and kinda foolish after you've made that run a hundred times, it's not that challenging and not very exciting.  Theres no exploring involved and is more of a time sink than anything.  There should be 4 spells added for wizard and druid regarding Kunark teleports.  Circle and Portal of the North (skyfire teleport anywhere), Circle and Portal of the South (ej tele anywhere), and Ring of Dreadlands (gate for wiz).  I cannot forsee any reason why this wouldn't be done.   A gate or circle to some old world places would be nice as well, one near Qeynos, one in gfay (heck, theres a newbie druid ring right next to it so it's not like a complete overhaul of the zone) and a connecting teleport to Rathe Mountains (also there is a druid ring there populated by MANY npc druids).<P>7.) This isn't class balance and my last point, but it's our look.  I look nearly the same as i did when i was level 1 and in full leather and I am now 55.  This is one thing that pertains to druids isn't class ballance, but honestly PLEASE consider it.  Wood elf/halfling/half elf druids NEED robes!  I'd take a robe over verm anyday.  Have you seen photoshop rendered woodelves in robes?  They look AWESOME, they have absolutely NO newbie look to them, and all i can say is WOW.  At least consider the possibility, make them unique and fitting to our class (earthtones maybe?), you'd make alot of druids happy.<P>Gilanthas Stargazer<BR>55 Preserver<BR>Mith-Marr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I do think Verant miscalculated when Complete Heal was needed. My experience is that Clerics don't use CH much at 39th. I think that some true upgrade to Superior Heal (call it Grand Heal and let it cost 400 mana and cure 1000 HP) should actually be a 39th level spell and Complete Heal a 44th level spell.<BR>I also think that Verant was not considering the 51st to 60th level game when they stated out Shamans and Druids Heals. I think Shamans and Druids should get Superior Heal at 44th and Grand Heal at 59th (15 levels of separation between their last spell and the upgrade for each seems reasonsonable when the Cleric has 5 levels of separation). Druids and Shamans should never get Complete Heal IMO since I think that is a Cleric class defining spell. Pallies should get Superior Heal at 54th (15 levels after they got GHeal) and would not get Grand Heal.<P>Oh, and reduce the fizzel rate. If you have a spell, you should be able to use it with a decent level of dependability.<P>But I do think a little more versatility added to Clerics would be a good thing playability wise. Not a self-only SoW or any of that nonsense, but something that would make their lives a bit easier, especially for the casual player. How about the ability to cast a "Word of Recall" which ports the Cleric (and only the Cleric) back to the temple of his gawd  (or perhaps to even to a temple of a gawd the Cleric's gawd is aligned with)? And if anyone should be able to open a Gate to the Plane of Hate, it should be a Cleric of Innoruk. How about a Yaulp castable on others? I am sure people can think of other good Cleric only abilities that would be new.<P>Anyway, I think that if Druids and Shamans are going to be able to handle Healing more, Clerics should be able to do more than Heal.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>For Gil:<BR>"Solution:<BR>Move Sup heal to dru/sham to 49, and lower the fizzle rate at least to acceptable levels. Now this leaves a big void for the dru/sham class in the post 50's, what would we use to heal? I suggest a *NEW* spell for BOTH the dru/sham that does a heal in the approx range of 1k, weither it be 900-1300 heal is obsolete. The clerics still have better heals, rez, and better stackable buffs. You arn't gonna see druids and shammys replacing the power of clerics anytime soon and they shouldn't, and infact if you are a good cleric you see that your job might just infact become a little easier if both of these classes have a little boost to their healing power. I suggest level 55 for this type of spell, as sup heal will carry us backup healers through 49-55. What else would help would be a slightly lower casting time than Sup heal on this spell, some where in the range of 4.9 seconds with 325 mana use. "<P>That spell is better than anything a cleric has. Complete heal (restore health) is a situational spell and to have your cleric on hold for 10 seconds can get your whole party killed. Our best true combat heal is divine light, lvl 53, 880 damage, 350 mana.  You want a better heal?  I sure know what I will ask for in the cleric thread:<BR>Winged Angle of Death<BR>1500 damage (the heal you wanted is better than ours..), 350 mana, get it at lvl 55.<P>Sound fair?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well here is a total desriptive about what I think personally would do to balace the druid class even though we do not need much.<P>OK OK OK I am going to mention quad kiting in this post.  Dont come to conclusions and think OH GOD PLEASE DONT BRING THIS UP.<P>Apparently alot of people think it is unbalanced.<BR>IN A FEW ways it is I can personally point out a few ways it is.<P>Long since public release of EQ people have hunted the dwarves in butcherblock mountians. <BR>I have personally done this because of the insanely fast xp it can wield. Dont get me wrong im not a powerleveler but i wanted to be 49 before velious so i did a few levels in a few days. Personally i think the xp that dwarves in bb mountains wield is unfair to many players. All of the docks and many others are 5 min pops and someone with a manastone which i had can easily take as many as 10 pops in less than 5 min.I think that the dwarves should drop no loot and be much much more difficult making it one less place to powerlevel yourself.<P>Second example is freeport guards in westcommons <BR>no explanation needed<P>NOW TO THE POINT WHICH THIS POST SHOULD CONCERN now that i have got off my soap-box sorry for the rambling<P>I myself could live with a quad kiting nerf lowering the range of AOE spells IF you could make druids WANTED in groups.<P>IDEAS<P>Of course the all famous go around making sup healing 49 and fizzle less<P>Give druids a sort of Memory blur spell single target similar in likeness to the necromancer screaming terror spell. Make a level 34 version outdoor only and make a 49 version indoors.<P>OR......<P>lower the levels on the egress.... succor spells to make them viable at those 49 and post 50 levels<P>dd..... druids are good on that no fixing needed<P>Buffs..... as far as velious came out i dont see any upgrades needed except a new group wolform.<BR>and maybe some new self forms and group forms.<BR>Make the 49+ plus COATS have some sort of extremly small mana regen maybe 2-3 points. That would make those equivalent to pure casting self buffs.Make a group form of thorncoat or one of the lower ones or just give druids a Decent AC buff and maybe make it give some resistances. just throwing ideas here<P>Teleports.... we need teleports to our homelands as suggested by another player and one port to Everfrost to make that area viable for hunting. This would spread out more players = less crowded areas<P>PUMP UP PERMAFROST<BR>the only use for this dungeon now is twinking and farming itmes and it is the dead truth... i dont know who wouldnt agree with me.<P>that is off topic but i had to mention it<P>mmmmm charm ... good issue to bring up<BR>i read a idea where if the animal conned amiable warmly it could decide to join your or not. 50% chance no aggro worries. I like this idea ....<P>Roots.... we are best rooters hands down no needed changes here<P>Snare.... OK one thing that has perterbed me since the game has came out. NO AOE snare at viable levels. When a druid gets his new found snare the only use is GASP quad kiting....Make this spell a level 34 one 3 min duration and the 56 snare a 10 min like ensnare.. THIS SPELL is one of the foundations and roots of the druid spells and we should be very good at it but yet a wizard can outdo us......maybe even some new kind of snare spell similar to the one found on the epic weapon and then give druids a more group friendly effect on epic.Im all for taking away the snare 1600 dot effect on epic making it into a spell and giving the weapon a group friendly effect since were supposedly incouraging group play.<P>Debuffs.... only since velious have we had one debuff on immolate ... I think personally druids should get some cold,fire,magic resistance debuffer since we are apparently masters of nature. A very weak slow spells would be nice not equivalent to shamans and not even close but in a situation that there wasnt a shaman we could do maybe a 25% debuff. All the small things help .<P>SUPER group friendly spells. currently since velious we have a good number of those especially the 60th level pog that is very nice but we could probably use a group ac buff at higher levels not as good as clerics but weaker<P>Differnt types of DD. we have ice we have fire we DONT have a viable post  50 lightning spell. Druids being masters of nature should be able to cast a spell of all elements including poison and disease you know like a spell that would call on the earths plants to attack with poison or something<P>we could use a good stun spell <P>some sort of haste buff . OK enchantesr get the best haste buff hands down. shamans get a weak version maybe druids could get a similar one to that of shamans.<P>SOW2.... alot of classes get spells of caliber a.k.a breeze,clarity,clarity2. I mean clarity 2 has insane regen of mana for anyone that it can be casted on. WHY not insane speed. make the level cap for casting of sow 2 be level 45+. IT wouldnt be unbalanced. heck you could even make it a quest but since we are talkin of getting rid of quad kiting what would it hurt......<P>damage shield..... no needed changes<P>Class abilities.... I like the idea of a once a day call upon a mighty animal spirit to protect you for one battle very veyr creative idea if i could remember the poster i would give him props.<P>Treant form..... should have mentioned this earlier but i love the idea.<P>A nicer looking wolf form. i myself get tired of seeing the same spirit wolf from 24 to 50+ please make the higher level wolfs look like werewolves or maybe something different like a brown or black wolf ....... i mean something different i realy dont care lol.<P>Quests OH MY GOD. my resent for starting a druid would be besides my base 90 wis&gt; snickers, QUESTS. i remember when sol temple came out and druids did everyone elses quests and ppl were so mad well the REASON we have no quest and rathe mtns are not VIABLE ever never never.<P>speaking of sol temple and twinking i think all items from crafted on up should be made NO DROP ... those items should have been slightly unique but they are not.<P>slightly improved tracking skills for post 50 druids<P>speaking of sow 2 again make it a 50+ spell doh hehe<P>I KNOW THIS MIGHT BE TROUBLESOME BUT MY LAST THOUGHT ON THE LIST would be GIVE all race models the ability to have robe graphics please i am on a 56 k modem and would love to havea  5 hour download or whatever it takes so my druid can wear a robe PLEASE PLEASE im begging.Woodies,haflings and half elves should be able to be robed. That would deffinately solve the same leather look for druids hehe.<P>This is my thoughts<BR>dont have to implement any or all and it may seem alot but adding a majority of these and taking away quad kiting would make me happy personally<P>Eladamre defoliater <BR>51 druid eci<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As a player of almost all classes, yes even at 50+ levels for many classes.  I don't honestly have a problem with Druids gaining remedy at about 56th with SupHeal going to 51st.  I still think it should require 51st level as druids seemed fine pre Kunark or were they underbalanced at that point as well?<P>The point is not to turn a Shamen or a Druid into a primary healer.  A Majority of situations will require a cleric.  Even when playing a cleric at 59th you can go oom rather quick just using Remedy (I know from experience).  Giving Druids and Shamen Remedy will by no means take anything away from the Cleric.  What it will do is allow single groups to do things when a cleric is not available.  If your only taking a cleric with you for Res or Reviviviscence as a precaution, what do you do when you happen to die when not in a group?<P>IMHO, I would still be looking for clerics when going places that are excedingly dangerous or into deep areas where its hard to gain assistance.  However, there are lots of semi-safe areas for single groups 51+ to go and get EXP that generally don't require a cleric if you can get one or two back up healers.  If i'm looking for a healer I would still always pick a cleric, but adding Reviviscence to the Dru/Shm abilities would be very nice for back up healing.  Not to mention on many raids there just aren't enough clerics to go around, and the casters would prefer if you all had a quick casting healing spell to save our lives.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I do think that Divine Light is going a bit too far.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just a couple of enhancements to druids and some comments.<P>Druids are very fun to play.  They can go anywhere quickly.  The class is such a jack-of-all-trades that druids can fit in almost anywhere except on uber-raids.  Uber-raids include planes runs and some very difficult dungeons.  These areas require warrior-type-tanks, enchanters, clerics, and wizards.  I believe that EQ is designed this way so I accept the limitations to druids without complaint  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">.<P>I would love to see improvements to damage shield for druids maybe group damage shield or a damage shield that improves attack too.  A damage shield that gives damage when the MOB is hit would be cool.  Any group with a monk would gladly pick up a druid for a group-mate if the damage shield did damage with attack instead of being passive.  (If you decide to make damage shield a class differentiator at the high levels then druid damage shield can be better than mage spells in this area.  Mages have so much more to contribute to a group like better blast and a pet.)<P>My druid have only used share wolf form in a couple of places.  Druids have to be very careful so that their party doesn't get killed because of wolf form.  It is pretty bad to TP your friends to dreadlands and then share wolf form on them and watch the dragon kill them.  <P>Maybe druids could have treant form that is a better attack/AC then wolf form.  The players with treant form or share treant form might move slower but the added attack/AC would be worth it.<P>Druid armor is a must.  I can't believe that every other class has some cool armor but druids do not.  I suppose I understand why.  Druids are not a tank class and they do not require "special" armor.  Lets get rid of that idea.  Druids heal just like shamans do and druids take damage in multiple MOBs pulls because of those heals.  We should be armor with AC/STR/WIS/DEX/AGI.  My druid at L50 has been wearing a BCP since level 30 when I could finally buy one. <P>Don't take healing from the clerics.  Fixes to the druid and shaman healing may be necessary to make the classes fit into groups but clerics should be required on uber-raids.  It fits the dragonlance model.  You need a tank, healer, and blaster to make it happen.<P>-LePlume</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Someone said, "What if your cleric left? You find another cleric or 2 sub clerics (druid/sha/pal)"<P>That's just it.  If you plan on doing anything other than zone trash in Sebilis and Karnor's, your statement is false.  Two druids/shaman will not be able to keep up with the healing required for the mobs any deeper than that in these two dungeons.  In the 50+ game, there are no "sub clerics".  There are clerics and enchanters and people who do damage.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Actually... if you REALLY want to know what is gross it is the Complete Heal spell.  That spell is honestly far too overpowered and it is the reason for the Cleric Monopoly (tm).  Clerics should hush up about people wanting to actually be able to group without requiring a cleric lest Verant start poking their noses around in their spell books and take a good look at CH.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1) What about giving druid a new magic based DD (without any stun effect) that would work in Indoors too at higher lvl. For example, a dd at lvl 54 who would do like 500 pts of dmg. The only pure magic DD (without stun effect) who works in indoors is Careless Lightning (lvl 19), i think an upgrade of this spell will be very nice.  <P>2) Give us some more "fun" spells or skills. <BR>In fact, i think all class should get some "fun" spells/skills, make them useless. I believe that we would all appreciate them. <P>As many people said, i think if you change the fizzles rate on sup heal and add remedy for druids, that would really help us a ton. I am looking forward to see those propositions going live.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>UberMonk says, "...alls that awaits the cleric are countless tells begging for resses,that used to be tells inviteing them into a group."<P>Sounds like they have a monopoly to me.  The group can't function without a cleric because there ARE NO backup healers at 50+.  You have clerics, enchanters, and everyone else.  Too many times have I seen (and been in) groups of 5 people without a cleric that sat at the Sebilis entrance for 2+ hours doing NOTHING while trying to find a cleric to join us only to have the group either break up because we all found other groups to join (with clerics in them) or we break up and all log out.  It is not right for one class to have such a hold on the game as to make so many people not be able to play at all if they aren't present.  Let me state again:  There are NO backup healers in the 50+ game.  You could have a group of three druid/shaman follow your group of 6 people around (which doesn't have a cleric) for healing and you would ALL die in Sebilis in just the upper floor camps.  The lower floor camps are just impossible without a cleric.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050225-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050225.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050225-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050225-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050225-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/050225-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=050225&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=050225&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
