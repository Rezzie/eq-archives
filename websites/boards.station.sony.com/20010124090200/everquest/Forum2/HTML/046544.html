</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>If you remember, a couple months ago Verant put in a patch to make kiting less effective. That is, DoT will do 2/3 dmg if the DoTed mob moves around.<P>But now with this new root/snare "fix", they are actually reversing that patch back then. For necros and druids (and other snare+root owners), kiting have never been easier.<P>Just snare/darkness a mob, then root it, and med far away safely. If root breaks, just re-root it, since the mob is snared, you'll have plenty of time to re-root.<P>And don't forget the bonus, rooted mobs will take FULL DoT damage cuz they're not moving.<P>I really wonder if Verant really know what they're doing with their 'fixes'.. they're patching one hole and makes another hole leaks.<P>- Solos Chimamire<BR>- Mithaniel Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>You are still having to root the mob 3-5 times per fight, using between 40 mana (lowest root) and 120 mana per root attempt. That's the cost of a couple of DOTs mana-wise, so this is no real big improvement in mana effeciency, just a big reduction in danger when root-bombing mobs to death.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It IS a big deal. Great, Druids can solo easier now. I honestly don't care.<P>*cough* class envy *cough*<P>Once when I was in my mid 20's I was joking about how difficult it was for me (a Rogue) to solo blues. A Druid told me he was the same level as I was and had just soloed a yellow. Did I care? No. Good for him, he can level quickly, I'm not gonna start asking for Rogues to be able to solo yellows or for Druids to be nerfed.<P>I used to play a Druid too. Hardly ever anymore, soloing is boring, and I hate being a caster in groups.

Snare it, root it, DoT it, take some distance, med.  When root break, get off your ass fast , run a bit, resnare or if you are real confident, reroot.  But I prefer to resnare just to be sure if root dont stick.  the repeat and rinse!<P>This patch will only take the resnare part away.<P>See ya!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ah Priest... what to say.  Outdoors I have more speed than just about any MOB in the game.  I can Root and rot quite comfortably without the MOB being snared anyways.  If I feel concerned at all, I just mem a fast cheap snare in the worst situations.  (Generally, I can easily pop one root off before the MOB is even close anyways.)  I can most certainly get a snare off between the time root pops and the time the critter is on me.  Sure, I might need to run and cast a few times but wth?  These critters can't kill me in a single swipe anyways.<P>Sure, snare underlying the root is a perk but hardly a major one for the Druid who solos in this way.  Frankly, I find RnR soloing to be boring anyways.  I'll group given the opportunity and I am sure that my mates will be happy that we can use both root and snare.  Of course, they need to tweak the code a bit and get it working first. :)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Actually this enhancement doesn't really effect Necros much at all.  Necros very seldom use root since the Mob is feared and the pet is constantly hitting which would break root anyway.<P>Feared Mobs always took full DoT damage which was as intended since Necros were designed to solo and Druids were not.  That said, Druids have become much better soloers than necros hands down which is why over 30% of the average server are druids.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I'm afraid you are mistaken about the impact this change has.  Others have explained it and you've ignored it, but I will attempt to clear things up.<P>The current technique works thusly:<P>1.  Root your victim.<BR>2.  Dot the mob.<BR>3.  Meditate.<BR>4.  Reapply Root when it breaks.<BR>5.  Reapply dot.<BR>6.  Mob dies, start back at 1 with new mob.<P>What you are saying is that we will now do this:<P>1.  Snare your victim.<BR>2.  Root your victim.<BR>3.  Apply dot.<BR>4.  Meditate.<BR>5.  Reapply root when it breaks.<BR>6   Reapply dot.<BR>7.  Mob dies, start back at 1.<P>Now, how did our game change?  Well, you added an extra step that's really not all that beneficial.  You forget that we already meditate 20 yards away from the mob.  Since we have sow at our disposal, the mob will not catch us, snared or not.  This is the same for a shaman, as well, since they can also sit 20 yards away and they possess sow.  No competent player who uses the root/dot method need ever get hit unless the mob they are fighting moves faster than sow.  That is the only time a druid will have an advantage, since a druid can snare.  <P>The REAL benefit of this fix, in my opinion, is actually that it minimizes the damage done by idiots who root snared mobs in dungeons.  Invariably, there will be someone who does not realize the benefits of snare and thus roots the mob I've already snared.  When root breaks, the mob gets away and it brings back 23904 of its closest friends.  This is usually followed by the idiot who rooted demanding to know why the heck I didn't snare. :P  Then I have to choke him and that's unfortunate.  As a grouping druid, I am thrilled about this change.<P>--Sarra<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It seems you disagree with me.  If you can post why you think I am mistaken, I will be pleased to point out anything you didn't understand.  There is limited benefit to this in a soloing sense, but phenomenal benefit in a grouping sense.  The only thing this does when root/dotting is give you a little more leeway to get things rooted again, but that's leeway you have simply by casting SoW already.  It's convenient, perhaps, but not stellar.  I wouldn't bother with 90% of encounters, but whether I do or not, it's only a discrepancy of 35 mana either way.  This is very minor, you're vastly overreacting.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hrm, I see what you're saying.  The less room is true, however, there is little to no difference in mana efficiency.  A mob has a finite number of hit points and the mana used to kill that mob will be the same every time no matter how much room it takes, with only resists factoring in for variation.  <P>This might make things easier in a dungeon, perhaps.  But there are VERY few dungeons where you can isolate a mob enough to root/dot it.  In a dungeon situation, you might get hit some, but you really don't have to worry about that too much because you have chloroplast going, or even just plain SLN if you wish to conserve mana.  Mana for healing isn't really a factor.<P>The only time I root/dotted indoors was in Nurga around level 40ish, and that worked well.  Snare working this way would have made it a little more convenient, but it was still doable, and easily so, without it.  I might, on average, have saved 200 mana every 30-60 minutes, because I would not have had to cast Chloroplast.  I don't think it would have streamlined the process much more, since it would in effect give me one more root each hour.  <P>I see what you're saying, and I'd be thrilled if I thought this was going to give me a huge advantage, but I think convenience and a slight improvement for indoors root/dotting is going to be about the extent of it, from a soloing perspective.  FYI, I think bards are better soloers, too.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>--Sarra<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

They 'fix' snare+root but in turns reversing the effect of a patch they put in a while ago.<P>Sure druids and necros have been DoT and rooting things for eon, but now that root doesn't overwrite snare, it just make kiting a little easier.<P>If you remember correctly, they put in the 2/3 dmg when a DoTed mob moves penalty to discourage people from kiting, ie. solo'ing, cuz they want people to group more.<P>Now with this 'fix' they are actually slaming themselves in their face and make kiting easier, and less penalized.

I am not sure what part of that is confusing people, but the two techniques are pretty much exact opposites.  This change to snare doesn't affect kiting.  It affects root/dotting.

Not changed, as to use a root method on these mobs just wont work, and your on to snare kite (with the dam loss). Also remmber you do more dam if the mobs running away from you, this was a nerf that I didnt like but realised it was only fair. (ps animal fear comes in handy when used right)<P>So as for this being a BIGGIE unbalanced change, its not, its a major grp safty valve and trust me, it will save you countless CRs deep in some bad place when some dorf roots a snared mob and it then goes to find friends ;-)<P>trust me this is a grp friendly NON neft !!!

</FONT><HR><BR>I have always rooted though since they fixed root. I never saw there being a kiting nerf, since they fixed root, since I have never "kited" since then.<P>Root + snare is not kiting heaven, since I am not kiting. I am rooting.<P>Yes, I like this chage (my gosh that stupid ad at the top playing something from that jim carry film just lagged the holy tunare out of me, remove that please) very, very much. Why do I like it? Because it simply makes it easier for me to stand up and root the thing again when root breaks. I don't get hit a couple times in the process possibly (which is negligable anyway.. at most its like 112 damage when I have 1300 hp.. I heal it up again after the thing is rooted just by having SLN on (oh and high level passing clerics.. stop buffing me you cover up SLN's regen though you are good intentioned I know)) <P>So this just makes snaring a rooting a little easier. It makes it more controlled. Control is a good thing. It benefits me and other players in the area also. Having a loose giant chasing me I have to resnare then reroot is bad for me as well as little billy who I might happen to pass while running accidently.<P>Biggest thing wrong with your post? They obviously wanted it this way since they changed it, and said that the original way was in fact a bug. This is part of an improvement to the game not only for a druid, but for any snare type spells combined with root. It makes class combos like druid grouping with a Wiz actually really DOABLE for the very first time. The druid can spend its mana on doting and just ensnaring the mob once, the wiz can root, nuke and reroot if the thing starts to move.<P>This is a GOOD change. It makes it more controlled when a druid is alone (again is easier for them but also benefits anyone in the surrounding 3 state area) AND it makes a wizard a MUCH more welcome addition to several party combos. I think that is something that a lot of people are not considering. This will end up being as much of a benefit to wizards as druids.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Only read the thread about halfway through so if someone already brought this up I apologize.<P>Here's my take from having played a druid to 48 mostly solo through his whole career (been retired from the druid for about a year now.)<P>For solo'ing this is somewhat helpful at most.  Most druids quad-kite anyway so it doesn't really matter in that perspective.  Until later levels when you are back to root/dot method because mobs just have too many HP's.  But druids could solo before and they can still solo now so what's the big deal.  This at most saves them maybe getting hit one or two times but that's about it.<P>Any druid worth his salt as a kiter could solo before the patch and will see this as a minor improvement at best.<P>Now where I see the advantage every where else is in root parking.  Now say you pull a mob and the druid snares it.  The wizard gets a little over-zealous and nukes too hard.  Before this change you would either have to pray the tank can taunt it off or park it and hope root doesn't break just before it takes off and trains you.<P>Now, you can root it and not worry a bit.  This is a GREAT change for groups.  It helps everyone sooo much in the given scenario and makes root parking sooo much safer.<P>Everyone complains how enc are the only crowd control well now druids, rangers, and combinations of necro + rooting class can do crowd control just as well as a chanter.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This doesn't help rooting druids all that much, for soloing.  With SOW, a druid can do the root/DOT/med cycle in such a way that even when root is resisted, the mob doesn't get to them, giving them time to try again.<P>The class it really helps is soloing Wizards.  We kite very well with DD spells.  Bonds of Force, then repeat run/nuke 4 or 5 times.  Our biggest risk is when BoF is resisted.  Before the patch, in that case there were two choices.  (1) root and switch to root/nuke for that mob, or (2) hit the mob with Tishan's Clash (5 second stun), and then try BoF again while it is stunned.  Without a SOW, #1 has a lot of risk.  #2 is better without SOW, but if Tishan's gets resisted, it has a very long recycle time, so you end up strafe-running for the zone, or switching to #1.<P>After the patch (once they repatch and fix it!), when BoF is resisted, Wizards will root, then try BoF again.  Root works better than Tishan's for this, because it casts faster, and has a much smaller recycle time.  Every soloing Wizard past level 15 has learned to root a mob while it is beating on him.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Mage's should like this...<P>As to the Druid Perspective (from a druid) ...<P>Probably won't change my Root and DoT pattern that much ....<P>With almost any MoB I am Soloing with Root-N-DoT, I root back-away, DoT, and Med at the edge of sight.<P>Root breaks I stand and cast ... it it holds I back up and re-med, if it breaks I still have time to run back and re-try (this attempt is harder but can still do 100% with almost all mob, just run until out of casting range stop and sart casting until it comes into range).<P>Nope for the days I am feeling like the bar isn't moving and really want to try to get closer to my next rank of spells, I will do the same old same old, probably won't waste the small amount of mana on the snare or ensare ...<P><BR>So while it does add a little extra saftey, it is not a MAJOR increase if you hunted a little cautiously...<P><BR>Although It will be much nicer for in groups as Root can still be used for crowd control better, since even if root breaks the mob will be snared and you will have more time to re-root or move him away again.<P>I see Mobs with stacked Root and Snare far far more common in grouped dungeon enviroments than solo kiting.<P>Amicus Aidbringer, Druid of Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/046544-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/046544-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/046544-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=046544&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=046544&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
