</FONT><HR>Wow, I can't even imagine the dejection or rage i would develop if this happened to me.  That you can be polite and detailed in your post speaks volumes to me about your integrity.  A person exploiting this bug would probably show up here ranting and raving trying to get attention and maybe guilt them into helping.  All you appear to be asking for is what was yours to begin with and indeed must have proven was yours hence the first issue.  Verant says they will not assist in quests yet by admission of the lead-Gm... these said pearls HAVE been issued already (hard to exploit if they NEVER assist in epic quests isnt it?)  <P>    Verant also stated on many occasions that the EXP penalty will never be removed.  thats the beauty about "rules".... They can be altered to fit/improve the game.  I think this is another instance where a rule could be "bent" to the betterment of the game.  Give the cleric her pearl Verant.... you already know she deserves it... yes it will prompt counterpoints (im still boggled to see people complaining about exp penalty removal)  You cant make everyone happy... at least make the honest people happy please.<P>You have my support.<P>Prezley Hounddog<BR>48 Ranger of E'ci<BR>Vigil Borealis<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor has started a new thread on the topic of Ragefire poofing.<P>In essence, he says that Verant has been unable to duplicate the problem, but will be making some coding changes in the next patch that may make a difference.<P>They are asking folks to tell them if Ragefire continues to poof.<P>Since Ragefire poofing has not been admitted to be a bug, the shimmering pearl you use to spawn him will not be refunded if he poofs.  And Verant hasn't been able to duplicate the poofing, so they have no clue whether anything is really wrong.  Therefore, the "fixes" they are applying are somewhat random guesses.<P>Does any of this encourage any clerics out there to risk their shimmering pearl?  <P>&lt;&lt; silence &gt;&gt;<P>Good one, Verant  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Paeter</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>zeddgara excuse the flame but you obviously speak from ignorance. <P>If you had ever been on an 'epic' proportion raid you would know the amount of lag that is induced by having 30+ players crammed into a small room all getting hit by AE damage breath weapons, fear,  not to mention overload of polygons on your screen from so many people there.<P>People who partake in these raids take every step to reduce lag as much as possible, turning down every option, facing away from the battle if your a healer etc, but the fact is *MANY* linkdeaths occur during these types of battles due to their very large nature regardless of the precations we as players take.  Therefore it is not far fetched to think that a linkdead player could land the killing blow twice in a row.<P>However all of the above is inconsequential when teamed with the information that Verant has logs of what has occured on their servers. Therefore the burden of proof can not rely upon me as a player because any 'proof' that I am able to submit they can claim "is easily doctored" such as screen shots or client logs. <P>I contend that the GM's in question did not check the log the second time because they felt it was 'highly unlikely' exactly as you do. However unlikely something is does not make it impossible. This kind of attitude leads to the incredibly poor customer service I have received to date. I am a long term customer with a valid complaint, all I am asking is that Verant perform their due dilligance and properly investigate the matter and reimburse when they have verified what I say is true.<P>zeddgara your idle and uninformed speculation here does little to help the situation and I encourage you to think before you post next time.<P>Badina <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Spuff_Eci ; the problem you report is a well known one by power leveling players. <P>Basically the game will not give anyone credit for a kill if no player has done any damage. Damage shields do not count as YOU doing damage. <P>As you noticed when you were able to actually hit the monster you got credit for the kill. The times that you did not hit the monster and only the damage shield was responsible for damage on it no one got the kill.<P>Other than to prevent power leveling I personally dont see any practical use for this kind of poofing that your asking about but thats outside the scope of this thread perhaps you should take the question to the QA / Testing forum and see if they feel this is how it was meant to be?<P>Badina</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>My heart goes out to the folks who were affected by this tragedy.  /prays<P>But what worries/bothers me more is the fact that Verant Customer Support just assumes that many/most/all players are dishonest.  That is an insult to me and hopefully every person involved in this game.  And as a business practice, it's unheard of.<P>In customer service, it is FAR better to err on the side of the customer than it is to err against them.  Ask how many folks who were unjustly wronged if they will buy any more Verant games in the future.  /waits   You will see the powerful effects of this poor business practice in years to come when marketshares drop and profits dwindle.<P>To the Customer Support (or lack thereof) folks at Verant, I ask only one thing of you.  Please try to treat people (aka your clients) the way you yourself would like to be treated. You do it in real life when you are at home with the wife/hubby/friends/kids, you should do it during business hours, too. <P>It's easy to be a butthole. It takes almost no effort most of the time.

</FONT><HR>Daku_Inochi:<P>"But what worries/bothers me more is the fact that Verant Customer Support just assumes that many/most/all players are dishonest. "<P>This worries me as well, and it is definitely the case.  I *know* that we weren't trying to pull a fast one, but how do you know that?  Or the Verant support person (GM, Lead GM, or otherwise)?<P>I would hope that the Verant staff have some effective tools to help them determine the truth of a situation.  However, this does not seem to be the case, or the Verant staff are not briefed in how to use those tools, or they are simply lazy.  If logs are maintained, it should have been possible for the Verant staff to simply see that Ragefire died, no one looted the corpse, and no corpse was to be found.  The corpse of Zoradek was still there (we left it in place to prove we had killed him and spawned the dragon), so that much of our story was easily observable.<P>But...even if the tools don't exist, what book of customer service tells you to automatically assume the customer is trying to scam you?  If 5% of the customer population is pulling a fast one, or even 10%, or even 20%, that still means 80% or more are honestly suffering from a problem through no fault of their own.<P>Yet, as this incident illustrates, the customer is assumed to be in the wrong.<P>How sad.<P>Paeter</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, I feel more than obligated to post on Badina's thread. I have held off because there really wasn't much I could offer.<P>Absor started a Ragefire thread.<P>But, I returned to this thread and I am seeing a negative turn and an uninformed turn seep into this thread. And Ragefire thread is lacking because it does not address the issue Badina has brought up in this thread.<P>There is a strong focus on the term "highly unlikely" and that is the basis of judgement by the GM in this case.<P>Allow me to illustrate why "highly unlikely" is an absurd connotation.<P>"Highly Unlikely" in terms of the overall population of EQ would be the probability of Ragefire poofing for the exact same person twice in succession given all of the players online and all of the encounters and all of the NPC's. It is an abstract number and thought and has no relevance.<P>The likelyhood of Regfire's corpse poofing is based solely on the number of participants attacking Ragefire that are linkdead against the number of players attacking Ragefire that are not linkdead. This does not count people that are sitting down and not attacking. If they went linkdead they would continue to sit down until they disappeared. If Ragefire attacked they would not defend themselves. They would just stand there and get hit.<P>It isn't possible to determine the probability of someone going linkdead. It happens. We all know it happens and we can all accept the fact that it does happen.<P>So we are now only concerned about the individuals that are engaging Ragefire. These are the only individuals that are going to contribute to Ragefire poofing.<P>Ragefire will poof only if the tiny miniscule of damage delivered at the end is the one that puts the damage hits over the top to declare Ragefire dead. Only that one tiny little hit at that one instance.<P>We are dealing with strictly one instance in time. In this case it is with at most 30 people attacking (assuming every single person is attacking and some aren't bothering to keep their party members alive). That is also absurd.<P>If just one person in this crowd goes linkdead, then the probability of Ragefire poofing is 1 person against 29 people. In attacks it is 1 attack out of 30.<P>2 people and it is 2 chances out of 30.<P>No way can the occurence of Ragefire poofing be considered highly unlikely. No way can any corpse poofing be considered highly unlikely if there is a linkdead member of the party attacking.<P>The problems of poofing are traced only to that one tiny last killing blow.<P>Let's stop the absurd declarations of "highly unlikely."<P>Customer Service will fall somewhere between "acceptable" and "assinine". I know which end of the spectrum it should be leaning towards.
