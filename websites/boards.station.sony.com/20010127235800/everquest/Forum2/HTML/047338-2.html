</FONT><HR># Actually, it's EXACTLY like a cop arresting you on suspicion of a crime. #<P>No, it isn't.<P>In the real world, cops have to arrest people because if they didn't, the suspects could well be in hiding when it came time to have the trial.  Or at the very least, they need to be taken in to the station house in order to be conclusively ID'ed (fingerprints, etc.) and questioned.<P>NONE of that applies to EQ.<P>Your character's identity is not in question.  Nor is his location -- he's right there on the servers, and he can't escape or "go underground".<P>In a world where everyone's existence and identity was registered with the "authorities", and the government had the ability to summon anyone at will to the police station for questioning, or the courtroom for judgement, or the jailhouse for sentencing, there would be no NEED for arrest.<P>So since EQ is such a world, why is Verant "arresting" people for mere suspicion?  Actually, being summoned to be asked some questions is more like being arrested.  What Verant is doing is more analogous to throwing people in jail and refusing bail until they get around to having a trial.<P>Furthermore, the EULA gives Verant a blanket "wiretap and search warrant" for everyone in their world.  They could get more results in less time by letting the suspects continue their activities, closely monitored to catch them in the act of committing another "crime", as opposed to suspending them and then trying to sweat a confession out of them.<P>So it raises the question of whether it's being the way it is in order to feed someone's need for a powertrip, since it appears that just catching and punishing the guilty could be done more effectively by other means.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>This investigation is going on far too long for this process.  This is ridiculous that it hasn't been completed by now.  It was bad enough that the GM instigated the suspension just as he leaves for vacation or his days off, but to not have it completed by now?  An indefinite suspension because they can't get their act together?  C'mon guys, that's not acceptable!<P>As for the original post being closed, not surprising.  Although Fornicus and others are claiming no response by Verant was requested, that is erroneous.  I'm surprised they left it up as long as they did, for it degenerated into nothing but a flamefest of Verant, while people kept whining about a lack of response on the board.  Never gonna get a response on the board, so the demands for one were silly.<P>Fornicus:  I hope you get your account back soon!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>OK... here's what happens in the real world with large deposits.  This is coming from someone who worked in banking for 8 years.  With cash deposits and withdrawals, banks have a certain cash limit.  Banks keep these numbers confidential and so will I. If you go over those limits, you are required to fill out a form for the IRS stating where the money is coming from, and a LOT of personal information.  Also, if you find out what that limit is, and deposit a dollar less than that, you're still probably going to end up filling out a form because it's a suspicious transaction.  <P>Not that this has anything to do with the way EQ runs, but with all the posts referring to RL situations I thought I'd add my 2 cents.  I see no problem in EQ if they "audit" your EQ account to see where you got the pp from, but I don't think that suspending it is the right thing to do.  If they find out you got the money through duping they're just going to cancel your account anyways, so what difference does it make if you're still using the account during the "audit" time?    *shrug*   I realize you could go and trade all your pp and items to other people, but EQ could track that too.  I imagine in these cases they suspend a lot more accounts that got their money "legally", than ones that dupe.<P>Dorla Stincfinger<BR>29th cleric - Xegony<BR>will probably NEVER have 250kpp, heh.    <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Should they let the economy of the server be screwed up for the convenience of one person who can't get into his account for (so far) five days?

However, to do this before the GM splits for a few days, and not have anyone else follow up on the investigation, is inexcusable.  It is stupid that it is taking this long.

</FONT><HR>Airtreader, I never said it didn't suck to be him, but the only other option they have is potentially inconveniencing many more people.<P>I doubt that that GM is the only one who can investigate the situation, either.<P>And, fornicus, ok, it's a little different since the accounts didn't get deleted.  Still, with people claiming their accounts have been hacked and their characters stripped, along with the duping problem rearing its ugly head again, this action still doesn't seem totally out of line to me when it's such an isolated occurrence.<P>Also, your outrage is probably the main thing keeping you from getting information.  Many people, if not most, will feel that communicating with you is a lost cause.  They can't imagine that any information they will give you will help, so they find it far easier to ignore your progress requests.<P>So far, you've been out your account five days, and you should be compensated for time paid but not played.  They owe you $1.60 so far.  This is fair, and I wouldn't think it unreasonable to give you a free month or something when they whole mess is over... *if* they find no evidence of shady dealings, that is.<P>Still, you're more likely to get a resolution and compensation if you manage your outrage and seek to cooperate in finding a solution.  Stirring up a lot of trouble on the boards will only identify you as an unreasonable person who is wasting their time with your demands.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Actually, here's two things about just taking the plat and leaving him in the game:<P>(1) Oh, and he wouldn't be just as outraged, if not moreso?  Rather than just freezing his account, and not touching anything, they go dipping into his bank account and take away what's his?<P>(2) There's a chance that, if he is in league with dupers knowingly or unknowingly, he may not have out-of-game communications with them.  Therefore, keeping him out of the game prevents him from "tipping them off."

</FONT><HR>Xelene, when you call and email and get no response you are going to go someplace where you can.  And he has been civil and mannerly, and what VI has done is an outrage.  I hope they freeze your account for a couple weeks, just so you can still whimper on about how he is just whining.  He had money, and he just wants to play the game he is paying to play.  If VI comunicated in anything resembling reasonable manner they wouldnt get half the complaints they do, but they cant seem to manage that for the life of em.<P>BTW, freezing his account to me makes no sense what so ever.<P>1.  If your worry is that he might continue to make money if he was duping, well he still can, just create another account.<P>2.  If your worry is that he will take the "duped" money that he had and spread that around to others, well he can just as easily create another account and spread that newly duped money around, and if he was duping, you just gave him an incentive (anger) to do exactly that.<P>VI gains little from freezing his account, and doing so without proof but just because "hey your bank account is too big" is no reason at all.  I would rather have a world full of dupers then a world run by people who would do that.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

You haven't listed the average level of characters on the account so verant may be sifting through hours of back logs to see if either a the items were duped or the money or both or if you did get these items ligitimately.  You are crying for moral outrage at verants actions towards your acount with only one side of the story and due to legal reasons we can not hear the other side.  I have seen a lot of these verant banned my account and I did nothing wrong posts but until verant can legally come in and state exactly why they did what was done then we have to assume that the actions were what was necessary.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Guys, its simple. Heres an example. Guy comes to FP and auctions an item. Guy says he wants 20K for it. Give the guy 20K, get item. Everyone off on their merry way. Little did the guy know that many others will pay 80K for that item. Boom, just made 60K in a couple of minutes. You think this never happens? Guess again. Sure its a rare thing to make such a profit, but when you sit in NFP for 6 hrs a day, every now and then something like this pops up. But usually the trades are items that are 500p to 1K from average price, sometimes more. Just takes alot of time and patience but you can make good money. Off course, sometimes you end up holding an item for a long time before you sell it. Thats the risk you take. No one said its easy, but dam if some GM is gonna come and say, you've been to successful, other people complaining, I'm taking all your stuff that you have put so many hours in getting.<P>BTW, CoF sells for 100K or more. Cobalt BP and legs could fetch about 100K or more each. Runed Ornate Shield, about 40K. Runed Branded Girdle about 75K. Imbued Granite Spaulders 80K. FBSS about 10K. Tranquil Staff about 80K. Lamentations about 15K. Gebs about 10K. HBC 8K. PAW 6K. You get the point.<P>Making small trades here and there, getting good deals, etc...can eventually land you one of the uber items. Little by little you can easily accumulate alot of cash. Just gets boring fast sitting there all day.<P>I wish I had the 800K, I would have been on the next flight over so they could tell me to my face they were banning me for making too much money.<P>Valryte Azmyth</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
