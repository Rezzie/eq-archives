</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>     First, after looking at some of the topics of the general board, I must say that I feel your pain!  Too many rude frickers.<BR>     <BR>     Please, see Thantu's note.  He almost always hits the points that are important to me, and, I imagine, many other shammies.<P>     I too am frustrated by the shaman changes in general and this one did feel like the proverbial straw.  I was/am considering quitting if this melee oriented ability of our class is not well replaced.  (I know...don't let the door hit me on the way out:  play another class and stop whining..I'd rather get a new game) <P>      I know this is not really any of my business, but you might want to remind your superiors that many of the adult EQ community are <BR>educated, independent minded people, to whom a spun, badly supported position is especially antagonizing.  Next time they tell you that a spell that is inferior to every other competing spell in accomplishing the goal of staying alive and gaining xp is USEFUL (for having fun trying new things?..for soloing greens? hee hee I can't believe they made you say that  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> ) please remind them that some (few?) of the EQ community can chew our own food.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have a shaman on two servers, one high teens the other 50s.  I have read a lot of flack from the shaman community about class nerfing, and I have read a lot of flak from Verant about shaman community whining (displaying rude behavior?).  Central to the theme is the vision.  My perception is that the shaman community is communicating how the vision is changing, while the verant community is steadfastly defending their changes as retaining vision.  What then, is the vision?<P>MY OPINION - I knew it as a class that was among the few that could solo, though the least effective of the few.  I knew it as a class that offered to the group a unique and powerful support role - offering world class slows and dots (offensive) with some healing and buffing ability (supportive).  Here's my point - we could solo, but not well, and certainly not against Kunark grade mobs.  So our strongest point was in group play where we were considered the best all-around caster class.  This is what I thought the vision to be.<P>These are many of the complaints from the shaman community which they feel have changed the vision of our class:<P>Took away Charm.<BR>Took away 49 damage shield.<BR>Put level cap on Befriend Animal.<BR>DoT nerf (reduced damage for nothing in return).<BR>Targor's and 49 Strength nerfed for Kunark coding.<BR>Rage line nerfed for Velious coding.<BR>Alchemy was BROKEN for 8 months.<BR>Cannibalize line degrades in efficiency, rather than improves as reward for increasing difficulty in obtaining higher lvl spells (can 2 is difficult kunark quest and can 3 is dungeon drop only).  This is particularly disturbing - the spell gets worse as the series progresses, rather than better, but the risks to obtain the series is increasingly more difficult.  I have a hard time with this one, personally.<BR>Indirect nerf of shaman quickness line when haste was repaired, not compensated.<BR>Spear of Fate - a fiasco.<BR>Cultural armor - lame.<P>We could never heal as good as a cleric, could never solo as good as a druid, nor could we ever do something as definitely desired by other classes as resurrection or teleportation.  Without a crystal clear class advantage, it was our all around nature, coupled with the best slow, which gave us our identity in groups.  What I am trying to communicate to you about the vision of the shaman class is that this identity IS the vision, and that the changes identified above have continued to erode this identity.  What is in question now, when Verant mentions the term vision.....is just what is the vision?  What is the role intended for this class?  It continues to be a very poor solo class, and it has been made abundantly clear verant's global vision does not favor solo gameplay.  So no future in that aspect.  We are left then with group play, but what do we offer?<P>We do not tank well.<BR>We do not haste well.<BR>We do not heal well.<BR>We do not snare.<BR>We do not resurrect.<BR>We do not evac.<BR>We do not regenerate mana for any other class, and do not do it very well for self.<BR>We do not offer a viable summoned tank in the form of a pet.<BR>We DO offer buffs which unfortunately have a very minimal effect on combat performance, and are now replaced by weapon procs anyway.<BR>We DO offer a marginally better slow spell.<P>The core of our outrage, and why we seem to scream so much, is we don't know what we're supposed to be anymore.  What is our identity?  What is was, is gone now.  We are no longer the best "all arounders."  Now, we are a class left wondering what our contribution is supposed to be to a group, in a game environment which is decidedly group oriented.  Be the group for a second, and try to envision why you might want a shaman....why would a group ever say, "we have to have a shaman!"  For what reason would they say that?<P>I suggest it was once a perfectly made class.  It once had a clear vision, and lived up to it.  I suspect overconfidence that the Shaman class was "finished" allowed the chipping to begin...how could it hurt such a well balanced class?  Enough chips have been taken off to destroy what was once the vision of this class.  I believe there is no longer a vision in existence.<P>I challenge Verant to define the vision of the Shaman class as it exists today.  I challenge Verant to tell me why other classes would find a Shaman to be a desireable addition to their group?  I challenge Verant to face this issue, which has been the core issue in every stream of vitriol which accompanies every new shaman nerf.....I challenge Verant to not say "lets keep this to the specific issue at hand" and, finally, address the overall issue that it is THE SUM OF ALL THE CHANGES which is the issue, not just this one.  I challenge Verant to stop resting on their laurels, stop blindly believing they have some kind of viable vision still intact, and to EVALUATE AT A VISION/GLOBAL LEVEL the Shaman class.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well the word is out on the post-patch Rage line. Rage is fixed. The lower level versions (Frenzy and Fury), as reported on the Crucible, are not. Not sure what the last verdict on VotB was.<P>Well I'm impressed with the quick response, but disappointed that it was half-assed. What about the shamans who are too low level to have Rage? We use the lower level versions too ya know.<P>Also the new rage stats are +50str +53dex +30AC and lasts ~15min. The regen is being debated on and the haste part is beginning to get mentioned. <P>I think that Thantu brought up a good question will this be the final version of the spell? Will the others in the line be modified to follow suit?<P>Also I think that the spell, as is, needs improving. A big, big, big, and allow me once more to stress big, part of the Rage line previously was the regen aspect. We are shamans and as much as we try our AC will oftentimes be less than needed to effectively tank mobs. Regen and slow in combonation make up for that and with a lot of "Rage Hunting" the big part of rage was the Regen it offered in addition to regrowth. Stat buffs are negligible in combat. The AC is good, but I think we would really like to see ATK, haste and Regen, ideally, on rage. I also realize that there are issues with this on a spell with a duration like 15min. Please keep in mind though to keep it all reasonable. Use your judgement to put into effect what the spirit of the spell was pre-nerf.<P>Also, last but not least, the whole way this was brought about. I cannot get over how sloppily done this was. I mean what caused the coding change? Was it the new Paladin SoV line? I mean really sacrifice our line which has been in the game since day one for their line which they don't even get yet? Also on the issue of draining non-existent mana as is the case in this spell; how is necros draining non-existent hit points off level 1 mobs with their DoT life tap ANY different? Really can you see any difference? I can't, but maybe I'm overlooking something. If you present a reasonable fact that I'm overlooking that makes these 2 situations dissimilar, I will let this argument drop, but until then I don't see how the necro line could even possibly fit within the bounds of this new "you can't drain stuff that doesn't exist" rule.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Addressing the problem with the Rage spell so quickly was a very good thing.  The lack of additional regen at the higher levels probably doesn't make that much of a difference as there are spells/items available to the Shaman which give a decent regen effect, so the loss of regen from the higher level spells of this line won't be missed terribly.<P>I would like to remind whoever is making the changes to the spell line that at the level which shaman get frenzy(19), this is their only HP regen ability(unless they are heavily twinked) until they get regeneration at 24.  From level 19 through 23, the shaman has great difficulty soloing due to relatively weak offensive spells(crummy disease Dots) they have at that level.  <P>Removing the regen element from the Frenzy spell in particular, will hurt the lower level shaman more than removing HP regen from Rage will hurt higher level shaman. So please consider any changes to this line carefully and please test any changes you make and weigh the pros and cons at various levels.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I hope the version put on the live servers now is NOT the final version. Rage without the regen component is not the Rage we know and love.<P>I don't understand Verant can't just add a different type of mana drain effect, using the OLD mana drain effect, and assign it to Rage. I don't see how it's acceptable to nerf existing spells just so you can give Paladins a mana-based regen spell in Velious. I thought Velious was about increasing versatility, not nerfing a way to play.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Let me clarify part of that second paragraph.<P>Why can't you just<BR>1) dig up the source code for the mana drain before the 11/15 patch<BR>2) add a new type of spell effect<BR>3) paste said code in<BR>4) assign effect to rage<P>Spell doesn't change, new mana drain still exists for upcoming spells.<P>I have a hard time believing that all of a sudden you folks at Verant decided that the mana drain effect needs to be changed. The Rage spell was thought out and designed way back when. Why now decided that it shouldn't stay the way it used to?<P>Allow me to present an analogy. I AM IN NO WAY ADVOCATING WHAT'S PRESENT IN THE ANALOGY.<P>Verant decides that since fire-based spells are resistable, game mechanics shouldn't allow for fire-based damage shield damage to be unresistable. So damage done by fire-based damage shields is reduced (and druid damage shields would be AC or MR dependent, to keep things even).<P>What is the logic behind this change? Ok, sure, the reason of game mechanics is presented. So? Was this not considered back in EverQuest's design phase? Should all the planning and balancing done back then be totally disregarded?

It is the regen component that made this spell anything other than toilet paper.<P>I dont know who is more pathetic, VI for constantly butchering this class or fellow shamans for thanking them for doing it.<P>It is the regeneration component and only the regeneration component that was worth anything, and only because it stacked with out other regeneration effects.<P>Notice its the only thing they removed?  In the situations I would use the Frenzy line I definitely have zero use for this useless spell.  The only use for this spell now is for the shamans working on blacksmithing.  How very sad.<P>Its not about running out of mana at all, the issue is Shamans even having a mediocre form of healing just ourselves is reason enough for them to butcher the spell.

</FONT><HR>I love my Shaman.<BR>VI makes a heck of a game.<P>With that in mind...I have to say that the post by RuinRaider is by far the best post I have ever seen.  It clearly summarizes my feelings of the Shaman class as it has evolved.  Each little change to the class has piled up to effect a major change to all Shaman.<P>Please consider RuinRaider's post.  Thank you.<P>RuinRaider posted 11-29-2000 07:25 PM            <BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>I have a shaman on two servers, one high teens the other 50s. I have read a lot of flack from the shaman community about class nerfing, and I have read a lot of flak from Verant about shaman community whining (displaying rude behavior?). Central to the theme is the vision. My perception is that the shaman community is communicating how the vision is changing, while the verant community is steadfastly defending their changes as retaining vision. What then, is the vision?<BR>MY OPINION - I knew it as a class that was among the few that could solo, though the least effective of the few. I knew it as a class that offered to the group a unique and powerful support role - offering world class slows and dots (offensive) with some healing and buffing ability (supportive). Here's my point - we could solo, but not well, and certainly not against Kunark grade mobs. So our strongest point was in group play where we were considered the best all-around caster class. This is what I thought the vision to be.<P>These are many of the complaints from the shaman community which they feel have changed the vision of our class:<P>Took away Charm.<BR>Took away 49 damage shield.<BR>Put level cap on Befriend Animal.<BR>DoT nerf (reduced damage for nothing in return).<BR>Targor's and 49 Strength nerfed for Kunark coding.<BR>Rage line nerfed for Velious coding.<BR>Alchemy was BROKEN for 8 months.<BR>Cannibalize line degrades in efficiency, rather than improves as reward for increasing difficulty in obtaining higher lvl spells (can 2 is difficult kunark quest and can 3 is dungeon drop only). This is particularly disturbing - the spell gets worse as the series progresses, rather than better, but the risks to obtain the series is increasingly more difficult. I have a hard time with this one, personally.<BR>Indirect nerf of shaman quickness line when haste was repaired, not compensated.<BR>Spear of Fate - a fiasco.<BR>Cultural armor - lame.<P>We could never heal as good as a cleric, could never solo as good as a druid, nor could we ever do something as definitely desired by other classes as resurrection or teleportation. Without a crystal clear class advantage, it was our all around nature, coupled with the best slow, which gave us our identity in groups. What I am trying to communicate to you about the vision of the shaman class is that this identity IS the vision, and that the changes identified above have continued to erode this identity. What is in question now, when Verant mentions the term vision.....is just what is the vision? What is the role intended for this class? It continues to be a very poor solo class, and it has been made abundantly clear verant's global vision does not favor solo gameplay. So no future in that aspect. We are left then with group play, but what do we offer?<P>We do not tank well.<BR>We do not haste well.<BR>We do not heal well.<BR>We do not snare.<BR>We do not resurrect.<BR>We do not evac.<BR>We do not regenerate mana for any other class, and do not do it very well for self.<BR>We do not offer a viable summoned tank in the form of a pet.<BR>We DO offer buffs which unfortunately have a very minimal effect on combat performance, and are now replaced by weapon procs anyway.<BR>We DO offer a marginally better slow spell.<P>The core of our outrage, and why we seem to scream so much, is we don't know what we're supposed to be anymore. What is our identity? What is was, is gone now. We are no longer the best "all arounders." Now, we are a class left wondering what our contribution is supposed to be to a group, in a game environment which is decidedly group oriented. Be the group for a second, and try to envision why you might want a shaman....why would a group ever say, "we have to have a shaman!" For what reason would they say that?<P>I suggest it was once a perfectly made class. It once had a clear vision, and lived up to it. I suspect overconfidence that the Shaman class was "finished" allowed the chipping to begin...how could it hurt such a well balanced class? Enough chips have been taken off to destroy what was once the vision of this class. I believe there is no longer a vision in existence.<P>I challenge Verant to define the vision of the Shaman class as it exists today. I challenge Verant to tell me why other classes would find a Shaman to be a desireable addition to their group? I challenge Verant to face this issue, which has been the core issue in every stream of vitriol which accompanies every new shaman nerf.....I challenge Verant to not say "lets keep this to the specific issue at hand" and, finally, address the overall issue that it is THE SUM OF ALL THE CHANGES which is the issue, not just this one. I challenge Verant to stop resting on their laurels, stop blindly believing they have some kind of viable vision still intact, and to EVALUATE AT A VISION/GLOBAL LEVEL the Shaman class.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>While we're grateful for the swift action taken, it's clear that some people like the new Rage and some don't.<P>Those who do seem to be the people that didn't really use it much before - they see the revised version as a new buff, and are happy.<P>Those who don't realise how important the Regen component was for keeping you alive in these last-stand situations.<P>This revised Rage has changed the concept of the spell. Instead of a "finish this enemy off or go down fighting" spell, it's just a self-only buff. A nice one, but it no longer simulates the effects of going into a berskerker fury, shrugging off wounds but unable to focus long enough to cast.<P>Without meaning to sound like I'm complaining - I'm glad this was responded to so quickly - it does seem like little attention was paid to the descriptions from shamans of how the spell was actually being used, and what it was originally intended to be.<P>Could we possibly get some official feedback on whether further modifications will be considered?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Make it cost no mana but prevents casting of any spells for a minute after using it. (For the shaman to calm down to an extent that he can think to be able to think to a degree to cast spells)<P>3. Make it cost no mana but instead of preventing spells being cast afterwards...have the spell only available when the shaman gets low on mana, hence gets enraged.<P>Personally I like 2, with the calming aspect of the spell (afterall they are inraged)anyhow..gives your people some ideas.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I play a level 54 shaman on Xegony, and my opinion on this is that while the new version of Rage is interesting, it is not really in the spirit of the original spell. If this is open for discussion, I would ask that the spell be returned to it's original state.<P>Instead of a situational spell I could cast when my mana was almost exhausted and retreat was not an option, I am left with what basically amounts to a general self only buffing spell. While certain components have been improved, noteably a boost to armor class, certain other components appear to have been removed (stackable regeration and a mild haste component)<P>Personally I would much prefer that the spell be returned to it's original form. I don't think it could be said to be very unbalancing. As I said above, it was a highly situational spell. It was not a spell you could cast and then gate out if you realized you were overmatched (because the spell drained your mana to 0). You might be able to run for the zone, depending on the situation, but that was all. <P>I will not say I used it all the time, but it was a great 'flavor' spell, and was sometimes useful in places where I was honor bound not to retreat.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Oh and on the pet issue..PLEASE make the mana cost something reasonable. All classes agree this is not a reasonable cost for the pet..especially given its lack of duel wield, and low level.<P>Or increase its fighting proficiency by giving duel bite and higher level.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree with RuinRaider.  <P>I am a mid-level Shaman and starting to lose my identity.  Especially in a group.  Why do people need me?  What is my defining role?<P><BR>Geez, the biggest thing that I look forward to is a new dot at lvl 39 and a fresh doggy to show to the newbies.<P>Gimme some Shaman spells to look foward to Verant Interactive, or just go ahead and turn me into a druid. At least that way I can tele to my corpse.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

While certain components have been improved, noteably a boost to armor class, certain other components appear to have been removed (stackable regeration and a mild haste component)<P>It's my understanding that the new rage version has 3 hp per tick regen added.  And that this stacks with regrowth.  I don't know about you, but I'd rather have 3 hp per tick all the time then the old rage version.<P>The spell won't be an emergency spell anymore... but it is a very nice spell now.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, thanks again for the quick response.  Thanks again for listening.  <P>    I used this spell quite a bit when soloing.  I feel that only a regen effect will do for me, if that matters at all.  That was the main reason I used it.<P>     I do realize that this small change will not make being a shaman completely useless.  We are the only ones that get AOE slow and we have nice dots.<P>     However, this was my favorite spell for playing the shaman pseudo melee style...lay on the dots and debuffs  and a couple nukes, cast rage and get my hammer and join my pet.    <P> I am sorry if what I wrote earlier about hating spin crossed the line.  Not sure that it did, but sorry if it did offend you. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><P>I think the new Rage is better than the old Rage.<P>I do wish there was a bit more of an HP regen (take away the str and dex buffing portion - who cares about those).<P>I'm topping 907 AC self-buffed now.  That's cool.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Maybe use this time to increase our melee ablity? <P>Have the Rage/Fury line do what it does now PLUS a Extra attack(total of 3 attacks at 59), damage bonus and attack rating.   What I am getting at is for as long as we have mana to put into the spell let us fight as a warrior fights (without dual weld) till the mana runs out.      <P>This would give the shaman the choice to:<BR>A) cast all mana and then med <BR>b)cast this spell and tank to the end <P>Just a suggestion.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034888-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034888.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034888-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034888-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/034888-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=034888&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=034888&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
