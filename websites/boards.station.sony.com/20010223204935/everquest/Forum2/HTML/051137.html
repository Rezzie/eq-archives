</FONT><HR>I also like the tradeskills and am disappointed that some things don't work exactly like they are supposed to.<P>But, look at the huge amount of things that do work correctly.  Your list is I'm sure by no means everything that is broken or not exactly right, but still.<P>Especially considering that I doubt they have a lot of resources devoted to this area.  It just isn't as important as some of the other issues because it doesn't help/prevent people from leveling.<P>This is the part I wish they would fix.  Why can't we gain experience from doing tradeskills?  It would definitely gain a lot more attention from the bulk of the EQ populace if experience was gained as well as skill levels.<P>Just imagine all that time you spent working on smithing or jewelry.  I would say that a level 200 master should have earned at least a few experience points for all that hard work!<P>Anyway, I think it will get fixed eventually.  Just not real high on Verant's list it would appear.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Even ignoring the fact of the broken ones, trade skills are, for the most part, horribly worthless.  The only people who can really do most of them are high-lvels or twinks.  I had an Iksar war for a while, decided to take up smithing.  Bad idea.  *Flush* goes all my money, and I haven't even come close to making anything useful.  <P>I took up jewelcraft with my chanter a while back.  Was making some reasonable good stuff for my skill level, but then found out I couldn't make anything better till I gained more levels.  So it comes back to leveling.  Verant, just how badly are you trying to punish anyone who tries to do anything but kill things?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Not to mention the insane amount of plat used just to find out so many of these recipies are broken.  One day all the new cultral tailoring recipies were going in and Yakatizma was on great terms with the tradeskill board, and then when we get so many major screw ups and try and help out as much as possible we get silence as a response.  That's really insulting, and people interested in tradeskills seem to be getting fed up not being heard which is probably why this topic is popping up in general discussion.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Well, what miffs me is that these things are supposidly tested before going live.<P>Take our Tinkering Armor(Watchmens Armor) when it first came with Velious.  <P>Woohoo!  Deluxe Toolbox!  New things we can make!  We made the eyepatch.  But, wait...uh...the armor takes 9 to 10 spaces?<P>The Deluxe Toolbox only has 8, and the Ak'Anon forge isn't for tinkering.<P>So was it tested in the first place?<P>Then and again, my second little irk about trade skills(ok, Tinkering mostly, but this is a race specific trade skill).  All dropped components for the Watchmens Armor come from one zone.<P>One zone!<P>And what zone is that?<P>Wakening Lands!  Off of Tar Goo's and mobs that if we kill, we can pretty much say "Aidios" to our Tunare faction.  <P>(Theres a big thread on the Tradeskills board on this, check it)<P><BR>I stopped playing EQ for the levels in November.  It's too repetitive, reminding me of the Diablo Syndrome<BR>1)Kill<BR>2)Loot<BR>3)Heal<BR>4)Repeat until death/boredom/level<P>So, thats why I refocused on my Tradeskills.<BR>So far, I'm now:<BR>115 Brewing<BR>174 Smithing<BR>65 Tailoring<BR>59 Baking<BR>98 Tinkering<BR>43 Jewelcraft<BR>165 Fletching<P>It's fun and all, repetitive, but fun...for a while.  <BR>And you Jewelcrafters and Smiths can argue, but Tinkering is by far the most expensive.  Surge suddenly from a 200 plat per attempt that trivials at 148 if I last remember, to an almost 1k attempt that we dont' even know IF it trivials at 200.<BR>And even then, it's hard for us to sell our wares.<P><BR>Oh well, hopefully they'll add something to respark my interest before the next gen of games come out =T</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Dunno what to say here...Trade skills in general are not something that VI takes seriously. Their QA on this is pathetic, and Yak, well, I heard he was liked at one point, but to be honest, he seems to be quite a disaster. The fixes that are needed are so insignificant in degree of work, and so significant with regards to impact that its just amazing how uninterested the trade skills team is. I mean, they *have* to be bored by it. <P>VI, please put employees who care about tradeskills *working* in tradeskills.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Deluxe toolbox now has ten spaces.  (I carry three around.)  The rest of it, though... /sigh  If it's going to go live, PLEASE make sure it works.  People like Drak and Niami Denmother spend untold hours and platinum on tradeskills, and nothing is as frustrating to open a recipe book in-game and find out the formula is wrong.  It can take thousands of plat to find out what the real formula is.<P>Except for Fletching and Research, every tradeskill in the game is a labour of love.  Monks can live without cured silk.  The only "required" smithing items are ones for quests.  Same with brewing.  No one *needs* baking.  Tinkering is a big hole of money, unless you plan on doing the Warrior Epic (which I'm not).  And Alchemy is prohibitively expensive for most Shamans.  Jewelcraft canb e handy, but it's hard to make a profit on old servers, and the Velium stuff isn't worth the cost.  Pottery is the only tradeskill that's reasonable to learn since other tradeskills (smithing, poison) need it, and since you won't have to spend thousands of plat or get CTS to master it.<P>I love trade skills.  I'm a self-confessed trade skill freak.  I'm a master in everything generally available trade skill, and I have no less than three master fletchers.  I'm sure that I'm going to have more masters in my collection of characters, and at least one or two "grand masters."<P>But if you're gonna put it in the game, make sure it works.  We work hard at the skills because we enjoy them, and having mistakes like that is NOT condusive.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Generally, some trade skills don't get profitable until you get upwards of 160 skill.<P>Others are just not profitable.<P>Like Tinkering.<P>Baking is there too, but not as expensive.<P>The Deluxe Toolbox has 10 spaces now, yes, but aren't things supposed to be tested BEFORE going live?  Oh well, guess it all can't be tested, heheh.<P>But, still.  I myself am a tradeskill nut.  I did them on UO, I do/did them in EQ, and I'm still doing them in AC.  I loved it when they added the Watchmens Armor.<P>But them it was like a slap in the face when we found out how we had to get it.  Wakening Lands?  Killing mobs that kill our Tunare faction?<BR>Heck, even asking other players to save their drops is like hiring assassins to take them out.<P>They need someone else to help Yak with the tradeskills stuff.

</FONT><HR>You know what truely bothers me about tradeskills, is not the idea that many of them arent profitable or arent useful (baking).  What truely bothers me is how can things make it to the live server and not work properly.  I mean how hard is it to test these reciepes on the test server.  It should take 1 or 2 people, with the reciepes in hand, only a day or so to test every trade skill reciepe in the game.<BR>  My only conclusion is that either they dont care about the skills or that what ever server they use for in house testing is not using the same codes that the live servers use.  Might even explain why they are unable to duplicate many of our complaints in house.<BR>  Anyway sorry if I came off as to gruff.  Please Absor, have someone take a look at these things and get them fixed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>It would have been better possibly for Verant to have started with Tradeskills and built the rest of the game around them.  This way, they would be an inherent part of life on Norrath.  Instead, they appear to be an afterthough, and the items created are largely superfluous to general gameplay.  <P>Learning a tradeskill or buying from a tradesperson in no way relates to character advancement.  The exception to this is some of the quests that require tradeskill items. Shaman quest and banded comes to mind...there are others but in the grand scheme of things they don't keep a character from advancing or slow it down much.<P>And since the trades are not needed, they are often ignored by the general populace.  And those that partake in the trades find themselves out leveled by their comrades because to be a tradesman means to stop advancement.  In addition to the time (and money) spent creating the trade items, there is also the time spent selling your wares.  This can be more that the actual creation time.  <P>Another problem is that many of the trade items are not in demand by the player base.  Why would someone want to buy any baked goods when muffins are 6 copper.  Why would anyone want to buy forged weapons when fine steel can be gotten relatively cheaply. And in the case of forged shurikens, for instance, that are 10 times the cost of normal shurikens, and only gain you 5 range and 1 delay, they are not worth the effort to make. <P>My question is, who makes bronze weapons and armor, plate armor (not fine steel plate), leather armor, rawhide armor, Fine Steel Weapons, normal weapons, Bags, Backpacks, Quivers, Muffins, etc., etc., blah, blah, ad nauseam...  If recipes needed to be added, why didn't they just make them for items that were already in the game, instead of coming up with a whole new set of items?  Somebody had to make this stuff, so why is it that the methods for making them are non-existant?<P>It'd be nice to be able to open up a shop that you could stock with goods and have other players come to.  It would work like any other Merchant when you are not online and have the ability to be interactive with customers when you are online (bartering haggling and such).  Maybe get rid of the merchants (for the most part) altogether.  Sure on a new server the place would be pretty sparse with only a smattering of NPC merchants around for the essentials.  But as time went on, these PC merchant shops would have the best stuff to sell.  <P>The above idea, of course, would only be viable if they had built the game around the trades instead of the other way around.  <P>There's much more that could be done.  It's too bad that it wasn't.  I'm not sure the trades can be fixed up this late in the game (no pun intended).  The task would be daunting at best, and impossible without a total rewrite at worst.  <P>Unfortunately the trades are what they are, and nothing else, and I doubt they will ever be what they could have.  Maybe in the next iteration, perhaps.<P>Forgive my rambling, I could talk for pages.<P>Rocco Scarpaci<BR>Cazic Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Guys, tradeskills are only in EQ cos the UO converts who came to play EQ in the first place wanted them. They are a pale comparison of their UO counterparts...for all the flaws of Ultima Online, tradeskills make sense and you can make mucho dough out of them...more than you can from killing monsters...<BR>Verant should really separate tradeskills form experience levels...the game system demands you sink all your spare time into camping/hunting/travelling in EQ...so when can you devote money/time to a system that is a) tied to your current experience level.<BR>b) is not profitable for the most part.<BR>c) some tradeskills tied too closely to certain racial/class abilities. e.g try brewing without a foraging skill, try jewellry without enchanting ability. Not impossible but damn hard.<BR>d) Consequences that don't make sense. How the hell can you lose a cake tin if you fail to make a cake or bread? Verant' probable answer? Oh, the nuclear force of Solusek Ro cursed your attempt or some other nonsense. I've made cakes and bread in real life...never lost a damn tin yet.<P>Tradeskills in EQ are ridiculous as they stand...either abolish them altogether, or separate them from levelling/hunting and make them worthwhile and interesting.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I personally have tried every viable sketch (I didn't try the cookie or vial patterns, but did use both large bowl sketches), with all three sizes of clay, with and without an onyx during the pottery wheel stage (I suspect the onyx is actually placed during the kiln stage, for what it's worth).  I have also tried the Large Bowl Sketch with something called Wet Clay.  I have personally talked to several of the vedors selling pottery items to see if they give info, using illusion & alliance spells to get to amiable and sometimes kindly/warmly, with no success.  It is not listed in the book, and there is only the one book known to exist.

WARNING!  OTHER GAMES ARE APPROACHING!"<P>1&gt; Anarchy Online will have an actual merchant class.  Characters will be able to gain expeience from performing trade skills.  That said, there's been very little info as to how effective crafted items are, and without items desired by players you *don't* have viable trade skills [you might have a money cheat, but not viable trade skills].<P>2&gt; Dark Ages of Camolot claims that their trade skills will be viable enough that players who don't want to go into the field and hunt other players will be able to do so.  I remain skeptical, especially given some very large gaps in what they're telling us.<P>3&gt; UO2 will be made by OSI.  As a former UO player, who still says the trade skills are the only thing I miss about UO, that translates best as "K TNX BY!".<P>4&gt; Shadowbane also claims their trade skills will be beneficial and highly desirable; one claim made was that the grief players will be actively seeking trade skills wonks to make their phat loot.  On the other hand, given their "I don't play games to bake bread..." crack and history of pandering to grief players, insert "K TNX BY!" crack here.<P>5&gt; Dawn... will have babies (which are actually low-leveled players, mind) being launched by catapult at other players.  And will have network code that will allow your signal to get to the server before it leaves your computer.  Word is the people making the game are former EQ quality control personnel (kidding).

</FONT><HR>Xezol:<P>Why is chain so much if it isn't better than banded?  Having never bothered to attempt chain since the "Chain Recipies are out there, I'm surprised no one has found them yet..." fiasco I honestly don't even know the recipe.  I have a guess why it's so much, though.  What do the components cost.  If they are anywhere approaching 20 plat an attempt, that's why chain is so expensive.  You (or someone who knows the cost) will have to let me know if I'm off base because, as I said, I honestly don't know.<P>And if it costs any more, even a plat more, per attempt than banded, then why isn't it better than banded.  That's the crux. <P>And as far as low banded prices go.  The reason it's so cheap is there is ton of it around and it never wears out.  The more there is of something the less it's gonna cost.  <P>I'd like to sell Fine Steel for 500 a Breast Plate cause it's about 90 plat an attempt and the ore is a pain to process into sheets (seeing as how there's only two places in the world I can get it).  I tried selling fine steel for three times cost to make when it first came out and got so many rude comments I just quit making it.<P>Like I said before, I don't see any way out of the Trades Quagmire.<P>Rocco Scarpaci.<BR>Cazic Thule.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There are 3 useful tradeskills(not counting class/race specific):<P>Jewelcraft- skill most in demand(offset by the outrageous cost)<P>Fletching- will not make you money but will save you money in the long run(if you use a bow)<P>Tailoring- Only tradeskill you have a chance of making a decent profit at(due to 10 slot backpacks-and nothing else)<P>Then you have the rest:<P>Smithing- If you wanna throw away your money, this is almost as good as jewelcraft with alot less return<P>Baking- absolute waste of time<P>Pottery- maybe if you were a rogue, and wanted to goof off with those poisons that'll be useless by the time you can make them...<P>Brewing- Well ok, so maybe there are 4 useful tradeskills  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't know how the social life of EQ game designers is in Real Life. But it makes you wonder if they design a game in which the only functioning social interaction is beating something up together.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Joke aside, I played UO before EQ and in the direct comparison the EQ trade skills are a bad joke. In UO a significant amount of players are skilled craftsmen. And in UO being a Grandmaster Smith means that you are not very good at fighting or casting spells. But obviously a lot of players prefer this peaceful style of play.<P>Sorry, Verant, but beating up something together is NOT the only form of social interaction. The interaction between the customers, players looking for equipment, and the tradesmen, leads to very ALIVE cities, bustling with something close to medieval city atmosphere.<P>In EQ tradeskills are useless because most of the items you can produce are useless. Why should somebody go out and smith a skewer when nobody in this game NEEDS a skewer? Not the players and not even the NPCs, which just buy it for an amount lower than what you paid for the mold and the metal. Why should somebody learn baking and spend lots of money on producing food items that are in no way superior to cheap muffins you can buy from a NPC? Yes, some people do it because they are bored and idle and rich.<P>As a newbie in UO you have the same problems as a newbie in EQ. No money or equipment to speak of and difficulties to kill even a small spider. So in UO you have the choice of either killing small things and making money from the loot, OR first following a tradeskill, earning some money with that, and buying a rusty sword from the profits. Pity the newbie who tries that in EQ.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
