</FONT><HR>Here are the advantages:<P>Best damage in the game: The combo of Mage pet and DD's means no one (not even a wiz) can bring more single target damage to a fight. Especially when you start getting damage shields. Wizards have better area of effect spells, so can bring more damage to multiple creatures. This is a moot point in all groups with an Enchanter.<P>Best utility spells: Waterstones (Enduring Breath), Heatstones (Infravision), Coldstone (Ultravision), and Ring of Flight (Levitate) all come in the form of items. This means you can pre-cast these spells, mem something else, and hand them out when needed. If I give a warrior six waterstones he can now cast Enduring Breath on himself six times. Give a Barbarian a Coldstone and he/she has it until log out. <P>The bad news:<P>If you want to be on every groups must have list be a Shamman, Cleric, or Enchanter. These three classes are on every groups must have list.<P>Verant won't fix the the mages most vile bug: I am refering to the fact that if you go LD (link dead) all summoned items in your posession disapear. This includes summoned bags and all items within. My understanding is they have even ruled out extending the time it takes for items to disappear after LD. <P>Currently my only character is a level 40 Mage and I love it. A combo of Mage and Druid or Mage and Necro is deadly. I only consider another class when I LD.<P>If you are on Luclin send Maestron a /tell and I will expand on this if you want.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hi hi,<BR>Be not be sad mages are awesome. The above posts <BR>have much truth in them. I would argue that at low<BR>lvls people are not as obsessed about cleric, ench<BR>and shamans as they are at highers lvls.<P>It must also be said that I have never had a<BR>problem getting groups when ever I want. A mages<BR>pet can do more damage than a warrior and the <BR>nukes are not terribly far behind a wiz add in<BR>damage shields and we are totally useful in <BR>groups.<P>As to soloing, I am amazed at the we get no exp<BR>soloing statement. I had to switch to my mage from<BR>bard due to wrist problems, so I had to solo for a<BR>bit did 22-32 in less than 80 hours solo. <BR>No twinking, no power lvled by hi lvl people just<BR>straight solo.<BR>Hell my kill rate as a mage was 3 times that of a<BR>ranger who was 4 lvls above me on the same mobs!<BR>Did lvl 30 in 1 day. Mages solo awesomely. I am<BR>sorry but if you die as a mage when soloing unless<BR>you got trained or pulled more than one mob then you where silly. There really is no excuse to<BR>die. You've got a pet, whatch its health, if its<BR>going down fast either chain a pet or gate.<P>Mages rock, teams love us, soloing is easy.<P>Arios lvl 53 Mage</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have a 46 druid and I like grouping with mages.  Paired up we can hate kite.  I snare, mage malaises and sends pet with no taunt, I immolate and cast a wind spell now and then for taunt.  Mob chases me across zone while pet destroys it. Fight over, full health 4 bubs of mana. Hit track button and start again.<P>2 great indoor dungeons for mages-- Solb and kedge keep.  Malaise drops fire resist so I can actually nuke in Solb.  In kedge mages are great, pets don't have problems swimming and staying on the mob like the tanks.  Waterstones are great in there too.  Sure I have enduring breath, but try getting it off in the middle of a fight when a mermaid dispels you and the frenzied shark is chewing you to shreds.  Mages are also good at area effect tactics.  While the nukes aren't as damaging as the wizzy's, your earth pet helps keep at least one mob under control, and jababer is great for sweeping up the remains.  If we could only train him to fetch the paper (loot) for us we'd be set.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><P>Two replies here:<P>1. To Druid poster - The only place a Druid/Mage pair will work is outdoors.  SolB is a deadly place, Kledge keep is also deadly.  Both require well balanced teams.  Druids have a better chance of living in both dungeons.<P>2.  Wizards v Mage - No contest here.  Wizards Have best DDs and Teleports.  Required in most groups and more effective in groups because of root and awsome dds.  In the PvP world at high levels Wizards will more often then not loose in duels against a same level mage.  Even if you root the pet I would be using a water or fire pet.  the casts would buy me time to finish you..even if I needed to melee.<P>On Blue servers Wizards win for group and advancement purposes.<P>On PvP mages have a slight advantage.<P><BR>Rthen Majere<BR>Level 46 Mage<BR>Saryn<BR>Guildleader - Nightwatch of Norrath<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

We are highly useful in planes and large raids. With COH you have a skill that is hard to find. We have the best damage shields. I have said this on many occasions, the mage is versitile.

</FONT><HR>Staying as a mage comes down to one important thing. Do you plan on staying in for the long haul to 60th or not?  Magicians are great for damage into the mid 40s, at that point monks, warriors and rogues with good weapons with start to outdamage you and continue to do so all the way to 60th and at the mid 50s they will outdamage you by a good margin. With the damage shields you might be able to bring more damage to the group than a warrior. The main problem comes down to areas where pets dont work you are the most pathetic damage dealer in the game.<P>Magicians place in "the vison" seems to be the slayer of greenies, as it is the only thing we do better than anyone else(and is also target of endless complanits from melee classes about our pets being "too powerful").  I would like to point out that prekunark we were the highest damage dealing class in the game and were told that everything was balanced... now melees outdamage us, yet everything is still balanced?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><P>I Made the post 50 levels last week and while I agree that Mages are kinda are worthless without a pet I do believe that with a pet we can be more effective then a melee class even on high level raids.<P>My level 51 earth pet hits for 58 and sometimes quads for it.  I hear the level 52 fire pet is crap at melee but casts level 29 wiz spells with no mana concerns and can do upwards of 300 damage per round.  I have also heard that the level 53 air pet quads for 56 and avoids hit like a monk.<P>Mages seem to have a place, but knowing what human nature is since mages don't give to the group the same way I doubt what they offer will be accepted.<P>I will still be a mage even though it means hardship for finding groups because I have finally decided we are damn good.<P>Its sad that I am only feeling this way post 50 and after taking on some decent mobs like:<BR>1.  Lava Duct Crawlers<BR>2.  Spirocs<BR>3.  Sgs (I can kill them until I am tired)<P>This to name only a few.  I wish mages had the power I precieve they do post 50 pre 50.<P><BR>Rthen Majere<BR>Level 51 Elementalist</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000458-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000458-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000458&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000458&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
