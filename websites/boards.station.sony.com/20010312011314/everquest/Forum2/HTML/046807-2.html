</FONT><HR>Kinasiel:  A minor inconvenience is not enough to cause a major inconvenience by closing the servers again for 10 hours, especially when there are other fixes needed in the near future (snare/root, group exp, dungeon retools, tradeskill fixes).  Should there be a new 10-hour patch immediately upon each of those things being fixed?  Or should they get all the fixes together at once and do a single patch?  This does not cripple your class, only makes you use different strategies.  There is no need for a patch now, when another is due in two days.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Phelan42:  Fine the new patch is due in two days.  Sorry, but it's not good enough for me.  I pay my money just like everyone else does to play this game and enjoy the time I spend with the people I know within it.  Am I asking for a reimbursal?  Hardly, what I *am* saying is that it is a slap in the face to be told "Honestly?  Admit to yourselves and to me it's nothing more than an inconvience."  Seriously Phelan, I've seen you bashing people in the bard threads created today, and I've also seen you bashing VI in those threads as well where the majority of what I've read from others has been constructive.  Point is - do I want everyone to suffer because I am?  No, what I want is to hear, "Doh, we goofed, it's fixed and we'll bring the servers down tonight at 3am PST (non-peak time) and re-patch for 3 hours."  Am I going to hear that?  Unfortunately, no.  Asking bards to admit to themselves that this is merely nothing more than an inconvience and to deal with it until Friday is like rubbing salt in the wound.  <P>I'm not looking to start anything here Phelan, I don't want this turning into some flame fest where insults are tossed back and forth.  If you have a bard, and and love the game ... it would hurt you too.  <P>Do unto others ... as you'd have them do unto you.<P>Kaimana Adaro<BR>33rd Bard<BR>MithMarr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>No Lyrical, you are acting childish because you keep CREATING new threads, and when someone rational aside from me (Brewhaus) makes a reasonable suggestion, you take it to silly extremes that are not what was suggested.<P>Kinasiel:  I doubt the patch would only be 3 hours.  Fixes to the code like this, take a lot longer to implement than that.  As there are other fixes due, and another patch already in preparation, it simply doesn't appear reasonable to force another on this minor inconvenience.<P>I've been plenty constructive.  Verant ought to listen to the folks on Test, even when it looks like another boy-crying-wolf scenario.  Starting dozens of threads on the same subject, is counter-productive and will only turn the rest of the players against ya.  Both of those comments are constructive, and are 90% of what I have been posting.  The other 10% was individual criticism of posters acting childishly or defending myself.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I doubt I will be now. Once again thank you for screwing the game over and inconveniencing your customers. I hope Verant takes EQ's HUGE lack of Customer Service into consideration when they make Star Wars Online.

</FONT><HR>Alan,<P>  Bard song with drum means out running a Sarnak that has cast some speed buff on it's self. Without a drum, it means a Dead Bard. If you played in Burning Woods at all, you know that those Sarnaks out run SoW.. <P>  I don't play a Bard, but that is instant death to a Bard if a Sarnak attacks them that has cast a speed increase buff on themselves. How can that little detail be ignored. it means the Bard will die. They can't out run it, nor root it, and if they charm it what than? Recast Selo's charm breaks. Sarnak beats them to a pulp. <P>  So it is not a big deal, it is a HUGH one. <P>  Remember Risk vs. Reward. Without the DRUM speed boost there is so much more tremendous risk than ever before and with no Reward at al to counter ballance it.<P>Calebe<BR>Level 56 Magician<BR>E'CI Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
