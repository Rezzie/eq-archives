</FONT><HR>There are many weak humans out there that join the mutants out of fear of the evils, fearing that without their help we will fall to the evils.  I find it sad that they don't believe in themselves and have conceded defeat.  This kind of thought is what drives many to become evil, as the weak always wish to join a team they believe is already winning.<P>To them I say make the mutants fear us more then the evils and they will be more likely to attack the evils, then invading our lands and taking up our resources.  If the mutants are required to fight the evils, it keeps them both at bay while we grow in strengh and numbers.  With succesful raids of the mutants, our fame will spread and our numbers will grow.  Mutants and evils will spawn less and Qeynos will be crowded with new humans wishing to join in our battles.<P>Wake up humans!  Realize, the mutants are only waiting their turn at us.  They attack humans all over Antonica while we turn the other way, because we believe they are only attacking the "evil humans" like Orsagen in High Keep or corrupt guards in West Karanas, along with raiders and bandits.  They are developing a taste for attacking humans and we must stop them before it is too late.  We can police our own lands!  If Orsagen attacks a human, WE will deal with him, if bandits harass our residents, we will bring them to justice.<P>Let us remove the hordes of mutants in High Hold keep as well as other human lands.  Make them fear us and seek experience and loot in evil lands.  If the mutants are removed from high hold keep they will be forced to go to South Karanas or Lake Rathe and fight the evils for resources.  Leaving our lands to the humans and forcing them to fight our enemy, weakening both, while we grow strong.<P>If you believe as I do, and wish to fight with honor and dignity, then answer the call to arms and apply for membership with Global Menace at http://www.angelfire.com/in3/GlobalMenace  ,hurry before it is too late.  <P>Ldare D'fin<BR>Proud Officer of Global Menace<BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I am sorry for your plight in that you are the blandest race on Norrath.  It is your very mediocrity that sets you apart in this world.  All of us so called "mutants" will be happy to see you band together, for that is the only way we will ever see anything that strikes of humans rising above the morass of normality that you call your lives.

</FONT><HR>LOL, nimbletoe, we have members almost level 40, so i highly doubt you can hit them, let alone defeat them.  We don't level fast as we spend most of our time killing mutants, then pve, shocking i know, but this is a pvp team server.<P>I would be happy to fight you at anytime.  As for killing Dark Elves, I attack any non human team within pvp range I can.  I regurlaly attack in Lake Rathe and I must say at least the evils we kill usually don't whine.  They loot and scoot with honor, unlike the other non human races.  If you were to go to the Shanks web page, you would find the screenshots of us holding the newbie log in Nektulos from all defenders.  (Our low levels do raids to =) )<P>At least gnomes do play the 4 team concept alot, I wish more would.  I remember seeing a group of gnome marauders in South Karanas attacking and defeating all comers, evils, humans, and elfs.  That was a great battle. I couldn't cast on them as they were to high so i was able to watch the battles.<P>I respect any guild or player that plays the 4 team concept, the way Verant set it up on Vallon.  It is a very difficult lifestyle in Norrath, but an honorable one.  You need to have a thick skin as many will curse you, shun you, and repeatedly lie and /petition you.  Those are just the so called "honorable ones".  The less "Honorable" will train you, corpse camp you, bind rush and get their Immortals to kill steal from you.  Regardless of the mutants character, you need to know that every mutant in Norrath will actively seek your destruction.  Traitorous human team members will even aid the mutants seeking your destruction. I have seen humans healing and buffing Dark elves! (shudders)<BR>It is a very hard road we follow.  Many have joined, only to leave after but a day or two of service.  If you believe you have what it takes to survive in this Hostile Environement, apply for membership.<P>On a lighter note, i entered High Keep this morning and was able to clear it of all the mutants!  Woohoo!  Only human team members remained.  I hope to repeat it again this evening, so if you wish to battle, that's where I'll be.<P>*Remember friends, don't let friends Crossteam!<BR>*Have you killed a gnome today?<BR>*Be considerate,loot and scoot!<BR>*A well balanced meal consists of 1 shorty, 1 elfy and 1 evil.  Don't forget to remove the lips on the elfy or shorty or the whining will hurt your ears.<P>Ldare D'fin<BR>Proud Officer of Global Menace<BR>www.angelfire.com/in3/GlobalMenace<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Having done nothing to them, she was surprised to be attacked... but a halfling druid is a tough one to catch, and I easily eluded their attack. <P>Hate me if you will, but I reserve my anger for the powers of darkness, such as the troll shadow knight Kazkaz who I helped drive from Qeynos Hills.

</FONT><HR>Hello all.<P>Let me say first that I'll accept your invitation to fight, mage. I am a member of Global Menace, and would love to fight you. You say you can beat me, I doubt it.<P>Global Menace IS, HANDS DOWN, the most hated/hunted/taunted guild on Vallon Zek, barring maybe the Prophets. And that's the way we expected it. You see, we do not conform to their so called "Light vs Dark" belief. And why should we? So we'll have a safe place to hunt in our upper levels? So we'll have friends everywhere we go? Let me tell you this, friends, and enemies alike, friends will betray you, but an enemy will not. Think about it. We stand up for our belief that it was intended a 4 teams server, that's what we signed up for, and that's what we're doing.<BR>For all that like to cry, RACIST! KKK! (And this just amuses the hell outta me.) I say, are you freggen high?? How could you compare a GAME CONCEPT to a real life ideaology like that? I can see for those that have never experienced the true meaning of the word hatred (As seen by the actions of the real life KKK, or Nazis) that might make that equasion, but that just shows your ignorance, and naievety (sp?). You signed up for a 4 team server, but you chose to play it LvD mostly for the sake that most are too weak to think they can stand as a team if they play it 4 teams. (And this is evident by all the "LIGHT" race members always talking about "The dark team is overpowered, and if we do not unite, they'll easily take over the lands") Bah, you're just weak.<BR>KKK, Nazi, Racist.. Hahaha. Before you throw these words around, think. They are truely derived from hatred in it's purest form, and DO CAUSE RL Anxiety. You don't think so? Ask a black man if he gets pissed just thinking about the KKK, or a Jew if they get mad at what the Nazis did to them, or their family in Germany. And as for Racist, those that use this word in the game are fools. This is a game, and is not intended to depict RL feelings of hatred, but instead to depict Verients attempt to make a reasonable PvP server. FACT is that EQ was NOT designed for PvP, so, Rallos was created, but sorely lacked in anything other than "EVERYONE KILLING EVERYONE ELSE", thus Varient decided to try something... PvP Teams. You got it.. No intention to have idiots bring in RL hate and BS, but merely an easy way to see who your enemies were, and who was your "ally". Nothing more, nothing less. (And folks, PLEASE don't show your ignorance of this little bit of EQ history by trying to debate that.) So, if Racism, and of the such is brought into it, then it's the fools that bring it up, that bring it into the game.<BR>Now, Ldare, I am suprised to see a recruiting message here, but glad to see it. Thanks, and keep up the good work.<BR>Now, let me introduce myself, for those that have not figured it out.<P>I am Norlalos Iebaine, Leader of Global Menace.<BR>Thank you for your time.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>There is an in-game rp'ed racism on this server, but that is technically what this server is about.  Just like having Ldare call all the races except human "mutants" is a showing of the type of racism involved here.  I'm not saying this is a bad thing, when it is rp'ed out.

After all, without PKers, i wouldnt have a target  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> . Really though, the simple fact we are on a PK server lets me RP a hell of a lot more than...some of the others. No, i bet in RL your perfectly normal individuals...but thats not the point.<P>Notice I didnt say YOU were being racist, but your characters were. Like it or not, your characters are the everquest version of the KKK, Nazi's, etc.<P>"They are truely derived from hatred in it's purest form, and DO CAUSE RL Anxiety. You don't think so? Ask a black man if he gets pissed just thinking about the KKK, or a Jew if they get mad at what the Nazis did to them, or their family in Germany."<P>Alright. I said, once again, you were the Everquest version (Vallon Zek version would have been better though). They cause RL anxiety because they're the RL version. You cause RP anxiety to gnomes, elves, and the like, because your the RP version. You think a family of Dwarves making their living in Qeynos wouldn't feel pissed if you asked them what the Global Menace has done to them and their families? Wouldnt they be mad just thinking about it?<P>"And as for Racist, those that use this word in the game are fools. This is a game, and is not intended to depict RL feelings of hatred, but instead to depict Verients (er, spelling mistake) attempt to make a reasonable PvP server."<P>Its a word. Your guild fits the definition very well. If you say it doesnt, grab a dictionary and define it for me. Anyways, what you said is like saying those who use the word 'ignorant' in game are fools. Ignorant is another word to describe you sometimes..but anyways, i promised myself not to be hostile. Do not be hostile to the evil PKers, or they will not like you and then maybe will stop trying to hurt you so you cant hurt them. Yes, it is a game. No, its not meant to depict RL feelings of hate. But if your RP, you should feel RP feelings of hate. Thats all I meant by the post. I was simply letting them know more about your guild.<P>Thanks for your time, and I'd better let you go back to hunting me down now :razz:<P>Evantine Essidel<BR>High Elf Wizard of Marr<BR>Proud X-Teamer for over 20 Levels</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Greetings,<P>To clear things up a bit.  Global Menace is not a guild of hate.  We are a guild of love.  We love humankind so much so, that we take the killing of our kind very seriously.  As we do the stealing of our resources by those of non human descent.  We also take pride in our lands and our people and dislike defeatest, talk by those that say we would fall before the might of the evil beings in this land if we do not ally ourselves with them.<P>FACT:  Our lands are being invaded by elves, gnomes, dwarfs, halflings, and yes even dark elves and trolls and such evil beings as have ever been seen in Norrath.<P>They are all guilty of killing humans, whether the humans they kill be raiders, bandits, corrupt guards or heretics.  They try to take the hunting lands of honorable humans trying to feed their families.  Many a time, I have come to a hunting ground, only to see an elf or other miscreant there.  When I ask them to leave so I can hunt and provide for my family, they refuse and proceed to be rude and vulgar.  I ask again and then they look at me threateningly and have even been known to attack me.  After soo many of these encounters, I have learned to just force them from our lands, as I tire of the 2 previous steps.<P>Do I hate these creatures? NO.  I pity them.  If their lands were as well cared for and prosperous as ours, perhaps they would not come from so far, to try and take what is ours.  Regardless of how much I pity them, I love my homeland and our peoples more.  I realize that the long term effects of their repeated invasion into our lands is more then our resources and peoples can handle.  So that we may stay strong, and Antonica prosperous and beautiful, they must be purged.<P>Remember one thing, by purging them from our lands we send them to the Gods they worship and Adore.  So in then end, one might even say, "Are we not doing them a favor by killing them?"  <P>Come join us and help humankind be what it can be.  Together we can defeat the Evils and protect our lands from the miscreants, who wish to destroy our resources and keep our families from providing for themselves.  The time is now, before we are overrun.  Highhold is already invested with miscreants, whom allowed the once beautiful Kithicor Forest to fall to evil during the night.  Soon it will not be safe even during the day!  Just yesterday Cross Treewind was killed and our waters poisoned in surefall!  We shall avenge this desecration of our lands this weekend!  <P><BR>Ldare D'fin<BR>Proud Officer of Global Menace<P>www.angelfire.com/in3/GlobalMenace</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Global Menace,<P>It comes down to this: you envy Us, the Elder Races, for all our glory and for all we have achieved. We have achived far more then your pitiful excuse of a warband, more then the entire race of humans.<P>Pfft Global Meance.....silly young ones.<P>You're a Menace not only to the races of Faydwer, and our allies on Antonica, but also to your own race. <P>I quote from lDareDfin, <BR>"This kind of thought is what drives many to become evil, as the weak always wish to join a team they believe is already winning".<P>Hear my call, young ones of the human race, do NOT take up arms and follow the tide of darkness. Do not join global Meance for they are not winning. Doing so will surely lead to your own death.<BR>Seek does that belive in the Light! And destroy the darkness!<P>Global Menace,<BR>You will slowly wither away like a rotten tree in the garden of Innoruuk's followers.<P><BR>Jezekiell, Ranger of Tunare,<BR>Officer of Army of Faydwer.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bravo to the non-Xteaming GM guild.  This is what this server is all about.  Evils (Orange) for the most part has always stood alone.  <BR>Aside from the small amount of evils that xteam (and it is a SMALL amount compaired to the whole), the Humans (blue), Shorts (purple), and the Elves (yellow) have always Xteamed their little hearts out.  Continue to build your guild and I will enjoy to battle your blue only guild to my orange only group (hehe.. not in a guild at the moment).  I tire of of having to battle three different teams at once.  <BR>Infact, I joined a raid to KC last night.  You want to talk about a guild, Dark Storm is the one to use as your model.  They were three groups acting as one while they exterminated the three teams grouping in KC.  There was THREE groups in there exp fighting.  Needless to say, they were of all the different light teams.  All of those teams fought together against the one orange team.  The battle lasted 2 minutes.  No orange died.  It goes to show, the one team guild works.  <BR>Continue to build. You are capturing the essense of the PvP Teams sever.  Evils kill anything that isn't on their team.  Why should the others be any different?<BR>Xteaming goes way beyond evils grouping with lights.. Xteaming is just what it is.  The grouping of multiple teams together.  I hate to preach segregation, but that is the design of this particular world.<BR>You are spending your money, so you play as you see fit.  This is ONLY my opinion and I just hope that some people might agree with atleast part of it.  <BR>Thank you and enjoy the show.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>-Camarr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Again we are sending the word out to find others that will take up arms against the ones that threaten our lands and our security for our families.. <P>If you are a member of a human team race, and are not illusioned by the mutant lies of peace and friendship, then you are the one we're looking for.<P>For far too long, the mutant plague in the lands has been seeking to destroy our race and been plotting against our very existance. <P>Don't be bullied by the "light" races, stand up for your beliefs and help to ensure the prosperity of your race! Let the weak humans goto their elven whores, and let their bloodlines cease to exist. <P>The guild Global Menace is recruiting only those that have the courage, stamina, strength, and heart fo defend the lands from our true enemies. If you feel this calling as strongly as others have, then contact our guild members. They will direct you from there.<P>Norlalos Iebaine,<BR>Officer, Global Menace<BR>Vallon Zek.<BR>www.angelfire.com/in3/GlobalMenace<P>"Have you killed a peck today?"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Bravo Global Menace !<P>Tis been too long since I've crossed paths with the likes of thee & yearn to do so again. Restarted on Vallon two nites ago and already my High-elf cleric, of the 4th rank, seeks to join the battles.  <P>Alas, it seems the elven attitude is still one of "peace & harmony". BAH! What has this earned our race but contempt and continual jests and humiliation from the other races? We are seen as weak & so we should be. Grouping & overall cooperation is nearly extinct in the lands of Greater Faydware. The elven guilds I've inquired about preach "Peace not War". By Tunare they have been struck simple-minded!<P>Lead me to a true Elven guild & you will see my abilities displayed up the fields of battle.<P>   Harma of Felwithe<BR>   Cleric of Tunare<BR>  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
