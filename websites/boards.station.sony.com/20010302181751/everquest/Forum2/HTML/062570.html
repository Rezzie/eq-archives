</FONT><HR>(warning for the humor impaired, the request for backstab is a joke, the stuff about taunt, isnt)<P>Well, this has been going on for a while now, but what the hell.  I am officially requesting warriors get backstab.  That is all i really see anymore, the back of the mobs.  Cuz my rogue, monk, Cleric, Druid, Shaman, Enc are all doing the tanking.  Everyone but me really.  Sure, sometimes i hit mr taunt button, the mob turns around briefly, snarls meanly at me, then continues to chew on my monk or rogue.<P>It is pretty sad, that at the end of the fight, im the only person in the group, that DOESNT need to be healed.<P>Something needs to be done about warrior taunt.  I am definitely not poorly equipped, esp in the weapon department (Jade Mace/Lam, decent combo, working on my epics, and havent had much luck in winning any velious weapons), but, i simply cant out taunt alot of people.  Palys, heh, if they are chain stunnin, no way, SK's stack a few of those DoTs, again, no way.  Warriors have no spells besides weapon procs to help them out really.  What good do all those HP do us, if we cant keep the mobs attention.<P>Personally, i feel that palys and SK need to be able to taunt as well... but something needs to be done to help me, as a warrior taunt.  Getting my epic shouldnt be a requirement for me to be able to taunt.<P>I personally feel, i should be able to keep mobs on me quite a bit (and at least equal to a paly stunning and SK's casting their spells, so if i am in the same group with a paly and sk, we share the aggro equally) but at the moment, the only time im keeping the mobs on me is when i pull... then, it is difficult after combat starts.<P>I would like to have this taunt matter looked into.<P>Maybe having the taunt button being hit, puts a warrior more the just hate_number +1?  Other suggestions would be nice as well.<P>Thank You<P>Petr Elvenblade<BR>Myrmidon, 56<BR>Kel'Daoine<BR>Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well, you probably CAN but it will have a lower skill cap than that of Rogues. Maybe they will design it like tracking in which they will cap the skill at 50 for you warriors (like they did with tracking for the Druids) so that the Rogues don't get mad...but in reality all you warriors will secretly know that the lower cap is in fact better, and everyone will be happy as long as you remain quiet about it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Does the existence of a backstab button force a rogue to backstab?  No.  Does the fact that an sk has mana and dots require it to cast dots? No.<P>If a wizard were to stand up, and chain cast ice comet on every pull, would you complain that you needed a higher taunt skill to protect the wizard?  No.<P>If a rogue gets some gets behind a mob and proceeds to chain backstab it, would you complain that you needed a higher taunt skill to protect the rogue?  Yes.<P>Hmmm, ... how about telling the rogue "don't stab so much".   Tell the sk "easy with the dots", etc.<P>To the rogue:  That backstab doesn't help the party if it causes you to take 700 damage because you have no ac.  Adapt or suffer.<P>To the warrior:  Tell your groupies if they are using their skills to out taunt you, ..lay off the skills some.  Of course, this is probably as hard as telling a wizard to not chain nuke singles just because he can.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

There have been countless times where I'm at full health while my cleric and rogue are dying.... And it used to be if we pulled multiple mobs I could have the others beating on me and was kinda fine with that a little bit... now I'm running into enchanters that do their job well and mez the others  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>I seriously am the only one who gets hit the least and I CAN'T STAND IT! I hit the button every single time it pops up I swear! Yet some SK 5 levels below me STILL gets the taunt...<P>Look Verant. We have a button. Every single class can out taunt us in some way. Our button needs a little bit more work or its going to be totally pointless to play the warriors. I love being a warrior...  And I'm sick and tired of people starting posts saying "If warriors want to tank, be a hybrid!!!" NO it should NOT be that way!! We're not the damage dealers and we don't have a single spell all we have is that button!! So make it useful will ya!?

</FONT><HR>I couldn't agree more.<P>While I like the changes that have been happening with the hybrids, I do think that it's diluting the warrior.  The warrior has always been the class that is ready to "take one for the team" if necessary.  Not to imply that warriors are willing to die, but rather that warriors (at least the good ones) WANT to take the damage.<P>I see a couple possible solutions.  <P>1)  increase the effectiveness of warrior taunt.<P>2)  Give them a new skill, "enrage" which would have a refresh time of around the same as a monk's mend skill and is essentially a massive taunt to all monsters within arms reach.<P>Personally, I favor #2 over #1.  It would seperate the bad warriors from the good ones.  A good one would know when to agro everything on him and when not to.  Bad timing (or a bad healer even) would be deadly.  Good timing would permit the warrior to buy time for a caster or weak melee for the benefit of the group.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Razzan I don't think it's a good idea to tell people not to deal damage.<P>"Why don't you guys pick at it all so I can have the taunt"<P>I play with a Rogue almost every single day... times arise when it comes to I taunt every single second. The Rogue picks away at piercing... this goes on for a while and the rogue sticks one backstab in - BOOM he's got the taunt. He evades... still has the taunt.<P>With the list of your "tell the &lt;class&gt; to &lt;insert skill&gt; less" You should really know that is crazy. Let's put it in to context with some class specific skills/duties<P>Clerics can't heal as much? Puller pulled a lot of guys and comes back with little health... warrior goes to single out every mob and get the taunt... puller is left with less and less health... guess what... the puller's gotta be healed and I'm going to tell him "No because I want the taunt"? What if an add comes along and wastes the poor puller... well now I'm a jerk.<P>Wizard, don't nuke so much. Yes I love him to sit on his butt and pull out a little spell so he doesn't get the taunt. I love it when they don't prove useful to the group.<P>Enchanters don't crowd control!? Bah! you gotta be kidding...<P>See what I'm saying? I don't mind working for my taunt.. or I "wouldn't" mind if It actually worked.<P>Sure if there was some idiot chain casting spells of course he's going to get the taunt and he's probably going to die... that's his own fault. But when my groupmates cast 1 heal,nuke, or throw a backstab it's on them.. and I can't get it off... It is not the deal of the "chain casting" or "chain backstabbing" it just takes 1.... I can't tell you this enough... it just takes 1 spell and 1 backstab and I lose the taunt.<P>That's how it is.<BR>-Dief</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

AoEs have this nasty way of aggroing beyond walls and taunt aggros regardless of faction.

The Rogue is the one who does the most damage to the monster.  He is the one who does the actually killing.  He should not be the tank.  How many times have you heard.  ROGUES ARE NOT TANKS.<P>3. The Cleric is the guy who keeps us all from dying.  He watches the rogues and warriors life bars.  Now adventually he has to heal one of them first.  Much better if he heals warrior.  Cleric is the last person who should tank!<P><BR>But this is what happens now.  Fight starts, after second back stab, rogue has monsters attention.  Rogue tries to evade, warrior tries to tuant.  Well monster loves to munch rogue, and ignore pathetic warrior taunt.  Next cleric has to heal rogue, boom monster on cleric.  Rogue starts frantically back stabing trying to get monster back off cleric and on him.  Warrior keeps trying his useless taunt.  (WARRIORS DON'T YOU FEEL REAL IMPORTANT IN THIS SCENE).  Rogue can not get moster off cleric so he dies.  Monster turns on rogue since he is next on the hate list he dies.  Warrior survives since he has a billion hit points as he runs for the zone.<P>Not a pretty picture.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>SuperMary<P>Yes I did read the entire thread.<P>I say give warriors better taunt because.<P>1. Backstab is not 100%, It can miss, get parried, rip'd, dodged etc.<P>2. After the last patch with the Cleric CH agro 'fix', I've seen 2 rogues BS for 400+ and the mob still beats on the cleric.<P>3. I've seen rogues BS for 400+ and it still beats on the wizard killing him for doing 1 drought of fire, I've talked with alot of high level wizards and most cannot dump their mana bar before getting summoned and killed on big raids.<P>IMHO Warriors Taunt should be soo good that if your 55+ and your taunt is max'd / caped, the mob will turn and devote atlast one attack round to you no matter what.  That way if enuf warriors are all hitting their taunt, they can spread the damage around so that 1 person isnt always getting trashed on for 600+ a hit.  That way clerics dont have to use CH and other healing classes can work on uber raids, As is right now the only real healers on uber raids are Clerics and Paladins ( for the 1 time LOH )  And CH is the only spell that matters, but after they cast it they are dead if they dont get harm sheild off.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

He has asked in the past that if you put yourself in the MOBs shoes would you attack the healer or the fighter?<P>However, as fighters wielding large magical weapons, isn't it also more realistic for us to be doing more damage?  <P>In other words, backstab is a great idea.

</FONT><HR>I think there should be a new skill that is an improved taunt. While the warrior is attacking he can call names and stuff, but that taunt should be weaker. The improved taunt should require the warrior to stop fighting and dedicate himself to "pushing" the monster around. It might have a random chance of making the monster miss or hit the warrior instead of its target of choice. In either case, it should make the warrior rise much higher on the hate list. And it would fit with the idea of the warrior being a bully. After all, wouldn't you get mad at somebody who kept getting in your way or throwing rocks at you while you tried to kill the cleric for no particular reason?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Well guys, it seems that Verant thought that Warriors were holding the attention of the Mobs TOO well, which is why they lessened the Taunt associated with debuffs (Warriors were using Tash sticks to keep the Mob on them all the time) and why they increased the amount of aggro that healing a 51+ player causes.  <P>So it seems unlikely that they are going increase the Taunt ability until they have had a chance to see what effects their lastest modifications have had on the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
