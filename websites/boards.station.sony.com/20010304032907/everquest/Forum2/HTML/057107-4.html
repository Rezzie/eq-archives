</FONT><HR>well all you ebay people and item farmers have done is ruin the game. It was not meant to be played like this.it's at the point now you don't know who is even a twink it is so rampant and items can always be bought for real money or enuff plat.What you have done is make it impossible for anybody who wants to earn their stuff to do it right. I am so tired of showing up to try and get an item and some uber druid is camping it with 4 or 5 more of his druid buddies to sell on ebay or twink a character with, Hell most of the time they are way above the level to even be camping it. If you think i am wrong go to unrest to the basement and try to kill the dwarven ghost for a pair of dwarven boots, YOU WILL WAIT IN LINE FOR EBAYERS AND TWINKHEADS AND YOU WILL PROBABLY NEVER GET IN! I move that all items be made no drop, then all this nonsenses will stop ans the game can be played right. Too bad all you ebay and twinkies i don't care about your opinions at all. Heck make all magic items lore too. sounds good to me. JUST DON't FORGET NO DROP ALL ITEMS!

</FONT><HR>I have some friends that, after noticing the profit pontential on ebay that prompted their start in everquest. They promptly quit the game realizing how not fun it is to them not being able to make a profit at a later time. Sure its fun(at times..) but in the end and the begining thats all some people really wanted from EQ. Hell<BR>in this instance Ebayers are COMMING to EQ for that reason alone. I don't see a big difference if the item farmers sell it on ebay to someone who wont otherwise have a good chance at getting the item that they would spend real life money on it. Or selling it ingame to some other rich twinker who wants to improve their account same as the other player.<P>Verant encourages power gamming, ebayers help to discourage it in a way so why the hell not? The game has gone to the high lvl guilds and farmers now and either way the player that dosnt get to spend every waking hour on EverCrack gets shut out in the end. Sure they are having a blast, but when they realize what is out there that should be obtainable to them a casual player in the end is now just supposed to say, ahh its no biggy, ill tkae my half set of banded+bronze armor and my fine steel sword and wooden shild and make it all the way to 60 in 6years) 6 years of play ='s 720$'s if i did my math right. Thats 720$'s could have been better spent on food for the family and real life nessessities but no.. it was spent on EQ. Why shouldnt that person after 6 years of devoted casual playing be able to sell his\her account for even a section of that 720$'s back? Why is that a problem at all? Verant isnt loosing money, and the account stays active with someone else playing(paying). <P>*sigh*<BR>I over think things too much this is probobly one of thoese times, but maybe its better that I said all this..hell maybe its worse.

Because that person is not entitled to it.<BR>EQ is a game. Not a business venture. The $720.00 was spent playing the game, which means the payoff was in 'fun'. It sounds like you don't find the game terribly 'fun' (or at least, only occasionally). That's fine. People who don't think EQ is worth the money they pay will quit.<P>I say again: The only people entitled to make money on EQ are Verant, Sony, their affiliates, and their investors.

</FONT><HR>VI is wasting their time trying to shut down the ebay auctions. If they really want to stop the auctioning of items, they could just have a third party post an auction for them, accept payment for it, complete the in game exchange of the item so as not to commit fraud, and then immediately ban the account of whoever accepts the item. If people are afraid to buy things from the auctions those who sell items will have no one to sell to and the problem will go away on it's own. The reverse would work as well, have a third party buy items online then report the name of whoever delivers the item immediately to VI and ban the sellers account. This is a simple problem to solve, there will always be new sites to post auctions on, just eliminate peoples desire to participate in auctions and they will end. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'm sure this has been said before, and I'm sure it will be said again.  The problem is with the game mechanics.  The game could have been designed from the begining to make Ebay and twinking far less of a concern.  But it wasn't.  The game was designed intentionally or inadvertently, for farmers.<BR>What's the magical answer, you ask?  What's the solution to nearly every problem?<BR>It's the name of the game folks, EverQuest!!<BR>If all "uber" items were the result of a quest, then the game would not only be a lot more fun, but also make farming a thing of the past.<BR>But no, practically all the rare items are drops off mobs.  And you know what that means?  There's going to be someone there to farm them.<BR>Why does Trak happen to be carrying a super breastplate for several classes?  Because it was easier to program than giving a quest, that's why!<P>Verant should be fixing the source of the problem, not the symptom.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I am glad Verant is stopping ebaying any kind of selling items or characters for real money. I purchased the game and pay my monthtly fee to play the game, this entitles me to anything the game has to offer, but reality is a bit different certain items, certains are not possible for me to get because they are camped 24/7 by people selling on ebay for real cash or to outfit characters they want to sell for real cash, I am not interested in paying real cash for my items, and my enjoyement of the game is ruined by people who farm stuff for real cash as they take these items out of the in game economy to an outside economy and that is not goo for the game.<P>That is why Verant is doing this, because if they allow it, at some point the people who are not interest in spending real life cash for in game stuff will walk away from EQ, and these people far outnumbers the ebayer.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Just a quick question about Auctions:<P>I don't understand why Verant or any other vendor would have a problem with someone selling their ACCOUNT.  I totally understand "Farmed" items and such, but what about the person that has spent a year playing and has decided to move on?<P>WHY would that matter to Verant if that person wanted to sell their account for the time and money they had invested?  Verant KEEPS a paying customer, and NOBODY is hurt from this action.  (If so, could someone please elaborate?)<P>I'm not an E-Bay'r, but all this huff I read on other EQ sites just sounds kinda like Verant/Sony is playing GOD. (Maybe that's an overstatement, but I still don't see how ACCOUNT AUCTIONS would hinder the EQ game in ANY WAY..)<P>In simpler form, this sounds like Ford or GM saying that transfer of ownership on your car is in violation of the law.  You can say that's it Software, but it's still an item we all PAID FOR.<P>I am still addicted to EQ, but dictating what I do with the time and money I've spent on a product just doesn't sit well with me.<P>Just my thoughts.

</FONT><HR>Fraud: Buyer Beware (Should have NOTHING to do with Sony/Verant)<P>Roleplaying: Umm. I still have yet to SEE ANYONE "RolePlaying" on our server.  Just a simple fact in the 16 months I've played.  8(<BR>(I'm sure they are out there, but RP'ers seem to be almost as rare as Bilge Farfathom)<P>As for concerns of un-educated characters in the game, sure it happens.  And people are smart enough to NOT group with those people again. Heck, I've grouped with people that have played up to level 60 that I'd chose not to group with again.  Has nothing to do with how their character is played.<P>Again, I just can't think of anything off the top of my head that I've purchased that I can't sell.  Selling of items after you're done with them is common in the real world.  ie: Second hand shops, Music Exchanges, Used Cars, Pawn Shops, Flea Markets, Video Game exchanges..<P>I also know of people that have TRADED Accounts from one class to another.  They have played the other classes and certainly know how those classes are played, but wind up trading a post 50 for a post 50..  Verant's rules don't allow for this either.<P>I don't REALLY care either way, I'm just looking for answers that make sense to me.  Back to the roleplaying side of the argument: Most of us work all day long and use EQ as an "Escape."  It's a test of tactics, a place where friends meet to chat, stress relief, etc...  For those of you "True RP'ers" out there, I'm sorry if me and the 2150 other players on your servers nightly are ruining your experience by not becoming our characters: I play for FUN and FRIENDS.  I do enough RP at work!  8)<P>I'm done.

</FONT><HR>I agree with the last poster about the TRANSFERRING of accounts. I wonder simply why this is not allowed.  The reasons I have heard are:<P>1. FRAUD: This could be dealt with in a number of ways.  Similiar to transferring a mortgage or autoloan.  Geesh you can even transfer your utilites with a simply name change form.  <P>They could mandate that the original account holder has to fill out a transfer request form giving up all claims to the account.  They could charge a $30.00 fee for this service or equivialant to the cost of the original CD thus receiving the same amount of money as if the buyer bought a brand new account.<P>They could then re-issue a new password and charater name so others would not think "Joe" was the real "Joe".  <P>2: NEWBIE LVL 50+:  Can't help with this issue although the name change would be helpful.  You take a risk anytime you group with someone you do not know so I really don't see how this is soley a "transfer" problem.  <P><BR>Maybe I am missing something, feel free to enlighten me.  I just don't see why the accounts can't be transferred.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>To all those that don't understand why someone that has spent 1, 2 or more years playing shouldn't be allowed to sell there account, here is the good comparison.<P>Join a Health Club, or a Golf Club, or any other association of those types.  Those 'memberships' are 'non-transferable'.  Same thing here.  <P>To try to compare EQ to buying a car, driving around in it, fixing up the sound, getting a better paint job and then reselling it to recover some of the money put into the car is a flawed comparision.  The only part of EQ you own is the CD's.  And, once these are registered to you and you agree to the EULA, then you no longer have to right to sell those CD's to someone else, as those registration keys have already been used.<P>Now, I could see the arguement that if you deleted every character on every server that you had, you might be able to justify the transfer of ownership of the CD's and registration codes to another person.<P>As to the bit about selling in game items.  Well, that part I understand where some people stand on the issue, as I too have had rare spawn/drops gacked out from under me by some KSer of a higher level.  Probably for the purpose of Twinking another character, or maybe because they didn't want to mess around with it at lower levels.<P>But, as long as there are those out there that don't have the time/interest to spend on getting the items by them selves or through grouping, you will always have people willing to pay real life money.  And, as long as there are people willing to pay RL$ there will always be people who would consider it idiotic not to sell to them.<P>What is the real affect on Farming?<P>I have monitored Ebay since I started playing in July of 2000, and, have seen the mass majority of the auctions go unpurchased.  The most common purhcased items were PP in the multiple 1000's range, and items that would be considered roughly equal to their amount of PP.  Not very uncommon to have seen 10000pp go for about 150.00 to 250.00.  And, items that sold for roughly the same amount of pp have sold for about 1/2 to 2/3 their pp rating on that server.<P>So, what has been purchased the most would appear to be the massive amounts of Plat needed to purchase items IG.  As an exchange rate goes, it is roughly 15.00 per 1000pp when sold in bulk and as much as 30.00 per 1000pp when purhcased in single 1000pp sales.<P>What causes this inflation in the price of items?  Simply put, their difficulty level to be obtained.<BR>Why are they, often times, so difficult to be had?  Combination of factors:<BR>First:  Rareness of Spawn<BR>Second:  Rareness of Drop<BR>Third:  Percieved Value of the Item (for resale either in or out of game)<BR>Fourth:  Number of people that are camping the spawn for the drop<P>Simple solution:  I wouldn't, as a DM/GM/ST, allow characters that are obviously out of level for the encounter (lvl 30 characters in D&D are not put up against lvl 10 encounters and when they do match up against these encounters, they get no XP and nothing of value is dropped off of them, DM's perogative).  So, why doesn't Verant look into the Farming issue from this standpoint.<P>If you are a lvl50 Magician and you want to help a lvl20 Magician get that nifty item, bring that lvl20 Magician along with you.  He gets to fight the encounter, you just provide support.  When he/she gets the item, you bug out and let others take the spawn.<P>Ways to limit Farming, make more of these items Lore or Limited Lore Items.  Makeing it impossible for one character to have more then, say for the Limited Lore Items, two of them at one time.  GBS for example.  You can only use two, so why not build in a limit of two on the character (not the account, you may have more then one character you want them for).<P>Further solutions, make the benifits of some items of the nature of weapon procs.  The +Int Robe that you shouldn't be able to get your hands on till you are lvl18 or better, doesn't work until a few lvls before or right at 18.<P>Sure, these may seem like penalties, but, think about it in terms of a Roleplaying game.  Do you give your lv1 characters Rods of Polymorph, or Bags of Holding? Do you run your lvl 125 (yes I have seen these lvl campaigns) Warrior against some lvl 5 Malitia Men. . . No.  At least, not as something to get XP or items from.<BR>Possibly there will be some at the very beginning of a campaign on the way to the, say, lvl 150 Witch, but you also weren't planning on trying to take that Witch out alone where you, you did bring friends right.<P>So, basically, make the items work only within certain lvls.  Make the items not drop if someone above the appropriate lvl, by what ever math they decide to use, kills the creature.  Make sure that players understand they are to be progressing along in their encounters, not farming items for sale in EC or Ebay.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>If people want to buy items, there will be people who will sell them.  That is the bottom line.  Whether it is right or wrong is irrelevant.  To end the buying and selling, Verant has to discourage people from that practice.<P>At the same time, this has to be cost effective.  If *bad-ebayer* was to sell on ebay or another auction site, in say quantities of 50k or more, and use a dummy account purely for the sale, they would likely care little, if their $30 dummy account was banned after receiving $500+ in the transaction.  <P>Cost effective also includes the cost of paying someone per hour to police all the auction sites for "illegal" auctions.  I quote illegal, in that it has not been proven in court to be illegal as of yet.  I agree Verant can ban an account, at their sole option, for violating their user agreement.  This does not make the action necessarily illegal - ie a criminal activity in which you can spend time in prison for doing.<P>How do you stop people from being motivated to buy and/or sell items/accounts?  If every item was made no-drop, this would end in game transfer of items.  At the same time, *bad-ebayer* could just sell looting rights to something they are camping.  Not a perfect solution, and at the same time, removes the in game economy which Verant obviously desires.<P>I personally enjoyed looking at ebay, surveying the really nice objects my character may one day pursue.  If I had millions of extra dollars to spend on anything, ebay would be tempting; it was tempting before, and I'm not exactly over abounding in cash.  The problem with ebay, or similar sites, the items gained are not earned and thus don't bring pride in their ownership.  I realize pride is a deadly sin, but for lack of possessing this deadly sin over an object of binary code on a server somewhere, the auction route is not for me.<P>Having not sold on ebay, with no plans to sell on ebay or similar sites in the future, I still twink my characters.  I love the game, so much in fact that I have two accounts active at this time (and have had up to four accounts going at one time).  If I have a higher level character who can kill a mob easier, a lower level twink can benefit from this.  <P>I see nothing wrong with camping an item for a drop.  If others want the spawn, as per the play nice policies (even before them), simply alternate.  I don't understand people posting... *bad-ebayer* camping something 6 months straight and I can never get in on it.  Or uber-guild doing the same.  Simply show up with a group, and say "We want to camp this too, please alternate with us."  Simple to use, if you really want to invoke the Play Nice Policies.  No *bad-ebayer* could camp a spawn for 6 months straight on you.  So that arguement is only valid, if you're uneducated - don't read Verant's own policies.<P>Anyway, cannot think of a good way to prevent sales of items on auction sites, without destroying the in game economy.  Since Verant has to be cost effective (its a business for them), wants to preserve the economy system they have worked so hard to create, and as of yet cannot pursue legal action (I'm assuming) this is hard.  Any that you catch, ban away.  <P>Problem with that approach is that its going to be hard to catch those who are careful.  Not sure a solution.  If all items were free, simply walk up to a guild leader and say "Give me an SMR".. repeat, filling in the blank for any item desired.  Well auctions would close, as anyone could have anything.  At the same time, risk/reward and the goal of obtaining levels and experience to get stuff is gone.  <P>*Tired* here.  Stopping this post here, comment if you like.  If you feel like flaming, go ahead but know you're wasting your time, as I'll just scroll down, should I even return to view this message ever.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Seems like contrary to people hope will happen, less farming, as the result of ebay policing and banning, actually the opposite is likely to happen.  Now the only type of permissible transfers are in game pp transfers or trades.  Which means more of the stuff that was always farmed for ebay will now be farmed for pp.  All of this makes for a less efficient economy.  On the other hand, people are more likely to have to earn what they need which may be the balance that VI is trying to strike.  Nonetheless, don't be fooled...this will lead to more farming.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I don't see what all the fuss about selling accounts/items is. It seems to me that the players that are upset about it are trying to pass off their morals on others. By this I mean they seem to think it is imoral (in their opinion) and therefore it is imoral for everyone. I have no idea what they are thinking. Just a disclaimer I have not ever used Ebay. As for all these analogies I see there will always be flaws found in each one. What this post all boils down to is this: if after buying the game and installing it and disagreeing with the liscence agreement, can I contact VI or Sony and have them refund the purchase price? Most likely not. So how do you think they will ever stop people from selling items/accounts and continue to keep the game fun for everyone? They can't! As for the people complaining about grouping with a lvl 50 newbie don't make me call you a moron. Just leave the group. If you are dumb enough to stay in a group where a high lvl char seems to be a newbie you can either leave or convince the group to kick them out. Use your brains, please don't tell me EQ had completely erroded them. (If so you have been playing too long, kinda like me  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">).<BR>Just a small coment on that guy that said all VI needs to do is act like a buyer then close the account, hmm are you assuming that sellers are morons? Just because they are doing something deemed "immoral" by the EQ community doesn't make them stupid. I really can care less if they can sell or can't sell, but I do think VI is about due to have one heck of a large lawsuit slapped onto them. &lt;--- Thinks of the all powerful Microsoft and plans on his next game before sony gets broken into little depts  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>     Although in the future i see Verant allowing selling of accounts, as of right now it isnt allowed. <P>ALthough Ebayers can probably be classified<BR>into many categories, i think they are two primary ones.<P>1. The people who try to make a liveing on EQ, who farm, camp items, and such. Personally i think this is horrible, and should be stamped out. Although i think Verrant could take care of these problems easier by makeing more things nodrop. For instance on the jboots quest, why not just have the boots drop off the AC...<P>2. People who sell there accounts, when they are tired of the game and move on. I dont really see nothing wrong with this. All that level 50 newbie talk is kinda silly i think. Almost everyone is in a guild anyways at high levels, and group with the same people anyways. And if they where a newbie, just leave. I die of lost connections alot more than ebay level 50 newbies. <P>I might be wrong but i think when newer games come out, Verrant will take a more relaxed stance to account selling.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"1. Give every weapon/armor lvl requirments or the magic ones atleast<BR>2. Everything nodrop"<P>I vote for 1, level requirements.  But you'll have to rework the game so that you can actually acquire an item in a level where that weapon is still useful.<P>texture<BR>DE druid<P>.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057107-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057107.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057107-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057107-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057107&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057107&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
