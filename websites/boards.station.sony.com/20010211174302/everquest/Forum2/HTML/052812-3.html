</FONT><HR>even though it has been posted, all i have to saY is i agree whole haeartedly, and i would like to thank BOdi for his list here, and the entire monk community for making it happen!<P>This post has been compiled from a very large thread from Zadkiel Hopeseeker's Monkly-Business website. The majority of this post was originally written by Kaiele Katarn, of the Innoruuk Server. <P>The main issue that Monks currently face is dealing damage in the end game. Prior to Kunark, and the changes in the melee skill caps, we where ahead of all other classes in dealing melee damage with the exception of a backstabbing rogue (which is as it should be). <P>Since our damage was based on our higher skill caps, and those skill caps were raised for all other melee classes with the Kunark expansion, the gap has closed dramatically. Damage dealing is the only potential a monk adds to a group, especially due to changes in the way the Feign Death skill works, and mobs' reactions to Feign Death. <P>Currently, a monk offers very little to a group due to the changes in damage. A warrior has higher hitpoints, higher AC, and higher magic resistance -- and thanks to the loss of a skill cap advantage for monks and new, extremely high ratio Velious and Kunark weapons for warriors, monks no longer have a clear advantage in dealing damage over a warrior. <P>Because the skill caps cannot be raised for monks to re-establish damage potential from that side due to programming issues, we would like to propose the following changes for the monk class.<P>DAMAGE INCREASE<P>1) Some type of upgrade to damage output. Rogues are incredibly powerful when they are behind a mob. Warriors are incredible tanks. Monk damage -- either with an "uber" staff or with epic fists -- should be halfway between a rogue's potential when the rogue is behind a mob using a Ragebringer and a warrior who is attacking with his/her best weapons. Keep in mind 10/16 and 13/20 weapons for warriors when rebalancing our damage. There are many ways to tune this damage, but PLEASE do not resort to another UBER-rare staff that will only balance the 1% of the monk population lucky enough to get one of these drops.<P>2) Raise fist damage post-50 for those without epics. While the delay continues to drop, the damage never increases once a monk hits level 50. Very few monks use fists anymore, but this would make the RP'ers and casual players a tad more viable near the end-game, if they ever get there. <P>3a) Encourage usage and training of lesser monk special attacks. Either allow us to use one type of strike and one type of kick at the same time by unhooking the special attack re-use timers post-50, or give the possibility of attack "strings". (This is the preferred solution, but would be harder to implement.) If a monk successfully uses Flying Kick on an enemy -- connects for damage -- then give a chance (based on Double Attack skill, preferably) for the monk to automatically use Dragon Punch/Tail Rake. If Dragon Punch/Tail Rake connects for damage, give a slightly lesser chance of doing an Eagle Strike. This is not only an interesting solution, it would make raising all of the monk special attack skills more important. This would be a post-50 enchancement, or when a monk reaches 200 skill in Flying Kick.<P>--- If this is technically not reasonable from a coding standpoint, then a secondary option would be: <P>3b) Minimum damage on Flying Kick. It won't make a huge difference in our damage output, but it will at least make us FEEL better. There is nothing worse than doing a flying kick for 3 damage as a post-50 monk. Even making this minimum damage cap post-50 only would be an improvement, and would not unbalance the pre-50 game where monks did have an advantage.<P>Damage Increase Suggestions:<P>To recap, a level 50's fist is a 14/30 weapon, which reduces (in delay only) to 14/26 at level 60. One suggestion is to have the damage increase (as it does for the rest of the levels) post 50 as well, so that a Monks fist at 60 is 16/26.<P>One of the best suggestions that has come from the many Monks is too have the main hand damage bonus applied to the off hand.<P>This is becasue Monks are the masters of Duel-Wield. We get it as a level 1 skill, and gain 7 points per level, capping faster and higher than any other class. This indicates a natural affinity for the monk to use his off-hand, a kind of natural/trained ambidexterity.<P>Allowing us to strike just as hard with the off-hand as the primary will solve the damage-dealing problem and bring us up to the correct damage level of being between warriors and rogues.<P>Other suggestions on ways to increase damage include having a minimum damage of level/2 for special attacks such as Flying Kick, or add some kind of level damage bonus to the special attacks, but the off hand damage bonus is the most favoured solution.<P>4) Improve Feign Death. Leave it as it currently functions in all but two areas -- If the monk is not removed from the mob's haste list and does not get a "has fallen to the ground" message, give the monk an automatic "Evade"-type effect. In other words, allow a monk to sacrifice a couple of combat rounds to lower him- or herself on the hate list. This would DRAMATICALLY increase monk survival rates on uber-mobs, when we're causing intense aggro with epic fists or other high end weapons. It also provides a check to ensure that monk damage is not overly high, if Verant is still worried about that. Finally, since this is linked to a SKILL, it still has a chance to fail, just like a rogue's evade skill. Also, fix the "no failure message, but the mob just keeps beating on me after the eighteenth feign attempt in a row" problem that I and many other monks have encountered in the post-50 world, especially while grouped in Velious.<P>One possible suggestion was to have something like "%T has seen through your ruse" when a Mob attacks after a succesful feign, simalar to the fact that Rogues know when they have sneaked succesfully, and another for resisted Spells not breaking Feign.<P>5) Fix the Celestial Fist effect. Celestial Tranquility is a great effect on our epic, but it stacks with almost NOTHING. Most monks rarely solo post-50, and most common group buffs will keep the effect from working. (Call of Earth, enchanter haste spells, most bard songs, Speed of the Shissar, etc.) At least alter it so that even if the haste is not usable due to other, better buffs then the additional effects -- the extra +AC and +ATK -- will stack anyway, similar to the way the Robe of the Whistling Fists worked. It's pretty bad when a well-meaning ranger tosses me Call of Earth and costs me 40ATK and 12AC. The ranger buff especially does not make sense because Call of Earth is NOT a Haste Buff, and the Celestial Tranquility Effect will indeed stack with the upgrade, Strength of Earth.<P>Also the Celestial Fists wearers, felt that a graphic for the hands would be better than the hand wraps.<P>6) Increase Warrior, Paladin, and ShadowKnight taunting skills. Yes, I know this isn't an enhancement to MONKS, but it would DEFINITELY help us out. WE ARE NOT TANKS. Unfortunately, it's very hard to taunt off of us due to our extreme aggro, ESPECIALLY with our low-damage, low-delay epic fists. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE implement this one change if you don't make any other!!<P>7) At least consider spreading the weight limit increase out over the post-50 levels. Few monks will make 55. Even fewer will make 60. Therefore, weight increases at those two points are not terribly useful. A 2lb increase every other level (i.e., 52, 54, 56, etc) would result in a weight limit of 24 at 60. A 1lb increase every post-50 level would be another way to implement the changes, and would also result in a weight limit of 24 at level 60. If these are "too much" of a weight increase (the current max weight limit at 60 is 22lbs, from four-pound increases at 55 and 60) then skip levels 55 and 60, when we get our passive enhancements of +1 HP per tick while feigned.<P>The following are additional information gathered from other Monks posts, covering Skills, Disciplines, Armour and Quests.<P>SKILLS<P>Mend Perhaps Mend at a skill of 201+ can have a small chance of curing disease/poison. The increase chance to cure will rise as the skill goes above 201+.<P>Skill Caps Kick caps at 250. So why does Flying kick, eagle strike, and dragon punch all cap at 230?<P>Also, it was recently announced that they upped the caps for the Hand to Hand skill to equal 1hb/2hb, but all that was raised was the 60 cap, the 50 cap is still only 225 compared with 1hb/2hb cap of 240, so the 50 cap needs to be increased to 240 as well.<P>Higher Dodge, Riposte & Block. This is a concern for high level Monks in regards to the Big Game Hunts. <P>With higher skills in these areas, this would give Monks a unique way to tank better - Plate classes absorb damage with their higher hps, Rogues use stealth (evade) to not get hit, and monks just flat out use speed (block/dodge/riposte) to make the mob miss them. <P>Either increase the 3 skills from there current caps of 225/230 to 252, or have higher percentage chances of working (if that is not taken into consideration with a higher skill)<P>DISCIPLINES<P>Thunderkick This needs to be worked on, as currently it is being reported that 24 damage comes up the majority of the time. Possible suggestions include it becoming an innate or a timed discipline where every kick within the disciplines duration can be a thunderkick, {b} the minimum damage on TK to be 1 to 1.5 * level, (so a 60th level Monk will not kick for less than 60-90 damage with it), {c} add a short stun to Thunderkick, or {d} make TK a special attack after flying kick, gained at 50+th level or so.<P>These suggestions assume that the damage is not based from the FK damage table, and flying kick is not improved in any of the above afore mentioned ways.<P>We would like all the disciplines to receive an increase in length, and looking at the new hybrid disciplines, no one else has every discipline last for short periods of time.<P>ARMOUR<P>Monk armour needs some natural AC progression. It would be nice to see all cresent pieces (obtainable at around level 30) being 1 point more AC then cured silk (obtained at level 15) shiverback (obtained at 46+) being 1-2 AC greater than cresent, and Velious quest armour (obtained at level 50+) being 1-2 greater than shiverback. Each piece should have a higher AC than the same piece of the previous type. <P>Also, why does our equipment seem to have less (overall) in stats, resists, and clickable effects then other melee classes?<P>Armour Cured Crescent Shiver Velious Black Panther Other <BR>Leggings AC5  AC3 +stats +svs AC5 +stats +svs AC6 +stats + svs +hp +Effect AC8 +stats Gators AC 7 +stats, +hp <BR>Arms AC4 AC3 +stats +hp AC5 +stats AC7 +stats, svs, hps AC7 +stats, svs Azures AC 12 <BR>Bracer AC3 ---- AC4 +stats, +svs AC6 +stats, +svs, + effect AC6 +stats, +hp Vox AC 7 <BR>Gloves AC4 AC3 +stats +svs AC5 +stats, +effect, +svs AC10 +svs, +stats, +hps AC7 +stats Treants AC 8 <P><BR>This table refers to a selection of our armour, and the other column is what a normal 35th to 40th level Human Monk currently wears. As noted, these Monk only pieces do not have any kind of progression AC wise, which ultimately is one of the main things ppl look for. <P>As shown, Crescent has a lower AC than Cured, Blank Panther armour, which is Tailored (admittedly at high skill) is mostly better than Velious armour. <P>If Shiverback AC was raised to the AC level of the Black Panther armour, and the Velious armour AC rasied to that beyond Black Panther, I think that the vast majority of Monks would be very pleased. You will not increase a Monks AC, only make Monks want to wear their own armour.<P>To clarify, not one Monk is asking for more AC on pieces than we are already wearing, simply the AC of Monk only armour to be brought in line. If Velious sleeves had an AC of 10, they would be worn by many Monks over the Azure Sleeves they have worn for the past 30+ levels.<P>MONK QUESTS<P>Treant Fists. Make them have a slight effect (whether attack raised by 1 to 10, a small self only heal or even an effect like summoning bandages), or alter the stats enough to make the Monks of that level want to do the (35hr average long) quest, rather than the all to easy Gem Inlaid Guantlets, which provides a very simalar quest result in a fraction of the time.<P>The Collar of Neshika. The Collar itself is to heavy, and the weight needs to be greatly reduced from 1.5, perhaps down to 0.2, and adding one AC, would make the quest worth completing (and wearing over a Undead Collar)<P>Iksar Quests I belive their final quest (whistling Fist?) is still unfinished, and needs to be looked into.<P>This post does not cover everything, and as mentioned is compiled from many to help you decide what we think is required. Monks upto level 50, we believe are balanced, and it really is the end game (50 to 60th) that things need to be addressed.<P>Bodi Kibadachi, Bristlebane.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>  Monks, monks are pretty cool, and are lacking but TWO things.  The rest is gravy.<P>  A small damage boost which would cement their role as Pure damage dealer above the warrior, below the rogue.  An offhand bonus (maybe half of the primary bonus) would correct this.  A stringing-together of specials (maybe one fist/one foot) might also help alleviate the problem.<P>  The second thing is feign not evading, in a group or raid situation.  Monks need to stop dying because mobs won't forget about them through feign.  What was the most useful skill is now failing, despite passing the skill checks.<P>  The last issue is a min damage on Flying Kick, 3 damage is humiliating, especially seeing a poor monk hit for 3 with his disc.<P>  Otherwise, the rest is extras, un-needed, or even extravagent.<P>  Trilian Soulwind<BR>51 bard<BR>  Vage Duskbringer<BR>40 monk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Skills-<P>   Thank You, Thank You, Thank You for increasing H2H equal th 1HB!<P>   I think with the recent changes implemented in velious that makes feign pulling difficult without a backup puller, Feign Death could be changed. Post 35 mobs still have the same chances to mem-wipe, but for every 3 seconds you stay down after they begin to walk away, the chance of them mem-wiping would go up 5%, so we don't need to /q to mem-wipe anymore. Something along these lines or another suggestion that will be easier to code.<BR>Although above all I would like to see feign pulling not be activly discouraged or have mobs recoded against it, but be endorsed as a very tough, but, acceptable tactic.<P>   Flying kick needs a minimum damage, and Thunderkick should have a minumum of triple that. for Flying Kick maybe (LVL*40)/75 or something along those lines.<P>   A nice thing just to help out monks could be a level 25 discipline that lasts as long as the refresh time that allows you a chance to stun with special attacks. This would only mean you can't use disciplines while in stun mode.<P>Equipment-<P>   Treant Fists, what can I say. The stats are almost identical to the Gem inlaid gauntlets, but I can do the Gem inlaid gauntlet quest roughly 9 or 10 times, or more with the help of a druid, in the time it takes to do the Treant fist quest. And I can do it much earlier in level. Risk does not equal reward in both these occasions. I would like to see a right clickable effect (summon bandages, snare, Skin of Wood), a very small haste effect (5ish %), or better H2H performance like the celestial fists for this major, week long quest that used to be a right of passage for a monk.<P>   It would be nice if monk quest items would be reduced in weight. It stands to reason that an monk items made by monks would be made as lightly as possible. It seems that in velious any eq monk usable is too heavy, and much of what is not monk usable is 0.1wt.<P>   I would also like to see some newbie monk weapons. Maybe a 6/29 1hb obtainable in befallen or blackburrow that is monk only and can be gotten at roughly level 10-15 for our younger brothers so they can see what monks are like with and without weapons and can try both out. And have newbie monks start with a couple 4/36 1hbs that weighs 1.0 or something, same damage and delay as fists.<P>   Also some mid level weapons, for the brothers to high for fighting batons, but too low for old sebilis.<P>-Damage Output<P>   I personally feel that rogues should outdamage us by a significant margin from behind a mob, as a rogue will then usually become the sole target of the mobs aggression and the rest of the group has to compete to taunt it off. I also believe Warriors should have beter AC and HP than monks. But I do believe that monks should, from the front, be the end all and be all for damage. PVP is not a fair way to test class balance, mobs are. Monks should have higher minimum damage ratings than other classes to help this out as our damage in combat is slightly higher than warriors as it is. <P>   We should be able to have the third attack, as our double attack caps higher (250 instead of 245) than a warriors, it does make sense that we would be as good or better at multiple attacks, and with normally having a less delay on our weapons in exchange for lower damage rating, we should attack more in a round.<P>Summation-<P>   In the old days, monks were brought into groups for damage dealing, when monks learned the art of feign pulling and warriors got higher damage weapons and cool skills like third attack, Monks got invited into groups to pull. Now with the changes to velious, I get into groups mostly just because certain people like having me around to entertain them and cause I know my way around. We are losing class distinction, and are becoming poor warriors that can't carry loot and bleed clerics mana. I feel either upping the damage to considerable again, or coming out for feign pulling and recoding velious to make it a viable alternative, or revamping the class to give us a distincion seperate from the two I mentioned above, is necessary to keep monks alive. There is little now that we contribute to a group that a warrior or a rogue can't do as well, but they also contibute taunting, or thief abilities respectivly.<P>Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I appreciate your efforts in attempting to balance the classes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I believe Dark_Avatar has talked about several points that are kinda interesting.<P>1st Damage bonus in off hand would overbalance monks who have celestial fists or even jade maces.  Furthermore, it would make using awesome lower delay weaps(staff of shielding, adamantite club, etc) and 2hb (tranq staff) less appealing.  We would either see only the CF (celestial fist) monks or the lower level Jade Mace and Wu Stick monks or the even lower level Fighting Baton monks.  Some kind of offhand bonus would be cool though, and would help balance dmg dealing power.  I suggest a offhand bonus for weapons of higher delay (25 delay and above).  Then we'd see the CF, AC, SoS, Jade Mace, Wu Stick, Knuck Duster, Fighting Batons, and even fists used in different combos with each other (kinda like it is now, but the lower delay as well as dmg ratio would be appealing traits for the offhand weap).  A slight addition to monk 2hb bonus is needed too (but something small considering how powerful these weaps already are).<P>2nd Chains.  If you've ever played a Capcom fighting game like Street Fighter, you'll see chains.  This can be implemented into EQ, allowing special attacks like flying kick and dragon punch to chain after each other in combos (example: kick, kick, roundkick, flying kick).  Make it so monks can do certain chains only at a certain lvl (post 35 monks can look forward to addition of new chains, varrying in length and which specials are used in them, like they did for new skills pre 35).  Furthermore, the chain is broken with a miss so monks would have to keep all skills high.  The reset times of the special and thus the chain is dependent on the reset time of the final special attack (therefore special attacks ending in dragon punch allows a monk to recycle faster than a chain that ended in flying kick).  At higher levels, make it possible to chain two weaker chains, or give longer chains that the end result procs a stun/snare/etc.  Also make some of the higher level chains only usable by monks that have gone through certain quests to learn them.  Graphic wise, and a little concept wise, it'd be like instill doubt, but with more dmg =).  With the difficulty of landing all attacks to complete a chain it would make monks not overpowered, but more unique and interesting to play and with a little more dmg that goes towards balance.<P>3rd Manual Block.  I don't think anyone has mentioned this, but i just thought of it when i mentioned Street Fighter.  Why not a manual block that would work like stone stance meets evade?  Make it so the monk's attack would be turned off and he wouldn't be able to move while on manual block.  Dmg received is lowered and up resistance a bit with this move to block caster attack spells.  It could be used kinda like evade...tanking dmg a bit while agro goes back to a more appropriate tank.  Also good for pulling casters, they start casting, hit manual block, return to normal cat and mouse chase, etc.  No biggy, but might help balance monk tank capabilities a bit.<P>4th Min Dmg on Flying Kick.  My lvl 56 monk FKs for 3 and Thunder Kicks for 24.  OMG, how LAME!<P>5th Double Special Attack.  This would be like double backstab, but that doesn't really make a monk more unique...just giving him what the rogues had.  I like the idea of chains more because of the chance of missing attacks, the uniqueness of it, and the need to use more skills (and puts verants efforts on special moves graphics to use).  I'm only behind this idea as a way to add more dmg towards balance...but it's nowhere as fun as chains.<P>6th Tripple Attack.  I was shocked to hear warriors get this and monks don't considering monks were supposed to be the uber battle spammers.  I don't think it's that big of a deal, since you guys say it doesn't go off that much.  /Shrug...again not so original, but would go towards better dmg balance.  I'd rather have the high delay, offhand dmg bonus.  Ok, this may be unmonkly of me to ask for lower delay bonus and no tripple attack (not very battle spam like), but warriors already have trip attack, let's be more original.<P>7th Increased Movement Rate.  Ok, this is no biggy, and not sure if it really goes towards balance issues.  It just seems to me, that a monk who has dedicated his life to mastering his body, and is wearing clothes that makes him virtually nekkid, and who is carrying less weight than any other class, should be able to run faster than armored up tanks who carry over 100 more stones in weight and weakling casters with long robes who carry 50 more stones in weight.  It just makes more sense that monks should naturally run faster.  I'm not asking for magic movement enhancement on par with SoW and Jboots, just a little something for lower lvl monks to decrease travel time and make instill doubt a little more effective.  No biggy for me since i already have jboots, but monks running faster just seems obvious...<P>It's rather obvious to me that at my lvl, the warrior on the raids that i go on can do almost as much damage as me, has tons more HP and AC than me, has some pretty awesome discs, and is just a far better melee unit than me.  The rogue backstab.../drooooool.  The only thing i have over these fellows on a raid is that i get survival guilt from FD lol.  Finally, I think the monk is a fun class.  It was my first class before knowing what they or the other melee classes could do.  If i could do everything over again...I'd probably still go monk...though that rogue backstab.../droooool.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Deficiencies of the Monk class:<P>1.  Our damage output is only marginally higher than warriors and rangers (and in many cases lower if the warrior is well equipped), and is still vastly lower than a rogue.  I do not think this is consistent with the monk's role in Everquest.  Supposedly, we sacrifice a lot of AC/HP for an increased attack ability, and I don't think we're supposed to be sacrificing 30% of our HP and some of our AC for a 5% increase in damage over warriors.  This problem could be solved in many ways.<P>A.  Increase our skill caps<BR>B.  Give us new and improved weapons that are not so uber that only 1% of level 60 monks in Uber Uber guilds can obtain.  If you do release more weapons, please make them "Monk only".<BR>C.  Un-bind the Strike and Kick attacks.  A monk could use Flying Kick and a Tiger Claw independently of one another.<BR>D.  Give us a minimum damage bonus (a.k.a strength bonus a.k.a. level bonus) on our off-hand.<BR>E.  There absolutely must be a minimum damage to Flying Kick.  It is humiliating for me (level 53) to do a Flying Kick on a fire beetle and only do 3 damage.  The damage formula for Flying Kick must be tweaked.  <P>2.  The AC on our armor is extremely poor.  I realize that a Monk is meant to have lower AC than other tank classes, and I agree with that notion.  However, at level 53 I do not have a single piece of "Class specific" armor except for one Shackle.  Why would a monk wear a Silver Moon Headband (6ac 1svAll) when he could be wearing a Froglok Crown (12ac 20svFire/Cold)?  Why would a monk be wearing Shiverback arms when they have half the AC of Azure sleeves?  I want to wear my monkly armor, and wear it with pride.  But by doing so, I would be giving myself an AC handicap.  90% of what level 50+ monks wear they've been wearing for the last 20 levels, and only a tiny percentage of it is "Monk" armor.  Give us a reason to wear our own armor.  Now, please do not confuse what I'm asking for.  <P>**(I am NOT asking for a monk's total AC to increase, I just want to be able to wear my Monk Planes armor and have the same amount of AC I have now.)<P>3.  A slightly improved FD would be nice.  Probably the most appealing part of having a monk in the group is the ability to Feign Pull, but that is extremely awkward and dangerous now.  By improving Feign you would be helping to restore the monk's ability to pull and you would also be decreasing a group's REQUIREMENT of having an Enchanter (Improved FD = Less trains = Mez is not a necessity).<P>4.  These are just some nice 'extras' I'd like to see thrown into the game for monks. <BR>A.  Mend having some innate special ability at higher levels.  As it is now, there is no difference between 100 skill in mend and 200 skill.  Maybe a chance to cure poison/disease or restore more than 25% of your hp.<BR>B.  Warriors get critical hits with Melee weapons.  Rogues get critical hits with Ranged weapons.  Rangers get critical hits with Bows.  Monks are the only "damage dealing class" that do not get Critical hits.  I'd like to see a Monk's Special attacks (Flying kick, tiger claw, tail rake, etc) have a 5% chance of scoring a critical hit which would add 5% to the total damage.  A 5% increase in damage to 5% of our special attacks (which is a small percentage of our total damage) is nothing.  This is just for flavor.<P>P.S. I love my class, I just sometimes get the feeling I'm becoming uncompetitive.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok the problem with monks all started at the realease of Kunark. pre-kunark monks were perfectly balanced imo. We did a well amount of damage over warriors, and close/even to rogues.  <P>after kunark, monk didn't get hardly any skill increases. while warriors were going from 200 to 252  monks were going from 250 to 252.    so now all our skills are even or very close.  and we no longer can do more damage than warriors. and we get totally owned by rogues now.    we cant tank even close to warriors, and were on par with rogues for tanking ability (which is bad, we dont tank.)    All these complaints i've seen are post 50 complaints about the class, which are wrong, monks are perfectly fine post 50, after 50 is where we lose ALOT of power. <P>Basically the only suggestion i can give for us monks get upgraded is a) give us a "hp bonus"   b) since we dont do the 15-25% more dmg over a warrior, raise our haste cap 15-25% higher and give us innate haste  post 50.  c) give us a minimum flying kick the same as rogues,  while rogues min backstab is like 70-80?  at 60,  while not even our Thunderkick is close to that,  our min. flying kick is 3,  our min. thunderkick is 24,  this is a joke,  this is a discipline which cant be used every 5 seconds like a rogue, but rather every 3 mins.      <P>basically what im saying is Kunark wrecked the monk class, and you should fix it.<P>NoHands<BR>59monk - AR<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Monks are currently number 2 in damage dealt behind rogues and slightly above Warriors. I believe monks need an increase of damage to seperate themselves from warriors and to close the damage gap held by rogues.<P>To do this, i propose the following changes:<P>1) The skill cap for all special attacks should be set to 252 at level 60. Currently, only the Kick skill can reach this mastery while the other useful attacks cap at 230. This would slightly increase damage output thru existing skills.<P>2) All special attacks should have a minimum damage modifier based on Level. I will not propose an exact number for each skill, I will leave that to you to decided. This will increase damage output slightly thru existing skills.<P>3) The discipline Thunderkick needs to be modified to increase damage potential. In it's current form, it is marginally useful. In fact, I never use it at lvl 54. Instead I save Stone Stance for when I need to absorb a large amout of damage to ensure group survival.<P>First, the minimum damage level should be set equal to the level of the monk, 52 - 60. This will elimate the embarassing kicks for 24 and slightly increase damage dealt.<P>Next I propose two options for increasing the viability of the skill. My first proposal is, make Thunderkick a special attack. Monks recieve no special attack upgrades after Flying kick is aquired. Make it a skill aquired at lvl 52 and do not add a discipline at 52. This should increase damage slightly from it's current level.<P>My second proposal is, make any kick landed within the current time allowed to land a Thunderous Kick should land as a Thunderous Kick. This is a much more slight increase, but does add viability to the discipline. Not my personal favorite, but a deffinate improvement.<P>4) Increase the damage on Fists post 50. Currently, fist damage is stagnant from level 50 on at 14 while delay continues to decrease as it has the entire life of a monk. I believe fist damage should continue to increase just as it did the rest of a monks lifetime, 1 damage for every 5 levels gained. This allows those unable to obtain the Epic Gloves to use the weapons they were born with and deal damage more in line with what monks are supposed to.<P>5) Give FISTS an offhand damage bonus equal to that of the primary fist. This should not apply to any weapon ever. It can apply to all classes however and not be construed as an improvement to any of the other classes, because it would not improve their damage under any normal circumstance. This would increase fist viability relative to weapons in current existance as well as close the gap between a monk and a rogue.<P>I believe if those 5 issues are addressed, the damage of a monk will be right on approximately half way between a warrior and a rogue.<P>The next item I want to address, is the viablity of monk Planar armor. I know this has been beaten with a stick for a long time, but i think it is a really important matter. In it's current state, monk planar armor, Shiverback Hide and Silver Moon, are often inferior to more readily attainable items not specifically monk only. The one thing that causes this is a defficency in AC. <P>Often, these items are left to rot in the bank because something bigger and better can be found elsewhere. Here is what i propse, increase the AC of all Monk Only planar armor to make it more competitive with the gear monks normally wear. I'm not saying to make it higher AC, just make it apporximate so we can actually use the items we work so hard to obtain. <P>The last topic i want to address is the ability of a monk to remain at the top of a MOBs agro list. In my experience, this usually only applies when I am pulling, but in some cases I can out taunt the main Tank. One of two things needs to happen, either Warriors, Paladins, Shadow Knights and other Tank classes need their taunt abilities improved or Monks need a skill that allows them to lower their taunt with a mob. I'm not sure which or how to implement this, but we do need a way to get lower on the agro list in a pinch.<P>We need an increase in damage, viable AC placed on our planar armor and a modification to allow us to stay lower on a MOBs agro list. I feel if these topics are addressed the Monk class will become balanced. <P>Axiss Glox<BR>54 Iksar Disciple<BR>Prexus Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have to say, the offhand damage increase would work quite well.  A full damage bonus like the primary hand would probably overpower monks as mentioned above (I think, using my number approximations).  If any kind of bonus could be implented, even delay-based (as posted above as well), it would add damage without really adding additional aggro like some form of haste, triple attack, double flycking kick, etc.<P>This would also be true for a new min damage on flying kick.<P>An alternative is a damage bonus, delay-based, given to all weapons (or just primary hand if dual wielding perhaps?).  This would mean the monks using 2hb wouldn't be left out.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I like the chained special attacks idea. You can use something like the Instill doubt animation and make one big special attack combo that uses all the special attacks together.<P>Make bandages purchaseable in stacks. Also have more expensive forms of bandages with scaled weight so that a higher level monk can carry more of them by purchasing more expensive bandages. Either that or a new type of spirit pouch that does not dissappear upon linkdeath. Losing a couple stacks of bandages at lower levels is one thing. Losing several bags full of them because you lost your connection is ridiculous.<P>Make high level fists just as viable as using a weapon - minus the procs and stat enhancements.<P>Scale the weight limit so that it increases as you get higher in level. It should go much higher than 14. This makes sense given EQ's economy and the monk's dependance on equipment. <P>Feigning should wipe or at least decrease aggro.<P>Improve monk utility skills to retain usefullness at higher levels. Most monk skills have a very short usefulness life span. For example Instill Doubt is very hard to learn at first and is resisted way too easily at higher levels. Its like being a spellcaster and most of your older spells becoming obsolete. Except that monks dont get as many new skills as a caster gets spells leaving the monk with fewer useful abilities in the end. <BR> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've never played a monk, but this is my oppinion on what role they should fulfill in the game.<P>I think that when you are going to balance monks, you should mainly balance them compared to warriors, since this is the class that resembles monks the most. I'm not saying that monks shouldn't be balanced compared to other classes, but they basically fulfill the same role as warriors (tanks, taunt, no spells) plus the role their FD gives them in group.<P>First of all (IMHO):<BR>1a) A monk should not be able to beat a warrior in toe-to-toe duel.<BR>Tanking is all the warrior does, while the monks have the advantage of FD.<BR>1b) A monk should outdamage a warrior by 20-30% (against the same opponent, given the same buffs, equipment of equal 'value' and obtainability etc.)<BR>2a) A monk should be able to beat a rogue in a toe-to-toe duel.<BR>A rogue should do slightly less damage than a warrior when standing in front of the enemy, but a whole lot more when standing behind, plus a monk should be a better tank than a rogue - Obviously since rogues have evade and monks have taunt.<BR>2b) A monk should NOT be able to outdamage a rogue who is standing behind the mob.<BR>Though they should still outdamage the warrior next to them by 20-30% (see above).<P>Feign Death: Great skill and the main reason why monks should not be equal to warriors in a toe-to-toe.<BR>But there does seem to be a problem. Feign Death is supposed to be a life saver, yet it appears the less hps the monk has, the more likely he/she is to fail feign death - which becomes even more obvious if the mob is frenzy on him and even more more obvious since Velious where feign death results in huge agro (I've heard).<BR>This means that FD can only be used for tag pulling/CR, which it is not meant for. FD should work better when the monk is already dying (also from a realism point of view).<P>As for offensive skills, I believe there was once a test of monk vs. warrior offensive skills. It is time to do another one, only this time compare all weapons available. Dual wield, 2-handers, Velious, Kunark, VP, bare hands - you name it! You don't have to publish the results (as this would be spoiler information) just use the results when balancing offensive skills.<BR>From what I've seen of Velious monk/warrior weapons, the monks have yet to find the top 50% of their weapons if they are ever going to outdamage warriors. In the name of balance this is IMO a very important issue.<BR>If the monk lacks the offensive skills to outdamage a warrior by the necesarry percentage here are some ideas on how to improve their perfomance:<P>1) Tripple attack for monks.<BR>Monks used to have higher double attack than warriors. Then warriors caught up on monks DA skill AND moved into TA. It would only be realistic if the monks would get this skill as well.<BR>2) Minimum damage on flying kick.<BR>Equal to half the monks level, this would make the minimum damage on Thunderkick equal to the monks level, as is the rogues BS only this requires a discipline. The minimum damage on Thunderkick is very depressing for high-level monks...<BR>3) Different timers on special attacks.<BR>Only with slightly longer recycle times for each one. This would make a monk fighting a sight to behold.<BR>Instead of punch punch punch punch FK punch punch punch FK,<BR>he/she would go punch DP punch punch punch ES punch punch FK or something like that<P>As for defensive skills I think you should do a test of monks compared to rogues similar to the offensive test (i.e. same buffs, armour of same 'value' and obtainability etc.). The result should be that monks tank better than rogues but worse than warriors - but not incredibly much worse than warriors.<BR>If monks are found to lack the necesarry tank skills, here are a few suggestions:<BR>Hitpoints: Are fine. Monks don't have warrior hitpoints, nor should they.<BR>Damage absorb AC (if there is such a thing): Is fine. They're in leather armour, for Christ's sake, they should have the damage absorbation of a plate wearing class. Monk armour items are working as intended (see below though).<BR>Voidance AC: Need to be improved slightly. Monks may not be plate wearers, but I think they seriously lack in AC, this would be nice little boost for them.<BR>Defensive skills: Consider giving the monk the parry-skill AS WELL AS block, thus making him/her harder to hit and again more Kung Fu-ish. Perhaps it should cap lower than warriors though, not to overpower monks. Also consider raising the Defense cap for monks (see Voidance AC).<P>Safefall: Nice, but not really a class balance issue. Working fine.<P>Weight restriction: Was very fair when monks where the "masters of melee damage", but this is an annoying feature and there should be something powerful in the other end to balance it with - so to speak. Note that I am NOT suggesting that the Weight restriction is removed, only that you take it into consideration when balancing the offensive skills of the various classes.

</FONT><HR>I'll try to make this as brief as possible.  The main problem with monks as I see it is armor.  When Temple of Sol came out everyone got a full set of class-specific armor, except monks who got crescent armor months later.  Then when Kunark came out everyone but monks got spell-effect armor, except monks who finally got it when Velious came out.  Shiverback has been a joke since it came out, and has not been fixed yet.  Here are my suggestions:<P>More quest armor.  Pretty please.<P>Shiverback:  When a monk finally reaches the level where he can travel among the planes, and he is lucky enough to survive, and get a rare piece of shiverback to drop, and win the random, it would be nice if that armor were actually something he would WANT to wear.  For example, the shiverback bracer is inferior to a bracer of erolisi, which you can buy for about 10pp.  That is just wrong.  So here's how to fix it:<P>1.  A minor spell effect.  Summon bandages/food/water, maybe a damage shield.  Nothing crazy, just something to make it a bit more usefull.<BR>2.  Higher resist buffs.  Add +10 to each pieces' resist (+17 Fire on legs instead of +7) and you have some wearable armor.<BR>3.  Negative weight.  This would allow us to either wield weapons or wear other heavier pieces without penalty.<BR>4.  Different model.  People would wear it just for prestige like other classes do if it didnt look like a newbie tunic.  Really, I go to the planes and get an ultra-rare planar tunic, and I look like Im first level??<P>You'll notice I didn't suggest AC boost.  While it would be nice, monks AC shouldnt be as high as warriors.  I think our AC is fine, but I would like our planar armor to be wearable.  Ask yourself this question:  why do you NEVER see a monk in full planar??<P>This last bit is probably more than you're asking for, but it's a great idea anyway:  make monks NOT NEED ARMOR!!!  This is I'm sure what your idea for monks was in the first place.  Here;s how you do it:<P>Monks now have block, dodge, and riposte.  Give us double and maybe triple block, dodge and riposte.  So it checks twice or three times for each ability.  Make it a quest if you want.  Actually doesn't that make more sense?  You do a quest and then go to a trainer and learn a new skill.  Isn't that more monk-like??  Then we wont have these armor conversations.  You won't hear "shiverback sucks" anymore.  Some kick-ass armor will drop and the monk in the group will say "I don't need armor, I'm a monk."<P>Bindu Nonbeliever<BR>Order of the Lost Circle<BR>Order of the Charred Heart<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>One thing you need to bear in mind: Many "old school" monks (those who played from release to before Kunark) are extremely disatisfied with the change of our role in Everquest.<P>Before Kunark, we were a highly valuable and needed class.  We did excellent damage, and we were -the- pullers...big raids just didnt happen without a skilled monk.<P>However, with the advent of Kunark and Velious, the monk's role has been over-shadowed by other classes, and in such we arent important anymore.<P>If a class doesnt feel they're important, especially on large raids, then there is a problem.<P>Anyways, down to issues:<P>Feign Death: This needs to be fixed in Velious especially.  Mobs cant be feign pulled, however other classes such as rogues, shadowknights, enchanters, and shamans have abilities that allow them to pull singles much more easily than a monk.  You've given our job to other classes. You hastily responded to the rogue complaint of caster classes being able to open locked doors by casting an eye of zomm, aggroing a mob, then having the mob open the door because it belittled pick lock.  Well, monks feel the same way about this turn of events.  Make us -the- pullers again.<BR>And Ironically enough, your vision of having feign death act as a "save yourself skill" doesnt work well in Velious either.  Far too many mobs totally ignore a feign death and proceed to slay you as you wait for a recharge, which itself seldom works if you happen to get it back in time.  With mobs like Velkator, Yelinak, or the Dain a monk is slain where a warrior or rogue could survive (through the large hp of a war or the evade of a rogue).<P>Damage Avoidance: You dont want us to have AC, because by virtue you want a monk to not get hit because he's agile.  However, our riposte/block/dodge skills are barely any higher than a rogue or warrior's similar evasion skills, and in such we gain no avoidance bonus.  One idea, which I liked, was if a monk stops attacking, his ability to roll a successful riposte/block/dodge increases 2 to 3 times.  This is perfectly balanced in that the monk is no longer dealing damage (save the riposte), but is able to avoid damage at a much higher level of success.<P>Mend: Let it increase to 210 skill...at level 50+ add the ability for mend to clear poison/disease from the monk's body<P>Flying Kick: Add a minimum damage.  The suggested fix is level/2.<P>Thunderkick: Change the discipline to a set period of time where all flying kicks have "enhanced" damage.<P>100hands: This discipline is seldom used because of the negligible damage gained over inner flame, yet the same reuse time.  Increase the time this discipline is active.<P>silent fist: This ability is seldom used because a) the dragon punch rarely does more damage than a regular dragon punch b) the stun just interupts a lower caster.  If the ability cast a spell similar to the silence spell used by Tunare, it would be much more desirable.  Increase the reuse time to match the ability.<P>ashen hand: 72 minutes recharge, it cant instakill mobs that a rogue can (lvl 34 vs. lvl 45 for a rogue), and the damage is negligible on a non-death touch (between 200-450 damage, while impressive, a discipline like innerflame is much more efficient and gives more overall damage during a fight).  Increase the non-death touch damage and raise the level cap on the death touch.<P>Off-hand hand to hand bonus: Nuff said.  Apply an off-hand damage bonus when using hand to hand.  This increases the viability of the monk fighting barefisted at any level.<P>Quests: Most monk quests, with exception to the robes and iksar shackle quests, are rather useless.  Add more useful content in this regard.<P>CF "stacking": Fix the "nerf" where the Celestial Tranquility effect can no longer "stack" with haste spells.  Either let the faster haste remain and the monk gains the atk/ac bonus when he uses the effect OR have the CF effect over-write ALL haste spells.  There's nothing more annoying than a friendly enchanter sticking augment on me and removing my ability to give myself atk/ac until the buff wears off.<P>That's all I have to say on that ;p<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok, this is a good opportunity to air out some issues that not only beat the dead horse, but flay the skin right from its bones!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif"><P>I love my monk, pure and simple, but from lvl 1 on up to the current lvl (he is 42) there are some things that really irritate me.<P>1.)  Headband/Sash quests.  They are useless.  The amount of trouble gone through to acquire such items is, at best, incredibly stupid.  What individual in his right mind would do these quests, other than the fact that they can then say they did them?  In fact, I think alot of low-mid monk item quests are wastes of time/effort.  Why take the time to do a quest which is, in itself, a FA-type quest, time-wise, with the minimal benefits they give?  These need serious looking into.<P>2.)  Lack of low to mid level weapons for monks.  All classes have them.  Now that monks are getting weapons in the high-end game, make some weapons of low weight/damage/dly available to young monks to build their skills.  I remember when ROK came out, finding out that my monk, 35 at the time, (yeah, I level slow!   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/biggrin.gif">) would have to start training in all weapon categories.  SIDEBAR:  Thank you for upping the HtH cap, its a step in the right direction!<P>3.)  Make ID usable.  It isn't.  At least it never works for me.<P>4.)  Flying Kick damage.  I hate seeing 3 points of damage on this otherwise great attack.  Too often it doesn't even stack up to the damage done by my fists, and it is irritating.<P>5.)  Missing.  Can you tell my why someone who trains his body to be a weapon can't hit squat?  I remember not too long ago fighting drolvargs and getting a whopping total of 26 total points of damage on him.  That is not a lie.  Ther rest of my attack whistled harmlessly by his head.<P>You try to punch a drolvarg rager, but miss!<BR>You try to punch a drolvarg rager, but miss!<BR>You try to punch a drolvarg rager, but miss!<BR>You try to punch a drolvarg rager, but miss!<P>Its great we have an innate haste, but, it often times is hampered by constant missing.<P>Quad misses suck.<P>Instead of upping the haste amounts, at least give us enhanced accuracy on our hits.  Frustrating is hardly the word.<P>6.)  Lack of variety in a monk's looks.  Thanks for the purple caster's robe.  Wonderful.  Great.  I don't know whether to kick your teeth in or cast a magic missile!  C'mon!  You know how long we have been asking for something that looks a LITTLE cool?<P>7.)  I thought monks were supposed to have good natural AC?  Mine doesn't, and I have some decent stuff.  I can't dodge like a guy in a full suit of plate armor, and that is a little strange.<P>Some things I think would be great:<P>Give Flying Kick a Minimum Damage and a stun after 35 or 40 or so.<P>Give us Triple Attack.  Without a doubt, this is the most rediculous thing ever.  A warrior swinging a sword has the opporunity to hit one more time that a guy using his fists or a light-weight stick?  GIVE ME A BREAK.<P>Enhance fist damage.<P>I have seen this suggestion a few times and it is a cool one:  Chain attacks together, like Flying Kick, then to Tiger Claw, Dragon Punch, so on and so forth, so that we can use those other special attacks for something other than useless disciplines later on in life!<P>Stop this anti-FD pulling campaign.  Why do you guys consider it cheating EVERY time someone comes up with a useful way of dealing with spawns.  (I agree some of these dealings are less than honorable, but, really, is Feign Death really that bad?  It seriously gives a monk a place in this world!)<P>Absor, I commend you.  Whether you are Abashi under a different name, or really a different person, you seem to be legitimately trying, and that is refreshing.  This undertaking of asking people about their classes is great and I never would have imagined Abashi doing something like this!<P>Keep up the good work and thanks for hearing (reading) me out!<P>As for the monk community; Guys, I'm sorry if some of these gripes aren't great, but, its just how I feel!  I only mean it for the best!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I was hoping to see Bodi's post a bit earlier on than it appeared I think it was a clear and consise discussion from the monk community, that we spent a lot of time working on and refining.<P>Things that were discussed that didn't quite make it due to early start of discussion.  <P>If a monk's role is to be the heavy hitter that "the vision" says we are suposed to be, please review how this is done, only the ultra rare 10 on the server weapons actually achieve the goal of outdamaging warriors, and rogues devestate us on damage, even without backstab they do equal damage.  Someone suggested giving monks an off hand damage bonus, and to me that seems like the most likely way of actually putting us back in the running for being in the spot you said we are suposed to have.<P>Defensively, we used to be able to tank stuff pre-kunark, the only reason for this was our skill caps, dodge, riposite and block.  Please increase these caps as they have room for improvement and perhaps if they were improved we could stand out in front of the mob like we used to be able to do. Also the reason we never had parry was because we weren't suposed to use weapons, since kunark we are suposed to use weapons, why not give us parry. None of this will help our ability to take the 700 damage hits, it will only allow us to stay in the vertical position longer.<P>Aggro mitigation.  Some people have made some good suggestions, like adding a psudo evade to feign death, or making feign death work to save our lives again.  It boils down to until monks can get rid of agro by doing anything instead of sitting out of the fight or laying out of the fight it will leave monks as being useless and unwanted in groups and unbalanced.  If i'm dead or not attacking any class is outdamaging me and i might as well not be there.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>In general:<BR>1) I love playing my monk. I played other classes and they do not compare with the fun I have playing my monk.<P>2) I completely agree with Zadkiels/Bodikibachi's post. Even thought I have absolutely no experience at those levels of game-play those requests seem to be reasonable and balanced.<P>While there are going to be many more posts concerning the Uber levels I want to throw my 2pp in here about the rest of us (I'm level 25).<P>In order of importance:<P>1) The ability to interrupt casters with our special attacks. I do not care if you use stun or not. At the moment I do not even try to attack green con casters. I tried a couple of times and died horribly. If you decide to implement the ability to interrupt casters post 50 and via stun, my feelings are to not waste your time coding it. From what I have read MoBs 56+ resist stun. So do not bother, there are better ways to spend your developer's time.<P>2a) A coin weight reduction bag. Now you are going to point to the Dakoit Coin Purse. I do not believe they really exist. I have NEVER seen Dakoit (and I play an Iksar I've spent 15 levels in the Field of Bone) and I have never seen a purse. Also, 10% is really not all that helpful. Make it Monk Only. Monks are caught in a Catch 22, the weight reduction bags are very expensive and we have to drop coin all the time to stay under weight (can't raise the cash to buy a bag that will allow us to raise the cash).<P>2b) /nocoin plat|gold|silver|copper. If you are not going to give us a coin weight reduction bag PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE give us the ability to NOT loot coins that we will immediately drop/destory (both in a group and solo). Most monks do not care if you do not change the group loot formula, just make it so that our share never makes it into our inventory.<P>3) Either a message when our FD was successful and we are not going to get beat on  or one that the MoB has seen thru it and will continue to pound us. Spells should not break FD. I have read in these posts that feign pulling is not part of Verant's design. ummmm sorry did not get that memo. Of course, I have only been playing since Aug 00 and it seems to very much be a part of the game. Also fix the bug that it the char is frozen for a second or two after standing from an FD. This has lead to MANY deaths.<P>4a) Damage vs Defense. Again this is from a not-even-close-to-Uber monk. I would MUCH prefer if you increased the defense skills so that we are hit much less (even make it completely dependant on being under 14 weight). I'm not asking for more AC, just make dodge/parry/ripost/block more effective (a master of martial arts not only master offense but defense). <P>4b) Increase the taunt of the other classes. I have yet to NOT be the tank in a group, even with a warrior in the group.<P>5) Instill Doubt. Why did you bother? Make it actually useful.<P><BR>Christmas Wish List:<P>1) Complete the Iksar Whistling Fist quest.<BR>2) Lighter Equipment (armor and weapons).<P><BR>Kurrlee<BR>Monk of 25 Ales<BR>E'Ci<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hmm, alright no Ninja/AD&D/CrouchingTiger abilities...we're not looking to redefine the class, or add extra roles...just to crystallize our current role.<P>What I'd like to see:<P>A modest increase in damage.  The most exciting way to do this would be the 'chained specials' idea that has been mentioned.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  With Flying kick having a chance to trigger a dragon punch, that having another chance to trigger eagle strike, and yet another chance to trigger tiger claw, etc.  The sum total of the extra damage would probably not equal the amount of two flying kicks, but it would be fun to watch and would add tons of flavour to the class.  But once again, there are coding difficulties to this...take up the challenge, Verant.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  This would be a good way to increase the damage without A)Adding more uber weapons to the database or B)Messing with the monk fist damage/ratios.<P>A better way to mitigate damage.  Feign does not work past 35...I'm not sure what to ask for here.  I'd love the evade skill, as it is frankly...awesome.  But that would be borrowing from the rogues and I don't want that.  Asking for Feign to return to the 'complete aggro wipe' of the old days isn't acceptable either.<P>I don't think this problem could be handled without adding some sort of new skill..perhaps something called 'Tumble' which allows the monk to use acrobatics to back out of the combat...working similar to evade but nowhere near as reliable.<P>Thunder Kick - embarrassing to use.  Improve it slightly, this is hardly worthy as a 2nd discipline.<P>Better spread of weapons selection.  Monks carry Fighting Batons until level 40 and from there they go to Wu Sticks, and then to JadeMaces/CFs.  Since after Kunark we were sort of redefined as a weapon-using class, give us more weapons.<P>Monkly fashion...armor and equipment choices are extraordinarily poor.  Despite other's claims of weight limits and equipment limits adding 'flavour' to the monk class, I feel it adds more boredom than flavour.  Increase the weight limit slightly, and at an earlier level that 55.  This would probably slightly boost the monk ac, which I think is due...and also add some variety to the appearances of monks as we have now expanded the range of 'light enough to wear' equipment.<P>My 2cp,<BR>Kaidain</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The two skills are virtually identical except WW can hurt them :P<P>Thunderkick = Monk ego competition, this discipline is one of those bank ones, i got it, nice ok i got another discipline.. byebye.<P>Stonestance is undoubtedly one of the best, with whirlwind and innerflame being up there (for ubers etc). (Stonestance should last a bit longer, maybe 15-20 seconds or even more)<P>Thunderkick should actually be done away with.. why not treat a thunderkick as a monk crit? It does an almost exact replica of the "scores a critical hit" so use it as such.<P>Why also does kick miss so much? at 212 skill i consistenly miss 3-4 in a row before finally landing one.<P>silliness for sure.

I personally feel that they have narrowed it down greatly to what we need and want as Monks, and I feel that anything else that might be posted here would be just be repeating similar thoughts. <BR> <BR>Again, hats off to Bodi and Zad for their lengthly post regarding changes to Monks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>A few things.<P>I disagree with changing the weight constraints based on level. I would rather see it as something that we have control over. When starting out at level 1 (for humans)we have 80 str, 80 sta, 85 dex, 85 agi and 20 bonus points to spend. If you add those up you get 350 points. Taking our weight limit of 14 pounds we can generate a percentage that refelcts our attributes in our weight limit. For 350 points it becomes 4%.<P>I am level 53 and currently have 132 str, 89 sta, 132 dex, and 122 agi. At 4% this would equate to a weight limit of roughly 19 stones. This clearly shows that by having higher stats we are more agile, dexterous, stronger, and have more endurance to fight with heavier gear.<P>The second request that I would like to see is allow any vendor to coin up for you. I can't tell you how many times I have gone to a store and turned pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters into dollars. I was never limited to doing this at a bank. Heh, I would even like to add Velium currency so that 10pp=1vp.<P>I agree strongly with raising our dodge/block/riposte caps to 252 and help reinforce that we are not tanks. However, I would give us the skill parry as well. I would have it capped at 252. The trick here, is that we use weapons now. The other classes got parry since they used weapons. This skill would only be active when weilding weapons and would help offset the PENALTY we alone as monks face when using weapons due to there weight.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I play a  monk I have leveled all the way to 60, and the only real concern I have with the class is DAMAGE !!  Pre- Kunark the class was well balaced and did what it should.  Now, we are on equal footing with warriors offensively and still vastly inferior in tanking.  <P>Monks and Warriors have a damage output that is with in 5% of each other, all other things being equal.  That needs to improve DRAMATICALLY.<P>In general a equally equiped monk should do AT LEAST 35% to 45% more damage than a warrior.  Monks should be able to do about 75% to 85% of the damage a rogue can do from the back of a mob.  Monks are a melee damage based class, and our damage output should be on par with that.<P>SUGGESTIONS to improve monks:<BR>1.  INCREASE MONK ATK. From level 51 to 60 give monks an automatic 15pt ATK bonus per level.  So at level 60 a monk would have an attack 150pts higher than before.  This would help improve damage output for all monks regardless of their weapon choice.  Pre-Kunark monks already did have this advantage as our offense skill caped well higher than any other class including rogues and warriors.  With Kunark, all classes had skill caps increased, (warriors and rogues cap within 2 pts of us offensively and defensively now).  Obviously we got the short end of this balance.<P>2. IMPROVE FIST DAMAGE.  (Including celestial fists).  Pre-Kunark a monks fist damage increased every 5 levels from 4 to 14 (level 50 monk had 14 damage fist).  Fist delay fell from 36 at low levels to 30 at level 50.  A level 60 monk STILL has a 14 damage fist.  Fist delay at 50 is 30, and at 60 is 26.  Clearly   monks fist damage isnt keeping up in terms of the natural progression. I would suggest 18/24 (for human at least) as a good target for level 60 monk fists.  Of course the celestial fists (9/16 now) would need improvment also then.<P>3.  WEAPON WEIGHTS.  The Tranquil Staff is wt 10.0.  Many other kunark monk 2hb's are the same wt.  These weapons were added most likely with out changing the wt. from a generic 2hb weapon template by a designer who didn't have full knowledge of the game.  Being that a level 50 monk has a wt. limit of 14, it is rediculus to ask him to devote over two-thirds of his carrying capacity to a tranquil staff or other overly heavy 2hb weapon.  Clearly these weapon wt.'s are bugged, and they need to be fixed asap.  Forcing a monk to choose between weilding a tranquil staff in order to do the damage he should as a monk, or  carrying extra food and water is a little overboard.<P>4. FEIGN DEATH.  The FD skill was designed to save a monk from death.  In the level 50 to 60 game it doesnt really work like this anymore.  In kunark to an extent, and almost always in Velious, if you try to FD on a mob after you have inflicted some amount of damage on it, the mobs "sees through it" and continues to pummel you sensless.  Hence, in a fight gone bad, or when a mob is "too mad at you" FD is generally useless. <P>Another issue here that was likely a bug but is now played off as a "design feature" is not being able to FD on casting mobs.  If you FD on a mob AFTER it starts to cast a spell on you, but before it hits you, when the spell hits you your succesful feign breaks.  Thus it is impossible to save your self from chain casting mobs or multiple casting mobs with FD.  I dont think FD was just supposed to work against melee mobs, I think this is just a bug where a spell hitting you after you FD breaks FD for some "buggy " reason.  Fix this and you will make a lot of monks happy. <P>5. GRAPHIC FOR CELESTIAL FISTS.  The gloves have no "skin" coded for them and when worn show up as if you are not wearing any gloves at all.  If you turn particle effects to medium or higher (which most computers won't allow), you can see the stars coming out of the gloves, but the gloves them selves still have no graphic.  Im sure it wouldnt be to hard to code the celestial fists to have the apperance of shiverback gloves or something like that just for completeness of the visual effect.<P>SUMMARY:  Monks were a great class before kunark.  Increase our fist damage and general damage dealing capacity somehow to put it back to the same realative place as it was before and monks will be a great class again.<P>Thanks for your time and starting this helpful discussion.<BR>&lt;bow&gt;<BR>Jaef - Saryrn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I have three complaints about monks:<P>#1:  FD needs to work more (or have an upgrade to it) - It really sucks sometimes....  --  I also think that FD'ing should be treated as sitting (so you regenerate at your sitting rate (after all, lying is far more comfortable than squatting all the time...))  --  i've died too many times cuz I had to FD and then I was dotted to hell and the mob just stood there...     <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>#2:  A MINIMUM damage (especially on the special attack) - It's really annoying to see 5 attacks be successful, and then get a total of 5 pts of damage...  (granted, I haven't done 5 1's, but I have done 4 1's and a 3 ...)  --  That's embarrassing....<P>#3:  A chance for crits (or something) to keep us on track with Rogues...  --  I'm tired of not being able to find a group cuz they'd rather have a rogue instead of a monk ...<P><BR>As for improvements:<P>I'd like to see a weight limit change made:  (I think this is fairly balanced):  10 #'s at 1-9, 12 #'s at 10 - 19, etc, etc ...  (ie. 10 + 2 / 10 levels)     <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I'd also either like less damage taken from a hit (I'm really tired of being tagged for 80 pts of damage, and the twinked warrior next to me gets hit for 20 each time...)  --  Or better armor available to monks to absorb damage....<P>Finally, I'd REALLY like to see a self only SoW, or some type of speed enchancement - If monks are master pullers, then make us not have to rely on a sower to pull...  After all, if you have a warrior with a sow, who needs a monk ....<P><BR>Draggyn Slayyer<BR>32nd Iksar Monk<BR>Cazic-Thule / Children of Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>More damage is pointless if we can't use it.  Right now at level 56 if I don't turn off attack for 50% of the fight, I die immediately versus the large MoBs -- named dragons, dain, velkator, etc..  Rogues and warriors are quite valuable on raids.  Monks are unwanted for this very reason -- they just add to CR and if they live, it's because they kept their damage output to something less than a warrior.<P>Why bring a monk when even a warrior will do more damage?  Some of the lower level monks may not realize this, but what a monk does on the higher level fights is nothing -- just drag corpses out.  The monk damage output is such a large taunt and the hp/ac is so low that monks mostly can't be used on these fights.<P>The stated role of a monk is high damage output.   IMHO, it's absolutely critical that monks have a method to contribute this primary ability to these battles.  There are 3 ways to fix this: drastic AC/HP upgrade, large skill boost to dodge/block/etc, or an evade skill equivalent to rogues.  Since the first two would essentially eliminate the need for warriors, evade is the way to go.  With evade, we'd still need all the other classes to do what they're doing now, we'd just be able to do our thing, too -- frontal damage.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
