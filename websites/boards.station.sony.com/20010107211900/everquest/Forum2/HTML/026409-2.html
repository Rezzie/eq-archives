</FONT><HR>FYI Powerleveling is in character.  That's the same as training.  When a hunter needs to learn how to hunt, have an experienced hunter take him hunting and let him do everything with the watchfull eye of the superior, skilled player on him, keeping him free from danger and the like.  It works in real life, why not in game?  <P>In my opinion I really dont want this switch because for fear that I may accidentally get it set to on.  XP is precious and there would never be a situation that I would want to give it up.  Powerleveling is the solution to this problem if you're against the suicide approach.<P>I'd just have to vote that it not even be implemented.  A bug could easily get this set to on by accident.  It's simply a bad idea when there are too many ways in game for the same ends to be achieved.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I think this toggle needs to be looked at and the following needs to be considered:<BR>1. Characters will be able to stop there experience gain at a specific level in order to maintain an advantage.<BR>a. Now they will be able to max all their skills before reaching the next level, and be in a better position to win duels or player events for that level range.<BR>b. On the Red servers, they can stop themselves when they reach a level at which they can have an advantage killing other players.<BR>c. People that camp items for sale on the internet can now continue to camp those items forever because they will always be the appropriate level for the spawn.<BR>d. Dragon raids will always have the same people on them. Those people will never advance on purpose, in order to continously kill the dragon to sell those items.<BR>e. Now people will be able to max their skills and twink their lower level character, until that character is all powerful for its level.<P><BR>There are a lot more disadvantages than this, and the amout of people complaining about out leveling their friends, I would suggest they create an alternative character to play when thier group is not online, or simply get killed next to their bind point.<P>You can use the rational that as a roleplayer it is against your nature to suicide, but then again what are you doing running around getting experience and not growing and developing? And why are you adventuring without your friends? What are they on a Norrathian vaction or something?<P>Thanks<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Wow I like this idea.<P>Its so simple to implement actually, so long as ALL the current EXP rules are kept in place as Absor said (nothing redistributed etc..) All they have to do is find the routine which gives exp to a player, call it variable X where X is added to "CurrentEXPTotal" each kill and put in a check of something like:<BR>  IF ExpToggle = false '; exp turned off<BR>      then<BR>    X = 0<BR>   end if..<P>then the normal X + currentexp calculation.<P>Nothing real radical here.  A simple 10 minute fix for whomever is doing the calculation programming, mabye another 10 for somone to put in the toggle somewhere (either visually or command line would be fine).  <P>Another step would them be a ssimular check for the "You have gained EXP" message and if the flag is turned on you get something like "You have declined to gain EXP".<P>The ONLY problem which would occur of all this that I forsee, is complaints.. some people will forget that though you turned OFF your gain, your LOSS is still and alwasy be turned on.  Therefore should you die, you WILL lose experience (as it should be) and until you turn on your flag you won't gain any exp.  <P>Don't even try to ask if the exp can be 'saved' up for deaths.. it'll never happen  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Good idea guys..this should be a snap to implement.<P>Meraxes Glibilskym<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>""It seems open to lots of game abuses. The first that comes to mind, is enabling this before you level past the dragon raid levels, and then keeping experience off until you have had your fill of fighting dragons and reaping the goodies in the dragon lairs. (Whether there should be level limits is another issue). ""<P> That isn't an abuse however.  The lvl limit on dragons is to prevent uber high level characters from doing tthe dragons like a milk run.  If they are still under lvl 53, whether by the toggle or repeated suicides, it is not an abuse.  The characters are STILL under lvl 53, with the same cap on abilities and power. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Syber - all of the issues you present can be handled by dying.  <P>- People delevel themselves on the PvP servers in order to have a huge advantage over the players they kill.  To me, that's much worse than turning off exp to stay in a certain range.<P>- As has already been mentioned, people suicide to stay within the level limits on dragons, or get paid to become a few essence emeralds for a necro.  Besides, hasn't the loot table for Naggy and Vox been copied to the dragons in Kunark?<P>- Most farmers, by nature, wait until they're so high that they can camp the spawn by themselves. (or at least to the point where the spawn is relatively easy, ie not blue.)  That, and anybody has a right to the spawn, whether it's green to them or red to them.<P>And while it's been suggested that keeping in the same level range as the people you hunt with by dying... I suppose it's a personal issue there.  I'd rather not gain then force myelf to lose.  Grouping with my friends is far more important than the exp I gain.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I realy dont see how this feature is neccisary.   I'd rather see verant devote their resources to more important features.   There is good cause for wanting this, however, there is already good ways to acheive this effect without rewriting core programing.   <P>If you out experience your friends, just walk up to your nearest friendly neighborhood Priest of Discord, preferably one near your bind point, and hit your attack button... istant Xp recalibration.   Better yet, if you are 46+, seek our your friendly neighborhood 51+ Necromancer and offer your services as a Sacrificial offering.   You can either make major brownie points wiht the necro by allowing him to keep the resulting essence emerald, money off the necro by 'selling' your sacrificial complience, or a essence emerald that could later be redeemed for rezurections from a 54+ necro later in your career this way.<P>Loosing Xp is so easy there is realy no need for a XPOFF switch... please dont detract verants attention from issues that are not so easily circumvented.<P>The Necromancer sacrifice trick is a great way to become filthy rich while hovering yourself in the Dragon-availability xp range.<P>Speaking as a Necromancer, I'd much rather people with these concerns spin their unwanted XP into essence emeralds rather then tossing it down the drain with an XPOFF switch.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I look at a lot of posts, many of which seem to merit a response of some kind and get none.  Now this rather trivial issue which players can already fix themselves comes up and gets this level of attention from you?!<P>BTW, there was a guide on last night my time...not that guides have authority to do anything, just so you know.<P>Lzoril</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well, first off I dont understand the problem auf getting too much exp. If I want to stay on my actual level I just had to die once a day and thats it. So every time I gain a bub of experience I die and loose it again. Where is the difference to not gaining experience at all? The result is the same.<P>And think about the interesting things you can do. For example put all your items and money in the bank an go visiting Vox just for fun. Ok, you will die there very fast, but think about the fun :-))<BR>There are a lot of suicide missions I can think about right now.  And past lvl 45 you will always find a necro who would like to take your soul and exp and even be willing to pay you.<P>As long as you get exp, adding it to your total exp or not, you still take a lot exp from the party making them level even slower, so they will need much more time to catch up with you. That doesnt sound like a good solution for me.<P><BR>One valid idea is to play alternate chars when you have more play time than your friends. So you got a regular group that only playes together and some other char when you play solo. Or you use the solo time for other, non exp things like trade skills, stupid camping quests or just nice roleplaying. Or go out and use the time to explore other zones or dungeons where you can go with your friends later.<P>There are so many ways to play this game. Outleveling your friends is only a problem if you decide to do so. I remember staying 3 weeks in level 35 just because I didnt want to level. I did so many other things this time. <P>As much things outleveling your friends is not a flaw of the world of everquest but just a flaw in the way you play it. If you want to get around this, you have lots of ways to do so.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>This is a very intriguing idea. I'm not sure if I like or not though. I have to admiot the ability to help peeps catch up is very attractive. Most of the problems I've seen named are easily solvable. I'll pick the post I think best summarizes the problems initially foreseen:<P>&lt;&lt;1. Characters will be able to stop there experience gain at a specific level in order to maintain an advantage.&gt;&gt;<P>A valid concern is undue advantage from this features. So what are the advantages?<P>&lt;&lt;a. Now they will be able to max all their skills before reaching the next level, and be in a better position to win duels or player events for that level range.&gt;&gt;<P>Good point. So turning off exp means also turning off any chance of  advancing current skill levels. That should solve that one.<P>&lt;&lt;b. On the Red servers, they can stop themselves when they reach a level at which they can have an advantage killing other players.&gt;&gt;<P>I've yet to play PvP, so I cannot address this issue.  Anyone else have any ideas?<P>&lt;&lt;c. People that camp items for sale on the internet can now continue to camp those items forever because they will always be the appropriate level for the spawn.&gt;&gt;<P>I don't see anyway around this one.  He has a good point.  <P>&lt;&lt;d. Dragon raids will always have the same people on them. Those people will never advance on purpose, in order to continously kill the dragon to sell those items.&gt;&gt;<P>Another good point I see no way around.<P>&lt;&lt;e. Now people will be able to max their skills and twink their lower level character, until that character is all powerful for its level.&gt;&gt;<P>Twinking has been, and always will be in EQ. To be honest, I don't think this will make it any easier or harder to do, nor do I think it wopuld seriously impact the level of twinking that occurs.<BR>Nonetheless, he has some good points about farming and the ever so sensitive topic of Dragon raids and level caps.<P>Just some observations on some goodpoints.  I stil think the idea has lots of positive potential.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/026409-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/026409.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=026409&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=026409&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
