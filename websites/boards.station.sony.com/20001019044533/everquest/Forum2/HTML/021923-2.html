</FONT><HR>various comments...<P>"VI is slowly turning into big brother."<BR>-- Awesome!  When do we get to vote to kick somebody out of "the house"?<P>"They are facist in the way they are delving into public places and banning people because they don't like whats there."<BR>-- My understanding is that someone directed them to the site... not that they are "delving".<P>"the less formal usage of the word may well include the forceful imposition of one's own ideas on others"<BR>-- Verant is NOT forcefully imposing their ideas on others.  Anyone who thinks they are should (IMO) take a basic computer class.  There is, after all, a way to uninstall software.<P>"If you ran a busines would you want someone to walk in toss $10 in you face and say "now Bend over B****!" I wouldn't. Customers have a responsibility to respect the company, just as the company should respect its customers. I've seen way to many fall back on $10 as an excuse for there right to say, do, and expect whatever they can dream up."<BR>-- You forgot to allow for the cheaters, though - it shouldn't have to be real money, to allow for them.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>"The recent banning of Mystere for that dumb story and the removal of the EQMacros site is just two big examples of what I'm talking about."<BR>-- Lemme see... an individual violates Intellectual Property in a way that Verant doesn't like, and Verant doesn't want to continue a business relationship with that individual. Right?<BR>-- I'm not familiar with the EQMacros thing - are you saying that Verant bought them out, and closed the site?  Or took them to court and forced the site to be closed?  Those are the most likely two ways I know of that Verant could have closed down the site.<P>"My problem with this whole thing is the lack of justice involved. For me, it would have been much more fair if  Verant/Sony's lawyers would descend upon her.....at least a court of law would decide if she was ACTUALLY guilty"<BR>-- Who should they waste the time and money?  Are they likely to have their court costs reimbursed if they win?  Doubtful. The other side of the argument, though, is entitled to file suit if they wish.<P>" : a tendency toward or actual exercise of strong autocratic or dictatorial control"<BR>It is possible to call Verant fascist without directly comparing Verant to Fascist Italy or Germany of the 1940s."<BR>-- Only in the same case that people here are fascists, because they are exercising autocratic control of their keyboards.  I have yet to see how Verant is influencing my non-EQ-related activities.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Abashi said, "That aspect means nothing if people are able to gain a competitive advantage through means not available to other players."<P><BR>So the answer would be not to ban these things then (by this logic) but make sure everyone were using them -- or at least could use them if they wanted to. <P>I can see the response to this already...and it reveals the true reason why these things are not tolerated -- Verant knows that if the game is not considerably time consuming, people will feel less happy about their accomplishments. The problem is people can also get bored more easily...so they put in tiny addicting qualities to the game which keep you coming back for more --each reinforces the other.<P>If they allowed people to use EQMacros and ShowEQ and other such things, people would be able to get what they want faster and circumvent the trap of addiction -- to some extent anyway -- thus leading to a shorter life time of their product. And that is a big no no.<P>the end<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Well, knowing when a spawn pops, or exactly where you are all the time, or automating keystrokes can easily be seen as cheating, and rightly so.<P>Of course, your point of Verant banning whatever makes EQ easier is not one to be taken lightly.<P>One example is seeing just how worthless the manual is in this game.<P>Can anyone imagine how much longer/time consuming, and how long it would take to figure out things like exp penalties, stats are mostly meaningless, if we did not have so many EQ websites with spell lists, maps, and other info?<P>This game would take 5x longer, yet when you got to level 50+ it would STILL be a disappointing experience.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>&gt; So it's a MMOG now.<P>Abashi's explained this a few times.  An MMOG is a multiplayer online game.  Soverign is an MMORTS.  Quake 3 can be considered an MMOFPS.  Everquest is an MMORPG.  They can all be lumped into the category of MMOGs.  Abashi's statements can really apply to any of the games mentioned above.<P>Tween Talonstrike<BR>25 warrior, Luclin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Knowing when a spawn pops is not cheating because it has never been declared so by Verant.  Gating into the zone and kill stealing it is cheating, again by Verant declaration.<P>Using computer capabilities outside the Verant-provided client is cheating, because Verant declared it to be cheating  'Botting' is a massive problem on any online roleplaying game that trades improved abilities for time spent killing things.  'Botting' is considered by many MUDs to be a reason for imprisonment or banning.<P>These are perfectly reasonable positions and the game environment provider necessarily must maintain the upper hand in setting rules.  (After all, if each and every player gets to decide the rules, then, by definition, there are NO rules...the person who has the authority to make rules...well....RULEZ!!!)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>OK I beleive EQMacros was closed down by a Cease and Disist order from Lawyers.  It was against the EULA and there against their rulles, and they have every right to do this.  The created the game, and want to protect the coding and the way the game works.  This is fine.<P>As for the story thing - I feel that they have explained their actions adaquatly and the writer has even said that he had a long conversation with Smedly.  So they have come to an agreement about the issue.  Also they even said that they only became aware of the writting when someone sent them a copy of the story, and stated that it was of consern to many Child Protection agencies.  This applied legal and other pressures to them to do something about it.  I feel they came down hard on the person, but were backed into an interesting Public relation cornor.  I do not envy them in that situation.<P>VI is not Big brother - they are not watching your PC while you are logged.  They are not policing the websites to hid information regarding the MOBs (ie HP,s and abilities).  They just do not share information, nor do they confirm or deny anything found or discovered.  Overall I feel they have run the game and business the best way they could.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>well, since some people like cheating and you say some want the game to be hard, why not have hard servers and easy servers or servers with cheats, kind of like how some people like to kill other players so you have PK servers and some people don't like getting killed by other players so you have normal servers, personally EQ barely holds my attention span, I get bored playing a druid, I keep making other characters because I hate waiting for the little bar to go up and I hate hunting in crowded areas and I hate sitting and waiting for my mana/health to go up or sitting with auto-attack, or clicking the same spells slots over and over in the same order, I would love to be level 60 in a few months only playing every once in a while, that is just my opinion, I'm sure some people find it fun to play for three months and still be level 40, and some people actually enjoy playing warriors</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
