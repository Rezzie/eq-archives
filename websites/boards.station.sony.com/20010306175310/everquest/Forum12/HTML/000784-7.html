</FONT><HR>As a 55 lvl wizard, I have to disagree with Alan. With lures, we give up efficiency so are spells can land. Well, Alan, I hate to disappoint you but these lures don't land on 55+ mobs. It's very depressing that we give up efficiency in the first but but then to see that the lures don't even land on mobs they were intended to damag. For example, casting a fire lure on a cold based mob, the mob does resist. Are they supposed to resist to begin with? We got a double wammy on lure, we give up efficiency with lure plus we have to put up with high resists too?? This makes the lure line unappealing.<P>Also, about wave spells in general. Everytime I use this line, the mob ALWAYS attacks me on the 2nd wave. This is not an opinion but a reality. I never seen a mob take a 3rd wave. Usually like 1/5  times I used this spell, I get 2 resists in a row and then the mob attacks me. I also get that 1 resist in there too. Efficiency on waves is good on paper but with the high resist rates on them plus the mob always attacks you on the 2nd wave, efficiency means nothing on this spell. You lose efficiency by never getting the 3rd wave and the resist, OMG, everyone is complaining about it, not just wizards.<P>In sum, please look into lures on resist and the 3rd wave problem/resist.<P>Pluto</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Thank you for checking back with us, Alan, we really appreciate your efforts.<P>"Ok, you’ve got a long list. Some of it I did cover, though. And I’m not gonna argue with you again about rains...<BR>I know, I know..."<P>OK just checking  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> your wording seemed kind of vague.  Incidentally I didn't see that an argument so much as a discussion trying to clarify some things, sorry if I came off belligerant or argumentative.  Its just an area of concern and passion after a long time of being blown off rudely and unpleasently by Abashi and being understood but put off by GZ until he wasn't THERE any more.<P><BR>"One item, not really a big deal, I would think. And maybe it was never intended to be as good as Tashan..."<P>The Staff of Temperate Flux was designed to help us with resistances.  However, because it reduces resistances by so LITTLE it has no real effect whatsoever on combat and Wizards just use it for other tricks like pulling.  Since Tashan is the least powerful resistance reduction spell in the game and it was not deemed too powerful at level 4, one would suspect an item that is around level 30 in quest level should do at least that much effect.  <P>Just trying to help the programmers out, they put a lot of work into this and its not being used for its job.  Kind of like working hours on a spoon and seeing everyone dial the phone with it because its lousy at spooning.<P>"I imagine that the reason that these things don’t go through buildings and such would be the same reason that they won’t go over hills."<P>That's possible, might also have something to do with the code that prevents people from jumping through zone lines, but I just was hoping you would keep this in mind in case it isn't  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>&gt;”-Something not mentioned about damage was speed.&lt;<P>"Maybe. But it’s not really unbalanced as it is. The fact that there are a few spells that cast fast really can’t be considered unbalancing. And this is also sort of covered in the Spell Efficiency thing. Doing a lot of damage in 6 seconds is still faster than doing less damage in 4 seconds..."<P>Well, here's the deal, Wizards have been told over and over they are about fast damage, that being outdamaged over time is no big deal because we do it fast and furious.  Blasting things in an emergency to stop runners or burn something down that must die NOW is the specialty of the class.<P>But our blasts get slower and slower and slower until they take an equivalent of a weapon delay of 63 at level 49 to cast.  Yes, the damage is big, but suddenly your intended use is trashed.  Quick kill it!  OK give me a while (cast cast cast).  Calefaction does a lot of damage VERY fast, isn't that what WIzards are supposed to be about?<P>And finally in balance terms, if there are other classes with faster damage than Wizards AND they offer long term damage.... do you see where I'm going here?<P>&gt;”-The post 34 alleged reduction in resistances Wizards are supposed to have innately was not mentioned.&lt;<P>"Never heard of this. I don’t even remember it being mentioned in the threads, or ever in all of my time with EverQuest, as a player or tester or employee. Are you sure this isn’t one of those famous EQ myths? I’ll add it to the list. I at least want to find out about it."<P>Absolutely sure its part of the game, without any hesitation whatsoever.  It was added in January of 2000 as I recall, and the reason you probably haven't heard of it is that even Wizards aren't sure its in there.  That's kinda why we'd like you to take a look into this if you could.<P>Here is how Abashi Described it in January of 2000:<P>The changes to Wizards mean that for any Wizard above Level 35 they get a lower chance of their Cold, Fire, or Magic spells being resisted. In reality their spells are basically given a built in "debuff" factor. This stacks with any other debuff, such as Tashania, Malosi or Temperate Flux and gives Wizards much better combat effectiveness. It is not a duration debuff. It does not mean when you cast a DD spell the mobs resistance is lowered for other casters in the group. What the tweak does is when a DD spell is cast it looks at the current resistance of the target, and then the new tweak reduces that resistance amount further, then uses that new reduced resistance within the game formula to determine if the spell lands, or is partially or fully resisted. This process is done each and every time you cast a spell which is enchanced by the new code. Wizards should now notice the following with these types of spells now:<BR>·Green Mobs: Rarely Resisted <BR>·Blue Mobs: Rarely Resisted <BR>·White Mobs: Much Lower Resistance <BR>·Yellow Mobs: Much Lower Resistance <BR>·Light Reds: You will now have a much better chance against these mobs. <BR>·Deep Reds: Regular Resistance, with a slight chance of the "debuff factor" assisting. <BR>This tweak for Wizards doesn't change the 6 level cap. <P>It simply makes general combat much easier for the Wizard Class. They should be able to use more powerful spells with less resists on mobs that would be resisted by most other members of the party. It should help to keep the Wizard the true masters of direct damage spells."<P>"Nope, no mention was made. I just happen to know that it IS intended to work as it does. It’s not supposed to allow you to scout into dangerous places, that’s why it aggros things."<P>I'm curious what it was meant for then, because it looks like it was meant for a scouting tool, and if it won't let you see what you can't see safely already what use is it other than a party favor?  I can use bind sight to hop all over a dangerous area with no aggro in any way, and it lasts forever without range.  Why does Eye of ZOmm represent a game breaking issue?<P>Further, this is kind of a balance issue in terms of Wizard Group friendliness.  It would give the WIzard and Magician (although he's much less likely to use it) something unique to bring to the group, letting them peek at things and go "Ok guys, there are 3 Goombahs around the corner."  And lastly, since the tinkered eye follows the same code it would help tinkering.  Please do reconsider this, the concept makes no sense to have a scouting tool that is useless for scouting.<P>"Ok. Is it only with Bonds? He basically stated that it was ALL rain and snare spells, and that didn’t sound right. I’ll add it to my notes on Bonds."<P>I'm unaware of any problems with AE Rain spells in this but it's possible, can't hurt to look into it I suppose.<P>"For less resistance, you get less efficiency. That’s how it works, and it makes sense. You don’t really need those spells at lower levels, do you? You get them when the resistances get high."<P>Actually ask the guys in charge of creatures how many new creatures were added into Velious with very high resistances under level 52.  The EXG in Solusek A already is immune to magic and its like level 30.  Its more useful than you'd think, although not as pressing as level 50+.  An option of course would be to code this so the 6+/1.2x resistance increase wouldn't take effect on lure spells - thats a way of letting Wizards contribute in emergencies they are totally shut out of now (something that comes up a lot in the 20s).<P>"Because the can affect the target more easily, they are more efficient than other spells that will be more resisted (or always resisted)."<P>I understand, but in order to contribute the Wizard basically does damage like a Warrior using a rusty sword, it seemed like something useful to bring up.<P>"Well, I disagree. I like the idea that players need to find new ways to do things, that they have to learn to use new spells every on occasion. I guess that using the argument that it’s hard and dangerous to have to learn how to use spells because they aren’t consistently available isn’t a very strong one."<P>Well that isn't exactly the artgument.  The problem is by level 30 or so people lose so much experience and are quite set in their ways that they are VERY unwilling to try anything risky like using AE spells.  Wizards get kicked out of groups for using them, do you realize that?<P>The other problem is that AE spells outnumber DD spells in the Wizard's repertoire, and there are only a few of them that really are worth pulling out and teaching people with.  This is part of efficiency for Wizards and is a fairly notable class feature.  Having these be more consistently useful and efficient would definitely help the class with their duty: Kill things.<P>Fixing Al'Kabor is one step in that path, so is AE Rain, but Al'Kabor will never be something more than a situational oddity (unless you REALLY change it a lot), and it can't really fill in as a workhorse AE spell.<P>"Aggro is a whole ‘nother ball of wax. But the things that you describe are fairly embedded into the system..."<P>Yeah and I wish they could be examined because they would make changes that would be fundamentally useful for balance.  Rangers overtaunt for their actions, its not their damage.  Just play a Ranger and any other melee class and you'll understand what I mean.<P>Backstabs that fail and partial/total resists taunt more than landing a full damage effect.  Creatures who have no conceivable way of knowing taunt on you as if you did full damage, how does a rat know my spell COULD have done 50 damage but only did 2?  That kind of thing is a balance issue because it affects your play constantly.  I can't blast very much already due to aggro, and if I get a full resist on a big blast not only can I not blast again a while (because he thinks I did MORE than full damage the way aggro is working now), I did nothing for the group for my mana which translates into down time.<P>Incidentally, not everything you have mentioned in the class talks is about balance, so you can throw us a few meaningless bones like graphics on spells and looking unique couldn't you?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Anyway I know you have a ton of stuff to talk over, I just hope at some point you can look into this.<P>(skyshrine evac)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Thanks for the great list, Absor.<P>One thing I'd like to mention about your most receint comment (pertinant exerpt pasted below): <P>While the Lure line is indeed less mana efficient and weaker per blast because of it's low resistability, the Draught line is our day-to-day, grind nuke post-50.<P>None of our Draught spells do even as much damage as the lvl 49 Rend, let alone Ice Comet. After level 49, we don't get a stronger single target DD than Rend until level 60, when we get 2 spells that out damage Ice Comet (Sunstrike and the rumored Ice Spear of Solist) and a Lure that outdamages any of our Draughts (Lure of Ice, 825 damage).<P>Pre-50, our DD upgrades at each spell circle were both are more mana-efficent and do more damage than our previous ones, but post-50 they get more mana-efficiant, while doing LESS damage per blast.<P>Post-50, we even get AE spells that do more damage per target than our latest single target nukes; the level 51 Pillar of Frost does 800 damage to each of up to four targets, while not one single target spell other than Ice Comet does this much damage before level 60.<P>At the very bottom of this post, I've included the progression of our single target DD spells, starting at level 34 to illustrate that our per spell damage goes up each circle until 51, where it jumps down and doesn't ever recover  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P><BR>*********repost********<P>&gt;”-Kyria brought up the problem with post-50 damage that has confused me since Kunark came out. Why does a Wizard's spell damage go down blast per blast? Isn't the class supposed to be about fast damage? Draught and Lure spells should have been in place at lower levels anyway. “&lt;<P>For less resistance, you get less efficiency. That’s how it works, and it makes sense.

</FONT><HR>Thank for you your attention and time, Absor.<BR>I just wanted to toss in a little note saying I agree 100% with Grimstaff.  I feel that what he is saying speaks for the majority of wizards out there.  <P>The reason we stick with our Wizards is not because of power.  We are putting up with imbalance because we've put time into these <BR>characters and have made connections.  Also, we know that there are fewer Wizards in Norrath than, say, Druids!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <P>And while the title is unique, our abilities are not unique at all!<BR>I want to ask you something.  You say to us, that if we want to be more group-friendly, we need to come up with ideas that don't encroach upon the abilities of other classes.  Well, I say to you that the other classes ALL encroach on the abilities of Wizards.  <BR>Ask yourself this, what can Wizards do that the other casting classes cannot (ie. a Druid)?  And then ask yourself, if the answer is nothing, why can't wizards come up with ideas that encroach a little on the other classes?<P>Just a thought,<BR>Thank you for your attention Absor, we all appreciate it!<P>Absydion Darkflame &lt;Bloodmoon Alliance&gt;<BR>45 Wizard<BR>Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>---Start Quote---<BR>&gt;”Wizards have Z-axis problems with the rain and snare spells. Please add this to your list.”&lt;<P>Really? Odd. I would think if this was a problem it would be a problem for all classes with those spells. And, as far as I can remember, you’re the only person to mention this in any of these threads. Does anyone else have this problem?<P>---End Quote---<P>Here is what I would think that person is talking about.  This is something I have done, I will try to explain it the best I can.<P>Zone: Frontier Mountains<P>Area: Near Giant Fortress<P>Target: Burynai Caverns<P>What: You can Hear the Burynais near the fort when you stand above them.  They will be under the ground below you.  With someone that can track, or you just guess, you can track and stand directly above one of these MOBs (Rockshaper or Cenobite due to the loot that they carry)  Once the member of the group that is tracking is above the MOB, you cast the rain spell on them (the member of your group).  This will then rain down on your group member, and the MOB under them, under the ground.   You can then stand just a bit out of range and pull the MOB thru the Ground and avoid all the MOBs that you would normally have to go thru to get to them from the Cavern Enterence all the way around the other side of the peak.<P>I am sure there is enough information here to get the idea of the Z axis problem.  And in truth this is a problem that should go under General Bugs.  We have all seen MOBs attack Thru the ground at us.  Or even MOBs above us that have a broken Z-axis and are "Stuck" in the air.<P>The Aviak Village in South Karana is another good example of the General bug problem here.  Any Penthouse group can tell you what a pain it is to have a MOB that got to the ground lvl when it ran away hit you fro mthe ground when you are up in the Penthouse.<P>The Z-axis bug is a problem that has always been around, but players that have experienced this "bug" also know how to avoid it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Thank you Absor for the work in compiling data from all the threads, and sorting through the whines and mitigating some of the less sane requests.  I have to say you have done a remarkable job thus far.  From the stand point of this 54 Wizard I think you are on the right track, but need to add one more voice to the masses concerning "balance".<P>I believe the class is diminished when they are no longer the Master of magical damage.  This is not because AE spells dont deal massive damage, they do.  This is because of playability of those damage heavy spells.  One writer pointed out (correctly) that Wizards are kicked out of groups for using them.  The majority of mid level players have very little idea of the power of the Rain spells, and will not group with someone who uses them.  The majority of post 50 players will not allow their use because the group makeup almost always includes an Enchanter and rain spells break mez.<P>The issue is more one of playability of the class than balance.  Players still see our class as powerful, but only in limited roles.  It is fair to say that most groups would only look for a Wizard when they need lures to kill or an evacuation/translocation.  <P>You asked for suggestions that would enhance the groupability of the class.  I think I have seen several that make very good sense.  <P>1. First and foremost would be to take all the guess work out of who wields the big magical stick in the realms.  I see no reason why Wizards should not have the most destructive spells of all classes.  No other should be remotely close, and the damage we deal out should be obvious to all around us as the HP bar on the mob drops drastically.  I don't mean Wizards should be gods, but I think we should have a base increase in damage over all spells in the level 35 plus range.<P>2. Perhaps the January 2000 post that indicated Wizards had an inately lower resist rate might need a revisit to ensure it was instituted properly, and if it was I suggest it be tweaked once again.<P>In a nut shell I firmly believe that significantly (please dont forget significantly)increasing damage and lowering resist rates will fix the groupability issue.  The remainder of the issues are really just "pointy hats" in my opinion.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, dear sir, thank you for reading through all of these posts, your initial response, and especially your recent update to this thread.  I believe you are seeing what our problems are and trying to make a difference.  Since my fellow wizards, Grimstaff, et al, have already made a host of excellent suggestions and comments, I will keep this brief.<P>As in all things, the devil is in the details.  I believe that many of the items you have noted from my college's posts would go a long way to repair our class.  If properly implemented, mana regeneration, spell efficiency, and percentage damage alone would do wonders.  However, I implore you to encourage the design team to ignore easy 5% "fixes" and look at substantial changes.  Half measures at this point will not provide a solution.  I have seen many excellent suggestions on making harvest an ability that scales as levels increase, and making meditation multiply in effect every ten levels or so.  I ask you pass on to the designers that the scale of the change is as important as the change itself when trying to affect repairs.<P>Personally, I find AoEs of little use and would much prefer to have a DD that was significant and reliable.<P>My only thought for group desirability is to show our damage.  When team members see "Wizard_00 does 1000 hp damage to Spanky_the_wonderMob" they will see that at least we are trying to pull our own weight.  This will be especially true if our spell damage is increased to handle the Velious Ubermobs.<P>Just my thoughts, thanks,<BR>Tiri</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have stopped reading this thread at page 3 to post.<P>I must say that after reading all these I am seriously considering giving up my account.<P>I just started playing any kind of MUD game 1 month ago - has a lvl 21 Wiz and is seriously not looking forward to any kind of fix there might be for the problems that are surfacing.<P>The Wizard must as well be called Master of nothing. If other caster class out damage us over the time with their pets as extras what claim do we have as Masters of damage? If other caster class out buff us with high AC increasing buffs what Master of defence are we? If other caster class has a great variety of different spell - e.g. nukers almost as good as us and also can summon pets and many other cool stuffs plus whatever else they can do(Mind you I saw a magi with a griffon pet and was really envious - not to mention someone say they can have HG pets) - what claim of Master of knowledge have we? Not to mention that there are some class that can fight, buff, nuke, snare, heal, shape transform and also teleport - haha - and we call ourselves the Master of knowledge? Oh please, the only knowledge that we can only proclaim to have a little (seriously not much) more than others is just magical damage (which will probably scratch some mobs - but make you sit long enough to prove your uselessness). Lets give our Master of Damage title to more deserving class like melee class warrior or monk etc. or caster class like magician. Lets give our Master of defence title to melee class like monks (who are great dodgers and blockers) or casters who can buff up much better than us. Lets give our Master of Knowledge title to classes who genuinely knows much more of how magic flows and transform in terms of knowing great number of ways that magic can be used e.g. druid, magi and enchanters. Lets not hide behind our artificially buffed up ego by pretending that we are the Masters of Knowledge, Damage and Defence because from anyone who had grouped with you they know you are not. Maybe we can proclaim ourselves to be the Useless Master. Useless to group (the mob feels some itch under his armpit and the rest of the team can't concentrate on one mob but has to try to stop you from dying - so that the whole group would not be delayed), useless as self (solo one time - furthermore only one blue mob and you sit medding twice the time you fight)and useless to others (count the number of times another would actually care to come up to you to say hi just because they mistake you for a magician who can summon food and drinks or a enchanter who can clarity or the druid or shammie who can sow). Thus the Master of uselessness the Wizard are.<P>Let me sum up some playing experience up to now. Below level 12 - struggle to put in some damage and prevent yourself from dying - the fun is ok. Level 12 to 19 is fine - for once you get spells that can deal a significant amount of damage - above and beyond the tanks if you cast fast. Above lvl 19 - what spells are there to prove worth casting? Enstill? It interupts, fizzles and resist on 2 green mobs on their way to bashing me to death so much that right now I revert back to my level four root. Tishan clash? Can I get it to work for more than once please. Force shock is ok - for once a dd spell that is less resisted - provided you have a tank to allow you to get it off or that you are pulling. However, if running around in circles (hopefully with sow) is what you want to do please do cast it more than once - that is if you don't kill the mob. So right now I had reverted back to using my level 12 spell lightning shock - it is a great spell - it did not require the line of sight (useful if you are not fighting giants), it is low aggro (come on it is just level 12) and it is very mana efficient (cause you let the tank take a little damage - and somehow they realise that you mana regeneration seems much faster for once - and you kill very effectively so that their hp will not drop too much and they can ensure a healthy numbers of pulls). That has since became my favorite spell for grouping for above lvl 20 mobs. I love playing in groups cause I feel that is the whole point of having a multi-user game. But can I be of some use to the group please - if Verant is not going to make the Wiz a efficient damage dealing character at least give it something that the group can look forward to getting from him/her. And if your team pulls a deep red which is higher do-able with big group (which is all the fun this game is about) - you can only med quitely - you can't even watch the battle - you have a book in your face or if you really have a guity consience after a few deep red that you decided to practice that 1HB or 2HB or piercing if not HTH skill of yours. The only thing you hope is that they could pull a less red mob which is less exp, extremely do-able by your full group and slightly more do-able by your useless Wiz.<P>I am beginning to feel that I had chosen the wrong class to start off with. (Well, ok I am only one month into the game - maybe I got it all wrong, maybe there is something down the road to look forward to). But, hey - why didn't I chose that cleric or druid or enchanter or magician that can contribute a bit more and give me the fun of playing in group. Argggg, don't tell me that anyone could enjoy solo play that much - sitting in front of the computer watching your mana bar increase and hopefully in about five mins you can stand up and maybe disintegrate that blue mob in sight?<P>I am thinking of terminating my account not because I think that by doing so will tickle Verant enough to do anything but really I am getting less and less fun out of the Wizzie - why can't you be one that every group is trying to grab hold of or at least not shun away from. I bet the groups if they need a Taxi man they would prefer the druids rather than the Wiz - they can fight, they can buff, they can DOT and DD quite well and they teleport you to safety - not into potentially exp losing danger.<P>Ahhhh, my fellow Masters of uselessness - wake up and stop thinking that you are actually Master of anything but uselessness.<P>Wish you all luck in your pursuit of Mastering uselessness - if that require any mastering at all.<P>From:<P>A humble Master of Uselessness</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor, please read all the posts instead of just the loudest.  We have some very old, experienced wizards posting great ideas and for the most part I think you are just reading the posts by the vocal minority.  Don't ignore my post just because I use proper grammar and don't capitalize every single letter!<P>I already critiqued 6 or 7 items on your list. If you are interested, scroll back up and read my previous post.<P>To address your second post, you said you didn't add group friendly stuff because no one suggested any good ideas that didn't infringe upon others.  I did!  And so did a ton of other people.  Blowing things up faster does NOT make us group friendly.  With the exception of teleports, I cannot cast any spells on my party.  Saying that teleports are enough is like saying Necros are group friendly because they can summon corpses.  Yeah it is great, and helps others, but it has absolutely no impact on 95% of fights.<P>Some group friendly spells I would like to see:<P>1)  The ability to cast offensive procs on other players.  I explained this in detail in the previous 11 thread monster post.  To summarize, we would be able to cast these spells on group mates that would allow them to proc spell effects in addition to their current weapon procs.  I suggested this over a year ago, as did others.  And I know you can code it because you recently gave the ability to hybrids and enchanters.  This would allow us to do indirect damage against mobs, wouldn't help us solo one bit, would help warriors taunt, and would make people like having a wizard in their group.  How is this bad?  Think of it as the opposite of mage damage shields.   It would make us extremely group friendly and not hurt anyone.<P>2)  Mana sharing.  Every int caster in the game except wizards has the ability to share mana.  When there is a wipeout and groups are being rezzed, mages, necros, and enchanters are all busy buffing and giving mana.  What do wizards do?  We go make ourselves a sandwhich!  I am worthless.  Why can't I share mana with the healers?<P>3)  Along the same lines, dozens of people have proposed group harvest.   How would giving 3/4 of a bubble of mana every 10 min to our group be unbalancing?  You saw no problem with giving us evac spells that suck away 2 bubbles from our entire party.  Why not allow us to give a little something back every now and then?<P>4)  I am level 58 but I still have to spend 5 minutes casting see invis and invis on people to escort them through Kael and similar places.  This is tedius and stupid.  Give us group see invis at low levels, and at high levels give us group Plainsight.  How will it unbalance the game if our groupmates can actually see?  And no, these spells won't step on the toes of others classes...my shaman friends can cast acumen on others but their mana is so valuable that they don't in any fight situation.  So let me do it.<P>5)  Along those same lines, the improved invis series should be group spells.  What purpose does it serve for me to cast the old invis on groupmates?  It drops every couple minutes, maybe a giant or two attacks them, and then they have to zone or kill it.  It doesn't kill us.  It doesn't add any risk.  It only adds tedium.  Things that are a real danger to us see invis anyway!  Invis spells are just a time saving device to avoid slaughtering hundreds of green mobs.  Why can't we cast the good invis on others?<P>Frankly, I don't think any of these spells are unreasonable.  I don't think anyone would cry bloody murder if we could do these things.  The only caveat is that if you let us cast improved invis on others, you have to let enchanters do the same.  But I just don't see that being unbalancing to anyone.<P>Gherad of Veeshan<BR>Level 58 wizard.<P><BR>P.S. - As a sidenote, the effect on our Velious quest armor boots is a little silly.  They require killing level 56+ giants in Kael and gathering three gems.  The stats are nice, but the effect is our level 4 damage shield!  At least make it our level 34 damage shield.  Talk about lack of group friendliness...my tank friends smack me whenever I cast that silly 2 point damage shield on them.  All it does is add spam and 2 points compared to mobs hitting for 360 is just a bit stupid.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

IF you had read my messages than you would have seen that it is not.<P>Yes at level 35 we are *supposed* to have an Innate Magic Resist Debuff. This was implemented lil over a year ago if I remember correctly. The way it was coded is that starting at level 35 Wizards are supposed to "roll" for the lowest resist # possible on each cast. Which also means you can still get the worst resist rate possible. As you level the better your chances in "rolling" are supposed to be.<P>Now I think this is why I had my problem Saturday night. In case you do not remember or just plain did not read my message. It is where I was resisted **5 times in a row** on a level 8 putrid skeleton. Does that sound like it is working properly?<P>Many reports of people being resisted on Ice Comet their first try. One person resisted on a skeleton, one person on an Orc Pawn! <P><BR>I think there needs to be a new method for giving us the Innate Magic Resist Debuff we were promised because our resist rates are just plain too high. We are seeing **negative** side effects to our class defining feature. There should be absolutely nothing stopping me from killin' a level 8 putrid skeleton w/ my spells. I had to stop casting b/c all my spells were being resisted and had to resort to melee.<P><BR>Now how can this be working properly?!<BR>Please address this.

But, they have to be much better at doing it then the other casters who bring more to a group.

</FONT><HR>My biggest problem is still the amount of damage I can per fight.  If I can only cast once or twice per fight, I am only contributing about 1/10th damage at best to a group of six, with no other contributions whatsoever.  (keep in mind the healler is doing 0 damage).  If you expect us to use lures, we are doing even less damage than that.  You are right in that our contribution to a group should be damage.  And if I do a full burn on one monster, I have to sit out of the next 4 fights doing 0 damage.  Bigger mana pool would make the down time worse.  I think faster mana regen of some sort is the only solution.  Make it so I can do about 1/4th the damage to a monster and regen it back before the next fight.  Wizards should outdamage everyone.  It is our job description.  Every melleer out damages me at level 54, and also can take a hit.  Adding more melleers is the way to go now days, they don't have down time at all.  Remember only one tank is actually taking damage at any one time on single pulls (and multiple pulls also most of the time), so the clerics job doesn't get harder with their addition.  Adding a wizard only means you have an exp sink with a little extra damage maybe every 3rd or 4th pull.  Not worth the trouble now days.  If the healler or mezzer is low on mana, eveything stops.  No one cares what the wizards mana is. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I noticed that resists were going to be discussed in a completely different area, but I do not know where that is.  I feel that I must have some input and I appologize if it is misguided.<P>Full resists for DD spells need to be completely removed all classes in PC to NPC casting.  And why shouldn't it be removed for NPC to PC casting?  Mobs are already overpowered.  Seemingly nfinite mana.. more hitpoints than PC's, caster NPC's being capable to deal great melee damage as well as magical based damage, etc etc..  Mobs are still and will be a great chalange to kill with benefit even if classes that need a boost in power do get it it will only create a greater variety of people killing mobs and remove group barriers rather than make the game "too easy."<P>DD spells should have a minimum damage against mobs proportionate to their level.  Because wizards are completey dependant on whether or not the spell does the intended damage, they should receive the highest minimum damage against mobs.<P>I'm not sure how low the minimum damage of DD's should be.  Since melees became so powerful and capable of immense amounts of damage over time the mobs ability of partial resists should be reduced.  By nuking you are sacrificing your ability (mana) to decrease the ability of the mob (make it dead).  There is nothing worse that sacrificing 20 percent of your ability to have it wasted.  Yes, its not exactly finite but it will take more than a minute to get it back (you'll be dead in 10 seconds if that resist came at an inopurtune time).<P>Solve this in one of two ways.  Greatly recrease mobs resisting ability and slightly increase mana regen (no class is more mana dependant than wizards) significantly decrease mob resist, greatly increase mana regen (2 fold. perhaps give wizards the highest meditate ability).<P>Criticals are a poor solution to anything.  While its a nice perk, do not use that as a fix.<P>Take the wizard spires out of west karana.  Place them in the Everfrost Peaks.  While moving the spires to the opposite side of the zone is nice, it is still quite ridiculous to have ports in adjacent zones.<P>The cazic thule gate is dangerous, but there are ways around it.  IE: have a friend clear the area of spawns before you gate.  Have someone invis you while casting the gate spell.  Leave this alone.<P>Add personal gates to kunark and velious before the group ports.<P>Decrease the resist rate of wizard snares.  If it is felt that the AE aspect of the wizard snare needs to be removed if the resist rate were to be lowered, than so be it.  But quad kiting is extremely dangerous, and those that are willing to take the risk, develop the skill, and make the execution of the ability should be able to maintain it.  Just lower the resist rate and let wizards have that group friendly utility (wizards have so few).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>For Wizards to make an impact in terms of damage for a group several things have to be true:<P>Wizards must do it faster and more furious than anyone else.  That means they bring the damage quicker and do more in the short term than any other class.  This damage must be actual damage a Wizard playing Everquest can produce, not a theoretical player on paper - that is, resistances and aggro have to be taken into account as well as efficiency and damage (no good if you theoretically can burn something down if it resists it heavily and aggros killing the Wizard).<P>Wizards must do KINDS of damage that no other class can equal.  This includes landing blasts on things other classes cannot (whatever the level might be, 50, 30, whenever it is an issue).  This includes types of damage others do not have, such as efficient AE spells and fire/cold/magic damage to work around resistances and situations that others have no access too.  This should also include a way around the 6+ resistance cap that cripples Wizards utterly.<P>Wizards must be the most mana efficient in their fast damage.  Because the focus is to be on fast damage and emergency destruction by Verant's decision, the mana is an important aspect.  Dumping destruction in a hurry means that your total damage should contribute meaningfully to the group even while you are sitting down.  In other words, your contribution to the group should be so meaningful and beneficial that when you are sitting down and doing nothing the group is glad you are there.<P>I call this the Cleric effect.  Nobody in the group cares if the Cleric is sitting and doing nothing, because their contribution is so important.  Nobody minds the Magician sitting and meditating because her pet and damage shields are helping out.<P>Wizards have to have this kind of contribution or they will never EVER be group friendly.  The way to do this is make the Wizard's damage contribution and flexibility be unmatched in the game in such a manner people are protective of the Wizard and want to keep that cannon going.<P>Back in the day, people were mistaken into believing that Wizard damage WAS that important a contribution and this used to be the way people acted.  But as time has passed, now people ask for mana totals, but they don't care what the Wizard's is... just the Cleric.<P>If you make damage and evacs the primary focus of the class and how we are to be group friendly that must be reflected for damage the way I noted above.  In addition, the evacs must be attractive.  Skyfire evac is a deathtrap, that does NOT make a Wizard group friendly.  Please try to keep that in mind.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>Let me give you an idea of why our reliance on pure DD damage as it stands now is woefully underpowered.  I'll give you two true examples from Velious.<P>1)  I take my group of 4 into Skyshrine to kill cubes and wyverns.  I am the highest in the group (at level 58) and a quarter of the mobs are green to me.  I think it will be cake.  We begin fighting with the troll warrior tanking, the cleric healing, the SK pounding away with his pet helping him out.  What do I do?  Well, I think I'll start by snaring.  My cheapest snare is BoF which I cast a dozen times (literally!) on this green cube we are fighting.  It never sticks.  It sticks 4 times all night (out of more than 60 tries before I finally gave up on it).<P>Well, ok then, maybe I'll just blast him.  So I load up draught of fire and blast away.  Resist!  This mob is green to me!  I load up every flavor of nuke I have and try em.  Magic is totally resisted, so is cold, fire gets partial resists.  Resists are so bad, I end up switching to lure of flame.  Lures on a green mob!<P>So let's examine my role in the group.  I don't melee, I don't heal, I don't buff, I can't snare;  all I can do is lure runners.  So I am stuck using a damage spell with 2:1 efficiency on green mobs.  And these green mobs have 10k+ hps.  I have some nice gear and about 3000 mana.  It takes me about 11 min to med to full, so that is 6k damage per 11 min.  My warrior companion does 6k damage per mob!  Any other class I could think of would have been better than myself in that group.  Where is my the king of magic damage?  He certainly isn't me.<P>2)  A group of 6 is hunting giants in Kael.  This is better, giants don't have those insane resists.  It only takes me two tries to snare them.  I can use normal nukes on them (no lures).  So I am efficient right?  Not even close.  These things have 20k hps.  My warrior, rogue, hybrid friends all smack down the giants.  The shaman slows him so fast burning is pointless (not that I could burn down 20k damage fast anyway).  It is one big melee fest.  Fast damage is what wizards do, and fast damage is irrelevant now.  Big deal if I can do 10k damage in 90 seconds.  That won't even get the mob to half!  And assuming he doesn't have absurd MR and resist every single concussion so that I can actually survive a burn like that, I am oom and contribute nothing for 3 or 4 fights.<P>I hope you see my point.  At high levels, the idea of fast damage is just silly.  The mobs have so many hps that I can't make any significant difference in their hps.  Long gone are the days when I could burn a full load of mana and completely destroy a mob my group is fighting.  And these aren't uber mobs!  These are normal blue mobs that people hunt for xp.<P>I need more efficient damage, I need indirect damage or ways to help my tanks, I need group friendly spells.  Teleports are not enough.  If all they need is a ride to the dungeon, my friends can easily log a wizard onto a second account and port themselves over.  Any monkey can figure out how to mem a port spell and cast it.  Wizards need a valuable role in everyday combat in Velious.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Most of our big issues seem to be out in the air, all though I don't think Alan has fully realized all of them.<P>Invis to Undead - I don't understand why folks want to nerf this, nor why we are suggesting nerf's for our own class.  This spell is very handy, and I think it belongs in our line-up.<P>Snares - AE snare is great for stopping trains, once again - no need to suggest nerfing an ability that currently makes us somewhat competitive.  We don't know what changes will come from this and there is no since in cutting the limb of we are standing on. =)<P>Abscond\Evac - The problem with this is not just the fizzle rate, its the whole spell.  I'm baffled as to what the intention was for the mana-sucking,slow casting, non agro-removing fizzler of a spell.  It has no value other than to speed travel in a few zones and even then the sheer mana cost makes it undesirable.  It will never save your groups arsk in a difficult situation, so I see no reason to ever keep it memmed...<P>Translocate - Great spell!  Consider CoTh for Wizards please.

</FONT><HR>Ok I wasn’t gonna post again, but I also was gonna cut down on my EQ playing time and if anything I’ve increased it so here goes:<P>I’m getting a little confused after reading Absor’s second post in this thread. What is the purpose of these posts? Are we to argue perceived problems? Are we to argue perceived solutions? Are we to argue both?<P>Blasts wrote: <BR>&gt;”I still see not even one mention of anything even remotely group friendly. This is the number ONE reason why wizards are broken. All other issues are simply contributing factors that make the matter worse, why is that so hard to understand? There simply is no reason to have a wizard in a group. “&lt;<P>Absor replied:<BR>I’m listening. Make some suggestions. But there’s a caveat. Do it without turning the wizard into one of the other classes (I’ve seen requests for massive crowd control...).<P>My take:<BR>Ok people ARE making suggestions. Yes a lot of them make suggestions that would turn a wizard into one of the other classes and I AGREE that should NOT happen. But the part of Absor’s reply that is bugging me is that if no one is able to come up with compelling arguments for perceived solutions, is Verant gonna drop the issue? Wizard group unfriendliness is a perceived problem by most wizards and by most other classes (and I know this is a catch 22 based on both poor class concept design AND wizards’ contribution to their own ‘bad press’). Nonetheless, this perception is there and needs to be addressed.<P>To answer my own question from above regarding the purpose of these posts, I think the players’ main contribution in this thread should be to argue the perceived imbalances of the wizard class. This information, by the way, comes AT NO CHARGE for Verant. Perceived solutions argued by players (also FREE information for Verant) should be considered bonus material. I think that ultimately, Verant should provide the solutions that satisfy the arguments being made about wizard class imbalance. In short, Absor’s reply bothers me a bit because it seems to imply that if we, the players, cannot make a good argument for a solution to the group friendliness issue, then perhaps the ball is left to sit in our court. Obviously, I think that the solutions and their implementation are the responsibility of Verant. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Few things from a 58 wizard.<P>I really hope this isn't just lip service to keep players coddled and that we're really looking at ways to make the game more enjoyable and for each class to be reasonably desired. <P>Personally I think Wizards should significantly outdamage ANY melee class, including backstabbing rogues in the short and long fights. Remember we have essentially nothing for armor and hitpoints. That's our handicap. For high level groups it goes this way..<P>Always need a Cleric, Enchanter and 2 or 3 melee classes to absorb the damage  and actually do the killing. That leaves one group spot open. Wizards are not usually the choice to fill that void. If a well equipped warrior or rogue does more damage than us over the long term what's the point in a wizard being there at all? How should it work?<P>We're not a buff class so we have to compete with the other damage dealers, melee, in order to benefit the group. Because of our lack of armor and ability to take damage even doing the same damage as a rogue or warrior is pretty pointless.<BR>I can't do a CR or pull mobs for the group or taunt them off the healers, if I could I'd be dead anyway. You want to fix wizards simply significantly raise their damage output in the short and long term. When a group thinks about having to do the damage to kill something they should think, we need a wizard to do the big damage. We need the tanks anyway to absorb the damage, taunt and pull. The melee people will always be needed no matter how much damage the Wizard is able to do. <P>As for balance, significantly upping our damage output won't matter since agro, summoning mobs and our lack of ability to take hits from anything blue keeps us in check.<P>The rest of the discussion is more or less fixing things that are broken and really won't make any impact on the class other than mana regen rate. Bumping the mana regen rate a good deal will solve the long term damage output problems but as it is to compete with melee of my same level I have to essentially chain nuke/ concussion and burn out all of my mana just to stay level with the warriors and rogues for a single fight. Of course then I have to sit for 5 minutes while the melee people kill 4 or 5 more mobs and I do nothing. That's when I have Clarity 2. Without it things are so out of whack it's silly. <P>I'll hold my breath and see what happens over the next few weeks to see if any fix is really in the pipeline. The danger with making reaching lvl 60 such an investment in time is that there is no way for any reasonable person to switch classes. It comes down to fix the classes or lose customers when you're talking about the high level part of the game. People don't start over for the most part. <P>Tutmos Howitzer<BR>58 Wizard Karana<BR>Valoran</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Absor, if you MUST read one post, it HAS to be this one:<P><BR>Part I :  The Problems and Wizards as they are now.<P><BR>(Forewarning: i'm not saying other classes are "not broken at all"...I know everyone thought an Enchanter was a God, but i knew the issues they had back when I played one.  Plz don't take this as "Mages are better" or what have you...any comparision is made as a "why have a wizard?" not as a "X class has no problems.")If you simply want us DD based and 2ndary Evacer...then i'll work within those terms.  I'll show you just how it works, then you can argue with me.<P><BR>Ok, if we are to be the true masters of DD (this doesn't include DoTs.)  Well, every caster in game has similar DD efficiency/dmg as we do.  Some might have no options to which kind of magic it is: Mages getting Fire DDs only.  Well, if they don't have the variety and can't hit a mob w/ fire in Sol A...are they going to go to Sol A as much?  Their pet will help, but really, wouldn't you avoid it?  So, in effect, the mage CAN get around fire dmg spells by going to Velious or Permafrost.  So, right there we can eliminate the "Type of Spell" argument.  Ppl will find ways to make their type of spell work on a type of monster.  In effect, their DDs are similar to Wizard's spells at this lvl.  <P><BR>Bolts too you say?  Get up close to the monster, I have bolts too...it's rare we have 5 ppl tanking a monster all around the monster w/o an opening for a close bolt.  So, in effect these types of spell: Bolts and "Fire resistant mobs can't be hit with fire"...that can be gotten around especially with the addition of new content.  Again, this closes the gap in DD that a wizard can do over another class.<P><BR>So, what if we assume the wizard CAN'T outshine others with just DD right now.  Well, with the buffs the Druid gets, the pets Mages get (yes, I know abuot the pet issues, this is sometimes pathing and this needs fixed on Verant's end), and the buffs Enchanters get...they can bring MORE to the table than the Wizard.  THe Enchanter enhances the group SO much in terms of mana and dmg speed that you simply wouldn't want a Wizard for their meager edge in DD.  Casting faster comes in handy sometimes-- but the mage can cast almost as fast and has a pet.  The Druid can simply heal someone in trouble...same w/ Shaman, Cleric.  The other classes have a way around "not being able to dmg as fast" which is actually better. I'd heal the group mate in trouble b4 I blasted the monster to the ground.  So, actually, the situation that calls for casting faster is actually FILLED better by another class.  Enchanters even get RUne....YES, I used to use them on weak members to save them ALL the time.  <P>(Notice I left out the Necro and the DoTs...if you want a plain comparision to DDs, then I won't include DoT examples.  Though I'd like you to take a moment and think about it nonetheless.  Damage done by a caster is still damage done by a caster, whether it's over 5 minutes or 5 seconds.  Players don't really see the difference between DoTs and DDs as long as the caster is making a huge difference and helps killing the monster.  Call the DDs, call them DoTs...whatever damages better w/o sucking up group resources gets the group.)<P><BR>Now, you can say AE is awesome...don't get me wrong, it really is if u have the Pillar spells.  I've been finding ingenious ways of using them recently.  Wanna know the problem?  In group w/ an Enchanter you have AE mes....it's MORE reliable then my AE dmg spells.  You can use AE dmg instead of AE mes...but MOST ppl (as is a better option) choose AE mes.  I've urged ppl to try it my way, and my guild has....but when we get an enchanter in the group, it's back to AE mes.  UNDERSTAND, it's not players misguided ideas about AE this time...it simply IS smarter to AE mes (i've been a high lvl enchanter, now i'm a wizard.)  I always have at least one mob come for me, and then I can't cast AEs unless i'm outrunning the mob (Because I cast Bond of Force on him) and then target the mobs on my tank for an AE and cast.  2 wizards in group can burn down the monsters fast in an AE train...even just using the Pillar spells (which I only use...we need Pillar upgrades every lvl.)  (I also watch my agro too, so plz don't tell me i'm doing it wrong.)<P><BR>I've done the "kill the train faster than anything with AEs"...it's a great thing...especially Enchanterless and in danger.  But, you always have mobs on you...right now I snare and root them...but what happens at higher lvls when root is MUCH more resisted and mobs can mutilate you in seconds (35+ gaming.) ??  I won't be doing that then.  PLUS, lets also remember, pulling a train out of a dungeon isn't a wise idea.  Just yesterday, my team was moved from LOIO and we had to relocate to OT and do single monster pulls..why???  Well, we had a bunch of other PCs come in and pull in the Gob caves, and pulling a mob out of the cave entrance would have gotten them killed.  Many ppl that see a train coming panic-- YES, this is a perception from other ppl....but i've heard of ppl getting reported for "pulling constant trains."  Also, u can be careful with these train pulls but something can always go wrong.  And in all the excitment of burning down the train....someone in another group there MIGHT get killed-- ultimately why we stopped pulling trains and using AEs and went to OT and did single target DDs.  &lt;-- not cool.<P><BR>I'm saying the times called for AE dmg is limited, and later in lvls, when Enchanter's CC is a MUST...i'm expecting to see less of the AE dmg opportunities.<P><BR>The arguement is, everyone knows already, that Al'kabor are too mana inefficent...and Rain highly resisted, that's all I'll say on those lines.<P><BR>Ok, i've covered (and it's a working essay so far as I'm concerned, I'm getting my bearings and trying to figure out where i'm going as much as summarizing the above):<P>- DD related to other classes and how efficient they are to us<BR>- the argument about "only certain types of spells, not as much variety as the wizard" idea...fire spells not affecting fire monsters<BR>- DoT and how in perception of players, it's no different than DDs<BR>- AE dmg being our strong point, but having few situations to shine in it...and putting others in dangerous situations pulling large amounts of monsters<BR>- Al'kabor and Rain useless<P>Currently, I am able to cast possibly between 5 to 7 (don't know exactly as I don't chain cast, isn't that ironic?) DD spells in a row b4 I am oom.  I can burn all my mana in about 30 seconds on a one pull monster.  Currently, as a lvl 30 Wizard I have no way to regen mana faster any other casters: Excluding, Shaman's Canabilize, Necro's Lich, Enchanter's Clarity (I will get an extra bub of mana every 10 minutes from my Harvest spell in a few lvls though.)  And I have no way in which to make passive dmg or to do my job with a set cost of mana: Mage's Pets, Clerics AC and HP buffs, Necro pets, etc.  Once I am out of mana, I sit down (if the monster doesn't agro on me because I'm sitting) and meditate to contribute once more.  <P><BR>Now in reality, I can't chain cast on monsters or I'd simply be dead  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Now, I usually add 2 blasts per monster pull.  If the tanks decide to pull constantly...then I eventually get to the point of constant meditation JUST to get back enuff mana for one blast and to save mana in case I need to gate (I just got evac, but i'll get to that later.)  In long drawn out battles, I'm quite useless (unless you see one blast on a monster that might get full resistance or parital resistance of like 4, helpful...hey, a warrior can kick harder.)  Mana regen to monster wearing down the tanks and Cleric healing simply don't scale correctly.  I can go oom fast, and if a tank pulls a blue to us or black...he doesn't get hurt fast enuff that the Cleric has to chain cast:  Fact is, only time I see clerics chain casting heal is when I overblast...ooppsie  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">   )<P><BR>The difference here?  None, who cares if u end up hurting the monster by magic or by blade?  As long as it goes down the most efficient way to the group, why have a wizard who does little in constant pulls.  And constant pulling is ideal for more exp.<P><BR>Now I've covered:<P>- OOM and other casters can keep up and so can Preists thru other means<BR>- OOM and how tanks can keep up with some heals thrown in for constant pulls<BR>- How it doesn't matter how u hurt it as long as it's dead the best way<P><BR>I'll deal with utility spells.  Most are based on sight spells.  Most are useless as we dont' really need to see things because we are medding.  Druids/Rangers track.  Warriors/tanks pull.  Wizards sit stationary (even if FOM just stand there) because a roaming wizard is a dead wizard.  Eye of Zomm might help if agro was removed and duration was upped....who cares if we scout ahead?  So?  We can see what's in there.... that's an advantage how?  You'd rather we go in blind and get trained to death?  Invravision is mainly useless (don't get me wrong, don't remove it, Humans and Erudites need it) but, Self-only invravision...I'm a gnome *shrugs*  And Chill sight is lvl 39...I might cast that a few times for fun.  <P><BR>Roots..they work fairly well (though I already know how they worked for the enchanter w/ Tash line, so I guess I was expecting the resists.)  I assume I'll never get a root in...and when I do I'm happy. They work well enuff for me.  These and Bonds of Force are really the only utility spells I see worthwhile as a Wizard.  Course, Levitate is good when needed too  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>At lvl 30, I can't think of anything other than Root/BoForce/Levitate/Bind that really is at our disposal...others are just useless sights or Dmg spells.  Now, with these utility spells, Root is quite unreliable...starting 20+ in lvl....however, it's the only way to keep us from taking dmg in a group w/ multiple pulls on us.  BoForce is VERY nice.  It really does help the NON-soloing wizard. I ASK you not to nerf this spell, please find a way to deal w/ kiting wizards, not the grouping wizard.  If I get agro on me from a monster, I have time to back up, root it and then go back to AE casting on the other mobs.  We don't have our own personal pet, or mez line to deal with mobs on us.  This I think is our complaint.  Mages have pets that they have attack a monster and it helps keep the agro off the mage...Necros too (plus DoTs do dmg over time...which is better because tanks can add up agro while the Necro is still damaging constant and medding)...Enchanter's have Mez.  Preists all have heals, Druids (and I think Shamans) have root spell...Shamans get pets....Clerics usually aren't dmging much.  But heals can agro i know...but all preist classes have higher armor too...and energy.  Plus the AC/HP buffs.<P><BR>Which is a great lead into my part II argument about how agro works and future visions of the wizard...but right now i'm focusing on our problems.<P><BR>Ok, now i've dealt with:<P>- Useless utility spells and the wizards role<BR>- Our only useful lines of utilties and why nerfing them further damages the wizard class in GROUPING terms.<P><BR>Alright, I think this brings us to the last but not least Evacs and TPs.  Ok, our ability to evac and TP you said is 2nd to the Druid.  Lets start with our 20 lvl self gates.<P><BR>At lvl 20, we get Tox (good coverage on Odus), Gfay (good coverage on Faydwer), and NK (small section of Antonica mostly useless as far as dungeons and cities.)  The Karanas are HUGE...NK is far from Halas and Qeynos....and WK and EK don't have anything in them.  Mainly this is a nice port to TP powerlvlers to kite in Karanas.  Whatever the intent, we don't have anything near the Freeport area like Druids.  If we truly are secondary TPers....I can see u doing this.  However, it's rediculous...I think the "Vision" is wrong....it just serves to anger the wizard about not getting good coverage of Antonica (I know I hate it still...i'm going thru the 2nd version:  No TPs near Freeport...and of course everytime I see a TP request it's to that area.)  We lack coverage on our self gates until 4 lvls higher to Freeport.  PLUS, at lvl 24 we can't use Cazic-Thule gate, so we have to port to NK or NRo and run to the Feerrott area or whereabouts we wanna be.  This may have been how you decided to make us "2ndary" by making us have horrible port spots, but it really only causes frustration...and woe to the wizard that doesn't know the rules yet.  <P><BR>Since we have a lacking ability to damage over others already, and mainly useless utilities...we also see the fact that our TPs/Selfgates/Evacs are 2ndary too.  So where do we stand?  Not enuff coverage at 20 sux and should be changed.  The Cazic-Thule port is still dangerous in the 30s.  We have coverage problems.  Then add to that, we can't TP to Kunark until lvl 34 !!  So our coverage isn't as good as a druids.  <P><BR>Then there's the problem of evacing and TPs.  At lvl 29 we again don't get a Freeport port...we have to wait until AFTER a hell lvl to get one.  Coverage again is bad.  The funny part is, at lvl 29 we get an Evac to NK...and if u r fighting in Kunark...it's useless...the tanks would rather die and spend the time to find a res.  Cause everone knows the Wizard can't TP to Kunark until lvl 34.  So, if the wizard is fighting anywhere on Antonica far from NK or in Kunark or Velious...his evac is useless.<P><BR>Even at lvl 34, Wizards still get crappy (but workable at this point) TPs:  Cazic-Thule and Nektulous.  Hopefully in CT u can invis b4 going in and make it out relatively safe.  <P><BR>Personally i'd fix all this by moving WC self gate and port down a lvl.  Add a selfgate Dreadlands at 24...and Kunark/Velious TP at 29.<P><BR>Also, in Kunark the continent is huge compared to our one TP there.  Again, not enuff coverage (this time shared by Druids)....there needs to be more port points added to Kunark (and possibly Velious I dunno much about Velious.)  Here, we can't use our powers to get ppl around easier and that's our job: albeit secondary.<P><BR>Also, the dangerous landing areas of Ports needs addressed...to further make us Secondary you allow monsters to possibly roam in and kill us when we land.  That is not cool at all.  We DESERVE a safe passage to other lands.  All this does "making us secondary in TPs" is frustrate the wizard further.  If I ever decide to play my wizard that high, I'll shake b4 I cast that Velious portal...not knowing what to expect.  All dangerous ports need moved.  Porting into dangerous situations isn't what is desired and further cripples the power of the wizard. <P><BR>Ok, covered:<P>- Selfgates/TPs/Evac not enuff coverage and how getting spells at the wrong lvls makes our evacs suffer<BR>- Dangerous port in locations<P><BR>Ok, I think this wraps it up for my part one post, next post i'll try to add WHAT we need, and WHAT will happen if stuff is done a certain way.  Please, Absor, I ask you to argue my points in this if u don't believe me...took me 1 1/2 to write it up.<P>Krytal, lvl 30 Wizard of E'ci...Formerly Rakadar lvl 42 Enchanter of E'ci.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>*******Anyhow. The one thing I seem to have missed is any real method of making wizards more group friendly. But it seems that most of the ideas I’ve seen to do that are pretty... out of whack. Personally, I think that if we find a way to make wizards a little more efficient with their ability to blow stuff up, then they will immediately become wanted. I don’t agree that you have to have ‘group’ spells to be useful in a group. But if you folks can come up with a way to be more group friendly without just taking some other classes group-friendliness spells or something, chime in. But I have to admit, I didn’t see anything like that in any of the threads. Evaks and damage are what wizards bring to a group, and I think that should be enough, if it’s all working right.<P>Alan<BR>**************<BR>One spell I would think would be group friendly would be an unresistable, mem blur, translocate spell vs Mobs.....Sends the mobs back to their bind point and mem blurs them so they stay put...A battle gets out of hand, the wizard can translocate: Monster....this gets rid of the monster and saves the group.<P><BR>Now of course there has to be a rider on it....cant Trans Trakanon or Inny or something, but I think this is an excellent spell idea....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>---<P>ITEM: Spell efficiency.<P>DESCRIPTION: As monsters gain more hit points, the wizard is finding his mana comparatively less and less useful (since it's use is mostly for making monster hit points go away). Also, as a general rule, it seems that magicians can produce nearly as much damage per point of mana as a wizard (based solely on damage spells, not considering pets). Wizards would like a more efficient mana to damage ratio across the board, but specifically when dealing with the massive monsters of Velious.<P>STATUS: None<P><BR> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>One way to do this would be to increase the usefulness of Specialisation.  This can be achieved by making it so that if there is a successful roll then the spell cast can have up to (level/10) mana effiency.  This will mean that at level 60 a wizard could possibly cast Sunstrike and do 1615 damage at 269 mana instead  of 450.<BR> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>---<P>ITEM: Percentage Damage Spells.<P>DESCRIPTION: A spell line idea that would allow wizards to keep up with the massive hit points of some NPCs. The spell would do damage that was a percentage of the targets current hit points. This would allow the wizard to do more damage to bigger monsters and less to smaller ones.<P>STATUS: None<P><BR> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>I like this idea but you said "percentage of the targets current hit points." I dont think you mean it like that because then as the mob gets closer to death then the spell does less damage. For example, if the mob has 1,000 hp and my spell does 5 percent damage, then i will do 50 points of damage.  But after that mob has been beaten on and it is down to 300 hp i will only do 15 damage.  So the spell should do a percentage of the creatures total max hps.<BR> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>---<P>ITEM: Snare/Enstill.<P>DESCRIPTION: It sure does seem odd to suddenly get a group snare without ever having snare. Replacing the AoE snare with a single target snare might make more sense out of the spell line, and probably reduce quad kiting. This might also be considered a nerf by some. Also, there is a call to give Enstill a minimum duration. It seems that wizards think this spell breaks too early too often.<P>STATUS: None<P><BR> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><BR>Please leave Bonds of Force alone.  We are wizards, not druids or rangers we dont need a single target snare.<BR> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>---<P>ITEM: Invisibility to Undead.<P>DESCRIPTION: Why do wizards have this spell?<P>STATUS: None<P><BR> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><BR>Again, leave this spell as is.  Wizards are selfish and should not depend upon others for utility aides.  We should also have a self-only enduring breath.<BR> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/frown.gif"><P>---<P>ITEM: Teleport - West Karana.<P>DESCRIPTION: Move this portal to the other side of the zone. This has its fair share of technical nightmares (complete rebuilding of the zone and time to download it). But it’s worth looking into, especially with the possible addition of new bind points.<P>STATUS: None<P><BR> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>Leave this gate but give us an evac to Everfrost and just use one of the ruins presently there.  Also, give druids a succor to surefall.<BR> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>---<P>ITEM: Critical Hits with Spells.<P>DESCRIPTION: After all, warriors can do it, and it doesn't cost them mana. If wizards are specialized in doing damage, then why not give them critical hits with damage spells? The critical could be more damage, a stun, or some other effect.<P>STATUS: None<P><BR> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR>These criticals can work so that the spell can do (level X 100%) additional damage. Level 60 will do at max potenial 60% more damage but at 40 it will do 40% more damage, at max potenial  and magic (lightning) spell can have an "evade" (or concussion) effect to them.  The ice spells can "freeze" (stun) the mob and the fire spells can do added damage on top of the critical damage but have this additional damage done over the next 1 (or 2) ticks.  <BR>So for example the spell: Magic Attack, at level 40 can do a max of 450 damage. If critical hit is achieved then it can do 630 damage instead. But the wizard would be moved up to #2 on the hate list because of it but, if successful then the "evade" effect will cause the wizard to be move to #3 on the hate list.<BR>The spell Ice Attack, at level 50, can do a max of 700 damage and a critical will have it do up to 1050 damage but also stun the creature for 3.0 secs (this includes "unstunnable" mobs)<BR>Finally, Fire Attack, at level 30, can do 350 damage but with a critical it can do 455 damage immeditatly but it will do an additional 53 damage a tick for 2 ticks.<BR> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>---<P>ITEM: Suppression spells.<P>DESCRIPTION: A spell that would make is so that a target could not cast a certain spell type or use an ability type. The most common suggestion of this type of spell was to prevent gating or summoning.<P>STATUS: N/A – This is an idea for future use, no action is expected on this item at this time.<P><BR> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> <BR>Personally, I think a spell like this should be an enchanter spell and it should stop a mob from casting ALL spells. But a way that a wizard could get this spell is if it was an PBAE spell that prevented all PCs and NPCs, including the caster, in the area to be unable to gate, evac, succor, etc.<BR> <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Absor:<P>More thoughts on subjects on your mind about Wizards.<P><BR>AE Kiting<BR>===========================================<BR>This is a symptom, not the actual problem. If grouping was easier to do than more would grouping. Plus, there will always be loners. People that prefer to do their own thing. Personally I do not see how this has a negative impact on the game.<P><BR>Making the Wizard Class Group friendly<BR>===========================================<BR>You wanted ideas? <P>#1<BR>Well actually I think you are on the correct path IF you stay with mana regen. The #1 most harmful thing a caster suffers, especially Wizards, when it comes to group desirability is - downtime. People dislike casters because of their downtime.<P>So if you give Wizards someway to reduce their downtime, via mana regen by making it possible so that EVERY Wizard can benefit (i.e. no uber quest, uber mob drop etc.) rather than just those select few who have a great guild than we are on the way. We good mana regen tho, I am not talking Breeze level. I am talking better than Clarity level. If you want to make it so it is harder to solo than make it so the big advantages of this mana regen come thru medding.<P>#2<BR>Make our resist rates more on par with what they should be. My message before this explains how we were supposed to get an Innate Magic Resist Debuff starting at level 35, but how it has more negative side effects than the desired intent.<P><BR>#3<BR>Get rid of 6 level cap on our spells, like your list suggests. It is the whole perception idea behind this. Other classes know we can not hit anything that is over 5 levels so they refuse casters based on this.<P><BR>The mana regen is key. You could probably eliminate #2 and #3, but to make us truly desirable than help reduce our downtime. That truly hurts us. I know this is not want you wanted to see, but it IS something you can implement without making brand new spells.<P><BR>Far as mana efficiency goes, someone else suggested this (sorry for the bad memory), but make the Specialize skills more effective. If Specialize Evocation was more effective than you would not have to mess with every spell code ...well in theory, I do not know how the game was programmed.<P>Shenlung</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think all we are really tring to say is:<BR>Make us group-friendly!<P>There is NO point in soloing after 50, and with Velious, even before then, since we all know people are loot-obsesed fools and nothing thats really soloable (possibly excluding necros, but this is not the necro thread) can drop what people would now deem "uber" or even "decent"<P>However you do it, and I've seen alot of posts with some sold ideas, and then there are those which aren't so solid, please do it.<P>Out of all honesty, and being a wizard myself (and I love my wizard, ask anyone who knows me: Illarian, TM server) I am nuts about her.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> But if I were to make a group in Seb, I would take a: druid, necro, magician* or even another tank!<P>Its not that we don't have potential, we are the one class that has too much and not enough use of it. Use some of it and we will shut up.<P>We are probably (though personally I would say by far) the only "unbalanced" class out there. Especcialy when it comes to grouping. We aren't a new class, this is not an attempt at a flame, its just trying to draw attention to some long-lasting and somewhat deep-seeded problems with the way wizards currently are.<P>As a "professional" wizard, I have to say, I think we are just a little below par with the rest of the classes out there since everything we do (with the exclusion of harvesting) can be done by another class in the game. Ports - druid (no qualms) Roots - every casting class but magicians (as it should be) Snares - necros, druid (no qualms) Nukes - magicians can equal us and infact pass us at lvl 34 I think<P><BR>What we want:<BR>! Faster mana-return<BR>! More mana-efficient spells<BR>  - GJ with Ice Spear of Solist (4:1 dmg:mana) is getting there<BR>!

</FONT><HR>This is the first of two posts because I wanted to highlight Grimstaff's response to the level 35 lowered resists buff from Absor's comments.<P>I hope you see this, Absor, because it is quite possible that something wizards desperately need has gotten "broken" as Kunark and Velious were released.<P>From Grimstaff's post above:<BR>---------------------------------------------<P>Here is how Abashi Described it in January of 2000:<P>The changes to Wizards mean that for any Wizard above Level 35 they get a lower chance of their Cold, Fire, or Magic spells being resisted. In reality their spells are basically given a built in "debuff" factor. This stacks with any other debuff, such as Tashania, Malosi or Temperate Flux and gives Wizards much better combat effectiveness. It is not a duration debuff. It does not mean when you cast a DD spell the mobs resistance is lowered for other casters in the group. What the tweak does is when a DD spell is cast it looks at the current resistance of the target, and then the new tweak reduces that resistance amount further, then uses that new reduced resistance within the game formula to determine if the spell lands, or is partially or fully resisted. This process is done each and every time you cast a spell which is enchanced by the new code. Wizards should now notice the following with these types of spells now:<BR>·Green Mobs: Rarely Resisted <BR>·Blue Mobs: Rarely Resisted <BR>·White Mobs: Much Lower Resistance <BR>·Yellow Mobs: Much Lower Resistance <BR>·Light Reds: You will now have a much better chance against these mobs. <BR>·Deep Reds: Regular Resistance, with a slight chance of the "debuff factor" assisting. <BR>This tweak for Wizards doesn't change the 6 level cap. <P>It simply makes general combat much easier for the Wizard Class. They should be able to use more powerful spells with less resists on mobs that would be resisted by most other members of the party. It should help to keep the Wizard the true masters of direct damage spells."<P>-----------------------------------------<BR>End of the quote from Grimstaff.<P>I believe you can find the original that Abashi wrote on "http://eq.castersrealm.com" in their archives, Absor.  I think there is a direct link to that entry in a short post on page 6 or 7.<P>Hope this helps ...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,(great idea at the bottom, please read this post carefuly)<P>About evacs.<P>Why is it that so many people think that evacs are the answer to the wizards.... inadiquicy?<P>Absor, I am going to be VERY specific for you, because thats what you say you want.<P>First, IF my group wants me to have evac ready, then I must keep about one full bubble of mana at all times, because evacs cost a whole 300 mana. This further cuts down on my ability to do damage, because now I have 4/5 as much mana to blast with. I have to tell my group I am out of mana when I get to 20%.<P>I can not use Harvest as my source of mana for the evac. The evac takes 9 seconds to cast. That is actualy a very long time, and someone usualy dies before I finish casting. If I were saving my harvest to pay for the evac. Harvest takes 10 seconds to cast, and stuns me for 10 seconds. So, if I had to use harvest to pay for my evac, and considering a second or two as spells un-grey, it would take me 30 seconds to cast my evac.<P>Ok, now stop and think of where we evac to. If I evac in guk, the closest place would be south ro. not too bad, but its still a short walk back.<P>In Kunark dungeons(like karnors), I could evac to skyfire.. but no group would ever take me again. I could evac to Emerald jungle, then teleport everyone back to dreadlands for a long run back to karnors(this would take around 20 minutes for all the zoneing and walking. I could evac to another continent, and teleport the group back to dreadlands, but its the same situation.<P>If I cast evac in dalnir.... it would be a LONG walk back because there is no evac, or any other teleport spot near that dungeon.(duh, perhaps one reason why people rarely go there?)<P>Droga, howlingstones, Permafrost, Runnyeye, unrest, kedgekeep, and plenty of other dungeons are a long walk from the nearest wizard teleport pad, making evac a bad idea.<P>Evac from hate or sky? Never.<P>Evac is only used in 2 dungeons.<BR>Sebilis, evac to Emerald Jungle.<BR>The Hole, Evac to South Ro, then teleport to tox.<P>You would think City of Mist would evac to Emerald Jungle, but that spell can only be cast in a kunark dungeon. City of Mist IS a dungeon, but the game has it labled as a City, so the spell does not work there.<P>The wizards teleports can be a nice means of transportation depending on where you want to go. When I was under level 45, and I wanted to go to Firiona Vie, I took the boat instead of having to run agross dreadlands. The boat is much safer.<P>The "Evacuate" spell is pretty close to what we need, but there are some huge problems with it. First being that its level 57. If we are evacers, then we need that spell at levels 34+. Not to mention that is spell keeps the group in the same zone and rarely clears their agro(causing a train). Oh, and in some zones the landing spot is right next to spawn points.<P>If we are meant to only do two things as you say, evacuate and damage, then why are our evacuate spells so awful?<P>Evacuate spells should be MADE for dungeons. Here is what an Evacuate spell SHOULD be:<P>Evacuate: Karnor<BR>Level 44<BR>Mana 300<BR>Casting time 9.0 seconds<BR>Effect: This spell teleports the group to a spot in dreadlands right inside the entrance to karnors castle.<BR>Limitations: This spell can ONLY be cast in the Karnors castle zone.<P>THERE! this would be perfect! This spell could not be used for transportation, but would be a perfect evacuate! if wizards had these kind of spells, then groups would LOOOOVE us. Groups might actualy take a wizard over a cleric!<P>NOTE: druids are supposedly the masters of "Travel" so they would NOT get these spells. Wizards as the masters of "Evacuating" so we would be the only ones to get these spells.<P>There would be an evacuate spell for every dungeon in the game, and we would get it at the appropriate level.<P>Example:<P>Evacuate: Crushbone<BR>Level 8<BR>Mana 75<BR>Casting time 9.0 seconds<BR>Effect: Teleports group to a spot in Greater Faydark inside the tunnel that zones into Crushbone.<P>Evacuate: Unrest<BR>Level 16<P>Evacuate: Gukupper<BR>Level 16<P>Evacuate: Guklower<BR>Level 39<P>Evacuate: Sebilis<BR>Level 49<P>For the love of god this is such a great idea. This would be alot more spells to add, (one for every dungeon) but it would be PERFECT. This would make wizards VALUABLE to a group, and our class description would not change. We would remain just the masters of damage and evacuations.<P>Once again, I want to stress that druids would NOT get these spells or anything like them. I will even go as far as to say change all our current group teleports and evacuate spells into these new dungeon evacs. let druids teleport people across the world, and be the masters of travel. Wizards would just get our self teleports, and we would be the masters of evacuation.<P>Synra CrimsonScale<BR>53 Channeler<BR>Xev</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Balance issues:<P>Harvest, increased mana regeneration, spell efficiency: All the same thing.  Do we contribute enough damage to justify our role in the group?  We contribute damage at a relatively constant rate determined by our damage/mana ratio and our mana/time ratio.  If you look into this, you'll have to do your own testing.<P>Our group role is converting our mana into damage dealt.  If it is found that we don't do enough to contribute as a group damage dealer, then we need a melee-range damage spell with greatly increased efficiency.  (Melee range because our efficiency is adequate for kiting.)<P>Percent damage: This causes agro problems.  Go with the melee-range nukes instead, or make it possible to med during the fight against Velius mobs.<P>Lures: These were changed so that we can hardly hit anything with them unless we're 58-60th level.<P>Wizard resists 35+: This was a highly publicized change to help wizards contribute to group play without excessive resists.  Check the patch message logs.  I am convinced our spells are more effective against resists.<P>---------------------------------------<BR>Specific case problems:<P>Flaming Sword of Xuzl: I always liked this idea, personally.  The thing needs adjustment, as it's not at all effective now.  It needs more HP, decent resists, and it could proc steelskin on itself, allowing some randomness in its survivability.  Perhaps it should be given to enchanters, since it is an animated sword and doesn't take commands, similar to their pets.<P>Rain Spells: I can confirm that I have noticed much higher resist rates against rains throughout my career.  <P>Al'Kabor: Increased targets would make this useful.  Mainly against greens, but being able to deal with them is important.<P>51+ spells fizzle too much, in general, as you noted previously.  This doesn't need to be listed separately for each spell.<P>Invisibility to Undead:  I want to keep this spell, badly, but it is would be fair to take it away.  But you're not compelled to.  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>AE snare: Yes, we should have ae snare, period.  We used it and benefited from the AE greatly long before we developed quad kiting strategies.  For mana efficiency, I would like to get a single target snare, in addition, but I can live without it.  Of note, our snare has a much shorter duration than a ranger's, but we would damage ranger group desirability if we have single target snare.<P>Teleport - West Karana:  Please allow the 49 evac - WK to drop near the qeynos hills without any changes to the graphics.  Allow druids to land in Surefall without any graphics changes.<P>Teleport - Cazic Thule gate: I would make the "commons" gate lower level, and cazic higher, but I'd like to add that the cazic thule zone could use an overhaul.  You could fix the wrong-way tunnels at the entrance, and fix the geometry of the wiz port itself.  There's something funny about it; you can't hardly stand on the thing, and you land off to the left of the portal most of the time, although I have landed on top of the portal, too.<P>Teleport - Skyfire evac: Oh, please, please, do something, ANYTHING with this.<P>Kunark evac from dungeons only: I'd like to drop that restriction.  <P>Melee range only: I'd like lures to be able to hit from outside melee range, as they once did.<P>Evacs take LD members:  I really think the way LD players become NPC's is bad, because they can't be healed, they fight back and chase running mobs, they KS the party, they can't be evac'ed.  And in PvP people intentionally go LD so they can fight as NPC's and be more powerful.  It might benefit someone who goes LD while soloing, but it makes it very hard on groups.<P>Melee-proof NPC's:  Well, you can be a lot more creative than "tough npc=lots of HP and immune to magic."  There are some encounters where the NPC is "melee-proof."  <BR>For example, in order to kill VS, you have to prevent him from ever hitting anyone in the raid party.  Wizards dealing fast damage is only a part of that strategy.  Also some mobs are so hard-hitting that you need to blast them.  But in all those encounters, you need lots of melee people contributing.  <BR>In raid parties, in general, the low/mid-50's wizard is OFTEN are unable to contribute AT ALL.  Most classes can do something, but all we do is keep getting resisted while casting lures.  That's very frustrating.  Seriously, we know it's going to be resisted but we cast anyway because there's nothing else for us to do.  <BR>Making melee-proof mobs is a way to share our frustrations with others, but that's the wrong way to go.<P>Quad Kiting: Try it.  It's not so easy as you might think, and it's nearly impossible to find the right creatures to pull in the first place.  It's fun.  It's an accomplishment.  If you get good at it, you can benefit, but I don't think it rivals powerleveling or any sort of exploit.  I won't cry if it is nerfed by reducing the cast range of the snare AE, but I think it should be left alone for wizards.  I have saved my party by snaring a whole gang of mobs as we ran away, so I don't want this nerfed because of the affect on non-quad kite activities.<P>Suppression spells: (Anti-summoning) I like this idea.  We should be able to provide unique forms of defense against enemy magics.  However, this would allow us to kite 51+ mobs.  But we need this protection so we can med during raids.  And what happens if the mob tries to summon you and can't?  Does it forget you and attack someone else?  Run over to you?  I just don't think we can make this idea work out.  Instead, just lower the agro of sitting to med.<P>Blink spells:  This is exceptionally cool, but you do realize this would probably only be useful for soloing and outdoor kiting, only.  I like it, but our balance problem is our low damage output in a group.  If we blink to the other side of the same mob, still in melee range, then it would be good for groups and raids.<P>Concussion: I'd like to make this unresistable.  The only time it doesn't work is on mobs we have trouble casting on anyway, and we have enough limitations against those mobs that this would be a reasonable balance.  This is a raid-encounter enhancement request.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 13 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;7&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-8.html">8</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-9.html">9</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-10.html">10</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-11.html">11</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-12.html">12</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum12/HTML/000784-13.html">13</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000784&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum12&number=12&thisthread=000784&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
