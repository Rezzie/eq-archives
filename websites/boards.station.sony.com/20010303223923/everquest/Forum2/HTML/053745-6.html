</FONT><HR>Er, I hafta say I agree with Steevin, we don't need taunt, Our songs are taunt enough. if I'm not playing with an excellent taunter, chances are my song twists are gonna get the monsters all over me.<P>However, If our melee skills aren't improved much, I don't see any reason not to give us bind. Sure, we wear plate. So do Clerics. BTW, Yes, I have friends, but I don't like to yell at them to waste thier precious time and run across 3 or 4 different zones to bind me. Heck, I think all classes should have some way to get themselves bound independently.<P>On the subject of Snare, to rebut Steevin, No-one is asking to Snare like a druid. We aren't asking for the song to last all battle like druid snares do. You mention a playing a Bard takes rythm and timing. THAT, my friend, is the current problem with Snare, You CANNOT use Rythm and timing with it because it could break at ANY Second. A Fixed duration would help us perform better at using it. Just max it's current max duration it's fixed duration. No other power boost needed, except perhaps making it still stop Greenies (And only Greenies) at 50% health.<P>Also, with Twisting. First of all, Verant next planned for twisting from what I've gathered. I guess they figured singing one song for a long period would be enough. Myself, I'm lucky. My hands are decently healthy and I don't have CTS, despite playing a bard for 42 levels now. HOWEVER, I have friends who play bards who DO have CTS. One friend of mine switched to warrior because he was tired of soaking his hand in water to regain feeling in it after it went numb from a night of twisting. The Problem is real, and I think some way to make twisting easier would not be amiss.<P>My Personal favorite: An Ability called "symphony" perhaps, that could be turn on and off. With Symphony on, you could just click on a song gem, it would start and go grey. You could click on 3 song gems this way, and all 3 would play. If you clicked on a 4th, the 1st gem you clicked would ungrey and that song would stop. This would be especially nice for regenning health/mana in downtime. Then, if you felt it would be better to be able to manually twist (As I probably would if I was the main mezzer/Crowdcontrol/Snarer), you could just keep the symphony ability off.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Bards are difficult to play.  This is a good thing.<P>There are fewer Bards because they are difficult to play.  This is also a good thing.<P>Twisting well, and twisting the RIGHT combination of songs for changing circumstances, is a mark of pride among good bards.<P>There are definitely issues that need addressing, but twisting is not one of them.<P>Chains:  this is one of them. Even a minimum duration of 3 seconds would be fine, as you could snare a MOB reliably (except resists) by making it the only thing you are doing.<P>Defense:  My Bard's surname is "Manydeaths" for a reason.  Yes, we CAN use a few extra points of defense... I wish I had a dime for every time the party cleric has sent me a tell (while I wait for Rez) that says "sorry, man, by the time I realized you were being beat on, I couldn't get my heal off before you were dead, and the heal took effect on your dead body half a second after you died".  A few points of defense cap would have made the difference in those situations.<P>Haste stacking:  Heck, I'd settle for just BUFF stacking... any little opportunity to do more for the party.<P>49 song:  yup, needs fixed.  a 20 point symbol?  Inadequate at the level it is obtained.  Perhaps a more liberal formula that scaled it from 30 points at 49th to 60 points at 60th?<P>Role in raids:  This is one place where our manasong works to our advantage.  Do we LIKE singing manasong for a caster group?  No.  Does it guarantee us a spot on most raids? Yes.  I hate this song, but it is already the answer on this particular issue.<P>Mana regen rates:  I am forced to agree with Absor on this one-- It makes more sense to Lower the mana costs of our Dirge and Bellow (perhaps raising their damage, in the bargain), than to increase mana regen rates, which also affects charm useage.<P>--Stoney<BR>-De Oppresso Liber<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hello all,<BR>  I am a L51 bard on Lanys. I quit a few months ago to start up a necromancer. It has been fun but my true love of classes was the bard. Since the penalty has been removed, which was one the reasons I quit playing him, I am looking forward to playing again. I like what I see in this class balance thread so I am hoping the second reason for my leaving can also be resolved.<P>Here are my issues and I am positive these have all been mentioned in one form or another but I want to put them into my own words and bump the thread.<P>1. Allow our slow and speed songs stack. Why not? Is it unbalancing? not even! I invite anyone to to go to ANY server and do a / who bard 50 60 and see how many you come up with. Most times you will see less than 20, I know my server has less that a couple dozen. Even the old servers probably have less than 3 dozen. Now lets say that is 20 of 2000 on Lanys. That is less that 1% of the server population and that is if they are all on at the same time which is a rarity. Having said this with so few high level bards allowing our songs to stack with slows and speeds is not unbalancing. Hell even if you change this it wont make a ton of players make a bard to 50+<P>2. Our songs dam near overwrite everything. I was just wondering what the other bards thought of having the enchanter mezz line overwrite ours. I know there have been plenty of times when if I could just help our enchanter by mezzing a couple then they could cast over it and allow me to do other things instead of waiting for mine to break and get pounded, just a thought.<P>3. Our melee is right where it should be, we do not contribute that way. I am ok with our melee it is the defensive skills I would like to see get bumped a bit and perhaps get parry and riposte sooner.<P><BR>Thanks for your time , /bump<P>just to re iterate the change I most want to see is the stacking of slows and speeds with our songs. That would make our class so much more wanted than the occasional mezzer and all the time mana battery.<P><BR>Javis Bladesong<BR>Minstrel of Lanys T'vyl<BR>Eclipse of Norrath</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Please tell me there are more changes coming to Bards.  I looked over the list, and many of the other classes got some wonderful changes.  Then you get the bards and one is forced to say What the......<BR>perhaps having the mana song at 20 will help some bards and others learn that it isn't the bards only role.  which could be nice.  Or it could make the problem worse.<BR>Either way, this still doesn't adress 99% of the posts made in our thread.  I can't fathom where this idea came from.  Did the tuning team just pull it out of the air?  I really hope Absor hasn't submitted his 'list' to the team yet.  Because this is the result... my lord.  Someone needs to write a huge honking post from Verant explaining exactly what it is that we as Bards are missing in your idea of class balancing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

A possible way to test this in the real world if that is a problem (as it was with the song locking bug) my suggestion would be to keep 1 song playing constantly, then time it so you can cancel the effect RIGHT when the effect would have repulsed.

</FONT><HR>  I think I speak for every bard post 50 when I say the following.<P>  If you deem it necessary, we are COMPLETELY WILLING to accept a nerf to charm kiting in our 30s and 40s if that is a reason to keep us from being useful post 50!<P>  It is the only method which we can solo and gain exp relatively fast, its fairly easy, and the only risk is going LD.  I'd play a bard all over again and I still wouldn't bother charm kiting much compared to how often I grouped, and there's a reason.  Grouping post 50 is the GOAL.<P>  Punishing bards for overly limited solo ability pre 50, by punishing abilities post 50, is totally unfair.  It is unfair to necros, it is unfair to bards.  As you put it being a third rate support class post 50 is a result of a necro's power pre-50.  An unfair penalty, considering the whole POINT of the pre-50 game is to GET to the post 50 game.  Everyone having a VIABLE reason to play post 50 should be the goal here, and that is how balance has always been defined in EQ.<P>  Trilian Soulwind<BR>*forever at 51* bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I have played my bard for over 200 days (played days) on the Rodcet Nife.  I am a level 56 bard who has spent numerous hours training bards in the techniques needed to survive and play a bard.<P>I would like to address some issues for the post 50 level bards.<P>I had always hoped someday to have the ability to use my songs to their fullest without the tremendously awkward methods your design of my class has imposed on us.<P>But you have ignored our complaints about the complexity of twisting songs.  Instead of level caps on skills and abilities if you had made a new skill for using multiple instrument based songs like the puretone discipline available at say level 35 or 40 with time increases as a bard advanced. This would have caused bards to stick with their characters longer (I know alot of bards give up our class when they get to somwhere around level 40). <P>Also, the number and types of quests except for the epic weapon are a joke.  Our instruments are a key to success but the increases attributed to instruments in the post 50 levels are wholly inadequate.  If some newer instruments were available with some impressive bonuses available thru quests had been implemented it would have solved alot of issues.<P>Haste without at least coming close to Enchanters speed bonus or adding some other bonus like AC, Strength or Dexterity isn't going to help.<P>Protection bonuses from our songs should be bumped up even more with level.<P>Our slowing songs should be increased to include a mana drain and or a lifetap of sufficient size to actually have an impact on post expansion mobs.  It would be nice to slow a mob and have the a 3 or 4 hp regen to group at the same time or regen mana at a similar rate for casters.<P>I know using songs like I described above would increase our agro status to mobs and we would require either better AC armor or defensive skills. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The best way to taunt an unengaged mob at this point is to time your attack with the enchanters mez so you get a few hits in and hopefully get the mobs attention long enough for the enchanter to complete casting.<P>If you are trying to taunt a mob off someone 7 seconds for 2 targeted taunt songs is not something you will have.<P>Think before you post with supposed knowledge on a subject.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Why only TWO changes to bards in Test when pallies/SKs and most other classes with the exception of Warriors get LOTS??? Are you ignoring us again or just lacking ideas on balance??<P>Some More ideas on balancing bards<P>1. UP our DODGE skill too! If defensive can be increased, no reason not to increase dodge.<P>2. Increase Bard Picklock to 200. Currently this skill at 100 is so useless, I wonder why we even have it not that one can Open ANYTHING at all with a 100 cap lockpick.<P>3. Set a 30-40 minute timer on Denon's Desparate Dirge instead of having it mana dependent. Hundreds of bards have said thousands of times that our mana regeneration rate is so pathetic that this song is virtually .. a waste.<P>4. Increase the haste % of our group haste buffs. Currently these are useless if an enchanter is around. We are group friendly, give us the tools to make us better at what we do.<P>5. IMPROVE our sucky disciplines darnit!<P>Bards only get 4 disciplines, with the LONGEST reuse times, and pretty mediocre to sucky effects compared to other classes. Example - Mend has 4-6 min recast time, others 15 mins. Our recast time is long and duration shorter.<P>If you DON'T believe me, take a look at what Paladins, SKs and Rangers got, and what crap you gave to us bards. BALANCE OUR DISCIPLINES!<P>Resistant & Fearless - EVERYONE has these!<P>Deftdance ...<P>What is the use of deftdance giving us dual weild when we already have dual weild, or are instrument playing at the time this is used? I don't see what would be wrong with increasing the duration of this to maybe 5 minutes, with a recast time of not more than half an hour. As it currently stands, 16 secs for 74 min recast makes this a totally useless discipline.<P>Puretone <P>Needs to be at least 5 mins with shorter recast time. See Equivalent Paladin disciplines - just lay out a table with the disciplines reuse time and how long it lasts, and bards come out DEAD last. That's not balance.<P>Please consider</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Many posters have addressed the issue of twisting in these threads, although Absor has not yet done so (please do!)  There seems to be an even split between posters who would like to see some kind of twisting 'aid' added, and those who hate the idea, saying that the ability to twist 'defines' a good bard.<P>I'm solidly in the 'Help us out a little with twisting' category.  I would love to have the ability to twist during downtime without keypounding. I also like the idea of a level-based 'symphony' that allows increasing numbers of songs to be twisted automatically during melee.<P>To those of you who feel like the ability to twist well manually 'defines a good bard', I must respectfully disagree.  I used to feel this way, but after 32 slow levels (I fool around too much to level fast  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> )I have to come in on the side of people who want to be able to walk away from the keyboard during downtime, or be able to make a comment during melee without destroying their rythym.  I've been told I twist well and effectively by party members, who then wonder why a bard - supposedly a garrulous performer -- never talks.  Twisting = never talking, or at least talking less.  Totally out of character for a bard, I think.<P>Further, the ability to twist effectively is enhanced or detracted from by many factors, including but not limited to:  <BR>    Client side machine speed - dependent on many factors also; <BR>    Connection speed or lag thereof (sorry, couldn't resist  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">) on both the client and server side;<BR>    Physical ability/disability such as hand/eye coordination; carpal tunnel syndrome (pre-existing or bard-created - remember, not all players are under 30 or physically fit, or just plain genetically lucky); or even a large variety of physical illness/handicaps, which could include Parkinson's, Cerebral Palsy, physical injury or disfigurement, etc.<P>Clearly, I think, the ability to effectively perform the 'defining ability' of the bard is completely out of the bard's hands in very many cases. To those who have earlier said "Then don't make a bard" I say "Pfui! Everquest is for everyone, not only the players with ubercomputers/DSL/superior genetic makeup."  There are certainly choices to be made at the startup screen and all of these factors must be taken into effect, but every player should have a reasonable chance to succeed in every class.<P>Therefore, please take to the Balancing Discussions a proposal to add some sort of twisting enhancement to the Bard class. Several very valid suggestions have been made by posters more articulate than I, and I would happily adopt any of them.<P>MacKay<BR>Xegony<P>P.S.

</FONT><HR>Hail!<P>I'll just add my voice, dunno if all's been said before, after all I don't get paid for reading through this =)<P>I'll compare concept of the bard shortly after release to some trends now.<P>At first, the bards songs all were unique in function, becoming more powerful over the time.<BR>Therefore, a bard at Level 50 has had 50 (well 49 =p) songs to choose from, none of them too weak due to the low level you gain it.<BR>But now, more and more "upgrade-songs" have been introduced, which, i think, does not fit to the class.<BR>e.g. the Cantana of Soothing is replaces by the Cantana of Replenishment. After 55 the first one is completely obsolete.<BR>I can only make a guess, but I think there is the same issue with the "Breeze Song" just introduced on test.<P>All in all, please do NOT do that. Give us some new, unique songs, or make them a little different, at least.<P>BTW.: A new song at 20 will REALLY help the class... its at its weakest from 20 to 25.

</FONT><HR>Two points:<P>First, the new level 20 "Breeze" song.  If you think of this as an independent move, then it makes good sense.  Bards from 20 to 25 are pathetic, and this would give them a lever to get into groups.  I can't fault that (although I can certainly fault the decision to give them the one ability bards don't want to be known for).<P>Main point: the new song does nothing, zero, zip, nada, to address any of the points raised in this thread as most critical to balancing the class.  If you want to balance the class, you need to make bards able to contribute to groups at all levels, in ways that they currently cannot.  There are a very limited number of ways you could achieve this:<BR>1) give them buffs that are worth using in a balanced group<BR>2) give them melee skills (and anti-taunt) that would let them function as effective damage-dealers<BR>3) give them hit points and defensive skills that would allow them to tank effectively.<BR>4) give them crowd control/debuff abilities that don't conflict with other, better classes<P>Personally, I favor #1 & #4.  Allow bard haste songs to stack with haste spells; reverse the stacking order of enthrall-type spells, so that bards can't overwrite long-duration mezzes but CAN help control mobs who resist the enchanter; give the stat buff songs effects that are comparable to what an enchanter, shaman, druid or cleric (or at least a ranger or paladin!) could do if they were spending 1/4 of their mana pool just to maintain buffs.<P>Nothing else that you do for bards will improve their basic situation -- except, perhaps, to recalibrate the usefulness of resistances, so that highest-level bards can be useful on raids again.  You can tweak the class, fix annoying bugs, even give us our drum animation -- but that won't help high-level bards be useful in groups that already have an enchanter or shaman, except in their already-stultifying role as group battery charger.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

I would say that 11th level would be a good time to get it, starting out it could allow 2 songs to be played at once.  When a new song is started make it turn off the first one and the effect end.  Or make it so that the player must turn off the first one themselves before started a different song.  Then have it get up to 3 songs at once at 20th level.  Then not have any further upgrades until 60th.  At 60th, let it twist 4 songs at a time.<P>Kentaris</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree that battle changes the needs for your song alot, so many of the suggestions for implimenting autotwisting wouldn't really work.  I do like the one that suggests you hit a song, and it sings till you stop with a max of 3.  When you want to stop a song, you simply hit the key to stop it just as now.  And of course, song effects die instantly to stop people from twisting six songs or more.  I'm sure that is some kind of coding nightmare, but from a gameplay standpoint it's the best answer I think.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>The best ideas for twisting, in my opinion, have been the posts suggesting that Bards be allowed to "turn on" 3 spell gems at a time, so the 3 songs just play until you want to change it.. (i.e. you playing a downtime mix, and a mob spawns, you just stop the 3 songs you are playing, and click on 3 new gems. If one of your songs is a short duration song like a chant, the other 2 songs just keep playing, and all you have to do is cast chant. )<P>Getting rid of missed notes on 200+ "instrument" skills would help greatly also.<P>That would solve all of the repeatitive action problems, and eliminate fatigue. <BR>For those Bards that feel that twisting in its current state is somehow a badge of honour, and dont want it changed due to some ego issue, <P>all I have to say is, get a little respect for those less fortunate than you are.<P>Aanani<BR>Paradigm<BR>Sol Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Cooms, I agree that the haste stacking issue needs to have something done.  I didn't mention it because it has been mention a number of times and everyone agrees that it is something that needs to be done.  <P>Autotwisting is something some bards argue against because they take pride in being able to time everything properly and twist well.  It does take alot of skill, but my fingers just hurt.  A autotwist that would simply allow you to turn on 3 spells at a time would not be hindering the ability of a bard to switch songs during a battle if you either have to hit 2 buttons (one to turn off one of the songs and then one to turn on the new song - the way I would prefer) or just one button (turning on the new song and off the first song started).  It would just mean that I may have to hit 5 or 6 buttons a battle instead of 30 or 40 to keep the twists up.<P>In other words, I agree with you.  Haste stacking needs something done.  Autotwist is nearer and dearer to me because I have a group of 4 other rl friends I group with usually. Our group consists of a Cleric, Rogue, SK, Monk, and my bard. Usually we are looking for a druid, wiz, or mage to fill up the group.  Because of this, I rarely have to deal with a shaman or enchanter in the party.<P>Thanks,<BR>Kentaris</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ro-kenn,<P>I should have been more specific -- I meant GROUP pathetic from 20 to 25.  <P>Yes, you can twist Hymn/Chords/DDD with lute/horn... but only outdoors.  You'd be insane to try it in Mistmoore, or Sol A, or Permafrost, or Unrest -- about the only dungeons available at that level.  And these are the levels when you should be learning how to work in a dungeon.<P>Even so, being able to do 5 damage/second while regenerating 1.5/second isn't that tremendous, given that you give up all hope of crowd control to do it, prevent anyone but the bard from tanking, and get a good start on your carpal tunnel syndrome by juggling instruments.  A 24 shaman casting Envenomed Breath and keeping Regen on the party can do almost as much AND have plenty of mana/melee left over for battles.<P>Were I Verant, I'd have used this new song slot to plug the gap between Anthem de Arms (10% haste at level 10) and Verses of Celerity (20% haste at level 36).  A song with, say, 15% haste and +10 AC would make a nice stop-gap, gaining in effectiveness as the other classes in your group move up the melee power curve.  (And, of course, that haste should stack with Ench/Shaman, but that's a separate issue...)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I agree with you that it would be nice to have something done with the twisting issue.  I have seen alot of good ideas (I espescially like the idea to be able to have 3 songs on non-stop).  But this is just not the largest concern out there.  When I am grouped with a chanter AND a shamman (which happens alot on guild raids) I am reduced to a second rate melee machine that can juice up the mana for the group.  I would feel alot more useful, and be ALOT more wanted in a group if my songs were either A) stackable  B) more in line with chanter/shaman buffs/debuffs</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Thoughts on issues from a 42nd-level bard - where (so I'm told) I'm meant to start hating my character... <P>Autotwisting - Not feasible the way most people have asked - click 3 gems, and what order do the songs go into rotation - order clicked, or based on the timing? the game has to know, has to be programmed for it - not as simple as it seems.  I'd suggest a command i.e. /twist 1 2 3 to twist the first 3 gems in order, and this would be great for letting me get a drink.<BR>Charm Kiting - I've done it a few times, almost got killed due to early breaks, resists - whattya mean I can't charmkite yellows and whites?!  I'd far rather drumdot them one at a time as I make faster exp that way.  Deadly dull, but effective.  Reducing the effectiveness of charm kiting is unnecessary; it's dull and ineffective (due to caps and higher level mana requirement)<BR>Song stacking, generally:  Selo's should augment SOW to its own level.  I hate having to follow someone walking just because they have SOW on.  Mez should stack UNDER enchanter mezzes, as many have said - otherwise we're a liability to ourselves and our enchanters.  Haste should either work fully on its own, or stack at 30-50%, or - and this is the revolutionary new concept - augment the PERCENTAGE INCREASE of any other spell active.  So a 45% haste spell with a 20% song would yield a 54% total haste <BR>(45% +0.2*(45%)) = 45% + 9% = 54%<BR>Which, all told, is going to make it marginally easier to reach the cap, make bards tangibly useful singing buff songs in a party with an enchanter or shaman, and not prove hugely unbalancing as would straight addition.  At higher levels the effect - up to the cap - would be even more noticeable and therefore desirable.<BR>Ervaj's: not that I have any of them, but from what I hear they do, and given proper haste stacking, these would need a serious reworking - nuff said there methinks.<BR>Weak levels: A bard's weak levels are not 20-25 - that's where kiting is becoming a viable technique, we finally get combat slows and debuffs which make melee parties love us even more, and we've only just received our invisibility song, which can be a lifesaver in dungeon downtime.  No, a bard's weak levels are (from what people are saying) about 45-50+... the weakest level otherwise is probably 11th - just before kiting time.<P>Others have said it, but I'll say it again - we don't need another mana song; at lower levels, casters don't do quite the disproportionate amount of damage so cranking the tanks is more effective - hell, even now I don't play manasong while fighting's going on (because the range sucks so much hehe), and when I can arrange it that never stops...  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>Sorry it's another monolithic post, but... well... we bards care a lot, right?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Kasreyn<BR>42nd level bard (yeah, none o' that 42nd song crap - I have more than that...)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR><BR>On Weak Levels:<P>I do not think 20-25 are weak levels at all.  Bards are premier healers; clerics don't get a *real* heal spell until 24, and druids/shamans until 29.  Bards are also great pullers, and crowd control with lullaby is pretty effective too (its not an AE mez, but it does allow you to melee at the same time).  You also have a nice haste at this point... a good AE slow, and the regeneration is monster big.<P>A low level mana song is nice... but these are not a weak area.  <P>----<P>The weak area for bards is 45+.  This is mainly caused by a couple things:<P>1) Caster spells become more efficient.  <P>A level 20 shaman struggles to do anything if he is buffing.  A level 50 shaman can drop a ton of buffs, heal, and debuff.  <P><BR>2) Caster spells get better non-linearly.<P>A level 39/40 buff is generally more than twice as good as a level 19/20 buff.  Bard songs at best progress linearly.   Relative effectiveness drops behind over time.<P>3) An emphasis on multi-group tactics<P>Lots of dungeons are designed in such a way as to require multi-groups; where bard buffs are group only.  This causes bards to be less useful than other, more flexible, casters.<P><BR>4) Post 50, other classes get better non-linearly<P>Lets face it, a level 55 warrior is more than 10% more effective than a level 50 warrior.  10 level 50's warriors are not the equivilant of 9 level 55 warriors.<P>On the other hand, 10 level 50 bards are probably *better* than 9 level 55 bards.  That's one more mana song to begin with... buffs and debuffs are about the same, and its one more guy hitting on something.<P>For example, my feeling is most raids would be indifferent between a level 50 bard and a level 55.  They would not be indifferent between two characters of any other class.<P>SOLUTIONS:<BR>- Have all bard songs take step increases at certain levels (40, 45, 50, 51-60) in addition to the current increases.  This takes care of the non-linearity of other casters and should be designed to keep bards in the same position relative to other casters.<P>- Have 'combo' songs that reflect the fact that caster spells get more efficient.  This is already the case with many of the 50+ songs... they just need to be modified to keep the resistances the same as the two individual effects.  This is the equivilant of giving bards the ability to twist more songs.<P>SPECIFIC GRUDGES:<BR>Ervaj - make these singing so bards can use weapons at the same time.  The (a) loss of damage from a bard and (b) the opportunity cost of a loss of a different song, is just to high right now to make these useful.<P>Highsun/Midnight - make these ususable all of the time. They are good, but not overpowered in any way relative to other caster abilties.  Having them useless 50% of the time makes them so unreliable as to be worthless.<P>Meditation - Please increase this as bards go up in level (maybe make it available at level 1, and increase 2 pts per level.)<P>-----<P>These should not be major changes... they should be on par with adjusting paladin/SK hitpoints to be better, but not as good as warriors.<P>For example:<BR>If a bard haste is currently 30% at 50, and a enchanter is 50%... maybe the bard one should be moved to 40%.  They don't stack, so no issues.  No balance issues (chanter ones are still better).  Groups with a chanter are still going to use the chanter ones (they are still clearly better); but bards are still more useful to groups.  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">
