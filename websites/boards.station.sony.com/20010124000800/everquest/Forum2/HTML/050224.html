</FONT><HR>A line of new weapons that can ONLY be wielded by pets, kinda like how the muzzle can only be used by pets. I can think of 4 different swords in this line that would be nice but they should probably all be 51+ summons. Ask any mage over 51 and they'll tell you that out pets get signifcantly weaker COMPARED to the progression of the other classes' power and RELATED to the difficulty and amount of hitpoints that all the mobs you'll be fighting in the higher levels have. If you don't want to make our pets progress like they did in the pre 50 levels to keep up with the mobs and other classes then at least you could give us some summons that would spice up the diversity of the pets in these levels.<BR>Basically they would be pet only wieldable weapons with different utility procs on them. Here are my four suggestions.<P>1) A sword that procs a self damage shield. Probably lava shield but if you wanted to make it a level 57 summon then go ahead and make it cadeau of flame. This is in no way overpowering since the mage can already cast this on his pet. Just saves some mana and some hassel. And since it's a proc it's not like it's even very reliable.<P>2) I was first thinking of a snare sword but that would be a bit too powerful so i think it would be better to use the weakest version of snare out there. I'm no expert on the different snare spells but the lowest level necro darkness spell would be a good contender. Very weak movement slow down rate and a small amount of damage but still better than nothing.<P>3) A slow proc. Pure and simple. A weak slow, not to be anywhere near equal to shaman or enchanter slow but maybe 15-20%. Just so that the mage can throw the group a bone in the event that it doesn't have a real slower.<P>4) A weak level tashan spell. Maybe one that does -20 to all resists. This would also be nice as a taunt spell.<P>At first glace this might seem like a bit much but let me add this. First of all, these are procs which if you haven't noticed don't go off too often in the hands of a pet anymore since that fix. Second, they in no way step on the toes of any other classes since they are extremely obsolete to the spells that are currently used by those classes at those levels.(simply adding a pinch of utility to mage pets incase your group is lacking one of these functions but in no way shape or form a substitute for them) And third, something has really got to be done about our 51+ pets. No, really, something has got to be done. Our pets become powerful at level 49 following a fairly consistant rate of advancement but then in the final 10 levels of the game, the 10 hardest levels of the game, they are simply given a few more levels. Meanwhile melee classes are getting weapons that let them hit for 2 and 3 times what they could before kunark came out and we're fighting mobs that 200% and 300% harder than the ones we were fighting at level 49 while our pets get about a 10-15% boost in power. If the mobs i'm fighting have about 4 or 5 times the amount of hitpoints as the ones i was fighting at level 49 then why should my pets only have about 5% more hitpoints than the ones i summoned at level 49? If you check it out you'll find my numbers are pretty acurate.<P>Like i said, i don't care if you don't want to buff our 51+ pets to a respectable level but at least give them a whole new angle while keeping with the theme of the class.<P>(PS - 54 water pet excluded from rant about pets but should still have more hitpoints)<P>-Thank you  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>BTW, when i said that they in no way step on the toes of the other classes i should have that they don't do so any more than a monk being able to right click a level 55 mage spell and summon throwing stars or a bard, cleric, and shaman being about to summon food and water or a ranger being about to right click himself some arrows, or anybody in the world being able to summon bandages with that dagger etc, etc...... <P>And seriously, please check out the progression of those pets. Compare the difference of the level 39, 44, and 49 pets to the difference of the 49, low 50's, and high 50's pets.<P>If i had to rate the pets' power between 1 and 100 in those levels it would be something like this:<P>39 pets *40 power<BR>44 pets *65 power<BR>49 pets *95 power<BR>low 50's pets *97 power<BR>high 50's pets *100 power<P>There's something seriously wrong with that power curve.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

And while i'm on that subject does the shard of the core add those resists to pets if given to them?  And if so how about a second one with +15 to fire and disease and a third with +15 to magic.

</FONT><HR>A ton of good ideas are allready in post so ill just put the best of my own   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>-The ability to summon an improved eye.<P>-The ability to summon both the eye and a pet.<P>-(COOL IDEA)The ability to register a favourite name for pet.  At level X a mage can petition for a unique name for pet thats used when an item X is in hand.  "Chamois summons SuperJobaber" comes to mind  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  All naming policy rules apply.  Can only be changed via some wacked out quest. (if we can't talk thru our pets we shd have the right to name them! )<P>-(BEST IDEA)While the summon mob idea wld be overkill   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">, a taunt mob from afar wld be great.  Somehow this spell would aggro the mob yet keep a neat pathing towards the mage, as if the mage were running to where ever he is.  Its all to common to aggro from far and then outrun mob to hve to find him again.  A practical spell that wld allow the mage to med more than he wld if he were out pulling.  ( yes mages make great pullers) This spell would also be useful in redirecting aggro to the mage within a battle.  No dmg is necessary, but wld be nice.<P>-Summon a weapon that wld help pets do more dmg<P>-Summon armour for pet.<P>-Some kind of pet buff, Summon item x for pet. Our pets in the 50s aren't as significant vs the uber mobs we have to battle as they used to be pre-50s.  Tons of items have made the melee classes much better, this is good.  The downside is that it has diminished the relative power of tanking that mages once had.  aka we are not as good tanks anymore in comparison to the powertanks.  If we would have to quest hard or find odd items to make pets more appropriate that would be fair as tanks have to do the same.  (thank u for epic but thats just ONE item and its insane to get, and tanks have their own epic so this doesnt count)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here's a paste of an Idea I posted on a sister thread at the Mage Compendium boards which can be found here:<P>http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessage?topicID=1230.topic<P>This is just one of my ideas, forgive me if something similar has already been posted since I just woke up and didn't have time to read all the previous messages here.<P>--------------------<P>Extra said: "If mages would have a summon that improves out grouping ability drastically so that we are wanted in groups, I'd be happy to see"<P>And that made me think of this idea.<P>A NEW pet summon line.<P>Elemental:Plasma (or Summon Monster line, as noted at the end of the post)<P>This pet would be the exact same as the others as far as level and damage output. The difference would be that it casts an appropiate heal spell for it's level. BUT, it will only "proc" this spell on a random group member, never you and only during battle. <P>It would therefore be useless in solo situations yet give a healer a boost in a group.<P>Advantages: The random heals during battle would be like having a bard play his healing song during battle.<P>Disadvantages: Less damage output with no damage spells, and it never heals you. (to avoid making us too powerful in solo play)<P>As for coding, it might be tough, I don't know, but that's Verant's problem  <P>The other problem I see verant having with this is that they problably don't have a new pet image to use, SO...how about making the Summon Monster spell a bit more useful and have the new monster be those?<P>Ascii the Sleepy<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Ok... I'll bite...<P>I don't think alot of the things suggested here will ever be seen in game... but I was one of the ones that suggested Pet only heals a couple of years ago... never thought I would see that and we got it.. so.. what the heck.<P>I will leave level up to you for any of these suggestions... I dont worry about balance.. just effect.<P>Regroup:<P>Summons all party members to you reguardless of what zone they may be in.  This doesnt affect agro so if the monsters are still in the same zone as you they will make a be-line to your spot.  (This is sort of the reverse of an Evac.)(Note:  some will say that this means a mage can summon a party straight into Negafens Lair. I say.. if a lowly single mage can sneak into negafens lair and get this spell off before he is crushed into pulp.. more power to him.)<P>The Phantom Armor:<P>This could be changed to make it far more usefull... for example...I summon phantom plate..which creates a small shield that fits in the ammo slot and has one charge of phantom plate.  The shield need not be worn to activate but if it is you look like you are wearing a full suit of plate.  The stone is tradable.  (This answers all the want to look cool in armor/regen stone/ac buff suggestions that have been already stated.<P>Summon Element:<P>This would require a component... uses up the component to summon a rentable ball of fire/air/water/earth that can be used in the making of various trade skills.  Platinum Flaming rings.  Gold airy bracelets.  Studded Earth Leather.. Watery Fine Plate... etc.<P>Summon Gate:<P>This is probably a stretch.  Requires a component.  Summons a stone with 1 charge of gate.<P><BR>Summon Djinn:<P>Fire Djinn:  Attacks.  Has 1hp but anything that hits it takes a whole wack of damage before it dies.<P>Air Djinn:  Attacks.  Has miniscule hp... but 1000AC<P>Water Djinn:  Does not attack.  Has 1hp but casts minor healing spells on you.<P>Earth Djinn:  Does not attack.  Has massive taunt and HP, crappy AC (its a wall).  All it does is try to keep itself between you and whatever is trying to kill you.<P>Summon Plane:<P>Self only.  Requires a component.  Summons the mage to the plane of air.  (Have one for fire, water and earth as well.. should we ever get those planes.)  No... we will never have Hate, Fear.. etc.  Not our bag.  Leave those to wizards.<P>Summon Wrath of the Elements:<P>Large area conjuration POC DD.  Does 10x (5x,3x whatever) the casters current HP of damage to all NPCs in the area of effect.  Kills the caster.  Very high level spell.  (I may be going down but I am taking you with me.)<P>Food for thought.<P>Morgan.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>On summon spells.<P>I know we should not talk about summoning items other classes get. But Other classes can summon, either as a spell or via a right click item, items that mages can (rangers-arrows, Paladins-weapon, Just about anyone -food and water). I mean, thats a bit of a limitation other classes don't face.<P>Not on to the constructive.<P>Summoned Crown Pure caster only all all AC 5 +5 all resistences No Rent<P>Summoned Whip - Basically a pet only Gnoll hide lariat, including stun proc. Not lore.<P>Summoned Zone - Mage TP.<BR>(off topic here, what about a Bind2 and a Gate2? Letting a mage set dual bind points, and the ability to gate between them? I'd go for that instead of port capabilities)<P>Summons Shock Staff - Mage only, carries 4 charges of Shock of Swords. Level 52 and higher<P>Summoned Bolt Staff - Like above, but with a bolt spell.<P>Rod of Modulation 2: More manna efficient, better rate of return.<P>Summon Boat: Heh heh not the zone boats, but boats like in zones, the small little canoe things.<P>Master Summoning: Summons a Dagger of symbols, a coldstone, a stack of bandages, food, and water. All in a 8 pocket dim pouch<P>Summon Pet: CoH for pet. Clears pet agro (makes pet not hate it's targeted mob) and does a /pet guard here at your side. Great for those running pets who take off of their own accord (yes it does happen).<P>Summon Shuriken: Just because<P>Summon Snowball: Able to be used as a pvp item, even on blue servers. only does 1 HP damage, with a range of 70. Make it lore, possibly. Used for having snowballs fights during downtimes.<P>Summon Slime Elemental =P same as water pet, but with Swarm type dot spell. Or how about a pet that casts slow?<P>CoH 2. Interzone PC summoning. Level 60.<P>Summon flying sword: A dot that is a sword that repeatedly does dive attacks on the mob.<P>Summon Avenger :  A no rent FA style sword.<P>Also, Shard of the core, if unchanged, should be the next upgrade to Coldstone. Ergo, it should go in ammo slot, and not range slot.<P>And PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE some seriously usable by mages weapon summons. I don't understand mage 2HB summons.

</FONT><HR>Ok first of all.  The idea of making magicians even more powerful makes me roll on the floor laughing out loud.  OK, maybe you might have something with the pets.  Here is what I think the reason why Verant hasn't had significant increases to pets (and also Wizard dds, but thats a seperate issue)<P>Verant doesn't like the idea of a lvl 59 Magician making a pet then soloing let's say Frenzy room in Guk, or some other room that gives you exp.... with JUST the pet.  Verant also doesn't like the idea of Magicians sicking their pet after someone in a duel or pvp server and going afk while their pet soloed the lvl 60 warrior.<P>THUS:  a new pet line (for magicians) and a new DD line (for wizards)<P>Neither work on mobs under ...51,  or players period.<BR>(Kebober tells you, "That foe is not worth my time, deal with it yourself."  PvM<BR>Kebober tells you, "Surely one as great as you doesn't need my help to kill insertplayernamehere."  PvP)<P>That way you don't nerf pvp and you still get the desired effects.<P>-- Quantuma Starfury lvl 51 Wizard who wishes he was a magician.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

More throwing weapons equippable by mages.<P>3. Bigger one hand pet weapons.  (better look on the pet if he is carrying two leg-chopper style swords.  maybe give sword of runes random look?)<P>4. Rings with random abilities. (elemental armour on the ring with random stats)<P>5. Summon Voice Box. (voice graft for pets?)<P><BR>What i am looking for is for things to enhance the class, not really overpower it.  I want nice new spells that do fun things, not really things that could effect balance.  While i think that the summon armour one would be neato, no chance of that happening.<P>With all that said, i still want elemental form, and no-one can give me a good reason why we can't have it.<P>-_Secias</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

If the spell was L51 it would probably have Lesser Conjuration &lt;element&gt; (L39 pet) as right clickable effect (20 seconds castingtime to make the magician not able to instantly summon another pet if his "real" pet died). This would be very helpful for corpse retrieval. I don't think it would be overpowered because no magician would summon a L39 if he had a malachite. 1 Malachit is 5 silver pieces.

</FONT><HR>Sorry about this Long post, Read it its interesting, And i THINK a VERY good Idea and "Orginal"<P>Please bear with me, Ive read some of the posts and well, I may say someones own idea, So easy<P>I want you guys to really think of Ideas, that would get us Mages into groups like in Guk and Solb, Beacuse not many people like mages<P>1st) Summon Heros Defence Aura: <BR>Like decoy pet, but may be a seperate pet its self. It shields you from any spells, As the pet takes the damage and has Weak HP. It is a defence pet, And sucks MOST of the Damage that things HIT and cast, Maybe not cast... It REDUCES the damage, Like shieldskin but we use a "Hero" to defend, Some damage is not all proctective and well the Pet or whatever gets hit and has very low HP. This will stop us from agro'ing the mobs SO much!<P>2) Mages need like errmm.. a more purpuse the the group, I mean a Necro can Fear and dot, and still have a creapy pet. But a mage just as a pet and nukes away. It would be GREAT to come out with a new ablity that makes mages into groups... Like erm... an spell that can be shared by a group, The mage can summon like a reflexion of the person of this charater. This has to be a high level spell so it can be valued, Maybe this spell can attack air, BEacuse he thinks someone is there.<P>3) Elemental Cry- I dont know why Wizards get to summon Ice spells and Druids get lightings, After all we are the Elements of the Earth, Wind, Water, Fire, Earth. Maybe we would be able to "summon" these powers to us! like join up the elements as a whole spell eg. Mix Wind with water and get a Rain storm with Hail. This is'nt a "Druid" spell or trying to divert attaention away from them.<BR>But as we can have pets of Elements why dont we be able to control them like Wind's watering Rage, Something like that. Lets call them the "Elemental Cry"<BR>It'll be cool if be can control the Elements!<BR>That way Mages can have more say... interesting spells too!! Most 1-50 names are very orginal and some of the Conjure spells are great, eg. Bolt of Flame. Sounds lame, Put some New Spells of the Elements and we come up with some interesting spells here! Some of these can be quests and long ones too!! Like a very long quest about Water and Fire and Vola you get a very cool spell...<P>What Im saying here, Mages need more Elemental stuff into it, I know the New Velious DOT spells, But it seems plain.<BR>Mages are the keepers of the Elements and try to make them into the Class they are, Then they can Summon almost everything in the game... =P<BR>The Damage and such can be your Own Idea, but quests for an Elemtal spell, sounds like some great QUEST!<BR>Fire into Wind: FireStrom <BR>Water into Wind Hailstrom<BR>Earth into Fite: Meators<BR>Water into Earth: Mud slide<P>These spells could do things like Root or stun does, Like Fire storm, Would make it aslo Weak agansit Ice and so. Haukstorm can slow the target down maybe, Meators Could have hit high and well, Make the spell less, Agro-able<BR>Mud slides could Slow, Blind a target.<BR>MAYBE these spells can just be DOT things...<BR>With diffrent Damages...<P>You get it? Maybe we can play our own Disaster master Role!!<BR>I Really turly LOVE this Idea, and if you could get it up, it would be great. Its fantasy right and more of your aporch you want the played to feel into the game, THIS will spice up the Mages Spell ranks...<BR>Make it a spell rank like BOLT or RAIN or those CONJURE spells.<BR>Call it the Elemental Cry, Beacuse an Mage can summon these things!!<P>I bet this will REALLY Clean things up the weakness of mages!<BR>and would make it interesting.<BR>Making with new spell Database is easy to do...<BR>Im not ask like the others for Artists to do somethings or some mayor Programming.<BR>Mages do have a downside beacuse of there spells... Improve it, And we'll see more mages in groups then Enchanters or Clerics...<BR>=P<P>Czarina<BR>Ec'i<P>PS: I find it VERY hard to get a group now... =(<BR>All the groups just want Tank, CLeric and Enchanter... =( *sniff*<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>How about...<P>More item like Coldstone, fit in Ammo slot and add some proces to the wielder (can be the pet or not).<BR>Item of Fire, Could maybe be a DD proc of around ~60pt dmg or maybe a 10sec dmgshield (that stack with other shields) for 30pt.<BR>Item of Water, add a healing to the wielder for around ~60p or maybe instead a low level slowspell.<BR>Item of Earth, add a ~30pt AE earthquake proc, or maybe just root.<BR>Item of Air, item that proc Jolt (that ranger evade spell), or maybe proc a ~60 point rune on the wielder, maybe even just the Airpet stun spell.<P>These would be usefull in groups.<P>What more fun can I think of.<P>How about more rage pets with some diffrence. Very fast casting time, down to 2sec and cost 100mana all of the pets have less than 10hp.<BR>Rage of Earth, will summon an earthpet that will try to use his root spell the first thing it does.<BR>Same with all the rest of the pets, it would give mages a little way to try and stun or root mobs, ofcourse we can't use them then we have other pets.<P>Coth2 Short range (~300ft) fast casting time 3sec.<BR>Coth3 Summon a groupmember from any zone, would be an extreme timesaver.<BR>Coth4 Summon any person that you have targeted (not just group members).<P>Mod Rod 2, unlimited charges.<P>More specialiced pets.<BR>Give us back our old firepet after 50, add monkclass to it.<BR>Put the Wizards pet at L55 or so.<BR>Make the Decoypet work as intended, if it had cast and proc a AE megatauntspell it would have been such a good and usefull pet that acctually could have made mages wanted in groups because it would have alowed for tactics with AE.<BR>Add some pet that do low dmg but instead cast slow and snare on the mob.<P>There are multiple items that would be usefull, that could add small but usefull effect like Hp regeneration and manaregeneration.<BR>The issue about it stepps on other classes is just stupid, why shouldn't we be able to get minor version of certain stuff. Wizards didn't have Manageneration before, now they have two ways to gain mana, they didn't even have snare from start. Necromancers couldn't mez or inflict cold dmg, now they can. Druids never had a pet before, now they have. Shamans never had illusiions before, now they have. Also add that half our summonings been added to differnt classes armor.<BR>You messed up the stepping on other classes toes long long ago. But anyways, the things I want to do is not to be able to do it myself, I am perfectly happy if I get a pet that would do the snaring for me, or a pet that did the slowing of a mobs for me, thats what pets are for a mage. In my dream our pets should be able to fullfill more or less all classes role in this game, ofcourse a real npc could do it alot better and don't have to depend on the limited controll of the pet. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hey Absor...<P>Well, first off, I play a 51st level mage and I can tell you that mages dont need very much.  <P>When I was 40, I remember looking at bristlebanes bundle (summons a bag of food) and thinkin, THAT SUCKS!! a bag of FOOD?  Lemme just say this, its 60 mana, and its a 10-slot no weight bag (yeah it poofs)  but that bag alone rocks  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> worth it...<P>Mages need the following...<P>1) summon a 1hb.  especially at lower levels.  I used my staffs for quite a while, and when i finally got a stein of moggok, I had a 1hb skill of like 5.  Not good at 20th level.   If it had some kind of effect, great.  if not.. still good to have.  <P>2) some kind of AE spell (not pb, not rain) later than level 12.  something...<P>3) One.. maybe 2 pet heals post 20.   If my 51 pet is unbuffed, its gonna cost me a lot less mana to kill/resummon it then to heal it.  If its buffed and I have lots of mana... why is my pet so hurt?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>4) We have beer and fireworks... what else could ya need?<P>5) Summon a Bind stone...  summon gate stones are an obvious impossibility, they already exist and shamans can sort of make them.  1 charge bind stones might help solve your problem of lack of melee bind points.   And give mages something that no one else has.  Im not sure how they would work, but its a thought.<P>6) eye and a pet at same time would be good.  <P>7) i like the CoH idea for pets.   should be around 24th level.    why?  cause thats when people start goin to places where runaway pets cause the death of the zone.<P>8) since druids get mana regen at 54, and we get a pet haste item, why not split the difference and give us a nodrop manaregen +4 (thats not much) at like 56?  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Im sure ill think of other stuff later.    Good luck and try not to make all those poor melees feel bad when you summon uber pets that can solo them. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Well there are allot of good ideas here and some really wacky ones. I'll try to post realistic and serious requests. Most I think should be fixes to current issues that plague our class.<P>1. Our current summon weapons are a joke, and need to be completely redone. The problem with weapons is that you don't want them to be better than what a person of that level can obtain by questing and or camping. But on the other hand if the weapons we get are not as good as what people currently have then no one will want them. So the level of the summon should be on par with weapons that are available to players of that level. Also I think that no matter what 99% of the weapons we make will just go to our pets. So another idea would be to make them pet only and give them procs of an appropriate level. I really like the idea of making weapons that proc effects such as stun, snare, and DDs. This may be overpowering except for the DDs. But we need something. Before the Sword of Runes nerf/fix my pet and other party members pets always were given them. Since the nerf/fix I have not summoned a single weapon. There is just no need since pets can dual wield without them. So with that one nerf/fix our weapons were made utterly useless.<P>2. Spell drops and component drops. I am finding it extremely difficult to find mage components and spell drops. Something is wrong and needs to be looked into. I hit 51 last night and still do not have my 49 water, air, or fire pet. And I hear that 54 water is next to impossible to get. I offer up 2k for 49 water pet in EC and have gotten 0 replies.<P>3. As for more summonable items we really need to stay focused on what we currently have and enhance it. Coldstones are very popular. Perhaps an upgrade with see invis would be good. Also lev rings with more charges and or longer duration would be nice. I am really against something that allows a melee class to bind and items that cast clarity and what not. That is going too far and not realistic.<P>4. The recall pet is a good idea. If we have the power to summon a player to us it makes since that we could do the same with our pets. With the terrible pathing that haunts most dungeons this allows us to keep our pets a bit more under control. I know they don't wish to add more commands to further our ability to command pets thus reducing the risk.<P>5. AoE rain spells. Mages and pets go hand in hand. A mage without a pet is like a Wizzy without any DD spells. We would both be useless. Making our pets absorb 1 round is a bug. Saying it is intentional is an insult to our intelligence. If his was designed to use 3 waves then it should hit for 3 waves. If you feel that is too much then make it 2 waves. If it is a bug you cannot fix then make it 4 waves to make up for the lost one. Giving us a spell that hit our pets and saying "well that's the downfall of using a pet" is laughable. That's like nerfing a shaman for buffing or a wizzy for using DDs. Our pet is our main ability and it cannot and should not be used as a scapegoat for a bug.<P>6. Mana regen. I know it wont happen but at the same time we are the only int class without any sort of mana regen. If this is not a feasible request then please post your reasoning behind this, I would love to read why you feel this outbalances mages. And don't use the you have pets to help save mana bit. Necros have great pets and have mana regen.<P>Well that's about it. I know I went beyond just summoning but these are the issues that plague our class. And with all the talk of balance then our class needs these issues looked into.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>THUMBS UP to Verant for finally realizing that the MAG class is LACKING:<P>1- Many of the posts here have much merit<P>2- Mages, like ALL the other casters classes, should have ROOT! If we get DoT's now everyone knows they are pointless w/o root and MANY times we cannot use a pet in & out of groups by request. This would also give us the defense option that all other casters PLUS have to evade a many times accidental incident. (training, etc)<P>3- The summoned bags should return items that ar NOT No Rent to empty slots at logging/LD.<P>4- Let us have spells, sumoning or/and otherwise that allows us to be more appealing to groups (that IS what Verant wants)<P>5- nikez post has GREAT ideas and I back up most of them.<P><BR>Thanks and GL all  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P><BR>Lindrax<BR>55 Conjurer<BR>Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I like some of the ideas that have been posted here already:<P>1) Absor you yourself suggested new weapons: New pet weapons with interesting procs.<BR>Something in the lines of snare, an all-target DD, an undead only DD, a slow target proc, a haste proc, a stun proc etc. I would really like to see this. Of course without making them so powerful that people of your level will be begging for them.<P>2) Armour and resist gear. Something along the lines of Dagger of Symbols, only it's jewelry. Maybe various pieces of armour (like the coldstone).<P>3) Can pets equip armour? I sometimes give crap armour to my pets instead of destroying, but I've never noticed any change. If pets can equip armour, can we make some, please?<P>4) Modulating Rod II - at post-50.<P>5) Pets that look cool. Necros get Spectre pets, why dont magicians get cool looking pets?<BR>Some good suggestions at:<BR>http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/045953.html<BR>by Tiffa-Lockheart.<P>6) I also like the idea about Shock Rods and Bolt Rods, make these Lore though.<P>7) Shurikens. "Because!"<P>8) 1 charge stones that cast Illusion: [insert element name here] Elemental on the user. 1 charge stones that cast invisibility on the user.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Summon a banker!!!!<P>Since mages will not get any summons to help them be more group friendly, at least make it easier in the soloing field!!!<P>This isnt a summon spell but i would like to see a spell line that is the reverse of damage shield, like a damage aura.  With this spell active on a character each time that character hits a mob it adds 5 points unresistable fire damage, not the same amount of damage as the equivalent level damage shield, maybe half, and it would not stack with the damage shield.  This would help magicians with groupability and live up to magicians only being able to deal or help deal out damage.  And this spell makes alot of sense, I dont see how a mob can touch your character and get burned, but your character touch the mob and no burning sensation???<P>I would also like to see summon popcorn, a very low calorie, fat free food item....<P>And maybe scoobie snacks....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Here are my suggestions:<P>1. Permanent summoned dimensional holes. Make them Lore AND NoDrop so they can't be handed out. The dropped/store bought weightless bags will still be more desirable because they typically have more slots. At high levels, the tinkers bag (I think) is a purchasable 8 (10?) slot weight remover.<P>2. Summoned weapons that are pet only or pet and mage only. For example:<BR>  Lvl 29: summon sword of flame. effect Burn<BR>          (14pt dd)<BR>  Lvl 34: summon stave of light: effect flash of <BR>          light (1hb)<BR>  Lvl 39: summon sword of shrapnel. effect shock <BR>          of blades (35pt dd)<BR>  Lvl 49: summon dagger of stunning. effect stun<BR>  Lvl 52: Summon sword of Lava. Effect flame <BR>          flux (AE 99pts) 2HS (no dual wield). <BR>  Lvl 60: summon stave of stillness. effect AE <BR>          stun (2hb so pet can't dual wield)<P>These aren't unbalancing, IMHO. The DD effects are sufficiently minor that they are really more for show than anything. The level 52 and 60 summons are very powerful but the trade off is that the pet loses its ability to dual wield.At those levels pet's loss of dual wield is a major drawback as Jabober hits for 45+s per fist.<P>Aquilistor<BR>36th (yay!) mage.

</FONT><HR>The weapon summonings we currently have are as follows:<P>Daggers at level:  1, 12 & 39<BR>Throwing Daggers at level:  16 & 54<BR>Staves at level:  8, 16, 24, 34<BR>Arrows at level:  20 & 53<BR>1HS at level:  29<BR>1HB at level:  44 & 46 (Epic)<BR>Shuriken at level:  55<P>We need some lower level 1HB summonings so we can practice our 1HB skills.<BR>Perhaps rods at levels:  4, 12, 20 & 29.<P>We need a summon 2HS spell.<P>A line of shield summoning spells for CR.<P>A line of tunic summoning spells for CR.<P>We definately need at least one upgrade to Renew Summoning; Renew Conjuration that heals 400-500 at the very least. Lets face it, in high level encounters the healers are gonna be healing the party members and not paying any attention to the health of the pets. The level 20 renewal spell just doesn't cut it even when chain cast.<P>The summon pet spell would be great for those zones where pets get lost or stuck alot. Or situations where your group moves and you forget to tell your pet to follow you. The spell should set the pet to follow automatically.<P>Also the "/pet as you were" command is not always clearing the pets hate list. On more than one occation I've used it on my pet after accidentally sending it after a wandering mob that crosses as I'm targeting what I really want to kill. After a while the mob wanders back and gets attacked by my pet, this is really irritating when it happens as you pull a blue mob and your pet has charged off to slaughter a green.<P>Fix Phantom Armor so it's not overwritten or will overwrite the Guard series of cleric spells. I'm getting tired of chewing out clerics who keep wiping out my Phantom Armor.<P>Fix the Shield line so the shaman talisman series doesn't wipe them out. No other classes HP Buff cancels out our shields, why does talisman do it? And while your at  it, fix the excessive casting times for Arch Shielding and Shield of the Magi, there is no reason for the 12 casting time, when you look at the time progression it should be 7 or 8 at the most. It's almost impossible to renew the spells before they wear off, once they start blinking, unless you catch it immediately. I've lost count of the times I've suddenly gone unprotected in the middle of a fight.<P>As to the Rains, what's the point of having an AE that is so limited, you're lucky to affect one critter? I can whack at least 8 critters with my PBAE spells, yet a rain is limited to 4 hits? Why not make it 8 hits so it becomes marginally useful. In my 54 level career, so far, I've used rains only twice, because they are so useless.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>-Summon Elemental Protector - A pet type spell where the pet encases the mob like a bubble.  While the mob is trapped inside this bubble it CANNOT move but it CAN attack the pet and once the pet dies the mob is set free.  Now, while the mob is trapped no one else can attack the mob or else the bubble will break and the mob will have FULL aggro on the mage.  this would be great for those situatinos where you need to run.<P>- how about summoning a no drop, lore shard that magician can latter charge with any spell in his inventory<P>- The summoned bags should return items that ar NOT No Rent to empty slots at logging/LD. If this game was "real" then you wouldn't go LD and when you camped you would be smart enough to take your items out of your summoned bags.... so why can't they just go back into our inventory?  if there are not enough spots then the last items that cannot fit are destroyed.<P>- Simple: Summon Earthstone. 2 charges of root.<BR>We have a coldstone, waterstone, and heatstone.

</FONT><HR>I kinda dislike the ideas of more weapon and armor summonings, because basicly they will never be used and therefor will not make us more wanted in groups. Verant have stated more than once that summoned weapons can't be as good as dropped weapons. So that means you will never see a weapon with the same stats as Lamentation, and with more and more epics even a weapon with the stat of Lamentation would be absolte after a few months.<BR>I rather see some item that would add a persons own ability. A ammoslot item made the wielder proc a Stun would be alot better than a Sword with so-so stats that proced the stun.<BR>If you could summon some item that instead of making the wielder cast a dmgspell it would proc a low-agro spell like Jolt it would be a very wanted items for Rogues, Rangers and Monks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hello. Bear with me as I had a late night at work and very little coffee  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Qualification: I don't understand the prohibition Absor placed upon our ideas to not (paraphrase): mimic magick used by other classes. I don't believe this is fair. Magician magick is spread willy-nilly through other Classes and on many new items which we cannot use ourselves. Absor, could you please explain this apparent contradiciton?<P>Anyway, my ideas:<P>What I've wanted from the beginning of my time playing this Class:<P>Wall/barrier conjurations: ie, wall of fire, earth, air and water. I don't know the coding involved or feasibility. I'd describe the effect like this: in a tunnel or corridor, the wall would create a panel of the appropriate element touching all four walls. It would have a HP total which could be eventually beaten through by attackers. It would have a damage shield effect causing appropriate damage to the attackers. It would have a duration. Outside, the wall would form a circle around the mage or even dome and have the same effect as I describe for the indoor situation. These spells could progress in power and ability, that is, become a series of spells over many levels. I'd gladly trade every single AE spell we get for something like this. Obviously, the ramifications and specifications of the walls/barriers would have to be carefully balanced--limited, etc. I'd have to leave all this to the LT.<P>Next: let's talk about weapons. Now, I want a healthy mix of stuff I can make for others and stuff I can make for myself  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"> I agree that the 2hb staffs should either be changed to 1hb or, we should get a new line of staffs or even wands that are 1hb. I could write reams to effects for wands/staves. Let me try to limit myself here:<P>wand/ring/staff of elemental strength: yes, that's right. A right click on this item would give me the strength of my current earth elemental. Similar, I suppose to the Necro siphon strength spell. As a Mage, my str stat is very low and I find myself encumbered almost all the time. And no, I will not use our conjured bags. Sorry--my momma didn't raise no fool!  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> I don't even have the spell scribed---I will not conjure these bags for anyone else, either. Bad spell! since the LD changes---very bad.<P>Conjure Elemental Armors: these ideas are very good and fit in nicely with our Class concept. So, it would go like this: we can summon various kinds of armor or even one kind that any class can wear with no penalty. We already conjure items that give AC--but they are either so miniscule they mean nothing or the embedded spell is far more important (cold stone, ring of flight--etc). Therefore, I propose a series of spells that produce some really nice protection with the addition of a damage shield that is either a right click or proc. Yes, include stat bonuses on it too, if you like. If the armors could show on the avatar, that would be a nice touch.<P>Damage Shields: ok, this is abjuration not conjuration. But think about it. Abjuration usually means you are conjuring energy rather than an object or creature. So I'm going to stretch Absor's topic a bit. Give us, please, a series of damage shields based on each element we can conjure/abjure! earth, air and water shields that do different things. If I had more time this morning (gotta head to work here soon!) I could write out some ideas on what each can do. Again, however, I'll have to leave this in the capable hands of the LT.<P>Now, what I've come up with (or echoed from others) are basically new concepts. If necessary, you guys should remove our more useless or questionable spells series to make room for the new: ie, AoE spells (all of them) and our self-AE's which are pretty much useless except for dealing with low greens, etc, ie, flame arc and that entire series.<P>More to come when I get home from work. Thanks for giving us this chance, Abs!<P>Alc<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor, <BR>I feel the previous posts about the summon armor spell are not what the mage class needs. This spell will be useful for levels 20-30 maybe, and will aid newbies. It however will have NO effect on the 50+ game, where the mage lacks and needs balancing. Pre-50 mages are fine, and balanced. Will summoned armor help on a CR in in a plane? No. Will it help recover corpses in Karnor's Castle? No (just two examples). It will in very limited ways aid the mage class post 50. I feel they should get different types of summons. My ideas are:<BR>) I believe mages should get a spell at level 50 that summons an item which, like a coldstone, goes into the range slot. This item will give +8 magic resist and has ONE charge of the effect "Elemental Fury" which lasts for 30 minutes after right clicking the item. This effect will be like Divine Might (it will stack with Divine Might) and add a procable damage spell paired with a short stun, or an effect along this line. This will aid in raids and will make the class a step higher towards the goal which is them being balanced post 50.<P>2) A spell called "Rage of the Element" which is a level 53 spell and castable ONLY on the mage's pet. This spell will take 500 mana to cost and have a recast time of 15 minutes. Once casted upon on the pet it will send him into a fury which somewhat resembles a dicipline. It grants the pet a HIGH amount of haste and UPS the pets strength and COMBAT SKILLS. After this brief period of rage the pet slashes itself for 32000 damage (what pets used to do when the mage zoned), making it a spell the mage would ONLY cast in group situations. With this spell paired with the previously metioned spell, it would balance out the 50+ game. <P>Could you please consider adding these two spells or similar spells and also maybe increasing the drop rate of "Muzzle of Mardu"? Thanks  please consider my post and tell me what you think.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
