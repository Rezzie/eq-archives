</FONT><HR>Another follow-up on this, the database does indeed indicate that the item hasn't been changed since February.  That leaves two possibilities, either there's something wrong with the field that's reporting the last date that it was changed, or there was some kind of export problem.  More info Monday.<P>Concerning items in combinable containers, I think that I'm going to chat with the programmers Monday and see if they can make the containers eat any items in them upon logoff/Linkdeath.  I think that there'd be no question of the intent of those bags then. <P>Also, I notice a couple of people have brought up a thread where I indicated that accidently pressing "Combine" was a risk of using them as a container for item storage.  That's true.  That is "a" risk, and that was brought up when people were asking for a confirmation window (yes/no requester) when combining.  Though that is "a" risk, I don't think that I ever indicated that it was an all-inclusive and balancing risk.<P>-Gordon<P><BR><p>[Note: This message has been edited by ubbadmin]

Besides, storing a stack of patterns in your sewing kit sounds reasonable to me (I do this all the time).<P>That having been said, I also use my large sewing kit as a garbage disposal.  My mage loots EVERYTHING from his victims when he solos, and then I just toss any crap loot in there and combine while I medd.

What about those people that have filled up their spaces and they that one other piece of loot that they were looking for or another pelt they wanted to use to raise that skill but didn't have the room?  Me i use my tailoring kit to carry my patterns around in and then when I've made the tattered armor I put it in my tailoring kit until I get to a tailor because I don't want to us eth eother bags up I have for the loot I get from the area I'm hunting in.  Have I accidently hit Combine? You bet I have, and I smack myself in the head for it too but that's my own fault.  Sometimes I forgot to sell those things in my tailoring kit before I log or I have to go and I have no time to get to a merchant.

</FONT><HR>Losing the complete contents of a combinable quest or skill item, which most of us use to store the actual quest and skill items, would be a SERIOUSLY bad decision.<P>Better suggestions:<P>1) Make sewing kits, toolboxes, quest containers, etc Lore, there is no reason to have multiple copies of them.<P>2) Make the sewing kits, toolboxes, etc weigh the same amount as a backpack, negating the benefit of using them for general storage.<P>3) Don't allow sewing kits, toolboxes, etc to hold oversized (ie Rebreather) items that wouldn't normally be placed into them for skill or quest purposes.<P>4) Put into the game more proper containers that are able to hold oversized (ie Rebreather) items, keeping the weight of the container so high as to discourage carrying it anywhere but in the bank.<P>And no matter what you decide, be sure to inform us all BEFORE you do it so you, the guides and GMs don't have to go through a CS nightmare afterwards dealing with all the missing gear, quest and skill items we worked hard to obtain.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Let's see:  I fletch (fletching kit), bake (mixing bowl & spit), and tailor (sewing kit).  That's four slots of sixteen that are occupied by containers with combine buttons.  I am well aware of the risk of storing stuff in these containers, so I generally put stuff like foraged food, water, etc in them.  But is it really reasonable to expect me to pay a 25% penalty in total available storage space just to pursue trade skills like I would with the new proposed nerf?  Yeah, that's what trade skills need in this game, another huge disincentive.  I mean, they're way overpowered as it stands.

</FONT><HR>Greetings Gordon<P>&gt; the database does indeed indicate that the item hasn't been changed since February. That leaves two possibilities, either there's something wrong with the field that's reporting the last date that it was changed, or there was some kind of export problem. <P>I can personally vouch for the fact that my 'Partisan Pack' has definitely switched from 10 items to 6 items quite recently.<P>Glad they fixed the bug.  I was quite confused on what to put in there.  Yes, I lost some items, but it's a rare situation.<P>&gt; Concerning items in combinable containers, I think that I'm going to chat with the programmers Monday and see if they can make the containers eat any items in them upon logoff/Linkdeath. <P>Heavens!! Please no.  <P>I'm an avid questor and have my bank completely full of quest items.  Making a container that I have actually eat the items is an unbelievably 'horrible' idea.  I can EASILY imagine putting my JBoots into my inventory and them accidentally going into a 'combine' style pack.  Just imagine how absolutely furious I would be if I went link-dead during a zoning?!  <P>Seriously now... Half way thru some quests such as the Rogue's Burning Rapier quest, you receive a ten-slot Box for Ale.  Of course, when you collect the bottles, you put them in the container where they are supposed to go.  Further on, you get a 'blackburrow cask' to put in gnoll skins as well.  I can't imagine the thinking that I would have to (for 3-4 weeks) take up TWO of my precious slots!!<P>Please, kill this horrendously bad knee-jerk idea immediately.<P>Vaslin Slickfinger<BR>Scout of Tunare<BR>Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Making combinable containers eat items would be an incredibly bad idea. I keep a mixing bowl, spit, and a large sewing kit one me. It takes at least one pack to hold the items needed to work the spit and then I need it empty anyway to use it. Ditto on the sewing kit. My other packs are usually full of foraged items and trade skills material. I hand out alot of foraged food in kunark as stores are NOT close. So now when I go LD in kunark, not rare, I will lose everything that defaulted to those slots? I dont think so. I guess I am out of the foraging and cooking business if this goes through. For those of you saying its easy to empty the containers. Most people in the middle of kunark who use trades dont want to run back n forth to the bank every day. I cant think of a bigger waste of time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

I think that there'd be no question of the intent of those bags then. <BR>---<BR>Let me add my voice to the growing numbers of those opposed to this idea. I cannot believe that such a suggestion was even made. The only purpose this could possibly serve is to punish a large number of players who, in my opinion, have done nothing wrong.<P>I have several objections to this.<P>First, there is no "reality" or RP sense to such a change. Say I purchase, in real life, a toolbox designed to hold hammers, nails, etc. If I decide to store my wallet in it overnight, my wallet will be there the next day. Sure, the toolbox wasn't designed for overnight wallet storage, but it will work. These containers are not magical in any way.<P>Second, I see no practical impact on game balance in allowing items to stay in combinable containers. I only see a couple of minor issues. Some combinable containers are slightly less weight than their equivalent non-combinable counterpart. I can save a couple of weight units by using a sewing kit instead of a backpack. There are a couple of containers that can be obtained for free by starting a newbie quest. These are usually lore, so the total impact is that the newbie who figures this out gets to save 5g or so over the cost of a backpack. Big deal!<P>Third, bank space and inventory space is already very precious to some of us. There are many many items in the world that cannot be used immediately or require additional items in order to properly use them or complete a quest. Other items are not appropriate for my class so I save them to give or sell to others. If one also participates in trade skills, they will have multiple combinable containers. I carry a fletching kit, sewing kit, and a mortar and pestle. If this change gets implemented, I will lose 22 slots of storage space. I carry all three of these, not because I am always practicing all threee skills, but so I can practice these skills as I come across the components. You state that you are opposed to camping and would prefer that people adventure and pick up what items and experience they may. Fewer storage slots are not in line with this vision. Now if I adventure and come across an item, I can hold it while I figure out what to do with it, even if it takes a long time. With reduced storage space, if I come across an item for a quest, I must decide either to destroy the item and not do the quest, or go do the rest of the quest RIGHT NOW.<P>Think about why people are using combinable containers for storage. I think the main reason is that we must have these containers for trade skills and certain quests, but we are not always working on those trade skills or quests. When not actively working on them, what are we supposed to do with the container that is taking up the valuable bank or inventory slot?<P>Please reconsider what I believe to be a decision not well thought out. But if you do decide to do this, I would add one suggestion: allow an empty combinable container to be placed inside of another container. If this were done, I could switch between trade skills "on the fly" without worry about losing items if I log out or go link dead.<P>--- Geffin Dagrifter<BR>Wealth Redistribution Engineer<BR>Level 40, E'ci<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>You have GOT to be kidding me...<BR>Granted, that using "kits" for storage *IS* a risk, but an acepted risk by the player. Nobody can complain, within reason, about losing items due to keeping them in a "kit" because again, that is an understood risk. But, to take that option away from the player seems at best, unnecessary. It would be like, putting a Confirmation window ON a confirmation window.<BR>My opinion is such, you have to let people make their own mistakes, and let them take their own risks. You goto PoF, you know the pathing there is horrid, but thats an accepted risk, as is putting items in "kits". To make those kits empty upon logout/linkdeath, is saddening. I happen to use mine for arrows. Others use their Lexicon's for their most prized runes. etc etc<BR>Inventory slots, at later levels, are VERY Valuable. And for anyone who wants to persue a trade skill or even just research their spells, you're taking inventory slots from them. =(<P>Just one man's opinion... in the great scheme of things...<P>-tekk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>  jewelery container has 4 slots.  I am a master jeweler maxed out in skill points.  Never have I read or even heard of any recipe calling for more than two items.  Gem and metal.  Nothing more.  Now, I happen to have stacks of metal stored in bank..in..you guessed it..my JEWELRY KIT.  Should I expect that somewhere along the line my 4 slot kit will then become a 2 slot kit?  No.  Should I realistically expect 2 of those slots to be deleted and all metal/gems in them gone?  no.  The kits (containers) have 4 slots when I bought them, I need the room. I'm gonna be careful..i'm gonna store stuff in them.  I see nothing wrong with doing the same with a quest bag as long as that bag happens to hold things other than quest items. <BR>   And fyi, their is a fire beetle eye quest in neriak with a box..a combinable container that holds 10 beetle eyes..and only beetle eyes.  THAT container was well thought out.  Quest items only.

</FONT><HR>Abashi, if you decide to have all items inside quest containers and kits dissappear at logoff/linkdeath please do two things. Any items that belong in that container (example spider silks in sewing kit) should stay. And when right clicking items during loot do not have them automatically go into those containers.<P>And while I'm on the subject of looting... why is it that when you have a full inventory and you right click something to auto-loot, it will not automatically stack. (Example: Your inventory is full and you have a 1/2 stack of batwings. If you right click a bat wing to loot it will not stack on to the 1/2 stack instad it says you do not have enough room in your inventory!)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>A few reason WHY this is a BAD idea.<P>#1 trade skills are money sinks.  Trade skill USE containers with "combine" buttons.<P>#2 may people that wish to follow the trades have multiple containers like this.  ie, sewing kit, jewlers kit, mixing bowl, fletching kit, the spit, reseach tombs etc. etc. etc.  there is one for nearly every trade skill or MORE then one.<P>#3 why do you wish to tell trades people that they are not allowed to have the same storage space as every one else?  Many trades folk already sacrifice vault space in order to keep the container needed for thier trades.  In some case they have had the same container since they started the trade skill.  I'd wager in mosst cases. <P>Yes people do get attached to those virtual items.  while the option to simply purchase the item exists in MOST case in some cases those container ( yes even for trades ) are quest container ( ie research tombs, the black burrow gnoll cask ).<P>#4 there is no game balance issue here. If there is Gordon please state what it is.<P>#5 if the issue stated is the WT of the container... simple up the wt yes it would po a lot of people still, but that would be the rational fix.<P>#6 Gordon if you push this request, I NEVER want to hear about the realism of feign death pulling again.  Because this nerf would be completely UNrealistic.  <P>#7 Planning on reimbursing that Black Saphire and that enchanted Plat bar?<P>#8 Planning of reimbursing any of the monk quest items?  You know the ones that 200 + hour to obtain.  Let's think about this.... you spend WEEKS of real time gathering for your Robe of the Lost Circle, you place everything in the container,  your ready... you hold your breath... YOUR LAG STARTS CLIMBING!!!!!   You hit combine desperately hoping that it gets through!!  You pray... you log back in... and ... nothing.  You petition.. the GM gives the same tired awnser you always expect, they can't help you that's the way the game is designed, so sorry.<P>My next action... log off, go cry.  Be completely discouraged.  Ask why I subject myself to this.<P>That goes for ANY difficult quest.  Treant Fists spring to mind... but hey I'm a monk.  If those items went poof after all that time all that waiting and all that effort,  just because of a bad connection,  because Gordon didn't like the idea of using combinable containgers to "Store" stuff... I'd be pretty royally po'ed.<P>Autumn Dawnfire<BR>Holder of the Treant Fists.<BR>Wielders of Justice, Sol Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

In another bag? Limiting your storage even more?  It is STANDARD practice in EQ to store items in COMBINE containers, because they are "BAGS" and can not be stored in bags, and there is such a crunch on space as it is.<P>Regaurdless lets assume the player ONLY had the quest items in the bag, and if they were like me they fill the bag from top to bottom left side then right side, meaning 2 of the items for the quest (Designed to be put IN the bag in question) would be lost by this nerf.<P>And you mentioned it hadn't been modified since February?

This would not create random item loss (Think PVP Weapon disarmed then LD and oh crud I just lost my bloodfire!).  I'm sorry but the concept of havin them EAT items is just silly and ill concieved, yet another way to punish the userbase for being creative with the resources available.<P>I'm disappointed in two issues here, one that a public relations employee has the power to suggest item nerfs like that, and two that I fear verant will actually DO THIS NERF and most likely do it without any warning.<P>/sigh<P>Zanthor Paro`Cimmerii<BR>55 Ogre Warrior<P>PS: I only play EQ because of my friends, and I find that it becomes harder and harder to cope with each time you try to do something like this.

I sincerely hope you rethink what you said here...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Hi Abashi, <BR>I'm not at all happy with your "solution" to this "problem" - I practice trade skills with almost all of my characters. I read this board constantly, and I RARELY post. But this is something I cannot remain quiet about.<P> I'm a full-time tailor, I ALWAYS have my tailoring kit on me. When i'm out fighting it serves as a holder until I go sell when all my other bags are full. <P> I'm familiar with losing items because of going LinkDead. Thats why I dont use my magician's summoned "crapbags" anymore unless i'm putting "crapdaggers" or "crapswords" or other "summonedcrap" or even "crappity-crap" in them.<BR>hehe..quote that Abashi  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Making combinable containers "eat" items on linkdeath doesn't do anything to facilitate trade skills. Is that your goal? There are already enough problems for us to deal with, why would you suggest such a thing? Just trying to get a rise out of your playerbase? (if thats it, you've succeeded, i'm irritated)<P>/bye</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Concerning items in combinable containers, I think that I'm going to chat with the programmers Monday and see if they can make the containers eat any items in them upon logoff/Linkdeath. I think that there'd be no question of the intent of those bags then. <P>Abashi, <P>I generally agree with you, and in the few instances that I haven't I've at least been able to understand your reasoning.<P>This however, is perhaps the least thought out, most illogical thing I've ever seen you post.  Were you just not thinking?<P>Would this mean that my spit in the bank will "eat"  my pie tins and spices and Sauces"<P>Can I no longer leave my patterns, raw silk swatches, Heady Kiola's metal studs, and pelts in my sewing kit in the bank or on me?<P>What about the items for the quest that are SUPPOSED to go in those bags?  Are you suggesting that you can't leave them in THE CONTAINER THEIR MEANT TO GO IN?<P>If you have some huge problem with people using containers meant to combine items as bags, seems like there has to be a better way than "eating the items on log/linkdeath"<P>From your post, I swear it sounds like someone in this thread made you mad, and you retorted with the "well, i'll just see about that".<P>Fiznar Allmachtig &lt;Circle of Vengeance&gt;<BR>53rd magician <BR>The Circle is closing, which side will you choose?<BR>http://cov.allmond.net</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>erm...actually Abashi...you might take a minute (or longer if needed) and check out the player guide that Verant/Sony support (and you even quoted in).  In this guide it suggests for some of the classes to pick up containers such as sewing kits to cut down on the weight they carry since their strength is low or they will be wearing heavy armor.<P>So in essence what you now propose to do is say "To hell with everyone that is intelligent enough to come up with a smart alternative.  To hell with everyone that reads our player guides.  To hell with monks, rangers, bards and any other toon that needs the lower weight container.  I'm Abashi and I think it should be changed, so not even the written word will keep it from happening."<P>While you're taking that second to read the players guide (the Kunark version)*, you might also want to read the part where it says that the game is living and breathing and is up to the players to come up with creative solutions to challenges the game presents.  As far as I have seen, Verant will nerf any creative solution.  <P>Leth Windrunner<BR>37 Druid<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Another follow-up on this, the database does indeed indicate that the item hasn't been changed since February. That leaves two possibilities, either there's something wrong with the field that's reporting the last date that it was changed, or there was some kind of export problem. More info Monday.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Translation: You are all liars. (The so-called new customer service in action). <P>Read my post again.  I did *not* say that it didn't happen.  Both potential problems that I suggested indicated a problem somewhere on our end.  I fail to seee how that translates to "You are all liars".  <P>&gt;&gt;&gt;BTW, how does an item that didnt enter the game until April get changed in Feburuary?<P>Items have to be created before they are put in game.  <P>&gt;&gt;&gt;Who are YOU Abashi to make ANY decisions about the gameplay in EQ? <P>I'm part of the tuning team.  That's one of the things that I do, formulate ideas to address the various issues present within EverQuest.  Whether or not I could get buy-in from the rest of the team on the issue is another thing.  The collective tuning team makes gameplay decisions, no one person.<P>&gt;&gt;&gt;I thought your job was just to represent Verant here and try and pose some of our concerns/issues to the EQ Live team?<P>Of course, but you have to get my buy-in before I'll go champion the issue in the tuning meeting.  <P>-Gordon<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
