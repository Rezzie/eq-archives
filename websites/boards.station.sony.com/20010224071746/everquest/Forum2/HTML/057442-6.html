</FONT><HR>Thinking along you spell line idea.. I thought.. Why do we have research words droping(and taking up the drop possiblities) in zones where casters are after their "all too necessary" but hardly effective spells.  Nothing more frustrating that to spend weeks in Skyfire looking for mage spells to see words,runes,and pages drop like candy but the spells everyone came for never dropping.  Why so the spell dropps have to be so random too?  Why not put mage spells on wurm(and the wurm family) necro spells on chromodacs etc?<P>I mean the spells don't make us great or anything.  We still face the true topic of this thread, being that casting classes are underpowered in the expansions.  But when collecting is all we have to do, why is it so difficult? I don't see melee having to kill gagillions of mobs to find their level 51 discipline?  (heehee is gagillions even a word?)<P>Nerma<P>still waiting for some sort of response on this excellent thread<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I've read through most of this thread and had some comments I wanted to make.<P>I play a 50+ warrior (about to ding 56), I have no alternates and outside of a level 10 cleric I haven't played since about May of 1999 I have no direct experience with the casting classes.<P>Some people still say well caster_class_01 can still do this in a raid or that.  Well that's true, every class still has some small thing they can contribute to a raid.  But what gets them (I apologize for assuming but knowing how I felt as a pre-upgrade/RoK warrior at release I think I can relate somewhat) is they they kinda say to themselves well right now I'm about 10% effective, if I was a warrior of equal level I'd be at 100% effectiveness.  After awhile that gets to you and many casters have switched to a melee class because of this.  <P>In order to stop this from happening you gotta try to balance the classes to some extent for any situation.  The side effects of not doing this and having the player base gradually shift to one side are staggering.  Look at the markup on warrior equipment these days for example (not to mention it's general rarity to begin with).  Us pure warriors who aren't decked out are on the market for warrior items but we can't afford them cuz there so many warriors clammoring for them the prices go through the roof.  And no fault to the uberguilds but when extra warrior items drop in a raid respectable caster classes with up and coming warrior alts get them over the 'hardcore' warrior who's been around the block.  I'm _NOT_ saying this is wrong - I know casters who play their warriors just as well as I do or better and so are deserving of this equipment - just stating what is becoming of the economy and such.<P>As far as creating caster items that would directly alter cast times, mana costs and target resists I'm kinda undecided.  It's a great idea for facing ubermobs, but what happens to the casual XP group when casters all over have these?  It'd be pretty nuts, could you imagine AE groups in OS using lower mana, lower casting time AEs that the mobs had a -50% resistance too.  If you could tailor the effects to specific spells (like fire bolt spells only, or healing spells only) then I guess you could balance it between raids and casual groups.<P>Another side effect of reducing any kind of casting times is it will produce additional text output for clients and already with all these low delay weapons it's getting kinda hard on modem users.  But the reverse effect could be that casters become powerful enough you don't need as many people to raid something and 10% more text output from 1 person is welcome if 1 or 2 more people aren't needed on the raid.<P>I do like the idea of a select set of no drop spells, I'm not sure I like them only dropping on raid level mobs though, perhaps questable spells that would require 1 common drop from any uber mob to get 1 spell.  Something more common than "you're prolly gonna have to clear VP and most of WW to get 1 of your no drop spells".<P>Another side effect of increasing caster effectiveness too much on raids is overcrowding.  If you only need 24 people instead of 36 people to raid something that's 12 people looking for something else todo among the vast horde of people on some servers (Fennin Ro) already looking for something to do.  But I'd say it's a much better trade off to make casters more raid friendly and adding new content (zones) than keeping the status quo.<P>So this is just a warrior giving a friendly bump to a good cause that needs addressing.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>This problem is painfully obvious in the high end game. Having played a 55 mage and a 60 rogue, I outdamage the mage by 3-4x vs god/dragon mobs with the rogue. Now granted 5 levels is a big deal, but on some of those encounters I had a 60 mage with me as well. And he told me he just sat back and let his pet fight...as he got resisted too much. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Nice post Vendrix.  I think you have described the problem perfectly.  There are few casting classes that have any role in the high level game.  Clerics (heals and rezzes) and Enchanters (speed) are among the few.  Is it any wonder Druids and Shaman want cleric-like healing powers?  Verant has so skewed the high level game towards melee characters that it has become ludicrous. <P>Verant should eliminate most of the magic resistant NPCs and bring their HPs in line with the damage dealing capabilities of casters.  Perhaps they should throw in some NPCs that are melees resistant (slow casting, undispellable high damage damage-shields, lower HPs).<P>Kunark and especially Velious are so screwed up for the high level game, I am not sure they are even capable of fixing the mess the created.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Don't you see Origen that what you fear happening if caster powers are increased is already happening in an ugly fashion.  Not only do you not need as many people now but you DON'T need whole classes.  It is already much more targeted then I think you can feel.  You fear that if casters can begin to do dmg to a mob that there will be fewer tank classes, this is un true.  Because if the casters are doing more damage they will need more defense(tanks classes) to stay alive.  And on of the first thing a caster has to balance is overburn.  But the problem now is that melee does it ALL.  They take the dmg AND dispense all the dmg TOO.  The teeter-tooter has already landed on the side of meelee and all the dmg casters are sliding down to that side.  This game will become very "dead" soon like this.<P>Be prepared for the swing unless comes along and dumps a HUGE load of increases to dmg casters very quickly.  Soon you will see nothing but melee and clerics.  <P>/sarcasm on<P>But who cares right?  I mean what is it more or less if we lose those stupid pet classes and drood and wizards and all?<P>/sarcasm off<P>Nerma<P>that sarcasm wasn't directed at anyone, just a shout into the masses.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Wow, great points Vendrix.<P>I'll start off saying I'm currently a 54 Wizard.<P>Grave:<BR>Perhaps the "newbies" need scaring.  The way the game is right now, you need to following to take out the ubers: Clerics, Rogues, and Warriors.  What's the point in leveling any other class if that's the case?<P>Sometimes I sure wish I'd been "scared" a bit more when I was leveling my wizard.<P>On the twinks issue:<BR>I've got a monk level 23ish.  He's got some good items, but certainly not the best stuff out there.<P>The monk can get a double attack in that does about 110 points with a 2hb (Sage's).  With his 1hbs (Cane of tranquil) he's hitting on each cane for 40ish (per attack).  So in theory, if both hands doubleattack, he's doing 160.  Those are both "Kunark weapons".  From the data in prior posts, he'd be even stronger with SoV weapons.<P>A 24 wizard, can do 169 points.  Per cast of a spell that uses up a goodly portion of his mana.<BR>Yes, he can do that in 3.5 seconds.  But how many times?  Six?  Seven?  And then its sit and look at a spell book for minutes.<P>Has anyone bothered to take a look at the class demographics lately?  I sure see a LOT of monks, warriors and rogues.<P>Gee, I wonder why.<P>Aaed<BR>Institute<BR>E.

</FONT><HR>Played a pally to 51, disappointed to say the least when RoK came out.  Sheleved the pally.  Played a necro to almost 56.  Necro USED to be great fun, now I see enjoyment ending REAL soon.<P>RoK with its discs and uber weapons totally messed up the classes.  Melee went from good to godlike.  Casters went from good to worse.<P>EVERYONE who was level 50 before rok had close to 200 wis or int.  After RoK, what did casters gain?  New spells that, compared to the diff/mr of the new mobs were less effective.  Pets that had fewer hps!?!?  Items that simply made you look better, and didn't really make you any stronger.<P>Where the heck are the spell haste items?  Where are the items that make casters better?  Why play a caster past 55?  Why make a mob totally magic resistant?  Any mobs totally melee resistant?   <P>Let casters 55+ play this game too.  Let them have neat items to look foward too and make them more powerful.  Ditch the 200int/wis limit.  Come on make this game fun and rewarding again!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 6 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057442-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057442.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057442-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057442-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057442-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057442-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057442&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057442&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
