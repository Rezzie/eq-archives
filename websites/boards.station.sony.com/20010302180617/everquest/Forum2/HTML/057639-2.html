&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Lots of great ideas on this thread, wanted to add my 2 cents. Im a 59th lvl paladin at the moment, and for the most part my role is more of a token one there born of any real need.<BR>At high lvl paladins are just inferior to any other class, particulary tanks. Our heals dont do much good when we are in battle, our buffs are out done by any other class, our lack of any specific skills useful for raids is legendary. <P>the major problem we have is not the "window dressing" of additional spells, or changing the lvls of spells its the overall balance. The last thing i really want is another pally only heal spell that is so weak ill never use, as most of the velious spells are.....well all the velious spells are. Or more silly dis that i never use either, these are token moves that are ment to placate us while doing ABSOLUTELY nothing to adress the balance issues.<P>The main problem with pallies comes down to simple stats. Our damage compared with any other class is pathitic, with all my heals, buffs, equipment, i still cant kill a green creature. This is the core issue, the one that must be adressed in order to make us useful again. Without increasing our damage output, the main attribue of a tank, all other balancing is just for show. Increasing our defense ability is nice, but i cant tuant anything off anyone else now doing 1/4 damage of a monk or warrior, so it ends up again being window dresssing. Increase damage output, if ya want to take away all our dis, and half of our useless spells in order to do it then thats fine.<P>After damage output is increased, the next step is to decide what role pallies should play in high lvl encounters. Right now we are religated to doing nothing. On large raids i dont heal, i dont buff, i dont cast much of anything, because my spells are useless and over ridden by everyone else. I do like the 55 wave of healing spell, but the healing of 110 hp is kinda a joke at lvl 55, so its off my list of spells to mem now. Either we should be healers, perhaps in battle with group spells that ACTUALLY heal viable and useful amounts of health, or we need to be redefined with some useful buffs or abilites. But if we are going to healers we need more firepower, if its 100-200 hp per tick heals, dont even bother giving it to us. id perfer you just come out and say we are useless then piling meaninless crap on us.<P>Forget about the whole undead thing too, there are no undead in velious in any amount that it makes that skill usefull at all. so just let it die.<P>Personally, if i had my choice, id rather not be made into a healer but be giving some useful buffs or debuffs that would be helpful. Maybe some 3-4 second stuns that ACTUALLY worked on high lvl mobs ( and didnt take forver to repop). Or slow, or lower MR, or some such thing. Or group buffs that reduced damage done to party member, or increased speed or some such. Focus on the paladins ability to lead people to battle. A group antifear aura kinda thing would be nifty too . <P>Anyway, my belief is basiclly this. Paladins as they are grow into the worst fighters in the game with absolutly no useful spells. If a rogue and a pally happen upon the same blue mob at the same level solo, the pally, with all his buffs, heals, and other spells will end up dying or running where the rogue with no buffs would win. Thus all of the skills are for not.  Dont give us more useless window dressing, otherwise im just switching to play the rogue i started out of disguest from being a pally  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I'd like to post reguarding people asking for higher taunt ... <BR>I have a 47 paladin ... went to the Hole with a 49 paladin and a 45 monk I think<BR>Monk wasn't using any weapons <BR>Other paladin was using Iksar Berserker club and MM shield<BR>I was using Wurmslayer+MM shield<P>I had stun and flash of light memmed and used them during fights.. Know What ? ... I could successfully out taunt the monk even thought he was hitting a LOT faster than me and more often I was able to out taunt the other paladin also even though he had a faster weapon he didn't use Flash of Light .. This spell even if resisted is an UBER taunt as is stun .  I don't have a hard time at all outtaunting warriors,rogues,monks, or any other class for that matter and I also have the best taunt in the game ... My ability to heal.  Heal the person in your group that needs it and guess what ... mob doesn't stay on that person long.. You instantly go right to the top of the agro list.  It's a fact .. have any cleric in your group sit immediately after healing someone ... almost instant agro.   <BR>The point I'm trying to make is that paladins have a lot of different ways to taunt (Try sitting down during the battle too ... it works also) So taunt is not the issue in a thread meant to bring us more near balance... If somehow the planets align and we get a higher offensive cap or they up our weapon skills then we won't need a higher increase in taunt at all. If we hit for 30% more of the time that's a taunt in itself.  I'm just saying stop askin for the increase in taunt .. I have found numerous ways to taunt ... you should try them yourselves ... Stick to the important issues ... DW armor effects.. which BLOW IMHO .. I hate having the only piece of armor that requires a regent.  I will probably never get a DW bp but oh well I'm wanting a Runed protector bp more .. AOF and doesn't need a regent.  Soothe on the vambreces ... Lets see ... last time I used any of this type of spell ... I think it was Lull at lvl 16 to break the 2 siren spawn... it worked then but i've never used it once since .. It's a pretty good agro .. I might even start using it to taunt.. It's almost always resisted, so it should make an excellent taunt.<BR>Stun on the bracer ... when I first read about this piece i was thrilled till i saw the cast time on it .. 4 seconds for my lvl 30 stun which normally has 1.5 cast time ... and let's see the Helm .. the most talked about piece and first to be nerfed .. I won't use the helm .. will probably never have one .. I don't want a helm that gives me a spell that's one spell lvl below my lvl 49 spells .. 30 if the changes on test go live.. People use this helm to solo and that's fine with me .. I'll most likely never have one or ever use it (I've had 4 offers to trade one to me btw).<BR>If some of the pieces had more stats that would be one thing but all but the bp and the legs have stats, As it is i'll probably worry about getting Runed protector armor more than deepwater I only have one piece.. the gaunts , and I'm only interested in one other piece .. the legs.<P>That's it for my rant on Deepwater armor and taunting... now for my rant on Valorium <P>I posted something on our planer armor in the previous thread .. Please read it and put it in your notes... Why 2 pieces of armor that you HAVE to be 46+ to obtain are marred by useless stats the most common of which is INT .. INT on WIS based hybrid armor is a joke .. please look into this .. anything and I mean ANYTHING but CHA or INT would be nice to replace those stats specially the 5 INT on the legs and the boots.. If you change it to something better , STR, WIS, AGI, or DEX, or even a resist on the boots, and  I might concider wearing them.  STR, WIS, DEX in place of the 5 int on the legs and I might concider wearing those too .<BR>Ok that's the end of my rant ... have a nice day ABSOR  ..  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I like some of the ideas posted for balance, and some I think are kinda silly. I do like having more options available to the paladin, and I do like the idea of making a shield more useful, and I do like the idea of being a leader type benefiting the group.<P>I think all of these things have one thing in common, a need for Holy Weapons.  I am not talking about swords that proc, I am talking about an effect that is available to an entire group when that weapon is wielded. Something as simple as See Invis or an increase in saves for the entire group would make Paladins distinct. Could you imagine the thrill of someone not only wanting you as another warm body, but specificly looking for a warrior of [insert EQ diety here]?<P>Different holy weapons would be based on the different gods, so there would be plenty of flavor to go around.  Different gods would have different goals to achieve, so they would want their holy warriors to utilize things in different manner. Questing would give a sense of history to the character, instead of going to the Temple of Sulesk Ro to get your armor (and we won't get into killing good aligned creatures here, you've heard it enough) you'd be called to your own temples and the quests themselves would fit into the "right" and "wrong" of that temple's mindset.<P>I'd like a holy shield, even if only to quest for a shield that bears the mark of the god I am supposed to be crusading for...<P>Same should go to spells.  It bothers me that the Paladin casts the same spells available to a DE cleric. Religion based spells should be based on that religion.<P>One thing that's always bothered me, the Halo of light.  Why would Tunare grant this spell to a worshipper she knows can already see?<P>Can we get rid of True North for a spell that might be used? By level 9, you already ought to know which way north is...<P>Can the summon weapons spells be specific to the god you worship, and in turn be a holy weapon. If I can't give the weapon to just anyone (or anyone at all actually) then make it something worth having for myself.<P>There is no reason why any character cannot know how to kick.<P>Can I use a lance with a shield? Seems silly that most lances used by knights were used with a shield...<P>Right now the AC from a shield does not balance with the damage from two weapons.  Increasing the bash skill in not the answer in my opinion because you're only trying to balance the damage of two weapons and shields will always fall short. Changing the effect shields have on their users is the answer. Perhaps instead of an AC bonus shields increased the defensive skills?  Maybe a separate skill block, which is available to anyone with bash, and both time out at the same time...<P>Or, conversely, change the way using two weapons effects someone defensively. If other melee classes were hit more often because they dual wielded, then perhaps the shield would be more useful all around? If the thread is to balance the class and not "what can I get for my paladin" then I think drawbacks for dual wielding should be considered, currently there are none, especially when you take into consideration that two proccing weapons means you'll always proc twice as much as a single wielder with the exact same weapon. Perhaps a warrior wielding two weapons would see his critials deminish, unleashing a flurry of attacks makes each one individually less important so you'd expect less opportunity for criticals.  Since Rangers don't get criticals and need to rely on dual wield to be balanced, then perhaps this is the better alternative. Or better, it may allow an opportunity for them to stand back and take advantage of their criticals with bows.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I like the idea of a paladin "rallying" (buffing) his allies, just by his mere presence in the group.  Adding to their courage and resolve, through his faith.  Etc.  Brings a lot to a group!<P>However, I don't think it should be a permanent effect, otherwise paladins have just become like a bard with one song.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>I DO think this would be an OUTSTANDING discipline, though.  Something that bestows 3 or 4 effects to the entire party (similar to a bard song).  A few ideas for the effects:<P>+ ATK<BR>+ HP regen<BR>+ damage absorb (like the Rune series)<BR>+ high chance of resiting fear spells<BR>+ AC<BR>...etc...<P>Doesn't matter what the are, really, these are just examples.  I'm thinking mainly along the lines of a "raid" discipline here -- so probably pretty substantial buffs, that last for 2-3 minutes, but with a long recycle time on the discipline (e.g. 72 minutes).  Or even make the recycle time longer; the important thing is that the buffs are actually substantial enough that they make a noticable difference.<P>On the downside, you'd probably have to make the party immune to cancel magic spells, for the duration of the disc, unless you have a way to make individual buffs "unstrippable"...  Anyway, I think the basic idea is a really good one.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I think as paladins we really need afew things. for one we need an ability that makes us usefull against uber mobs on raids, I favor the auto sheild-block idea personally. second i think we need some more offensive abilities, our damage is dow right pathetic thus the reason we are chosen over warriors in groups so often. <P>And last i think we need more weapons and sheilds; the amount of weapons we get is not acceptable and neither is the quality of the ones we do get. we need more Paladin specific weapons that are easy to get (like a Mace of shadowed soul type weapon) and some special sheilds. i think we should get some sheilds that can proc effects when used to bash.<P>I also think you should change the paladin epic becuase its pretty crappy compared to other epics. it is definetly not class defining like the rogue/cleric/ranger epics and thats what we really needed to balance us post 50. also i think that naggy and vox should always drop 1 book. that makes out Epic capable of actually getting. it sucks to have people give up their class becuase they wait on a peice of their epic they will probably never get.<P>Detrik Skyblade<BR>52 Paladin of &lt;Stasis&gt;<BR>Prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I think maybe a targetable Divine Aura spell might help the uses of a paladin being able to cast it on other people, would make truely unique.<P>The only real problems with the high lvl paladin I see with the class as a whole is:<P>1)The lack of weapons, we use the FieryDefender which is nice but not as good as many other epics or a cheap substitute since nothing else really is nearly as good as others, we need more lance and one hand type weapons maybe a unique one not ment for medium lvls.  <BR>2) Lack of ability to help on a raid, although it has improved thanks to divine strength, we still do not really serve a use against really high lvl mobs, in Velious.  Maybe a disc or a unique spell that can improve others during battle.  <BR>3) There are literaly no undead in Velious only one zone has many undead, thus holystrike is basicaly useless.  <BR>4)Paladins are fine at low lvls infact they almost equal a warrior having nice swords.  But once they hit 50s they become obsoleate, when you can have a better tank and a healer that can heal twenty times more efficiently then a paladin.<P>If other classes are getting increases I guess it would warrent getting more defense but is not needed as much as other things such as discs, weapons.<P>Those are really the only problems I see with the paladin class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I been playing The Paladin class for more then 15 years in many type of games.  <P>I think that paladins should be able to equip a shield while wielding 2-handed weapons after level 50. This would 1 help us with our AC. Or like the<BR>warrors Epic let our epic split into a sword and shield. Being as it may I loved being lower levels for the fact I love useing my old GB and a shield.<BR>But as I got into level 50+ I just could not do any damage to the mobs with it and in turn had to go to the Soulfire then the FA and next the FD.<BR>I really hated this I wanted to keep useing my shield because I belive that is the way a paladin would be.<P>increase skill in 1 hand weapons. This increase would let some of us who like useing one hand and shield stay with it. <P>increase our +Bash skill also add more damage to it. This is same as above this would keep us useing our one hand slashing and shield.<P>Defense skill cap made exactly same as warriors. We need this bad. Being a paladin alot of time my job is to help protect the caster types. in<BR>turn if a caster get's attack My job is to get it off the caster and on me. This would let me stay alive longer until the real tanks or enchaters got<BR>it mes or off me. <P><BR>increase TAUNT: this would help us get mobs of caster types<P><BR>LOH should be CH after 50+ level This would just be what it should be. A Save your butt once ever 72 min.<P>Innate ability to crit undead. Paladins being (The master of undead fighters) would do just that. let us fight undead like we was ment to. <P>discipline This one is hard to say. What do we truly need? I think we need something like the a max LOH. We choise to give up our life. to Save<BR>the life of our party. ( IE.. I give up my live to give everyone in the party say 1500 hp back and only get back 50% exp on a res) This would be<BR>the most noble thing a paladin could do. <P>Now Spells. this one is hard. Everyone wants better spells.<P>Celestial Healing this spell needs to heal more hp to be useful. <P>Wave of Healing this needs to heal more to be useful in a big raid or even in a group.<P>Divine Might: needs to be changed or have an upgrade to it. I say maybe Adding AC and att speed to it.<P>New level 53 paladin spell, Divine Glory, Should give us like 200 hp and some ac then divine strength should give us more hp and more ac and<BR>should be stackablewith other type spells. This would help more in a battle give us a spell that is more useful. <P>Flame of light should have more damage out put. Reason Paladins are not just undead fighters. We fight all Evil. Living things too. We need spells<BR>to help damage the living evil as well as the undead evil.<P>We need better undead spells. Once again here we should be able to do some kind of damge to undead that no one else can. You are the ones<BR>who put us as the fighters of undead. So make us that. <P>Unless you improve our healing spells somehow then we are worthless in healing. <P>If you move AOF down to 49 you should also put in it's place a AC buff at 53 not just a hp buff in turn goes back to adding ac to the new spell.<P>I all this would help 'balance' the paladins and make them more wanted in groupage at higher levels. <P>I know SK and Rangers need work to help them more balanced. But I belive if you take time for a few min and really look at what you want the<BR>Paladins to be you see that we all want the same thing. <P>     Thank you for hearing me out a 53 level paldin  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Forgive the bluntness of this post but I'm not going to paint a beautiful picture for you explaining what is wrong with my class, paladins.<P>1.  Pallys were fine up until kunark and then when all the beta testing for kunark spells etc became known everyone began whining about how strong pallys were going to be with getting sup heal and the cleric 49 res as well as resolution and shield of words etc.  Well to make up for the spells hybrids were getting verant gave all pure melee disciplines on top of their skill improvements like triple attack and double backstab etc.  Unfortunately the pure melee far exceeded the abilities and skills of hybrids because of this and thus we started becoming useless.  Next when velious was launched at an attempt to resolve the problem about the discs hybrids recieved discs as well, to bad there isn't 1 useful pally disc and sounds like the other hybrids aren't to happy about theirs.  <P>Also with velious pallys recieved a group heal which is by far the worst spell I've ever seen.  This spell costs way to much mana for the puny amount of hp it gives.  It barely touches the health bar on a 55+ caster when they are buffed that's how pathetic it is. <P>Next there is the flame of light DD spell which isn't all that bad, but it is one of those things verant put in to say that they gave us something we didn't have and makes us more powerful.  Reality check here, pallys are part priest part warrior yet we don't get any of the priest line of nukes except for the undead ones?  We fight evil NOT just undead, we are experts against fighting for the better cause NOT just against undead so where is my wrath of the gods spell huh?  If your going to show such partiality to pallys then take away all the nukes that rangers and SKs have and only give them nukes against summoned and undead as well.<P>Next is divine light, well I can't really say anything bad about this cause it's a nice spell.  However, don't you think it's a little messed up that a level 39 pally can get the same hp per mana regeneration as a level 60 pally?  Common now that's just retarded.<P>Divine strength is the last of the velious spells and definitely one of the better spells, to bad melee damage dealing classes prefer the level 50 store bought ranger spell instead of the pally level 60 mob dropped spell.<P>Divine might is something that hasn't been mentioned much but it happens to be the pally level 50 quest spell.  Well, when velious came out both rangers and SKs recieved new spells for weapon prob buffs but pallys didn't.  Don't you think that if ranger, who never had this ability before, have a spell that allows them to do 75dmg weapon procs (10dmg more than the pally spell) that pallys should get a new and improved weapon proc spell?  I mean rangers duel weild and then you give them a weapon proc spell that does more than pallys?  Since pallys CAN'T duel weild pallys should have a higher dmg weapon proc spell.  You had 3 in there before velious why did you take them all away?<P>Now with the test server changes which is an attempt to test out how these new abilities will balance the classes, what in the heck are you thinking about with the celestial cleansing spell?  Either verant sees pallys as almost balanced with healing abilities or they have a very sick sense of humor.  How in the frickin world does a higher level spell that heals less hp and has an incredibly worse mana to hp heal ratio than a previous spell help balance the pally class on their ability to heal?  That makes me sick, it's almost as bad as the wave of healing spell.  I can't believe that after seeing how velious changes certain classes abilities that you wouldn't give pallys celestial healing as it is for the clerics (that means don't mess with it) when you are giving druids and shamans a heal that is even better than celestial healing.  Verant has kept pallys on par with druids and shamans for their healing ability cause both druids and shamans have their nukes, dots, and buffs that prevent them from being a full healing class such as a cleric.  Well pallys don't have any of the above not even buffs because of the game mechanics.  Celestial healing isn't even a full 150hp more of a heal than superior heal so it would be the ideal perfect upgrade heal spell for a pally IF they were not getting the same heal spell druids and shamans will be getting.  You treat us like degraded casters with the spells you give us.  Most pallys don't have max wisdom even with uber gear and there is no such thing as specialize for a hybrid but yet all the spells come from the parent class at the same or worse mana cost.<P>Pallys are unbalanced in everquest today because their spells are useless, they can't even do a respectable amount of damage even with a decent weapon, and almost all pure melee can tank just as good or better (warrior monks rogues).  The weapon selection for pallys is insane and the drop ratio for those weapons is ungodly rare.  The same applies for the armor drops especially planes armor.  It is sooo bad it would still be bad if there were only a handful of pallys for each server.<P>There are a variety of duel weilder weapons that all have stats similar to 10dmg 19dly or 12dmg 21dly but the pally uber weapons I can still count on 1 hand and they are no better quality than what's available when kunark 1st opened.  The 2 hander selection and quality has improved very slightly but almost not even noticeable for pallys.<P>From past experiences with verant balancing issues this pally thread is probably a joke.  All pallys ever get anymore from verant is a nerf or some greatly degraded spell or ability with horrific efficiency and when pallys complain verant says they gave us something we needed.  Quit playing word games and actually balance us this time without overpowering the other classes right afterward and maybe pallys will be useful in the game again.  Otherwise just change the name everquest about how 3 classes can rule the world of norrath.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>1handerDeepwood, my original post was more brief. However since it seems there is no reference to the original thread, so I must assume my post was not read. Since everyone has talked about discs and spells, I thought I would cover something else different therefore my post is different than the first time i posted. <P>I'm NOT repeating information, I'm giving concise examples of the weapon inventory available for paladins. As far as I have read/skimmed, this has not been discussed throughly. If you intend to "police" the Pally thread talks, I would suggest you police the redundant threads abouts discs and spells, because that point has already been made. If you have nothing to say but ***** about redundant threads, please say nothing at all. Everyone has their own ideas and opinions. So far it looks like most of the paladin community has made a strong central arguement petaining to discs and spells. I am merely pointing out the other aspects that need to be covered. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Paladins need: To be useful in largescale encounters/have flavor added to them as to make them more class accurate.<P>Face it with me guys, mele will never be our forte.  We do not deserve improved offensive abilities.   <P>Buffing, healing, tanking etc.  We do Many things well, but none the best.  We are a spotfill, and we should accept this role.  We will never be the "main" tank.  Who'd play a war if this were ever so.<P>Think about the roleplaying definitive paladin.<P>-protect the weak<BR>-will sacrifice themself for the greater good<BR> (with reckless abandon for others safety)<BR>-fights for a just cause<BR>-heal or mele in a pinch with a furor (quickly or strongly done)<P>Pal's should go towards this role more in the future.  A quickfix character till things can get taken control of by the parentclass in a fight.  Because they can not react as quickly as we can. (war/cle)  But still be good enough to be useful in everyday grouping.<P>In many raids I have been on, I have had to play "caster babysitter".  I am assigned a caster b/c the raid knows I can keep them alive in the short run with the greatest likelyhood of success.  LOH-instant, Divine favor-near instant, Gheal/supheal. Taunt/blind/root/stun(s), and overall removal of aggro from a pc.<P>I like playing in the background keeping the casters alive so they can do their duty.  Drop mobs fast.  I don't engage the mob many times because I feel I can be more useful doing this.  My dmg sucks so why not keep someone alive who can nuke the mob.<P>I want to see things added along the lines of:<P>-Keeping party members alive longer through:<BR>   <BR>   -absorb dmg in place of party members<BR>         -keep pc's fighting longer<BR>  <BR>   -dmg soaking spells for other pc's (rune type)<BR>         -keep pc's fighting longer   <BR>  <BR>   -extremely fast mana inefficient heals<BR>         -till the cle can get cheal off.<BR>   <BR>   -Ability to aggro mobs, as allowable.<BR>         -high end dmg on our hits<BR>         -True and divinely guided blows<BR>         -make them slow and taunt heavy<BR>   <BR>   -decent defenses so I can live in my job.<BR>         -Let the war take over so I don't die<BR>         <P>What I basically want to be is a support class for the fighting and healing.  i want to be able to jump in and be able to save people from dying at the drop of a hat through various means at my disposal.  We allready have the mele/defense part of this down.  I think we just need the spell half and we would be quite useful on raids and such.  Spells like these could really show how good the player was, by allowing them to keep people alive longer.<P>Adding anything like this would not take away from the "everyday" game.  Because people will always accept a tank who does less "dpm" if they have a decent group that can drop mobs.<P>Thx for listening.<P>Renlain Wyrmslayer<BR>55th Knight<BR>TCC<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Before even buying EQ I knew what class I was going to play... The Paladin. Thoughout my role-playing life I had always played the Paladin, I enjoyed being able to cast some benficiary spells and also heal. I also enjoyed being able to Fight and Absorb damage as well as any warrior. A Paladin is a warrior who can cast clerical spells, they are just as good as any other warrior, and they pay for this but Leveling slower. <P>When I started EQ I understood that I was taking a exp penalty so that I would when reaching the same level as a warrior, be just as good in every aspect, but be able to cast as well. I played EQ going through my life leveling slower and when finally reaching level 50 I felt great, I was just as good as warriors, but could buff and heal. Then Kunark came out, the bane to all the hybrids problems! Warriors and rogues got boosted so that they would be more viable to group with, more powerful, which in the end made hybrids worth a lot loss and they couldn't keep up.<P>Now with Velious Paladins have gone to the bottom of the ladder, there are few high level Paladins. This is because we have nothing that puts us in a class of our own, nothing that makes as a needed valuable class to group with. I mean sure we can heal, buff, tank and do some damage, but NO where as good as any of the parent classes. Some of us spent over a year playing our Paladins with an exp penalty, hoping that for our trouble we would be rewarded. Then the exp penalty was removed, we had worked so hard for nothing, not very fair, you should have just left the exp penalty where it was and made us more powerful, we EARNT it!<P>But anyway what can be done now? Here is what can help<P>Spells- <P>Our Heals come at too late a level, not much more to say here. Make our Heal spells available at lower levels. <P>Wave of Healing- 450mana to heal 200hp to the entire party. This spell has an extremely short casting time, which makes it good for emergencies. At level 55 it doesn't help in a fight, 200hp is one hit at this level. To make this spell better, reduce the Mana Used and Increase the HP healed.<P>Celstial Cleansing- I believe is is 440hp in 24 seconds. Ok again at 59 not worth it, just give us Celestial Healing period.<P>Our Buffing spells are good, I like them, except that if a Paladin joins a group, they are more than likely going to be joining a group with a cleric. Therefore our buffs are not needed nor wanted. I will gladly offer my buffs to group members, BUT rarely will one except when they can get better cleric buffs. So what can be done about this? Give us some unique buffing abilties, either by a seperate buff line, or by some group buffing spells.<P>Group buffing spells you say? Let me elaborate on this, Most clases bring something unique to a group, paladins don't. Our only class defining skill is LoH, which in the higher levels just doesn't cut it anymore. So give us some spells that help the entire group. Lets look at some examples:<P>-Increase the Attack rating of all party members.<BR>-Reduce the chance that spells and attacks will be interrupted.<BR>-Reduce the Defense and Resistances of enemies attacking the party.<BR>-Increase Damage Dealt by group members<BR>-Increase the Armor Class of party members<P>These would be unique spells, completely different to cleric lines of spells.These kind of spells, although similar to bard songs and some indivdual spells, would make Paladins welcome to groups and to Large Raids! These are just some examples, but I am sure that there are many others that could be thought of.<P>Last but not least our Stuns. These are a paladins greatest weapons. There is nothing like stunning a mob, just before it is about to gate out, or cast a heal. Our Stuns are great, but at higher levels their effciency is greatly reduced, because of constant resists and unstunnable mobs. Reduce the resist rates for stuns and make 55+ mobs stunnable.<P>That is basically my gripe on the Paladin spells, but now what about the Paladin as a tanking class.<P>Tanking-<P>As it stands right now, Paladins do not have the tanking ability of pure Warriors. A Paladin is suppose to be the Holy Defender... DEFENDER to me means being able to take hits like a warrior. We should have the same Defensive skill caps as warriors, the Same AC, the Same HP. Something must be done here, we need more defense.<P>Damage Dealing-<P>Paladins are part warrior, part cleric. We should not be able to deal damage as well as any warrior, as they should be duel wielding. But we should be able to do a decent amount of damage. We should not be missing so much. We should be able to hit just as much as any warrior, we miss a lot and I mean A LOT!!! It's not much fun to swing my sword and see miss after miss, no matter if I am fighting Greens upto Reds, I miss. Then when finally hitting the mob, we do minimal damage. Make us Hit more, we know how to use a sword, we should be able to hit with it. Make us use the same hit table as warriors!<BR> <BR>Also Paladins should always do criticals against Undead. This shouldn't be a discipline, but just a natural bonus.<P>Disciplines-<P>The Holyforge discipline is useless, utterly! Remove it, please. Replace it with a defensive discipline, like warriors get.<P><BR>I hope you consider some of these ideas, in fact I hope you consider all these idea's. I have been playing this class in EQ for over a year, it was my first class and will be my last class. So please, make an old Paladin happy, I payed for my Experience penalty and got nothing in return for it. Verant you owe us, make us proud!<P>Lothwane Holyblade<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

(if you don`t do so here is another approach)<P>-NEW IDEA (at least I think so):<BR>Basically we should be half warrior, half cleric<BR>now we are 1/4 th warrior and 1/4 cleric).<P>What do you think about giving pallys the possibility to chose one of the above ways sometime in their carrier.<BR>a) Way of the Holy Warrior... larege upgrade in fighting skills at the cost of a large decrease in casting skill and spell repertoire.<BR>b) Way of the Holy Soother: Large upgrade in cleric skills with the downside of decrease in warrior skill.<P>We should of course be less effective than both parent classes but come second to them.<P>Mid-level Play:<P>-Would be nice to have some sort of spell that allows coming to a party already in a dungeon and leaving early when RL calls.<BR>ALL other classes have this ability in some way (gating, invis, camouflage, feign death, sneak).<BR>I know we are holy warriors and aren`t meant to cowardly hide but why not giving us a "holy aura" spell that reduces aggro as long as we just walk and do nothing else. Would be a real help and not very unbalancing I think as all other classes already have it (another idea would be a mid lvl questable no drop item giving right click invis or make invis potions stackable please)<P>-Please change the book part of our Epic... If you aren t in a large guild you will never get the book as in most of the raids first book goes to pally from organizing guild... :((<BR>(Give us a LONG, quest for maybe 10 no drop items from midsized mobs which can be killed with  one or two low 5o`s groups which in the end can be turned in for the books....PLEASE!!!<P>-Please give deepwater armor more usefull effects...  <BR>-Please increase Ro armor so you aren`t laughed at when you wear it instead of Ry`Gorr and did the long quest...<BR>-Please change fizzle rate on spells( I have wis 147 and still fizzle with maxed skill on greater healing three times in a row for increased mana cost and casting duration :((<P>- More quest that don`t require mindless killing and add a bit of holy knight flavour...<BR>More factions for us pallies to take care of...<BR>- Please fix the "broken" quests requiring us to do "evil" deeds...<P>You did a real great job in removing the attack counter reset when casting... :)<P>Be safe all, wherever you are<P>One from Bristlebane server...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Paladins and Sks can have the best AC in the world but still not be effective to the group because damage output is too low.  Therefore, Mobs are not attacking these hybrids but the rangers etc. in the group.   These hybrids need to perform 2/3erds damage of a typical warrior.  As it stands, they do about 1/3erd damage of a typical warrior.  Consequently, they cannot obsorb the damage they should or taught mobs off others.<P>Therefore, I recommend the following to permit these defensive tanks to be fully defensive:<BR> - Increase Bash capabilities<BR> - Increase Melee capabilities (not <BR>   just spell damage output)<BR> - Increase stun/bash capabilities to<BR>   disable casting mobs<BR> - Give Pallies critical hits against undead<BR>   (always having this capability)<P>Finally, to make paladins more useful to groups I recommend superior heal at an earlier age and experience res's at an earlier age, say 53-55.  This would make Pallys more useful in everyday encounters and epic encounters.<P>Lalla<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

An NPC (pet) that can attack (offense) and taunt (defense).

</FONT><HR>I am just grateful that I have good friends in game, otherwise I would never be able to find a group that can use my wonderful Paladin abilities.  Let's face it, any Mage that is within 5 lvls of us has a pet that can outdamage a Paladin.  My guess will be though, instead of strengthening Paladins, they will weaken pets to correct this, heh.  As you can see by this post, after being part of EQ since March of 99, I am starting to get a little discouraged.  I just don't understand how a "knight", by all definitions an elite soldier, cannot fight his way out of a paper bag?  For the last year and a half (prior to this recent patch) we suffered horrible xp penalties for what, to be one of the most useless classes in game??  Now the penalty is gone, but what good does that do us?  At level 50, I really do not want to start over to create a class that will be more useful, plus I have always played Paladins in these type of games.  I do know how to play a Paladin to its best ability.  I stun when the Necros fear breaks, I heal when the cleric gets low, I taunt as best I can and root those extra mobs.  But none of this is anything that another class can't do much better and I cannot think of a class that cannot outdamage me( some great knight).  Maybe I will just have to wait for a new game that will give Paladins their due respect as a class.<P>Jaybartu<BR>Paladin 50th Season<BR>Tarrew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I absolutely LOVE the idea of a Specialization for paladins that was mentioned earlier.  Two routes to choose from.  Holy healer, or holy warrior.  <P>That idea was awesome in thought, although it would probably make verant have to come up with alot of things to differentiate the class's two splits (more work for verant).  And then other classes would whine about it, so in all probability it will never go live.<P>Maybe give us the option to go all cleric or all warrior so we'll be useful again.  Fade out our respective powers from the class that we are shunning and be a staple in groups again.  If they did this I'd give it serious thought the way things stand now.<P>Renlain Wyrmslayer<BR>55 knight<BR>TCC<BR>Lanys servor</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>1a) Raise the Parry cap for Paladins to 200 (Defence)<BR>1b) Raise the Riposte cap for Shadowknights to 200 (Defence with a cruel edge)<BR>1c) Raise the Dodge cap for Rangers to 200 (For god's sake, they're wearing lighter armour!)<BR>1d) Raise the Parry and Riposte caps for Warriors to 225 and the Dodge cap to 200. (I agree, they should be better at tanking.)<P><BR>2) All weapons should have a minimum damage level, and not just two handed weapons. Minimum damage for a weapon is skill-100%. Thus, a Level 20 with maxed skills (105) has a minimum damage of 5% of the output of the weapon. So, if he had some weapon with an insane damage of 40, his minimum damage would be 2. However, at level 30 with maxed skills (155) he has a minimum damage of 55%. With that same weapon, his minimum strike is 22. At level 40 the minimum becomes 105% and so on.<P>This again leaves Warriors as the champs in the high-end game with a maxed out minimum of 150%, while Rangers stay close with a minimum of 140% and SK's and Pallys lag behind at 125%.<P>(This idea may or may not be applied to Bards & Rogues, but should be applied to Monks. I just never bothered to look up Monk skill progression.)<P><BR>3) Allow all Melee classes to have the Block skill, but only allow it to work/improve when the person is using a shield. With this, the Parry/Riposte improvements for the Paladins/Shadowknights become less required.<P><BR>4) While the effect of having low stats is obvious, (Just watch what happens to your AC when your Agl goes below 75) the effect of having high stats is difficult to see at best. The damage output of a Warrior with 250 Str should be OBVIOUSLY higher than the same Warrior with only 150 Str. (Shamen will like this one too.)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>The books for the Fiery Avenger should be dropping off of the dragons in Kunark as a regular drop.  We have killed the dragons a total of 14 times approximately in the last month and we have received ONE BOOK off of Severilous in Emerald Jungle.  It was the burnt book that Nagafen would have dropped if Verant wouldn't have nerfed the dragons.  <P>My suggestion is to combine the books as ONE DROP.  Have the books drop as the completed book of scale that you would normally have to go to Neriak to complete.  Increase the drop rate of the books.  One book for killing 14 dragons is a huge freaking bottle neck.<P>Our Fiery Avenger weapon upgrade should have been a 1h slash - I don't understand why you guys don't understand every one wanted a 1h as the upgrade and yet we get stuck with a 2h slasher again....  Thanks for listening to us on this issue for months and months. <P>No haste on the epic weapon?????  How many classes get a haste better than dragon haste on their epics?  I think our epic is ok, but it is certainly not a Ragebringer or a Swiftwind or the bards epic etc...  All these have excellent haste stats on them so why don't the SK's and Pallies???<P>Defense, Bash, Offense - raise em all.<P>Make our epic books drop please - I am tired of waiting on books at 60th level...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here is a good 'Paladin like' spell that would be usefull in certain situations in large raids.  The concept was given but here are some thoughts about how to implement it.<P>Level 51:  Paladin has a 50% chance of taking the damage done to another.  The targeted person must be grouped.  The initial cost will be 300 mana.  The spell will be a mana drain, using 25 mana per tick, the spell effect will wear off once mana is 0 or 10 minutes is up.. whichever occurs first.  Thus, for a paly w/a wisdom of 125 the spell should last for about 5 minutes. Recast time will be 10 minutes.  Additionally since it will be random as to wether the paladin takes the damage he sould approximately take 50% of the damage but there is no guarantee.  Just like in meleing sometimes I hit a mob 10 times in a row but then miss it the same amount directly afterwards.<P>Lvl55: The spell will be upgraded to a 75% chance of success and the mana dot will be reduced to 20 mana per tick. Allowing the spell to last for about 6 minutes. Initial mana cost will be increased to 350 mana with the same 10 minute recast time.<P>Lvl60: The spell will be upgraded to a 90% chance of sucess and the mana dot will be reduced to 15 mana per tick allowing the spell to last for about 8 minutes. Initial mana cost will be increased to 400 mana with the same 10 minute recast time.<P>As every bit of the paladins mana will be important to protecting another char mana will already be well spent on potentially saving someone else for at least a short amount of time. The spell should not be stackable w/ any other paladin's protection.  As it has heavy mana costs for simply taking a chance at reducing the damage to another it should not be even close to more efficient as now two characters will need healed and the damage done to them both is highly random reducing the effeciency of healing.  However, it could save the protected person from enough dmg to survive an attack for a longer period of time then they otherwise would.<P>Balank  56th Knight<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>In my last post I posted about the skills and spell problems. One of the other major factors is about the equipment Paladins get. Our equipment before Kunark and Velious was just fine. but with the new updates we have really been neglected.<P>First of all the Deepwater Armor. As someone posted earlier, why is it that warriors ac is the same on all the items except the BP and Legs? Should not Paladins be the same? One of the major problems, is the lack on insight put in to assigning the spells to the individual pieces. We get very average spells, if not useless spells. Every other class gets some unique spells, but we are stuck with utter junk! I mean Verant gave warriors and rogues the ability to cast spells by using there armor, this is plain stupid. In no way should warriors and rogues, be able to heal themselves, shrink, invis, etc etc. <P>If you want to balance the classes, you can start by stop FAVORING certain classes. Why in the world should Warriors be able to Heal themselves? Although they can't use it in a fight, it reduces there downtime considerably. What about shrinking, invising, spells that they SHOULD NOT HAVE! Get rid of them. To make it fair, make all the pieces if armor for each type of class, cast the same sort of spells! But make the BP and Legs cast class specific spells to vary it, as these drop of Very high level mobs.<P>Next increase the drop rate in Fear for Paladin Armor. It is pitiful, you are lucky to see one piece drop. <P>Weapons are another problem. We dont get enough class specific weapons, and the only ones we do get are extremely rare and hard to obtain. Give us more weapons that are more abundant.<P>Now the EPIC quest. This bit concerns me a lot, as we need to get a Fiery Avenger, but the books are so hard to find, because of three factors. First is that the books drop off Naggy and Vox, which anyone over 53 can't kill, so will very unlikely get the books off these. Secondly the books are rumored to drop off the new dragons in Kunark. Again these dragons are extremely hard. Number three is that rarely, very rarelydo the new dragons drop the books. Increase the drop rate or make another quest so that we can get the Fiery Avenger.<BR>The Fiery Defender in itself is a pitiful excuse for a Epic weapon. The only class in the game that is suppose to get a Holy Weapon, gets a very un-unique and pretty all round average weapon, when compared to other classes. Sure if no one else got Epics, it would be great, but they do. Do something about this, not much thought was put into the weapon itself. Damage and Delay is ok, but could be better. The stats, sure fine.. the Proc completely and utterly old, non-inventive, boring, any other words come to mind? What were the designers thinking about when they made this weapon. Give it some better procs or effects. Give it Haste, improve attack, improve defense, and a stun proc. One proc doesn't do it, sorry.<BR>Also the good old yellow/orange Flame, come on Verant I know you have some designing talent there, why that old re-used color? The look of the weapon is good, I really like it, but change the flame, make it blue or green, just something different.<P>Anyway that is enough out of me.<P>Lothwane Holyblade<BR>A Paladin going insane that nothing is being done.

</FONT><HR> My short and sweet suggestion:<P> Keep the gap between pally and warrior skill caps that was in existance pre level 50.<P> Most people see these as the "good old days", when all classes were useful and paladins could be effective tanks. Don't give us just defense without offense, because, as someone mentioned earlier:<P> Defense does -not- stack.<P> Only offense does.<P> Other than that...perhaps a stun that is effective at higher levels? More mid level armour and weapons that are balanced for a class that will never get dual wield. Right now, a lot of pallys are using weapons that dual wielding classes are using, the drawbacks of which are obvious.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR> Here is something I found on another thread - one of the best ideas I've seen regarding class balance:<P> Mad_Hatter<BR>Station Member  posted 02-15-2001 12:35 PM        <BR> I hate to break the news to you... but Warriors SHOULDN'T be the best at both offense and defense. They should be the only class that's exactly balanced between the two.<BR> How balance can be reached<BR>  ----------------------------<BR> Monk - 70%O 30%D<BR> Ranger - 60%O 40%D (spells included)<BR> Warrior - 50%O 50%D<BR> Pally - 30%O 70%D (spells included)<BR> SK - 40%O 60%D (spells included)<P> As it is now, the warrior is the best at Offense and Defense which equates to 70%-70%. It's no wonder Verant can't keep it balanced, that's obviously more than 100%. Are Warriors overpowered? No! Are they underpowered? No! Are other classes underpowered in certain areas with reguard to Warriors, Yes. Are some overpowered in  certain areas? Yes.<BR> Warriors are the class by which all others are based. The standard. They should be/are/will always be better at offense then pallys/SKs and always better at defense  than monks/Rangers. But they cannot be the best at everything because why would anyone want to play any other class then?<BR> A warrior should NOT be the best tank AND the best damage dealer. You can't have the best of both worlds. A warrior's role should be based on a balance between the two. Your true versatility is the ability to fill the role of tank OR damage dealer  dependant on need.<P>-----------------------------------------------<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>As said above we need better tanking abilites. Now my fist sugetion as i saw above was a paly pet, not bac i think at a higher lvl could be from a quest of some kind. Maybe have a pet for undead attack and one for evil attack make them short lived like 2 min . My other sugestion is to give palys and sk the abilit to specialize in a certan wepon type such as 2hs 1hs ect. now doing this will give bonus to hit and higher att levels but at the cost of lossing abbiliy with other types of wepons. As u get a higher skill u become specilezed with that att and can only use a 2hs or 1hb depending what u like.  Maybe as an adden bouus when u reach a certain lvl of specialion u gain an extra ability like with a 1hs and shield a sheild bocking ability and with a 2hs being able to hold a sheild (have to be a light sheild useing a 2 handed weopon) something like that.  well my two cents</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>my main is a lvl 44 paladin on the vallon zek server. one of my main ideas is that a paladins disease and poison resistances should go up with every couple lvls warriors MR goes up and gets better why don't some of pally resistances get better as they lvl.all this talk of paladins being useless after lvl 50 kinda disturbs me cause all i play is my paladin and i would hate to have to make another character after i hit 50 because no one wants me in groups because i am useless. my paladin is a hard core melee fool. i do think some added AC and Hpts would help alot. i love my spells but being that we are a hybred melee class i think that more sserious consideration into the melee aspect of the class would definatly make us more useful we are supposed to be defensive in nature so making our defensive melee skill stronger and withn a igher cap would make it better. but the thing is paladins are knights  we are the defenders our melee skills should be almost as good as pure warriors. better AC and more hpts and maybe even better attack would help. as a paladin at lvl 44 i have 1500 hpts buffed with my spells a warrior of the same lvl has almost 2000 if not more unbuffed  WE need more HPTS</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Simple test - which style of fighting requires less down time:  double your damage output, or increase your damage absortion by 20%?<P>Lets say the mob has 1000hp, you have 1000hp, and you and the mob do 1000hp damage per minute.<P>Round 1: you and the mob both die after one minute.<P>Round 2: double your damage.  mob is now dead in 30 seconds, you take 500hp damage. You also have an extra 30 second to recoup from the fight, that you did not have in round one.<P>Round 3: original damage output, increase damage absortion by 20%.  after one minute, mob is dead, you have 200 hp left.<P>What the hell am i trying to say?  A marginal increase in our defense will not have a significant impact on our class.  Dealing more damage is still much more important than taking ALMOST as much damage as a warrior (remember, they still have better parry/riposte/dodge, and more HP). And, they do twice the damage paladins do.  So long as warriors take more damage than paladins, every group will still want warriors, for their defense, and for their damage output.<P>Most of our problems are post 50, where every group needs a cleric. Now seeing as all of our buffs are the same as lower level clerics, our spells are pretty useless.  Take away our spells, and that leaves us with our melee skills.<P>We do half the damage of the other melee classes (even SKs, if you count their dots and lifetaps), but no class take double the damage that we do.  We give up ALOT of offense, for very little defense.  I have met several monks/rangers that have AC very close to mine, yet I do no where near the damage they do.  Simply increasing our defense is not enough, unless we become the best at defense.  If monks and rogues can out damage warriors, then why can't paladins have better defense?  If rangers get the same offensive skills as warrirors, wont they outdamage them, when you consider their spells ? <P>Rangers have several self buffs that stack with cleric buffs, why dont we?  Rangers bramble coat adds 19ac at lvl 49, and call of earth at 50 that adds 25ac- thats 44AC in addition to any cleric spells.  On test they now have jolt at 51.  Not only do they now do twice the damage paladins do, they have all the defensive help they need to keep the mobs off them.  And if the mob does agro on them, they have several self damage shields, to kill the mob faster.<P><BR>Every class has a skill that makes them needed/desired, except for paladins- our healing post 50 doesnt count. If shamans and druids are unable to fill the role of healer, then a paladin can't.  SKs have darkness, rangers have snare. Stopping mobs from leaving is essential in dungeon fighting.  Our lvl22 root spell is lucky to last 5 seconds.  SKs have fear, rangers have SOW, both important for outdoor fighting.  Rogues have sneak, essential for fast CR.  Monks and SK have feign death, essential if a bard or enchanter is not in the group.  The damage from monks, rogues and warriors is significant.  The warriors defense and high HPs and effective taunt are essential to reducing the strain on clerics.  What do paladins offer?  stun, extremely low damage, marginally better tanking than rangers and monks/rogues.  Useful spells? nope. cleric has upgrades to all of them.<P>If rangers get anti-agro to address their problem of too much damage, no defense, then why dont palis get an agro spell to help the keep the mob targeted on them ?<P>Zaid Ynot, 51 cavalier</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok - This morning I have sat down and read over every word thtas posted about paladins.<P>I also read SK, and looked for all info i could on warriors.<P>Verant needs to understand the seriousness of what i say here, or we will all spend alot of time achieving nothing.<P>Paladins cannot be balanced in their current form, because there parent class is not balanced.<P>Because warriors are supposed to be best defence, and almost the best offense, there is nothing left for Paladins to be best at.<P>The paladin class has no defining characteristic anymore.<P>Consider these points :-<P>Healing - Every other class that heals, heals better, more mana efficiently, and with a greater mana pool than a paladin, excepting the other hybrid class - rangers.<P>Buffing - All hybrid classes can buff, but at post level 50, NO group enjoys regular, serious exp giving encounters, without a class whose buffs overwrite the paladin buffs.<P>Direct Damage spells - The paladin, has the worst direct damage spells in the game, of any casting class.<P>Damage over Time spells - As above.<P>General group support spells - roots, snares, stuns etc - every other casting class can deliver similair or better spells, far more efficiently, and with less resists than a paladin.<P>Melee Offense - Paladins have the worst melee offense in the game, I belive SK's have the second worst, though they have fairly substantial dd and dot spells (1k damage i believe) post 50.<P>Melee Defense - Paladins have argueably the second best defense in the game. The reason why its secons best and not WORSE, is bcause we dedicate ourselves to our armor class, just so we CAN BE second best. I have Arguments with monks at which is a better tank - Paladin or Monk - I point to my ac and hitpoints, they point to there ac (higher) and avoidance skills, along with disciplines. It should also be noted that Barbarian Rogues Can get there armor class within 50 armor class points of the paladin, and can have large amounts of hitpoints too. I can prove this - I have an L35 Barb rogue who is in Ravenscale armor, with 1037 hp 702 and 777 atk. At similair levels, my pally was in the 600's.<P>Melee Disciplines - Paladin disciplines are a joke. I am level 52 - and I have just 1 !!!!! resist! I get fearless at 53 i am told - WHEN ITS TOO LATE TO DO NAGGY AND VOX, and ill have to wait until i hit level 59 to be invited along on uber dragon raids.<P>Paladin Melee avoidance skills - What gives with our disarm skill being capped at 75 ? why did you even bother to give it to me. Bash is sort of useful - I can stun bash wurms in Burning woods which is kinda fun (being a dwarf). the damage of course is negligeable. Riposte - every once in a while i riposte. I had to sacrifice agility all the way down to 77 to get reasonable str, dex and wisdom. Capping it at such a low level is kind of a double penalty - we all have lowish agility because we focus on other stats, and then you cap the skill at low levels anyway...<P><BR>As I posted once before. Your definition of the role of melee classes is ballsed up.<P>Warriors should be the best balance between Defense and offense - 50/50%<BR>Paladins 65/30/5% (5% casting - i rate buffs and stuns as low casting percentage)<BR>Rangers 45/45/10% (10% casting dd,s snares, dots)<BR>SK's    45/40/15% (15% casting lots of dots and dd's)<BR>Monks  35/65%<BR>Rogues 35/65%<BR>Bards  40/40/20% (lots of songs)<P>And so on and so forth.<P>Rebuilding the game to match something like this would give you a very solid and definite sliding scale you could balance your classes on.<P>And is probably impossible to achieve.<P>If it is impossible to achieve, then find a new way to extend paladins usefulness to a group, one that does not impugn upon other melee classes.<P>My only suggestion in this is perhaps a bit of a bardic touch or Aura family. But do NOT use effects from the bardic handbook.<P>Even if you dont agree with my percentage break up on each class, I hope you can see where I think you've gone wrong.<P><BR>Tsunamix Daemonwave<BR>52 paladorf<BR>Bristlebane<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Quick! Someone get a lvl59 paladin, Absor died and lost his level and can no longer get onto the paladin boards! Just kidding, I know he will give us our list soon, as he has been telling the other classes theirs are on the way  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Question for all you paladins out there: Has verant ever adressed paladin issues? I have been reading the more popular web sites for well over a year now, and I have never seen any news where Verant tries to communicate with us.  I have seen issues for all the other classes come and go, but I've always wondered what happened to us ?<P>Anyone else noticed a decline in paladins post 50? I have now seen 2 of my paladins start warriors once they leveld past 50, and another one start a cleric.  On my last 3 Fear raids, i have been the only paladin.  Anyone else seeing this trend ?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>previously posted:<P>&gt;&gt;High elves suck as pally's<P>I have to say you are wrong there.  My paldin is a high elf.  Try having 150 WIS , and then say HIE's suck.<P>Last post on topic, since we will be getting the post by Absor stating his final decision on our posts.<P>Please make a solution so those who want 1hs/shield for Epic.  A quest or some sort of alternative that will be able to switch their 2HS into a Epic 1H/Epic Shield.<P>Please understand our 1hander being high damage will not be overbalancing, since we cannot duel wield and the bash damage is min to none.<P>We will be doing same damage as we did with 2HS, as we bashed also with the 2HS.  Just maybe some more AC, and added proc on the shield.  Haste would be a nice solution w/ some stat buffs on the shield's proc.  Sword also should be changed to a defending proc, as it is the Fiery DEFENDER.<P>More spells useful to a group, AE Group spells that are paladin only that really offer something that a group just cant get by any class.  We need something defining and unique that people can really use that wont be overwritten or not able to cling on the player by a higher buff.<P>Understand, post 50+ mobs have tons of hit points, and hit for quads of 400+! It would not be unbalanced if you worked every epic to a higher damage on each weapon.<P>Yes 35/40 2HS is a great dam/delay ratio!<P>But you can pick up weapons that are abundant in velious for one, among other places that are the same damage or higher just slower delay.<P>The vindication for example, is 35/45 , W/ a CoF or a ENC Buff they will hit just as fast as we do, since our haste is capped. w/ AQ + CoF that person w/ vindication will hit just as fast/hard as I do w/ my Epic. Then theres the Natures Defender its dam 38 , and even tho it is a tad bit slower then our EPIC w/ AQ/CoF they are doing the same speed we are *because of cap* but they are hitting HARDER because they are using a 38 dam weapon vs 35.  These are just examples, but there are TONS like this.<P>Then there is the second situation. Weapons that are lower in damage of say 32- but the delay being as low as 29-36 delay!  I have seen weapons such as 32/39 and there even is a 32/36 that is obtained by 1-2 partys. Again, these weapons w/ AQ/CoF Hit for more/same damage I do w/ my Epic.<P>Ways to make the EPIC weapons just that, EPIC?<P>Up the damage on all the epics, so if someone does get a dam 35 45 weapon, they wont be able to hit hard as our epics , because they are just that EPIC.<P>They can be as fast, but they cant hit as hard, understand my point? In conclusion the harder we hit the more damage we put out, which then balances out to be MORE then that person w/ AQ/CoF w/ his dam 35 weapon, *IF* our epics were increased in damage.<P>What is EPIC? A Damage 39+ Weapon.<P>How often do you see anything 39+ in damage? Not even in pickup groups do you find such weapons. <P>That would be epic.  It is NOT a balance issue either, because mobs in post kunark for example have  TONS of hps, and those kinda mobs arent going to be solo'd by some guy w/ his epic anyways.  Would just be adding more damage to there group/raid situation.<P>So what I am asking, Is to make our Epics truley Epic, instead of watching some guy w/ a.) Higher damage weapon slower delay evened out or faster then I am swinging w/ my Epic, and b.) 35- damage weapon, AQ/CoF hasted with allready delay 32-36 weapon that evens out there damage again, to that of my Epic.<P>Only way to make our Epics, EPIC , is to up the damage on them so your sword you earned and worked so hard on , is truly EPIC and you wont see weapons that are such high damage.<P>Yes keep the delay at 40 or whatever its at for the epics.  Just up there damage.<P>Warriors up theirs to 40-41<BR>Paladins up theirs to 38-39<BR>Shadowknights have 40 damage<P>hope you understand my idea, basically with the weapons out there that are not even NO DROP, are being sold for 15-20K that are outdamaging our Epic weapon, and the same situation goes for anyone w/ an epic Except Monks, and SK *since they have dam 40*<P>Just saying, there is not many 40+ weapons and if it is its monk only or sk epic.  That means our Epics will stay epic.  <P>Armor for a Paladin, currently only way for us to obtain class-only armor is by Questing them.  Other classes are easily able to get in a raid/multi group encounter in PoG and work on a new set of armor.  As for paladins and other classes, are stuck w/ the quest only.  That is fine if the PoG armor drop classes did not have the quest to get the same exact different name armor, but it is not the case.  They can either A.) Quest, or B.) Loot on PoG raid.  Rumour has it that Paladins and the other classes left out in PoG for armor will be able obtain theirs in PoM.  Wooa, Wait a sec! PoM?! Any idea what it takes to GET to PoM?  I wont make a spoiler on your site but you know what I mean ;)  Either Change the difficulty to get there currently that equal to entering PoG, or move the zone alltogether to a equal-risk location.  A easy solution for this is to add a Portal Spell to PoM.<P>Minimal Damage is another thing I would like to suggest upping.  w/ my Epic I slash sometimes and more then often for as low as 22-23 damage!  How could a 35 damage sword hit for any less then 35?  Its just rediculous. Minimal damage needs to be increased.<P>Bash, im 55 and i bash for up to 24 damage *and thats w/ wolf form and superb str buffs*  It would not be un balanced to up the bash damage.  Bashing w/ a Heavy Metal Shield against the head sure would hurt more then a kick IMO.  <P>there is other things I want to touch base with, but I feel others have done a good job on that.  Looking forward to your reply and thank you for spending so much time on all of us silly paladins. /Salute Absor<P>Darkfiend Lightbearer<BR>Loyal Paladin of E'ci<BR>Follower of Na Koa<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Absor,<P>   I am a really depressed about my paladin and I am on the verge of quiting the game, which I guess will not be much of a bad thing, I got a life to live  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif">.  Anyway I have a 51 cavalier... <BR>Cavalier=paladin, and I am having super hard troubles finding groups. Getting on a raid for me is one heck of a task, I am never invited I tell yeah that.  To get my epic I have to get 2 dragon scale books before I turn lvl 53. How am I gonna do this when its hard to even get on a Naggy/Vox raid.<BR>   Another thing when I am in groups I find myself useless most of the time pretty much.<P>If I am only tank in group:<P>Cleric is casting heals on me constantly. The battle is drawn on longer cuase of the fact that I hit about 25% of the time no matter what weapon I use, and I got an fbss at lvl 48 and guess what it barely makes a difference in my offense, Im about to sell it. Anyway with me as only tank the whole group has more downtime period.  Now if I am with a warrior or monk or rouge, and find myself just aiding them barely with my pathetic melee abilities. I swear Absor, mage and necros pets do more damage then I do and I am lvl51. <BR>And I cant taunt worth a crap, so whats the point I find myself not even helping taking the dmg for the warrior, monk, or rouge.<P>To help us compete with other classes here our my suggestions that will solve most of it.<P>Taunt- If verant is going to raise are defense caps to that of a warrior then raise our taunt to that of a warrior becuase we will have more defense but we are not going to take advantage of it if we can not be hit by mobs.<P>Bash- I mean come on us and Sks are the only classes that use shields as weapons, equal this out to a warriors as well.<P>Stun- There is 2 choices, either raise our taunts caps or make are stuns not resisted by 52+ mobs most of the time, this could also make us more valuable in UBER raids and maybe people will look for paladins more in raids. This is also a taunt for us also ) So either makes our stuns better or our taunt. =)<P>Offense- Lol, we need some kinda of cure for our piss poor melee abilities. A mage or necro pet can out dmg my cavalier. Something is wrong with that. I suggest either raising the cap or getting us some better available. A fast 1hs would be nice, I mean SKS get the Nocbladeand MoSS and a much batter variety of 1hs that our easier to get. The SotM is one hell of a hard to sword to get in Seb and is very rare. Our pal weapon Waterspinkler is found in PoH. And it is not as good as the Moss and that is found in CoM. Anyways our offense needs work for sure.<P>Defense- I am happy with the change in our defense that is coming up!<P>Magic- Lol, our magic is nice to buff newbies thats for sure =) I guess paladins as casters job is to power level the newbies and buff the Weak! Yippee! Moving Aof to 49 helps yes. That lvl 50 spell is joke! I am not even going to buy it or hunt for it and I will never use it probaly. Our 50+ spells are not that useful unless grouped without a cleric. And well lol, being grouped without a cleric at lvls 50+ is very rare. So what are we back up buffers, Our heal spell at lvl 51 just is no good, I cant even heal a tank comepletey even when fom becuase I ran out of mana. I suggest like many others, stackable buffs, and maybe even making the divine purpose spell not self only anymore ? That could help us get into groups maybe?<P>Well that about sums it up, I just wanted to give you my ideas, so when I quit this game and look back... and say well at least I spoke up.  To tell you the truth this whole game is screwed up. When verant made the classes he should not have came up with the hybrid system, AND GOD KNOWS WHY he gave a Hybrid exp pentaly, hybrids have always been crappy compared to others so why do that!?<P>Paladins should be paladins, they should have their own line of spells and abilties like all other video games I have played. Same goes for the other hybrids. They should not be called hybrids in the first place! Where is your creativity Verant? In most role play games paladins have a rough early and mid life.. but when they are a high level they are supposed to be real powerful becuase of the hardship they went thru. *cough* Like the 45 lvls I played under an exp pentalty. Anyway I think I will find another game to play soon if I do not see changes in the Class system of this game, Lol I will find a multi-player role-playing game that is a lot cheaper then this one  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"><P>51 Cavalier<P>Follow of Marr<P>PS-I will not give up yet but if I do not start having fun soon with my paladin then its game over.

</FONT><HR>Suggested changes:<P>- raise Bash skill cap to Warrior level.  Bash is to Paladins (and SKs) as Archery is to Rangers.  Rangers have as high an Archery skill as Warriors, why shouldn't Paladins (who, along with SKs, are the most frequent users of the Bash skill, by far) have as high a Bash skill as Warriors?<P>- add Lay Hands II at 51 (3K hit points, 60 minute recast time), Lay Hands III at 55 (4K hit points, 45 minute recast), and Lay Hands IV at 60 (5K hit points, 30 minute recast).  Add similar changes for SK's Harm Touch skill.  These changes are invisible to the user, who simply continues to use his/her Lay Hands skill.<P>- Dodge and Parry raised to be at least as high as Rangers.  As the defensive hybrid, you'd think these defensive skills would be even higher, or we'd be given a corresponding offensive advantage over Rangers in a secondary skill.<P>- Holyforge discipline dropped in favor of a Defensive discipline.<P>- critical hits given at 55, critical blows at 60<P>- remedy the difference in our hit points and armor vs Warriors by either giving us a supplemental Epic Weapon quest that lets us trade in our 2-hander for a shield/sword combo, or unique (Paladin-only) buffs that specically address our armor class and hit point deficiencies.  The reasoning behind this request is that Rangers have offensive equipment as good as Warriors, why don't Paladins (and SKs) have defensive equipment as good as Warriors?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057639-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057639.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057639-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/057639-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057639&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=057639&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
