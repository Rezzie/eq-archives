</FONT><HR>In response to...<P>I am know what bards get from the enhanced speed their drums give them for their movement songs. I would argue that the speed without them, however, is still faster than Spirit of Wolf. I understand that you are all used to a greater speed. But, be honest with yourselves and with me, is this really that much more than an inconvenience? Does fixing a bug that affects two songs warrant taking the servers down for several hours for our entire customer base? We don’t think it does.<P>Please try to do homework before posting things like this.  I would argue that, if all this did was nerf our speed, it is enough.  My speed is more than a "convenience..." it's a strategy.  I often have to "split" multiple mobs.  What I do in this situation is cast Largo's on one mob, then kick in Selo's and run.  With practice, only the un-snared mob will come.  The lesser speed makes a HUGE difference in mob-splitting.<P>This nerf hurt in more than simply speed, however.  Bards have several spell lines, and 2 of our most important are our resist debuff/dot's, and our resistance buffs.  When fighting dragons or mobs with massive AE attacks, bards are actually wanted to boost resistances.  Unfortunately, both of these lines use the Percussion skill.  Also, some haste songs use Percussion.  And finally, my main AC/AGI buff uses Percussion.<P>Basically, you nerfed my...<P>1.  Speed.<BR>2.  DoT's.<BR>3.  Debuffs.<BR>4.  Resistance Buffs.<BR>5.  Haste.<BR>6.  Party-Wide Buffs.<P>And you say this isn't major, and I should just wait til next patch?  I'm sorry, I heartily disagree.  Look at what you took away from me, and please reconsider.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

There are ways to get around this bug for a few days.  Learn new strategies.  Take a break for a couple days.  Play a twink.  It's not the end of the world.

</FONT><HR>Tandial:  I don't have anything against bards.  I have a couple of friends that play them.  I have something against foolish and childish bards that feel the need to start new threads on the same subjects every hour on the hour, and then claim that this minor bug should cause the entire EQ population to stop playing for 10 hours, when another patch is imminent to fix other serious bugs.<P>Lyrical:  That's funny.  You can't answer the questions posed, or respond on why the whole of the servers ought to stop just because a few players can't do everything they'd like for a few days.  That is both foolish and selfish.  Your actions have been foolish and childish.  Keep ignoring reason and logic.  It'll do you well.<P>Trainspotter/Eryl:  It isn't going to be a bug for weeks.  There are multiple bug fixes in the works, and this fix is awaiting the completion of those others.  Patience is a virtue.  It'll get fixed soon.  It sucks that the many past instances of phantom nerfs caused Verant to ignore the Test server /bug reports, but they've acknowledged the problem now and will fix it.  Don't quit.

</FONT><HR>Phelan... me and 18 people have corpses stuck in Plane of Growth right now because of this bug.  Minor, huh??  Stop being a troll please and understand I know what I am talking about.  It is about 30%, because right now, PoGs move same speed as me, before I could easily whip circles around them and lose them out of sight in a matter of seconds.  I could give you the discrete calculations, but let me just say, that before bug, my song was faster than a level 60 SoC (tested).  Now it is about same speed as a level 60 SoW (tested).  Level 60 SoW is a +55% movement.  Level 60 SoC is a +115 or 135% movement, need to look that up.  So saying that we lost 4+ hours on CR tonight then ended up leaving 18 corpses in the zone, just because I couldn't help the clerics survive, and then trying to say it is minor is absurd.<P>Dolphin Oceansinger</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Phelan42:<P>"I'm sorry if I disagree that the whole game ought to be shut down for the problem of a tiny fraction of the EQ population."<P>Ummm, it's more than just a tiny fraction... it's bards and all other players that group with bards.  Could easily end up being 1/2 to 3/4 of the server population depending on how long this is unresolved.<P>"My class/level is irrelevant to that."<BR> <BR>If your going to speak like an authority on the issue, then yes your class/level is relevant.  Sometime second-hand knowledge & repeat what ya read just isn't good enough.<P>"What do I need to prove I know? There isn't anything about the intricacies of your class involved in this thread." <P>Again, if all you do is read, and repeat... you end up saying crap like this.  I can mem 8 songs, since getting this song at level 5 I can honestly say there has not been 8 straigh hours that I did not use this song.  I have used for combat, for convience, for groupping and for soloing.  There are songs I have never memmed more than 5 times.  Saying there isn't anything about the intricacies  involved in playing a bard here is just plain WRONG.  This whole topic is about playing a bard.<P>"It's gonna get fixed, and pretty soon. There are several other fixes in the works."<P>We don't know when, so we can't say pretty soon.  This statement is as valid as someone saying the bug will be live for 6 months... we don't know.<P>"Should they shut down the servers for 10 hours tomorrow just for you guys, when they'll have to do it again on Friday or Monday? Of course not. Stop being so selfish."<P>Two things... put yourself in a bards shoes for 2 minutes... group with a bard for 2 hours... the fix is not just for bards, it's for the all of the paying customers that group with bards.  Finally, don't buy into what Verant's all vrs. bards crap.  If you repeat what Absor wrote, and look at the last patch, it just don't jive.  Is the emergency patch REALLY going to mean hours of downtime?

I have always been one to give VI the benefit of the doubt, and even with all the song issues, I have always maintained that there is no better class to add to any group than a bard.<P>That's probably still true if you just do Veran't dungeon style camping in one spot for 8 hours to get phat_uber_lewt.<P>Ironically, this is what Verant tries to fight, but at the same time, they force us to stick to this aged, boring method.<P>However, using our typical tactics for outdoor fighting is now out of the question.  Yes, I can adjust fairly easily, it's my job.  This whole situation proves to me that Verant still hasn't learned what customer's want.<P>We have a test server.  Why is it even there?  What is the use of the test server if Verant doesn't even listen to the bug reports coming out?<P>Is an emergency patch needed to fix this issue?  I don't know, I'll just continue to post here and my server boards rather than play mostly.  <P>As an aside, Everyone I have talked to wouldn't mind an emergency patch because the dragons and gods have already fallen this week, and with all the epic quest pieces that drop off these mobs, I think most would actually rejoice.<P>Zurin Cosmosis<BR>52 Disgruntled Bard<BR>Officer of Last Hope<P>My brain is just a jellyfish in the oceans of my head.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Go on strike. If you are dying on the planes raids, because of this lack (i know NOTHING about playing a high level bard, i'm only 25) explain to your guild you can't go. Trying to do your job while bugged is giving verant the impression you CAN do your job while bugged. I explained to my regular grouping partners that I was sorry, but i wouldn't be playing the bard until Selo's is fixed. My true friends understood and support me in this.<P>I hope I didn't come off sounding bossy, that wasn't my intent.

</FONT><HR>     When I look at this issue all I see is a further suggestion that most of Verant has little understanding of bards.  If you did I don't see how you could call drum speed "just a convenience"; it seems most bards here and most bards I know would disagree.  Just because I'm still faster than SoW isn't enough.  I'm not built around being just a bit faster than SoW, but rather faster than SoC (spirit of cheetah).  Bards don't get a lot of defensive abilities, or many hitpoints, or any innate resistances; our best defense is being able to get away FAST.  SoW just isn't enough: there are mage pets that can outrun by sung Selo's speed easily, and enough aggro mobs to cause serious trouble.  Now sure,  I can still group in a dungeon quite effectively, but not everyone likes to do that.  Juggling 3 songs in a constant-pull group gets boring to me (I can't talk to people b/c I have to keep songs up),  and is very tiring on my hands.  Soloing lets me go at my own pace and have fun, but usually means kiting at my lvl (52), which I can't do at just faster than SoW speed.  Imagine if druids had to kite with just SoW and no snare.  Of course the counter argument for that would be that bards have two target snares--well we do,  but if I have to play speed and snare, then I can only keep one damage song going--not a very effecient way to kill something.<BR>    Ok, after that bit of ranting I guess I should clarify my standpoint on the issue, and why I'm upset.  I'm not mad that the bug came into the game,  I can understand that things like this will happen, and have no problem with it.  I also can understand that you would not want to bring down all the servers for just a small portion of the customer base, though I don't like it.  What really bothers me is that I get the idea from that you consider this to be almost a minor trivialty, not sucha  big deal.  I've been presented with so many situations where it seems that bards aren't understood by Verant--the AC on imbrued and SS armors (not to mention that as a foraging class said armor lets us summon food/water),  when you nerfed snare+fear and had no idea that chain was better than necro/druid snares, a couple instances where you changed your mind about how a song should work and afterwards your PR people just assumed that the previous functioning was bugged (Like the original Selo's).  Now some of that might have just been PR errors, but I think you guys should understand why we get so frustrated.  Imagine how wizards would feel if the impression they received from Verant was that no one there understood they were nukers,  or clerics healers, etc., even if it was just a PR problem, you can imagine how frustrated they would become. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>If Verant are going to continue to treat this mistake as a "minor inconvenience" then at least have the decency to tell us when you're going to re-patch.<P>Any more than a week or two of having broken Percussion effects is definitely not a "minor inconvenience".  If I have to suffer this "minor inconvenience" that long, I'll have to let my guild and friends know not to expect me on any outdoor excursions.<P>You see?  It's not just Bards who are affected by this, but also the people we group with.  I had to turn down invitations to groups in Burning Woods and Trakanon's Teeth last night - so because Selo's is broken, they had to do without my buffs and clarity regen as well as my speed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Dang.  Hit the wrong button.  To continue....<P>Please read Akhamar's post.  He's right.  My complaint with you guys is your selfish demand to terminate the game so you can get your minor bug fixed while other bug fixes are in the works, as well as the childish tantrums.  <P>Trainspotter:  No, it is not like saying the bug will be around for 6 months, as Verant has said they are working on a new patch for this and other bugs.  The continued use of ridiculous extremes only makes your position look even less valid.  5 minute emergency patches have always been for specific zones or servers to be rebooted, not patches to how the game works.  If it was 5 minutes, it would have been done.  See, Verant wants to make you folks happy, just not at the expense of the 98% of the players that don't play bards.  5 minutes isn't a problem.  10 hours is.  Diminishing returns and all that.<P>I'm sorry if this bug has caused you folks to die.  However, as you've had plenty of warning, you should have changed your tactics rather than relying upon the same ol' actions.  Don't hunt in PoG for a few days.  It won't kill you.<P>For those that say half the population or more relies upon Selo's, that's hysterical and absolute crap.  I've grouped with plenty of bards in 16 months, and I think I've had the benefits of Selo's twice.  And that was just a lark.  Again, silly exaggeration makes you less credible.<P>Zurin:  I never said there were a lot of bards "on my side."  As you've admitted, a couple have come into these threads and said that the bug isn't crippling and isn't worth an emergency 10 hour patch.  Others have said that the childish tactics of starting new threads every 20 minutes (like Tuesday) or every hour (like Wednesday) was wrong.  As we know that it is mostly squeaky wheels that come here, it stands to reason that there are plenty of other bards that haven't found this crippling.<P>Trainspotter:  You miss the point about my "intricacies" comment.  I am not saying that Selo's isn't a significant portion of a bard's repertoire.  I am saying that there isn't anything about it to which only bards would be privy.  I know it's used a lot.  Even with the loss of the percussion bonus, it'll still be used a lot.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Hey Phelen go play a bard on PvP server and let me know how it feels after you didnt have time to evade that last Ice commet because of a minor inconvenience. Its bard hunting season there and all random loot pks know we are an easier target then usual because of a bug. Its silly that I have to hide in desolate areas because I cannot get out of cast range of a jbooted wiz, necro, or sown druid. <P>The pve aspect for me is not a big deal. I can adjust, but PvP forget it. Im not going to lose items I have aquired to something I have no control over. Selos with drum is vital to bard existence in PvP. I have seen many bard companions Pked with in the last few days and lost valuable items because their escape has been greatly reduced by a drum bug. /shrug what an inconvenience. Incase you have not noticed, bards DO NOT have an extreme amount of dmg output. Selos is the key factor when going toe to toe with casting classes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

In cases like that, I'm the elected puller.  Pulling with a broken Selo's against SoWd mobs is tantamount to suicide for a Bard.  One bash and we're stunned, our song drops.  Chain-stun the Bard and we can't start our song, never mind move.<P>For now, I'd rather not take the risk.<P>Please collect the facts before you accuse me of being dumb.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Phelan, let me ask you a question, and I'll put it in terms of lower levels so it has a greater applicability across the board.<P>Suppose clerics suddenly had their Healing spell disabled so they could only use Light Healing.  Is that a serious enough bug to warrant bringing the servers down for an emergency patch?<P>Disabling the drum effects on a bard's speed song is analogous to that.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/046807-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/046807.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/046807-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/046807-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/046807-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=046807&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=046807&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
