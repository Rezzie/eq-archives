</FONT><HR>Actually Azhami, <P>I'm more interested in whiny clerics retiring.  I don't mind the average cleric.  My guildmates are fine, my friends are fine, and I'm sure the vast majority of clerics are fine.  It's the ones that keep griping because Shams and Druids want to be viable healers in the high end game.  THEY are the ones that bug, and personally...I don't *CARE* if THOSE clerics retire.<P>Sub</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>How come no cleric player has yet responded to any of the times it was mentioned that despite having other abilities if a druid or shaman is primary healer in a group they are doing exactly the same job as a cleric only not as good as a cleric?<BR>You cannot debuff/DS, DOT/nuke and heal at the same time without going OOM way to quick to be of help to your group(also the need for saving mana for evac). <BR>Cleric will always be the preferred healer, their buffs + heals + rez combination is unmatched even with the enhancements to druids and shamans. This is what you decided to be when you started a cleric so don't complain about your 'job' in a group.<BR>Your role has not changed and that is all that matters, ask for fun enhancements if that helps but don't get upset when another class is enhanced it makes you all sound like jealous little children. I suggest making undead DDs better and perhaps some other anti-undead enhancements but nothing outside of the cleric's role in EQ.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok the point that many of you have missed is that someone tried to agrue the point that Shamans or Druids in groups now as primary healers will be doing the same sit/med/heal/dodge attacks/die that the clerics are doing as well.  <BR>The issue is actually when you have a druid or shaman in the group and you have a choice between a cleric or another druid or shaman who do you pick well then it becomes a hard decision why because 1 shaman or Druid might be able to handle primary healer as well as the cleric could and you now have a second utility class that can back up the healing if necessary thats the problem the<BR>only time a cleric will be wanted is against UBER mobs or when there are ressurections required.<P>By this patch all healing classes have been nerfed this is very true but the point that is being made is that the Cleric has no full proof escape method sure we have DA/DB that are once off spells and take a long regen time so unless you want to wait 20 minutes after each kill (nice downtime hay) you gonna take the druid/shaman who can outrun the mob, snare it, have his pet taunt it off him giving enough time for others to gain enough hate or evacuate the group when the you know what really hits the fan.<BR>This is the point that clerics are trying to make here the outcry is that they nerfed the one thing we did well in the game and in return we got nothing back. Not one utility type thing that is useful many clerics asked for invisibility for example for safer travel in zones sounds reasonable but that was ignored.  Many clerics explained the high cost of regeants in spells that also was ignored.  Clerics explained that they couldn't even melee low level green at higher levels to death yet they are suppose to be a melee priest?  This is the whole basis behind the hewn cry from clerics we have yet again been nerfed without remorse or advantage.<P>Druids might say that the DOT nerf was a big nerf well let me remind you now that SNARE STACKS with ROOT hmmmm is it any longer a issue nope just snare mob, DOT mob, root MOB you spell does full damage......<P>Mages say that they don't have much but I would say this I would prefer a mage with a mage pet in my party now as it definitely has a better taunt that all the other pets and melee classes in the game I a more likely to survive with a mage pet around (I KNOW THIS FROM EXPERIENCE).<P>The whole point of these threads is to get Verant to realise that they have just reduced the total effectiveness of all Healing Classes in the game but the biggest impact on anyone class was on the Clerics because it WAS and STILL is the only thing that they can do well (IF THEY STAY ALIVE).<P>People that aren't seeing this as the bigger picture are blind and need to have their eyes checked.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>After playing both my 50+ warrior and my 50+ cleric last night, I've decided to start playing my 50+ druid exclusively.  Here's why...<P>I was in HS with some friends as my cleric.  My level 57 tank friend pulls 3 mobs.  Normally this is not a big deal for 55+ characters to handle.  After eating 3 new and improoved SK HT and running back to the group, I'm forced to throw a CH as he's almost empty.  Now I'm getting killed by all three mobs.  The warrior now has to attempt to taunt three mobs off me (yeah right) while the enchanter attempts to mez.  I divine and the enchanter is able to mez, but at this rate we can pull about once every 15 minutes.  What was my alternative.  Any effective heal, Divine Heal for instance, would have easily generated a crapload more agro then the warrior had been able to generate with his bow.  I played for about an hour, it sucked royally and I logged.  Enter the warrior.<P>Take warrior to Karnor to camp DC.  While setting up, we are agroed by 3 mobs.  As I'm just about to die the cleric lands a CH healing me for about 3k in healin.  Wups, big mistake on his part, now he's getting beat on by 3 angry dogs.  I have to attempt to taunt 3 mobs off the cleric (yeah right).  The enchanter attempts to mez, but gets resisted once.  Now the enchanter AND the cleric are getting squashed into oblivion.  The cleric dies cause I can't taunt, the enchanter dies cause the cleric can't heal, everyone else zones.  After CR I log, what a joke.<P>I cancelled the cleric account in protest.  First of all, playing the cleric had become a bit boring, and with the new changes it's completely changed my class.  I actually haven't played my cleric in the last 3 or 4 weeks.  I haven't wanted to quit this bad since I was getting hyper agroed in Mistmoore for using greater heal.  At level 54 my druid has semi effective heals, but I'll probably still solo.  I see groups in Seb, Karnor and pretty much every other 50+ dungeon having problems adjusting to how crappy the new taunt system is so why bother risking my neck to heal a chanter going down cause he was resisted on a mez.  If I do I will CERTAINLY be agroed.<P>While the Celestial line may be a path to the light for Clerics, the second installment comes far too late in the game to make the growing pains from 51 to 59 bearable.  Reduce Elixer to 54 or 55 and perhaps Clerics will be as effective as they should be.  I for one won't group my Cleric as I play the last couple months as my subscription runs out.

Whereas before we were sitting at zone lines waiting for groups as warriors piled in, the paladins stunning/taunting ability will make them needed.  As someone on the Paladins of Norrath message board stated (sorry I dont remember name hehe) it's sad that Verant nerfs almost every other class to make paladins balanced.<P>Bora</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

I have absolutely no problems handling multiples in those dungeons as a 55 enchanter. Plan ahead a little and be prepared for multiple incoming is all, try new tactics, if you had time to cast a ten second CH you sure had time to root/park, or stun and help chanter mez.

</FONT><HR>Listen up, we'll only say this 1 more time:<P>Druids at level 60 and a Cleric at level 60 have the EXACT SAME COMBAT HEALING POWER.  Druids actually have more because of their clarity buff.<P>Why is this?  Because WITH the healing aggro change, CH is now death for a cleric.  That means clerics can't use anything more efficient than SH/DL/Remedy to heal in battle.  Wow, guess what, a DR00D has all those spells to.  Both have 200 wisdom, AND the druid has a HP buff that adds mana regen if above and beyond what a bard/chanter gives...so in a longer battle, the DR00D has more mana, and between battles, the DR00D meds back up faster.<P>Shamans got screwed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>- Druids/shaman are given some cleric heal spells.<P>- No big deal, clerics are still far and away ahead of druids/shaman due to CH.<P>- Mobs agro changed so that castng CH often means death the cleric wich is often followed by the death of their group mates.<P>- Clerics now use CH less and more often use the same spells as druids/shaman use to heal for the safety of their party and themselves.<P>-Druids/shaman retain their usefulness as before but now can heal 75% as well as a cleric.<P> Does this make it clearer now as to why clerics may be a tad upset? <P> Besides, it was druids/shaman that taught us all that 'the greasy wheel gets the grease'. So be happy wth your new abilites but back off a little bit please and let us vent some steam.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>ok Celestial healin/elixer is not a defining part of a cleric anymore, can you say cloroblast? and as far as res's go, necros and palys have 90-93% exp res now, best clerics get is 96. Yes everyone dies, but if the cleric dies its back to the begingin for everyone, or you get a pay/necro to res them in, clerics will get shafted with lower exp res, while everyone else gets the bigger one. not much but it stacks up, and we lvl slower. Hrmm, there realy isnt much of a defining role for clerics anymore. The spells that would do it, get us killed. <P>solution: learn to work with the shaman/druids/palys. have that paly save the LoH for the clerics, they will need it most. teach your half classes to play. Teach your druid/shaman to be healers not just buffers and doters. have more than one priest class in you groups, and share the healing. VI is not going to change it. learn to work with it or quit. Yes now there wil be even more druids. they can solo and are now more usefull in groups than they used to be. Clerics still have the best heals in the game, now they just cant use them at any time like they used to. You cant realy use cleric as second character anymore, you will need to pay more attention to him. Yes It will screw us over, but those that love playing a cleric will stay and be in more demand now. I think the change was needed, but we got stiffed in all the changes made along with the warriors. I think they made warrior taunt too low now, and made heal agro too high. it needs to have a little adjustment to it, maybe cut the hate over 800 in half (ie. if its 1600 for over 50 make it 1200) and give warriors a taunt cap increase. Warriors over 50 get cap moved to 275 or just add 3 taunt increase per lvl over 50.<P>this would be great, and give us something better than the celestial heal/elixir, such as a group Celestial of the same hp regen as cel heal. but dont up the agro, Cel heal is a great spell, it gives a chance to get off a CH, put it in group form, and you can heal others, it will never take the place of any direct heal spell in major combat past lvl 50, mobs hit too hard and players will die if used as one. Cel heal is a way to heal up the not so agroed players and give time to get off a CH or 2 to the ones that are, the CH Sh aplied after will cause enough agro to get us killed. please listen VI.<P><BR>Can we get a group Cel heal with out added agro for everyone we heal with it??? like I said it cant replace CH/SH in combat. As well as the CH/SH that follow to the tanks will get us enough agro anyway. this will also give players a reason to create clerics again. Leave the agro the same as the single target Cel heal, and we will thank you greatly, or I will at least. even if the other agro is not changed.<P>Please listen VI<P>Thanks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

The Big Picture.<P>Get rid of all other classes, everyone plays a druid and all classes are balanced. Easy and so simple.<P>All casters have just about given up (chanters seem the hardiest here, probably because druids still want clarity until its in their spell book), clerics are retiring everywhere so we have shaman and druids as healers. All tank classes are slowly combining.<P>See its going well, if you want to balance the easiest way is to get rid of all other classes  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

Wanna see the druid class fall by about 50%.....give everyone Teleports....but Verant can't do that as running from area to area and zone to zone wastes the most time in the game....period. Can't tell ya how much fun it is to die with my warrior twink.....then run back to corpse w/o sow, or J-Boots, and to top  it off, I'm bound 5 zones away cause it's the closest place (Love Velious and Kunark for this mega time sink).

</FONT><HR>Lol the funniest think I've seen in awhile was the whole thing about trying to cast a CH on a tank being hit by quad 500's. <P>Lets think about this. Can any other heal any game besides CH keep up with that damage? No. So of course it's possible to do and in fact CH is the only way possible to kill many of the uber mobs because no other heal can keep up with quad 500 damage.<P>Now as far as balance goes simply return the aggro healing back to the way it was. Clerics will heal better with CH and druids and shamans will be able to fill the spot of a cleric in a exp group which was sorely needed.<P>Naeeldar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>All I have to say about Druids is, when your guild say's:<P>"Hey Clerics are useless, lets have them go take the Death Touch"<P>THEN I will agree with you. Why don't you try playing a high level druid before you start jabbering away. Clerics are probably the single most usefull class in the game. That can be debated of course, but none the less close to the truth. Would you even include Druid's in the top 50%? I doubt it, when it comes to high level encounters, were just a death touch machine. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Re:  Bateq's above post, (in this same thread):<P>/q<BR>Listen up, we'll only say this 1 more time:<P>Druids at level 60 and a Cleric at level 60 have the EXACT SAME COMBAT HEALING POWER. Druids actually have more because of their clarity buff.  Why is this? Because WITH the healing aggro change, CH is now death for a cleric. That means clerics can't use anything more efficient than SH/DL/Remedy to heal in battle.  Wow, guess what, a DR00D has all those spells to. Both have 200 wisdom, AND the druid has a HP buff that adds mana regen if above and beyond what a bard/chanter gives...so in a longer battle, the DR00D has more mana, and between battles, the DR00D meds back up faster.<BR>/q<P>I am not flaming Bateq here, I am genuinely curious to know... is this true?<P>Because if it is, discounting Complete Heal, a druid has comparable/ better capabilities as a healer than a cleric does.  Certainly that is not balanced.<P><BR>Jesper, (who has been insta - summoned/ killed after casting one Remedy!)<BR>Daryu,<BR>Tannen,<BR>etc.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Verant seems to conceed the nerf on clerics.<P>Not sure I agree with the idea that if there are not enough of one class you improve other classes to fill the breach though. Isn't the "economy" supposed to be able to generate sufficient clerics. If not maybe clerics need to be made more attractive (how about a "convert" spell?).<P>But I do not oppose druids and shaman getting better healing. In fact I cant begrudge any class for getting improved. What I begrudge is a class getting nerfed.<P>Problem I see is that unless the CH aggro is dramatically altered it is really not just a nerf on clerics. I suspect in the long run it is a nerf of the warrior class. Warriors "take damage". <P>One buffed warrior at a bubble of life will still take about half a mana bar for a druid or shaman to heal ... maybe more depending on level. <P>Whether it is a druid, shaman or cleric healing, if CH is out it is better to have a tank who takes less damage, has less HPs and has more taunt ability.<P>This is just a thought based on a few unproven assumptions and of course has nothing to do with the very high end game. But for our experience groups maybe this is all about rangers? GOSH, BOGGLE . Would be nice if those poor folk got a break after all this time.<P>Would just love to see it done (whatever "it" may be) without nerfing classes.<P>_____________________<BR>Napper<BR>57 Cleric on Xev</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">
