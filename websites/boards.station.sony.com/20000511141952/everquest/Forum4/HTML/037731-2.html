</FONT><HR>SOE*Station Ever = RoK <BR>23.31 = billed amt <BR>4/13/00 = the date billed (same as mine)<P>Now I have been calling the Shipping since two weeks ago. Up until yesterday I was never in the order system, and yes I was one of the unfortunate to order my copies the same day the store went online (April 6th).<P>I faxed by CC billing statement last Friday! Here it is Tuesday and my CD's still have not gone out! WTFO!. I have been fortunate enough that ever time I have called I actually got through and the individual on the other end of phone was curtious, but TOTALLY INEFFECTIVE to resolving my plight. <P>Yes this is just a dam game! But, it is a PRODUCT that was purchased, promised and delivery has been unfulfilled, period! And, I will carry on this way with any PRODUCT that I buy/charge that has been promised and not delivered within the specified time frame.<P>I was told (by Art) "we are 30+ miles from the shipping warehouse and have no communications with them to expedite any order". Is this the stone-age or something, OMG! this is totally unacceptable.<P>By the way, fax your CC statement showing that you were billed to "Kevin" @ 925-686-0578, and pray for some luck.<P>Just to give you, and Verant, a good example of customer support. Last Friday (4/28) I called Western Digital for a replacement HD that was under warranty, 15 minutes before closing time. Guess what! Monday morning @ 10 am a package arrived at my door with my replacement HD (California to Alabama) .... Verant there is an example of prompt replay and customer service.<P>And NO I DO NOT CONSIDER MYSELF ONE OF THE UNLUCKY ONES!!!!!! I consider myself one of the many who were screwed by a TOTAL BS operation. <P>By still not being able to venture to the new Lands (almost 30 days after ordering and almost two weeks after opening); I like many others have missed out .... hmmm let me see what was that prophetic statement ... get there soon before loot gets NERFED! .... ummm adjusted.<P>Yes my tone is harsh and yes I AM VERY VERY VERY PISSED. And, no reimburshment of shipping and a month of free game play is not going to appease me. PERIOD!!!!!<P><BR>Flame out ! <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>You knew that they were gonna sucker you all to buy the expansion with great loot.  Like they didnt know what was gonna drop or how often, please.  <P>I liked the fact that you could have a chance at a great weapon without having to get killed 35 times.  <P>I saw a few post above that kinda upset me.  They wer the ones that said, Hey theres still to much loot dropping.  That equates to, I am in an uber guild and have the best loot so please don't let anyone else be as strong as me.  This is selfish.  I know you put a lot of time getting items in the old eq.  I did too, but I like seeing people get new great loot.  I have all kinds of goods in the bank that lost major resale value.  <P>Also, not all players can be in uber guilds and have every pally in them with a FA.   Its nice that you can get a group of 50's from you r guild and have a shot at a neat item.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>--snip--<BR>Please, lets not look at this as people who got there later getting hurt, but perhaps as people who got there sooner getting lucky.<P>-Gordon<BR>--snip--<P>Well, as far as I'm concerned ... I really got hosed.  I'm sure everyone else who received their shipments late feel the EXACT same way.<P>I watched with great dismay on April 24th as I saw the number of 51(s) grow.  I heard with great disappointed about all the great items being found on Kunark.  Of course I was happy for the guildmates who were there.  However, these are the same folks that have mega-items where I don't have much since I don't often loot.<P>So for those of us that have received delayed shipments of CDs, we now have:<P>1.  catch up to in-game friends (several are almost done with 51 ... then again, they play way too much to have a real life)<BR>2.  no chance again for the decent loot randomly dropping<BR>3.  no chance to bind at the wondrous room<P>Why doesn't Verant understand?  Sometimes the items really do help everyone enjoy the game.  You should be in groups when they obtain an item.  However, if you are the same group with someone who has been trying for an item for weeks, well, you feel sorry for that person.  If Verant really wants things to be rare, make them only GM event attainable.  Otherwise, please let folks explore and kill things, get good items, then explore more.<P>Ah well.

</FONT><HR>You just know Im not writing to congratulate Verant dont you?<P>Ok I can see the logic in changing the loot tables. The price of so many mainland items fell dramatically overnight. Who wants to buy a Crystalline Blade for 800pp when a Jade Green Broadsword drops more frequently and has a far better delay?  This causes problem as players selling older items suddenly find that their weeks of camping items has become fruitless. Why would Verant want to make items drop better than plane armour in a non plane zone. Hey a newbie with an invis could be wearing plane type gear in seconds.<P>The loot from what I hear from my guild was fabulous and as such was unbalanced with the rest of the game and the fact that there were 5 people in Lower Guk this sunday reflects that. Now things are being changed to compensate.<P>We werent unlucky that Verant made an error in shipping. It shows what is in my opinion one of the worst customer relations efforts to have existed. Verant seem to me to be a bunch of the proverbial jeans wearing, coke drinking teenagers that we see on television. Not imaginative people with a goal im forming a well run business. The only reason that EQ still makes money is the fact that Asherons Call is so abysmal. <P>It all comes in circles that many other companies are now working on online role playing games and it cannot be long before a new game comes along that wont have to be better than EQ. It may only have to be as good but fairer. Verant in my opinion are a company that will be dead within three years. I just dont see that the "vision" is at all realistic. Rumours have it that Lucas Interactive are rethinking their commitment to Verant. And before we hear your statement on this Abashi believe me when I say im more clued up on this than you are.<P>I ordered my CD on april the 6th and it arrived 4 days after the turn on but due to my lower level im just as screwed as those who decide not to buy RoK until september. The loot will never be as good as it was. Interstingly enough I also purchased a copy of EQ from EB world on that same day for my younger brother. It arrived the next day in Manchester England. So dont gimme any of that crap about the distance involved. Im sure your mistaking that with the level of customer support involved.<P>In Britain we have a consumer law that states that a product must be effective in the manner in which it is advertised and that barring any technical or legal faults it must be equal for all users.<P>Now Im not sure if my understanding of the law is correct but that means that if a car can go 90MPH for one person it must do 90MPH for the next. Surely this applies to EQ RoK that it should not be different to different players based on the time which it was used but the manner. We understand that things must be random but the variables must remain the same. You screwed us. End of story.<P>Roll on the day when a well run game hits the market. For all shall dance upon the grave of Verant.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>I seriously hope they do rethink giving the Star Wars game to Verant.  I would hate to sit by and watch them screw it up the same way they seem determined to screw up EQ.  I am thinking e-mail campaign from us to whoever is in charge of giving them this contract begging not to let them screw up Star Wars would be the best thing we could possibly do.  Stamp out the disease known as Verant before they defile the gaming community any further.

</FONT><HR>This is the very first post I have ever made an one of these boards.  I doubt very seriously that it will be read, and it may be quite redundant as I neglected to read a large bulk of the posts in this thread myself.  However, I would like to say that the whole rare spawn / rare drop system is bunk.  In eq the way things are, if you are a casual gamer it is quite possible you will be a mid thirties character still in leather wielding a rusty short sword.  The game demands that you sit in one spot for hours on end in order to get a piece of sought after equipment, or pay an outrageous fee to someone who did.  Certainly you want some items to be unique, but the fact is you will see a level 1 wielding these items over a mid level character just because the player of the level one has the lack of real life involvement/patience to sit in one spot for 11 hours.  There are never going to be any unique items, and if there are they are not going to be that way long.  The system of rare drops/rare spawns is a totally unecessary and detrimental part of the eq environs, and I hope it is not the undoing of an otherwise great game.  This is going to be my only post here most likely, as I have said my peace, so flame up ; )</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>&gt;&gt;&gt;Please, lets not look at this as people who got there later getting hurt, but perhaps as people who got there sooner getting lucky.<P>So Abashi, what you're saying is that those who got the CD *ON TIME*, not *EARLY* mind you, are the lucky ones?(I'll even count those who got it on/before the 28th as "on time"). I received my CD on the 1st of May, 1 week after the day I was supposed to receive it, please tell me what I am supposed to consider myself, if not unlucky?<BR>It's not the loot that's the problem, I have things few people have on my server, but it's the fact that once the *majority* has tasted Kunark(yes I'll even consider that your estimates were correct and most people got their CDs before the 28th) the rest were just cast aside, and told to look upon those who got their CDs on time, as lucky. I don't want the loot tables changed, in fact, that's what I believed they should've been from the beginning, since the items that have been dropping makes god/dragon ones obsolete.<BR>I see 2 reasons how this could've happened:<BR>1)You did the loot tables so that they would drop a lot in the first place, to attract people from the overcrowded dungeons of Antonica. Which is understandable to a point, but if loot is the lure you need to get people to come to Kunark, there are other underlying problems.<P>2)An honest to God mistake, in which case, your blatant disregard for those who got it LATE(those who got it after the 28th), disgusts me.<P>So please answer me, how are the people who got it late supposed to view themselves? If not unlucky.<P>Aiuza Stormfyre<BR>51st Wizardess<BR>Bristlebane<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>&gt;Please, lets not look at this as people who got <BR>&gt;there later getting hurt, but perhaps as people <BR>&gt;who got there sooner getting lucky.<P>This has got to be the most disgusting response you've ever posted Abashi.<P>Thousands of people ordered the day the store went live or soon after and thousands of people failed to receive their order. Not the 10% you laughingly claim but more.<P>That's beside the point though, what *should* worry you, Verant, is that *everyone* knew this would happen. There was not a single person that plays this game who didn't know that there would be great loot on the first week which would then be taken away.<P>Kunark is an amazing feat of work, and I enjoy it. However, taking the same route as you have always taken where you reward people that were fortunate to be given the CD on time and shafting the people that didn't because of YOUR shipping FUBAR is unfair.<P>What's really sad is that the majority of us thought that the great melee items was your way of fixing the divide between melee and casting classes. It's with great sadness that I now realise that this divide is intended. We are intended to do far less damage than a summoned pet, have far less AC and HPs than a summoned pet.<P>I was hoping that the Cobalt drops in Karnor's was a way of allowing the semi-casual warrior that maybe doesn't know the planar farming crews to get equipment that would allow them to function properly on Kunark. I was hoping that there would be equipment like this for all classes.<P>It seems that it was merely a Verant ****up and that all the decent items are in the places that require planar crews to get to.<P>Joy, what a great situation Verant. You need planar armour to get the better than planar armour. Tough **** if you don't have literally hours to spend sitting in the planes farming your armour for months on end.<P>Thanks Verant.<P>Turelius Deisuare.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Shammydo and Hulk~<P>Both of you need to get a ****ing life.  Mistakes happen.  Look at any massive online game.  Despite its overwhelming success, Ultima Online had its fair share of disasters.  Many of them were so bad that players lost almost everything they had (anyone who played UO remember the countless hacks and house break-in bugs that caused players to lose almost everything they had?).  In all the time I've played EQ, I haven't seen anything that comes even remotely close.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>Give up now. Abashi is very burnt out trying to come with excuses for Verant. If you listen to his recent posts they say, yeah it sucks, we know you want it changed, but it will not be changed. He will NEVER respond to a the well thought out responses located furthur into the threads. He has given up. We need to take their punishment of the "unlucky" and enjoy it, or leave. I do think they are trying to lessen their player base for some wierd reason. Verant will lie to and cheat you, if you are not used to it by now then you are in a cloud.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>It all boils down to this.  Kurnak was not beta tested well enough.  I'm glad it's out, and I'm glad I have it now.  I'm also sorry I didn't get it on opening day to get some nice items like the other people did.  In any event the beta testing of ROK was a joke.  It was made up of personal invites from Verant and hadn't given nearly the stress test that ROK needed like Beta IV did.  You should have opened it for one week to beta testers of X number who signed up, and all of these problems would have been solved before release.  Lesson learned I hope.  Next time an expansion comes out for EQ, I think i'll make multiple orders on the first and second days and then simply cancel the extra orders after getting mine on release day.  ;P  Or maybe I'll ebay off the extras to people who can't get their upgrades from the online stores.<P>Bottom line, if RoK was beta tested better, this wouldn't have happened.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>The loot could have been turned down a bit but it has been turned virtually off.<P>Look at the history of the game. Let's start with manastones, jboots, and the box of abu-kar. Those that raced up in levels or bought the game early after release didn't have much of a problem with the drops being gone here, in fact many gloated. I remember one guy that bought the box off a newbie when the goblins would drop it (definately a bug IMHO) and they didn't realize the value of it.<P>Then there was the fiasco around the Plane of Fear when it opened. These same players rushed in their level one twinks to loot armor for about a week while the masses were still leveling up at about the rate Verant designed the game to be. Then Verant decided Fear was too easy and nerfed the drops, capped the zone (some level 35 tanks were actually contributing to parties in there btw), and increased the difficulty of the zone. Then much the same happened in Hate and with the dragons. But the elitest didn't care (at least most didn't) because they had their dragon loot and their planar gear while the masses were beginning to reach the upper levels.<P>Now the average and casual gamers saw that finally the might actually have a chance at getting something past the quest armor and lower guk drops as upgrade. Many rushed to Kunark and I feel happy for them, at least they got a small penance for spending 40+ days of gaming and not having the time to go on 12+ hour planar raids. But somehow this screwed the elitist, I really don't see how though since the casual amd average gamer will NEVER have a full set of planar gear and dragon items.  But yes somehow 20 ac more out of a few items or a really good high level weapon somehow made the true elitest mad, very mad. Some didn't feel that way however, even though they got their full set of uber gear. They looked at Dragon and Planar raids as being about a challenge not about loot, it was just secondary to many of them. The economy is and has been screwed so that arguement about Kunark was bunk to begin with. Why should a player that has been level 50 for months care about the plat resale value of Kunark items? How much plat do they really need when most can get 1000's fairly fast and probably have 1000's already? Think about that one a minute. <P>But EQ isn't that different from any other online game, those that race ASAP will be rewarded for their efforts, those that fit the majority will suffer because of it. Some of those that race to the top will welcome with open arms those with typical gamer's hours as they level up as earning a right of passage. Others will only scowl and stick within their close circle of friends and note that the level 50 in the group just leveled to 50 and hasn't "paid their dues", to them they never will. One group welcomes any new loot and congrats any casual player that was lucky enough to get said loot before the others scream about it, as if it makes them any less than what they already are. <P>What is typical and understandable is that these two factions of long term high level players have more "voting power" to the game designers. They are afterall the first ones typically to new the newest things and many I am sure were hardcore Beta players and have closer ties to the programmers than most ever will. I am sure the programmers watch closely these players to see how well their game works and ask for feedback. And it is not suprising that when one of these groups screams "NERF IT!", they will listen much more to them than the masses. Afterall the loudest and strongest bird in the nest gets fed first.<P>I have no problem with either group nor any high level player that has been level 50 months ago, they are just a cross section of people and any group is the same. I just find it very unfortunate that the casual and typical player will probably never fully flesh out their characters no matter how much time the spend playing, such is this game. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">

</FONT><HR>imaginos9~<P> It sickens me to think that any Verant employee might waste their time reading a post like the one you made.<BR> <BR> EQ is, and always has been subject to change.  The only people who are bothing to ***** and moan are the greedy schmucks who feel they have somehow had their life ruined because they coulnd't set foot on Kunark the day the expansion went live.<P> Now think about this for a moment.  Yes, some people lucked out and got some nice items that shouldn't have been there, or shouldn't have dropped as often as they did.  However, some of the first explorers on Kunark paid a heavy price by *destroying* their faction with the towns there and not even knowing it.  One of the necromancers in my guild (a dark elf) is now KoS in Overthere because he hunted in Karnor's Castle, not realizing the faction he was killing belonged to that town.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037731-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/037731.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=037731&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards-cgi.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=037731&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
