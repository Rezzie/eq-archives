</FONT><HR>"As I said, that is not the same type of change that we are discussing here. Surely you recognize the difference."<P>It still makes a difference in gameplay.  Would I love my druid to be able to see the world around him?  Of course, but I have to really on other senses until 35.  Are those footsteps coming towards me?  Same with my little cleric and necro.<P>Plain and simple...this is asking for a change in the way the game is played.  It would make it easier for those below 35 to keep track of the world around them and thus eliminate some danger...and for good solo classes, would help out quite a bit.<P>To say it's boring is an opinion.  It's boring to you, doesn't matter to me.  Since I play in small groups, I have to pay a lot more attention to the sounds around me when my puller is out so I don't get aggroed by a passing mob.<P>Stirek 51 Mystic<BR>Inny Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"Vlad, you play a druid and a necro. Two outside solo classes. Perhaps it makes a (tiny) bit of difference in the gameplay for them to have to get up and look once in a while to see if something has wandered by."<P>Aye, correct. However this is still a valid method of play for some classes.<P>So, in a matter of two pages, I'm told that my opinions are invalid, first because I play a Paladin and Ranger (and not a caster), then that I play a druid and necro (a caster, but not the RIGHT kind of caster, apparently).<P>OK, what bout my wizard, enchanter, shaman, or cleric?<P>I still have to sit and meditate as these, and stare at the book, while in a group, even. I live with it. I doubt it's my lack of mental fortitude that keeps me from quitting; I just don't find staring at the book all that terrible. Perhaps it's because I focus my attention on the truly dynamic aspect of the game: the chat window. I'm not missing any great graphical interludes by looking at the book. <P>Once you've seen a group whacking away at a gnoll, you've seen pretty much everything. *What the group is whacking on* changes from zone to zone; however fighting a goblin, a gnoll, an orc, a bulthar, a gorgon, or an ashenbone drake all look remarkably the same. Is it this interaction, this visual reference to the game that keeps your interest? I mean, when the 502nd orc of the evening has been pulled to the group, there isn't much to hold interest, IMHO.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>No taboo subjets really.  As for knowing which they don't wish to discuss?  It depends how long you've been around the boards reading either Abashi's and now Absor's posts.<P>Gordon from July 2000<P>Meditation<BR>Originally the idea was, from a roleplay perspective, that meditiation should take some concentration, which is why the spell book covered the screen to begin with. You weren't even able to talk while medding in the beginning. Later, we decided to remove the requirement to look at the spellbook upon reaching level 35. <BR>As it is now, the plans are for it to remain an advantage of reaching the higher levels.<P>I think that's the last time there was a large thread on this issue anyway.  Now do they mind the players discussing them?  Guess not, since the thread is still open.  And there is always the chance that Absor will one day respond to it.  Possibly...some day....it's already snowed once down below  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>Stirek 51 Mystic<BR>Inny Server<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Jakanden said "You must close your mind to all other destractions and focus on your meditating." <P>That is actually a really bad example, because the first thing I do when I start 'meditating' is start 'looking' around to see who is in zone that I might group with or start chatting with my group. <P>That's hardly 'focusing'. <P>When I meditate in real life, my eyes are probably not shut. Instead, I am focusing on something(candle, blade of grass, whatever) in my environment. <P>What I don't do is talk on the phone or see who's playing in the park. <P>In game, forcing casters to sit would be fine, and 'realistic'. Forcing us to close our eyes, in effect, really doesn't.  <P>To the original poster, however, there are a lot more things in this game that need work more desperately. <P>For example, there are quests that have been broken for all 14 months I've been playing. There are _rarely_ dynamic events, and I have never heard of one that involved much more than the EQ equivalent of a Quake Fragfest wherein the GMs have BFGs and all PCs have a metal pipe, some nails, duct tape and a few kitchen cleaning supplies. Tradeskills blow. Sure, I've been a tailor and a smith and my wife has a jeweler, but there is so much that is poorly thought out, poorly implemented, and very bugged that you have to be a real masochist to stick with it. <P>I love EQ. It's a fun game. It's very pretty. The memetics Verant has put in are better than almost anything out there and would give Pavlov palpitations.  <P>The focus of a large percentage of continuing development on a small segment of the player community, however, has truly ended any chance EQ had of being an RPG. Using the message boards as an integral, interactive part of the development process was an enormous faux pas. At the very least, it rewarded whomever whined the most. <P>Having done a good bit of research on the games coming out in the next 3 months, I anticipate a large exodus of those of us that are tired of playing a game held hostage by l33t wh1n3r5. <P>Anyway, DOWN WITH SPELLBOOKS! <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>mal, its called a debate of issues, some people like that the book is there and they are going to say so.  You saying that they cant or shouldnt is rather childish of you.  It isnt like he is coming in here and just saying wahh, or whine or whatever, he is posing his reasons why he doesnt feel it should be changed.  Thats the idea.<P>As for the book, I dont think it should remain as long as it does, and here is why.  I play 4 chars and three of them are casters and all of em have to look at that darn book (bard, enchanter, cleric, druid).  There are a number of reasons to remove the book.<P>1.  It really isnt fair to the offensive type casters, I play a druid & a chanter, and they have much greater problems with the book then my cleric, because most of what my cleric needs to worry about is available from book mode.  The enchanter needs to know about adds, where they are, how close those mobs are when he is mezzing, so he ends up standing a much greater percentage of the time then my cleric.<P>2.  It is really bad for multiple screen resolutions, I have a pretty good machine so I play the game in a larger then 640x480 screen view, problem is every time I meditate, I have to shrink to a screen where that book only fills 30% of the screen.  My text becomes mere dots on the page and sometimes it takes a second to make the switch from full screen mode to the book.  This causes unnessessary hardship on the machine and causes more frame rate degredation.  Nothing worse then losing a party member because the time to switch from book to full screen took an extra second or two.<P>3.  Lack of the lag meter, I often find out I have gone LD when my buttons simply wont respond, I cant see that nothing is going on and so it takes forever to get it to respond.  This causes unneeded downtime because when I see that I have gone LD I can /q and my computer will respond to the LD quicker then if I dont /q.  This means a longer time getting back into the game and possibly losing a spot in my group.  Plus it is just overall frustrating to have everything "lock up" on you for no apparent reason.  I dont even know I am lagging sometimes so I dont warn my group which can cause problems.<P>4.  I have a good machine and a good sound card, however the sound in this game does not work very well for me, the sound is often hollow and I here things sporadically, so while someone with a better configuration for your game can hear something sneaking up on them, I am caught at complete unawares for no good reason.  So just because my sound card doesnt play well with your game, I am at a disadvantage to others, and that is not fair either.<P>All in all, the book is really anti what this game should be about, and that is interacting with the game world around you.  And that should include both the visual stimulation as well as the text of and communication aspects.  If you dont remove the  medding spellbook entirely then perhaps consider moving it up to 20 or 25 where you can sit and med.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>"Thats bull Stirek... because here is something thats positive influence on the game and has no ill effects whatsoever on you.. I am wondering if you really can be this selfish ? Is it possible?"<P>Not selfish at all.  Think of your argument.  Melee binding would be another positive influence on the game.  Clarity at level one would add "more fun" to the game.  Your mana would regen to full in the low levels almost as fast as you could cast.<P>Letting my monk bind himself anywhere would add a lot "more fun" to the game by not having to cross a lot of zones on a CR.<P>Not losing exp upon death would add a lot "more fun" to the game.  No more worrying about dying.<P>Placing teleport portals for anyone to use would make the game less tedious, and thus "more fun" to those classes that can't port.<P>Letting my lvl 30 druid meditate without the spellbook would remove an element of danger by seeing a mob coming near him.

</FONT><HR>I agree with 2 and 3, but they might be able to have the lag meter overlay the book for that reason.  I also hate the screen swithcing.  I had also posted that this morning.  So far, it is the only valid reason I can see for ditching the spellbook pre-35.  But that's more of a technical issue than a gameplay issue.<P>As for #1, I don't really think it's all that important in the lower level game to be staring at the spellbook through an entire fight, like it is from 35 and upwards.  One doesn't need to med an entire fight pre-35, so one can see the adds.<P>I somewhat agree with #4.  When I changed soundcards, I never knew what the game sounded like.  It made quite a difference.  And has also made soloing a bit easier since I can now "hear" what's around.  But again, that's more a technical issue than a gameplay issue.<P>Stirek 51 Mystic<BR>Inny Server<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>stirek, fine if those are "just" technical issues, then I will be fine with them removing those technical issues and leaving the book, problem is I doubt they have the ability to change the technical issues, and they can obviously remove the book.  I dont think screans locking up and the screen resolution are minor issues either.  The game looks vastly better on higher resolutions, but because of the stupid meditate not working in full screen many people dont go to those higher resolutions and therefore lose out on the enjoyment of the game.

</FONT><HR>Mr. Stirek,<P>You have been very polite to all of us, and I appreciate it.  I will try to return the favor.<P>You said: "One reason? Because I haven't seen anyone make a compelling argument to ditch the spell book yet."<P>Here is the compelling reason.  It is tedious.  The marginal value that is gained in making gameplay more challenging is overwhelmingly outweighed by the huge loss in enjoyment in playing the game.<P>You said: "The 'what's it to you?' is the same thing that could be said in a lot of threads. What's it to you if melees are able to bind? What's it to you if clarity gets moved to lvl 1? After all, it's not hurting you."<P>Answer:  Each of those changes would have a major effect on game strategy and class balance.  Incontrast, this change would have a remarkably small effect on game strategy and class balance, but it would improve the fun of the game for many of us.<P>You said that at under level 35, there is very little medding during battle.  Not if you are a cleric there isn't.  A good cleric in a balanced group meds during every battle.<P>I beleive that you are sincere in your viewpoint, but I ask you to try to reconsider it afresh.  We are not asking for the moon here.  We are asking to have the game not be made more boring than necessary.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Unfortunately, from a gameplay perspective, that's not a reason to remove the book.  You don't have to play in the higher resolutions, that's a personnel choice you make when you play.  While I think VI should correct it, I won't hold my breath.  IMO, that's a more important issue than the spellbook til 35 anyway, especially since that could apply all the way down to when a caster gets the skill.<P>You might as well remove certain textures from the game that make the chat box hard to see.<P>From a pure gameplay standpoint, there's no reason to lose the spellbook before 35.  From a technical standpoint?

</FONT><HR>I disagree that there are no gameplay reasons, I think the enjoyment of the game is decreased by the "spell book" and I think that the difference in what the classes do makes a big difference, a wizard for example stands throughout most of the fight to help with his battle management, but a cleric for example would med the entire time during the fight unless he is casting a heal.  Your statement that medding during the fight is not needed before 35 is complete and utterly false.<P>There are mostly technical reasons why this should be changed, and I dont think that screen resoloutions is a minor one because I can "choose" my resolution.

</FONT><HR>"It is tedious. The marginal value that is gained in making gameplay more challenging is overwhelmingly outweighed by the huge loss in enjoyment in playing the game."<P>While tedious, meditating with the spellbook has certain risks associated with it.  It would affect gameplay.  The danger of meditating in certain zones would be minimal.<P>"Each of those changes would have a major effect on game strategy and class balance. Incontrast, this change would have a remarkably small effect on game strategy and class balance, but it would improve the fun of the game for many of us."<P>Unfortunately, that is an argument that can be used in the issues I gave examples of.  It's quite obvious many people enjoy the game, even with the spell book.  There wouldn't be 300,000 subscribers otherwise.<P>"You said that at under level 35, there is very little medding during battle. Not if you are a cleric there isn't. A good cleric in a balanced group meds during every battle."<P>I said there wasn't a reason to.  Not even for clerics.  If you have sufficient mana for a fight, you don't need to med.  If your point is to enjoy the game, then you would need to put up with the downtime associated with having actually played during the fight than sit and med.<P>Again, enjoyment of the game is brought up.  Let melees bind themselves, I hate having to zone into a city to bind a player, takes away my enjoyment of the game.  Yet I will always do it, I just ask that they check inside the city first.  When on one of my melee characters, I have seen players ask for binds for over an hour at times.  Don't you think that takes away their enjoyment of the game?<P>Tedious or not, it's there for a reason.  One doesn't have to like it, just have to get to the level where it's no longer required.  Advancement in skill is part of the game.  Otherwise, why not give everyone the skills at level 1?<P>Stirek 51 Mystic<BR>Inny Server<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>"Your statement that medding during the fight is not needed before 35 is complete and utterly false."<P>Now there's a false statement if I ever saw one.  I play with a lvl 25 cleric at times (when he's not playing his ranger).  He never meds during the battle (he has that melee mentality).  When I play my level 30 druid with my friends monk, I only med during battle because "I" want to.  He has plenty of times stated that I can stand up and whack the critter.  It's all in how much downtime you want.<P>I play this game for the enjoyment of it, I put up with downtime, I put up with having to get my wife log off a character she is playing and bring up one that can bind me.<P>"There are mostly technical reasons why this should be changed, and I dont think that screen resoloutions is a minor one because I can "choose" my resolution. The game is unplayable on my machine at 640x480, and it is not a "choice" I have to make, also I dont think it is a good practice to make it so that only melee characters are allowed to choose screen resoloutions."<P>/em shrugs<P>I have absolutely no problem in 640x480.  It's quite playable for me.  I hate the screen switching from the higher modes.  And as I said, that is something VI should fix.  It is not a reason to ditch the spellbook.<P>Stirek 51 Mystic<BR>Inny Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Stirek, you can't possibly argue that removing the need to stare at a spellbook is as significant as giving players SoW or clarity as a level 1 spell. Not without grossly overstating the benefits of being able to see.  Spellcasters can already hear and speak and see whatever goes on in the chat window while meditating.  Since the addition of such spell messages as "your root spell has worn off" being able to see is not as much of an advantage for soloers as it would have been in times past.<P>This is a change that has an extremely small impact in terms of gameplay and a HUGE impact in terms of satisfaction.  You feel much more a participant in the group if you can see what your groupmates are doing.  You feel much more like you are playing a game.  Staring at the spellbook felt to me like putting a single player game on pause.  Like you weren't really playing anymore.  Particularly back in the days where you couldn't speak.<P>My first character after release was one I had enjoyed playing in beta: a dwarven cleric.  In release, I only got him up to about 20th level before starting a druid, another favorite from beta.  The druid is now 55 and I occasionally have tried to play the cleric.  The biggest drawback to enjoying that these days is having to stare at that bloody spellbook again.  It's a bad idea that should just go away.<P>If I was a game designer and I could make my game more fun to play with such a minimal impact to gameplay balance, hell yes I'd do it.  Particularly in the early levels where new customers might be discouraged and leave.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>stirek, do you have any arguement other then disregarding the points of others?  I have seen no point come out of your posts other then to say that nothing anyone else feels is relevant.  Perhaps actually come up with a reason that it SHOULD be in the game instead of just disregarding any reason why it shouldnt.<P>I havent seen ANY reason that the spellbook should be there other then "because it was before" well I am going to ignore that arguement, so why dont you argue why the book should be there instead of belittling other peoples opinions....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058535-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058535.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058535-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058535-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058535-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058535-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/058535-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=058535&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=058535&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
