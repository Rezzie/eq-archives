</FONT><HR>More comments from my cob-webbed skull:<P><BR>Quote:<BR>Dots:Our dots put out too much taunt for so little damage and are all(cept 1) area affect and usualy result in death if played in a good fight.<P>  Disagree. DoTs are well used by solo bards. When working in groups our DoTs are awsome when combined with root-parking (ie when no enchanter is around). The DoTs are also very good when used in an AOE group. IMHO, a bard in an AOE group is a very strong link, doing good damage, healing and decreasing downtime. I've done AOE groups as the only healer with great success on several occasions. Our DoTs are currently fine, although the higher ones are a little fire dependant. As many of our lines, the gains are linear rather than exponential. This possibly needs a look at, as other classes abilities increase on an exponential curve.<P>  As somebody else mentioned, a lvl 2 AOE DoT is probably a major cause of many bards being abandoned due to incedental mob aggro or playing it near NPCs. As someone else suggested, a small (self only?) damage shield here would be nice, while moving the DoT to around 6th level.<P>Quote:<BR>I'm sorry but if you think twisting songs takes skill you must be paralyzed from the neck down.<P>  Twisting is a pretty easy skill to master, but it does have physical demands (hand cramp!). What does require skill, is twisting songs with additional BoH twist, staying within melee range (preferably at the back so as to deliver addiotional strikes and avoid ripostes) and retaining situation awareness so as to spot adds early, change to wind, mezz adds and retarget. Playing a good bard IMHO requires more skill than other classes; it's our handicap for being a (hopefully) decent class. If casters moan about us not needing mana or melees about our casting abilities, I point out that on raids I have to twist solidly for 6 plus hours (we believe in constant pulling on raids). Having played other classes, I can honestly say that in 95% of situations, the bard is the most demanding to play (My dinnner is usually cold before I can eat all of it while playing my bard). This, IMHO is why we should be a strong class.<P>Quote:<BR>27 hmm charm songs.... funny i dont look like an enchanter... hmm verant must want me to be one since now i have 2 songs that clearly cross over to the enchanter side... oh i get it im a hybrid part warr part enchanter? or is it part rogue part enchanter? im so confused maybe i should wear a dress?<BR>28 well hmm another enchater ability... ok im certain im an enchanter wannabe<P>  Please think about what a bard is. Try to think of why certain songs will be part of a bard's repitoire. In many ways a bard is an enchanter. I posted an explaination earlier of my interpretation of what a bard is. Any changes should be based upon a Vision (TM) of what the class is, rather than a random scattering of effects. A bard is a musician, traveller, free spirit and an entertainer. Never seen a snake charmer or been entraced by a performance? Charms and similar effects and travel songs are the very backbone of what the bard class is.<P>Quote:<BR>29 he we go with the resist buffs again... doesnt verant know by now we dont use these<P>I disagree strongly here. Pleeease keep resist buffs! They're a damned good series. I usually have at least one resist buff memmed to twist in whenever a caster is pulled. Adding a frost resist into twist patterns when GIBs are pulled for example is a logical use of resist buffs. If you're not doing it, then you're missing a major tactic. Furthermore, our resist line gives us a lovely niche in raid situations. Everyone wants a bard in the party on dragon raids or on the Maestro and this is one of the very rare situations where the bard becomes a temporary core class.<BR> <BR>Mana song:<BR>Making it last 3 pulses would indeed be nice. I can understand why this was not originally done (to try to make us think about playing other tunes in combat), but now we have the catana for down-time, making this a 3-pulse song would increase it's use again. That being said, there are a lot more efficient songs to be playing in combat than this. During combat most casters are on their feet a lot and not getting the benifit much anyway. My rule of thumb is that if I see the casters are spending more time sitting than standing and there are two or less pure casters in the group, then I only play this song during downtime. Again, give us an icon pleeeeease =).<P>Another idea... This is a bit off the wall, but a small mana-required buff of some sort would be nice. 10 point str and dex or similar, or a 5-10% non-stacking haste, available at level 30ish. The only reason that I ask for this is that it would be nice to be able to buff 'newbie' characters en passant. All the other casting classes can buff in some minor way and often do so for free, which helps community spirit. I often feel a bit bad that I can travel at mach 2, yet can't bestow any non-party magical gift upon those around me who have helped me or just been friendly (short of hard cash or items, which is rather positive reinforcement of begging). By way of legitimisation, I would see such a 'spell' as the gift of a few insperational words upon a young warrior who has just exchanged a friendly greeting with you before he strikes off into the wilderness; words that fill his heart with courage and dreams of glory (hey; good name...call it Siranui's Dreams of Glory! =P)<P>Good hunting all. Off to try to get my sorry corpse out of the middle of Kael - they didn't appreciate my joke about the Giant Warlord's daughter;<P>Siranui<BR>&lt;Tides of Destiny&gt;<BR>Torv<BR>forteymj@hotmail.com<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok let me tell all these bards living a half mile from the EQ-servers twisting 4 songs something:<BR>Just connect a moderate computer on the other side of the World to the internet and then show me how u twist 4 songs with a dial up connection and being not 12 years old (sorry but everyone gets older maybe Verant thinks a bit of those who are handicapped (ex:dang I ve just one hand now I will discriminated by Verant because on the requirements on the box there was no: you need 2 hands, good memory and painkillers) or get bad aches in the fingers/hand... after 1 hour effective playing.<P>So do something about twisting I read a indeed good idea about being able to play 3 songs all time allowing it to have more time for making a choice which song suits the situation best.<BR>Even the Idea about songs of the same type stacking could be implemented with that just fill all possible slots with the same song and u get the songs efficiency increased by 75 percent.<P>Actually I ve the feeling that many high level bards believe it would be unfair to make it easier for the upcoming generation of bards... it is easier already: no class penalty hahaha good work Verant .<P>I cant wait for the major changes to all classes after u went through all threads, hope the game will feel different and better than before and making it fun to play different styles.<P>Btw make all bard songs stackable with eachother try it on test first you will see it will improve bards a bit but way not enough.<P>thats all for the moment</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>You know what I most dislike about the so called "balancing"?  Yesterday, while in Sebilis in the morning..  We had an extremely balanced group with just one slot left open.  This slot was to remain openn so that if an enchanter came in..  we could move further down into the dungeon.<P>How can they say that classes are balanced when the absence of any one can make or break a group?  In several places at the lower lvls I could work in a pinch for an enchanter, a healer, a tank, a caster.. etc..  Now, above 50 it seems that I cannot.  I offered to play haste songs, so that the enchanter we got wuoldn't have to use mana buffing the tanks..  they preferred I instead just play the mana song as it was more useful.  I offered to mix in heal if needed... they said, "play mana song, it will allow the cleric to group heal and the druid to cast regen".  I offered to mix in ac buffers, stat buffers, etc..  The shaman said just let me buff them, and you keep my mana up.<P>So, I said ok.. and I played mana song the entire time..  taking small chunks out of the mobs with my weapons..  hoping we would pull one with a pet.. so I have a meaningful job other than playing mana...   I can kill pets without getting hurt to bad..<P>Geheimnis Spieler,<BR>Bard of the Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>I know it's a little late. But please let me say what's in my mind about bard. IMHO, I think bard is group-oriented class. <P>What bard can do should NOT be able to do anything better than ANY other classes. We should NOT be able to do better CC than enchanter, not more melee output than any melee class, not even mention about DD or DoT or Buff things. <BR> <BR>I also do not suggest to enhance bard's skill cap. I even think Verant should nerf some ability of bard. Why should I post this to my favorite class? Because bard should be unique !! Not to replace other class. Bard is the soul of group. A group without bard could be okay, based on which classes they form and what mob they against. Yet with a bard, the group should do eveything they can do BETTER. Maybe bard cannot give this group any extra ability, ex: DD or Buff or Melee. But under different songs, bard can add percentage of the effect. For example, we cannot give decent damage-shield, but we can make damage-shield better; cannot cast decent DD or DoT, but we can make damage higher or re-cast time shorter or lower resist rate; cannot give nice buff, but cannot enhance duration or strength the result.<P>It means that without some class, the effect song could be useless (for example, without wizard, we cannot make any DD spell damage). As for how to make bard be the very class to make things better. It's Verant's decision. It can be implement by making things stackable (for exam: haste) or some new songs to enhance effect. <P>Show the spirit of bard.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR><BR>Personally, I live the other side of the Pond and have a 33.6 modem...so 3 songs + BoH Niv's is my limit while keeping up situational awareness and being in the right position all the while. I don't know any bards that routinely twist 4 songs as part of their normal pattern...it's too draining, even with a fast link, as well as being difficult to do reliably. I would like the class to be balanced with the consideration of a 3-song maximum twist, not 4.<P>Quote:<BR>Even the Idea about songs of the same type stacking could be implemented with that just fill all possible slots with the same song and u get the songs efficiency increased by 75 percent.<P>I reaaaaalllly don't like this idea.

</FONT><HR>So whats the problem do we lack of brain to solve those things ?<BR>just make regen songs not stack, so u can play mana all the time and still play around with 2 other slots and get a bonus of 50 percent if u fill 2 slots with lets say Chant of Battle...<P>Its kinda senseless to ruin good ideas with nonsense or other "I dont want to be mana battery stuff", a lot of necros whine now that they have to play mana battery on 50+ raids after they soloed til level 57.<P>Btw having 3 songs all the time would allow to switch instruments much more effective. (cool if u can keep 3 songs twisted while playing around with different instruments, but I am sure not many can and some like to use a weapon too...)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I cannot understand the reason wht people want an auto twist.  I cannot understand why people complain of "Carpal Tunnel" when twisting.<P>Look, Im not gonna explain how to set up hotkeys to twist.  Its been done better Here:<BR>http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper/links.htm<BR>and here:<BR>http://www.eqsongs.com/<P>got there to learn.<P>That only tough part about twisting is deciding which songs to play.  In hotkey banks 7-10, I have different song lineups set up for different situations.  (AOE, Party buff Charm/Mez, travel).<BR>I have Have the three extra hotkey banks (I play in windowed mode, too used to it to change now) set up with the secondary melee and instruments in the general inventory slots.<P>All that is set up way before I group or start combat type stuff.<P>In battle, its usually just select target and hit my hotkey (On the Keyboard, not the mouse).<BR>Press 1, slow 4 count<BR>Press 2, slow 4 count<BR>Press 3, slow 4 count<BR>Press 1, slow 4 count<BR>etc...etc...etc...<BR>How do you get carpal tunnel out of that?<P>Now if Im using instrument only, all I do is click the instrument I need ONCE, drag it to the melee slot, and durung the slow 4 count, swap instruments.  <BR>With one hand Im typing one key ever 4-6 seconds.  oh the pain<BR>With the other, Im clicking a mouse button once every 4-6 seconds.  Ouch, my chiropracter is gonna make a million off me.<P>When does this get hard?<P>With a three instrument twist, yea, it blows, but sometimes ya gotta do it.<BR>With heavy lag, kinda tough to keep up with what song is playing.  Doesnt get physically harder, just more difficult to effectively swap instruments.  If your not using instruments, its no big deal really.<BR>When someone (caster usually) gets aggroed and the warriors arent stellar performers and you have to taunt the mob off.  You may have to quickly switch to another hotkey bank (Shift 1-0) and change songs.  Again, just a few seconds to switch and change targets, plus you have to ue the mouse or keyboard with the other hand to look around and chase the mob maybe.  But no big deal really.<P>Whats the difference between Bards twisting ith no instruments and other characters?  Lets see here.<BR>Bards:  Hotkeys 1,2,3 for songs. (maybe 4)<BR>Melee types:  Hotkeys Kick, Bash, Taunt.<BR>Caster types:  Spell hotkeys, same thing.<BR>Rogue/Monk:  Backstabe, evade or all them High speed kicks and stuff.<P>The difference is in the preperation.  3 minutes tops to get a bard hotkey banks set up.  Adjust it when you adjust your song gems, and your not hitting any more keys then anyone else in combat really.<P>Now instrument twisting, yeah, you gotta click a mouse in between hitting single keys on the keyboard.  Unless you mouse wanders, or you have to move it, you can leave it placed over the secondary melee button with the swapped instrument on the cursor, and be just fine.  <P>Yeah, it takes little while to set up and get used to, but its not that big of a deal, and certainly isnt a cause to complain.  Its part of the fun of playing a Bard, at least for me.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>OK forgive me please if I am being very vague in my comment, I know you hate that, I will try very hard to use concrete examples to point to the fact that Bards are not a balanced group class.<P>I hate to quote someone without verifying the quote, but.. I believe someone at Verant has stated that "the Bard class was designed to be a group class", and I'm guessing an above average group class.  I play a midlevel bard (42) but I am one to constantly learn about my class, and every other class in the game.  <P>Ok, I'll get to the point.  I can solo kill many mobs.  In fact, I can outkill almost any other class using charm kiting or AoE kiting (running with selos, chased by 3+ mobs, playing AoE dots). When I am grouped with a snaring class, then it gets ridiculus because I can fear the whole time, and we kill very quickly.  <P>On the other hand, when I get into a 4+ character group its a different story.  First of all, it seems many zones I go into causes my connection (two T1's at my school) to have so much packet loss that I cannot twist more than 3 songs.  I don't go into Dreadlands for instance.  That said, let us assume I can never twist more than 3 songs, that is a fair assumption?  If I do not have a slower or haster, my songs of choice would include a 30% slow and a 20% haste, and a health regeneration song.  This is a decent combination, and I feel worthy of the exp that I receive from my group's kill.<P>On the other hand, if I have a haster/slower in the group I want to play two other songs because we know that Bard hastes do not stack with other spells hastes (until our 5% lvl 50 haste).  So what would I play?  Well, fear is a possible choice, but has many drawbacks -- Pulling additional mobs, resists too much, snare breaks, etc.  How about a damage shield song?  Well, mobs double attack for close 100 at my level, so using 33% of my casting ability on a 7 point damage shield seems pretty silly.  How about our DoT's?  Not a bad choice, but when a normal fight lasts about 40 seconds, it's pretty silly to try to become a damage dealer when any other class in the game would probably outdamage me.  How about twisting in the mana song? What a bad idea, I rarely twist in my mana song during battle, it virtually does nothing to reduce the length of the fight, maybe adding 1/4 of the mana required for one nuke.  Useful in a very heavy caster group, but then again, when does that happen?  Mana regeneration song is only a downtime song, lets face it.  Maybe I would play a statistic buffic song, increasing our melee classes Strength and Dexterity, possibly causing their weapons to process more.  These types of songs seems mildly helpful, but there effects are hard to notice.  In this situation, I honestly believe that probably another random class, if traded with me in the group, would contribute more to their overall success.<P>What I am trying to say is that even though I play and LOVE playing as a Bard, I do not think we as a group class are as valuable as most, if not any other class in the game.  Was our roles designed to be a downtime reducer?  That's what is seems like to me.<P>Please bear with me for one more comment,  but this is something I feel strongly about.  I feel like my class was cheated from having decent spells because of the fact that we are so versatile.  I believe that your company knows but does not _understand_ that we cannot make use of more than 3 spells effectively at any point during the fight.  If we have an instrument in hand, and we are singing 3 songs, I would like to feel as effective to the group as the Enchanter or Shaman sitting next to me.  But I am not.  This is why I solo, and this is why I wish your company should re-examine my class to make it a better group class.<P>Please do not take away any of our soloing abilities, it is very difficult to solo as a bard sometimes, and not many do it as much as I do.  Thank you for your time.<P>Jeshuah,42<BR>Fennin Ro<P>A_GM_01 says, "My eyes hurt."<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>35th level Bard, the limit of my experience with the class.<P>Thread Subject: Balancing Bards<P>Funny: (Skip) If their heads werent so big they would be balanced just fine.<P>Issues: Group usefulness<P>Definition: If you are going to balance a class you should do so based on their effectivness in a group setting. Soloing, while viable could not be balanced between all classes.  Each class should bring some form of intrinsic value to a group setting and that value should be equal to that of any other class.<P>Example: Cleric/Paladin, both classes have value in a group. A Cleric can out heal, out reserect and out buff a Paladin in a heart beat. A Paladin can out tank, and out damage a cleric in a heart beat. A cleric in a group with a paladin negates the need for the Paladin to buff the group. It does not, however negate the need for the paladin to heal or potentially reserect. Essentially healing is something that can be dont universily without any caps except the number of HPS and the amount of mana expended.<P>Example: Paladin/Warrior, both clases have value in a group. A warrior can out tank and out damage/taunt a paladin in a heart beat. A paladin can out buff, heal and reserect a warrior in a heart beat. Both classes can utilize their tanking capacity and melee damage out put, with the Paladin being slightly less useful but effective none the less.<P>I gave the above example to define what I understood balance to be. I believe it is the users understanding that a Bard should be a group based class. A class that offers allot of versatility to a class and enhances the groups over all effectiveness. Ill hit on the issue brought up in these posts:<P>Haste: Haste has a game cap. Bard spells do not stack with other haste casters. Haste is not like HP, mana or melee damage in that once the cap has been reached it does not degrade during combat but does so based on a given time limit. <P>Suggestion: To my fellow bards, I suggest we drop this one except for at lower levels where caps are often not met(unless twinks are involved...). We would be more effective if our spells effected certain abilities such as attack and AC. This would improve the melee out put of all our group members and I dont think there are any caps to them and no specific class is focused on these two attributes.<P>Damage Output (Spells): Our songs do not compare to the damage out put of a rangers, Paladins or SKs (Hybrid-Warrior/Casters). Even with the issue of mana consumption from these other classes, we can not come close to the speed and effectivness they have in this area.<P>Suggestion: When compared to the lowest spell damage dealing classes (Hybrids) we are far out of range. We do very little damage although we can eventually wear down something by kiting them with our dots. How does this help a group? It doesnt. Should we get some sort of enhancement to our spell damage? Even a 100pt manaless dd would be a significant enhancement compared to our 20pt'er. It would still not compare to a Rangers/SK's DDs, but being manaless it would have be balanced in effect.<P><BR>Healing Output: Our songs are not as effective as the Paladin and Ranger classes. Our songs are more based on significant down time, and the issue with this is that the puller is often the person hurt the most in battle. So in oder to have a regen effect, we need to follow the puller out. Which is obviously unacceptable.<P>Suggestion: An SK can heal its self better than we could, and a Paladin can heal the group quicker than we can. The whole concept behind mid to low level groups is fast up time. Nobody has time for a slow acting limited area effect healing song. Regen is ok, but it stays on you especially if you are pulling. Healing is often twisted in especially if two bards are in a group (rare at low to mid levels, and not very effective) and has a limited effect in any given battle. The healing song also has a good effect if there are many tanks tanking damage, in my experience, low to mid levels usually have one main tank and rarely a secondary. The puller is usually beat up the most with the secondary getting healed the instant an INC is messaged. So if healing is something Bards should be doing at later levels perhaps this spell should be looked at in being effective in a group setting.<P>Damage Output (Melee): There are allot of sites that have done the math on melee out put based on double attack and dual wield. My own experience is that unless twinked, at levels 20 + Bard melee power is less than any of the hybrid classes. <P>Suggestion: Have Plate shall tank is not something that applies to Bards or high level clerics. So tanking is something we arent suppose to do... On to the subject at hand... Our melee out put is limited by a few factors, instrument requirements being one and the fact that the chance to get a double hit is very low until higher levels are reached. The damage out put even if a dual wack is made, is very low compared to the higher chance of a double attack kicking in on a high damage high delay weapon. If we Bards are not meant to be a melee class, perhaps someone should really look at why we are allowed to have armor and weapons?  To fix this issue to meet what I would like, I would give Bards a low double attack skill (100). <P>Bard Role: We do not match any class or come close to any class in their various abilities. We have a wide range of songs, which are essentially the same as a 20+ level lower character. I dont know if anyone in the planes every wants the assistance of a 24th level class, but I would guess they wouldnt. Our charm songs are exceptionally powerful, in an out door invironment, and given that the casters dont mind missing out on the mana song. Our charm songs are just as powerful as the enchanters/druids/necros/shaman spells, with the limitation of duration. Yet all of the other things that you look for in group effectivness: Hasting/Healing/Damage Dealing/Tanking we are exceptionally weak in. I left one thing out, buffing and I did so on purpose. In the planes and in very unique instances the resist songs play a significant role from what I am hearing from high level players. At the low level and mid levels up to 35, they do not play any significant role in my Bards career. So even our buffs do not compare to those given out by other classes at least up to 35.<P>Comments on Previous Posts:<P>Nadira: Focus on post 50 high level bard effectivness. I agree whith most of what was posted although I have no experience post 50.  Good post and worth reading.<P>Foon: Twisting with macros. It can be done but missed notes are not taken in to account. It is a good option, but it does not apply to swapping instruments.<P>Siranvi: Crowd control- pre 27 my career as a bard had nothing to do with crowd control. All of my CC songs were resisted with my Bards un-tweeked 88 cha. Post 27, I began to use charm to keep critters off of certain memebers in a group or to add to the damage in combat. Again not much of a CC person, pixie strike changed that at 28 though.<P>Bards are a Support role: I have no objection to this concept. Clerics are a support role as well, which would you rather have go to the planes with you? Dont get me wrong, ID love to see Bards play a bigger role in this area, I just dont see it happening with what we have right now.<P>Haste Stacking: I agree, I think we should focus on things that will have a more noticable effect. Our haste songs are weak, and are only good at lower levels or when a chanter/shaman arent around.<P>Autotwisting: I understand your stance on this. I only disgree because of those people with slower connections. Its not fair that what class you can play is limited by your connection speed.<P>Desbarolis - Soloing is hard, you are coorect. I have several friends who play bards and cant solo worth beans. I have no problem with it, but that doesnt mean squat in the big picture of things.<P>Kenross - Bards are not Hybrids, well said. Other classes are better than us, at almost any area that we have, except perhaps charming. To balance the bard class is going to take some major consideration. We may not be able to dd as good as a ranger/Paladin/SK, or heal as good, but we should be comparable in some aspect.<P>TimGoesSplat: Other classes have limitations on the level mob they can charm. In fact all charming classes do, druids, shaman, enchanters, necromancers.<P>Arrow-Hart - I dont have any ss, but I would agree with you that the effects are pretty silly. Someone said that enduring breath was a good one, personally the enduring breath song we get lasts longer than 15 secs and wouldnt really be hard to twist in... Perhaps for comfort sake the effect is nice to have in Kedge, but I couldnt imagine that it applies any where else. <P>Geheimnis - The absence of an enchanter from a group and that group not being able to do certain things does not mean that enchanters are unbalanced. Granted most of the high level critters and exp are in dungeon settings and enchanters are suddenly much more desired than they once were. But before that they were only desired for their mana and haste spells. Chanters have a place and have more of an obvious benefit in many situations, unlike bards. I believe that is a fair statement.<P>RainBean - Bards are definatly not as group oriented as they would appear. The invis song while mana-less has a short range as does enduring breath, selos and levitate. Our haste songs dont stack, our attribute enchancing songs do very little, we cant heal or spell damage our way out of a paper bag unless given a good hour to do so. Bards are not unique, neither are Rangers/Paladins/or SKs. But Bards are not strong in any given area, where other hybrids are equally yoked, Bards are far away from that equation.<P>I did not mean to attack anyone in this post, I merely gave my opinion which at times confilicted with that of the author.<P>UNDER_DOG<BR>35th Level Bard - War Cry: RUN AWAY RUN AWAY!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Here is a reasonable solution to the Enchanter / Shaman / Bard conflicts.<P>1) If our haste songs all stacked with Enchanter's and Shaman's everyone would easily reach their haste cap.  Verant probably won't go for this.  Fair compromise - Make Anthem de Arms the only haste of ours that stacks.  10% haste + strength increase.  The other haste songs are reserved for when we don't have an Enchanter or Shammy in the group.  That's a start......<P>2)  If our slow songs stacked, a mob's attacks would be slowed too much to still be balanced.  Fair compromise - Add a slow song that starts at 10% and going to 18% at higher levels that stacks with everything.  Maybe give it an AC debuff that scales with your level.  Put it in around level 25. This supplements the incredible Enchanter / Shammy slow's without going "over the top".<P>3)  Fix the Mez/Lull songs.  They are resisted far too much.  If it's seen as overpowering then change the duration on mez to 2 tics.  This would allow the Bard to help with crowd control yet with occasional resists still in no way replace an Enchanter.<P>4)  Up the amount of mana stolen with Denon's Dissention, etc.  Either the group will be dead or the mob will before this takes enough mana from it to make a difference.  When I play my level 50 cleric I will kick a Bard out of the group if he twists this song instead of one that actually helps the group.<P><BR>These changes would go a long way to helping us when grouping. On raids there are always Enchanter's and Shaman's but it's not like there is one of each in every group.  Bards can be incredibly helpful with our existing songs.  We mainly need just need a couple to stack when we DO get one in our group =)<P>Being reduced to the same couple songs most of the time doesn't seem to me like it's necessarily bad.  My cleric has SoW, Resolution, Celestial Healing, Superior Healing, Complete Healing, Stun, Holy Might and Divine Aura on his spell gems all the time.  They only change to do a Rez or rebuff Symbol.  Aren't most casters this way?  We might make small changes to what's memmed depending on other classes (i.e. change stuns to DD) but I see people complaining about doing the same songs all the time.  Think about it.......  That's kinda the way the game works.<P>Not that there aren't other issues already covered a zillion times in this post.  I just wanted to give a couple specific examples of what could be done.<P>Thank you for looking into our concerns with our class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
</FONT><HR>Twisting, auto-twisting, macros, etc...<P>Couple of observations here:<P>First off, it is patently obvious that bard twisting was an early oversight, exploited early early in beta, then determined to be a "feature" and taken into consideration in subsequent changes, to a certain degree. What this means, is that the basic framework of the game, i.e. interface, client software, etc., was not designed to support it. Songs appear to use the same routines as spells, with certain zero'd costs, like mana, and incredibly short effect lengths. In other words, the mechanics of the game itself were designed to allow spell routines to be used to simulate a song, but the overlap required to ensure that the song would stay in effect allowed "twisting".<P>Now... to time travel back, once the decision was made that bards could have the effects of more than one song active on their party through "twisting", further decisions about song effects and such were colored by the fact that bards now had 2 or more songs active, when they were originally conceived to have only one.<P>This means that all "balancing" from that point on, assumed that every bard would have multiple songs going all the time... They couldn't assume less, because you have to "balance" from the MOST effective (numerically) way to play a character, because someone is going to manage it.<P>I point out these patently obvious facts to explain why twisting is absolutely necessary, and no longer optional, at least not if you wish to play your class at the degree of effectiveness which the game is designed for.<P>So... if twisting is a requirement.. then let's look at the mechanics of it.<P>The pride some people seem to have for their twisting "ability" really does crack me up. I mean.... seriously... that's like bragging to the world that you can handle the fourth turn on a Simon game... ("...and then I pressed red, red, blue, yellow! It was soooooo hard!)<P>Anyone can "twist". It's not an amazing skill. Learning the songs that don't stack with one another is more difficult... but not much more.<P>Twisting is not "hard", it's tedious... it's dull... and it prevents things like... oh... talking.  Ever try to explain to someone who is insistently "telling" you during the middle of an iffy "kite" combat? I use macros with prepared speeches about what I'm doing. Unfortunately reply doesn't macro, it seems.<P>Using macros to twist is fine... but has flexibility problems. I have a couple but rarely use them, since I constantly juggle different songs depending on what is needed. To illustrate, I commonly use a horn and play chain (initially for the slow component), discord, and anthem... unless casters are having trouble, then I'll switch up anthem with Fulfils to get a little MR reduction... or if no one is hitting it, Pixie Strike. Sometimes I'll even switch to a lute and play heal, chains, and anthem, to give a few extra hits to a faltering group. This doesn't even look at how I need to change up for unexpected adds to a combat...  Or how I will learn different songs for different locations... or how I mentally rank every song in every combination and will retry a failed one if I consider it more crucial, dropping out a round of one of the others...<P>All in all, macroing every combination is way too troublesome for my style of play... I can just see getting lost trying to recall whether the combo I need is in song-macro-hotkeypad 5 or 6.<P>On the other hand, I wouldn't mind having the ability to talk to people during combat... or even, *gasp*, while levitate/running with a party.<P>All that said... I don't think it's possible for an auto-twist to be implemented into the game. Besides changes to the client interface to handle such a thing, changes to the entire spell-casting system which might cause new glitches for other classes, there are the difficulties of recreating the problems we currently face (dropped songs on restarts, sequential resists as we cycle through, etc etc).<P>In the fantastic world of wish-fullfilment, I'd personally love to see a new interface for bards-only, where each "song" was considered a verse... the bard would chose "verses" to form a song, and start singing/playing. The higher the level, the more verses you could have in your "song".<P>As it stands... I'm not sure the issue can even really be addressed, and maybe we shouldn't cloud the "balance" issues with it?<P>--------------------<BR>Hmmm... I seem to have illustrated the concept of "irony" with a long post on a subject that ends up concluding that we shouldn't waste time talking about that subject here.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I agree with Sapper about no auto-twisting, but let me take it a step further, as to what the REAL problem is.<P>The real problem is people who insist on using a bad keyboard setup.  Those people are causing all the problems themselves.  Being a Bard takes skill, and if you don't set your keyboard up correctly, you suffer at your own hands, all pun intended.<P>Carpal from twisting is NOT a balance issue, it's a you're too stubborn to see you're hurting yourself issue. Rather than take some time to come up with a more comfortable keyboard setup, you'd rather suffer and complain.  Here is the optimum keyboard setup for playing a Bard, in mine and many other people's opinions.<P>A = Turn Left<BR>W = Walk Forward<BR>D = Turn Right<BR>S = Walk Backwards<BR>X = Crouch<BR>E = Nearest Enemy<BR>1-0 above the letters = hotkeys 1-10.<P>With that keyboard setup, your left hand never moves.  You have access to almost every single command in the game within a few millimeters of eachother.<P>C for con, R for reply, T for tell, the shift and alt keys are right there as well.<P>Your right hand stays on the mouse, except when you are typing.  The combination of the right mouse button and A or D strafes.<P>All you LIARS, yes LIARS, that say you are getting carpal from pressing the keys every so often are LYING.  You have carpal because you use a poor keyboard setup.  Do you know why typists use the home keys?  One reason is that it reduces strain.  There are typists who can type for many many years at 120 words per minute (in one hour I bet they have pressed more keys than you have in an average EQ session) without any pain or discomfort.  Oh, but they're just lucky, right?<P>Nope, you're just too lazy to play a Bard. Monks have to press the combat keys a lot, but I don't hear them complaining about carpal, or how they want to have all their attacks put into one easy keypress.<P>This whole auto-twist thing should NEVER be implemented. Learn how to play a Bard, or don't play a Bard.  The Bard is one of the hardest classes in the game to play.  If you're not up to the challenge, which includes optimizing your keyboard layout, then don't complain that it's Verant's fault that you can't compete with the people who can play a Bard.  <P>Your need does not justify dumbing down the character.  If they did that, any undextrous walfwit could play a Bard, and that would be a disservice to the entire EQ community.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>back, my sis needed to check something and booted me off. well about the trade skill  the blacksmithing community would benifet from it and we could make the dyed fine plate more profitable by making it when you combine certain gems into certain dyed fine plate ited result in better or worse chrarisma and maybe a little extra boost to stats example would be yellow dyed armor wouldnt go well with a blue gem IMHO  making the chrarisma take a drop but put a pearl or opal in there id think that would raise it or neutralize the drop this is also IMHO. and these things would be made wearable by all however bards could implant 4 diferent jewelery crafted items into this making the stats jump a bit more keeping in mind it has to be enchanted but they canot put more than 2 of the same type of gem made item to limit those who like to power overload stats personaly im going to hit my armor up with a blackened sapphire item diamond item star ruby item and a emerald item if this idea is implemented. think this is unfair anybody gime a varyation youd like by email at www.psychopainter@hotmail.com and as for weapons enchanters druids shamans wizards and clerics will come into play meening more comunnity profit posible asuming theyll charge you for it. because these get to imbue gems and an idea is these are bard only by taking imbued gems and using forged weapons (more profit to the comunity here)and making items as such an imbued diamond encrusted enchanted antonian long sword by making this you proly will think ited just be flashy IF YOU DO YOUR WAY WRONG I ADMIT THIS WILL GIVE THOSE BARDS THAT WANT THAT UNIQUE LOOK WHAT THEY WANT BUT THERES MORE EXAMPLE: ENCHANTED ANTONIAN LONG SWORD DAMAGE 12 DELAY 28 MAGIC WELL HAVE A BARD CHONCORDANCE CRAFT IT AND YOU HAVE YOUR SELF A DEITY SWORD THAT DEPENDING ON THE DEITY JEWEL MAY PROC SAY A TOPAZ FOR QUELLELIS A CHARM OR AMBER FOR RALOS ZEK A DD OR WOPPING STRENGH BUFF OR DIAMOND OF RODCET NIFE A BIG RESIST SPELL AND MAYBE (THIS APPLYS FOR ALL WEAPONS) A LITTLE MORE DAMAGE OR LESS DELAY DEITY DEPENDING OR NOT YOUR CHOICE GUYS AND ABOUT THE INSTRUMENT MAKING MAKE THAT AVAILABLE TO ALL COME ON EVERY BODY COULD MAKE INSTRUMENTS UNLESS YOU JUST DONT LIKE TO. I think this works well  i will repeat i suport the new song ideas and should my songs be made if they cost mana I BEG YOU MAKE US THOSE MANA BATTERYS AT 20 also the trade skill would be performed at the bard guilds this seems to be ideal since sacred forge is found in towns make us a crafting lodge and id like to represent the trade skills for bard if we go into represenitives however im just stating this you all get your vote.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Request for specific info:<P>I'm interested in the whole damage output debate that seems to ebb and flow in the background of these threads. However, I'm not familiar enough with other classes over 20th level to make an informed illustration of the issue.<P>As fighter classes and fighter hybrids rise in level, they hit more times and do more damage per hit. Bards seem to hit at the same rate after they get dual-wield, and do little more damage with level. What are the specifics of this phenomenon? Do the fighter classes actually increase max and/or average damage on creatures as they rise, or is it solely due to better weapons?<P>As casters rise in level they gain new more powerful spells, gain mana to their pool, and increase the rate at which they regain mana. This seems to mean that they can cast for more damage, more often, and for longer without resting. Bards cast, for the most part, three effects, from third level to 60th level. Any attack song, means one less group defensive option, one less crowd control option, or whatever.<P>So... how much damage can a bard put out, using songs and standard instruments, compared to the various casters?<P>Assuming single targets and no resists (hah!) a 30th level bard keeping a constant stream of Discord with a horn, Chords (sung), and Fulfil's chant (sung) will do:<P>Assuming that a song pulses every six seconds... giving 10 song pulses per minute.<P>Chords of Dissonance without instrument (I am assuming that no one is seriously swapping songs and instruments at the same time for any length of time...) will do 6 damage per pulse.<P>Dischord with a horn will do 24 damage per pulse.<P>Fulfil's without a drum will do 10 damage per pulse.<P>This means that a bard, playing only damage songs, at level 30 will do 40 points of damage every 6 seconds, or 400 points of damage per minute.<P>Or I suppose he could bellow for 160 damage in that amount of time, assuming every one hit for full damage.<P>At level 40... using the same songs:<P>8 + 29 + 13 = 50<P>So... 500 points per minute, using the all damage route, after 10 levels. Is that normal for other casters?<P>Let's take a look at level 50... using the same songs:<P>11 + 34 + 15 = 60<P>What a surprise... 600 pts per minute! Another ten levels, another 100 pts per minute of damage.<P>For simplicity I did not include the chant of flame, chant of frost in this, since they don't exist at the lower level. Taking them into account<BR>would add another 10 more damage per pulse at 40, and 13 more at 50.<P>This would make the progression: 400, 600, 730, which is not a friendly advancement rate.<P>Is this what other classes experience? Can someone quantify things from the other side?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<BR>First off, maybe that poster groups with a Enchanter alot?<BR>For those that do, there isn't much to do outside of regens and melee, as has been stated about 400 times in this thread. <P>Charm can be a messy way to CC anyway, as casters are bound to eventually waste time and energy nuking a charmed mob,and or healing the Bard.. actually incresing downtime and requireing more manasong.<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<P>Only messy if you don't know what your doing, and don't tell your group what your doing.  My groups always know ahead of time I'll be charming, they know to use F8 to target, they know to use /assist on the melee in the group, and they know that the only person they have to blame if they nuke my pet is themself, not me.<P>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<BR>One could make the arguement that it is you who should play a different class.. an Enchanter maybe? :P<P>Don't assume all "good" Bards play like you do.<BR>-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<P>&lt;shrug&gt; i learned from some of the best, so I'd say that your argument is false.  I am good at what I do, and I don't want it changed, because that will only help people who don't have the patience to learn to be a good bard (as well as the few who for whatever medical or mental reason are unable to play a bard ... which, in that case, they should understand already that playing a bard is out for them ... i'm sorry, but there's some things that some people just can't do.  Some people get motion sick while driving in a car, should they make first person shooters not have such quick animation to facilitate people who get motion sick easily while playing those games?)<P>Our buffs suck, and if they did stack with other caster classes that would overpower us immensely.  If they give us that, they'll nerf something else.  So either you can stand there buffing people, being just another shaman/chanter among many (with a twist), or you can actually learn to use the class to it's fullest potential.  Besides, if they nerf charm/mesmerize, and any other form of crowd control because they gave us stackable buffs (lame), there's quite a few of us who'll leave the game altogether.  Has nothing to do with trying to make a point, it's more of a 'this is how the class was defined, I understood that at the outset, I played the game through knowing what I could and would be, and then that was stripped out from underneath me.'<P>I'm not going to be forced into a single role, plain and simple.<P>-Desbarolis -- 47th bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

There is no debating that. <P><BR>I have been playing a Bard in this game since mid-beta 3..well over 3 years now, and until last May when the 39 charm song was added, Bard crowd control was limited to the low levels. <P>It is nice to have a higher level charm ability now, but it has hardly been some class defining Bardic role in this game like you want to make it out to be.<P>What you cite as a weak way to play the class (swinging weapons, singing regens and buffs) is one of the main roles of the class. always has been. In most cases that is primarily what other classes want from a Bard, like it or not.<P><BR>At the high levels, a Bards role degenerates into regen battery. Currently there is no choice in the matter. Buffing, Melee, and certainly CC fall by the wayside as the other classes get SO much better at those things than you will.<P><BR>When you get some levels behind you, and start fighting in the truely hard zones, you will find that all you have left to you is the role you seem to so hate. <BR>You will have outgrown the cap on charm, and will most likely have more Enchanters and Shaman around than you can shake a flute at, all doing the tasks that used to make you feel usefull.<P>At that point you very well may be wishing that you had fought here in -these- talks, to improve our melee, and scale our buffs to a level worthy of useing, and not wasting your time proclaiming your particular style/level of play to be the Bardic high ground.<P><BR>Aanani<BR>Paradigm<BR>Sol Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Reality check people : since we bards are such a versatile class that can do a bit of this and a bit of that, how can anyone argue that they play their bard the proper way and thus the best way?  What works for various people will not work for other people.  Currently, at level 30, I am more effective in melee combat and twisting combat songs than idling in the back swinging instruments.  Enchanter involved or not, for me it has been successful.  So am I playing my bard wrong now?<P>It would be nice to carry on a conversation during battle, but alas, the twisting can mess that function up.  So much for the aspect of social bards being social.<P>And reading these posts, if we bards are arguing among ourselves over stupid stuff like who is a better bard because "My way is the only way to play.", you think Absor and company will then give a damn about us?

</FONT><HR><BR>I think a previous writers comments about trade skills are rather out of the scope of this thread. A class-specific trade skill for bards should not be armour/weapon making. In fact, I don't really see us as justifying any class-specific trade skills. A wandering bard is simply not in one place long enough.<P>ITU:<BR>We won't be seeing this. In addition to VI's comments on giving both forms of invis to one character type (with 2 deliberate exceptions), there is no way to justify this addition. Our songs are supposed to work by confusing the opponant's mind and exploiting the fact that 'music soothes even the savage beast'. 'Historically' in fantasy Undead don't actually have that kind of mental facilty; so no ITU for us. Fortunatly VI have been generous enough to let our current lines effect undead, otherwise we'd be useless in pleanty of other situations.<P>Safe-fall wouldn't need an increase if there was a mid-level travel song with just speed & levitation. Despite us being masters of travel, we only have 3 travel songs: selos 1 & 2 and invis.<P>Again; if we deserve a niche at all (we are after all supposedly the 'master of none' character class), then it should be in the realm of faction.<P><BR>Siranui<BR>&lt;Tides of Destiny&gt;<BR>Torv<BR>forteymj@hotmail.com<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>jackfetch has a very good point there on how twisting was a consequence of accident rather than of design.  twsiting song is considered as part of the bard's function.  however, if the foundation of the bard class, meaning the bard class when first implemented, was based on a design that in the end wasn't the product, then the nature of the songs and the way they sing, stack, etc. become questionable.  the current attempt on 'fixing' the bard class would be like adding sphere onto the existing "spheres in the heavens" in order to 'fix' the stars' movement.  if that's the case, fixing the class would involve more than just adding a song (or spell, as the debate goes on) or two.<P>another issue about twisting:<BR>the game refreshes every so often to see what is being inputted, and lag affects the refresh rate.  to put it in another way, any kind of lag that affect the refresh rate, affect the game being able to take in your commands.  in my personal experience, fighting in front of the giant fort in the frontier mountain zone cause big lag because of the graphics (when the fog comes in, the situation becomes much better, which kind of tells you the graphics does affect refresh rate).  with my bard fighting while looking at the fort, i can't twist more than 2 songs, even the greying out of the spells gems takes a long time, but if i look up the sky or down to the ground while i am fighting, i will be able to twist 4 songs.  other than that fort, there are many other situations that affect the number of songs i can twist.  this is a concern becuase auto attack was originally design to fight that exact problem (imagine you having to punch in the attack key each time for your bard to swing his sword, this i believe have been addressed long ago, and twisting involves the exact same issue on lag), but singing 3 songs at once might be a problem, for example, buffs such as haste has a fix time, but charm doesn't, it's not just singing 3 songs together can solve either.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>One other though I just had<BR>On the line of Tavern Teleports. This would be a good idea, because it would eliminate wasted time sitting and waiting half an hour for a boat cause u missed it for example. I know that I find the idea of logging on for an hour to spend most of it just sitting and waiting a complete waste of time, and not what the game should be about. <BR>So this cant be abused as a evac, make it so the song can only be sung in one of the taverns. Perhaps even add a mana cost to this, if you want to limit the ability to do this. please consider this, which would greatly serve to increase game enjoyment. I know i for one would never charge others for this. And it owuld help out many people who simply cant afford to shell out the 20-30 plat for a gg. <BR>thanks for your time</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Hmm... so if a 60 wizard does 6000 damage before having to rest... how long does it take the wizard to use it up at full speed, and meditate the mana back?<P>I see a bard song at 60... unless I'm wrong about the combinations being able to do:<P>54 from a chant using a drum,<BR>19 from Dischord (no horn),<BR>and 36 from Fulfils using a drum.<P>That's a total of 109 every 6 seconds, (assuming these DOTs stack) or 1090 every minute.<P>If a Wizard can blast their mana, and meditate back in 6 minutes, then there is numerical parity. If it takes less time for the wizard, then the bards are behind.<P>Of course, numerical parity doesn't mean quite so much, since standard group dynamics are to have a as quick a fight as possible, then recover. So, although the bard has little downtime to deal with, he (or she) will not be constantly putting out damage, while everyone else is meditating.<P>Also, I don't think any bard can put out their full damage potential for any length of time, without being turned into a bloody smear on the ground by the target. So, there will almost always be some damage ability lost to a defensive ability... something that no other class really has to deal with.

</FONT><HR>Balance: The issue of Odd Songs<P>Something just struck me, and I wanted to share it. Part of the attraction to the bard class for most of us, was the sense of being "different" than everyone else. We like the fact that a lot of people have no clue as to what we can or cannot do... especially during the first half of our careers.<P>This "strange" aspect to barding is aided early on, by some of the visibly odd effects of our songs: random teleports, water breathing, invisibility (but still glowing blue balls of light), and others. Later on, however, it seems we start getting a constant stream of nearly identical songs to previous songs... with little or no silliness thrown in.<P>Perhaps it would be good to add a song or two later on, that doesn't really afford a huge advantage to the class, but offers the opportunity for downtime fun... and just plain showing off.<P>The Tavern Teleport idea is one such... although, if that seems like it is stepping on some other classes' toes, how about making it random?  Imagine a Pub Hopping song... where the bard and his group play the song, and appear in a random inn or tavern around the world... This way it wouldn't compete with the greed-meisters who fiercely defend their class rights to teleports so they can charge travel fees... but it would be semi-useful, and just plain FUN!<P>If random can't work, then how about a standard route through a series of bars, so that bard groups would have to hop along from stop to stop?<P>If a teleport is out of the question... then how about an AE memory erase song, which causes the creatures affected to spin around in circles? It could be the Dance of Madness, or something...<P>Players can use shrink or enlarge spells, why not an AE shrink or enlarge song... it doesn't even have to have any significant statistical effect to be fun. Although, if it doesn't have an effect, it would be most amusing if it was not considered an aggressive song. (Imagine giant guards after a bard passes through town... )<P>-----------------------<P>One last thing... consider putting a really useful different song into the post-50 game. Right now the general clamor is for more melee at those levels since nothing else seems to be of value. If adding more melee is anti-Vision, then how about something totally NEW.<P>Something like a song of Hate, single-target, that makes the creature inimical to every other creature that can see it, as long as the song is sung. This sort of thing could even function as a rough crowd control, used to occupy a camp so that creatures can be pulled by the rest of the party.<P>------------<P>These are just some rough ideas... but I'm thinking that there might be some merit in investigating the possibility of handling some of the balance issues through a few new songs, in a creative way...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>jackfetch, forgive me for this, but that is a very uninformed opinion and COMPLETELY untrue and downright insulting to wizards in particular.<P>first off, the idea that bards should be able to match wizards in damage is sickening, the fact that the comparison can even be made is downright disgusting to any wizard who ever read that he is the "master of direct damage."  wizards currently are so underpowered damage wise it's not even funny.  for bards to come anywhere near to the amount of damage wizards do is insane because that's basically all wizards do, dd damage, bards on the other hand have much more.  for the jack of all trades master of none class to come close to equaling the masters of direct damage is insane.  next, if a high level wizard goes oom he won't even be close to full mana again in 6 minutes, maybe halfway, but that's assuming help from a chanter or bard.   <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  furthermore, this downtime which you seem to think standard groups promote in play does in fact not exist, and this is one of the major reasons wizards aren't wanted in groups.  xp wise it isn't efficient to have such a huge downtime as a wizard requires.  lastly, your comment on a bard being unable to unload their full o capabilities on a mob for fear of agro holds double for wizzies.  when a mob goes agro on you you can run, not so with wizards.  we basically die, every time.  the result is that we can't unload all of our mana quickly, which means we can't regen mana that fast because we can't even spend it that fast.  if the situation ever does arise where we need to chain dump often times we are already low or oom from repeated castings and a lack of regen.  and there's another key issue, we can't med during a battle.  for fun, try sitting down sometime during a battle, just try it.  you want some more fun, try medding, i PROMISE you will never do it again.  you've never seen a mob retarget and jump agro so fast as when a caster sits down, it's kind of ridiculous.  and once that caster gets hit and loses some hp, you can just about forget it, the group is better to admit he's gone and try damage control.<P>now, am i saying that bards don't have balance concerns, no, quite the opposite in fact.  imo the role of any caster type (which the bard is, say what you will) has become lil more than a buffer/healer now, and any damage is negligible.  hell, even chanters are being heavily resisted on mez now and are only good for buffing in alot of situations.  this more than anything else is why bards no longer seem to have any role.  fixing the magic/melee balance is the only way to right class balance.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Balance Issues:<P>  The only ones that I can see, applying are that of better melee damage and or song damage. At higher levels better melee damage is stongly desired by most of the players in that range. At the low to mid levels it appears that most of us want more powerful dd's dots or other obvious effects from our songs. To be useful beyond the mana song would probably be an accurate description.<P>JackFetch: Here is a link to some melee info<BR>http://www.gameznet.com/eq/meleeodds.html<BR>I think that the damage out put we should compare the bard with is more to that of the other hybrids. Spell wise they can out damage us, and melee wise they can out damage us.<P>Haap7: I agree with the others that a trade skill would not really address any of the issues in regards to bard balance. It would be neat of course and is a good idea. But I wouldnt see it as a balancing concept.<P>Dalakar_Daystar & Desbarolis: I perceive both of your input in this string as instrumental  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/wink.gif"> And insightful, I hope you continue to provide imput, and any direct attack against either of you are ignored by me and considered childish.<P><BR>TimGoesSplat: You raise some interesting questions, and although I could answer them from what Verant initially stated about the Bard class when the game went live, I dont think their vision holds true. I would really like to see your question as to what a Bard in the eyes of Verant so that we can all see where the class is headed. If it is truly a jack of all trades and master of none. We must question, if a level 15 rogues pick lock or disarm trap skill have any real value, not to mention songs whose power is of the same level of efficiency. Bards are obviously more than that right now... But what does the future hold? Is a rogue without backstab still a rogue? <P>Aanani: One of the reasons I play a Bard is because I can cast spells and melee. For me melee is very important but sadly lacking even at the low to mid levels. So much that an untwinked bard is more effective with instrument attacks instead of swining a few swords about. I believe your concerns are in line with all of the higher level Bards though, and I hope it is not drowned out by we mid level players.<P>Axlerose: I dont think there is a wrong way of playing. What ever is fun for you is probably the right way. I do know that as versitile as Bards are, we are given over to certain songs during battle and other songs after battle. We all have common links to these songs and there is a certain order to their use. Would it be wrong for you to not play the mana song when in an all caster group? If thats ok with you to not sing it and everyone is enjoying themselves, cool. But the norm is that casters like mana song, and it does give we bards a sense of helping out, more so than our pitiful melee skills. <P>Lordness66: Tavern TP songs, hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! IM sorry that is the funniest thing I have read in a long time. I dont think it does much to balance the class, but I could be wrong. =&gt;<P>ROCK ON BARDIC WARRIORS<BR>UNDER_DOG<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I believe that the key question facing Absor and Verant in reference to bard balance is this:<P>Does Verant want Bards to fulfill the jack-of-all-trades role?<BR>It's good for Roleplaying (OMG! Did I just say roleplaying in an Everquest context!?) and true to the classic concept of Bards in most fantasy roleplaying realms.<P>Or would Verant like to keep the game fair, for all customers and character classes and balance the Bard class to the others?<P>It would be good customer service to balance Bards, but the jack-of-all-trades concept that is the current role of Bards implicits denies the ability to balance them with pure and other hybrid classes.<BR>Because Bards are basically hybrids of enc/dru/war/rog, there is little that Verant can do to make a fair balancing act.<P>The only way that I see Bards being balanced in a manner that would be acceptable to Verant, existing Bard players, and the rest of the Everquest playerbase would be to excise the classic concept of Bards being jacks-of-all-trades and give them a role that is unavailable or unfeasible for other classes to fill.<P>As it stands, logically, Bards are just fine the way they are. They are on a more powerful platform at low levels because of their diversity of skills/roles. At higher levels, the specialists (read: pure classes) are going to leave Bards far behind in their respective roles.<P>As it stands, Bards are written for a RPG. Everquest is, unfortunately, not a roleplaying-intense game, therefore the logic keeping Bards as the jack-of-all-trades role is illogical.<P>It is my humble opinion that Bards ought to be changed to have their niche, their specialty, their _thing_ that nobody else can touch. What that should be, mana drain monsters, faction masters, etc. is beyond my scope to envision.<P>Kaleras Marrsong, Bard of the 29th Lyric<BR>Holy Herald of Mithaniel Marr<BR>Bertox Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>under_dog ive have been thinking about this and maybe your right but it wouldnt unbalance it either ited benifet all classes and its not just weapons and armor that are made i was thinking a music box that you put a bard song scroll into and make it a 10 charge item recharged by puting the scroll into it and hit combine,  and ive been drawing up recipes for these things come one we are bascially rouge chanter ranger and a tiny bit shamen 2 of those have class only skills and chanters are realy the the only ones ment for jewelery rangers forage that can be coned as a skill for them tracking 2 but even though we get these they remain 2 stinky to call a trade skill for us.<BR>        and as for the one who thought this didnt do well read my other sugestions on page one since you like us to be unique i think a backstab song that upgrades to a dot backstab song would do such.  i proposed the broken dru rings be made minstral rings IMHO that tavern port wouldnt be good 2 many taverns around the world and what if you ended up in the bad town taverns THINK ABOUT THAT "CAN I GET A BEER PLEASE".  NO BUT YOU CAN DIE AND PROLY NEVER GET YOUR CORPSE AGAIN!! DOES THAT SOUND GOOD!!!!!!!!! my trade skill idea i think youll understand the reason i proposed this come on bards should get a luxery if they are basically made of trade skill classes im sorry for my bad paragraphes i hope you take more consern under this after you finish well if you guys gime the ok on trade skill or a mod version i would like to know AND ILL REPEAT INSTUMENTS SHOULD BE MADE BY ALL NOT JUST BARDS.
