</FONT><HR>"Rangers got a cap of 200, Bards of 100, Druids of 20. I would bet my life's savings that, when Verant did this, they did not in any way believe that this made Rangers 1st, Druids 2ND and Bards 3RD. When they designed tracking, they thought that a higher number was better, and they balanced the classes for that."<P>Yes, and later on they agreed that druids should be better than bards at tracking. Remember Verant isn't a single mind. One person may decide that druids should have a ridiculously low skill cap, assign the value, and it doesn't get closely reviewed until many months later. <P>Just because it comes out that way at release doesn't mean it's right. Like hybrids paying ridiculous experience penalties at release wasn't right. Like dividing experience in a totally uneven way wasn't right. Like making rogues useless in groups and useless soloers at release wasn't right. Like a death penalty twice as large as that we see today was total overkill on risk/reward and arguably wasn't right. Like making the grouping bonus utterly trivial wasn't right. <P>Verant makes mistakes, they're human. The game has no obligation to freeze it's evolution and correction of mistakes at release. It's not that kind of game.<P>"To say that they need to adjust tracking to make Druids 2nd best is just bogus reasoning. The only reason to bother to adjust tracking at this date for Druids is if Druids are in some way underpowered at levels where tracking matters. Are they? Hardly. Giving the easiest and most flexible 1-50 class in the game more 1-50 stuff just boggles me."<P>Fixing an inconsistency isn't a valid reason to do something anymore?<P>"All of this "why do you care what another class gets" logic is just self-serving blather. If that's true, then give every class in the game the ability to port their groups to any Druid circle on the planet, and let us all cast Circle of Winter. Druids won't care, right? NOT."<P>Bullpoopie. I'll make this very clear, if it doesn't hurt your role in the group, you have no justification to complain about another class's improvements. Rangers have nearly double the tracking cap, and the ranger-exclusive filtering tools are WAY more powerful than any of the whiners in this thread are giving credit to. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>As far as I recall the quote that the druids had requested it, refered to Verent leaving their skill at 50 when they in the past wanted to raise it, because it used to be that having a higher skill just made it harder to track.<P>So now that there is a scroll bar, it makes sense to raise to a higher level than the bard since that is what they (Verent) wanted it to be all along, but didnt at the request of the druids.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Agree's with Kenross. My point is that with each of the 'sharing' of skills/spell we all become jack-of-all-trades.  I would like to see a game where each class has a purpose.  <P>And tracking is important, it tells u if a room next to u has respawned, to look for named mobs.<P>My point is i want each class to have a class defining skill/spell.  A role in the bigger picture.  When i think of Rangers, I think of masters of the outdoors. If u need something to track, u should call a ranger.  Sarcasm:  Don't need a ranger, I can track.  &lt;--- Necro: end Sarcasm.  But VI hates necros, bad example, how about shamans instead.  Hey if another class shares a skill/spell, how does that hurt another class? Eventually for class balance all classes will have the same skill/abilities/spells...this will hurt the uniqueness of each class, making each class lemmings.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Raising of the Druid tracking skill won't do anything for them. In fact, it will hurt them because now they just get more clutter in their track window even if they can use a scroll bar.<P>They still will only get the most recent spawn at top and have no idea which mob on their list is closer.<P>This is a "nerf" to druid tracking actually.

</FONT><HR>Griffen, go look at a rangers spell list, pick out all the non buff spells with a casting time over 3 seconds that a ranger will use in combat. Then come back and retract your statment.<P>The only ones are flamestrike, stinging swarm, and the 54 dot. No ranger casts flamestrike, the mana cost simply doesnt make it worth it, same for the dot's unless solo or kiting. Snare, ensnare, and the majority of the other spells are all less than 3 seconds. This change is laughable at best for rangers, i dont think it helped paladins at all, and im not sure if it helps SK's that much.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

You are arguing that Rangers should not care if Druids get more Tracking because Tracking is not valuable.  But if it were not valuable, it would not be worth giving more of it to Druids.  Of course it's valuable, that's why you want it, it's why whoever is advocating for this improvement at Verant wants Druids to have it and why Rangers don't want you to have it.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Mennion, That was also only one of the several changes that improved a rangers casting ability.<P>The more mana thing was huge!  So much so, a level 48 ranger friend was able to kite a Blue mob in DL to the point of it running without any melee.  No, he didn't have any extra wisdom gear.  He didn't have any uber items.  He has no planer gear.  He's using Silvered leggings and the mid range quested ranger gear.  He needed to finish it off with melee, but, he was able to kite a blue down that much none the less.  Are you denying that the recent improvements on the ranger class have made them much more effective at casting?<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>I never said that tracking had no value or was unwanted.  I just don't see how you can use tracking to any advantage.  Do you really think that groups are going to decide they need you depending on how well you can track?  LOL no.  In my over 160 days played I have NEVER heard anyone judge anyone else based on tracking ability.  So I ask again:  How does it hurt you?  What "advantage" are you losing?  If someone wants a ranger in their group it's because of melee damage and snare.  And you don't see me griping about rangers getting to use "our" spells do you?  No, because I don't care what you do.<P>"All of this "why do you care what another class gets" logic is just self-serving blather. If that's true, then give every class in the game the ability to port their groups to any Druid circle on the planet, and let us all cast Circle of Winter. Druids won't care, right? NOT"<P>Now this is where you are wrong  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif">  Do you know how annoying it gets when all you ever hear is "Can u port me plz?".  Most of the time I don't mind porting but it does get on one's nerves when you spend half your online time playing for other people.  So no, I wouldn't cry if everyone had the ability to port to wherever I could, just means I have more free time.<P>I, for one, would like to be able to track better.  Do I believe it would give me an advantage over anyone?  Nope, but as I said, it would be nice to track at least as far as I can see.  Am I going to cry if I don't get a skill cap increase?  Nope and I haven't seen a valid excuse as to why others will cry if I do.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

All you managed to point out 5 of my least cast spells. =)<P>Harmony- Why would anyone cast this during combat when the casting time change would matter? I'm still not convinced this would fall under 'non-benifical.'<P>Immolate- I never cast it, ever. It lasts 1 minute and draws a LOT extra agro due to its debuff nature. -18ac isn't worth me spending the entire duration of the spell with auto attack off trying to jolt a mob back onto a warrior. Even if it helps others get in a little more damage, they lose all of mine.<P>Firestrike- 302 damage? I out melee that even in the reduced casting time, even more so when you consider resists.<P>Drones of Doom- Same as above... not worth the cast time. Besides, if it DID do any significant damage I'd need to back off on my melee to compensate... might as well save the mana and fight.<P>Nulify Magic- Only one you mention that I might actually cast... might. 95% of the time the mobs are hit with Turgors as soon as they arrive, no way in hell I'm gonna be the one to dispell that.<P>On tracking:<BR>When the changes were announced, were not rangers promised exclusive use of the scroll bar? I can't recall exactly... I'd need to go look for the post.<BR>What I wouldn't mind seeing is:<P>All: In con color.<BR>Bards: 100 skill, track defaults to sort by range, no scroller.<BR>Druids: 100 skill(maybe?), Track defaults to sort by range, scroller added.<BR>Ranger: As is, perhaps more range now that its not as much a liability.

</FONT><HR>&lt;sigh&gt; Ok, I have one character that I play and it's a Ranger. I played a Rogue on Tunare after EQ's initial release, but I quickly got annoyed by the broken and "soon to be implemented" poisoning skills.  Needless to say, I quit. I came back about a year later and started a Ranger on Luclin. Ironically, Rogues' poisoning skills were finally implemented shortly after starting this second character, heh. I love my class in spite of the reputation many others associate with it (i.e. crunchy/quick to die/manasink, etc.), but I find the responses to Keltan's initial post discouraging. I feel he failed to fully represent why this feels like a slap in the face to the Ranger community. I personally have no problems giving druids a tracking increase, but I am sickened by the fact that over the past year and a half Rangers, Sunmoon in particular, have lobbyed Verant with our LEGITIMATE defensive concerns. The release of Kunark and now Velious introduced a whole new breed of hard-hitting MoB. The recent class balancing changes seem to be a step in the right direction, to an extent, but Rangers still have the SAME defensive cap as WIS based casters (200). Now the argument has been made time and again that raw AC provides damage mitigation (I may be hit, but my AC should lessen the force of the blow) whereas raw defensive skill provides damage avoidance (I step out of the way and the MoB fails to connect). I chose a Ranger because I wanted a mix of melee and spell casting abilities. I knew I would sacrifice AC by not being able to wear plate, but was made to believe we were an agile chain based class, so assuming I were to be hit, I'd take more damage than a warrior probably would, but this didn't seem like such an issue since I would be agile and nimble, quickly side-stepping blows, etc. This is, of course, not the case. The recenent class balancing changes brought Pallys and SKs up to their Warrior parents defensive cap and Rangers were given their Warrior parents offensive cap. Hmmm. I would gladly trade our recent offensive increases for our sorely lacking defense. The overall increase in our offensive output as compared to warriors seems marginal at best. Why is it Rangers are billed as having a lesser AC as their weakness when the reality is, we give up: AC, defensive skill, and HPs? That's a triple penalty. It's late, I'm tired, and Howwl has made this argument on numerous other occasions better than myself. I guess what I'm trying to say is, "Sure, raise druid's tracking, but if you're going to do that, at least listen to what many dead Rangers have been trying to bang through your thick skulls for a year and a half. There is NO logical reason a Ranger should share a druid's defense!! No, our defense shouldn't be as high or higher than a Pally/SK, but for god's sake a druid's defense?! They're leather based, we are chain (like Rogues( hmm..what's their defense at again? Oh yeah, higher than a Ranger! And Rogues fight from behind most of the time anyway.../annoyed). And for those of you lining up to throw in your, "Oh but you get Jolt." 2cp. All I have to say is, "Yeah, we do. At 51." Ranger mortality rates start to become an issue well before 51 (see 40 on up). Interesting that it becomes an issue at the level where other melees start to move beyond the 200 defense wall. I have no intention of quitting or switching classes and I think I know how to keep myself alive pretty well (turn-off attack and back out of combat), but this is hardly a solution. Just once, I'd like Verant or Absor to LOGICALLY justify their reasoning for Rangers' defensive cap. Go ahead and increase the Druid tracking cap not a problem, but while you're at it think over the Ranger defense issue again, I know a lot of you don't think of it as an issue, but it is. Example, in EW the other day fighting an Elder Snow griffin. Went from ~1250 HP to ~580 in two triple hit sessions for 109 and that was with full AC gear on (AC: 854). Sorry for post length, it is my first, but I felt this thread had turned into a class-envy issue and I don't believe that's the way it was intended.  Maybe I'm wrong though.../shrug.<P>                               Dasein I'Sabbah<BR>                            44th Season Ranger<BR>                                        Luclin<BR>  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

Find just the right MOB to solo without having to run all over the map looking for them (a VERY useful thing for Druids, less so far Bards, hardly important for Rangers)<BR>3.

</FONT><HR>Uh, Pantheon, I think you blew your own argument when you noted that Warriors have no class-defining skill when all these other hybrids did, yet who's left out in the end? The hybrids. Class defining skills apparently mean squat. Especially tracking. It's nice, but it's a utility skill. If you're not participating in damage dealing, damage taking, crowd control, buffing/debuffing, or healing your class defining skills are pointless. Those are the key areas, and I think there's room for overlap. Rangers and other hybrids should be valued for versatility, not for a skill that recycles once every 45 minutes or that allows them to find mobs.

</FONT><HR>I find this entire thread incredibally entertaining. I really don't see why Rangers are complaining, other than the fact that it must be so ingained into thier very being that they can't possible help themselves...<P>Druids and Rangers are two of a kind. they are complimentary classes who's roots and origins are so deeply intertwined that it's hard to say which came first. Rangers are battle druids. A very large portion of their spells are DRUID spells. They share many, many abilities, many of which can be considered class defining. They both track, forage, sow, snare, dot, kite, nuke, buff, and many many other things...<P>So Druid are tracking things a little better. How does this hurt rangers? Druids are going to be useing this extended ability in one of two ways. they are going to be useing it to find a particular type of mob, (or more importantly, just to see if it is up so that they puller can go find it) or they are going to use to to make soloing a little easier.  In case one, they are helping any group that doesn't have a ranger and it's an improvement to everyone involved. In case two they're just doing their own thing and not hurting anyone. In either situation, Rangers have no reason to complain. Rangers got a lot of major improvements in the past few months. They were the first to start recieving enhancements in the name of "balance". <P>All things considered, Tracking is a frill skill anyway. It's something that nice to have, but hardly necessary, and certainly not something "class defining". I'm sure if you really put your minds to it, you can find something more worth to whine about. You always do...<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Tracking, in and of itself, doesn't strike me as the reason for such disillusionment in the overall Ranger community. The source seems to lie a bit deeper than that: what makes a Ranger so special?<P>As someone noted, a Ranger is a hybrid of the Warrior and Druid class. We are not their equals though. <P>A Warrior will always be a better tank because of a much higher AC and two, three, sometimes even four times as many hitpoints. As much as I love my Ranger, I know that I cannot soak the damage the way a Warrior can, nor can I avoid it. This last patch gave Rangers the same offensive skill caps as a Warrior, making a Ranger even more powerful in combat... assuming, as has been said, we "don't get hit."  <IMG SRC="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/smile.gif"><P>A Druid has a vast array of spells available. A Druid can be the group's healer, the group's buffer, or can work purely as a damage machine with DoT and DD spells. This is why Druids can solo. This is why they can quad kite. This is what makes Druids valuable to a group, especially pre-50. A Ranger has a limited number of spells, and all of them are received long after the Druid has them. You will not see many groups saying, "Group needs Ranger as healer." Since they are from the same spell lines, they are often overwritten by their parent class, or by others who have more powerful spells in the same vein.<P>Someone noted the spell-related perks Rangers have received... the increased mana pool was given to all hybrids, as they were being doubly penalized (spells cost more AND the mana pool was lower). So I can have the same manapool as a Druid my level...  how many Rangers will sacrifice AC for wisdom? Not many. How many Rangers will step back from a fight and do nothing but cast? Not many. Sure, we CAN do it..  that doesn't mean it's a good way to do it though.<P>And spellcasting has a speed boost for all hybrids. This was more of a hybrid balancing gimmick than anything. A hybrid, wethr it be Ranger, Paladin, or Shadowknight, stands in the thick of the fight, shoulder to shoulder with the Warriors, Monks, and Rogues. If we're getting pounded on, we can't cast. If we step out of combat to cast, we do less damage. So the speed was upped to both make the hybrids more atractive to players, and to make the spells somewhat useful to them as well.<P>So what makes a Ranger unique from Warriors and Druids? Paladins and Shadowknights each get a unique ability -- Lay of Hands for one, Harm Touch for the other. So what does a Ranger get that is so unique? <P>Tracking? Archery? These are the two things that pop to mind for most people. It's the image of a "Ranger" that most people have... the stealthy hunter, tracking his quarry mercilessly across any terrain, finally unleasing a torrent of arrows upon them.<P>The game works to emphasize this image... the symbol of the Ranger class is the bow. The "Official Players Guide," as referenced to buyers in the back of the game manual, describes Rangers as, "Rangers' skill with the bow and arrow are unmatched by any other class in Norrath."  The coverart for Kunark displays a Rangerly type standing back from the fight, aiming his bow at the party's foe.<P>However, reality gives us a different "image." Archery is not unique to the Ranger class. The bow can be used by most melee classes. Rangers are not the only ones to get criticals with archery -- Warriors can as well. The Trueshot discipline is great... if you're 55 or higher, a goal many Rangers will never see (myself included). And even Trueshot has been noted as being disappointing.. acurracy with the discipline is sometimes no better than normal archery accuracy, and damage is often little better.<P>Verant has made it quite clear, on numerous occassions, that they do not want archery to be a viable form of primary combat. How many people here will step back from a fight and do nothing but pluck arrows at their target, letting the rest of the party go melee with it? The only times I see people use a bow is when they are pulling or soloing, and I can solo just as well without a bow as I can with it.<P>So what about Tracking? To date, Rangers have the highest skill in this. Plus, we have an assortment of filters and a scrollbar. But everyone has the scrollbar, and the ability to sort players out of their tracklist. And now Druids are being bumped to just 75 points below a Ranger in terms of skill. In and of itself, not a bad thing, IMHO. But what does this do to the Ranger "image?" A Druid can track almost as well as a Ranger now (a 159 tracking gave me a view of the entire southeast corner of South Karana, and this was well before scrollbars or playerfilters were implemented). Without using filters, I can scroll down a track list and pick out my target -- I did it four consecutive times in Greater Faydark to snag the Brownie that spawns there, with no filters or special sorting... just a scrollbar. <P>So what makes a Ranger so special? Why choose a Ranger over a Warrior or a Druid? What sets the Ranger class apart as a whole?<P>Can't answer those questions? <P>THAT is what many Rangers are upset about. <P>Tracking is just the topic that brought the feelings out. Frankly, I don't care one way or the other what a Druid's Tracking skill is at... it got boosted? Congrats, more power to em. It's meaningless to me, personally. What dismays me though is the way the Ranger class has developed over the last two years. What makes us stand out? What makes us needed? What makes us so special? Why make a Ranger instead of another class? <P>After two years you'd think there'd be an answer to that.<P>Lexandra the Rabbit Slayer<BR>Ranger of 52 seasons</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Love the first line.  How much more can you take something out of context?<P>At the beginning there where a lot of issues with tracking. Druid tracking was found to be broken and Bards had much better tracking, yet druids where suppose to be better trackers then Bards.  I think track peaked out at 20 originally.  Tracking on a whole was broken.  So in order to fix Druid tracking discussions took place and the result was to raise Track to 50 becasue the Bard track at 75 would be less effecient.  And too high  would make us almost as good as Rangers even with all the other tracking problems.<P>Now that they made lots of changes to track they needed to re-look at Druid track.  Since it was supposed to be better then Bards, the recent changes made it worse then Bards.  So they've raised the cap.  And this raising will not make druids better trackers then Rangers especially since ranger track has a lot more options.<P>Keryia Winterwolf<BR>Druid (who remembers a track of 20 and being impossible to find Thistle)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>More revisionism, Keryia.<P>When the game started Druids were deliberately given a Tracking lower than Bards, skill 20 to the Bard's 100 (not 75).  No one realised that lower skills could perform as well as or better than higher skills at that time, so any claim that this was so Druids would be better than Bards is doublethink at best.<P>Some months later it was decided to raise the Druid cap.  *No one* at Verant ever claimed this was being done to make Druids better than Bards.  Mr Wrinn did say in a post to Usenet that HE felt Druids should track better than Bards, but he also admitted that it couldn't be done because the Bard cap was already too high.<P>Once the decision to raise the cap was made, Verant's people talked to the Druid community about how much to raise it.  50 and 75 were the two numbers that came up and the Druids chose 50.  That was an ignorant and short-sighted (rimshot) choice, as any Ranger over level 20 could tell you that the 'sweet spot' was skill 100 -- but I digress.<P>This all happened back in the day when Verant's people would emerge from their gated police state here and post to alt.games.everquest, so if you know of a site that's archiving that group in particular or Usenet in general you can probably find the posts.  (Deja sold its archive to some other clowns who haven't gotten it working past 8/00, alas.)  You will also find, incidentally, that Rangers protested that change, too.<P>Making Druids better trackers than Bards is a CHANGE.  They were not better than Bards in beta, they were not better than Bards at live, they were not better than Bards when their skill was increased to 50 and they're not better than Bards today.  If this change goes live it will represent an improvement to the class, and it will devalue both Bard and Ranger Tracking.<P>In a perfect world...well, in a perfect world neither Druids nor Bards would HAVE Tracking.  In a tolerable world, Druids would have the 100 cap and Bards the 50.  But that's not the way it played out, and Druids should simply have to deal with it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#d0c0a6">

</FONT><HR>Tilara, Just because you don't use those spells doesn't mean other Rangers don't.  I know Lexandra uses those spells.  She's a RL Friend of mine.  And what's with discounting Harmony because it's not a combat spell?  Tracking isn't a combat skill!  IT's relavant because it's a skill we share.  <P>Lexy, 75 skill points isn't minor.  75 skill points is a very large difference.  Verant has even stated.  That the ONLY reason druid didn't have a higher Tracking cap is because they asked them to not make the change.  When there was no scroll bar, a larger tracking score was worse.  They are now moving the score to where it was originally intended since there is now a scroll bar.<P>I know for a fact that Ranger, including Lexandra, used to think Druid tracking was better than a ranger's for that very reason.  Verant considered doing the same for RAngers, but, I wonder how they would of reacted to a 150 point skill drop.<P>Lexy, Rangers will not swap out for wisdom gear, no, even though you yourself have +6 wisdom gear you pull out from time to time.  Rangers have indeed recieved spells, and magical power that has improved their casting ability.  This is just plain truth.  There is no way you can say that it's not true.  Druids getting a 75 point increase in tracking is no worse than Rangers getting more mana, faster spell casting, and more druid spells.<P>Again, Tracking is not your class defining ability.  You have none.  Just like wizards have none.  Just like Druids have none, just like Clerics have none.  Just like Mages have none.  Very few classes have a class defining ability.  That is an ability that they share with no other class.<P>Most druids are happy that your class has been improved.  Why can't you be happy for the druid class?  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DECEB5">

</FONT><HR>Ok, to put things into perspective.  Math time.  Math is not my strongest subject, so please someone confirm my number.<P>The area of a circle is PiR^2. that's the formula for figuring out the surface area that tracking covers.  Let's say a Ranger can see something 2000 feet a head of him on tracking.  That would cover a surface area of 12560000 square feet. (over 12million quare feet).<P>Using the same ratio of skill for range.  A ranger with a skill of 125 would be able to see 1250 feet ahead.  That's 4906250 SqFt (less than 5 million).  <P>That's a difference over Well over 7 million square feet. (7653750)  I wonder how much you can fit into 7 million square feet.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#5a5758" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061765-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061765.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/061765-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=061765&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=061765&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
